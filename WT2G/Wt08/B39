<H2>The Families v. O.J. Simpson</H2>

<P><B>The Defense Goes On The Attack</B><BR>
<IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/casefiles/simpson.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=0 BORDER=0>SANTA MONICA, Oct. 24 (Noon) -- Plaintiffs attorneys finished their opening statements in the O.J. Simpson civil trial, painting a picture of Simpson becoming more controlling and obsessive during the final months of his relationship with Nicole. Lead defense lawyer Robert Baker began his opening statement, outlining Simpson's alibi and portraying him as an all-American hero. Baker also spent a substantial amount of time attacking Nicole's character.</P>

<P>John Kelly, who represents the estate of Nicole Brown Simpson, took about 30 minutes to finish his opening statement from Wednesday. Focusing on Simpson and Nicole's relationship, Kelly took the jury through the Simpson's attempted reconciliation in May 1993 to their final breakup in May 1994, when, he said, the relationship went "into a freefall." Kelly also further discussed the set of keys to Nicole's Bundy property police confiscated from Simpson after his low-speed chase. Nicole, Kelly said, realized the keys were gone on June 7, 1994 and searched her house for them. Plaintiffs contend that whoever murdered Nicole and Ron Goldman used a key to come in the back gate.</P>

<P>In the defense's opening statement, Baker went into great detail explaining Simpson's whereabouts between 9:35 p.m. and 10:55 p.m. on June 12, 1994. After returning from Mcdonald's with Kato Kaelin, Simpson "fussed around in the kitchen," looked for a particular golf club he wanted to bring to Chicago, hit some golf balls in his yard, read a little bit, and watched some television. Baker also told the jury that Simpson, while in the shower, heard the limousine driver buzzing to get into the gate, but figured he would let himself in. Because, Simpson is a bachelor, Baker told the jury, "he doesn't have anybody who is always there" to account for him.</P>

<P>Baker also began a serious attack on Nicole's character, telling the jury that she aborted a baby she had with a boyfriend and attended wild parties with prostitutes and people she didn't even know. "You'll hear the name Heidi Fleiss, you'll hear about prostitutes, and you'll hear about drugs," Baker said.</P>

<P>In contrast Simpson, Baker told the jury, won the pro football most valuable player award three times, was an all-pro seven times, and was a beloved corporate spokesman. "He never spit in the face of an umpire," Baker said. "He never, ever told a fan he didn't have time to sign an autograph."</P>

<P>Baker continues his opening statement after a lunch break. </P>

<H2>The Families v. O.J. Simpson</H2>

<P><B>Simpson's Lawyer: 'Our Client Is No Murderer'</B><BR>
<IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/casefiles/simpson.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=0 BORDER=0>SANTA MONICA, Oct. 24 (Evening) -- Defense Attorney Robert Baker finished his opening statement in the O.J. Simpson Civil trial Thursday afternoon, contending that much of the blood evidence was contaminated, that Simpson didn't have enough time to commit the murders, and telling jurors to listen carefully to Simpson when he takes the witness stand. Baker also claimed that Nicole Brown Simpson specifically asked Ronald Goldman to bring her mother's glasses on June 12, 1994 because they had a date that night.</P>

<P>"If you believe Mr. Simpson, if you believe O.J. Simpson, you must find him not liable," Baker said in closing. "Our client is no murderer."</P>

<P>Court will begin at 9:00 a.m. Friday with six scheduled witnesses, all of whom will speak to the events and timeline leading up to the murders. Due to be called are Mezzaluna manager Karen Crawford; Mezzaluna bartender Stuart Tanner; and Robert Heidstra, a dog walker who heard a young male voice say 'hey, hey, hey;' heard a gate clang shut, and then saw a sports utility vehicle driving away. Three other dog walking neighbors of Nicole are also scheduled to take the stand: Louis Karpf, Steven Schwab, and Sukru Boztepe.</P>

<P>While continuing his opening statement Thursday afternoon, Baker said he will present evidence that shows it was impossible, according to the plaintiff's timeline of the murders, for Simpson to have killed Goldman and Nicole.  The plaintiffs are relying on the testimony of Heidstra, which places the murders around 10:35 or 10:40 p.m. But Baker said his experts will show that the struggle resulting in the double murder lasted between 10 and 15 minutes and was so violent that the assailant would have been covered in blood. Even "gunning his Bronco, that gets him to the house at 10:54," Baker told the jury, noting that Simpson was seen by limousine driver Allan Park at 10:55 p.m.</P>

<P>Baker also attacked a key piece of the plaintiffs' evidence, the photo of Simpson wearing size 12 Bruno Magli shoes, calling it doctored.  It was raining the day the picture was taken, Baker said, but in the photo the shoes are clearly dry. As expected the defense brought up the familiar theory of contaminated evidence, even borrowing a phrase  from Simpson criminal lawyer Johhnie Cochran, telling the jury the LAPD crime lab is "a cesspool of contamination." The defense, also in a manner that imitated Cochran, revealed it will call some surprise witnesses--two people Rollerblading by Nicole's home hours before the killings who will say they saw a white or Hispanic woman.</P>

<P>Outside the courthouse, only one protester greeted Simpson as he walked into court -- a Howard Stern fan and holdover from the criminal trial. He's a </P>well-know event chaser in the Los Angeles area.             

<H2>The Families v. O.J. Simpson</H2>

<P><B>Plaintiffs On The Fast Track</B><BR>
<IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/casefiles/simpson.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=0 BORDER=0>SANTA MONICA, Oct. 25 (Noon) -- The morning session here in the O.J. Simpson civil trial ended after 95 minutes because the plaintiffs ran out of witnesses. Both sides sped through their questioning of Mezzaluna employees Karen Crawford and Stewart Tanner; dog walker Robert Heidstra; and Nicole Brown Simpson neighbor Louis Karpf -- in contrast to the criminal trial where their testimony took about twice as long. Only two other witnesses are scheduled for today and they were told to arrive in court after the lunch break.</P>

<P>The morning's most important witness was Heidstra, who was called by Simpson in the criminal trial, but today testified for the plaintiffs. Heidstra said he started on his nightly dog walk at 10:15 p.m. Fifteen minutes later, he heard Nicole's Akita barking and wanting to avoid a confrontation with his dogs, Heidstra changed direction. It was a  "confused, panicky bark, not an attack bark," Heidstra told the jury.  Crossing the alley behind Nicole's house at  about 10:35 p.m., Heidstra heard a young, clear, male voice say "hey, hey, hey" and then an older, deeper, male voice talking very quickly. Fifteen seconds later, Heidstra heard a gate clang. At 10:40 or 10:45 p.m., Heidstra testified that he saw a white, Jeep-like vehicle speed away, heading South.</P>

<P>On cross-examination, defense lawyer Robert Baker asked Heidstra, who works as a car detailer near O.J. Simpson's Rockingham home, if the fastest way to get there would be to head South. No, Heidstra replied, but going that way the driver could take a different route that has no traffic lights. Baker also pointed out several small inconsistencies in Heidstra's criminal testimony. Heidstra was on the stand for slightly less than an hour today, in the criminal trial he testified for two and a half hours.</P>

<P>Karen Crawford, the Sunday manager at Mezzaluna testified that she took calls from Juditha Brown and Nicole about Juditha's glasses that were left at the restaurant. Stewart Tanner told the jury that he and Ron Goldman had plans to go out that night after work, although they did not because Tanner was tired. Both testified that Ron and Nicole were not dating. Louis Karpf took the stand for eight minutes today, testifying that he arrived home from the airport and saw the Akita coming down the street when he went to check his mail at 10:45, or 10:50 p.m. at the latest. On cross-examination, Daniel Leonard pointed out that Karpf told police her arrived home at 10:55 or 11:00 p.m., and would have seen the dog later.</P>

<P>Only one protester greeted Simpson as he arrived at the courthouse today. Several other protesters are at the courthouse, but their protests are not Simpson-related. Celebrity author Dominik Dunne is in court for the first time today. The witnesses walking into court today have been greeted by hordes of cameras as television journalists try to get pictures for their stories. Karen Crawford's boyfriend, apparently unhappy with the attention, spit at the camera crews.</P>

<P>This afternoon scheduled witnesses are: Steven Schwab and Sukru Boztepe, both neighbors of Nicole.</P>

<H2>The Families v. O.J. Simpson</H2>

<P><B>Families Present New Timeline</B><BR>
<IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/casefiles/simpson.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=0 BORDER=0>SANTA MONICA, Oct. 25 (Evening) -- The afternoon session in O.J. Simpson's civil trial here lasted less than an hour as the jury heard testimony from dog walker Steven Schwab and Sukru Boztepe, who found the body of Nicole Brown Simpson. Apologizing to the jury for the short day, Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki told them he asked the lawyers to "tighten up the witness list" so there will be full days of testimony in the future.</P>

<P>Court is out of session for the weekend and will resume Monday at 8:30 a.m. Scheduled to testify are several Los Angeles Police Department officers involved in the investigation: Officer Robert Riske, Lt. Frank Spangler, Office Michael Terrazas, and Det. Ronald Phillips. Expected later in the week are other members of the LAPD, including Sgt. David Rossi, police photographer Jonah Wilson,  Det. Tom Lange, and Det. Phillip Vannatter. </P>

<P>Schwab told the jury about how he found Nicole's dirty and blood-spattered Akita at 10:55 p.m. on June 12, 1994, while taking his own dog for a walk. Schwab, who also testified in the criminal trial, always walked his dog on Sunday nights during the half-hour break between the Dick Van Dyke and Mary Tyler Moore shows. After seeing the Akita and hearing its "loud barking, [like it was] trying to get someone's attention or wake someone up," Schwab took the dog back to his home. Not wanting to keep the Akita over night because he had a cat, Schwab gave the dog to his neighbor Boztepe. The defense team did not cross-examine Schwab, who was on the witness stand for 20 minutes.</P>
 
<P>In his 15-minute testimony, Boztepe told the jury how he ran into Schwab in the courtyard of their apartment building and agreed to keep the dog overnight. The Akita, however, was acting nervous and scratching the door, so he and his wife decided to take it for a walk. As they walked by Nicole's house, the dog pulled them toward the property. Peering in, Boztepe said, he saw "a lady lying down in a pool of blood."  When the police arrived, Boztepe pointed them to the crime scene. During a quick cross-examination, defense lawyer Robert Baker asked several questions about the police who first arrived on the scene. But Boztepe said he could not answer because he was standing across the street and they disappeared behind the bushes. Boztepe also testified in the criminal trial.</P>

<P>The timeline witnesses called thus far in the civil trial have spent about half as much time on the stand than they did in the criminal proceedings. That is largely because the defense is not disputing the plaintiffs' timeline for the murders. The plaintiffs have put on witnesses who pin the time of the murders around 10:35 and 10:40 p.m. The defense contends the murders happened five or ten minutes later, but the plaintiffs' timeline still allows them to say it was impossible for Simpson to return home and appear calm and clean when he was seen by limousine driver Allan Park at 10:55 p.m.</P>

<P>Simpson was not in court this afternoon.</P>

<H2>The Families v. O.J. Simpson</H2>

<P><B>Police Describe Crime Scene</B><BR>
<IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/casefiles/simpson.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=0 BORDER=0>SANTA MONICA, Oct. 28 (Noon) -- The first two Los Angeles Police officers who arrived at the crime scene took the stand today in the O.J. Simpson civil trial. Officers Robert Riske and Miguel Terrazas, who were partners on June 13, 1994, told the jury how they found the bodies, one glove, and a knit cap; how they were careful to not to disturb the crime scene; and how they saw blood on the back gate at Nicole Brown Simpson's Bundy condominium.</P>

<P>The officers' recollections of blood on the back gate is important because the LAPD criminalists did not collect the blood until several weeks after the murder. Both Riske and Terrazas also testified that only one glove was found at the murder scene. The defense will likely contend that the blood could have been planted and that a second glove was planted at Simpson's Rockingham home. Plaintiffs' attorney John Kelly, who represents the estate of Nicole, walked the two officers step by step through their work at the crime scene from about 12:15 until 7:15 a.m. on June 13, 1994. Both the plaintiffs in their examination, and the defense on cross-examination, spent a lot of time asking the officers to account for the whereabouts of Det. Mark Fuhrman.</P>

<P>On cross examination, defense attorney Robert Blaiser, who also worked on Simpson's criminal defense, hammered at Riske for using the phone in Nicole's kitchen to call his supervisor -- thus contaminating it with his fingerprints. Blaiser also questioned Riske about his dark-blue, wool uniform, which could produce the same fiber evidence found at the Bundy and Rockingham crime scenes. In the criminal case prosecutors tried to show the fibers came from Simpson's blue-black sweatsuit. Blaiser was blocked by Judge Fujisaki from asking questions about the ice cream found in Nicole's house, and about possible elements of trace evidence that police could have contaminated in Nicole's house.</P>

<P>Terrazas is currently being cross examined by defense attorney Robert Baker. Also scheduled to take the stand today are Det. Frank Spangler, Riske's and Terrazas' boss, and Det. Ronald Phillips, Mark Fuhrman's partner.</P>

<P>Inside the courtroom, Fredric Goldman wept as a particularly gruesome photo of his son Ron's body was shown. O.J. Simpson was not in court this morning, but is supposed to be here this afternoon.</P>

<P><B>Simpson Lawyers Question Police</B><BR>
<IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/casefiles/simpson.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=0 BORDER=0>SANTA MONICA, Oct. 28 (Evening) -- Defense lawyers continued to pound away at the Los Angeles Police Department's investigation of the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman. On the stand Monday afternoon, Officer Miguel Terrazas was closely cross-examined about blood drops he says he saw on the back gate at Nicole's Bundy home. At one point, Terrazas misidentified a rust stain on an evidence  photo as blood. The defense began to cross examine Sgt. David Rossi late in the afternoon; he, too, did not identify all the blood evidence he was asked to by the plaintiffs.</P>

<P>Tuesday morning, the defense will continue its cross-examination of Rossi. Also scheduled to take the stand are Lt. Frank Spangler and Det. Ronald Phillips, Mark Fuhrman's partner.</P>

<P>During questioning by plaintiffs' attorney Edward Medvene, who represents Fredric Goldman, both Terrazas and Rossi  testified they saw only one glove at the crime scene -- two hours before Fuhrman arrived.</P>

<P>The defense again suffered a setback in its attempt to tell they jury that the police failed to preserve or find relevant evidence at the crime scene. Judge Fujisaki, who earlier in the day blocked the defense from asking questions about the ice cream found in Nicole's house and about possible elements of trace evidence police overlooked, further clarified his ruling. He told the defense it could only raise the issue if police spoiled or contaminated the evidence. Any evidence that was not collected, the judge said, is not relevant to the case.</P>

<P>"This is not a case against the Los Angeles Police Department for committing malpractice," Fujisaki said before the jury came in. "You're not going to be able to talk about the evidence they didn't find or failed to find."</P>

<P>Simpson was back in court this afternoon.</P>

<P><B>Finding Blood On Crime Scene Gate</B><BR>
<IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/casefiles/simpson.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=0 BORDER=0>SANTA MONICA, Oct. 29 (Noon) -- In an effort to prove evidence could not have been planted, the plaintiffs called a police officer who described finding a trail of blood from O.J. Simpson's Ford Bronco to his front door a few hours after the bodies of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman were discovered. </P>

<P>Officer Donald Thompson also testified that he found blood on a rear gate at the crime scene. </P>

<P>Thompson's spotting of the blood is important since it would have occurred several hours before Simpson gave a blood sample to police. Simpson's lawyers have suggested that the blood evidence may have been planted in a police conspiracy. </P>

<P>Thompson identified a droplet of blood from a photo of the gate at Nicole Brown Simpson's condominium shown to him by a lawyer for the plaintiffs. In cross-examination, Thompson was shown another picture of the gate and couldn't see the blood. He claimed that the photo was of a poor quality. </P>

<P>Earlier in the day, Sgt. David Rossi, who began his testimony Monday, also claimed that he saw blood on the gate. </P>

<H2>The Families v. O.J. Simpson</H2>

<P><B>Lange Guides Jury Through Crime Scene</B><BR>
<IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/casefiles/simpson.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=0 BORDER=0>SANTA MONICA, Oct. 31 (Noon) -- Court recessed after the 10:00 a.m. break because an alternate juror became ill. Retired Det. Tom Lange, who supervised the murder investigation, is currently on the stand.</P>

<P>The plaintiffs have been using Lange to guide the jury through the crime scene. With the courtroom lights dimmed to provide better viewing of the photographed exhibits, Lange has pointed out blood drops and bloody shoe prints at Nicole Brown Simpson’s condominium.</P>

<P>Some of the photographs have been so graphic that one juror seemed to turn away and a few others took deep breaths. Frederic and Kim Goldman, Ronald's father and sister, put their heads in their hands and did not look up at some of the exhibits. Nicole Brown Simpson's parents were not in court.</P>

<P>As Lange's testimony progressed, it became more likely that the plaintiffs would limit their questions to his work at the crime scene -- a possible shift in strategy. The plaintiffs could have used Lange’s testimony to introduced  Simpson's taped statement to Lange and Det. Philip Vannatter the day after the murders. However, that now appears to be unlikely, and the plaintiffs will probably introduce Simpson's statement when he takes the stand. The statement did not come into evidence during Simpson's criminal trial.</P>

<P>Simpson's own testimony has provoked a bit of controversy here. Defense attorneys said today that because of Simpson's pending child custody case he would be unavailable to testify from Nov. 12 through the end of the month. However, an attorney for Lou and Juditha Brown, who are currently caring for the children, said a deal could be worked out to allow Simpson to take the stand.</P>

<P>Court is scheduled to resume at 1:30 p.m. with Lange still being examined by Fredric Goldman’s attorney Edward Medvene. It is unclear if the alternate juror's illness will affect the rest of today's proceedings. The juror -- a white male who seems to be in his 30s and works in desktop publishing at a law firm -- reportedly changed blood-pressure medication recently and felt faint. He was taken from the courthouse to the hospital in an ambulance.</P>

<H2>The Families v. O.J. Simpson</H2>

<P><B>Simpson's Travel Bag Opened</B><BR>
<IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/casefiles/simpson.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=0 BORDER=0>SANTA MONICA, Oct. 31 (Evening) -- Retired Los Angeles Police Det. Tom Lange remained on the stand for the rest of the day in the O.J. Simpson civil trial, telling jurors what O.J. Simpson brought with him in his black leather bag during the infamous Bronco chase. Before Lange took the stand for the afternoon session, Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki dismissed an alternate juror who was rushed to the hospital earlier in the day because of complications from his blood pressure medicine.</P> 

<P>Court will resume on Friday at 9:00 a.m. with Lange, one of the two lead investigators in the double murder of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman, still testifying on cross-examination. Scheduled to be called after Lange is his former partner Philip Vannatter.</P>

<P>Two and a half years after Simpson fled police arrest in his friend A.C. Cowlings' Ford Bronco, a jury finally heard what Simpson had with him. Among the items, Lange testified, were a .357 revolver and six rounds of ammunition taken from the gun's cylinder, a mustache and goatee disguise with a receipt, changes of underwear, a few pairs of socks, numerous credit cards, Simpson's passport, a Pro Football Hall of Fame ring, and two or three sets of keys.</P>

<P>In their opening statement the plaintiffs argued that whoever committed the murders at Bundy needed keys to get in the back gate, and that that one of the sets of keys, which Simpson had in the Bronco was to Nicole's property. Lange also testified that when he arrived at the crime scene the night of the murders he saw blood on Nicole's back gate and only one dark-brown leather glove.</P>

<P>Lange's credibility, however, was seriously challenged on cross-examination by defense attorney Robert Baker. In a sometimes dismissive, sometimes incredulous tone, Baker tried hard to paint Lange as a liar. By contrasting Lange's testimony with his written report on the murder scene, Baker revealed a number of inconsistencies. The largest among them: Lange never wrote about blood drops on the back gate in his report.</P>

<P>The defense also sought to portray Lange as a bumbling cop who supervised a sloppy investigation. Baker hammered Lange for not beginning to process the evidence at the crime scene until six hours after the police arrived at Nicole's condominium. He questioned the decision to cover Nicole's body with a blanket, which could contaminate the evidence. Lastly, Baker mocked Lange for saying he left Nicole's property in the midst of an investigation to notify O.J. Simpson of her death and establish "a rapport" with him.</P> 

<P>"While you have a wealth of evidence at 875 S. Bundy," Baker asked, "it seemed like a good idea to go to Rockingham and establish a rapport with Mr. Simpson?"</P>

<P>In the hallway outside Judge Fujisaki's courtroom, Simpson and Fred Goldman exchanged words over nasty stares that have been flying back and forth between Simpson and Kim Goldman.</P>

<P>"Don't even give me any of your dirty looks," Goldman said to Simpson as they passed in the hall.</P>

<P>"I wasn't even looking at you, I was looking at your daughter, who was looking at me."</P>

<H2>The Families v. O.J. Simpson</H2>

<P><B>Defense Alleges Glove, Knit Hat Were Planted</B><BR>
<IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/casefiles/simpson.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=0 BORDER=0>SANTA MONICA, Nov. 1 (Noon) -- Admitting that some of the police work in the double murder of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman was "careless," retired Det. Tom Lange faced a withering attack on the witness stand in the O.J. Simpson civil trial. Through an often hostile cross-examination, defense attorney Robert Baker made new allegations that the glove and knit hat at the Bundy crime scene could have been planted.</P>

<P>At the end of the morning session, Baker wrapped up his cross-examination. Lange is expected to continuing testifying on re-direct and re-cross examination. His former partner Det. Philip Vannatter, is set to take the stand later today. Now retired, Vannatter was co-lead investigator on the murder investigation.</P>

<P>The new allegations of evidence planting have come in despite being expressly prohibited by Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki during pretrial motions. The plaintiffs have vehemently objected to this line of questioning. However, Fujisaki has refused to sustain the objections. Baker asked Lange very specific questions about the placement of the knit cap and brown leather glove -- trying to show that they could not have fallen naturally during the course of a struggle. The glove was found slightly under some foliage, and the knit cap was partially under the bar of a fence. Lange testified that it was impossible to know how the items ended up where they were, but maybe the cap was kicked under the fence during the struggle.</P>

<P>The defense spent much of the morning putting the police on trial, pointing out a number of incidents of sloppiness during the investigation. Baker mocked Lange for keeping a pendant collected from the crime scene in his desk drawer for 10 weeks before booking it into evidence. Lange also came under fire for taking home overnight a pair of O.J. Simpson's tennis shoes, and for not wearing protective covering over his shoes at the crime scene. This covering, known as a "bootie," is used to prevent the contamination of evidence.</P>

<P>"I've never worn booties at any crime scene, and I've never heard of any detective doing that," Lange replied.</P>

<P>Replied Baker: "Why? Is it too unmacho?"</P>
 
<P>Lange's police paperwork continued to be an issue, as it again contradicted his testimony. After describing a set of keys in his Thursday testimony, which Lange said were found in Simpson's black leather bag after the Bronco chase, Baker pointed out that the keys were not listed in the police department's property inventory of items in the bag. The plaintiffs are relying on the keys, purportedly to Nicole's property, to show Simpson could have entered the back gate and committed the murders. Lange was also forced to explain why he testified that he saw blood drops on the back gate to the Bundy property on June 13, but in his report made on July 3--the day the drops were actually collected by the LAPD--Lange noted that "additional blood drops" were collected.</P>

<H2>The Families v. O.J. Simpson</H2>

<P><B>Vannatter's Role Shortened</B><BR>
<IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/casefiles/simpson.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=0 BORDER=0>SANTA MONICA, Nov. 1 (Evening) -- In a surprise move Friday afternoon, the plaintiffs sharply limited their examination of retired Det. Philip Vannatter, asking him only about his handling of the blood samples taken from  O.J. Simpson and the bodies of murder victims Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman. As a result, the co-lead detective whose highly-charged testimony in the criminal trial captivated the nation, spent a mere 40 minutes on the stand.</P>

<P>Court ended early, at 3:30 p.m., to accommodate the religious practices of a juror. The proceedings are scheduled to reconvene Monday Nov. 4, at 8:30 a.m. Scheduled witnesses are LAPD Chief Chemist Gregory Matheson, who will likely summarize police record keeping of the blood evidence and discuss the blood on O.J.'s socks, and criminalist Dennis Fung, who will probably testify about the collection of the evidence. Also scheduled next week are LAPD criminalist Susan Brockbank who handled hair and fiber evidence; Bernie Douroux, the tow truck driver who secured Simpson's Bronco; glove expert Richard Rubin; and Brenda Vemich, the woman who sold two pairs of Aris Leather Light gloves, extra-large, at Bloomingdales. Expected later in the week are DNA witnesses.</P>
 
<P>Plaintiff's attorney John Kelly methodically led Vannatter through two and a half hours on June 13, 1994 when the detective took a vial of blood from the police station in downtown Los Angeles and handed it to criminalist Fung at Simpson's Rockingham home. The defense in Simpson's criminal trial called Vannatter one of the two "demons of deception" who helped carry out the police conspiracy to frame O.J (former Det. Mark Fuhrman was the other). Vannatter testified in that case for 11 hours, over four days.  Friday, in the civil trial, Vannatter testified on direct examination for only 11 minutes, telling the jury that he never opened, nor put in his pocket, the envelope that contained Simpson's blood.</P>

<P>With such a short, narrow direct-examination, the defense was able to cross-examine Vannatter for only 30 minutes. Defense Robert Baker skeptically asked Vannatter why he waited at the police station for 90 minutes with the envelope of blood on his desk before taking it to Fung.</P>

<P>"I hadn't eaten in 24 hours, I'd gotten up at three in the morning . . . and I'm 55 year-old-man," Vannatter responded.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>A New Theory of Sloppy Police Work Unveiled</B></font><BR>
<IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/casefiles/simpson.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=0 BORDER=0>SANTA MONICA, Nov. 4 (Noon) -- Gregory Matheson, the LAPD crime lab supervisor, took the stand this morning in the O.J. Simpson civil trial, testifying on a very limited scope about the collection and analysis of evidence from the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman. But on cross-examination, the defense began to lay ground for a new theory of police ineptitude that would explain how rare fibers from Simpson's Bronco were found on the knit cap and bloody glove recovered from the Bundy crime scene.</P>

<P>Matheson, in response to questions from defense attorney Robert Blaiser, admitted that a piece of carpet cut out of Simpson's Bronco was placed in a box along with the bloody glove and knit cap. The defense's conclusion: Maybe those fibers landed on the knit cap and glove while in police custody. Simpson's criminal lawyers never had to deal with the Bronco fibers because Judge Lance Ito forbid the prosecutors to introduce them because of a discovery violation.</P>

<P>Blaiser also probed Matheson about why the police changed the evidence number assigned to Simpson's blood sample. Simpson gave the sample to police on June 13, 1994, and police testified it was booked that same day. Blaiser, however, pointed out that the vial's original number was 18, but was changed to 17. The piece of evidence first numbered 17 was booked on June 14. The defense is trying to show that if Simpson's blood was kept a day later, the police would have had time to plant some of it.</P> 

<P>On direct examination, the plaintiffs chose not to ask Matheson specifically about most of the testing his office performed. However, Matheson did tell the jury that after conducting four basic blood tests, only one in 550 to 570 people would have matched some of the blood at the crime scene. Simpson's blood, Matheson said, did match. Matheson only briefly testified about Simpson's dark socks, telling the jury that when he saw them on June 29, he did not see any blood on them.</P>

<P>Simpson was not in court today. Lawrence Schiller, who wrote "American Tragedy," was among the visitors. Matheson is expected to testify for another hour in the afternoon session before criminalist Dennis Fung takes the stand.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>The Defense Attacks Criminalist Fung</B></font><BR>
<IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/casefiles/simpson.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=0 BORDER=0>SANTA MONICA, Nov. 4 (Evening) -- Los Angeles Police Department criminalist Dennis Fung took the stand Monday afternoon in the O.J. Simpson civil trial, taking the jurors through his collection of blood drops at the Bundy and Rockingham crime scenes. The defense, on cross-examination, sought to show that Fung missed collecting crucial evidence, and that the evidence he did collect was contaminated.</P>

<P>Fung will remain on the stand Tuesday morning as defense attorney Robert Blaiser continues his cross-examination. After Fung, criminalist Susan Brockbank, who handled hair and fiber evidence, is set to testify. The plaintiffs will then seek to present witnesses in an effort to try to link O.J. Simpson to the two gloves, including Mark Krueger, who photographed Simpson wearing similar gloves and, via her videotaped deposition, Brenda Vemich, the woman who sold Nicole two pairs of Aris Leather Light gloves, extra-large, at Bloomingdales. Expected later in the week is Harry Scull, the photographer who took the picture that purports to show Simpson wearing Bruno Magli shoes.</P>

<P>On cross-examination Monday afternoon, defense lawyers slammed Fung for inconsistencies with his previous testimony, for allowing a junior criminalist to collect evidence, and for taking directions from detectives that he knew would compromise the crime scene. Det. Tom Lange, Fung testified, told him to bring the glove found at Rockingham over to the Bundy condominium -- a move that could have contaminated the crime scene. Fung also said he didn't collect any blood on Nicole Brown Simpson's back gate because he did not see any. The defense also suggested that the two crime scenes were further cross-contaminated by police officers going back and forth, and from Nicole's Akita running around the Rockingham estate.</P>

<P>Blaiser asked Fung if an officer was assigned to keep the dog away.</P>

<P>No, Fung replied, "when the dog got near the stains we'd shoo him away."</P>

<P> Fung's limited 60-minute direct examination again frustrated defense lawyers who have not been allowed to question the witnesses beyond the scope of what they are asked by the plaintiffs. Late Friday, defense sought an emergency writ from the California state appellate court seeking to stop the civil trial until the appeals court could rule on whether or not this limitation was proper. This afternoon, the appeal was denied.</P>

<P>Gregory Matheson finished testifying earlier in the afternoon. On redirect examination he offered a response to the defense's new theory that rare fibers from Simpson's Bronco ended up on the knit cap and glove found at the Bundy crime scene because of cross-contamination. Matheson told the jury that although the LAPD did indeed keep a piece of Simpson's Bronco carpet in a box with the knit cap and glove from the Bundy crime scene, each piece of evidence was packaged separately.</P>

<P> Simpson was not in court today because he was undergoing routine psychological testing for his child custody trial.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Judge Refuses To Bar Intern From Courtroom</B></font><BR>
<IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/casefiles/simpson.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=0 BORDER=0>SANTA MONICA, Nov. 5 (Noon) --In a trial starved for scandal, the Amber McGrath story has sent the press corps at the O.J. Simpson civil proceedings into a frenzy. Even the court was affected: Testimony was derailed for 90 minutes Tuesday morning as attorney Robert Baker attempted to have the 18-year-old intern barred from the courtroom. When Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki denied the defense request, Baker turned to the Santa Monica Superior Court supervising judge -- also to no avail.</P>

<P>The 18-year-old court intern told <i>USA Today</i> that Simpson flirted with her in the hallway outside the courtroom, making inappropriate gestures and remarks. He allegedly inviting her to a Halloween party at his home. Arriving at court this morning, Simpson vehemently denied the charges, calling her a "liar." Simpson further claimed that the USA Today reporter Jonathan Lovitt, one of the two reporters who wrote the story,  made an inappropriate comment about Amber to him. Lovitt declined comment on Simpson's charges at a lunchtime press conference. He said USA Today will have a follow-up story on Wednesday.
 </P> 
<P>In testimony, criminalist Dennis Fung on redirect examination told the jury that he conducted a presumptive test for blood in Simpson's sink and shower.  Both those tests, Fung said, were positive. However, Simpson's defense attorney Robert Blaiser pointed out in his cross-examination that there were only isolated blood drops in Simpson's house. There was no trail of blood, no large stains.</P>

<P>Fung was also hit hard by defense attorney Robert Blaiser for using shoddy procedures for collecting evidence and record keeping.  Fung admitted that there were erasure marks on his field notes, several measurements were transposed when they were transferred from Fung's notes into a final report, and evidence at the Bundy crime scene were moved before they were collected. Blaiser especially tried to drive home the mistakes in record keeping.</P>

<P>"Mr. Fung, is the level of care used preparing these documents, the same level of care used collecting evidence in this case," Blaiser asked. His question, however, was successfully objected to by the plaintiffs.</P>

<P>Mark Krueger, an amateur photographer who snapped pictures of Simpson at a football game wearing dark gloves similar to those found at the crime scenes, is expected to take the stand this afternoon.</P>

<H2>The Families v. O.J. Simpson</H2>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Narrow Questioning Frustrates The Defense</B></font><BR>
<IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/casefiles/simpson.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=0 BORDER=0>SANTA MONICA, Nov. 5 (Evening) -- Susan Brockbank, a Los Angeles Police Department criminalist, testified about hair and fiber evidence in the afternoon session of the O.J. Simpson civil trial. Jurors also watched a videotaped deposition of Brenda Vemich, a buyer at Bloomingdales, where Nicole Brown Simpson purchased two pairs of Aris Isotoner Light leather gloves.</P>

<P>Court ended fifteen minutes early so jurors could vote. Wednesday morning the plaintiffs plan to read into the record testimony from the criminal trial of witnesses who saw or took photos of Simpson wearing gloves similar to those found at the Bundy and Rockingham crime scenes. The first witness on Wednesday is expected to be Richard Rubin, a former executive at Aris Isotoner and a glove expert.</P>

<P>Amber McGrath, an 18-year-old court intern who told USA Today that Simpson made improper advances toward her in the hallway, was not in court this afternoon. And despite the media swirl, the court says it has no plans to remove her from her internship.</P>

<P>Vemich, whose testimony was played for the jury via a large television, said that Bloomingdales sold Nicole Brown two pairs of Aris leather gloves for $55 each on Dec. 18, 1990. Vemich also identified photos of the gloves found at Bundy and at Simpson's estate as brown Aris leather, sized extra-large--a brand made exclusively for Bloomingdales.</P>

<P>In the deposition, Vemich cleared up a problem that surfaced in her criminal testimony--that the number on the receipt used to denote the particular brand of gloves, which should have been 70263, was actually 70268. The cash register was programmed to accepted only four digits for the order number, Vemich said. The eight was a "check" signifying that the numbers on the receipt were input properly by the cashier.</P>

<P>Plaintiff's attorney John Kelly, who conducted the deposition, showed Vemich a photograph of Simpson providing commentary at a football game wearing a pair of tightly fitting, brown leather gloves. Simpson and a number of courtroom spectators burst into laughter at the picture, which showed Simpson with a wide open mouth and round eyes. Vemich said she could not positively say the gloves were Aris Light.</P>

<P>Brockbank, the LAPD criminalist who handled hair and fiber evidence taken from the Bundy and Rockingham crime scenes, gave a detailed accounting of how the items she handled were catalogued. But the plaintiffs, sticking to their strategy of limiting police witnesses, did not ask Brockbank about any evidence she analyzed or whether it tied Simpson to the murders.</P>

<P>As a result, defense attorney Robert Blaiser was frustrated in his attempts to further indict the police for their mishandling of evidence. However, he alluded to another explanation for rare carpet fibers from Simpson's Bronco being found at the Bundy crime scene, asking Brockbank if the police every tried to determine if his children or their dog could have tracked the fibers there.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Jurors Watch Simpson Try On Gloves</B></font><BR>
<IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/casefiles/simpson.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=0 BORDER=0>SANTA MONICA, Nov. 6 (Noon) -- Jurors in the O.J. Simpson civil trial Wednesday afternoon watched Simpson painstakingly pull latex gloves onto his hands and then try to squeeze on the "bloody gloves." However, the scene was not live, but shown on video from the criminal trial. Still, it was high drama in the silent, darkened courtroom as spectators and jurors leaned forward in their seats and stared intently at the screen.</P>

<P>The video -- shown without sound -- was introduced by the defense during cross-examination of Richard Rubin, a glove expert and former executive at Aris Isotoner. The plaintiffs vehemently tried to keep the video out of court, arguing it was hearsay and that Simpson tried on the gloves under inadequate conditions, but Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki overruled their objections.</P>

<P>In his direct examination, Rubin was on the stand for about an hour, explaining that the Aris Light leather gloves were not made in large quantity and were exclusively manufactured  for Bloomingdales. In 1990, the year Nicole Brown Simpson purchased two pairs of the gloves, Bloomingdales sold between 200 and 240 pairs. John Kelly, who represents the Brown family, took Rubin through 11 photographs and a videotape that showed Simpson wearing dark leather gloves. Each time, Rubin identified the gloves as Aris Light leather. Kelly also asked Rubin if he thought the gloves fit when Simpson tried them on in the criminal trial.</P>

<P>"They fit with a poor quality of fit, but they fit," Rubin said. "They were on inch short in the wrist."</P>

<P>Baker, in his cross-examination, pointed out that most of the photos showed Simpson wearing black gloves. In a few pictures, he was wearing light brown. But the gloves, one of which was found at Simpson's estate and the other at Nicole's Bundy condominium, appear to be dark brown. Baker also emphasized that the gloves were designed to be skin tight.</P>

<P>  Asked Baker: "It's not going to fall off, is it? It's not going to fall off in two different places."</P>

<P>Rubin resumes his testimony this afternoon.</P>

But on cross-examination, the defense tried to show they had been altered, pointing out that Scull sold them to the tabloid National Enquirer, that the negatives left his possession for several days, and they even traveled to London where they were scanned into a computer at a photo laboratory.</P>

<P>Thursday the plaintiffs plan to call via his deposition, Det. Kenneth Berris, the Chicago police officer who inspected Simpson's hotel room, and Dr. Robert Huizenga, who examined Simpson shortly before he was arrested. Thursday afternoon the court has scheduled a hearing outside the presence of the jury to determine whether the plaintiffs can present evidence that shows the personality profile of a person who commits a domestic homicide. </P>

<P> Scull's direct testimony was shown on videotape, but his cross-examination was read into the record. Phil Baker, lead defense attorney Robert Baker's son, sat on the witness stand and pretended he was Scull. Young Baker acted out his testimony to the hilt, making Scull look foolish in a number of instances. The jury, and the audience, laughed several times.</P>

<P> In one of the funnier moments, Scull (played by Baker) was asked  whether he realized that his agent received $17,000 for brokering his picture deal with the National Enquirer, but only paid Scull $2,500.</P>

<P>"No," Baker replied drawing out his answer and acting incredulous.</P>

<P>The defense also noted that Simpson had no astroturf remnants on his shoes and that Scull never told his friends or mother that he had pictures of Simpson wearing shoes purportedly used in the murders.</P>

<P>One interesting fact that also came out in Scull's testimony is that he claims he sent a copy of his picture to Pro Football Weekly, a magazine, shortly after it was taken in September 1993. The editor of the magazine, Scull said, still has the photo.</P>

<P>Earlier in the afternoon, glove expert Richard Rubin finished his testimony. Through his questioning defense attorney Robert Baker tried to show Rubin was biased in favor of the plaintiffs and that he wanted Simpson convicted in the criminal trial. Baker noted that Rubin asked for all the prosecutors' business cards so he could make a display for his office. The defense also introduced into evidence a letter Rubin wrote to the prosecutors after testifying in the criminal trial. Concluding his note, Rubin said: "Maybe I can make it to the victory party!"</P>

<P>Simpson was in court for most of the day, although he came late and left early. His mother, Eunice, sat behind him. Both of Ronald Goldman's parents, Fredric Goldman and Sharon Rufo, attended the proceedings as well.</P>

<H2>The Families v. O.J. Simpson</H2>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Plaintiffs Call Defense Witnesses From Criminal Trial</B></font><BR>
<IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/casefiles/simpson.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=0 BORDER=0>SANTA MONICA, Nov. 7 (Noon) -- Dr. Robert Huizenga took the stand Thursday morning in the O.J. Simpson civil trial, meticulously describing the 11 cuts and abrasions he saw on Simpson's hands three days after the murders took place. Deposition testimony from Kenneth Berris, the Chicago police detective who examined Simpson's hotel room on June 13, 1994, was also read into the record. </P>

<P>Both witnesses testified for the defense in the criminal trial, but they were called by the plaintiffs for the civil proceedings.</P>

<P>Jurors were excused for the day at 10:50 a.m. to allow the judge to hear motions in the afternoon.  Scheduled is a hearing to determine if the plaintiffs can introduce evidence about the profile of a person who commits a domestic homicide. Park Dietz, a nationally known forensic psychiatrist, and Donald Dutton, a domestic violence expert, are expected to testify at the hearing.</P>

<P>Dr. Huizenga examined Simpson twice shortly after the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman, at the behest of criminal defense lawyer Robert Shapiro. The doctor told the jury that during the two examinations -- on June 15 and June 17, 1994 -- Simpson had three small cuts and seven abrasions on his left hand, and one small cut on his right. The plaintiffs asked Huizenga only to note their presence and provide a time frame for when they happened. They did not ask how the cuts might have occurred.</P>

<P>"These injuries had occurred within the last five to seven days," Huizenga said.</P>

<P>"That would include June 12, 1994?" Plaintiffs attorney Daniel Petrocelli asked.
</P> 
<P>"That would be within five to seven days," Huizenga replied.</P>

<P>Chicago Police Detective Kenneth Berris' testimony focused on his search of the hotel room Simpson stayed in the night after the murders. Berris said that he saw red drops, which he called "suspect blood," on the sheets in the middle of the bed and also on pillowcases. He also testified that there was a broken glass in the bathroom sink and chips of glass around the bathroom vanity. But the only blood in the bathroom was a small amount on a face cloth, Berris said. There was no blood on the glass shards, the sink, or the vanity, according to the testimony.</P>

<P>During a short cross-examination, Berris admitted that no tests were done to check for the presence of blood in the bathroom.</P>

<P>Simpson left court abruptly in the middle of Berris' testimony.</P>

<H2>The Families v. O.J. Simpson</H2>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Judge Mulls Domestic Violence Profiling</B></font><BR>
<IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/casefiles/simpson.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=0 BORDER=0>SANTA MONICA, Nov. 7 (Evening) -- Outside the presence of the jury, the plaintiffs Thursday afternoon in the O.J. Simpson civil trial argued that they should be allowed to put on witnesses to offer expert testimony on the profile of a person that would commit a domestic homicide.  Although Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki did not rule on the motion, he indicated that he had serious reservations about allowing the testimony of one of the experts.</P>

<P>Friday court begins at 9:00 a.m. The only scheduled witness is crime scene reconstruction expert and pathologist Werner Spitz. Fujisaki is expected to first hear a defense motion to bar the autopsy photos of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman from being shown to the jury. At the very least, the defense wants to limit the number of photos the plaintiffs can present as evidence. Fujisaki, who briefly took up the question this afternoon, seemed inclined to agree that the plaintiffs should scale down their list of 35 photos.</P>

<P>"I'm concerned that 35 photographs seems somewhat successive," Fujisaki said.</P>

<P>Earlier in the afternoon Dr. Park Dietz, a forensic psychiatrist, and Donald Dutton, a psychologist and expert on spousal homicide took the stand to tell the judge what they would say in their testimony. </P>

<P>Dietz, a nationally known expert, said that he would be able to discern a motive for the murders by studying the evidence from the crime scene and autopsies. Dietz further said he could testify that, assuming Simpson committed the crime, he had a motive.</P>

<P>Dutton, a research psychologist who specializes in spousal violence, testified that he would tell the jury about the factors that can lead to spousal homicide. Those characteristics include: previous violence in the household; jealousy; estrangement; stalking; and threats.</P>

<P>On cross-examination, defense attorney Daniel Leonard pointed out that in the majority of trials where the experts testified, the jury knew the defendant committed the crime -- unlike the Simpson civil trial. "Profiling" is also dangerous, Leonard noted, just ask Olympic bombing suspect, and then non-suspect, Richard Jewell -- who the FBI decided fit the profile of a bomber.</P>

<P>Fujisaki did not rule on the motions this afternoon, but he indicated that he was troubled by the prospect of Park's testimony.</P>

<P>"He's not going to say Simpson did it," plaintiff's attorney Peter Gelblum insisted.</P>

<P>"I think that's essentially what he will say," Fujisaki replied.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Pathologist Takes Court On A Grisly Tour</B></font><BR>
<IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/casefiles/simpson.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=0 BORDER=0>SANTA MONICA, Nov. 8 (Noon) -- The plaintiffs' pathology expert Dr. Werner Spitz Friday morning walked jurors through 14 grisly autopsy photos, showing stab wounds, bruises, and abrasions on the bodies of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman. Both victims died from loss of blood, Spitz said, and their struggle with the assailant was very brief.</P>

<P>Spitz, a forensic pathologist from Michigan, is still testifying on direct examination in the O.J. Simpson civil trial. He is the only scheduled witness for the day.</P>

<P>Spitz's testimony mixed the graphic with folksy. He compared a brain to a bowl of Jello, a wound in Goldman's aorta to a garden hose, and told jurors that epidermis was the same as snake skin. The white-haired doctor had the complete attention of the jury and the packed courtroom.  Most of the jurors took copious notes, leaned forward in their chairs, and appeared more studious than disturbed by the photographs. However, one alternate juror was crying and two jurors grimaced repeatedly.</P>

<P>Before the jurors were brought in, the attorneys haggled about how many of the autopsy photos the jury would be allowed to see. Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki eventually allowed 14 -- one less than the plaintiffs asked for this morning, after they pared down their request from 35. Although the pictures were turned away from the courtroom spectators, they still caused a stir. Frederic Goldman and his daughter Kim cried throughout Spitz's testimony about Ron's wounds; Fred eventually left the courtroom. Simpson, who left the proceedings suddenly Thursday because he was not feeling well, was not in court this morning. Judge Fujisaki also threatened to clear the first row of seats near the jury box because jurors complained they could hear people making comments. </P>

<P>In his testimony, Spitz said that Nicole died from loss of blood after her throat was cut. "There is a slash across the neck, running from left to right, which is the devastating wound," Spitz said, "severing part of the voice box, in other words, cutting the voice box in two, entering the bone of the vertebrae column, and going through the tube from which we swallow -- the so-called esophagus."</P>

<P>Spitz demonstrated on plaintiff attorney Edward Medvene how the assailant delivered the wound -- standing behind Nicole and holding her head back with the left hand somewhere in the middle of her face. Because the assailant was behind Nicole, the assailant would not have been covered in blood. Later, Spitz said the assailant could have held back Nicole's head by pulling on her hair. The attack, Spitz said, was very brief.</P>

<P>"The slashing of the throat was the terminal event and I think the entire scenario of Miss Brown's altercation from the first wound to the last was 15 seconds," Spitz said.</P>

<P>Spitz testified that Ron Goldman was killed by a stab wound to his left flank, which put two holes in his aorta. Goldman also had a cut in his thigh, wounds on his neck, two wounds in the chest, and defensive wounds on his left hand. He, too, died quickly from loss of blood.</P>

<P>"This wound [in the left flank] would have killed Ronald Goldman in short order," Spitz said.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Simpson's Wounds Called 'Gouges' From A Death Struggle</B></font><BR>
<IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/casefiles/simpson.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=0 BORDER=0>SANTA MONICA, Nov. 8 (Evening) -- The plaintiffs' pathology expert Dr. Werner Spitz admitted Friday afternoon on cross-examination that nothing was found under the nails of Goldman and Brown that could link Simpson to the killings.</P>

<P>Spitz had earlier told jurors he believed the wounds on Simpson's fingers were made by fingernail gouges inflicted in a death struggle with Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman. But Spitz told defense lawyer Robert Baker that there wouldn't necessarily be tissue under their nails.</P>

<P>Spitz is scheduled to return Tuesday for more cross-examination. The next scheduled witness is Douglas Deedrick, an FBI hair and fiber expert. who testified at the criminal trial. Monday, Veterans Day, is a court
holiday.</P>

<P>The plaintiffs used a centerpiece from the defense's case in the criminal trial -- a picture of Simpson with his daughter at her dance recital taken just hours before the murders -- to show that Simpson has none of the cuts and bruises that were later found. Simpson has said he cut his hand on the night of the murders at his home when retrieving a car phone and again several hours later in a Chicago hotel room when he broke a glass.</P>

<P>On direct examination, Spitz explained that in the course of the struggle, he thought it likely that one or both of the victims scratched their attacker with their fingernails while trying to escape his hold. Viewing photographs of Simpon's middle finger injury and a second injury, he said, "Both, in my judgment, are fingernail marks."</P>

<P>Calling some of Simpson's finger injuries "gauges", he explained that these weren't caused by broken glass, but by a semi-blunt force. He testified that the superficial scratches on the back of Simpon's left hand could also have been caused by fingernails which "skipped" across Simpson's hand. </P>

<P>Earlier, Dr. Spitz walked jurors through 14 grisly autopsy photos, showing stab wounds, bruises, and abrasions on the bodies of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman. Both victims died from loss of blood, Spitz said, and their struggle with the assailant was very brief.</P>

<P>Most of the jurors took copious notes and leaned forward in their chairs, appearing more studious than disturbed by the photographs. However, one alternate juror was crying and two jurors grimaced repeatedly.</P>

<P>Although the pictures were turned away from the courtroom spectators, they still caused a stir. Fredric Goldman and his daughter Kim cried throughout Spitz's testimony about Ron's wounds; Fred eventually left the courtroom. Simpson, who left the proceedings suddenly Thursday because he was not feeling well, was not in court Friday. </P>

<P>Spitz said that Nicole died from loss of blood after her throat was cut. "There is a slash across the neck, running from left to right, which is the devastating wound," Spitz said.</P>

<P>Spitz demonstrated on plaintiff attorney Edward Medvene how the assailant delivered the wound -- standing behind Nicole and holding her head back with the left hand somewhere in the middle of her face.

<IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/casefiles/simpson.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=0 BORDER=0>SANTA MONICA Nov. 12, (Noon) -- Defense attorney Robert Baker finished a mostly hostile cross examination of pathologist Werner Spitz Tuesday morning in the O.J. Simpson civil trial. Through his questions, Baker worked to cast doubt on Spitz's opinions that Simpson had fingernail marks on his hands, that the two victims briefly struggled with the attacker, and that the assailant would not have been covered in blood.</P>

<P>This afternoon, Spitz will remain on the stand for his redirect examination by plaintiffs lawyer Edward Medvene. The next scheduled witness is Federal Bureau of Investigation hair and fiber expert Douglas Deedrick.</P>

<P>Although Baker constantly mocked and belittled Spitz's testimony, there were a few lighter moments in the courtroom. In one exchange, Baker suggested that Ronald Goldman's fingernails were too short to wound an assailants' hands. Spitz noted that his fingernails were about the same size as Goldman's--and offered to demonstrate on Baker. "Sure, gouge me," Baker replied, rolling up his sleeve.</P>

<P>But Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki refused to let the demonstration take place. "Mr. Baker, I'm not going to have any gauging of flesh out in my courtroom," Fujisaki said.</P>

<P>Baker spent much of his cross-examination trying to show that Spitz was wrong in his conclusion that the struggle lasted more than a minute. Pointing to blood stains on Goldman's pants, Baker noted, that Goldman would have needed to be standing  longer for all the blood to have dripped down.</P>

<P>The defense also tried to point out that an attacker would have suffered a number of bruises after struggling with Goldman and Nicole Brown Simpson. Goldman, Baker noted, had substantial bruises on his body, which likely came during a struggle. While Spitz said the bruises were consistent with hitting something, he could not be sure it was the assailant.</P>

<P>"He wasn't fighting the fence, he was fighting his attacker," Baker said mockingly.</P>

<P>Spitz was asked why there was not more noise at the crime scene during the struggle.</P>

<P>"Somebody would need to explain to me how Nicole Simpson could scream with her throat cut," Spitz said.</P>

<P>O.J. Simpson was not in court today. He is attending his child custody trial in Orange County.</P>

<IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/casefiles/simpson.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=0 BORDER=0>SANTA MONICA, Nov. 12 (Evening) -- FBI hair and fiber expert Douglas Deedrick took the stand Tuesday afternoon in the O.J. Simpson civil trial, telling jurors that hairs on Ronald Goldman's shirt and the knit cap found at the Bundy crime scene matched hairs belonging to Simpson.</P>

<P>Simpson was not in Santa Monica Tuesday because his child custody case began in Orange, Calif. Simpson, Court TV has learned, took the stand on direct examination in the custody case and is set to continue his testimony Wednesday. The proceedings are closed to the public.</P>

<P>In the civil case, Deedrick will still be testifying on direct examination Wednesday morning. After he finishes discussing hair samples, Deedrick will likely turn to the unique fibers from Simpson's Bronco. Those fibers, the plaintiffs say, were found on the knit cap at the Bundy property and on a glove discovered at Simpson's Rockingham estate. Scheduled to follow Deedrick is DNA expert Dr. Robin Cotton.</P>

<P>Twelve hairs matching O.J. Simpson's hair sample were on the knit cap found at the crime scene, Deedrick testified. Nine of those hairs were inside the cap -- leading Deedrick to say that either Simpson wore the hat, or it was worn by a person sharing the same microscopic hair characteristics as Simpson. One hair matching Simpson's was found on Goldman's shirt, along with 35 hairs matching Nicole Brown Simpson's sample. Some of Nicole Simpson's hairs on the shirt were cut, some were broken, and some were pulled out of the scalp, Deedrick said.</P>

<P>Deedrick was careful in his testimony to point out that hairs do not provide an "absolute form of identification." However, he noted that over the course of conducting more than 10,000 examinations, "it's unusual to find hair samples that exhibit the same microscopic characteristics."</P>

<P>At the beginning of Deedrick's examination, Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki expressed frustration over attorney Edward Medvine's plodding and overbroad line of questioning. "We are just shooting in the dark at this point," the judge said. "We don't need a course in hair and fibers." After sustaining several objections from the defense, the judge could be heard muttering, "Jesus," in frustration.</P>

<P>Earlier in the afternoon, pathologist Werner Spitz finished his testimony -- the most contentious to date in the civil trial. On his re-cross examination, Baker continued to hammer away at Spitz who refused to answer what he considered were misleading questions.  Baker, however, refused to let Spitz not answer his questions. In one typical exchange, Baker interrupted Spitz and exclaimed: "I didn't ask you what you said, I asked you a question, sir."</P>

<P>Spitz fought back as well, refusing to be interrupted by Baker, at one point, saying: "Excuse me, you asked me the question, I'd like to answer it."</P>

<IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/casefiles/simpson.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=0 BORDER=0>SANTA MONICA, Nov. 13 (Noon) -- FBI hair and fiber expert Douglas Deedrick remained on the stand Wednesday morning in the O.J. Simpson civil trial, saying that carpet fibers found on the knit cap at the Bundy crime scene and on a glove found at Simpson's Rockingham estate were similar to fibers from Simpson's Bronco. But in a blow to the plaintiffs, Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki refused to allow Deedrick to tell the jury just how rare the Bronco fibers are.</P>

<P>Deedrick's redirect examination will continue this afternoon, followed by DNA expert Dr. Robin Cotton.</P>

<P>Deedrick told the jury only 14,000 Broncos in the nation contained the particular carpet fibers found in Simpson's Bronco. However, Fujisaki decided that the potential prejudice to the defense was too great to allow Deedrick to get any more specific. The plaintiffs had planned to say that only about 200 Broncos with such fibers were registered in Los Angeles.</P>

<P>During his directed testimony, Deedrick linked cashmere fibers found on Ronald Goldman's shirt and the knit cap, to the lining of the two gloves allegedly used in the double murder. Deedrick also discussed blue-black fibers found in three places -- Goldman's shirt, the Rockingham glove, and Simpson's socks. "I saw no differences between them, they could have come from the same source," Deedrick told the jury.</P>

<P>Defense attorney Daniel Leonard ripped Deedrick during his cross-examination, focusing on the FBI agent's objectivity, the subjectiveness of hair and fiber analysis, and on the fact that the fibers could have been transferred during the course of normal interaction between Simpson and his children.  Leonard hammered away at the reliability of hair and fiber analysis, calling it "more of an art than a science."  Leonard also pointed out that Deedrick kept a picture of himself posing with Fredric and Kim Goldman in his office.</P>

<P>Deedrick was also criticized by Leonard for not telling the jury on his direct examination all the information he knew about the crime scene. For instance, there were a number of hairs found on the knit cap at Bundy belonging to dogs and cats that Deedrick never mentioned. Also inside the cap: "Negroid hairs" that were dissimilar to hair belonging to Simpson.</P>

<P>"Mr. Medvene didn't ask you about those?" Leonard said skeptically.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Jurors Receive DNA Lesson</B></font><BR>
<IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/casefiles/simpson.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=0 BORDER=0>SANTA MONICA, Nov. 13 (Evening) -- The plaintiffs turned to DNA evidence Wednesday afternoon as Robin Cotton, laboratory director of Cellmark Diagnostics, took the stand. Cotton gave an hour overview on DNA testing before beginning to discuss the results from her laboratory's tests of blood evidence from the case.</P>

<P>Thursday morning Cotton will continue to testify on direct examination. Gary Sims, a California forensic scientist,  and Renee Montgomery, a criminalist from the California Department of Justice Laboratory, are expected to take the stand after Cotton.</P>

<P>Cotton told the jury that a blood drop near the bodies of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman contained DNA patterns that matched Simpson's  in five locations. According to the Cellmark test, known as an RFLP test, the chance the blood belonged to someone other than Simpson is one in 170 million to one in 1.2 billion. A blood drop found in the foyer of Simpson's Rockingham estate also had the same odds of belonging to Simpson, Cotton said.</P>

<P>The RFLP test "gives the most information you can get" from a DNA test, Cotton told the jury.</P>

<P>Cellmark labs also performed less conclusive DNA tests, known as PCR tests, on several other blood drops found at the Bundy crime scene. The likelihood the blood belonged to someone other than Simpson fell in the range of 1 in 5,200 to 1 in 56,000. Cotton also discussed PCR tests conducted on nail scrapings from Nicole Simpson's hands. The blood on the nails most likely belonged to Nicole Simpson, and there was no evidence of an additional person's blood mixed in, Cotton said.</P>

<P>Before presenting the results of Cellmark's DNA tests, plaintiff's lawyer Thomas Lambert took Cotton through a quick, but dense, description of DNA testing. Almost from the outset Cotton's testimony was mired in a thick, alphabet soup as she talked about TWGDAM guidelines, AT pairs, GC pairs, RFLP tests, PCR tests, and DQ Alpha tests.</P>

<P>Lambert also took a preemptive strike at a probable area of defense attack -- the degradation of the evidence. He asked Cotton to explain the term as it relates to DNA tests.</P>

<P>"Degradation is something you see all the time," Cotton said, comparing a DNA molecule to a long piece of string. If the string is cut 20 times, Cotton explained, it would be slightly degraded. However, it is still possible to conduct tests on DNA that has been degraded. Only the most severely degraded DNA cannot be tested, Cotton said.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Blood Trail Leads To Simpson, DNA Expert Says</B></font><BR>
<IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/casefiles/simpson.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=0 BORDER=0>SANTA MONICA, Nov. 14 (Noon) --Robin Cotton, laboratory director of Cellmark Diagnostics, finished testifying Thursday morning about her company's DNA analysis of blood evidence found at the Bundy crime scene and at Simpson's home.</P>

<P>Scheduled to take the stand this afternoon are California Department of Justice employees Renee Montgomery and Gary Sims. Both performed DNA testing of evidence in the Simpson case.</P>

<P>Cotton told the jury that her lab's testing showed that blood on a sock in Simpson's bedroom matched Nicole Brown Simpson's blood sample. The chance that the blood belonged to another person was one and 6.8 billion or higher, Cotton said. The plaintiffs, as they finished their direct examination, used Cotton to counter the defense theory that blood from Nicole Brown Simpson's reference vial was planted on Simpson's socks. The blood on the socks was rich with DNA, Cotton testified, while Nicole Brown Simpson's reference blood contained "substantially" degraded DNA.</P>

<P>On cross examination, defense lawyer Robert Blasier tried to show that DNA testing is too complicated to produce wholly accurate results. He also pointed to errors Cellmark made in 1988 and 1989, when the lab identified two incorrect matches while testing 99 samples. The 1988 mistake, Blasier said, noted that there was a one in 1.8 billion chance that the blood belonged to another person.</P>

<P>"In these two years on the tests your lab took, you screwed up once every 50 times," Blasier said.</P>

<P>Blasier also sought to show the jury that DNA testing is only as good as the evidence. If the LAPD mishandled the collection and preservation of the evidence, then the test results would not matter. Cotton was also hit by Blasier for the astronomical numbers related to DNA evidence. The numbers are created using a mathematical equation, drawn from a sample size of 200 people. Of the 200-person sample, Blasier pointed out, only two of the people were African American.</P>

<P>Blasier's cross-examination was interrupted by Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki at one point because a juror appeared to be sleeping. "Mr. Blasier, this scintillating examination appears to be having an effect on the jurors," Judge Fujisaki said, calling for a ten-minute recess. After court reconvened, lead defense attorney Robert Baker asked for a sidebar conference. When it ended, Judge Fujisaki apologized to the jury for calling the examination, which he noted was important to the defense's case, scintillating. He also told the jurors to pay attention, not only because the evidence was important, but because all eyes in the courtroom were focused on them.</P>

<P>"If you feel like you concentrate better by closing your eyes, you might want to have some second thoughts about that because everybody's going to think you're dozing off," Judge Fujisaki said.</P>

<P>Simpson was not in court this morning. His custody trial is not in session today.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>More DNA Experts Say The Blood Trail Leads To Simpson</B></font><BR>
<IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/casefiles/simpson.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=0 BORDER=0>SANTA MONICA, Nov. 14 (Evening) -- DNA analysts Renee Montgomery and Gary Sims testified Thursday afternoon in the O.J. Simpson civil trial, telling jurors that blood drops on the back gate at the Bundy crime scene most likely matched Simpson's. </P>

<P>Court will convene Friday at 9:00 a.m. and is expected to last only half a day. Sims, who finished direct examination, is the only scheduled witness tomorrow. On Monday, the plaintiffs plan to call Colin Yamauchi, an LAPD criminalist, and FBI shoe print expert William Bodziack.</P>

<P>Sims, a criminalist supervisor at the California Department of Justice DNA laboratory, talked about  the blood samples collected from the back gate at Bundy by police several weeks after the murders. All  three samples tested by his lab matched the DNA of Simpson. Sims was able to perform the most sensitive DNA test, called RFLP, on one of the samples. The chance of that blood coming from another person besides Simpson, Sims said, was one in 57 billion or more.</P>

<P>Anticipating that the defense will claim the blood on the gate was planted, the plaintiffs had Sims tell jurors that it was possible for blood to remain there for several weeks without degrading.</P>

<P>Plaintiffs attorney Thomas Lambert also launch a preventive strike on defense assertions that the bloody socks found in Simpson's bedroom were planted. When the socks were first recovered, the criminalists did not notice blood on them for a number of weeks, leading the defense to question why blood seemed to suddenly appear weeks later. </P>

<P>After the first blood spots were pointed out to him, Sims said he discovered additional spots on the sock while photographing them under high-powered lighting. After putting them under a microscope, Sims said he found even more blood. When he made those discoveries, Sims testified, Edward Blake, Simpson's criminal defense DNA expert, was present.</P>

<P>Earlier in the afternoon, Montgomery, a criminalist who works for Sims, testified about tests she performed on a number of pieces of blood evidence. Those tests, called D1S80, use a combination of PCR and RFLP techniques. Montgomery identified blood at the Bundy crime scene as Simpson's; blood in Simpson's Bronco as belonging to Simpson, Nicole Brown Simpson, and possibly Ronald Goldman; and blood on the glove allegedly found at Rockingham as belonging to Simpson and Nicole Brown Simpson.</P>

<P>On cross-examination defense attorney Robert Blasier tried to show that the tests conducted by Montgomery were subjective. Montgomery admitted that she needed to make some interpretation to come to her findings. Blasier also pointed out that some of the alleles her test identified as belonging to Nicole Brown Simpson and O.J. Simpson were so common that 30 percent of the population would have one of them.</P>

<P>O.J. Simpson was not in court Thursday because he was with his mother who underwent surgery for a knee replacement this afternoon at a local hospital.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Simpson To Testify</B></font><BR>
<IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/casefiles/simpson.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=0 BORDER=0>SANTA MONICA, Nov. 15 (Evening) -- O.J. Simpson is scheduled to take the witness stand in his civil trial on Friday, Nov. 22. He will testify until Tuesday, Nov. 26, when the court breaks for Thanksgiving. Although Simpson is in the midst of a custody case in Orange, Calif., the judge in that trial agreed to the plaintiffs' lawyers request that Simpson be freed to testify here in Santa Monica.</p>

<P>Simpson's testimony will cap off a week where the plaintiffs plan to present witnesses who are expected to identify the shoes used by the killer as size-12 Bruno Magli; relate various incidents of domestic violence; including Nicole Brown Simpson's now-infamous 911 recording; and discuss Simpson's whereabouts on June 12, 1994. </P>

<P>Before Simpson, scheduled witnesses are: criminalist Collin Yamauchi; FBI shoe print expert William Bodziak; 911 operator Sharon Gilbert; and two LAPD officers and one former officer who responded to domestic violence calls involving the defendant. These witnesses will be followed by Kato Kaelin and limousine driver Allan Park.</P>

<P>In the morning session Friday, Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki dismissed an alternate juror for repeatedly sleeping during the proceedings, Friday morning in the O.J. Simpson civil trial. On the witness stand, DNA analyst Gary Sims finished his testimony about blood evidence in the case.</P>

<P>The dismissed alternate juror is a 19-year-old student. During the voir dire process, she said that Simpson could have been a batterer, but that did not mean he was necessarily a murderer. The young woman is the second alternate juror to be dismissed, leaving six alternates left.</P>

<P>Defense attorney Robert Baker asked for the juror's dismissal after her heavy lids provoked Judge Fujisaki to order a ten-minute recess Thursday and sarcastically call Robert Blasier's cross-examination "scintillating."</P>

<P>During a sidebar conference  after the recess, Judge Fujisaki said that he, too, noticed the alternate sleeping in court. "I am quite troubled with her sleeping through," Fujisaki said. "She seems to have some sort of metabolic problem that causes her to have an inability to stay awake."</P>

<P>Also during the sidebar, both Baker and Petrocelli pointed out that another juror -- the only African American on the 12-member panel -- also snoozed during testimony. Fujisaki said he would "keep a further eye on her." </P>

<P>In testimony during the morning session, defense attorney Blasier sharply questioned Sims about whether blood on the socks from Simpson's room and on the back gate of Bundy could have been planted. Of all the 108 items of evidence analyzed by Sims' lab -- the California Department of Justice DNA laboratory -- the socks and the gate had the most DNA on them, Blasier noted. Yet the blood on both was found, or collected, a number of weeks after the murders. </P>

<P>Blasier also used Sims to counter the plaintiffs theory that Nicole Brown Simpson's blood on the socks could not have been planted because it was richer in DNA than the blood in her sample vial. But Sims noted that DNA degrades in a liquid blood sample faster than it would if it dried on a thin fiber, such as the socks.</P>

<P>Simpson, who has not been in court all week because of his custody trial and his mother's knee surgery, was in court this morning. He left during the 11:00 a.m. break.</P>

<P>Court reconvened for a short time this afternoon so the plaintiffs could read into evidence "requests for admissions"-- the defense's responses to questions posed by plaintiffs' attorneys about whether or not certain facts in the case are true.  Running contrary to their argument that DNA is not an exact science, the defense  agreed that many of the DNA results matched the DNA types of Simpson and the two victims.</P>

<P>Defense admissions included: the blood on the back gate and front walk of the Bundy crime scene matched Simpson's DNA, some of the drops in Simpson's Bronco matched DNA types of Simpson, Ronald Goldman, and Nicole Brown Simpson; and the blood on the sock found in Simpson's bedroom had DNA that matched O.J. Simpson and Nicole Brown Simpson.</P>

<P>By agreeing that the blood testing showed a match, defense lawyers are not giving up their theories that blood might have been planted or contaminated. They are not conceding that his blood was at the crime scene.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Officer Recounts A Domestic Violence Call At Simpson's Home</B></font><BR>
<IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/casefiles/simpson.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=0 BORDER=0>SANTA MONICA, Nov. 18 (Noon) -- Los Angeles Police Department criminalist Collin Yamauchi finished testifying this morning, denying that he could have contaminated evidence in the laboratory. LAPD Det. John Edwards, who responded to a 1989 domestic violence call at Simpson's home, finished the morning session the stand.</P>

<P>Edwards will continue his testimony in the afternoon session. He is scheduled to be followed by the 911 operator who answered Nicole Brown Simpson's call on Jan. 1, 1989 at about 4:00 a.m.</P>

<P>The plaintiffs continued their practice of sharply limiting the direct examination of LAPD employees involved in the double murder investigation. Yamauchi testified on direct for about 35 minutes, describing in detail the procedures he used to analyze the blood evidence. He also made clear that he did not spill any blood from Simpson's sample, which the defense contends could have contaminated blood evidence.</P>

<P>"Did you spill any blood," plaintiffs attorney Thomas Lambert asked.</P>

<P>"No," Yamauchi replied.</P>

<P>But on cross-examination, defense attorney Robert Blasier pointed out that some blood from Simpson's sample vial sprayed onto tissues in Yamauchi's hand and seeped onto the his glove. Yamauchi said he changed gloves right after he opened the vial, although he could not remember where he threw out the gloves and the tissues. Blasier also pointedly asked Yamauchi about why he saw no blood on the socks, allegedly taken from Simpson's bedroom, when he viewed them two separate times. The defense has said the blood may have been planted. But Yamauchi explained that he only took cursory looks at the dark socks before discovering blood using a chemical test.</P>

<P>"I could bring those socks out right now, show everybody in this courtroom those socks, and you wouldn't see any blood on them to this day," Yamauchi said.</P>

<P>Det. John Edwards took the stand after Yamauchi because the plaintiffs have had scheduling trouble with FBI shoe print expert William Bodziak, who will now testify Wednesday. Edwards showed the jury photos of a bruised Nicole Brown Simpson taken at the West Los Angeles police station the night of Jan. 1, 1989.  Edwards explained how Nicole Brown Simpson, wearing only a bra and sweatpants, collapsed in his arms after he responded to her 911 call. "She was cold, wet, and shivering," Edwards said, noting he saw bruises on her forehead, swelling over her right eye, a scratch mark on her cheek, a one-inch cut on her nose, a little bit of blood coming down a space  between her teeth, and a hand print on her neck.</P>

<P>"You guys come out here, you talk to him, you leave," Edwards recalled her saying. "You've been out here eight times, I want him arrested, I want my kids back." </P>

<P>Edwards also told the jury how Simpson came out of the police car and yelled at his former-wife.</P>

<P>"I got two other women," Simpson said, according to Edwards. "I don't want that woman in my bed anymore."</P>

<P>Simpson was not in court this morning. However one of his criminal attornies, Robert Shapiro, was there. His presence spurred a media frenzy, although Shapiro is now a member of the media himself. But the new CBS news legal analyst sat in a seat reserved for guests of the defense. Shapiro explained that all the press seats in the courtroom were taken and the court directed him to sit there. Later in the morning, he sat with the rest of the media.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Judge Bars Fuhrman Testimony</B></font><BR>
<IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/casefiles/simpson.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=0 BORDER=0>SANTA MONICA, Nov. 18 (Evening) -- Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki ruled Monday afternoon that the defense cannot introduce former Det. Mark Fuhrman's criminal trial testimony in O.J. Simpson's civil trial. Although the defense could still call Fuhrman as a witness, it's highly unlikely that he can be forced to testify because he does not live in California.</P>

<P>Domestic violence took center stage this afternoon in the O.J. Simpson civil trial, as jurors listened to Nicole Brown Simpson's quivering voice on a recording of a call she placed to police in 1993. On the stand, two Los Angeles Police Department officers and a former private security guard testified about domestic violence incidents between O.J. Simpson and Nicole Brown Simpson.</P>

<P>Tuesday morning, the plaintiffs will play a tape recording -- clandestinely recorded by a police officer -- of a conversation Simpson had with two officers responding to a domestic violence call in 1993 at Nicole Brown Simpson's house. Robert Lerner, one of the officers who was at the house, will continue his examination. </P>

<P>Due after Lerner: Michael Stevens, an investigator who opened Nicole Brown Simpson's safety deposit box; Brian "Kato" Kaelin; and limousine driver Allan Park. FBI shoe expert William Bodziak is now scheduled to testify Wednesday. He will be followed by Simpson. Although the plaintiffs may be ready for Simpson on Thursday it is unclear whether he would be available to testify until Friday.</P>

<P>In issuing his ruling on Fuhrman, Judge Fujisaki noted that the defense only wanted to call the former detective to discredit him, not to have him offer evidence. The order, delivered from the bench, also prohibits the defense from telling the jury about the former detective's no contest plea to perjury charges. Judge Fujisaki also ruled Monday afternoon that the plaintiffs could not offer witness that would present the profile of a person who commits a domestic homicide. The jury, Judge Fujisaki said, could interpret the evidence on its own.</P>

<P>Jurors heard two tapes of 911 calls in the afternoon session. On the first recording, a 1989 New Year's day altercation, a woman could be heard screaming briefly in the background, but Nicole Brown Simpson never spoke on the tape. The 911 operator who took the call, Sharyn Gilbert, testified this afternoon that she heard a slap before the scream. O.J. Simpson ultimately pleaded no contest to spousal battery charges arising from that incident.</P>

<P>The other 911 recording played in the afternoon session was from a 1993 incident at Nicole Brown Simpson's house at Gretna Green. She begged the operator to hurry the police along. "He's back. He's O.J. Simpson. I think you know his record," she told the dispatcher. Later on the tape, O.J. Simpson could be heard yelling obscenities in the background.</P>

<P>Mark Day, a former private security guard who is now an LAPD officer, testified about another domestic violence episode between the Simpsons -- a 1985 altercation. Day told the jury that he arrived at the Rockingham estate and found a "very upset" Nicole Brown Simpson. The officer also saw a dented Mercedes coupe with the windshield smashed. A baseball bat was lying nearby. O.J. Simpson, Day said, admitted losing his temper and was "demure."</P>

<P>Day did not testify in the criminal trial -- a fact quickly brought up by defense attorney Daniel Leonard on cross-examination. Day handed over the reins as soon as the LAPD arrived. The responding officer, Leonard pointed out, was Mark Fuhrman.</P>

<P>"You're kind of a pinch hitter today, aren't you sir," Leonard asked.</P>

<IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/casefiles/simpson.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=0 BORDER=0>SANTA MONICA, Nov. 19 (Noon) -- A new Brian "Kato" Kaelin took the stand Tuesday saying that the three quick thumps he heard on June 12, 1994 sounded "like someone falling back behind my bedroom wall." Earlier in the morning session, jurors listened to a police officer's secretly recorded tape that caught Nicole Brown Simpson and O.J. Simpson trading accusations about who was responsible for a fight at her house.</P>

<P>Kaelin will continue to testify on cross-examination this afternoon. Allan Park, the limousine driver, is scheduled to follow.</P>

<P>Although some of Kaelin's testimony was similar to his testimony in the criminal trial, a different, more serious person took the stand. With shorter hair and wearing a jacket and tie, Kaelin offered potentially damning testimony against OJ. Simpson without the slightest hesitation. Kaelin, who finished his direct examination shortly before the noon break, discussed his interactions with Simpson the day before, and on the day of, the murders. On June 11, Kaelin told the jury, Simpson asked him to watch a scene involving oral sex in the movie "The World According to Garp."</P>

<P>"He compared it to seeing Nicole giving oral sex at the Gretna Green house to a gentleman named Keith," Kato said.</P>

<P>Kaelin also talked about his numerous interactions with Simpson on June 12, the day of the murders. During the afternoon, Kaelin said Simpson told him that he "would do something with the IRS and Nicole's address that would somehow do financial damage to her." Kato told the jury about the now-infamous McDonald's trip that evening and said Simpson was wearing "a sharp-looking sweatsuit, dark."</P>

<P>The plaintiffs also used Kaelin's testimony to preemptively impeach Simpson, who will take the stand at the end of the week. Kaelin contradicted Simpson's deposition testimony in a number of different areas, all pertaining to Simpson's whereabouts between 9:37 and 11:00 p.m. on June 12. In his deposition, Simpson says he was watching television, walking the dog, and chipping golf balls. Under questioning from lead plaintiffs' attorney Daniel Petrocelli, Kaelin said that Simpson never walked his dog, Chachi. And after returning from McDonald's, Kaelin said he didn't hear any noise outside that sounded like Simpson playing golf. Kaelin also told the jury that he could usually see the light from Simpson's television reflected in his bedroom window, but that night he could not.</P>

<P>Before Kaelin's testified, plaintiff's attorneys introduced the tape during the testimony of LAPD Police office Robert Lerner, who responded to a domestic violence call on Oct. 25, 1993. Lerner's supervisor made the tape, recording his separate conversations with both O.J. Simpson and Nicole Brown Simpson. Although the tape's quality is poor, plaintiffs attorney John Kelly asked Lerner to authenticate several statements by Nicole Brown Simpson, which can be clearly heard. In one, she says, "He gets this animalistic look to him . . . I get scared when he looks like that."</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Kaelin Refuses To Back Down</B></font><BR>
<IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/casefiles/simpson.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=0 BORDER=0>SANTA MONICA, Nov. 19 (Evening) -- Brian "Kato" Kaelin faced an arduous and contentious cross-examination Tuesday afternoon. But he refused to back down from his direct testimony. Also on cross examination, defense attorney Robert Baker revived the specter of racist, rogue cop Mark Fuhrman, suggesting that Fuhrman planted the bloody glove found at Rockingham by throwing it out Kaelin's window.</P>

<P>On Wednesday, limousine driver Allan Park is scheduled to take the stand, followed by FBI shoe print expert William Bodziak.</P>

<P>Some of Kaelin's testimony was beneficial to the defense. He said he never saw cuts on Simpson's hands, even after 11:00 p.m. on the night of the murders. For the most part, Baker sought to portray Kaelin as a well-trained plaintiffs witness, who significantly changed his story from previous testimony. The defense had a lot to work with: for the criminal proceedings Kaelin was interviewed twice by police officers and testified under oath in front of the grand jury, at the pretrial hearing, and at the trial itself. Kaelin also gave an extensive interview for a book and was deposed for the civil trial.</P>

<P>Baker hammered Kaelin for slightly changing his story about the thumps he heard behind his room. In his civil testimony, Kaelin said he heard the thumps between 10:40 and 10:50 p.m. But Baker pointed out that in most of his previous testimony Kaelin said he heard the thumps between 10:40 and 10:45 p.m. Also in his civil testimony, Kaelin said the noise was right behind his bed and caused a vibration on the wall. But Baker noted that Kaelin had located the noise further away in his previous testimony. Kaelin felt compelled to change his story, Baker noted, "after spending hours with Mr. Petrocelli," the lead plaintiffs attorney.</P>

<P>Kaelin, however, refused to back down, saying that he didn't wear a watch on the night of the murders and always gave approximate times when he testified.</P>

<P>Baker did not hesitate to raise Fuhrman's name. Kaelin described how he first encountered Fuhrman the day after the murders. Fuhrman was one of four LAPD officers who woke Kaelin up at six in the morning to question him about the murders. Baker tried to establish that Fuhrman went into Kaelin's bathroom alone and looked around. The bathroom has a window that looks out onto the area where the glove was found.
"The only person in your area, your room, was Mark Fuhrman?" Baker asked Kaelin. "Then he went into the bathroom area and looked around, did he not?"</P>

<P>But Kaelin said he didn't think that was true. On redirect examination, Kaelin testified that there was a screen on the window that night.</P>

<P>Outside the courtroom, excitement continued to build as some of the more notable witnesses from the criminal trial took the stand. Park, the limousine driver, who was waiting to testify, stopped and signed autographs for onlookers, as did Kaelin. Although the infamous house guest refused to speak with reporters, he did manage to say he was glad it was over.</P>

<P>"I'm so relieved," he said.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Limo Driver Takes The Stand</B></font><BR>
<IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/casefiles/simpson.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=0 BORDER=0>SANTA MONICA, Nov. 20 (Noon) -- Limousine driver Allan Park took the stand Wednesday  morning in the O.J. Simpson civil trial, telling jurors that he did not see a Ford Bronco when he arrived at Simpson's home at 10:23 on the night of the murders.</P>

<P>Park will continue testifying on cross-examination this afternoon. He is scheduled to be followed by FBI shoe print expert William Bodziak.</P>

<P>On direct examination Park offered virtually the same timeline testimony he gave in the criminal trial. Park said he arrived at the Rockingham estate at 10:23 p.m., and saw no Bronco parked outside. Because he was early, Park got out of the limousine and smoked a cigarette. At 10:40 p.m., Park pulled the limousine into the driveway, again seeing no Bronco, and rang the call box at the gate several times. No one answered. After calling his boss and mother on his cellular phone, Park saw Kato Kaelin on the property at 10:54. At virtually the same time, Park said, he saw a six foot, African-American wearing "dark pants and a dark top" go into the house. "He was moving quickly," Park said.</P>

<P>Park then rang the buzzer again at 10:57,  and Simpson answered immediately. According to Park, Simpson said: "Sorry, I overslept. I just got out of the shower. I'll be down immediately." </P>

<P>Park also testified about a dark duffel bag laying  toward the back of the driveway. When Kaelin offered to put the bag in the trunk, Simpson would not let him, Park said. "Simpson jumped out and said, 'No, no, that's ok, I'll get the bag. Don't worry, I'll get it,'" Park told the jury. "He moved quickly to get the bag."</P>

<P>Robert Baker, who is currently cross-examining Park, began to chip away at the limousine driver's story by pointing out that the little details in Park's testimony were incorrect. For example, in previous testimony Park identified the Luis Vuitton bag as a Gucci bag, a suit bag as a duffel bag, and said he saw two cars in Simpson's driveway when there was only one. Baker also noted that Park did not notice any blood on Simpson's hands, and that he didn't see any blood in the limousine after Simpson left.</P>

<P>Before the testimony began, Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki ruled that the plaintiffs could not force journalist Lawrence Schiller to turn over a copy of a  tape apparently made by Simpson shortly after the murders. Schiller played part of the tape on national television while promoting his book. Fujisaki said that because Schiller is a reporter he is protected by the state's shield law. "Unfortunately, the weight of the jurisprudence in the United States seems to be against you," Judge Fujisaki told the plaintiffs.</P>

<P>In court, Mary Jo Buttafuoco was a surprise visitor. She stopped to talk with Fredric Goldman, telling him that she understands what it is like being a victim. Simpson former criminal defense attorney Robert Shapiro, working now for CBS News, came to court but couldn;t get in. because all the press seating was filled. After being criticized previously for sitting in seats set aside for the defense, Shapiro took his place with the other reporters who can't get into the courtroom -- across the street from the courthouse, in a double-wide trailer where an audio feed of the proceedings is piped in.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Simpson Pictured In Same Shoes As Killer, Expert Says</B></font><BR>
<IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/casefiles/simpson.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=0 BORDER=0>SANTA MONICA, Nov. 20 (Evening) -- FBI footwear expert William Bodziak said Wednesday afternoon that shoe prints left at the blood at the Bundy crime scene came from a rare brand of size-12 Italian shoes. Bodziak further told jurors that Simpson was wearing that type of shoes -- Bruno Magli -- in a photo taken in 1993 at a professional football game.</P>

<P>On Thursday, Bodziak will continue to testify on cross-examination; no other witnesses are scheduled and court is expected to end early. On Friday, O.J. Simpson will take the stand.</P>

<P>Bodziak painstakingly compared 18 characteristics of Bruno Magli's Lorenzo brand shoes to the pair that Simpson was wearing in the photograph. Jurors had previously seen the picture when the plaintiffs introduced the videotaped deposition of Harry Scull, a freelance photographer who took the picture during a Buffalo Bills, Miami Dolphins football game. Scull sold the picture to the "National Enquirer," and the defense contends it was faked. But Bodziak, looking at the soles, the stitching, the seams, and the curves among other design elements on the shoes, declared that Simpson was indeed wearing Bruno Maglis in the picture.</P>

<P>"Based on all these features combined, I was able to determine the shoe depicted in this photograph on the right foot of Mr. Simpson, is a Bruno Magli Lorenzo shoe," Bodziak said. "In addition, I examined the left shoe [in the photograph]...the left shoe corresponded with the left shoe of this design."</P>

<P>Bodziak gave the jury an extremely detailed lesson in shoe-print examination, even showing jurors how the manufactures in Italy put together a pair of Bruno Maglis. He also described how rare the shoes are: Between 1991 and 1993 only 40 stores in the United States and Puerto Rico sold them. These stores sold 299 pairs of the shoes that Simpson is purportedly wearing in the photo. In other testimony, Bodziak said that he saw only one set of shoe prints at the Bundy crime scene and that there appeared to be imprints from Bruno Magli shoes on the carpet taken from Simpson's Bronco.</P>

<P>Earlier Wednesday afternoon, limousine driver Allan Park finished cross-examination. Defense attorney Robert Baker continued to pound Park about small inconsistencies between what he said during the civil trial and his previous testimony. Baker also pointed out that Park, who was familiar with the sound a Ford Bronco makes, never head the car pull up to the house. The defense also tried to make the point that the six foot, African American wearing dark clothes that Park said he saw entering the Rockingham house might have been Simpson in a bathrobe.</P>

<P>On Park's redirect examination, lead plaintiff's attorney Daniel Petrocelli tried to say that the limousine driver had no stake in the case -- an impartial witness simply trying to tell the truth. And happening into a case like the Simpson trial, is not easy, Petrocelli noted.</P>

<P>How much did you get that night for all your trouble?" Petrocelli asked.</P>

<P>"Probably about forty dollars," Park replied as the courtroom spectators broke out in laughter.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Judge Says Simpson Must Testify Friday</B></font><BR>
<IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/casefiles/simpson.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=0 BORDER=0>SANTA MONICA, Nov. 21 (Evening) -- After an abbreviated day in court, plaintiffs attorneys hunkered down to prepare for their most important witness -- O.J. Simpson. Although Simpson's lawyers made a last-minute attempt this morning to delay his testimony, the ex-football star will take the stand Friday morning.</P>

<P>Before the jury came into the courtroom, lead defense attorney Robert Baker asked Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki to reschedule Simpson's testimony until Monday because of strain from his custody trial. "Let Mr. Simpson get his head on straight before these lawyers start attacking him," Baker asked the judge. But Fujisaki denied the request.</P>

<P>The crowds have yet to gather outside the courthouse -- a steady rain has kept onlookers away. But there is certainly a sense of anticipation here, as hordes of reporters arrive and begin to set up for tomorrow. Television crews are building platforms, installing lights, and constructing sets for their anchors. Inside the courtroom, guards this morning were stricter than usual, forbidding reporters and spectators from milling around in the back of the room.</P>

<P>While Simpson's testimony is drawing world-wide attention, what he says will ultimately be weighed by only 12 people. And there is little doubt that Simpson's words will be the focal point of the entire trial. </P>

<P>"This is the single most important piece of evidence in the trial," says Paul Rothstein, who teaches civil and criminal litigation at Georgetown University's law school in Washington, D.C. "The jury will make up its mind on his testimony,"</P>

<P>Although Daniel Petrocelli, who represents Fredric Goldman, will take the lead in examining Simpson, the Brown's lawyer, John Kelly, and Sharon Rufo's lawyer, Michael Brewer, will conduct some of the questioning. Because Simpson was acquitted in his criminal case, he cannot invoke his Fifth Amendment right not to answer questions.</P>

<P>Simpson's testimony presents a number of strategic considerations for the plaintiffs attorneys, who are calling him as their witness even though he is an adverse party to their case. In reality, the plaintiffs examination will be a cross-examination. Simpson will automatically be declared a hostile witness, which will allow the plaintiffs to ask him leading questions. Leading questions give the effect of an attorney testifying for the witness, and they usually require a yes-or-no answer. For example, the plaintiffs could say: "You were in a rage that night, Mr. Simpson, isn't that correct?"</P>

<P>Legal analysts say the plaintiffs must carefully determine the scope of their questioning. Limiting the scope will hinder defense lawyers because they can only cross-examine Simpson on what he has been asked by the plaintiffs. Simpson was deposed earlier this year for ten days. The depositions allow the plaintiffs to impeach Simpson every time he strays from his story. They also give the plaintiffs a map for their examination at trial. The plaintiffs presumably now know which questions upset Simpson and which questions he is adept at answering. The plaintiffs also must avoid asking Simpson broad questions, thus giving him an opportunity to make long speeches and befriend the jury. Simpson -- a sports hero, celebrity and corporate spokesman -- has a knack for being charming.</P>

<P>"I would try to combat that charisma by trying to ask some things that he's going to get agitated about and lose his cool," says Rothstein.</P>

<P>Much of the plaintiffs examination is expected to focus on questions that go to Simpson's credibility. His alibi has mostly stayed consistent. But the plaintiffs have presented a number of witnesses who contradict Simpson's story. For example, Simpson said in his deposition that on the night of the murders he walked the dog, chipped golf balls, and watched television. But Brian " Kato" Kaelin told jurors that Simpson never walked the dog. Kaelin also testified that he normally could see a reflection in the window from Simpson's television, but he did not see one the night of the murders. Another inconsistency: Limousine driver Allan Park said on the stand that Simpson claimed to have overslept for the trip to the airport. Simpson denies that.</P>

<P>Simpson will also be interrogated about his actions the entire day of the murder. The time period between about 9:30 and 11:00 p.m. -- when Simpson claims to have been alone -- will likely be the most scrutinized.</P>

<P>Expect very detailed questions on the cuts on Simpson hand. Before he left for the airport, Simpson claims he saw some blood on his finger. He told police that his hands were often bleeding, and he might have reopened a cut by handling his cellular phone. The morning after the murders, in his Chicago hotel room, Simpson says he cut his finger again after police called to tell him his wife had been killed and he broke a glass in the bathroom.</P>

<P>The plaintiffs have already laid the groundwork to question Simpson about domestic violence -- but they are likely to proceed cautiously. In opening statements, Petrocelli described Simpson's intense jealousy and need to control his wife. The plaintiffs also introduced photos of a bruised Nicole Brown Simpson and presented testimony about three separate occasions when police were called to settle disputes between the couple. But this line of questioning could give Simpson the opportunity, on cross-examination, to cast blame on Nicole Brown Simpson's alleged drug use and sexual promiscuity. Simpson denies ever beating his former wife, claiming that she beat him.</P>

<P>The plaintiffs' attorneys also have to decide how to approach the witness. Do they come out swinging, or carefully and methodically elicit his testimony? Experts say the plaintiffs need to work slowly, and feel Simpson out on the stand a little before hitting him hard. </P>

<P>"My first instinct would be to start to lull him, because I don't think he is the sharpest tool in the shed," says Barbara Allen Babcock, a former assistant attorney general in the Justice Department's civil division. "Ask him a lot of questions that don't seem to be going anywhere . . . little details, nothing really emotional, and nothing chronological for the first two or three hours."</P>

<P>In the trial this morning, the only testimony came from FBI footwear expert William Bodziak, who was cross-examined by Phil Baker -- lead defense attorney Robert Baker's son. Young Baker used his questioning of Bodziak to make several points: that the bloody shoe prints show that the attack took longer than the plaintiffs say because it took time for the blood to gather into a pool; that members of the Los Angeles police and the FBI went to all 40 stores in the United States that sell Bruno Magli shoes, but never found a receipt that showed Simpson purchased a pair; and that Bodziak was unable to identify more than 20 footprints at the crime scene as Bruno Maglis -- suggesting that there could have been two people at the murders.</P>

<IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/casefiles/simpson.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=0 BORDER=0>SANTA MONICA Nov. 22 (10:30 A.M.) -- O.J. Simpson took the stand about 9:20 am in his civil trial here, answering questions about his relationship with Nicole Brown and about domestic violence.</P>

<P>Daniel Petrocelli is conducting the examination, began by asking Simpson when he met Nicole. She was an 18-year-old waitress, Simpson said and he was 29, a pro football player who was married at the time.</P>

<P>"It was a passionate relationship. . . . true?" Petrocelli asked.</P>

<P>"Yes," Simpson said.</P>

<P>Petrocelli: "And it was a problem relationship . . . true?"</P>

<P>Simpson: "Not true."</P>

<P>Petrocelli quickly turned to the 1989 New Years day domestic violence incident, showing pictures of Nicole Brown Simpson's bruised and battered face.</P>

<P>"How many times did you hit Nicole?" Petrocelli asked.</P>

<P>Simpson: "Never."</P>

<P>"How many times did you strike Nicole?"</P>

<P>Simpson: "Never."</P>

<P>Petrocelli: "How many times did you slap Nicole?"</P>
<P>Simpson: "Never."</P>

<P>At one point, Simpson, who described the incident as a "wrassling match" offered to wrassle Petrocelli. Petrocelli agreed, asking Simpson to put him in a headlock, like Simpson did to his wife. Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki refused to allow the demonstration.</P>

<P>Simpson did not lose his cool and the stand, answering questions methodically.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Plaintiffs Confront Simpson With Allegations Of Domestic Violence</B></font><BR>
<IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/casefiles/simpson.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=0 BORDER=0>SANTA MONICA, Nov. 22 (Noon) -- O.J. Simpson, testifying at his civil trial here Friday morning, answered questions about his relationship with Nicole Brown Simpson and denied ever hitting her. Plaintiffs lead attorney Daniel Petrocelli, began his examination of Simpson by focusing on the history of their relationship, before turning to specific altercations between the two.</P>

<P>The first question: "When you first met Nicole she was 18 years old, right?"</P>

<P>A crowd of about 100 onlookers and protesters greeted Simpson when he arrived shortly before 9:00 a.m. Whistles, cheers, and boos erupted from the crowd as Simpson got out of his car and entered the courthouse. The former football star's supporters chanted: "Go Juice, go," while his detractors shouted, "Murderer." Close to 200 people lined up for a chance to win one of 16 courtroom seats reserved for the public. The court hands out the seats via lottery.</P>

<P>Petrocelli's questions have not been very contentious, and Simpson has maintained his calm throughout the examination. Simpson has had some trouble answering questions with a simple yes or no. Several of his comments have been stricken from the record for being non-responsive to the question.</P>

<P>The plaintiffs opening questions went through the chronology of Simpson's relationship with his ex-wife. Petrocelli tried to suggest that Simpson was much older and more worldly than Nicole, and that they had a passionate, but troubled relationship.</P>

<P>"During that time there were some good times and bad times?" Petrocelli asked.</P>

<P>"Mostly good," Simpson replied. He added later: "Yes, we had problems in our relationship, but I don't think it was mostly a problem relationship."</P>

<P>Petrocelli next turned to specific domestic violence incidents, focusing mainly on the 1989 episode when Simpson pleaded no contest to spousal battery charges. Simpson said he never hit Nicole, although he admitted the two "wrassled." Petrocelli showed photographs the police took of a battered and bruised Nicole Brown Simpson, and asked O.J. Simpson to explain exactly how he caused specific injuries on her face. Simpson said he did not know, but that he felt "totally responsible for every injury she had."</P>

<P>Said Simpson: "I did not punch her or slap her -- it didn't happen."</P>

<P>The plaintiffs also asked Simpson detailed questions about the incident when he smashed the window of her Mercedes and an altercation at Nicole Brown Simpson's Gretna Green home. The altercation occurred after Simpson spied on Nicole Brown Simpson through her window and watching her performing oral sex on a boyfriend. Simpson said he watched for about 10 seconds and was "pretty stunned."</P>

<P>Petrocelli then asked about the couple's attempt reconciliation and eventual brake up. </P>

<P>"She was incessably [sic] pursuing me," Simpson said. "I think everyone, including her family, knows it was her pursuing me."</P>

<P>The couple broke off their reconciliation on May 10, 1994, Simpson said, and he began to date Paula Barbieri almost immediately. But Petrocelli pointed out that Simpson purchased Nicole an expensive emerald bracelet on May 19 for her birthday. He also asked Simpson about notes Nicole made shortly before her death that say the two ended their relationship an May 22. </P>

<P>"I think Nicole may have accepted it then," Simpson said.</P>

<P>In court during the morning session were: Kim and Fred Goldman; Lou and Juditha Brown; Denise Brown; Sharon Rufo, Ronald Goldman's mother, and Simpson's sister Shirley Baker and her husband. Inside the audio trailer were Simpson authors: Jeffrey Toobin and Vincent Bugliosi, as well as Simpson criminal lawyer Robert Shapiro, who is working as a CBS news commentator.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Simpson Explains Reporting His Ex-Wife To The IRS</B></font><BR>
<IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/casefiles/simpson.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=0 BORDER=0>SANTA MONICA, Nov. 22. (2:40 P.M.) -- On the witness stand in his civil trial, O.J. Simpson is just starting to answer questions about what he was doing on June 12, 1994, the day Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman were murdered. Plaintiffs attorney Daniel Petrocelli has been suggesting that Simpson was extremely upset that Nicole Brown Simpson had ended their relationship. Simpson denies it.</P>

<P>Petrocelli began the afternoon session Friday by asking Simpson about the letter he sent to his ex-wife telling her she could not use his Rockingham house as her permanent address -- setting her up for a $100,000 tax liability to the IRS.</P>

<P>"You knew that she had tax problems because Bundy was her residence," but the IRS had it listed as Rockingham, Petrocelli asked.</P>

<P>"I just knew I would have a problem if she got caught doing what she was doing," Simpson said.</P>

<P>Petrocelli alleged the letter was Simpson's attempt to make her move back in with him.</P>

<P>"This letter could have forced her to come back to you, correct?" Petrocelli asked.</P>

<P>Simpson replied: "That is absolutely false."</P>

<P>Petrocelli also read excerpts from his former wife's diary from June 3, 1994 -- three days before Simpson sent the letter.</P>

<P>Nicole wrote in her diary that she and Simpson had a fight that night and quoted him as saying, "You hung up on me, you're going to pay for this bitch . . . They'll get you for tax evasion, I'll see to it bitch."</P>

<P>Simpson denied making that statement.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Simpson Denies He's A Killer</B></font><BR>
<IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/casefiles/simpson.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=0 BORDER=0>SANTA MONICA, Nov. 22 (Evening) -- O.J. Simpson looked over to the jury and told them it is "absolutely not true" that he killed Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman, in a dramatic finish to his first day of testimony in his civil trial.</P>

<P>Plaintiffs' attorney Daniel Petrocelli did his best to take advantage of the dramatic moment, timing his questioning to coincide with the end of the day.</P>

<P>"Now, between 9:35 p.m. and 10:35 p.m. on June 12, there is not a single living human being you can identify that saw or spoke to you, is that true?" Petrocelli asked.</P>

<P>"That is absolutely true," Simpson replied.</P>

<P>Next, the plaintiffs' attorney made his accusations.</P>

<P>"You had gloves, you had a hat, you were wearing a dark sweat outfit, and you had a knife," Petrocelli said to Simpson. "You went to Nicole's condo."</P>

<P>Simpson, looking over at the jurors, replied: "That is absolutely not true."</P>

<P>"And you confronted Nicole Brown Simpson and you killed her, didn't you?" Petrocelli asked.</P>

<P>"That is absolutely not true," Simpson said.</P>

<P>"And you killed Ron Goldman did you not?" Petrocelli continued.</P>

<P>Once again, Simpson replied, "That is absolutely not true."</P>

<P>Petrocelli led up to his conclusion by trying to suggest that Simpson's life in the days leading up to the murders was in turmoil, and his relationships were spinning out of control. Several times, Petrocelli pointed out that Simpson and his ex-wife were not on good terms at that time.</P>

<P>"Is it fair to say in the weeks leading up to the murder, there was zero conversation between you and Nicole?" Petrocelli asked.</P>

<P>"Well, other than the dogs and the kids," Simpson agreed.</P>

<P>On the morning of the murders, Simpson testified that he had a heated fight with one of his golfing buddies. Simpson's girlfriend Paula Barbieri broke up with him by leaving a message on his voicemail, Petrocelli said. The night before, Simpson and Barbieri had a fight, Petrocelli claimed, because Simpson did not want to take her to his daughter's dance recital because Nicole would be there.</P>

<P>"She left you that message because you and she had fought over Nicole once again, true or untrue?" Petrocelli asked.</P>

<P>"Absolutely untrue," Simpson said.</P>

<P>In fact, Simpson said he did not even listen to Barbieri's phone message that day. But Petrocelli produced subpoenaed phone records that showed Simpson called his answering service for five minutes at 6:56 that evening and later left Barbieri a message asking why she was so upset. Simpson also admitted making a phone call that evening to a Playboy model Kato Kaelin was introducing him to, and another model. Petrocelli asked if He left a message that said: " Hi, it's O.J., I'm unattached for the first time in my life." Simpson agreed.</P>

<P>The last call Simpson made before the murders was to Nicole's Bundy condominium, the phone records showed. Simpson said it was to congratulate his daughter -- a fact Petrocelli found hard to believe, pointing out that he had just seen her two and a half hours earlier.</P>

<P>Petrocelli also introduced a picture taken at the dance recital, which showed Simpson's left hand.</P>

<P>"Now see your left hand there?" Petrocelli asked. "No cuts at all on that left hand, it's about 6:15, 6:30 p.m.?" Simpson agreed.</P>

<P>Following the recital, Petrocelli took Simpson through a detailed account of his trip to McDonald's with houseguest Brian "Kato" Kaelin -- trying to show that Simpson really did not want him along.</P>

<P>"Why didn't you tell Kato where you were going?" Petrocelli asked.</P>

<P>"I didn't have a date with Kato, I was going to get a burger," Simpson said with a chuckle.</P>

<P>The laughter was too much for the plaintiffs' lawyer, who jumped on Simpson for making light of such a serious issue.</P>

<P>Said Simpson: "I don't think any of this is funny, I wish I was anywhere but here."</P>

<P>Simpson testimony continues Monday.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Simpson's Alibi Under Attack</B></font><BR>
<IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/casefiles/simpson.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=0 BORDER=0>SANTA MONICA, Nov. 25 (9:50 A.M. COURT BREAK) -- O.J. Simpson faced hostile questioning about inconsistencies in his alibi as he took the stand for day two of his testimony in the civil trial Monday morning.</P>

<P>From the beginning, plaintiffs' attorney Daniel Petrocelli hammered Simpson for testifying Friday that he never picked up a message from his girlfriend Paula Barbieri the night of the murders -- even though his cell phone records show that he did. Simpson also told police he picked up the message. However, Simpson continued to maintain that he did not.</P>

<P>"The truth of the matter, sir, is that you were desperate to get in touch with Paula because she had left you, true?" Petrocelli asked.</P>

<P>"False," Simpson replied.</P>

<P>"The reason you were trying to get in touch with her is because you were feeling alone, true?" Petrocelli asked.</P>

<P>"Not true," Simpson replied.</P>

<P>"You blamed Nicole for feeling alone, didn't you?" Petrocelli asked.</P>

<P>"No," Simpson said.</P>

<P>Petrocelli pointed out that Simpson told the police in his June 13 interview that he called Paula that night from his Bronco. Cellular phone records show a call to her at 10:03 p.m. However, Simpson said he mistakenly told police June 13 that he was in his car. Rather, Simpson said Monday, he called Barbieri from his driveway.</P>

<P>If Simpson called Barbieri from the Bronco at 10:03 that night, Petrocelli said, "that destroys your alibi."</P>

<P>"You were calling Paula at 10:03 while you were driving to Bundy, true?" Petrocelli asked.</P>

<P>Simpson replied: "Untrue."</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>The Blood And The Cuts</B></font><BR>
<IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/casefiles/simpson.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=0 BORDER=0>SANTA MONICA, Nov. 25 (11:10 A.M. COURT BREAK) -- O.J. Simpson, on the stand for the second day in his civil trial, is answering questions about blood found at his house and how he cut his hand the night of the murders. </P>

<P>Simpson said he does not remember how he received the cuts, just that he saw spots of blood on his pinky finger and near his kitchen sink.</P>

<P>"I assumed, because I saw blood on my pinky, I assumed that I cut my hand," Simpson said.</P>

<P>"You have no idea how blood got on you that night, is that what you're saying?" Petrocelli asked.</P>

<P>"Yes," Simpson replied.</P>

<P>Petrocelli also sharply questioned Simpson about the bag he took to the airport, which Kato Kaelin and Allan Park testified that Simpson would not let them touch. Simpson has identified a blue duffel bag as that bag. He said he put it into his golf bag when he reached the airport.</P>

<P>"You're sure that this bag wasn't acquired by someone after the fact to substitute for another bag that has never been seen?" Petrocelli asked.</P>

<P>"I would think not . . . I wouldn't know anyone who would do that." Simpson said.</P>

<P>"Even if they were on trial for their life?" Petrocelli asked, although the judge sustained an objection to the question.</P>

<P>"I noticed a little hesitation in your voice, are you sure that's the bag?" Petrocelli asked.</P>

<P>"It looks like the bag," Simpson replied.</P>

<P>Petrocelli's questioning has at times been so hostile that Simpson's defense attorney Robert Baker objected and asked Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki to require Petrocelli to move back and stop pointing his finger at Simpson.</P>

<P>"Overruled," Judge Fujisaki said. "You've done the same thing with other witnesses, Mr. Baker."</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Simpson Recalls Returning From Chicago With Only One Cut</B></font><BR>
<IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/casefiles/simpson.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=0 BORDER=0>SANTA MONICA, Nov. 25 (Noon) -- O.J. Simpson faced a caustic and hostile examination about cuts on his left hand and blood drops left at his house, as he testified Monday morning in his civil trial.</P>

<P>Plaintiffs' attorney Daniel Petrocelli, at times sarcastic, at times incredulous, pointedly asked Simpson to explain how he received a number of different cuts and scratches on his left hand. Simpson maintained that he had only one cut on his hand when he returned from Chicago, but photos taken by Dr. Robert Huizenga, who examined him two days later, show three cuts and seven abrasions. Simpson testified that he could not remember how he got the other cuts on his hand.</P>

<P>Petrocelli's examination was not friendly.</P>

<P>"Where did you get that fingernail gouge?" Petrocelli asked Simpson, about a small mark on his left hand. Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki sustained a defense objection to the question.</P>

<P>But earlier in his testimony, Simpson implied that some of the injuries on his hand could have been fingernail marks -- from his young son Justin.</P>

<P>Referring to a cut on Simpson's hand, displayed on a photograph, Petrocelli asked, "It was someone's fingernail ripping into you're skin, right?"</P>

<P>"Unless it was Justin's, no," Simpson replied. He added that he was not saying the cut was a fingernail mark, but that he had wrestled with his son after the murders and might have received a mark.</P>

<P>Throughout his testimony Monday, Simpson maintained that he did not know how he cut his hand -- either at Rockingham or in his Chicago hotel room. Before he left for the airport, Simpson said, he "assumed" his hand was cut because he saw blood on the sink and on his pinkie finger. And Simpson testified that he cut his hand on a broken glass in his hotel room, but could not remember exactly how.</P>

<P>"I sustained that injury . . . when I was cleaning the glass, trying to get it into the sink, that's where I got that injury."</P>

<P>Petrocelli also focused his questions on how Simpson's blood ended up his Bronco. Simpson told the jury that he went to the Bronco right before he went to the airport in order to grab his cellular phone accessories and a windbreaker, but didn't notice that he was bleeding. Petrocelli suggested that the right-handed Simpson would have reached into the Bronco with his right hand -- which did not square with having blood from his left hand in the car.</P>

<P>"You have no explanation for how DNA matching your DNA was found in that Bronco, correct?" Petrocelli asked.</P>

<P>"That's correct," Simpson said.</P>

<P>"And you have no explanation for how the blood of Nicole ended up on the driver's side carpet?"</P>

<P>"No," Simpson replied.</P>

<P>"You have no explanation for Ron Goldman's blood was found in that car?" Petrocelli asked.</P>

<P>"No," Simpson replied.</P>

<P>Outside the courthouse, the crowds shouted at Simpson as he arrived for the morning session, and as he left for lunch. The football hero's supporters and detractors each tried to drown the other out. Screams of "Murder," and "Butcher," competed with a chant of: "O.J., O.J., O.J."</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Simpson Denies Taking A Lie Detector Test</B></font><BR>
<IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/casefiles/simpson.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=0 BORDER=0>SANTA MONICA, CALIF. (2:30 P.M. COURT BREAK) -- O.J. Simpson admitted to being hooked up to a polygraph, but said he was just having the lie detector test explained to him, in his testimony Monday afternoon in his civil trial.</P>

<P>After about a 10-minute sidebar conference, Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki, allowed plaintiffs' attorney Daniel Petrocelli to ask questions about the test.</P>

<P>"You went to the office of some person on Wilshire Blvd., and you were wired up for a lie detector test, true?" Petrocelli asked.</P>

<P>"Not true in totality," Simpson replied. "We didn't take a lie detector test, he was explaining it . . . "</P>

<P>"And they asked you questions about Nicole's death and whether you were responsible for it?" Petrocelli asked.</P>

<P>"I don't know if it went that far," Simpson replied after a pause.</P>

<P>"And at the end of that process you scored a minus 22?" Petrocelli asked. </P>

<P>"I don't know what the end result was," Simpson said, later adding: "I understood that once I finished and I understood it, I was willing to do one for the police."</P>

<P>Petrocelli, several questions later, said: "And minus 22, by the way, is a score indicating extreme deception, true?" The judge sustained an objection to the question.</P>

<P>The plaintiffs' lawyer then pointed out that Simpson said in his deposition that he never took a lie detector test. And Simpson stuck by that story.</P>

<P>"As far as I know, I didn't take a polygraph test," Simpson said.</P>

<P>"You did sit for that test, didn't you?" Petrocelli asked.</P>

<P>"That's incorrect," Simpson replied.</P>

<P>After the break, Simpson will answer questions about his flight from police and the low-speed Bronco chase.</P>

<IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/casefiles/simpson.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=0 BORDER=0>SANTA MONICA, Nov. 25 (3:30 COURT BREAK) -- O.J. Simpson, on the stand in his civil trial, said Monday afternoon he believed the photograph of him wearing Bruno Magli shoes was fake.</P>

<P>"My opinion is that it is a fraud," Simpson said. Although he admitted to not being a photography expert, Simpson said previous experience shows him that fraud is possible.</P>

<P>"I saw a picture of Mark Fuhrman and I playing golf together, and I've never played golf with him," Simpson said.</P>

<P>Daniel Petrocelli, who is conducting the examination, also questioned Simpson about whether or not he owned a dark sweatsuit. Simpson testified that he did not, even though Petrocelli produced a photograph of Simpson wearing a dark sweat suit while making a Playboy exercise video at the end of May, 1994. Though Petrocelli hinted that a wardrobe employee from the video shoot will say Simpson did not return the clothes, Simpson says he did.</P>

<P>Earlier, Simpson was unable to say whether he owned a pair of Aris Leather Light gloves, extra-large. But he did say Nicole Brown Simpson did not give him any as presents.</P>

<P>"And she bought you some gloves from time to time, is that true?" Petrocelli asked.</P>

<P>Replied Simpson: "Never." </P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Petrocelli Leads Simpson Through The Bronco Chase</B></font><BR>
<IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/casefiles/simpson.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=0 BORDER=0>SANTA MONICA, Nov. 25 (Evening) -- O.J. Simpson again denied killing Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman Monday afternoon in the civil trial, as plaintiffs' attorney Daniel Petrocelli took Simpson through his suicide note, his low-speed chase with police, and ended his examination with a rhetorical flourish.</P>

<P>After court was let out for the day, a sitting juror, not an alternate, was dismissed. An attorney close to the case said it was woman juror, but would provide no other information.  Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki is expected to make the announcement of the dismissal Tuesday morning, when Simpson's testimony resumes.</P>

<P>While many of the plaintiffs' questions focused on Nicole Brown Simpson, Petrocelli, who represents Fredric Goldman, finished up talking about his client's son.</P>

<P>"Ron Goldman came upon you when you were there with Nicole, and you did not expect him that night, correct?" Petrocelli asked.</P>

<P>"I did not know Ron Goldman . . . " Simpson replied.</P>

<P>"And you left him there to die, Mr. Simpson, with his eyes open looking right at you, true or untrue?" Petrocelli continued.</P>

<P>"That is untrue," Simpson replied.</P>

<P>"I have no further questions for you," Petrocelli said.</P>

<P>Earlier in the afternoon, Fujisaki allowed Petrocelli to introduce evidence about a lie detector test Simpson took shortly after the murders. While lie detector tests are not admissible in criminal cases, California civil law is ambiguous on the subject. Although Fujisaki did not explain his ruling in open court, in a ten-minute sidebar he agreed with Petrocelli's argument that defense attorney Robert Baker opened the door for the plaintiffs when he mentioned in his opening statement Simpson's offer to take a lie detector test after the murders.</P>

<P>When testimony resumed, Petrocelli asked, "You went to the office of some person on Wilshire Blvd., and you were wired up for a lie detector test, true?"</P>

<P>"Not true in totality," Simpson replied. "We didn't take a lie detector test, he was explaining it . . . "</P>

<P>"And they asked you questions about Nicole's death and whether you were responsible for it?" Petrocelli asked.</P>

<P>"I don't know if it went that far," Simpson replied after a pause.</P>

<P>"And at the end of that process you scored a minus 22?" Petrocelli asked. </P>

<P>"I don't know what the end result was," Simpson said, later adding: "I understood that once I finished and I understood it, I was willing to do one for the police."</P>

<P>Petrocelli, several questions later said: "And minus 22, by the way, is a score indicating extreme deception, true?" The judge sustained a defense objection to the question. </P>

<P>The plaintiffs took Simpson through much of the physical evidence in the case -- the gloves; the hat; the blood drops at Bundy and Rockingham; the blood in the Bronco and  on the socks; and the cuts on his hands.</P>

<P>Simpson told jurors that he did not know why his blood was at the crime scene or why the victims' blood was in his Bronco. He said he owned similar gloves, but noted that he owned many pairs of gloves.</P>

<P>The slow-speed Bronco chase also figured prominently in Petrocelli's questioning Monday afternoon.</P>

<P>"You decided that rather than submit to arrest, you would flee, correct?" Petrocelli asked.</P>

<P>"I decided to go to Nicole's grave, correct," Simpson replied.</P>

<P>The plaintiffs' attorney also had Simpson verify what he took with him in his black bag when he fled arrest, including, Petrocelli said, a gun, a passport, a goatee and mustache, and keys to his ex-wife's condominium.</P>

<P>"You also had a key to Nicole's condominium, is that correct?" Petrocelli asked.</P>

<P>"I'm not aware of that," Simpson testified, although he said he had key rings in the bag.</P>

<P>"It had the disguise in there, right?" Petrocelli asked.</P>

<P>"It had the mustache and goatee, yes," Simpson said.</P>

<P>Petrocelli used the chase to present evidence of Simpson's consciousness of guilt. While Simpson was in the Bronco, Petrocelli pointed out, he was on the phone with Det. Tom Lange, whom the defense contends planted evidence in the case. Lange was trying to talk Simpson out of killing himself.</P>

<P>In the heat of the chase, Petrocielli  noted that Simpson thanks Lange over the cellular phone -- saying "I know you are doing your job"  Never in that conversation did Simpson accuse Lange of misconduct. "At no time were you saying, 'Why have you planted all this evidence against me?'" Petrocelli asked.</P>

<P>"I had no idea what the evidence was," Simpson said.</P>

<P>Several questions later, Petrocelli asked, "And the reason you didn't do so is because you knew you committed those murders, correct?"</P>

<P>"That is not correct," Simpson replied.</P>

<P>"And that is why you were going to kill yourself, because you knew you were going to spend the rest of your life in jail, correct?" Petrocelli asked.</P>

<P>"That is not correct," Simpson said. </P>

<P>Simpson also testified that he was feeling suicidal that evening. His letter, read on national television the day he fled, provided fodder for Petrocelli.</P>

<P>"There isn't a single word in those pages you wrote contemplating killing yourself where you express sorrow for Nicole's death, isn't that true," Petrocelli asked?</P>

<P>"Probably not, but I feel the whole letter went to my sorrow," Simpson said.</P>

<P>"Your sorrow?" Petrocelli retorted.</P>

<P>"Yes," Simpson said.</P>

<P>Tuesday, plaintiffs' attorneys Michael Brewer and John Kelly are expected to have a short examination of Simpson, before turning him over to the defense.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Defense Chooses Not To Cross-Examine Simpson</B></font><BR>
<IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/casefiles/simpson.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=0 BORDER=0>SANTA MONICA, Nov. 26 (Noon) -- Testimony came to an abrupt halt in the O.J. Simpson civil trial after the morning court break Tuesday, as the plaintiffs finished questioning Simpson and his defense team unexpectedly decided not to cross-examine their client.</P>

<P>"Your honor, I am sorry, I have changed my mind," Simpson lead defense attorney Robert Baker told Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki. "I will put Mr. Simpson on, and put on his testimony in our case, in December."</P>

<P>As court began, Judge Fujisaki formally dismissed a white, female juror for trying to get a message to a plaintiffs' paralegal. The juror, Ann-Marie Jamison, wanted to tell Steve Foster that she thought he was cute. She also had been seen drawing hearts on her notebook. The bailiff who delivered the note for Jamison was taken off the case. </P>

<P>In a break from normal procedure, the judge lectured the jurors and reminded them that they could be sequestered. </P>

<P>"A jury is not a social club, a jury is the fulfillment of a legal obligation," Fujisaki said. He did not say in open court exactly what happened.</P>

<P>The new juror, a 25-year-old white woman, said in jury selection that she thought Simpson was not guilty and likened him to the Michael Jordan of her parent's generation.</P>

<P>In testimony, plaintiffs' lawyers Michael Brewer and John Kelly each grilled Simpson for about 20 minutes, focusing mainly on domestic violence.</P>

<P>Brewer, who represents Ronald Goldman's mother, Sharon Rufo, sharply questioned Simpson about his suicide note. Simpson, Brewer pointed out, said in the letter that he was "a battered husband." Brewer then took Simpson through the three domestic violence incidents that the plaintiffs lawyers have extensively discussed, asking him each time if he felt battered.</P>

<P>"In connection with the 1993 incident when Nicole called 911 to have you removed from Gretna Green, were you battered in that incident?" Brewer asked?</P>

<P>"No," Simpson replied.</P>

<P>Quoting from Simpson's suicide note, Brewer pointed out that Simpson implored the public to "remember the real O.J., not this lost person."</P>

<P>"Mr. Simpson, this 'lost person' you refer to was a double murderer?" Brewer asked.</P>

<P>"No," Simpson replied.</P>

<P>During his examination, Kelly tried to draw a parallel between Simpson's 1989 domestic violence episode, when he pleaded no contest to spousal battery charges and the 1994 double murder.</P>

<P>After Simpson left Rockingham, Kelly noted, he borrowed a friend's car, returned to the house, and grabbed some clothes and a bag of jewelry. Kelly also pointed out that Al Cowlings claimed in his deposition that Simpson jumped over a neighbor's fence to get back on his property. Nevertheless, Simpson testified that he walked through the neighbor's gate.</P>

<P>When he picked up his clothes and jewelry, Simpson testified, he went back to his friend's car only to realize that he lost the keys to the car. Simpson then said he put the jewelry bag under the lid of a trash can and went to look for the keys. Simpson could not find the keys and went back to his friend's house --accidentally leaving the jewelry bag in the trash. Cowlings later went and retrieved the jewelry and found the keys, right near a fence.</P>

<P>"Mr. Simpson isn't this exactly what happened on June 12, 1994?" Kelly asked. "You went over a fence, you dropped something, you hid a bag in a trash can, and you almost avoided detection then."</P>

<P>Replied Simpson: "That's incorrect."</P>

<P>Court is in recess until Dec. 3. The plaintiffs are expected to call Robert Kardashian, business lawyer Leroy "Skip" Taft, Al Cowlings, and Paula Barbieri by her videotaped deposition before finishing their case.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Simpson's Friends To Testify Before Simpson Returns To The Stand</B></font><BR>
<IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/casefiles/simpson.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=0 BORDER=0>SANTA MONICA, Nov. 26 (Evening) -- Although O.J. Simpson finished testifying here Tuesday morning, his defense lawyer's promise to put him on the stand again in December ensures that the former football star will once again become the focal point of his civil trial.</P>

<P>But first the plaintiffs have to wrap up their case, which could end as early as the first or second week of December. Court is in recess for the Thanksgiving holiday until Dec. 3. When the case resumes, the plaintiffs are expected to call two lawyers who are also friends of Simpson -- Robert Kardashian and Leroy "Skip" Taft -- as well as another friend, Al Cowlings and his ex-girlfriend, Paula Barbieri by her videotaped deposition.</P>

<P>The plaintiffs plan to use the witnesses to impeach the testimony Simpson gave in the past three days.</P>

<P>Barbieri's deposition testimony will probably be used to point out inconsistencies in Simpson's testimony concerning a fight the model had with Simpson the evening before the murders. Her testimony will also cover a message she left on Simpson's answering machine the day of the murders, breaking up with him. Simpson said he never picked up that message, although phone records show he called his message service twice that evening.</P>

<P>Cowlings, who invoked his Fifth Amendment right not to testify about the low-speed Bronco chase in his deposition, will likely be asked about the 1989 domestic violence incident. Tuesday, plaintiffs' lawyer John Kelly, pointed out that Cowlings said in his deposition that Simpson jumped the fence while sneaking back on his property. Simpson said he did not. Kelly used the fence-jumping to draw a parallel with the murders at Bundy.</P>

<P>Taft is expected to be asked about cuts and abrasions on Simpson's left hand. Simpson has said that he arrived back from Chicago with only one cut on his middle finger. However, when he was examined two days later by Dr. Wayne Huizenga, who testified earlier in the trial, Simpson had three cuts and seven abrasions on his left hand. On the stand in the civil trial, Simpson said he could not be sure when he got the rest of the cuts on his hand, but maintained that he returned from Chicago with only one cut. Plaintiffs' lead attorney Petrocelli pointed out during Simpson's examination that Taft noticed more than one cut on Simpson's hand the day he returned.</P>

<P>Kardashian is expected to be asked about taking Simpson to pick up his golf clubs from the airport. Petrocelli contended during Simpson's testimony that Simpson may have used the bag in disposing the murder weapon. Kardashian may also be asked about the lie detector test Simpson took. Kardashian's testimony could present some dicey legal questions because, aside from being one of Simpson's closest friends, he was also one of his defense attorneys in the criminal case. Much of his testimony could be protected by attorney-client privilege.  </P>

<P>Tuesday, when Robert Baker said that the defense had no questions for Simpson, he made his announcement in front of the jury -- letting them know that Simpson will return.</P>

<P>"Your honor I am sorry, I have changed my mind," Simpson lead defense attorney Robert Baker told 
Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki. "I will put Mr. Simpson on, and put on his testimony in our case,  in December."</P>

<P>The defense has been very closed-mouthed about their trial strategy and lawyers refused to comment on their decision not to cross-examine Simpson.</P>

<P>While Baker's decision is surprising,  legal experts also say it is a strategical move by the defense. However, they are divided on what it was designed to achieve.</P>

<P>Some experts say that the defense, generally happy with Simpson's testimony, is allowing him to watch the rest of the plaintiffs' case and regroup before taking the stand again. His testimony, like it did for the plaintiffs, will likely add momentum to the defense's case.  </P>

<P>"I think there was a chance that if they examined O.J. today that would almost be it," said Steven Madison, a civil trial lawyer in Los Angeles. "The defense wants to make O.J. the centerpiece of their case."</P>

<P>But other trial observers say that the decision not to question Simpson could show the defense was very unhappy with his testimony.</P>

<P>"What the [defense] might be thinking, is that he looked so bad, that he got hurt, and that he hasn't responded to any preparation," says Barbara Allen Babcock, a professor at Stanford Law School and former trial lawyer. "Maybe they just don't want to risk it right now."</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Simpson's Lawyers Seek Mistrial Over Lie Detector</B></font><BR>
<IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/casefiles/simpson.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=0 BORDER=0>SANTA MONICA, Dec. 3 (Noon) -- Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki issued an instruction Tuesday morning in the O.J. Simpson civil trial, telling the jurors to ignore much of what they heard last week about Simpson taking a lie detector test. The judge also made a ruling that will make it very difficult for the plaintiffs to call Robert Kardashian, Simpson's friend and criminal lawyer, to testify this week.</P>

<P>In testimony, the plaintiffs called two people who said they saw Simpson hit Nicole Brown Simpson. Another witness, one of Simpson's neighbors, testified that he saw no Bronco parked outside the Rockingham estate around 9:45 p.m. on the night of the murders. This afternoon, Al Cowlings, Simpson's lifelong friend, is scheduled to take the stand.</P>

<P>Testimony was delayed for two hours in the morning session as the attorneys and Judge Fujisaki decided what the jury instruction should say. The judge apparently decided over the Thanksgiving break that jurors should be given clarification about Simpson's testimony about the polygraph test.</P>

<P>Judge Fujisaki began his instruction by telling jurors that defense lawyer Robert Baker opened the door for questions about the lie detector test during his opening statement when he talked about Simpson's offer to be tested. But, Fujisaki said, the jury must understand that plaintiffs' attorney Daniel Petrocelli's questions about the test do not constitute evidence -- only Simpson's answers are evidence. In his examination of Simpson, Petrocelli noted that Simpson took the test and scored a minus 22, which the plaintiffs' lawyer called "evidence of extreme deception."</P>

<P>"[Petrocelli's] questions do not and cannot establish that Mr. Simpson took a lie detector test," the judge said.</P>

<P>Simpson, Judge Fujisaki told the jurors, testified that he tried out the polygraph equipment, but did not take the test.</P>

<P>"There is no evidence before you that Mr. Simpson took a lie detector test, no evidence of any score on such a test, nor any evidence of what such a score means," Judge Fujisaki said. </P>

<P>But Baker told the court that he did not believe an instruction could fix the harm done by admitting testimony about the polygraph.</P>

<P>"I don't think any jury instruction is curative of the evidence that has gone in front of the jury," Baker said, telling the judge that the defense will soon file a motion for a mistrial.</P>

<P>Judge Fujisaki did not seem inclined to grant the motion. "We've come this far Mr. Baker," the Judge said. "If it is your opinion that a curative instruction won't do, that's your opinion."</P>

<P>The controversy surrounding Kardashian also delayed the start of testimony. Kardashian was supposed to testify this week. However, the plaintiffs never subpoenaed him and he left California. Plaintiffs' attorney John Kelly told Judge Fujisaki that Kardashian's lawyer said Kardashian would testify and did not need to be issued a subpoena. Kelly asked the court's permission to reopen the plaintiffs' case when Kardashian returns and can be served. But Judge Fujisaki refused, saying, "if you wanted him you should have subpoenaed him." The plaintiffs could still call Kardashian if he returns. Or they could call him during the rebuttal part of their case. Kardashian is reportedly on a business trip in New York.</P>

<P>When testimony began, India Allen, a former nude model, told jurors that she saw Simpson hit Nicole Brown in 1983. Another witness, Albert Aguilera testified that he and a friend saw Simpson hit his wife on the beach in early July 1986. The testimony of these witnesses contradicts Simpson's sworn statements last week, when he denied ever striking his wife.</P>

<P>"He swung his right hand and hit her across the face and she went down," Aguilera said.</P>

<P>Allen, who was working at a veterinary hospital in Beverly Hills, washed Nicole Brown Simpson's two dogs. As she took the dogs to Brown's car, Allen testified, O.J. Simpson drove up in a rage and confronted Brown, who was wearing a fur coat.</P>

<P>"I didn't buy this coat for you to go f**k somebody else," Allen said Simpson yelled before slapping Brown in the face and knocking off her glasses.</P>

<P>On cross-examination defense attorney Robert Baker noted that Allen posed naked in Playboy and suggested she was trying to revive her career by testifying in the civil trial. Allen, Baker noted, did not report the incident to police or prosecutors during the criminal trial.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Witnesses Recount The Simpsons' Stormy Relationship</B></font><BR>
<IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/casefiles/simpson.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=0 BORDER=0>SANTA MONICA, Dec. 3 (Evening) -- Al Cowlings took the stand Tuesday afternoon in the O.J. Simpson civil trial, but had a difficult time remembering much about the 1989 domestic violence incident the plaintiffs asked him about. Cowlings, Simpson's closest friend since childhood, contradicted his deposition testimony several times -- but admitted that Nicole told him that Simpson hit her.</P>

<P>Also testifying in the afternoon session were Palm Springs tennis instructor Jackie Cooper; Donna Estes, a friend of the Simpsons; Craig Baumgarten, one of Simpson's golfing buddies; and -- by videotaped deposition  -- Frank Olson, the chairman of Hertz. The plaintiffs used the witnesses to impeach Simpson's testimony in two broad areas: that he never hit Nicole Brown Simpson and that he did not obsess about their final breakup.</P>

<P>Olson's testimony will continue Wednesday. He is scheduled to be followed by Dr. Ronald Fischman, a friend of the Simpsons; Simpson's ex-girlfriend Paula Barbieri by videotaped deposition; and Leslie Gardner, the employee who gave Simpson a black sweatsuit for a Playboy video several weeks before the killings. The plaintiffs claim Simpson stabbed the two victims to death in a black sweatsuit. Simpson has claimed he didn't own a black sweatsuit at the time of the murders. Gardner is expected to testify that Simpson never returned the sweatsuit after the taping. </P>

<P>Cowlings, who testified that he was best man at the Simpson's wedding and loved Nicole like a sister, mainly discussed the New Years' 1989 domestic violence incident. As Cowlings recalled, either the Simpsons' housekeeper or Arnelle Simpson called asking him to come to the Rockingham estate early that morning. Simpson called him later that morning to retrieve a set of car keys he lost at Rockingham and some jewelry he left in a trash can at a neighbor's house.</P>

<P>Plaintiffs' attorney John Kelly had a difficult time getting Cowlings to contradict Simpson's testimony last week. An obviously reluctant witness, Cowlings contradicted his deposition testimony several times. For example, in his deposition, Cowlings said that Simpson lost the keys while jumping over a wall on his neighbor's property. Today, he testified that Simpson walked through a gate. But after much prodding and review of his deposition testimony, Cowlings did say that Nicole Brown Simpson told him that O.J. Simpson hit her that night.</P>

<P>"She had told me that she was hit, yes," Cowlings said.</P>

<P>Kelly pressed further: "Mr. Cowlings, did she tell you that Mr. Simpson had hit her earlier that morning?"</P>

<P>"Yes, she probably did, yes," Cowlings said.</P>

<P>The defense's cross-examination of Cowlings lasted only five minutes, underscoring two small points: that Cowlings said Nicole Brown Simpson "was pissed off" when he arrived at Rockingham, and that Simpson encouraged his wife to go to the hospital the next day.</P>

<P>Witnesses Jackie Cooper and Donna Estes testified about a memorial day 1994, weekend gathering in Palm Springs, Calif. where Simpson and then-girlfriend Paula Barbieri got in a fight allegedly about Nicole Brown Simpson. Cooper, a friend of Simpson's and Cowlings', played golf with Simpson that weekend and had an hour-long phone conversation with him. Cooper said that Simpson told him that Nicole Brown Simpson ended their relationship -- a fact Simpson flatly denied in his testimony.</P>

<P>"He said she had broken up with him and it was different this time, that it was final . . . she really meant it this time," Cooper said.</P>

<P>Cooper also told the jury that Simpson was not happy about the end to the reconciliation.</P>

<P>"I think that he was sad," Cooper said. "I think he was upset and in distress."</P>

<P>Estes, a social friend of the Simpsons who was also in Palm Springs that weekend, also said that O.J. Simpson was thinking about Nicole. Estes sat next to him at dinner one evening, and she said Simpson told her that "the best day he could think of was going to Disneyland with Nicole and the kids." But Nicole, Simpson told Estes, preferred going dancing and wearing short skirts. Estes also testified that Simpson told her that he got into a fight that evening with Barbieri because Simpson admitted that he was still in love with his ex-wife.</P>

<P>Baumgarten, one of Simpson's longtime golfing buddies, also testified about a fight Simpson had with Barbieri on the evening of the murders -- because he did not want her going to his daughter's dance recital. In his testimony, Simpson denied fighting with Barbieri about the recital.</P>

<P>"He reported to me that he felt it inappropriate that she join him at that recital," Baumgarten said. </P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Judge Allows Counselor's Testimony</B></font><BR>
<IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/casefiles/simpson.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=0 BORDER=0>SANTA MONICA, Dec. 4 (Noon) -- Nancy Ney, a domestic violence counselor who answered a call from  a woman named Nicole five days before the murders, took the stand Wednesday morning in the O.J. Simpson civil trial and told jurors that Nicole's ex-husband had threatened to kill her. Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki permitted Ney's testimony over strenuous objections by the defense who claimed it was hearsay and irrelevant.</P>

<P>Dr. Ronald Fischman, a friend of the Simpsons, also testified about problems in the couple's relationship and O.J. Simpson's demeanor the night of the murders. In the afternoon session, the plaintiffs are expected to call Paula Barbieri by deposition; Leslie Gardner, the wardrobe worker who issued Simpson a dark sweatsuit for his Playboy exercise video; Gigi Guarin, one of Simpson's housekeepers; and Dale St. John, Simpson's regular limousine driver.</P>

<P>The issue of Ney's appearance delayed testimony for half an hour, as the attorneys wrangled over its admissibility. Robert Baker, Simpson's lead defense lawyer, argued that it was hearsay and that it went to Nicole Brown Simpson's state of mind -- which was not relevant to O.J. Simpson's trial. But Plaintiffs' attorney Peter Gelblum noted that both Simpson and Baker had made his ex-wife's state of mind an issue because they have claimed that Nicole Brown Simpson was pursuing and stalking O.J. Simpson.</P>

<P>"Nicole Brown Simpson has been silenced, she cannot get up and rebut that on the stand," Gelblum said.</P>

<P>Ney, who volunteers on a domestic violence hotline for a battered women's shelter, described a call she received on June 7, 1994 from a woman named Nicole. The caller did not give her last name, but Ney related a number of striking similarities between the caller and Nicole Brown Simpson. The caller said she was in her mid-thirties; had been married for 8 years; had two children, one boy and one girl; lived in West Los Angeles; had family in the area; was Caucasian; and had a high-profile husband. Ney also said that the voice was similar to the recording she had heard of Nicole Brown Simpson on a 911 tape.</P>

<P>Nicole, Ney testified, was "very frightened" because her ex-husband had been stalking her. The ex-husband was repeatedly calling her and following her -- to the grocery store, to restaurants, and even tailing her in his car, she recalled Nicole saying. Nicole also said that her ex-husband had threatened to kill her.</P>

<P>"She said, he had told her a few different times that if he ever caught her with another man he would kill her," Ney testified.</P>

<P>Baker, on cross-examination, fiercely hammered Ney. At one point he asked her if publicity about the call had increased contributions to her shelter. Judge Fujisaki sustained an objection to the question. Mainly, Baker questioned Ney about discrepancies in two written accounts she made about the call. Ney filled out a standard form when she took the call and then two weeks later, after realizing that the caller may have been Nicole Brown Simpson, Ney jotted down some notes. In none of the written reports, Baker pointed out, did Ney mention that the caller was being stalked or had said her husband threatened to kill her.</P>

<P>Fischman testified about observations he made about the Simpsons as their reconciliation began to fail between April and June of 1994. He also discussed Simpson's demeanor at their daughters' dance recital the night of the murders. Fischman told jurors that in the final months of their reconciliation, Simpson felt ignored, confused, and rejected by his ex-wife's erratic behavior.</P>

<P>Lawyer Michael Brewer, who represents Ronald Goldman's mother Sharon Rufo, tried to get Fischman to say that Simpson was extremely upset at the dance recital, which ended several hours before the murders took place. But Fischman would only say that Simpson seemed "tired and withdrawn."</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Witnesses Contradict Simpson's Testimony</B></font><BR>
<IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/casefiles/simpson.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=0 BORDER=0>SANTA MONICA, Dec. 4 (Evening) -- O.J. Simpson's former girlfriend, his limousine driver, and his housekeeper took the stand Wednesday afternoon in the civil trial, as the plaintiffs continued their parade of witnesses designed to contradict Simpson's testimony. Leslie Gardner, a wardrobe stylist who bought clothing for the former football star's exercise video, also testified, telling jurors that Simpson did not return any of the dark sweat clothes she bought for him.</P>

<P>Randall Petee, a private investigator hired by the plaintiffs to determine how long it takes to drive between the Bundy and Rockingham residences, will continue his cross-examination Thursday. The plaintiffs are then scheduled to read into the court record notes from Lenore Walker, a defense expert witness who counseled the Simpsons. Deposition testimony from a number of different witnesses, including James Merrill, the Hertz employee who drove Simpson to his hotel from the Chicago airport the night of the murders, is also expected to be presented to the jury. Friday, the plaintiffs are planning to wrap up their case with testimony from Frederic Goldman and Juditha Brown. Sharon Rufo, Ronald Goldman's mother, is also expected to testify by videotape.</P>

<P>Dale St. John, who was Simpson's regular limousine driver -- but not on duty the night of the murders --, was used by the plaintiffs to impeach a number of different statements Simpson made  concerning his activities the night of the murders. St. John told jurors he picked up Simpson about 100 times and that he never had to wait at the gate. Allan Park, the limousine driver who picked up Simpson the night of the murders, testified earlier in the trial that he buzzed the intercom a number of times and had to wait for about twenty minutes before Simpson answered the call. Simpson did not buzz him in. Simpson testified that he didn't always buzz in his drivers. But St. John gave a different story.</P>

<P>"Was there ever [an incident] in the more than 100 times you went to pick up Mr. Simpson, when you buzzed at the intercom at the Ashford gate and someone didn't answer your first time buzzing?" lead plaintiffs' attorney Daniel Petrocelli asked.</P>

<P>"No," St. John replied.</P>

<P>The limousine driver also testified that he never saw Simpson's dog Chachi leave the property -- which contradicts Simpson's testimony that he worried about keeping his gates closed because his dog often ran off the property. </P>

<P>Focusing on the Bronco, the plaintiffs had St. John point out that he never saw the car parked on Rockingham Ave as it was on the night of the murders.</P>

<P>On cross-examination, the limousine driver said that it was usually chaotic when he came to pick up Simpson. And although Simpson sometimes answered the buzzer, usually one of his housekeepers picked up the phone. Simpson's housekeeper had the night off on June 12.</P>

<P>Simpson's former girlfriend Paula Barbieri testified by videotape Wednesday afternoon, and said she left Simpson a phone message at 7:00 a.m. on the day of the murders. Although Barbieri did not speak to Simpson again that day, she said he left her about three messages. In one of the messages, Barbieri testified, Simpson said "we were talking the night before about filling the house with babies, and what [is] wrong now." From the gist of Simpson's message, Barbieri said she "assumed" Simpson picked up her message. Simpson, however, repeatedly denied that he heard Barbieri's message before he left to Chicago.</P>

<P>Leslie Gardner, a wardrobe stylist who worked on Simpson's Playboy exercise video, testified that she bought Simpson two dark sweatsuits for the shoot. The plaintiffs contend Simpson wore a dark sweatsuit when he committed the murders; dark fibers were found at the crime scene and Brian "Kato" Kaelin testified that Simpson was wearing one the night of the murders. Simpson told jurors that he never owned a dark sweatsuit.</P>

<P>In court, Gardner identified photographs of Simpson wearing the sweat clothes she bought for him, and said that he never returned them to her. In her line of work, Gardner told the jury, it is standard procedure for the talent to keep all the clothing they use. But on cross-examination, she admitted that she did not know positively if Simpson kept the clothing.</P>

<P>"You have no idea whether Mr. Simpson kept the clothing for his personal use, right?" defense attorney Daniel Leonard asked.</P>

<P>"Correct," Gardner replied.</P>

<P>Outside the courthouse, the pre-Thanksgiving frenzy that accompanied Simpson's testimony has died down. One man carrying a sign for Jesus and one protester, pro-Simpson, greeted the media and several onlookers. He had about a dozen signs spread out on the lawn, several quoting from Mark Fuhrman's racist tape recordings. Another protester, carried a bullhorn and shouted "gold digger" at Fred Goldman as he left court.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Judge Cautions Jury On Hotline's 'Nicole' Call</B></font><BR>
<IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/casefiles/simpson.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=0 BORDER=0>SANTA MONICA, Dec. 5 (Noon) -- After permitting controversial testimony Wednesday from a domestic violence hotline worker, Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki told jurors Thursday morning in the O.J. Simpson civil trial that the testimony could only be used to show Nicole Brown Simpson's state of mind shortly before she was murdered. The testimony could not be used as evidence that Simpson stalked -- or threatened to kill --- his ex-wife.</P>

<P>Jurors also heard the deposition testimony of Mark Partridge, the attorney who sat next to Simpson on the airplane back to Los Angeles. He testified that Simpson gave him a somewhat detailed account of his ex-wife's death. Simpson, Partridge said, told him his wife and another man were killed in a crime, and the two bodies were found in the garden area at Bundy. Police, however, did not tell Simpson the details of his wife death.</P>

<P>Court recessed at the noon break, as the plaintiffs prepared to rest their case on Friday. Scheduled witnesses are: DNA expert Bruce Weir, Simpson's business lawyer Skip Taft; Goldman's mother Sharon Rufo by videotape; Juditha Brown; and Frederic Goldman.</P>

<P>Judge Fujisaki decided to issue the jury instruction without a request from the lawyers, as he did several days ago when he issued instructions on Simpson's alleged lie detector test. Defense attorney Robert Baker objected to the decision, but was overruled.</P>

<P>The hotline volunteer, Nancy Ney, told jurors on Wednesday that she answered a call from a woman named Nicole, who was being stalked and receiving death threats from her former husband. The caller did not give her last name but said she had been married to a high-profile man for eight years, had two children, and lived in West Los Angeles. Ney also testified that Nicole Brown Simpson's voice on a 911 recording was similar  to the caller's.</P>

<P>The judge told jurors that he admitted the testimony because Nicole Brown Simpson's state of mind has been an issue during the trial. The defense has contended that she was stalking O.J. Simpson and that she acted strangely at the dance recital the night of the murders. The judge also said that it was up to the jury to decide if the caller was really Nicole Brown Simpson. </P>

<P>"The testimony of Nancy Ney . . . was offered . . . to show Nicole's state of mind regarding the relationship at the time the call was made and to explain her conduct as it may relate to Mr. Simpson at the recital the night of her death," Judge Fujisaki said. "The jury must not consider the substance of her statements . . . as evidence of any events or whether such events ever occurred."</P>

<P>The plaintiffs read into the record deposition testimony from two Hertz employees who drove Simpson to and from the airport in Chicago after the murders. James Merrill, who picked Simpson up, said that Simpson, after learning of his ex-wife's death, called him three times within 20 minutes for a ride back to the airport. When Merrill received the first call, he was at home, about a half hour from the airport ,and Simpson's golf bag was in the trunk of his car. He said he suggested that Simpson arrange alternative transportation back to the airport. Simpson testified that Merrill never said that. The plaintiffs contend that Simpson put a small bag containing his bloody clothes into his golf bag and was frantic to get it back.</P>

<P>Merrill also discussed a call Simpson made to him a day after he left Chicago. Simpson testified that he called to apologize for his rudeness. Plaintiffs' attorney Daniel Petrocelli pointed out that Simpson also asked about his golf clubs again and brought up personal information during the conversation. Even though he did not know Merrill, Simpson talked about his deceased ex-wife, his divorce, and his children.</P>

<P>"He told you he loved Nicole, right?" Petrocelli asked.</P>

<P>"Yes," Merrill said.</P>

<P>"And you had never heard of Nicole, right?" Petrocelli continued.</P>

<P>"Yes," Merrill replied.</P>

<P>The Hertz employee who eventually brought Simpson to the airport, Raymond Kilduff, testified that Simpson "wanted to make sure he got his golf clubs back." Kilduff was also asked about the clothes Simpson wore to the airport. He testified that Simpson was wearing a blue jean shirt, blue jean pants, and black loafers without socks. This contradicts Simpson's testimony. He said he left the hotel wearing a white polo shirt and black pants -- the same clothes he wore when he met police later that day at his Rockingham estate. The plaintiffs are suggesting that Simpson bled on his clothes and had to change them before he reached his house. </P>

<P>The attorney Partridge, who sat next to Simpson on the plane, also testified that Simpson was wearing the blue jean outfit.</P>

<P>The plaintiffs briefly read to the jury deposition testimony from Dr. Lenore Walker, a defense expert witness who counseled Simpson after the murders. Walker's testimony was mainly used to verify her notes, which the plaintiffs have been using to impeach some of Simpson's testimony about the 1989 domestic violence incident and about his breakup with Paula Barbieri. Simpson testified that he did not get into a fight with Barbieri about his decision not to bring her to his daughter's dance recital. But Walker's notes tell a different story. One selection read: "Paula out and about and maybe out of town and a little bit upset about not inviting her."</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Jury To Hear Kardashian's Testimony</B></font><BR>
<IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/casefiles/simpson.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=0 BORDER=0>SANTA MONICA, Dec. 6 (Noon) -- Jurors in the O.J. Simpson civil trial will hear testimony Friday afternoon from Robert Kardashian, Simpson's friend and lawyer, even though he is currently in New York City. Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki ruled at the end of the morning session that the plaintiffs may read into the record excerpts from Kardashian's deposition.</P>

<P>In testimony, Simpson's personal attorney and business manager Leroy "Skip" Taft told the jury that he saw only one cut on Simpson's hand the day after the murders. Taft's testimony contradicted an account he gave in his deposition, when he said he saw at least two cuts on Simpson's finger. Bruce Weir, a statistician specializing in mixed DNA blood samples, also took the stand. He suffered a withering cross-examination by defense lawyer Robert Blasier who confronted him about mistakes he made in his calculations during the criminal trial.</P>

<P>The plaintiffs are likely to read portions of Kardashian's deposition where he talked about Simpson asking him to drive to the airport to pick up his golf clubs. Simpson said that he did not ask Kardashian. The plaintiffs contend that Simpson was frantic about his golf bag because it may have contained bloody clothes or the murder weapon. Also this afternoon, the plaintiffs are scheduled to call relatives of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman: Goldman's parents -- Sharon Rufo (by videotape) and Fredric Goldman -- and Brown's mother, Juditha Brown. When they finish testifying, the plaintiffs are expected to rest their case.</P>

<P>Judge Fujisaki permitted Kardashian's testimony after a short hearing on whether Kardashian was an unavailable witness. The defense argued that because the plaintiffs never served Kardashian with a subpoena, he should not be considered unavailable. At one point, lead defense attorney Robert Baker offered the plaintiffs a deal: "I'll trade you one Kardashian for one Fuhrman."</P>

<P>But Judge Fujisaki did not bite. "Nice try Mr. Baker," he said. "You may read it, I find [Kardashian] unavailable."</P>

<P>Taft's testimony provoked the most hostile examination so far in the civil trial. The business manager told the jury he and Simpson have grown to be close friends over their 27-year relationship, and on the stand Taft was obviously protective of the former football star. The plaintiffs called Taft to testify about one limited area -- the cuts on Simpson's left hand. Simpson testified in the civil trial that he had only one cut on his middle finger when he returned from Chicago on June 13. Two days later Simpson's doctor Robert Huizenga photographed three cuts and seven abrasions on his hands. Simpson told the jury that he received those marks after returning to  Los Angeles, maybe from wrestling with his young son. But Taft, when he was examined for his deposition, said he was "sure" Simpson had two cuts on his left hand on June 13.</P>

<P>The plaintiffs planned to use Taft to contradict Simpson. However when he was questioned by lead plaintiffs attorney Daniel Petrocelli about seeing Simpson's hand on June 13, Taft changed his story.</P>

<P>"You saw some cuts on Mr. Simpson's left hand, correct?" Petrocelli asked.</P>

<P> "As I sit here today I recall seeing one cut, Mr. Petrocelli," Taft replied.</P>

<P> The answer sent Petrocelli into a fury. At several points during his examination Petrocelli borrowed a trick from Simpson's criminal attorney Barry Scheck's infamous examination of LAPD criminalist Dennis Fung, where Scheck ended his  question with a combative: "How about that, Mr. Fung?" Confronting Taft with his deposition, Petrocelli almost shouted, "How about that, Mr. Taft?"</P>

<P>But Taft would not back down from his contention, telling Petrocelli that he was confused about the time period when he gave his deposition. Taft also said that when he met Simpson on the 13th he was "in a major state of shock." On cross-examination, the defense also pointed out that the Los Angeles police, when they identified Simpson on the 13th, found only one cut on his middle finger.</P>

<P>Simpson, who has not been in court since his testimony before Thanksgiving, returned today. He has been attending his child custody case in Orange County, Calif. But it is not in session on Fridays.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>The Victims' Mothers Testify</B></font><BR>
<IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/casefiles/simpson.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=0 BORDER=0>SANTA MONICA,  Dec. 6 (Evening) -- Nicole Brown Simpson's mother, Juditha Brown, tearfully testified Friday in the O.J. Simpson civil trial, telling jurors that Simpson bent over his ex-wife's coffin  at her wake and said, "I'm so sorry Nic, I'm so sorry." He then kissed her on the lips.</P>

<P>The mothers of both murder victims took the stand and talked about their relationship with their children. But while Juditha Brown took the stand and often broke down in tears recounting her story, Ronald Goldman's mother, Sharon Rufo, spoke by videotape. She was forced to explain why she had not seen her son for the seven years leading up to his murder.</P>

<P>The plaintiffs will call their final witness -- Fredric Goldman -- on Monday and then the defense will begin its case. The first defense witness is expected to be Los Angeles Police Det. Philip Vannatter, who testified in early November for the plaintiffs. Also scheduled for the defense are LAPD criminalist Andrea Mazzola; her boss Dennis Fung; LAPD Nurse Thano Peratis; and DNA expert Gregory Matheson.</P>

<P>Along with talking about her relationship with her daughter, Juditha Brown told the jury about her interactions with O.J. Simpson in the weeks leading up to the murders. Brown often glared at her former son-in-law as she spoke from the witness stand.</P>

<P>Simpson, Brown said, called her two or three days after Nicole Brown Simpson's 35th birthday on May 19, 1994.</P>

<P>"He said, 'she may not love me anymore'...and I said, 'well then go on with your life,'" Brown said. "Then he said, 'I tell you the first time she left me I take the blame, it's my fault. But the second time, it's gonna hurt.'"</P>

<P>The next time Brown saw Simpson, she said, was at the dance recital the night of the murders. Simpson, Brown testified, was "nervous and angry and upset." She and her husband sat in front of Simpson during the recital, and Brown claimed he acted strangely from the minute he arrived.</P>

<P>"Mr. Simpson came down and he put his hands on his hips and he didn't say a word," Brown said. "He looked through me, and I started to feel uncomfortable."</P>

<P>But later, lead defense attorney Robert Baker played a videotape shot the night of the recital that showed Brown kissing Simpson good night. The former football star was also joking around with Brown's husband, Lou, on the tape.</P>

<P>The dramatic ending of Brown's testimony also came under fire by the defense. Plaintiffs' attorney John Kelly asked Brown to discuss her interaction with Simpson at Nicole Brown Simpson's wake.</P>

<P>"I was at the coffin and Mr. Simpson came in and he said, 'could you move, could you move, I have to be alone,'" Brown said. "And then I heard him say, 'I'm so sorry Nic, I'm so sorry,' and then he kissed her on the lips."</P>

<P>Brown continued: "I followed him and confronted him, and I said, did you have anything to do with this and he said, 'I loved your daughter.'"</P>

<P>"Did he ever answer your question Mrs. Brown?" Kelly asked.</P>

<P>"No," Brown replied.</P>

<P>However, as soon as Brown was turned over for cross-examination, Baker asked her to reconsider her answer to that last question. To help Brown refresh her memory, Baker played a tape of her first television interview. In it, Brown could be clearly heard saying, "he said, 'No. I loved your daughter.'"</P>

<P>Also during Brown's testimony, the defense stipulated to the $250 cost of the dress she wore the night of the murders - -an important fact because that is the amount of compensatory damages Nicole Brown Simpson's estate is entitled to win. They are also seeking unspecified punitive damages.</P>

<P>Sharon Rufo, Goldman's mother, testified by videotape. Her attorney Michael Brewer, led her through a series of questions designed to show that she loved her son and explain why she had not spoken to him in the two years before he died. Rufo said that since her children moved to California in 1987 she communicated with "Ronnie" four times -- twice in phone calls and twice in unanswered letters -- but never saw him. Rufo also showed pictures of Goldman that she said she carried with her all the time.</P>

<P>To partly explain the lack of contact between the two, Rufo said the her then-husband Stephen Rufo did not want her to talk to her children. In fact, Rufo testified that her then-husband told Goldman one time when he called his mother, not to telephone the house. But Rufo said she heard the tail end of the conversation and took the phone away.</P>

<P>"I heard it was my son and I grabbed the phone, so he wouldn't hang up," Rufo said.</P>

<P>Goldman had called, Rufo testified, to tell her that he was appearing on the television show "Studs." The conversation, which lasted over an hour, was the last time Rufo spoke to her son, in November 1992.</P>

<P>Before the victims' mothers took the stand, portions of Robert Kardashian's deposition were read into the record. The plaintiffs used his testimony to once again show that Simpson was obsessed with getting back his golf clubs after the murders. They contend that he may have stashed bloody clothes or the murder weapon in the golf-club travel bag. Simpson testified in the civil trial that he and Kardashian were driving near the airport and decided to get the clubs. But Kardashian's deposition testimony differed with Simpson's account.</P>

<P>"O.J. asked me if I would drive him to the airport to get his golf clubs," Kardashian said.</P>

<P>Brewer asked Kardashian, "You thought that was somewhat of an odd request, didn't you that someone whose wife had been killed 36 hours earlier wanted to go to an airport to pick up golf clubs?" </P>

<P>"Yes," Kardashian replied.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Goldman Tells Jury About His Son</B></font><BR>
<IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/casefiles/simpson.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=0 BORDER=0>SANTA MONICA,  Dec. 9 (Noon) -- A choked up Fredric Goldman told jurors about his relationship with his murdered son, Monday morning in the O.J. Simpson civil trial, taking them from Ronald Goldman's childhood as a "happy go lucky kid" through his extensive, but unrealized plans to open a restaurant. </P>

<P>The plaintiffs rested after Goldman's testimony. The defense opened its case with Los Angeles Police Det. Philip Vannatter, who is currently on the stand. Lead defense attorney Robert Baker almost immediately began attacking Vannatter, focusing on the theme that poor police work produced contaminated evidence. Baker accused Vannatter of leaving the evidence-rich Bundy crime scene to investigate O.J. Simpson as a suspect in the murder. Vannatter maintained that he left Bundy and went to Rockingham to notify Simpson of the murder.</P>

<P>After Vannatter, the defense is expected to call LAPD criminalist Andrea Mazzola and LAPD nurse Thano Peratis.</P>

<P>Goldman began his testimony discussing his son's childhood in Illinois. Ron and his father participated in Indian Guides -- a program similar to the Boy Scouts -- and they went on vacations together. Although Ron played Little League, Goldman testified, neither was very interested in sports. They were a close family, and Ron's younger sister Kim used to call him "her second father," Goldman noted.</P>

<P>"Ron had a smile on his face from the day he was born, and he was a happy go lucky kid that never seemed to have a care in the world," Goldman said.</P>

<P>Goldman is suing Simpson for his loss of companionship from Ron's death, and he spent a good part of his testimony detailing the time the they spent together. Because they lived near each other, Goldman testified, he and his son often met for lunch or dinner, ant they attended frequent family events. In the last year of his life, Ron came home for the birthdays of his father, sister, and step-brother, as well as Thanksgiving, Passover, and mother's day, Goldman said. Toward the end of Goldman's testimony, the plaintiffs played a videotape of Ron speaking at his step-sister's Bat Mitzvah in November 1993. The video, which also showed Ron playing air guitar with his father, provoked an outpouring of emotion. Lead plaintiffs attorney Daniel Petrocelli was crying, as were two other Goldman attorneys. One juror appeared to be crying, as well.</P>

<P>"There was something special about our relationship...there was this bond that never dissipated," Goldman said.</P>

<P>Not all of Goldman's testimony painted his son as a saint. During his direct examination, Goldman admitted that Ron was a bit of a "lead foot" and lost his driver's license for amassing so many speeding tickets. Twice Ron was arrested for driving with a suspended license, and he once spent four days in jail because of it. Ron also had money problems and at one point was "in deep," Goldman testified. Ron later filed for bankruptcy because he was $12,000 in debt.</P>

<P>But Ron had moved on after his money problems and had established goals and plans for his life, Goldman testified. Ron planned on opening a restaurant and had asked his father if he would become a partner in the venture. Goldman agreed, he testified, but the plan was never realized. Later when cleaning out Ron's apartment, a tearful Goldman told the jury, he found sample menus and a drawing of the restaurant his son had made.</P>

<P>Each time Goldman mentioned the word "murder," he'd glare at Simpson.</P>

<P>Petrocelli brought Goldman's examination to an emotional close.</P>

<P>"Mr. Goldman, did you love your son?" Petrocelli asked.</P>

<P>"Oh God, yes," Goldman replied.</P>

<P>"Do you miss him?" Petrocelli continued.</P>

<P>"More than you can imagine," Goldman said bursting into tears.</P>

<P>"Do you think of him ever day," Petrocelli asked.</P>

<P>"There isn't a day that goes by when I don't think of Ron," Goldman replied.</P>

<P>After such an emotional examination, Baker conducted a gentle cross-examination. He questioned Goldman briefly about how much time the two spent together, and also inquired about the Goldmans friendships with police and FBI agents who worked on the case. Baker also asked Goldman about the book his family is writing. They received a $450,000 advance, Goldman testified, and the family is keeping about half.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Defense Begins Its Case By Grilling Vannatter</B></font><BR>
<IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/casefiles/simpson.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=0 BORDER=0>SANTA MONICA, Dec. 9 (Evening) -- Det. Philip Vannatter faced a hostile examination Monday afternoon in the O.J. Simpson civil trial, as the defense accused him of shoddy police work and lying when he obtained a search warrant for Simpson's house. The now-retired Los Angeles Police detective, who co-supervised the murder investigation, also faced tough questions about his handling of Simpson's blood vial.</P>

<P>Vannatter will continue his testimony Tuesday morning when the plaintiffs are expected to cross-examine him. Vannatter is scheduled to be followed by LAPD criminalists Andrea Mazzola and Dennis Fung, and LAPD nurse Thano Peratis.</P>

<P>Vannatter testified earlier in the case for the plaintiffs. But his testimony was limited his handling of the blood samples of Simpson and the two murder victims. As a result, Vannatter was on the stand for a mere 40 minutes, and lead defense attorney Robert Baker was frustrated in his attempts to broaden the scope of his questioning. Monday afternoon, Baker did not have that problem. He focused on several themes during his examination of Vannatter: that the police rushed to judgment against Simpson; that Det. Mark Fuhrman was unsupervised much of the time he was at Rockingham; that Vannatter's oversight of the investigation was inadequate; and that Vannatter improperly and inexplicably carried O.J. Simpson's blood sample to the Rockingham crime scene.</P>

<P>The defense also played the entire tape recording of Simpson's interview with Vannatter and his partner Tom Lange, in an effort to show that Simpson, even though he was exhausted from his red-eye flight and quick return from Chicago, had volunteered to go to the station and talk without his lawyer present. Baker also wanted to impeach Vannatter's testimony that Simpson never asked about how the murders were committed. In one part of the interview Simpson complains that the police won't give him any information about the killings.</P>

<P>The contentious questioning built to a crescendo as the afternoon wore on, and by the end of the day Baker was shouting at the retired detective, accusing him of shading his testimony to get a better deal for a book he is writing and to vindicate his inadequate police work.</P>

<P>At one point, Baker complained that Vannatter has denounced Simpson in public.</P>

<P>"I believe your client is guilty of murder, yes," Vannatter replied.</P>

<P>Baker also used his examination to bring up the specter of the racist rogue cop Mark Fuhrman as often as he could. Baker made sure that jurors knew that Fuhrman was the officer who first spotted a bloodstain on the door of the Bronco, jumped the fence to let his colleagues into the Rockingham property, and found the bloody glove while he was "investigating" alone for 15 to 30 minutes.</P>

<P>"Was [Fuhrman] ever wearing a coat?" Baker asked.</P>

<P>"I don't think so," Vannatter said.</P>

<P>The glove itself was an issue, as Baker pressed Vannatter to describe its condition -- whether or not there was dirt on it, if there was any insect activity around the blood spots. Baker also tried to show the glove had been placed there by pointing out that there was no blood trail leading up to it, nor any blood drops around it.</P>

<P>Vannatter was also forced to answer questions about the affidavit he swore out to obtain the search warrant for Simpson's home. The detective said that Simpson had left his home on an "unexpected" flight to Chicago, but Baker contended that Brian "Kato" Kaelin had told Vannatter that Simpson was going to Chicago on a planned trip. Kaelin testified earlier in the trial that the first words he said to the detectives when he answered the door were: Did O.J.'s flight go down? But Vannatter said that when he interviewed Kaelin, he referred the question to Arnelle, Simpson's daughter who was also living at Rockingham. Arnelle, Vannatter testified, told him she thought her father was home that night. Also in the affidavit, Vannatter said that the police had found a spot on the Bronco, which the LAPD Special Investigations Division had determined to be human blood -- which was not true. Vannatter said he made a mistake.</P>

<P>"You lied to the magistrate to get the search warrant, true or untrue?" Baker asked.</P>

<P>"No that's not true," Vannatter answered. "That's nonsense."</P>

<P>"Yeah," Baker muttered sarcastically.</P>

<P>To buttress its claims of poor police work, the defense showed a video clip of Vannatter walking through the middle of the Bundy crime scene and stepping on a blanket that had been used to cover Nicole Brown Simpson's body. Baker also skeptically questioned Vannatter about why he said he saw two cuts on Simpson's fingers but only photographed one cut. Vannatter also admitted that he did not inspect both of Simpson's hands for cuts and only photographed what he could see from a distance.</P>

<P>"So you didn't want to do a thorough investigation?" Baker asked, but an objection was sustained by the judge.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Simpson's Lawyers Challenge The Police</B></font><BR>
<IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/casefiles/simpson.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=0 BORDER=0>SANTA MONICA, Dec. 10 (Noon) The defense in the O.J. Simpson civil trial Tuesday morning began to set forth its theory that blood evidence in the case was planted and contaminated by the Los Angeles Police Department. On the stand, LAPD criminalist Andrea Mazzola faced a withering attack from the defense about the evidence she collected from the Bundy and Rockingham crime scenes.</P>

<P>Before Mazzola, retired Det. Philip Vannatter finished his testimony, coming under fire for his possession of the reference vial containing Simpson's blood. Thano Peratis, the nurse who drew Simpson's blood at the police station, is currently on the stand. The next scheduled witnesses are DNA expert Gregory Matheson and Det. Tom Lange, who co-supervised the murder investigation with Vannatter. LAPD criminalist Dennis Fung, who is on the defense witness list, has apparently been scrapped by the defense.</P>

<P>Defense attorney Robert Blasier launched into his examination of Mazzola, by noting that she was designated as the officer-in-charge of the investigation, although she was a rookie. The Simpson case was the third crime scene she worked on. Mazzola testified that the she was not actually in charge, but had the designation because she was slated to receive emergency phone calls that evening. Blasier also pointed out that Mazzola, not her supervisor Dennis Fung, collected most of the blood stains.</P>

<P>Next Blasier turned to sloppy procedure. Mazzola admitted that all of the blood evidence collected at Simpson's home was left unrefrigerated for  about 10 hours in the back of the crime scene truck, even though there was a refrigerator in the vehicle. In another error, the criminalists forgot to place a ruler next to bloodstains they photographed, Blasier noted. The defense also showed jurors a videotape of Mazzola collecting evidence at the Bundy crime scene. She could clearly be seen picking up the bloody glove and the  knit cap -- without changing gloves in between.</P>

<P>"Do you agree you did not change your gloves between collecting the glove and the knit cap?" Blasier asked.</P>

<P>"Correct," Mazzola replied, adding that she could not remember how often she changed gloves while she collected the evidence.</P>

<P>Later on cross examination by the plaintiffs, Mazzola said that she often changed her gloves, noting "to us changing gloves is the same as blinking, we don't think about it."</P>

<P>Fired back Blasier: "Ms. Mazzola, apparently you didn't blink between the glove and the knit cap, did you?"</P>

<P>"No, I did not," Mazzola conceded.</P>

<P>Blasier also asked Mazzola why she did not collect blood from the back gate of Nicole Brown Simpson's condominium. That blood was collected about a month after the crime and contained rich amounts of DNA similar to Simpson's type. The defense contends it was planted. Mazzola told the jury that she did not know that the condominium had a back gate when she was collecting evidence.</P>

<P>The defense sharply questioned Mazzola about her dealings with Simpson's blood reference vial. Blasier used the reference vial to raise the issues of planting and contamination. The plaintiffs contend that Vannatter brought the vial to the Rockingham crime scene on June 13 and gave it to Fung. The senior criminalist then put it into a bag and gave it to Mazzola who carried it to the lab and left it overnight on an evidence table, the plaintiffs say. Mazzola said she did not see Vannatter give the sample to Fung, and that she did not know if it was in the bag she brought back to the lab.</P>

<P>The reference vial was given the reference number 18 in Mazzola's notes. However, a pair of Simpson's tennis shoes -- turned into police the day after the blood sample -- was given number 17. Mazzola said she later switched the evidence numbers after Fung directed her to make the change. The defense contends that the numbering was not a mistake, and that Vannatter may have kept the blood overnight before turning it in to the lab.</P>

<P>But, if Simpson's blood sample was in the lab overnight, it could have been used to contaminate blood swatches that were in the same room, Blasier pointed out.</P>

<P>"So all the swatches were in open test tubes in the cabinet, in the same room with Mr. Simpson's reference blood, presumably in the trash bag?" Blasier asked.</P>

<P>"Correct," Mazzola answered.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Nurse Explains Missing Blood</B></font><BR>
<IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/casefiles/simpson.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=0 BORDER=0>SANTA MONICA, Dec. 10 (Evening) -- Nurse Thano Peratis insisted Tuesday afternoon that he drew about 6.5 cubic centimeters of blood when he took O.J. Simpson's blood sample the day after the murders. Also on the witness stand in the Simpson civil trial, Det. Tom Lange faced sharp questions about another possible set of shoes prints and a second attacker at the Bundy crime scene.</P>

<P>The defense also examined Gregory Matheson, LAPD chemist,  who talked about blood found under Nicole Brown Simpson's fingernails that did not match her blood type or those of Simpson and Ronald Goldman. Matheson said that the blood was likely Nicole Brown Simpson's but had degraded. Lange will continue his direct examination Wednesday. He is scheduled to be followed by LAPD criminalist Susan Brockbank; Rolf Baur, the nephew of Juditha Brown; tow-truck driver John Meraz; and William Blasini, who said in the criminal trial that he saw no blood on Simpson's Bronco when he looked at it in the impound lot.</P>

<P>Peratis testified previously in front of a grand jury and preliminary hearing for Simpson's criminal case that he drew approximately eight cubic centimeters of blood from Simpson -- anywhere between 7.9 and  8.1 cubic centimeters. The nurse's testimony gave rise to the defense's theory of planted blood, because only about 6.5 cubic centimeters of Simpson sample could be accounted for by police. But in the criminal trial, Peratis, who has a heart condition, testified by videotape that he was wrong and he really took about 6.5 cubic centimeters. Tuesday afternoon in the civil trial, testifying in person, Peratis stuck to that number.</P>

<P>"Isn't it accurate that you drew between 7.9 and 8.1 milliliters of blood?" Blasier asked.</P>

<P>"That is what I thought at that time," Peratis said.</P>

<P>"Is that you're testimony today, that you drew 7.9 to 8.1 milliliters of blood?"</P>

<P>"No," Peratis answered.</P>

<P>The long-time nurse steadfastly said that he made a mistake in his previous testimony, and even recalled that he had to stop filling Simpson's reference vial, probably because the needle hit the vein. During his examination, Blasier noted that Peratis developed some memory loss as a side effect of his illness. </P>

<P>Peratis also testified about dressing one cut on Simpson's left middle finger on the day Simpson gave the blood sample. Simpson has maintained that he only had one cut the day after the murders, although two days later his doctor photographed three cuts and seven abrasions on his hand. The defense tried to use Peratis to show that even the police noticed only one cut on Simpson's hand. But the nurse told Blasier that he only looked at one cut, and did not examine Simpson closely for others.</P>

<P>Lange faced many of the same questions that his former partner Philip Vannatter answered Monday. Lead defense attorney Robert Baker probed Lange about Mark Fuhrman's whereabouts at Rockingham and also charged the police with making a rush to judgment against Simpson. The two lead detectives, Baker noted, left the evidence-rich Bundy crime scene without even calling a coroner and went to Rockingham to find Simpson.</P>

<P>"You knew the LAPD was under great pressure in high-profile cases for not getting any arrests and not getting any convictions," Baker noted. "So you went over there and you wanted to get Mr. Simpson arrested and you wanted to get him convicted, isn't that true sir?"</P>

<P>Shot back Lange: "Sir, that's nonsense."</P>

<P>Baker tried to squeeze some alternative theories to the murder into his examination, as well. Showing Lange a photo of Nicole Brown Simpson's body lying in blood, Baker pointed out a "shoe print" about four feet away -- seeming to lead toward the front of the Bundy condominium. The other shoe prints at the crime scene lead to the back of the house.</P>

<P>"That would be significant if there was a shoe print four feet to the west of Nicole Brown Simpson, wouldn't it?" Baker asked.</P>

<P>"Certainly," Lange said.</P>

<P> Baker used the mark to ask Lange it it could have belonged to a police officer, or a second killer, or perhaps the same killer who was walking around the crime scene. But Lange refused to concede that the mark was actually what Baker said. </P>

<P>"I don't know what it was caused by," Lange said. "I don't even know if it is a print."</P>

<IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/casefiles/simpson.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=0 BORDER=0>SANTA MONICA, Dec. 11 (Noon) -- Det. Tom Lange clashed with defense attorney Robert Baker Wednesday morning in the O.J. Simpson civil trial over possible planting and contamination of evidence. And in a ruling, Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki gave the defense permission to recall Brian "Kato" Kaelin, to question him about statements he made in recent television interviews that Baker said are inconsistent with the former house guest's testimony.</P>

<P>Lange is still testifying on redirect examination. He is scheduled to be followed by LAPD criminalist Susan Brockbank.</P>

<P>Along with the ruling on Kaelin, Judge Fujisaki also decided that the defense could call expert witness John Gerdes. Gerdes testified in the criminal trial and coined the now-infamous description of the LAPD crime lab as a "cesspool of contamination." But he will not be able to use that phrase in the civil trial. Judge Fujisaki limited Gerdes testimony, ruling that he could only testify about whether or not specific evidence was contaminated.</P>

<P>Lange, who was the co-lead detective of the murder investigation, testified about a range of issues, from his theories of how the crime happened to his interview with Simpson at the police station to Mark Fuhrman's activities at Simpson's Rockingham estate. Baker did not hide his contempt for Lange's police work and testimony, aggressively  firing questions at the now-retired detective. Several times Baker shouted at the witness. Lange answered in a controlled, but sometimes sarcastic, monotone.</P>

<P>Although Fuhrman will likely not testify in the civil trial, the defense used its examination of Lange to make sure the jurors heard his name -- and knew that he had an opportunity to plant evidence. Baker focused his questions about Fuhrman's activities at Rockingham, when the detectives went to find Simpson after the bodies were discovered.</P>

<P>"Do you know whether Detective Fuhrman was leaving [Simpson's house] . . . .so he would have the opportunity to plant a glove?" Baker asked. There was then an objection sustained by the judge.</P>

<P>Lange told the jury that he had more important things to do at Rockingham than watch Fuhrman.</P>

<P>"Fuhrman was out of any sight that you had, from approximately 5:40 [am] to 6:15, correct?" Baker asked.</P>

<P>"No I can't say that," Lange replied. "I did not specifically keep a record of Mr. Fuhrman's movement...I can't give an accounting for every moment he was there."</P>

<P>Tensions escalated between Baker and Lange when the defense attorney accused the former detective of demeaning Simpson on "every television show you can get your mug on" in order to make money from a book deal. Lange and his former partner Philip Vannatter signed a book contract for $110,000. Lange told Baker he initially did not want to write the book, but decided he needed to tell his side of the story.</P>

<P>"We've been vilified to unbelievable extremes in this case and it's about time we stood up and replied," Lange said. "We've been lied about."</P>

<P>Baker and Lange also squabbled about his interview with Simpson at police headquarters the day after the murders. Baker has tried to show the jury that Simpson, even though he was exhausted from taking a red-eye to Chicago and then returning to Los Angeles, willingly answered questions from police. But Lange had a different impression.</P>

<P>"In all the minutes that you were [conducting the interview] did Mr. Simpson ever indicate to you that he would not answer any of your questions?" Baker asked.</P>

<P>"He skirted around quite a few," Lange replied.</P>

<P>Retorted Baker: "Like you're doing."</P>

<P>"Is that a question?" Lange asked.</P>

<P>"I guess it's a statement," Baker replied.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>No Cuts, No Socks, Witnesses Say</B></font><BR>
<IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/casefiles/simpson.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=0 BORDER=0>SANTA MONICA, Calif. (Dec. 11, Evening) -- Three people on O.J. Simpson's flight to Chicago on the night of the murders told jurors Wednesday afternoon in the civil trial that they noticed no cuts or blood on Simpson's hands. And Willie Ford, a Los Angeles Police Department videographer, testified that he saw no socks on the floor of Simpson's bedroom at a time before the department's criminalist said they were collected.</P>

<P>In Orange County, Calif., Simpson's custody trial finished late in the afternoon. The presiding judge, Nancy Wieben Stock, has taken the matter under advisement and will issue a written ruling at some point in the future, according to a court spokesperson. Simpson attended the custody trial Wednesday.</P>

<P>Also on the stand in the civil trial, Los Angeles Police Department criminalist Susan Brockbank faced tough questions about why a carpet sample from Simpson's Bronco was placed in a box with evidence from the Bundy and Rockingham crime scenes. On Thursday, the defense is expected to call Kelly Mulldorfer, who investigated a theft from Simpson's Bronco while it was parked in the impound lot; LAPD officer Frank Spangler; and John Gerdes, an expert who will discuss DNA contamination.</P>

<P>Brockbank's testimony centered on rare carpet fibers from Simpson's Bronco. Earlier in the trial, the  plaintiffs presented testimony from an FBI hair and fiber expert who said that the Bronco fibers were found on the Bundy knit cap and Rockingham glove. But the defense contends that poor police evidence handling may be responsible for the fiber transfer. Brockbank admitted that the carpet sample was put in the same box with the two gloves and the knit cap, but said each evidence item was individually wrapped and sealed with tape. Defense attorney Robert Blasier also noted that one of the Simpsons' dogs may have brought the Bronco fibers over to Bundy.</P>

<P>The three airplane witnesses were: passenger Stephen Valerie; the flight's captain Wayne Stanfield; and Howard Bingham, a photographer and an acquaintance of Simpson. Each spoke with Simpson and said he was friendly and did not seem upset. The three also did not see cuts or blood on Simpson's hand. However on cross-examination, they also admitted that they could not be sure Simpson had no cuts.</P>

<P>Valerie, who sat across the aisle from Simpson in the first-class cabin, presented the most detailed testimony. He told jurors that he watched Simpson carefully for the first hour of the flight, largely because he was a celebrity. Valerie even noticed Simpson was reading an "eight and a half by eleven document, loose leaf, with double-spaced typing," which he assumed was a legal document.</P>

<P>"I think I was probably staring," Valerie admitted. But he added that Simpson, "smiled and didn't seem too worried about my observations."</P>

<P>At times, Valerie was so eager to testify that lawyers for both the defense and the plaintiffs had to interrupt him to ask questions. During the cross-examination, lead plaintiffs attorney Daniel Petrocelli admonished Valerie to answer his question with a yes or no.</P>

<P>"If you're going to use a yes-or-no format, please make the questions succinct," Valerie responded.</P>

<P>In an effort to strike up a conversation with Simpson, Valerie said he looked at Simpson's fingers to see if he had a Super Bowl ring. Although he did not see a ring, Valerie testified that he saw no cuts or bleeding on Simpson's fingers.</P>

<P>On cross-examination, Valerie was forced to admit that he made several mistakes in his testimony. Although Valerie said he was sitting directly across from Simpson, Petrocelli produced a picture of the plane's interior that showed that Simpson was sitting at a diagonal. Also, when Valerie testified in the criminal trial he said he leaned against the window and pushed up the seat's footrest, which gave him a better view of Simpson. But Valerie admitted in his civil testimony that the plane was not equipped with footrests. Furthermore, Petrocelli noted, the plane's main cabin lights were off and Valerie was sitting seven feet away from Simpson.</P>

<P>"You really don't know whether [Simpson] had any cuts on his hand, correct?" Petrocelli asked.</P>

<P>"Correct," Valerie said.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Defense Witness Calls Blood Evidence Unreliable</B></font><BR>
<IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/casefiles/simpson.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=0 BORDER=0>SANTA MONICA, Calif. (Dec. 12, Noon) -- DNA expert John Gerdes took the stand Thursday morning in the O.J. Simpson civil trial, telling jurors that there was likely contamination between Simpson's reference blood and the reference blood of the two victims. Despite Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki's ruling that Gerdes could not testify about problems in the Los Angeles Police Department's evidence lab, the expert was able to slip in numerous criticisms about the lab's procedures.</P>

<P>Gerdes will continue cross-examination in the afternoon session. When he finishes the court will hold a hearing, out of the jury's presence, on the admissibility of Henry Lee's videotaped deposition. Lee's testimony details problems in the LAPD's collection of the evidence, and the plaintiffs have extensive objections to much of it.</P>

<P>Before Gerdes, the defense called two LAPD officers: Det. Kelly Mulldorfer and Lt. Frank Spangler. Mulldorfer, who was assigned to investigate a theft of credit card receipts from Simpson's Bronco while it was parked in an impound lot, said she could not remember seeing any blood in the Bronco when she looked through it. Spangler was at the Bundy crime scene, and had been Mark Fuhrman's supervisor for about a month when the murders happened. Spangler told the jury that Fuhrman was wearing a sport coat when he first saw him at Bundy. But 25 minutes later Spangler saw Fuhrman again, this time not wearing the jacket.</P>

<P>Along with the reference samples, Gerdes also saw contamination in blood drops found in the Bronco and at the Bundy crime scene. These drops were analyzed using the PCR testing method. The Bronco drops, one which contained a DNA mixture including a type similar to Ronald Goldman's DNA, are "not reliable" because control tests done alongside the DNA test showed evidence of somebody else's blood. The Bundy drop, which shows a DNA type similar to Simpson's, also had DNA that could not belong to Simpson, Gerdes testified.</P>

<P>Judge Fujisaki's decision to limit Gerdes' testimony to problems with specific blood samples, did not prevent him from discussing the LAPD evidence lab's conditions. Gerdes noted that the lab technicians did not follow strict anti-contamination procedures, such as putting bleach on the evidence table after working with a sample, or exposing their notes to UV rays, which kills DNA. Gerdes also said that Collin Yamauchi, who did many of the lab's tests, processed too many samples at one time. In one day Yamauchi processed 23 samples. A careful laboratory would process four or five in day, Gerdes said.</P>

<P>"I believe there is an unacceptable risk or chance, in the way those samples were handled, of cross-contamination," Gerdes said.</P>

<P>Gerdes also provided a running commentary on a videotape, made by the LAPD, that shows criminalist Andrea Mazzola collecting evidence. Although the video was made in an effort to show that the department carefully followed collection procedures, Gerdes pointed out many places where Mazzola could have inadvertently cross-contaminated the evidence. On the video, Mazzola frequently touched the ground with her gloves and then touched the tip of the tweezers, which came in contact with the evidence collection swatch.  At one point Mazzola wiped her gloved hand across the pavement; she did not change gloves between collecting samples. Gerdes also pointed out that Mazzola cleaned the tweezers with water, which does not kill DNA.</P>

<P>"I'll guarantee you that you can get DNA off those tweezers right now," Gerdes told the jury.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Plaintiffs Grill Defense's DNA Expert</B></font><BR>
<IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/casefiles/simpson.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=0 BORDER=0>SANTA MONICA, Calif. (Dec. 12, Evening) -- Defense DNA expert John Gerdes Thursday afternoon in the O.J. Simpson civil trial admitted on cross-examination that most of the DNA tests in the case appeared to be reliable. Gerdes conceded that there was "no direct evidence" of contamination in the majority of the tests, but maintained that the Los Angeles Police Department's poor collection procedures made it more likely that the tests could be wrong.</P>

<P>Court will be dark on Friday as the defense and plaintiffs lawyers decide which portions of forensic scientist Henry Lee's videotaped deposition will be shown to the jury. Lee's testimony will be played some time next week. Also scheduled next week: forensic pathologist Michael Baden and Herbert MacDonell, a bloodstain analyst.</P>

<P>On direct examination Gerdes said that DNA tests performed on blood found in Simpson's Bronco, on the Rockingham glove, and at the Bundy crime scene were likely contaminated. He also pointed out a number of improper collection techniques used by criminalist Andrea Mazzola that could have caused cross-contamination of blood samples. But on cross-examination, plaintiffs' lawyer Thomas Lambert asked Gerdes to discuss specific tests, not general procedures. Gerdes admitted that improper evidence collection techniques do not necessarily produce incorrect test results.</P>

<P>Gerdes was also forced to explain why none of the "control swatches" used in the much of the DNA testing showed contamination. When criminalists collect blood evidence at a crime scene they often use two cotton swabs. One swab is used to pick up the blood stain and the other swab is swiped on the area next to the stain. The second swab, called the control, does not have any DNA on it but is tested along side the one that does. If the contamination occurs, the control should have DNA on it. </P>

<P>Noting that none of the control swatches had DNA on them, Lambert asked Gerdes to explain his theory of contamination.</P>

<P>"So, somehow this contamination finds its way onto closed coin envelopes, closed bindles, and only gets on evidence samples and not control swatches?" Lambert asked.</P>

<P>"It would be a systematic sort of contamination," Gerdes replied.</P>

<P>"Shouldn't it get on the control swatches?" Lambert continued.</P>

<P>"[I]t should," Gerdes said.</P>

<P>Lambert also sharply questioned Gerdes about his credentials, noting that Gerdes had never been at a crime scene, never collected evidence, and did not perform DNA tests on forensic evidence. Gerdes, Lambert noted, only testified for defendants "trying to get off on rape or murder charges." </P>

<P>After Lambert's questioning, defense attorney Robert Blasier used most of his redirect to raise concerns about planting of evidence. He contended that the LAPD was "dry-labbing" the control strips -- replacing the actual strips with new ones after the tests were performed. Blasier also brought up the blood samples from the back gate at Bundy and the socks -- both of which were collected later in the investigation.</P>

<P>"Would you agree that the stain on the sock and [from the back gate] are consistent with blood coming from a reference vial?" Blasier asked.</P>

<P>"In terms of the amounts [of DNA], yes," Gerdes replied.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Defense Expert Casts Doubt On Socks And Gloves</B></font><BR>
<IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/casefiles/simpson.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=0 BORDER=0>SANTA MONICA, Calif. (Dec. 16, Noon) -- Defense bloodstain expert Herbert MacDonell testified Monday morning in the O.J. Simpson civil trial, telling jurors that a blood stain on Simpson's socks soaked through to the opposite side -- which would have been impossible if the sock was being worn. MacDonell also said that the stain could not have come from a drip or spatter, but rather was the result of compression.</P>

<P>Monday afternoon, forensic pathologist Dr. Michael Baden is scheduled to take the stand to testify about the length of the struggle between the murderer and victims Ronald Goldman and Nicole Brown Simpson. The defense revealed its witness list for the rest of this week, which includes Al Cowlings, Cora Fischman, Kato Kaelin, and O.J. Simpson himself on Friday afternoon. Simpson is expected to testify on direct for about an hour. Because of a court holiday break, he will then continue his testimony on Jan. 6. The videotaped deposition of Henry Lee will likely be pushed back until January.</P>

<P>The socks, which DNA tests showed had blood similar to Simpson's and his ex-wife's, were found on the floor next to Simpson's bed the day after the murders. The defense has contended that the blood was planted, and MacDonell's testimony gave credence to that theory.</P>

<P>MacDonell said he noticed about a dozen microscopic "little red balls" on the inside of the sock, opposite a large stain that plaintiffs DNA experts say was Nicole Brown Simpson's blood. MacDonell showed jurors a photograph of one of the balls, taken by defense expert Henry Lee.</P>

<P>"Is that consistent with somebody compressing and getting blood on . . . the sock and pushing it into the sock?" lead defense attorney Robert Baker asked.</P>

<P>"Yes, it is," MacDonell replied.</P>

<P>On cross-examination, the plaintiffs advanced theories to contradict MacDonell. Attorney Edward Medvene noted that the "little red balls" could have been transferred when the sock was being inspected or swabbed by LAPD criminalists. Perhaps the blood flaked off the elastic sock and landed on the opposite side, Medvene said. He also pointed out that the Simpson may have been perspiring when he was wearing the sock, which would have made a wet transfer possible.</P>

<P>The bloodstain in question, Medvene also noted, was only one of numerous stains -- on two socks -- that police found. MacDonell did not testify about problems with two stains on that sock which were consistent with Simpson's blood. Nor did he talk about the second sock, which also had stains consistent with Nicole Brown Simpson's blood.</P>

<P>MacDonell testified about his experiment with Aris Isotoner leather gloves. Using a vial of his own blood, MacDonell poured some of it on the gloves and worked it into the leather. After drying, MacDonell
said, the gloves did not shrink. </P>

<P>However on cross-examination, Medvene pointed out that MacDonell used new gloves when he conducted his experiment. The expert had no idea, Medvene asserted, what had happened to the gloves prior to the murders.</P>

<P>"You don't know if they left Los Angeles on the hands of somebody who was a television commentator at football games in Buffalo, in the snow," Medvene asked.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Renowned Coroner Says Goldman Suffered A Slow Death</B></font><BR>
<IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/casefiles/simpson.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=0 BORDER=0>SANTA MONICA, Calif. (Dec. 16, Evening) -- Dr. Michael Baden, the defense's expert forensic pathologist, told jurors Monday afternoon in the O.J. Simpson civil trial that a cut on Simpson's hand was probably made by broken glass and not by a fingernail. Baden, a renowned coroner, also said that Ronald Goldman was on his feet for about five minutes after he received a fatal cut to his jugular vein.</P>

<P>Baden will continue testifying on cross examination Tuesday morning. Following Baden, the defense is scheduled to read into the record the criminal trial testimony of William Blasini, who looked at Simpson's Bronco while it was in the police department's impound lot and saw no blood or fingerprint dust on it. John Meraz, the tow truck driver who stole several receipts from the Bronco when he took it to the impound lot, is expected to testify in person. He says he later returned the receipts.</P>

<P>Baden's testimony conflicted at several points with the plaintiffs' expert pathologist Werner Spitz, an equally respected coroner. Spitz, when he testified earlier in the trial, advanced a new theory that the cut on the middle finger of Simpson's left hand was made by fingernail gouging. Baden disagreed, saying that the cut was "most likely" caused by broken glass.</P>

<P>"It was cut by some sharp, irregular object . . . a jagged piece of glass or a knife," Baden told the jury. "I've never seen a fingernail gouge mark produce that long and deep a wound on somebody."</P>

<P>The two experts differed sharply in their estimates of the length of time the murders took, as well. Spitz's earlier testimony put the time of the killings at about a minute and 15 seconds. Baden had a much longer estimate. Although Baden did not address how long it took for Nicole Brown Simpson to die, he said Goldman may have been alive for 15 minutes. Goldman died from blood loss after receiving a wound to his jugular vein, Baden noted, but he probably remained standing -- and possibly fighting -- for five minutes after his jugular was sliced. Baden testified that a wound Goldman received to his aorta -- which Spitz said killed him -- was only of minor significance.</P>

<P>"Once this wound was inflicted in the neck causing complete transection of the jugular vein, Mr. Goldman was able to stand up and to continue struggling for perhaps up to five minutes until he lost enough blood  to get dizzy and to faint," Baden said.</P>

<P>Baden, who has investigated the deaths of John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr., also told jurors that there could have been two attackers at the crime scene and two weapons could have made the wounds. Baden said he based part of his two attacker theory on the fact that the victims did not scream. </P>

<P>"It is my opinion that it is more likely that there was more than one perpetrator," Baden said. "There could be one single weapon . . . but certainly much of the findings would be equally consistent with two weapons." </P>

<P>During Baden's testimony, Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki put a stop to another courtroom demonstration -- this time involving Simpson. Defense attorney Robert Blasier asked Simpson to take off his shirt so Baden could refer to a mark on Simpson's left arm. The plaintiffs' expert pathologist, Spitz, had identified the mark as a bruise -- possibly from Goldman striking Simpson -- in his earlier testimony.</P>

<P>"I will not have him [Simpson] disrobing in my courtroom," Fujisaki told Blasier.</P>

<P>However, Baden did say that he examined Simpson recently and the mark is still there.</P>

<P>Defense attorney Edward Medvene began his cross-examination of Baden at the end of the afternoon, accusing the pathologist of going on numerous television shows as an advocate for O.J. Simpson. Medvene also pointed out that Baden had no expertise in identifying fingernail marks or sharp-force injuries, including stab wounds.</P>

<P>Simpson was in court Monday and seemed to have difficult time listening to the sometimes graphic testimony about the wounds received by his ex-wife and Goldman. He grimaced, looked down at the floor, and closed his eyes at times. Both Fredric and Kim Goldman also attended the proceedings. During testimony about her brother's wounds, Kim buried her head in her arms.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Defense Witness Contradicts Simpson On Cuts</B></font><BR>
<IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/casefiles/simpson.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=0 BORDER=0>SANTA MONICA, Calif. Dec. 17 (Noon) -- Defense expert pathologist Dr. Michael Baden faced a contentious cross-examination Tuesday morning in the O.J. Simpson civil trial, refusing to back off his testimony that the killings could have taken up to fifteen minutes and that there could have been two assailants. But Baden contradicted Simpson on an important point: exactly when Simpson received cuts and scratches on his left hand.</P>

<P>At the start of the afternoon session, an alternate juror was dismissed. Sources said the juror, a Hispanic male, had mentioned on Christmas cards that he was on the panel, violating the judge's order not to discuss the case.</P>

<P>Plaintiffs' attorney Edward Medvene is currently finishing his recross-examination of Baden. Michael Gladden, who approached Simpson for an autograph at the Los Angeles airport the night of the murders, is due to take the stand later in the day. The defense is also scheduled to read into the record criminal trial testimony from Michael Norris, another airport witness, and William Blasini, who saw no blood or fingerprint dust when he looked into Simpson's Bronco while it was in a police impound lot.</P>

<P>The timing of when Simpson received some of the cuts and scratches on his left hand became an issue in the trial once again because Baden contradicted Simpson's earlier testimony. On the stand in November, Simpson told jurors that he only had one cut on his left hand when he returned from Chicago the day after the murders. (When Simpson's doctor, Robert Huizenga, examined him two days after his return, Simpson had three cuts and seven abrasions on his left hand.) The ex-football star told jurors that the rest of the cuts must have occurred after he came back from Chicago. But Baden testified that when he examined Simpson on June 17, five days after the murders, Simpson told him he received some of the cuts before he went to Chicago.</P>

<P>"Is it true Mr. Simpson told you he received some of those marks on his hand June 12 in Los Angeles prior to his trip to Chicago?" Medvene asked.</P>

<P>"Yes," Baden replied.</P>

<P>The plaintiffs sharply attacked Baden on his testimony Monday that Goldman likely stood for five minutes after receiving the wound on the left side of his neck. Baden based his theory on the fact that Goldman's bottom left pant leg and shoe were soaked with blood. But Medvene pointed out that Goldman had very little blood on the left side of his shirt, on his stomach, and on the top left side of his pants. </P>

<P>"Now sir, you're suggesting to us that blood from the jugular is going to go down the side of the shirt and leave [a small] amount of blood, and then somehow it's going to soak in, in that kind of fashion?" Medvene asked, pointing to a photograph showing Goldman's blood drenched pant leg.</P>

<P>"Yes," Baden replied, noting that the amount of blood that soaks into clothing depends on factors such as the type of fabric and how tight the clothes are against the body.</P>

<P>Fingernails were a point of attack as well, as the plaintiffs tried to counter Baden's assertion that the large gouge on Simpson's middle finger was cut by glass. Medvene noted that an attacker, grabbing the victim from behind, might have been subjected to scratching. </P>

<P>"It's certainly possible the victim could have attempted to scratch and pull the assailant [away] from the victim's throat, isn't that true sir?" Medvene asked.</P>

<P>"Yes," Baden replied.</P>

<P>Medvene continued: "Is it correct sir that it was your opinion that the injuries on Mr. Simpson's hand could have been the result of a struggle between Mr. Simpson and another human being, yes or no, sir?"</P>

<P>"It's not that that's my opinion, but it could have happened that way, yes," Baden said.</P>

<P>Baden and Medvene clashed several times because Baden refused to provide a one-word yes-or-no answers to questions. At one point Baden criticized Medvene for asking a question with too many facts in it. Baden also continued to provide long winded answers to yes-or-no questions -- which did not sit well with Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki.</P>

<P>"Excuse me, will you listen to the question and answer the question instead of arguing with the lawyer?" Judge Fujisaki admonished Baden.

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Juror Booted For Christmas Card</B></font><BR>
<IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/casefiles/simpson.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=0 BORDER=0>SANTA MONICA, Calif. (Dec. 17, Evening) -- A Hispanic male alternate juror, who wrote a Christmas card telling a friend that he was a juror in the O.J. Simpson civil trial, was dismissed Tuesday afternoon. In testimony, an in-line skater who passed by the Bundy condominium shortly before 9:00 p.m. the night of the murders said he saw a person "crouching" in front of the gate.</P>

<P>Also on the stand this afternoon: LAPD fingerprint specialist Gilbert Aguilar and Officer Daniel Gonzalez, who was at Simpson's home early in the morning of June 13. The defense also read into the record the criminal trial testimony of William Blasini, a used car buyer, who climbed into Simpson's Bronco and looked around while it was in a police impound lot. Blasini, who was in the car two months before police say they found blood on the console, said he saw no blood or fingerprint dust in the car.</P>

<P>Scheduled witnesses for Wednesday include former LAPD officers Paul Tippin and Otis Marlow, who are now investigators for the plaintiffs; photography expert Robert Groden; and Kato Kaelin.</P>

<P>The dismissed juror sent a Christmas card talking about his role in the Simpson case to one of his friends -- who happened to be a sheriff's deputy. During jury selection, the juror said he could be fair but thought the evidence was against the former football star. "If Simpson didn't do it, then who did?" the juror asked during the selection process. He also thought too many people needed to be involved for there to be a conspiracy to frame Simpson. Although Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki did not explain his reasons for dismissing the alternate this afternoon, the judge admonished the remaining members not to talk about the case or their association with the case. Only four alternate jurors remain. Three have been dismissed and one has moved onto the 12-member panel.</P>

<P>The defense used LAPD Officer Daniel Gonzalez to continue its attack on Detectives Tom Lange and Philip Vannatter. Gonzalez arrived at Rockingham in the early morning after the murders, shortly after the detectives. From his vantage point outside the property, Gonzalez watched the two detectives as they brought Arnelle Simpson from her bungalow to the main house. Although he hedged a little bit, Gonzalez thought he remembered them walking into the front door of Simpson's house. However, both Lange and Vannatter, in their earlier testimony, insisted they went in the side door of the house. Gonzalez also testified that he heard the detectives tell Arnelle Simpson in the driveway that her step-mother was killed, but Lange and Vannatter testified that they told her inside the house.</P>

<P>The in-line skater, Thomas Tallarino, was built up by the defense in its opening statement as a crucial witness -- someone who saw a person other than O.J. Simpson crouching outside Nicole Brown Simpson's Bundy condominium shortly before the murders. But Tallarino fizzled on the stand, insisting that he couldn't describe the person except for the fact that the individual was crouching and had dark, straight hair. Tallarino also testified that he could not tell if the person was O.J. Simpson.</P>

<P>Defense attorney Phil Baker was forced to impeach his own witness with his police statement, pointing out that Tallarino told police the individual was white or had a light complection. However, Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki sustained an objection to Baker's question.</P>

<P>On cross-examination, Daniel Petrocelli used the statement to point out several inconsistencies as well. But mainly, Petrocelli said, Tallarino was not important because he did not see the crime.</P>

<P>"So you don't have any idea what was going on at 875 South Bundy after ten [minutes before] 9:00, correct?" Petrocelli asked.</P>

<P>"That is correct," Tallarino replied.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Verbal Assault On Police Continues</B></font><BR>
<IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/casefiles/simpson.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=0 BORDER=0>SANTA MONICA, Calif. (Dec. 18, Noon) -- Los Angeles Police Officer Daniel Gonzalez, who testified that he saw blood drops on the console of Simpson's Bronco on the morning of June 13, came under fierce attack by the defense Wednesday morning in the O.J. Simpson civil trial. Lead defense attorney Robert Baker accused the officer of lying about the blood and of participating in a "code of silence" to protect other investigating officers.</P>

<P>The defense's expert on altered photographs, Robert Groden, took the stand briefly before the jury was dismissed so the court could hold a hearing on Groden's qualifications. After about 30 minutes of wrangling, Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki ruled that Groden could testify as an expert. He will take the stand this afternoon.</P>

<P>Baker continued -- and escalated -- his assault on the LAPD during Gonzalez's testimony. Gonzalez arrived at Simpson's Rockingham home at 5:20 a.m. on June 13, called by Detectives Mark Fuhrman and Ronald Phillips. Gonzalez told the jury he saw blood in several places on the Bronco: outside on the driver's side door handle, on the running board on the driver's side, inside on the driver's side door panel, and on the console. Baker first turned to the blood on the running board, which he contended could not be seen unless the driver's side door was open.</P>

<P>"You couldn't see anything on what you say is the running board of the car unless the door was open, isn't that true Officer Gonzalez?" Baker asked.</P>

<P>"No, that's not true," Gonzalez said.</P>

<P>"In fact," Baker continued. "You got into the vehicle that night, didn't you?"</P>

<P>"Absolutely not . . . I'm getting offended," Gonzalez replied.</P>

<P>The defense also pointed out several inconsistencies in a report Gonzalez made about two weeks after the murders and Philips' notes of an interview with Gonzalez in January 1995. Gonzalez did not mention the blood on the door panel in his written report, although he told Phillips about it. The interview notes also stated that Gonzalez saw blood on the steering wheel, the driver's seat, and the floor on the driver's side -- all of which Gonzalez disputed on the stand or said he did not remember seeing.</P>

<P>Baker contended that Gonzalez lied about seeing the blood inside the Bronco because he knew the police were being accused of planted it. The blood on the console was collected by police more than two months after the murders. The defense attorney also used Gonzalez to bring up Mark Fuhrman, who originally found the blood on the Bronco but is not testifying in the civil trial. By doing so, Baker effectively drew Gonzalez into the police conspiracy to frame O.J. Simpson.</P>

<P>"Is there any code for covering up for other police officers?" Baker asked.</P>

<P>"You get promoted for burning each other," Gonzalez replied.</P>

<P>"Have you ever been promoted?" Baker asked.</P>

<P>"No," Gonzalez said.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Shoe Photo Called A Fraud</B></font><BR>
<IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/casefiles/simpson.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=0 BORDER=0>SANTA MONICA, Calif. (Dec. 18, Evening) -- Robert Groden, the defense's expert witness on photography, told jurors Wednesday afternoon in the O.J. Simpson civil trial that the picture of Simpson wearing Bruno Magli shoes was most likely a forgery.</P>

<P>Court is not in session Thursday because a juror asked for the day off as a religious holiday. Groden will be on the stand Friday morning for cross-examination. Also scheduled Friday, the last day of testimony before the holiday break, are forensic toxicologist Dr. Fredric Rieders, to testify about the presence of EDTA, an anti-coagulant, in blood taken from the socks and back gate at Bundy and Simpson. The defense claims that the presence of high levels of EDTA in some blood evidence suggests that the blood sample Simpson gave to police was used against him in a police conspiracy. Because of the current schedule and the need to put Rieders on the stand Friday, a member of the defense said there is a "less than 10 percent chance" that Simpson will testify before the holiday break.</P>

<P>Groden started slowly, giving detailed testimony about "compositing"-- which is basically the art of creating bogus photographs. Although he is only an amateur photographer, Groden testified that he actually created fake photographs in two jobs and while working for himself. He also worked as a photographic consultant for the House of Representatives committee that investigated the assassinations of John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr.</P>

<P>After slogging through the process, Groden turned to the actual photograph and the whole courtroom sat up and paid attention. The picture, taken by photographer Harry Scull in September 1993, shows Simpson walking across the end zone at a Buffalo Bills football game. In the photo, Simpson is wearing a pair of Bruno Magli shoes -- the same kind that left bloody footprints at the Bundy crime scene. Scull testified earlier by video deposition and said he did not doctor the photograph, which was later published in the National Enquirer.</P>

<P>Groden told jurors he examined contact sheets, negative strips, and 8 x 10 prints of the photograph. He also traveled to Buffalo to view the original.</P>

<P>"Have you come to any conclusion about the authenticity of the subject photograph?" Defense attorney Daniel Leonard asked.</P>

<P>"Yes," Groden replied. "My conclusion is that there is a high likelihood of forgery."</P>

<P>Groden showed the jury a series of slides, where he pointed out 11 different indications that the photograph was a fraud. Starting with the contact sheet, which is a picture of negative strips, Groden noted that the Bruno Magli negative was slightly longer and tilted to the right of the other exposures. The one showing Simpson wearing the shoes also had a secondary edge on the bottom and a "false edge" on the side, which do not occur naturally in photography, Groden testified.</P>

<P>Other problems included color and the reflection underneath Simpson's raised foot. The hue of the Bruno Magli photograph was magenta, Groden said, while all the other pictures on the roll had a blue-green tint. He also pointed out that the photograph was the first picture on the roll -- an indication of fraud, Groden said, because it is easier to place a fake negative on the end of a strip.</P>

<P>On the actual photograph, Groden showed jurors two places toward the bottom of Simpson's legs that looked airbrushed. There was a line on the right leg, Groden testified, where the color changed from light to dark. On the left leg, Groden said he saw a "worm"-like shape. Because it was hard to see on the display screen, Groden passed the photograph into the jury box. Jurors looked carefully at the picture, squinting and holding it up to the light.</P>

<P>"Of all the things I found on that photograph, this is the most difficult to see," Groden said.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Plaintiffs Expose Defense Photo Expert To Ridicule</B></font><BR>
<IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/casefiles/simpson.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=0 BORDER=0>SANTA MONICA, Calif. (Dec. 20, Noon) -- The plaintiffs began a highly charged and personal attack against the defense photo expert Robert Groden, Friday morning in the O.J. Simpson civil trial. Attorney Peter Gelblum, who is handling the cross-examination, mocked Groden for his fascination with the assassination of John F. Kennedy, and accused him of concluding the Bruno Magli photo was a fake in order to start a career as an expert witness.</P>

<P>Although Simpson was scheduled to testify this afternoon, it is now clear he will not. The former football star was not even in court this morning. Groden will continue on cross-examination after the lunch break, He is scheduled to be followed by Dr. Frederic Rieders, a forensic toxicologist. </P>

<P>Sources familiar with Simpson's custody case say a written ruling in that matter will be issued  this afternoon, around 4:00 p.m., pacific time.</P>

<P>Groden, an amateur photographer who has worked creating fake photographs, told jurors on Wednesday that there was a "high likelihood" that the picture showing Simpson wearing Bruno Magli shoes was a forgery. The photograph was taken by freelance photographer Harry Scull in September 1993; who later sold it to the National Enquirer. Groden examined the original negative, as well as enlarged prints of the photograph, and contact sheets that showed the pictures on the roll of film that contained the Bruno Magli photo.</P>

<P>The plaintiffs spent most of the morning attacking Groden and, shortly before the noon break, turned to Groden's work with the actual photograph. On Wednesday Groden showed the jury 11 indications that the photograph was bogus. Just before the break, Gelblum started going through those explanations and offering alternative reasons for them. What looked like airbrush marks on Simpson's pant legs were actually creases in the material, Gelblum claimed. Odd marks on the negative that Groden said showed forgery, were scratches from winding the film, Gelblum said. Groden did not agree with any of the attorney's assessments.</P>

<P>Gelblum began his cross-examination by noting that Groden was not the first expert the defense hired to examine the photograph and alleging that the first expert found nothing wrong -- a remark quickly stricken by Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki. The judge was forced to strike several more of Gelblum's comments, and once admonished the jury not to infer anything when Gelblum accused Groden of stealing photographs of Kennedy's autopsy from the government.</P>

<P>"This is character assassination, and it has nothing to do with the photographs in this case," asserted defense lawyer Daniel Leonard during one of his many objections.</P>

<P>At one point, coming back from a sidebar conference, Gelblum accidentally bumped into Leonard. The two attorney exchanged heated words, and it appeared as if they might come to blows.</P>

<P>Leonard's complaints stemmed from Gelblum's highly personal attack on Groden and his credentials. Gelblum pointed out that Groden dropped out of high school, had never taken any courses in photography, and is not even a professional photographer. The plaintiff's lawyer also went through Groden's resume line by line and showed several areas where the expert appeared to stretch the truth about his previous experience. At one point, Gelblum elicited from Groden that he was being paid $2,000 a day from the defense, and had earned a total of $8,000 so far.</P>

<P>"That's pretty serious money for you isn't it, sir?" Gelblum asked.</P>

<P>When Groden said it was not, Gelblum noted that the expert was recently "on the street hawking videotapes" having to do with the Kennedy assassination.</P>

<P>Gelblum used Groden's fascination with the assassination, in an attempt to portray him as an oddball. The plaintiff's lawyer asked Groden about his work as a guide with a Kennedy assassination tour in Dallas, where people reenact Kennedy's final drive. The tour brings the guests -- in a limousine similar to the president's -- from the airport where Kennedy landed all the way to the hospital where he was taken after the shooting. At the appropriate moment, gunshots blare from the limousine's speakers.</P>

<P>Of his fascination with the Kennedy assassination, Gelblum asked Groden: "It's a little more than an interest, isn't it sir?"</P>

<P>"Yes," Groden answered.</P>

<P>"It's your life isn't it?" Gelblum shot back.</P>

<P>"It's my life's work," Groden replied.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Simpson Awarded Custody</B></font><BR>
<IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/casefiles/simpson.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=0 BORDER=0>SANTA MONICA, Calif. (Dec. 20, Evening) -- O.J. Simpson's children, Sydney and Justin, will be returning to the custody of their father. Judge Nancy Wieben Stock, who presided over the case in Orange County Superior Court decided that the Brown family failed to demonstrate by "clear and convincing evidence" that living with Simpson would be detrimental to the children's well being. </P>

<P>"[T]he children share a relationship with their father that appears to be strong, positive, and healthy with powerful psychological bonding," Judge Wieben Stock wrote. "[P]sychological testing, clinical observations, and a review of Simpson's history does not yield a picture of a man who has in the past, or is likely in the future, to lose control of himself in such a manner as to psychically or emotionally harm his two young children."</P>

<P>Simpson issued a statement saying he was "so very grateful today to have the children home again where they want to be." </P>

<P>Through their attorney Natasha Roit, Louis and Juditha Brown stated that they "love Sydney and Justin and pray for their safety as they return to their father." Roit also said the Browns, the children's maternal grandparents, may appeal the decision, in which they were given visitation rights.</P>

<P>In the ruling, Judge Wieben Stock stated that she did not consider evidence from Simpson's murder trial. The judge also noted that she was asked to postpone the custody case until after the civil trial. But she decided that a delay would in effect turn the custody battle into a third murder case against Simpson. That, the judge noted, would not have been good for the children.</P>

<P>"The court concluded that after 11 months of pretrial delay [in the custody case] and in consideration of the considerable risk to the children of further damaging publicity that would accompany an unprecedented third 'homicide trial' of Mr. Simpson, that terminating the custody case and continuing it indefinitely so that this matter could be retooled into a homicide trial, would be not in the best interests of the children," Judge Wieben Stock wrote.</P>

<P>The judge based her ruling in part on the fact that experts and testimony showed that Sydney and Justin were close to their father, and one of them even asked to live with him.</P>

<P>"As evidence of the children's lack of fear of their father, at least one child has expressed an unequivocal preference to be returned to the immediate custody of the father," the judge wrote. "The other child has declined to state a preference to the court appointed psychologist, but has stated in positive tones the strong bonds the child has with father's neighborhood and friends."</P>

<P>The Browns, according to people familiar with the custody trial, presented mainly a domestic violence case, in an attempt to show that Simpson was not fit to keep Sydney ,11, and Justin, 8. The judge agreed that the Nicole Brown and O.J. Simpson's relationship "reached a fearful crescendo" on Jan 1, 1989. She also found fault with O.J. Simpson's testimony in the custody trial about the incident, in which he pleaded no contest to domestic abuse charges.</P>

<P>"Although Simpson has admitted his fault in the incident resulting in injuries to Nicole, the court does not find his admissions to be entirely revealing," she stated in the opinion. </P>

<P>But Judge Wieben Stock decided that there was little evidence of Simpson battering Nicole after the 1989 New Year's incident.</P>

<P>"[T]he court finds to be true, testimony concerning slapping incidents which occurred on at least three separate occasions in the mid 80s, leading up to the 1989 incident," the judge stated. "Other testimony of sightings of puffiness on Nicole's face or bruises on occasions after 1989 is not sufficiently clear that the court can tie those observations to any domestic violence."</P>

<P>The Orange County Superior Court judge's decision sparked a media frenzy outside the civil trial and overshadowed the Friday afternoon testimony of forensic toxicologist Dr. Frederic Rieders.</P>

<P>As court broke for a two-week holiday recess, Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki, acknowledging that it was possible jurors would hear of the decision, admonished them not to pay any attention to news of the custody ruling.</P>

<P>"Whatever happens in any other case involving Mr. Simpson or his children has nothing to do with this case," Judge Fujisaki said. "Our case is fact specific."</P>

<P>Rieders took the stand despite the fact that the plaintiffs had not finished cross-examining photo expert Robert Groden. The plaintiffs agreed to postpone the rest of their examination to accommodate defense attorney Robert Blasier, who examined Rieders. Blasier is scheduled for back surgery on Christmas eve and is expected to be recuperating when court resumes on Jan. 6, 1997.</P>

<P>Rieders told the jury that blood samples taken from a pair of socks in Simpson's bedroom and from the back gate at Bundy contained EDTA -- a blood preservative. The chemical is often used in blood samples to prevent clotting. The defense contends that police planted blood from Simpson's reference bottle on the socks and back gate.</P>

<P>On cross-examination, plaintiffs' lawyer Thomas Lambert pointed out that Rieders did not conduct any of his own experiments on the blood samples. Lambert said that the FBI agent who did perform the tests will testify later in the case that although he found a small amount of EDTA in the blood, it was likely the result of contamination.</P>

<P>When court resumes in January, the plaintiffs will continue cross-examining Groden. After the photo expert, the defense is expected to call Otis Marlow and Paul Tippin, former LAPD officers who now work as investigators for the plaintiffs.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>A Look Ahead: Simpson's New Weapon</B></font><BR>
<IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/casefiles/simpson.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=0 BORDER=0>SANTA MONICA, Calif. -- When the O.J. Simpson civil defense team returns to court on Jan. 6, it will have a new weapon in its arsenal -- Simpson's children.</P>

<P>Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki instructed the jury before it left for an extended holiday recess not to pay attention to any news it hears about Simpson and his children. But the jury will likely hear about the verdict, experts say. Although it is not supposed to consider evidence from outside the courtroom, the custody ruling could affect their decision in the civil case. </P>

<P>"I think the jury will find out about it," says Paul Rothstein, a professor at Georgetown University's law school. "To them it will signal that yet another adjudicatory body has found [Simpson] to be an OK guy and not a murderer."</P>

<P>Judge Nancy Wieben Stock's decision, which gave the former football star full custody of his two young children, will likely influence the civil trial in a number of different ways, trial watchers say. On a subconscious level, the civil jury may weigh the effect on the children if it finds their father liable for the murder. More tangibly, if Simpson is found liable, the jury can reduce the amount of punitive damages it awards because he has to care for the kids.</P>

<P>The Dec. 20 ruling was not the final chapter in bitter legal skirmish between Simpson and Louis and Juditha Brown, the children's maternal grandparents. Although the Browns were awarded visitation rights in the custody decision, they have asked Judge Wieben Stock to stay her decision pending an appeal. A hearing on the stay is set for Jan. 10 in Orange County Superior Court. Sydney, 11, and Justin, 8, returned to Simpson's Rockingham estate shortly before Christmas. They had been living with their grandparent since Simpson's June 1994 arrest.</P>

<P>Even if the jurors did not see the pictures of Simpson and his children on the news, or read about the ruling in the newspaper, the civil defense team will likely try to bring up Simpson's victory in the courtroom. Lead defense lawyer Robert Baker has mentioned the case several times in court already. During his cross-examination of Juditha Brown, Baker asked about the custody case and accused her of letting Sydney and Justin sue their father in the civil case. Should Simpson take the stand again -- as his lawyers promise -- he, too, will probably discuss his children and try to slip in word of his victory in the custody case.</P>

<P>Experts also note that the defense team may shift its legal strategy because of the custody ruling. Instead of focusing on the suit filed by Nicole Brown Simpson's estate, where the damages would go to the two children, the defense can train its firepower on Fredric Goldman and Sharon Rufo, Ronald Goldman's parents.</P>

<P>"This narrows the target that O.J. has to shoot at," Rothstein says.</P>

<P>The defense may lessen its attack on Nicole Brown Simpson's character, which it previewed during opening statements, and instead pry into the relationship Ronald Goldman had with his parents. Earlier in the case, Rufo admitted, during videotaped testimony, that she had not seen her son in the seven years before his murder. Fredric Goldman testified that he and his son were extremely close. However, the defense may now try to dispute that in an effort to reduce damages or portray Goldman as trying to profit from his son's death.</P>

<P>The custody case will have a tangible effect on damages, should the jury find Simpson liable for the murders. In awarding punitive damages, the jury can take into account all of Simpson's assets and liabilities. Since Simpson will be his children's primary source of support, that could reduce the amount of money he would have to pay.</P>

<P>When court resumes January 6, the plaintiffs will continue cross-examining photographic expert Robert Groden. Groden's testimony was put on hold so the defense could call Dr. Frederic Rieders, an out of town witness. After the photo expert, the defense is expected to call more police witnesses, including Otis Marlow and Paul Tippin, former LAPD officers who now work as investigators for the plaintiffs. Also scheduled to take the stand that week are Brian "Kato Kaelin" and Cora Fischman, a friend of the Simpsons.</P>

<P>The defense also officially notified the plaintiffs that it planned to call Simpson again. It is not clear when, or if, he will testify. However, the remainder of the defense's case is expected to last about two weeks.</P>

<IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/casefiles/simpson.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=0 BORDER=0>SANTA MONICA, Calif. (Jan. 6, Evening) -- Defense lawyers began their assault on Nicole Brown Simpson's character Monday afternoon in the O.J. Simpson civil trial, eliciting testimony that Brian "Kato" Kaelin told police she "used coke."</P>

<P>Other defense witnesses this afternoon included Los Angeles Police officer Richard Aston; Otis Marlowe and Paul Tippin, two former detectives who worked for the plaintiffs as investigators; and Rachel Ferrara, whose criminal trial testimony was read into the court record. Earlier in the day, the plaintiffs confronted a defense photo expert with new photos of Simpson allegedly wearing <A HREF="/casefiles/simpson/updates/jan6a.html">Bruno Maglis</A> -- the same type of rare Italian shoes the killer allegedly wore.</P>

<P>Court recessed until Wednesday morning because a juror asked to be off on Tuesday for religious reasons. Among the scheduled witnesses Wednesday are: Kaelin, Al Cowlings, and Cora Fischman. The defense has also said it wants to read the criminal trial testimony of Laura Hart McKinny -- the aspiring screenwriter who taped Mark Fuhrman bragging about manufacturing evidence and making racist comments. However, the plaintiffs are vigorously opposing her testimony and Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki has not ruled on the issue.</P>

<P>Although three officers who worked on the Simpson investigation took the stand this afternoon, the defense was unable to produce the accusatory fireworks that marked the testimony of other police witnesses. Aston, whose partner Daniel Gonzalez was accused on the stand of being part of the police conspiracy to frame Simpson, left the witness stand relatively unscathed.</P>

<P>Part of the reason for Aston's lackluster testimony was his memory. Although he was at the Bundy and Rockingham crime scenes in the early morning after the murders, Aston has never testified about his work on the investigation. He told jurors that he could not remember seeing Mark Fuhrman climbing over the wall into the Rockingham estate, nor could he remember any discussion about police being worried about Simpson's safety. However, Aston did recall seeing blood on the console of the Bronco, although he was not sure which window he looked in to see it. The defense sharply questioned Aston about an impound report on the Bronco he filled out. The report noted that the Bronco's battery and alternator were in working condition -- a fact the police could not have known unless they pooped the hood or turned on the car.</P>

<P>Former homicide detectives Otis Marlowe and Paul Tippin were called to the stand mainly to highlight what the defense says is their conflict of interest -- working as investigators for the plaintiffs. Both Marlowe and Tippin denied they had a conflict, pointing out that they were not in charge of the criminal investigation and merely helped "work clues" called into the LAPD.</P>

<P>But Tippin, who is now an investigator for the Orange County District Attorney's office,  was also questioned about his interview of Kaelin at the West Los Angeles police station the day after the murders. Defense attorney Daniel Leonard quizzed Tippin about what Kaelin told him about Nicole Brown Simpson's "lifestyle." </P>

<P>"He said she used Coke," Tippin said.</P>

<P>Leonard also noted that Kaelin provided the police with a list of Nicole Brown Simpson's friends. At the top of the list was Cora Fischman, who the defense plans to call on Wednesday and ask more questions about Nicole's friends and habits.</P>

<P>The plaintiffs first question to Tippin on cross-examination, although the judge sustained an objection to it, gave a taste of things to come: "Did [Kaelin] tell you that Cora Fischman used coke?"</P>

<H2>Week by Week in the O.J. Simpson Criminal Trial</H2>

<H3>Pre-Trial Developments in the Case (January 11 - 20, 1995)</H3>

<P><B>JANUARY 11</B> - In a devastating attack on O.J. Simpson, the prosecution asserted that the former football legend abused his former wife for 17 years. The revelations came as lawyers began arguments about whether jurors should hear evidence of alleged domestic abuse by Simpson against Nicole Brown Simpson. The prosecution detailed more than 50 alleged incidents of abuse, including a number of alleged beatings and a threat by Simpson to cut off the heads of any of his ex-wife's boyfriends he caught driving his cars. The prosecution argued the evidence established motive and premeditation. The defense countered that the evidence was unsubstantiated and therefore should not be introduced during the trial.</P>

<P>The hearing began after the jurors and alternates were sequestered. Also, Judge Lance Ito ordered a women's shelter that may have served Nicole Brown Simpson to turn over records to the attorneys in the murder trial. The Sojourn shelter in Santa Monica expressed concerns about the cost of complying with the order and about the impact on the privacy of its clients. Judge Ito ruled that a waiver of confidentiality signed by Nicole Brown Simpson's father allowed for the release of the records.</P>

<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P><B>JANUARY 12</B> - The second day of hearings on the admissibility of alleged incidents of domestic abuse opened with the prosecution withdrawing 19 of the 52 incidents that it claims chronicled the alleged pattern of abuse. Still, Deputy District Attorney Lydia Bodin said the remaining incidents were sufficient to prove O.J. Simpson's motive for murder. "When he finally couldn't control her, when she was finally breaking away from him, when she had finally estranged herself from him and tried to distance herself from him, it is the people's contention that he killed her," Bodin said. The state withdrew the items of alleged abuse that were detailed in Nicole Brown Simpson's diary because they were inadmissible hearsay evidence. Judge Lance Ito said he would rule by Tuesday on what evidence would be admitted.</P>

<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P><B>JANUARY 13</B> - A black prosecutor and black defense attorney engaged in a bitter exchange with each accusing the other of bringing up the issue of race in the double murder case. The clash between Deputy District Attorney Christopher Darden and defense attorney Johnnie Cochran Jr. occurred during arguments over whether the defense should be allowed to ask a key detective in the case whether he ever uttered racial slurs against blacks. </P>

<P>The prosecution wants to exclude from trial what it calls "remote, inflammatory and irrelevant character evidence" regarding Det. Mark Fuhrman. The defense has portrayed Fuhrman as a racist with a propensity to lie and plant evidence. It wants to explore allegations that Fuhrman made racially derogatory remarks in the past and tampered with evidence in another case. The defense also has raised the theory that Fuhrman may have planted the bloody glove found on Simpson's estate several hours after the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman.</P>

<P>Meanwhile, a hearing on a motion to quash a prosecution subpoena issued to Simpson's first wife, Marguerite Simpson Thomas, was postponed.</P>

<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P><B>JANUARY 16</B> - Several days before opening arguments in the O.J. Simpson trial on murder charges, a rift has developed between two members of the defense team -- Robert Shapiro and F. Lee Bailey. It also was reported that it's up to defense lawyer Johnnie Cochran to try and resolve the dispute. The feud between Shapiro and Bailey apparently stems from the results of an internal investigation by Simpson's main investigator, William Pavelic, into leaks to the media. According to the New York Times, Pavelic concluded and told Simpson that Bailey was behind a series of leaks aimed at denigrating Shapiro's legal skills and enhancing his role in the case.</P>

<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P><B>JANUARY 17</B> - O.J. Simpson's lawyers sought to prevent the prosecution from using the names of 200 witnesses in their opening arguments at the start of the murder trial. In another development, prosecutors said they no longer needed medical records of the football legend's two children by his first marriage.</P>

<P>In a motion unsealed Tuesday, defense attorney Robert Shapiro complained that the witness lists presented by the prosecution to the defense earlier this year gave Simpson's lawyers no time to check the witness' statements and interview them before opening arguments tentatively set for Thursday. Judge Lance Ito had warned the prosecution at a hearing Jan. 5 that if the defense objected to the late witnesses and showed "good cause" why they should not be mentioned in opening statements, he would rule in their favor.</P>

<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P><B>JANUARY 18</B> - Judge Lance Ito ruled that the jury in the O.J. Simpson case can hear about several instances of domestic abuse in Simpson's marriage to Nicole Brown Simpson including the 1989 incident in which he pleaded no contest to wife beating charges.</P>

<P>The ruling was a major victory for prosecutors, who will try to use the evidence to show that the murder of Nicole Brown Simpson was the culmination of years of abuse.</P>

<P>In his ruling, Ito said that most of the domestic violence evidence can be admitted during the trial because it is necessary to prove motive and intent in the June 12, 1994 slayings of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman.</P>

<P>In earlier rulings, Judge Ito determined that relatives of the victims may sit in the courtroom for most of the trial., He also severely restricted Simpson's jail visitation rights after the sheriff's department complained that a book author met with Simpson in a room reserved for attorneys and material witnesses. </P>

<P>Judge Ito's ruling on the domestic violence issue came a day after prosecutors revealed in court documents that Simpson physically abused his first wife. The allegation was contained in documents filed Jan. 13, in response to a motion by Simpson's first wife Marguerite Thomas to quash a prosecution subpoena calling her to court. She was married to Simpson in 1967. The couple divorced in 1979. The documents also revealed that on the day of his arrest Simpson told his first wife that he was framed for the murders and planned to kill himself. </P>

<P>The court papers included a statement from a police officer who said he responded to a domestic violence radio call at the Simpson home 20 years ago and that Thomas stated then that Simpson had hit her. </P>

<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P><B>JANUARY 20</B> - Judge Lance Ito ruled that O.J. Simpson's lawyers cannot introduce two claims that detective Mark Fuhrman may be a racist. But Ito left the door open for the defense to use one other alleged racial incident and said he might also allow testimony that Fuhrman used the racial slur "nigger" if the defense could prove it was used "in a relevant incident."</P>

<P>The defense hopes to brand Fuhrman as a racist and to impeach his testimony that he discovered a bloody glove at Simpson's home that matched one found at the scene of the June 12 murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman. The defense has hinted that Fuhrman may have planted the glove.</P>

<P>In his ruling, Ito said the defense could not use a 1981 disability lawsuit Fuhrman filed in which he allegedly disparaged blacks and Hispanics. The defense also was barred from using a lawsuit filed against Fuhrman and other officers by a black man who said he was shot by the policeman following a robbery attempt, called "nigger" and had a knife placed near his feet.</P>

<P>In another ruling, Ito said prosecutors could not mention in opening arguments several witnesses who are expected to testify about domestic violence and that they could not appear until the defense team had a chance to interview them.</P>

<H2>Week by Week in the O.J. Simpson Criminal Trial</H2>

<H3>Week 1 (January 23 - 27, 1995)</H3>

<P><B>JANUARY 23</B> - Opening statements were delayed a day because of a
flurry of pre-trial arguments and motions.</P>

<P>O.J. Simpson asked Judge Lance Ito for permission to speak with jurors
before his attorney's opening statement and to show jurors his scars, injuries
and physical limitations while attorney Johnnie Cochran Jr. delivers his
remarks.</P>

<P>The defense surprised the prosecution with a list of 34 new witnesses and a
videotape of police walking through blood at the murder scene. The judge barred
the defense from mentioning many of the witnesses during opening statements,
and the defense agreed not to use the video.</P>

<P>The defense offered evidence of an alibi for the first time -- a witness
(Rosa Lopez) who said she saw Simpson's white Ford Bronco outside his home at a
time when the prosecution alleges he was two miles away committing murder. The
defense claimed that police detective Mark Fuhrman suppressed the
information.</P>

<P>Judge Ito ruled the defense could cross-examine Fuhrman about allegedly
racial comments he made to Kathleen Bell in 1985 or 1986.</P>

<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P><B>JANUARY 24</B> - Opening statements began after Judge Lance Ito rejected
an unusual motion from O.J. Simpson's defense team to allow the football legend
to address the jury.</P>

<P>Deputy District Attorney Christopher Darden was the first to speak for the
prosecution. He said that beneath Simpson's image as a star athlete and actor
was a jealous batterer and ultimately a murderer.</P>

<P>"He killed her (Nicole Brown) out of jealousy," Darden told the jury. "He
killed her because he couldn't have her." He called Simpson "an extremely
controlling and possessive man" driven by obsessive love. He then described 17
years of physical and emotional abuse that culminated in the murders.</P>

<P>Deputy District Attorney Marcia Clark then described the evidence against
Simpson, saying there was a path of "blood where there should be no blood,"
leading from Nicole Brown's condominium to Simpson's home. "That trail of blood
from Bundy through his own Ford Bronco and into his house in Rockingham is
devastating proof of his guilt," she told the jury.</P>

<P>But as the trial finally got underway, Judge Lance Ito suddenly pulled the
plug on live coverage after Court TV inadvertently televised the face of an
alternate juror. Judge Ito announced that he would decide Wednesday whether to
allow continued televised coverage of the trial.</P>

<P>The judge rejected Simpson's request to address the jury after Clark
denounced the idea as "a blatant attempt to impress the jury with his charisma
and star appeal."</P>

<P>"The motion to allow the defendant to directly address the jury will be
denied," Ito ruled. "The motion to allow him to exhibit to the jury his knee
injuries or the result of the scarring and the surgeries will be allowed."</P>

<P>The scars on his knees, which Ito is letting Simpson exhibit, would
presumably illustrate how old football injuries would have hindered his ability
to overpower two people and stab them to death.</P>

<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P><B>JANUARY 25</B> - O.J. Simpson's lawyer told jurors that the former
football legend is an innocent man, wrongfully accused by a prosecution that
wants to win the case at any cost.</P>

<P>Johnnie Cochran began his opening statement after Judge Lance Ito decided to
allow continued television of the trial. On Tuesday, Court TV had accidentally
broadcast the face of an alternate juror and the judge threatened to pull the
plug on television coverage.</P>

<P>The central theme of Johnnie Cochran's opening remarks was the
prosecution's rush to judgment. "This case is about a rush to judgment, an
obsession to win at any costs," he told the jury.</P>

<P>Cochran said police ignored at least two witnesses who offered information
that could clear Simpson. The witnesses include a woman who said she saw four
men walking near the murder scene the night of June 12 and another woman who
saw Simpson's car at home that night.</P>

<P>"After Mr. Simpson left, after 12 o'clock, she heard men's voices over on
the Simpson property...'til about 2 o'clock or 3 o'clock in the morning, "
Cochran told jurors. "She didn't know what was going on."</P>

<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P><B>JANUARY 26</B> - The trial was adjourned until Monday after the lawyers
engaged in bitter arguments over what the prosecution called serious misconduct
by the defense. The prosecution claimed defense lawyers "ambushed" them by
failing to inform them of names or statements of witnesses until the defense's
opening statement. </P>

<P>The prosecution asked Judge Lance Ito to strike from the record certain
remarks made by defense lawyer Johnnie Cochran during his opening statement
Wednesday and to instruct the jury to disregard the comments. Prosecutors also
want the judge to tell the jury that the defense had engaged in misconduct,
give the prosecution an unprecedented opportunity to deliver a second opening
statement, and delay the trial for 30 days. </P>

<P>Judge Ito said he would announce his decision Monday. But he also told the
defense to be prepared to finish its opening statement Monday and the
prosecution to be ready to call its first witnesses if he decided to let the
double-murder trial proceed immediately.</P>

<H2>Week by Week in the O.J. Simpson Criminal Trial</H2>

<H3>Week 2 (January 30 - February 3, 1995)</H3>

<P><B>JANUARY 30</B> - Judge Lance Ito reprimanded the defense for mentioning previously undisclosed potential witnesses during its opening statements. The judge said the defense had intentionally withheld from the prosecution the names of 14 new witnesses it mentioned in its statement. He said he would instruct the jury to ignore comments made about six of the witnesses. He denied a prosecution request for a 30-day delay in the trial but ruled the state could re-open its opening statement. </P>

<P>Following the ruling, defense attorney Johnnie Cochran resumed his opening statement. Cochran told jurors that the evidence collected in the case was "contaminated, compromised and ultimately corrupted."</P>

<P>He also told jurors that Simpson was practicing his golf swing in his front yard around the time that prosecutors said the murders took place.</P>

<P>During his opening statement, Cochran repeated the theme that Simpson was the victim of a frame-up in the "'rush to judgment" of his guilt.</P>

<P>For instance, he detailed a time line he said made it impossible for Simpson to have been the killer. He said evidence would show Simpson was practicing golf -- specifically, "chipping" -- in his front yard at 10:10 p.m., five minutes before the prosecution has argued the victims were killed.</P>

<P>He also countered the trail of blood that prosecutors said implicates Simpson. He argued that police carried a vial of Simpson's blood around with them for several hours rather than immediately bringing it to a police lab. As a result, he said, some of the blood sample was missing. He strongly suggested it had been used to contaminate a pair of socks found at the foot of Simpson's bed. </P>

<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P><B>JANUARY 31</B> - The prosecution called its first witnesses after taking advantage of a rare opportunity to re-open its opening statement. </P>

<P>Deputy District Attorney Marcia Clark told the jury that Mary Anne Gerghas, a key defense witness, is "a known liar and a Simpson-case groupie." During its opening statements, the defense said Gerghas saw four men running from the area of the murders. Clark said Gerghas was "obsessed" with the murders and made up her story. </P>

<P>The first witness in the case was Sharyn Gilbert, an emergency 911 dispatcher for the Los Angeles Police Department. Gilbert testified that she was on duty the night of Jan. 1, 1989, when Nicole Brown Simpson called police pleading for protection from Simpson. </P>

<P>Under cross-examination by defense attorney Johnnie Cochran, Gilbert acknowledged that she never spoke to anyone at the Brentwood estate but drew her conclusions from listening in for three to four minutes on an open line after receiving the call. </P>

<P>The second witness was police detective John Edwards who responded to the 911 call. He testified that a severely beaten Nicole Brown Simpson ran from the bushes screaming, "He's going to kill me, he's going to kill me," referring to O.J. Simpson.</P>

<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P><B>FEBRUARY 1</B> - A self-described friend of O.J. Simpson testified that the football legend discussed dreaming about killing his former wife a day after she was slain. During often emotional testimony, Ronald Shipp testified that he was driven by guilt to reveal Simpson's statement. </P>

<P>"That's not why I'm doing this Mr. Douglas. I'm doing this for my conscience... I will not have the blood of Nicole on Ron Shipp. I can sleep at night, unlike a lot of others," he said, during a heated exchange with defense attorney Carl Douglas. Shipp said he felt personal guilt over Nicole Simpson's death, "because perhaps I didn't do as much as I could have."</P>

<P>In addition to being a friend of both the Simpsons, Shipp said he counseled them after a Jan. 1, 1989, incident in which Simpson pleaded no contest to a charge of beating his wife.</P>

<P>Shipp, a Los Angeles police officer from 1978-1989, first made reference to the dreams in a book, "Raging Heart" by author Sheila Weller, which was released last week. Shipp says in the book that during a conversation at Simpson's home the night after the murders, Simpson told him: "I was interviewed by detectives and they asked me to take a lie detector test." </P>

<P>Shipp then asked Simpson, "Well, what did you say?"</P>

<P>According to the book, Simpson chuckled and replied, "Hey, to be truthful Ron, man, I've had a lot of dreams about killing her. I really don't know about taking that thing." Shipp testified the statement was an accurate reflection of the conversation. Shipp admitted that he initially lied to police and prosecutors by failing to tell them about the statement and instead told Weller about it because she promised him anonymity. </P>

<P>During a fierce cross-examination, Shipp acknowledged that he withheld the information from police, that he had a drinking problem at one time and was not really a close friend of Simpson's. But he denied trying to boost his acting career by turning himself into a so-called star witness in the case. </P>

<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P><B>FEBRUARY 2</B> - In a wide-ranging cross-examination , defense attorney Carl Douglas tried to make Ronald Shipp look like a liar with an alcohol problem. Shipp, who testified that O.J. Simpson told him he dreamed about killing his former wife, admitted he had a drinking problem and had been disciplined as a police officer for alcohol abuse. </P>

<P>Shipp said his drinking problem got out of hand in 1983 and led to a 15-day suspension from the police department after he didn't show up for work. Shipp said he left the department in 1989 because of the stress of the job. He said he was not drinking on the night that Simpson allegedly told him about the dreams.</P>

<P>Jurors also listened to a 1993 recording of Nicole Brown Simpson pleading for help from an emergency operator while in the background Simpson yelled and cursed at her.</P>

<P>Deputy District Attorney Christopher Darden told jurors that Nicole Simpson feared for her life and left a trail for investigators in a bank safe deposit box. The jury was shown several items found locked away at a Los Angeles bank including her will, three letters from Simpson, Polaroid pictures of her bruised and battered face and newspaper clippings about the Jan. 1, 1989 incident.</P>

<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P><B>FEBRUARY 3</B> - Denise Brown took the witness stand and tearfully told jurors how O.J. Simpson publicly humiliated and physically brutalized his wife. </P>

<P>In the most compelling testimony to date, Brown told of how a drunken Simpson once grabbed Nicole Brown Simpson's crotch in a crowded bar, bragging "his belongs to me," and how on another occasion he smashed her against a wall and literally tossed her out of his house. </P>

<P>Meanwhile, a new witness told prosecutors that he saw four men near Nicole Brown Simpson's home on the night of the murders. Defense attorney Johnnie Cochran complained to Judge Lance Ito that the state had failed to turn over their interview with Leif Tilden. Tilden saw four men near Bundy Drive between 10 pm and 10:30 pm on June 12, according to Cochran. Deputy District Attorney Christopher Darden said authorities had just interviewed Tilden and that the report would be turned over to the defense.</P>

<H2>Week by Week in the O.J. Simpson Criminal Trial</H2>

<H3>Week 3 (February 6 - 10, 1995)</H3>

<P><B>FEBRUARY 6</B> - O.J. Simpson had a "frightening" look in his eye and stared at his ex-wife during a dance recital on the day she and her friend were killed, Nicole Brown Simpson's sister testified during a second day on the witness stand. "He had a very bizarre look in his eye, it was a very faraway look," she testified about the events of June 12. Out of the jury's presence, the defense showed a videotape made outside the school after the dance recital. It showed Simpson greeting people and picking up one of his children. Judge Lance Ito ruled the video could be shown to the jury. The defense contends the video shows a relaxed Simpson.</P>

<P>During cross-examination, defense lawyer Robert Shapiro asked Brown about her previously acknowledged drinking problem. He asked her how much she had to drink on the nights that she testified about Simpson's alleged abuse towards her sister. She said she had been drinking on both nights.</P>

<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P><B>FEBRUARY 7</B> - The prosecution began presenting testimony to establish the timing of the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman.</P>

<P>The prosecution focused on the time that Ronald Goldman left the Mezzaluna restaurant - 9:50 pm and the suspected time of the murders -- 10:15 pm. The key witness, Pablo Fenjves, a neighbor of Nicole Simpson's, testified about an Akita dog that wandered around their neighborhood, persistently barking, until it led bystanders to Nicole Simpson's front gate and her body. Fenjves said that he first heard the dog barking about 10:15 pm and that the animal was still barking when he went to sleep at 11pm</P>

<P>The defense contends that Simpson could not have committed the killings, gotten rid of the evidence and returned home by 11 pm to catch a limousine for a trip to the airport.</P>

<P>Meanwhile, a juror was dismissed leaving 21 jurors and alternates to hear the case. </P>

<P>A 54-year-old black male was chosen to replace the 63-year-old white female who was dismissed. She was removed because her doctor may testify for the defense about Simpson's arthritis.</P>

<P>The jury now has seven women and five men. The ethnic breakdown is now nine blacks, one white, one Hispanic and one Native-American.</P>

<P>The defense accused the prosecution of violating a law requiring prosecutors to turn over all evidence favorable to the defendant. The defense referred to a videotape, shown in court Monday, showing Simpson leaving his daughter's dance concert hours before the slayings June 12.</P>

<P>Defense Attorney Carl Douglas said the tape, which he contended was given to the prosecution last summer, "clearly turned out to be a piece of very favorable evidence." Two prosecution witnesses, including Denise Brown, had described Simpson as moody at the recital, while the tape shows him cheerfully greeting his former in-laws and picking up his son. </P>

<P>Prosecutor Christopher Darden said the delay was "just another innocent mistake" in a case that has generated thousands of pages of documents and hundreds of videotapes. He also disputed that it was favorable to the defense, saying Simpson "looks like a completely different person" on the tape.</P>

<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P><B>FEBRUARY 8</B> - A neighbor of Nicole Brown Simpson testified how he discovered her body lying in a pool of blood outside her townhouse after being led to the murder scene by her agitated Akita. Sukru Boztepe said the dog pulled him to the crime scene by its leash just after midnight on June 13. The prosecution argues that Nicole Simpson and Ronald Goldman were killed about two hours earlier.</P>

<P>"I saw a lady lying down, full of blood," Boztepe testified. "I could see the person was blonde, I could see her arm. There was a lot of blood," he added. </P>

<P>Boztepe said he arrived at his apartment complex around the corner from Nicole's Simpson's condominium on Bundy Drive at about 11:40 pm and found his neighbor, Steven Schwab, in the complex's courtyard with the Akita. Schwab testified that he found the Akita wandering aimlessly near Bundy at around 10:55 pm. </P>

<P>On cross-examination, defense attorney Johnnie Cochran tried to show that the witnesses were only approximating the times that they heard the dog. While some said that might be the case, Schwab said he was sure of the time.</P>

<P>He said that his nightly dog-walking routine was set by when his favorite television reruns were on. He recalled taking his dog out 10:30 pm -- at the end of the Dick Van Dyke Show -- and returned home at 11:05 pm -- just as the Mary Tyler Moore show was starting.</P>

<P>Judge Lance Ito ruled that O.J. Simpson's first wife will have to testify in the case. The lawyer for Marguerite Thomas had tried to quash a subpoena, arguing that it was served in an unethical manner. </P>

<P>The prosecution wants to question Thomas about the telephone conversations she had with Simpson on June 17, the day of the infamous police chase.</P>

<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P><B>FEBRUARY 9</B> - The first police officer to arrive at the murder scene detailed the position of bloody shoe prints, a knit cap, a glove, an envelope and other pieces of evidence found near the bodies of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman.</P>

<P>Officer Robert Riske said he and his partner arrived on the scene early June 13 in response to an emergency 911 call about a possible burglary. He testified that he saw the body of Nicole Simpson first, then Goldman's, and noticed that the front door of Nicole Simpson's home was open. </P>

<P>He said he stepped over the body and entered the home to look for signs of other victims, evidence or a suspect. Riske said the house did not appear to be ransacked, but he did find two children sleeping, a tub filled with water and candles burning. </P>

<P>Asked by prosecutor Marcia Clark whether any evidence was disturbed, Riske said he avoided stepping through any blood at the scene by staying close to a fence and wall that led up the walkway and stairs to the front door of the home. He also said he did not touch any of the evidence, observing rules of crime-scene preservation. </P>

<P>During cross-examination, defense attorney Johnnie Cochran questioned Riske about the police procedures at the crime scene. Among other things, he asked him why he used Nicole Brown Simpson's telephone before dusting it for fingerprints and why no photographs were taken inside the condominium.</P>

<P>Meanwhile, the potential defense witness who says she saw four men leaving Nicole Brown Simpson's home on the night of the murders, was arrested for arrested for failing to pay a $23,000 bill for a three-month stay at a hotel while her home was being remodeled after the Los Angeles earthquake. Mary Anne Gerghas was charged with credit card fraud, grand theft and defrauding an innkeeper.</P>

<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P><B>FEBRUARY 10</B> - The court was in recess.</P>

<H2>Week by Week in the O.J. Simpson Criminal Trial</H2>

<H3>Week 4 (February 12 - 17, 1995)</H3>

<P><B>FEBRUARY 12</B> - Jurors toured the murder scene, going to Nicole Brown Simpson's townhouse and to O.J. Simpson's mansion two miles away. </P>

<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P><B>FEBRUARY 13</B> - The court was in recess.</P>

<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P><B>FEBRUARY 14</B> - Defense attorneys continued to cross-examine Robert Riske, the first police officer to arrive at the crime scene. Defense attorney Johnnie Cochran asked Riske detailed questions about the scene and timeframe as testimony resumed following a day off Monday. Riske answered a series of questions about what he found but repeated that he did not touch any evidence.</P>

<P>Riske said he didn't check trash cans inside the home or test the temperature of the water in Nicole Brown Simpson's bathtub. He didn't pick up the cup of melting ice cream or check the Simpson's pet Akita for evidence.</P>

<P>The defense contends that police mishandled evidence from the start of the case and overlooked some details like checking to see how much of the ice cream had melted in order to better determine the time of the murders.</P>

<P>During subsequent questioning by Deputy District Attorney Marcia Clark, Riske said it was not his job to investigate the murder. Rather, he said, that was the job of investigators and criminalists.</P>

<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P><B>FEBRUARY 15</B> - The prosecution revealed that O.J. Simpson's blood was found on a gate near the bodies of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman. The revelation came during a hearing out of the jury's presence on the sharing of evidence.</P>

<P>Deputy District Attorney Rockne Harmon said prosecutors did not want to turn over the blood sample to the defense until it conducted additional tests. The tests, he said, would show the absence of a preservative that coroners used on Simpson's blood taken on the day after the murders. The same preservative was used on samples taken from the victims' bodies. Harmon said that if blood had been planted to incriminate Simpson -- as the defense has maintained -- the preservative would show up. Judge Lance Ito said the FBI would conduct the tests on the gate sample, the bloody socks found in Simpson's home and on other evidence.</P>

<P>Meanwhile, a police detective testified that Simpson was not initially a suspect in the case and that police tried to spare him from having to hear about the killings from the media.</P>

<P>"The commander gave me a direct order that I should do everything I could to find Mr. Simpson and notify him in person before the news media became aware of what happened," detective Ron Phillips said. "He thought it would be very insensitive if we knew about it and did not notify him in person prior to the news media notifying him."</P>

<P>Phillips also testified that he and three other policemen went to Simpson's house to inform him about the deaths and to ask his help in the investigation. </P>

<P>"We never considered Mr. Simpson to be a suspect at that time," he said.</P>

<P>In another development, it was disclosed that one of Simpson's key alibi witnesses, Rosa Lopez, had left for El Salvador as a result of what the defense said were threats and press harassment. The defense has said that Lopez, a maid at the adjacent estate, saw Simpson's Bronco outside his home at the time the killings took place.</P>

<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P><B>FEBRUARY 16</B> - O.J. Simpson's first words on learning that his former wife had been killed were, "Oh my God, Nicole is killed. Oh my God, she's dead," a detective testified. Detective Ron Phillips said Simpson was "very upset" when notified of Nicole Brown Simpson's death the morning after she and her friend Ronald Goldman were found murdered. </P>

<P>Phillips testified about reaching Simpson by telephone at his Chicago hotel room after learning the former football legend left Los Angeles the previous evening.</P>

<P>While Phillips said Simpson became "very upset" at the news, he did not ask any questions about the circumstances surrounding the murders.</P>

<P>The prosecution is attempting to show that police properly handled the evidence at the crime scene and followed normal police procedures. </P>

<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P><B>FEBRUARY 17</B> - Defense lawyers closely questioned police detective Ron Phillips about the telephone conversation with O.J. Simpson in which he told the football legend that his wife had been killed. Phillips had called Simpson at his hotel room in Chicago the morning of June 13 to inform him about the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman.</P>

<P>Phillips had testified that Simpson did not ask any questions about the circumstances of the murders. But on cross-examination he conceded that Simpson asked him, "What do you mean, she's been killed?"</P>

<P>Phillips said he "never had a chance" to answer that question because Simpson became upset over the phone, "repeating himself and talking to himself over and over and over." Phillips also admitted that he did not have any details of Nicole Simpson's death at that point and would not have shared them if he did because the deaths were being investigated as homicides.</P>

<P>The defense wants to leave jurors with a different impression of the phone conversation than the prosecution which wants jurors to think Simpson didn't ask specifics about the murders because he had committed them.</P>

<P>The week ended with prosecutor Marcia Clark carefully unpacking the first two pieces of evidence in the trial -- a leather glove and blue ski cap found near the bodies.</P>

<P>Meanwhile, defense attorney Robert Shapiro said potential defense witness Rosa Lopez was still in the United States. The defense has said earlier in the week that Lopez had fled to El Salvador.</P>

<H2>Week by Week in the O.J. Simpson Criminal Trial</H2>

<H3>Week 5 (February 20 - 24, 1995)</H3>

<P><B>FEBRUARY 20</B> - The court was in recess because of the President's Day holiday.</P>

<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P><B>FEBRUARY 21</B> - The answer to one of the lingering questions in the case was answered when a police detective said Nicole Brown Simpson was killed first, then Ronald Goldman.</P>

<P>Detective Tom Lange said he reached this conclusion based on the crime scene evidence that included a lack of blood on the bottom of Nicole Simpson's bare feet.</P>

<P>She "perhaps went down initially before a fight really ensued with the other victim," Lange said. She "obviously didn't walk through the blood during the struggle."</P>

<P>The detective said there was blood on the soles of Goldman's white shoes and blood soaked through one toe. This, he said, showed that Goldman struggled with his assailant while Nicole Simpson's blood flowed nearby. Goldman, whose body was curled around a tree stump, also had defensive wounds on his hands, and his shirt was pulled up his back, the detective said. </P>

<P>The prosecution's theory of the case is that Nicole Simpson was the intended target and Goldman was killed when he came upon the scene.</P>

<P>Lange said his 20 years of experience as a homicide detective helped him to analyze the blood spatters and other evidence to piece together the slayings. He explained to the jury how Nicole Simpson was found in a semi-fetal position, her arm and hand extended in a "death grip."</P>

<P>During his testimony, Lange told of how he called Nicole Simpson's family to break the news of her death. He said her sister Denise Brown got on the phone and began to scream hysterically.</P>

<P>Under questioning by prosecutor Marcia Clark, Lange detailed many of the actions of detective Mark Fuhrman. Fuhrman, who alerted other investigators that he had found a bloody glove at Simpson's estate, has been attacked by the defense as a racist who planted evidence to incriminate Simpson.</P>

<P>As he did during the preliminary hearing, Lange explained why the four detectives decided to climb over a wall onto Simpson's property rather than wait for a search warrant. Lange said the detectives had several reasons to act as they did: there was a light on in the house and no one answered the door; a maid said to have been inside was not; and Simpson's Ford Bronco was parked "at a funny angle," with what looked like a bloody splotch on the passenger door.</P>

<P>"I felt that someone inside the house may be the victim of a crime, may be bleeding or worse," Lange said. "Fuhrman was standing closest to the left side of the gate. He said 'I can go over the wall.' I said, 'OK. Go.'</P>

<P>Meanwhile, the woman who could provide O.J. Simpson with an alibi was ordered to appear in court on Friday. Judge Lance Ito said both sides would have a chance to question Rosa Lopez, a maid for Simpson's neighbor. The defense has said Lopez saw Simpson's Ford Bronco at his estate at the time of the murders. </P>

<P>Lopez disappeared last week but then resurfaced, and her attorney said Tuesday that she wanted to leave the country and return to her native El Salvador in about a week. </P>

<P>Judge Ito scheduled a "conditional examination" of Lopez, which will be done outside the jury's presence. If the judge concludes Lopez might flee, she either will be ordered to testify and cross-examined on videotape which can be played back to the jury later if she is still unavailable. Or, the prosecution case will be interrupted so the defense can have her testify immediately.</P>

<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P><B>FEBRUARY 22</B> - The defense continued to try and show that police investigators were sloppy and that the evidence can't be trusted. </P>

<P>Detective Tom Lange conceded that he ordered a criminalist to take samples from blood found on the back gate at Nicole Brown Simpson's home on June 13, but those samples were not actually taken until July 3. The prosecution has said that at least one blood sample matches O.J. Simpson's blood type. </P>

<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P><B>FEBRUARY 23</B> - Judge Lance Ito and Christopher Darden engaged in a bitter exchange with the judge citing the prosecutor for contempt of court.</P>

<P>The dispute was finally resolved when Darden formally apologized to the court for his conduct , but the apology was slow in coming.</P>

<P>At one point, it appeared the stubborn prosecutor would fight the contempt citation. After the judge told Darden that all he had to do was admit his mistake and apologize, the prosecutor said he wanted a hearing on the issue. </P>

<P>"That says you want to fight," the judge responded. "Do you want to fight some more with the court? You're welcome to do so."</P>

<P>The altercation stemmed from a sidebar conference between the lawyers and the judge over an objection by Deputy District Attorney Marcia Clark over the way defense attorney Johnnie Cochran was cross-examining detective Tom Lange. The prosecutor was upset by Cochran's questioning of Lange about Faye Resnick -- the friend of Nicole Simpson who wrote a book about the Simpson's marriage and who moved into Nicole Simpson's home several weeks before the murders.</P>

<P>According to the transcript of the discussion, Cochran threw a jibe at the prosecution team, saying, "They obviously haven't tried any cases in a long time and obviously don't know how. But this is cross-examination."</P>

<P>Darden: "Who is he talking about, doesn't know how to try the case."</P>

<P>Judge Ito: "Wait, Mr. Darden."</P>

<P>Darden: "Is he the only lawyer that knows how to try the case?"</P>

<P>Judge Ito: "I'm going to hold you in contempt."</P>

<P>Darden: "`I should be held in contempt. I have sat here and listened to ... (interrupted by Ito.) </P>

<P>Judge Ito: "Mr. Darden. I'm warning you right now."</P>

<P>Darden: "This cross-examination is out of order."</P>

<P>The sidebar then ended abruptly and Ito sent the jury out of the court while he dealt with the contempt issue, for which he could have fined or even jailed the prosecutor. </P>

<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P><B>FEBRUARY 24</B> - Judge Lance Ito ruled the defense could interrupt the prosecution case to present a crucial alibi witness.</P>

<P>The ruling followed an extraordinary all-day hearing during which the witness - Rosa Lopez - promised to return to court to testify Monday rather than flee to her native El Salvador over the weekend.</P>

<P>Lopez, who worked next door to O.J. Simpson's estate, is expected to testify that she saw Simpson's Ford Bronco parked there at the same time the prosecution contends he was killing Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman.</P>

<P>Lopez told the court that she planned to immediately leave for El Salvador, complaining of harassment by reporters and expressing fear for her safety and that of her family. </P>

<P>Although the prosecution argued that it was an empty threat, Judge Ito agreed with a defense request to videotape her testimony in case she is not available to testify in person when the defense presents its case.  But the judge then changed his mind and ordered the sequestered jury brought to court for a nighttime session at which the defense would have presented Lopez's testimony. He then changed direction again, after prosecutor Marcia Clark said she couldn't work late Friday night because of child-care problems.</P>

<P>Ito then summoned Lopez to court and told her she could either promise to return Monday or spend the weekend in jail to keep her from fleeing. Before giving her word, a sobbing Lopez made one final plea: "I don't want to be here any longer. All these reporters have destroyed my life. I can't go out anywhere. I am so afraid of so many things I don't know what to say."</P>

<P>The prosecution argued that Lopez was not to be believed. "There are contradictions made under penalty of perjury. You can't believe anything Rosa Lopez says at this point," said Deputy District Attorney Christopher Darden. For instance, he argued that Lopez had booked a round-trip ticket to El Salvador even after she claimed on an affidavit she would permanently leave the country.</P>

<H2>Week by Week in the O.J. Simpson Criminal Trial</H2>

<H3>Week 6 (February 27 - March 3, 1995)</H3>

<P><B>FEBRUARY 27</B> - Rosa Lopez, the maid who lived at the estate next to O.J. Simpson's home, testified that she saw Simpson's white Ford Bronco parked outside his home at the time prosecutors say Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman were murdered.</P>

<P>Lopez said she saw Simpson's car as she walked her employers' golden retriever around 10:15 pm on June 12. Lopez said she was not wearing a watch at the time. But she said that she checked her clock as she left her bedroom to walk the dog, and it was little after 10 pm. Later that evening at around 11pm, she said she heard Simpson's voice outside. She also testified that detective Mark Fuhrman interviewed her on June 13 but failed to follow up with her even though she told him she heard loud voices that night.</P>

<P>The day also was highlighted by arguments between the attorneys over a July 29 statement that Lopez gave to the defense. The statement was not disclosed to the prosecution until Monday. Lopez never mentioned the Bronco in the July 29 interview with defense investigator William Pavelic. </P>

<P>Prosecutor Marcia Clark said that Lopez, in her first statement, also said that a woman named Sylvia Guerra could support her recollections. But Guerra was not mentioned in the second statement. The second statement -- when Lopez discussed seeing the Bronco -- was dated August 18. </P>

<P>"When the defense found out that Sylvia was not only not going to corroborate Mrs. Lopez but was going to say she was a liar and no such thing happened and 'I was not at her house' and 'I did not make an observation of the Bronco' she conveniently disappeared from the statement," Clark said. "Obviously we have some material discrepancies of a very important nature," she continued.</P>

<P>Clark then chastised the defense team for not turning over the statement. "As officers of the court, they should be ashamed, they should be embarrassed. In fact, their bar tickets should be hanging in jeopardy for this kind of misconduct, and this is misconduct, there's no question about it," she said.</P>

<P>The defense has told Judge Ito that they turned over all their notes and tapes to the prosecution. But defense lawyer Carl Douglas told the court Monday that he had learned of Lopez's earlier statement only Monday morning, and that no tape of that conversation had been made. But later, Pavelic told the judge that the interview had been taped.</P>

<P>The questioning of Lopez took place in front of a video camera and not before the jury. That tape can be played by the defense when it presents its case.</P>

<P>The judge had ruled on Friday that Lopez would testify before the jury. But Clark convinced him Monday to change his mind. She argued that having Lopez testify before the jury would give her testimony undue importance.</P>

<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P><B>FEBRUARY 28</B> - The legal wrangling over the testimony of Rosa Lopez continued with the prosecution claiming that the defense alibi witness was coached into stating what the defense wanted to hear.</P>

<P>Prosecutor Marcia Clark said Lopez, a former maid to Simpson's next-door neighbor, had been "told what to say through every bend and turn" of a July 29 interview with a defense investigator. A tape of the interview was revealed for the first time Monday. Clark accused the defense of deliberately withholding the recording, in violation of California discovery laws, to conceal "huge inconsistencies" in Lopez's account of the events of June 12.</P>

<P>Judge Lance Ito ordered Lopez's testimony halted until Thursday to give prosecutors more time to prepare for their cross-examination of the witness. Her testimony is being videotaped and may be shown to the jury when the defense presents its case.</P>

<P>The defense planned to finish its questioning of Lopez on Tuesday, but the judge also delayed it until Thursday.</P>

<P>"I am very sick, sir," Lopez told the court. "I don't eat every day. I'm not sleeping well, and I'm going to tell you this is not my fault." She then turned to leave the courtroom, saying: "I want to go rest, sir. I don't want any more questions."</P>

<P>Lopez testified that she saw Simpson's Bronco parked outside his mansion at 10:15 pm - the same time that prosecutors have said Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman were killed.</P>

<P>The legal arguments started early in the day when Clark expressed outrage over the defense's failure to turn over the tape of the July 29 interview with Lopez.</P>

<P>Clark said she had "never heard anything like" the 12- to 15-minute interview, in which she said Lopez sounded as if she had been "handed a script" by defense investigator William Pavelic.</P>

<P>"Mr. Pavelic got on the tape and spoke almost non-stop ... getting her to affirm, yes, yes, yes, yes," Clark said, noting that the entire interview was conducted in English, even though Lopez has requested a Spanish-language interpreter in court.</P>

<P>Clark also cited "numerous" and "glaring" inconsistencies between the July 29 statement and a second statement Lopez made on August 18.</P>

<P>Most notably, Clark said, Lopez's July 29 statement did not mention her seeing the Bronco outside Simpson's estate at 10:15 pm. </P>

<P>Defense lawyer Johnnie Cochran Jr. defended Lopez's credibility, calling her statements "entirely consistent." He conceded that Lopez did not specifically mention seeing the Bronco at 10:15 pm. But he said she the statement showed that Lopez was "adamant ... that the Bronco was not moved" from 8:30 pm, when she first saw it, until the next morning.</P>

<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P><B>MARCH 1</B> - The jury underwent another change when Judge Lance Ito dismissed a juror who appeared to have shown bias in O.J. Simpson's favor.</P>

<P>The judge replaced the juror, a 46-year-old black male, with a 38-year-old white woman.</P>

<P>It was the fourth time since the trial opened that a juror case has been replaced. The jury now has eight females and four males. There are eight remaining alternates, leaving open the possibility that there will not be enough jurors to finish the case. If this occurs, Judge Ito would have to declare a mistrial.</P>

<P>There have been reports that the dismissed juror may have offered to bet a week's wages before being empaneled that Simpson would be found innocent. The juror also was seen wearing a San Francisco 49ers cap at times while serving on the jury. Simpson played for the 49ers in the late 1970s.</P>

<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P><B>MARCH 2</B> - The prosecution started its cross-examination of Rosa Lopez in an effort to point out inconsistencies in the testimony of the potential alibi witness for O.J. Simpson.</P>

<P>During a vigorous cross-examination by prosecutor Christopher Darden, Lopez testified that she was not sure about the exact time that she saw Simpson's Bronco parked outside his home -- only that it was after 10pm.</P>

<P>Darden also suggested that the critical time of 10:15pm on June 12 was suggested to Lopez by defense team investigator William Pavelic. The prosecution has alleged that the murders were committed at about 10:15pm.</P>

<P>"All I said was that it was after 10," she said,</P>

<P>"So you don't know how long after 10?" Darden asked.</P>

<P>"No sir," she said.</P>

<P>Darden started his cross-examination by questioning Lopez on her claim for unemployment benefits and her statement to the court last Friday that she had made airline reservations. </P>

<P>Lopez admitted she had not made reservations for a flight back to her native El Salvador, as she had previously testified. </P>

<P>"That was a lie, correct?" Darden asked her. </P>

<P>"I didn't remember that I hadn't made reservations previously," Lopez answered.</P>

<P>But she agreed that she told the court she had made reservations last Friday when in fact she had not. </P>

<P>"And you lied?" Darden asked. "No," Lopez replied. </P>

<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P><B>MARCH 3</B> - The prosecution continued its vigorous cross-examination of Rosa Lopez as a defense attorney conceded that no decision has been made on whether to show her testimony to the jury.</P>

<P>Lopez, a housekeeper for O.J. Simpson's neighbors, claims she saw Simpson's Bronco parked outside his mansion at about the time the prosecution says he was murdering his ex-wife and her friend. </P>

<P>During cross-examination by Deputy District Attorney Christopher Darden, Lopez said her friend Sylvia Guerra, who is also a housekeeper, was lying when she told a detective about an alleged conversation in which she told a friend she'd been offered money to testify. </P>

<P>Darden, referring to an interview Guerra had with detectives, said, "Sylvia stated that you told her that the lawyers were going to give you $5,000 and that she could also get $5,000 if she testified for Mr Simpson."</P>

<P>"I never said that sir," Lopez replied. </P>

<P>"Sylvia is lying?" Darden asked.</P>

<P>"100 percent," said Lopez.</P>

<P>Meanwhile, defense attorney Robert Shapiro was asked whether the videotaped testimony will ever be shown to the jury. "I think we will make that evaluation when we hear what her entire testimony is." he said. "To date she has been very consistent on some issues and on some others she has clearly been inconsistent, and its an evaluation that will have to be made after we see all of her testimony."</P>

<P>In another development, Judge Lance Ito issued a written order sanctioning the defense for withholding from the prosecution information regarding interviews that Lopez gave defense investigator William Pavelic. Defense lawyers Johnnie Cochran and Carl Douglas each were fined $950, and Ito said he would instruct jurors that the defense violated the law if Lopez's taped testimony is played for the jury.</P>

<H2>Week by Week in the O.J. Simpson Criminal Trial</H2>

<H3>Week 7 (March 6 - 10, 1995)</H3>

<P><B>MARCH 6</B> - A police detective testified that authorities never considered anyone other than O.J. Simpson as a suspect in the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman.</P>

<P>Defense attorney Johnnie Cochran asked detective Tom Lange if he had ever considered "any other theory than that O.J. Simpson was the only perpetrator in this case."</P>

<P>"I had absolutely no other evidence that would point me in any other direction," Lange replied. </P>

<P>Cochran asked Lange if he had considered that Ronald Goldman, and not Nicole Brown Simpson, might have been the prime target of the June 12 attack. Lange said there was no evidence to support such a theory.</P>

<P>Lange testified that investigators looked only superficially at a possible drug angle to the double murders. He also said police did not look into the background of Faye Resnick, who was Nicole Brown Simpson's roommate at the time of the slaying, but was in a drug rehabilitation center the night of the murders. </P>

<P>"In any murder there's always the possibility that drugs may have been involved," but he said in this case investigators were focused on "another direction."</P>

<P>The defense has been trying to show that police investigators were sloppy in their handling of the crime scene and the evidence in the case.</P>

<P>Cochran tried to establish that investigators did not seek to determine the time of Goldman's death by reviewing the contents of his stomach.</P>

<P>Lange's testimony was preceded by the testimony of a surprise prosecution witness - a neighbor of Nicole Brown Simpson who said he heard a dog barking near the crime scene at 10:20 pm on the night of the murders. </P>

<P>Mark Storfer said he was in his bed with his wife and son. After the boy fell asleep around 10 pm, Storfer took him to his own bed.</P>

<P>"As I was taking him downstairs, I heard a dog barking," Storfer said. "I was concerned it would wake up my son. It was that loud and persistent."</P>

<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P><B>MARCH 7</B> - Tom Lange resumed his testimony after the defense made its request to Judge Lance Ito to acquire documents from an Internal Affairs investigation of detective Mark Fuhrman. </P>

<P>The judge ordered the Los Angeles Police Department's custodian of records to bring Fuhrman's records to court for him to review.</P>

<P>During his testimony, Lange dismissed a number of defense theories about the murders and explained why he concluded that Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman were killed by the same person.</P>

<P>Lange explained that a blood drop on Goldman's shoe had a mixture of blood from the two victims, suggesting the blood came from a single weapon from a single killer. He also said there was only one set of bloody footprints at the murder scene.</P>

<P>He denied that the murders had any of the earmarks of a drug-related homicide. And he testified that blood found under Nicole Simpson's fingernails was hers. The defense has maintained the blood did not match either of the victims or O.J. Simpson.</P>

<P>Judge Ito later ruled that the prosecution wrongly elicited that testimony from Lange about the blood tests because the final test results had not been given to the defense. The judge said he was considering telling the jury to ignore Lange's testimony about the fingernail blood.</P>

<P>He also said the mystery ice cream cup found in Nicole Simpson's house contained Ben & Jerry's chocolate chip cookie dough and that police tests indicated that this ice cream never looks completely melted because of the dough.</P>

<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P><B>MARCH 8</B> - Judge Lance Ito ruled the defense could see some edited versions of police documents relating to internal investigations of detective Mark Fuhrman.</P>

<P>In his ruling, the judge said the defense could review interviews with at least 14 police officers who were at the crime scene. They were apparently questioned about whether Fuhrman could have moved a bloody glove from Nicole Brown Simpson's condominium. The defense has claimed that Fuhrman planted a bloody glove on O.J. Simpson's estate.</P>

<P>The judge also ruled the defense could see documents relating to an investigation on whether Fuhrman commented on Nicole Simpson's breasts. Judge Ito refused to let the defense see papers linked to allegations Fuhrman had Nazi paraphernalia at his desk.</P>

<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P><B>MARCH 9</B> - Detective Mark Fuhrman took the witness stand and denied knowing or meeting a woman who claims he made racist comments to her.</P>

<P>Prosecutor Marcia Clark immediately asked Fuhrman about defense allegations that he is a racist who may have planted the incriminating bloody glove on O.J. Simpson's property.</P>

<P>Clark started her questioning by asking Fuhrman how he felt about testifying. He replied, "nervous, reluctant."</P>

<P>When asked why, Fuhrman said, "throughout, since June 13, it seems I've seen a lot of the evidence ignored and a lot of personal issues come to the forefront. I think that's too bad."</P>

<P>Fuhrman then testified that he never met Kathleen Bell in 1985 or 1986. Bell, a real estate agent, has said she met Fuhrman at a Marine recruiting office and that he told her he hated blacks and that when he saw a black man in a car with a white woman he would always find an excuse to pull them over. </P>

<P>Fuhrman also described a 1985 incident during which he responded to a family dispute call at Simpson's Brentwood mansion. </P>

<P>He said he and his partner responded to the call and found Simpson in the driveway of his home, with a woman leaning on a car sobbing into her hands. Fuhrman said he did not see the woman's face, but earlier testimony indicated that woman was Nicole Brown Simpson. She had called police to the house because Simpson had smashed the windshield of her Mercedes with a baseball bat. </P>

<P>Before Fuhrman started his testimony, Ronald Goldman's stepmother, Patti Goldman, testified. She said she wrote the grocery shopping list found in a bag with her late stepson's clothes. The defense had implied that Goldman wrote the list and that the seal from a banana found at the murder scene may have been from a banana on that list. </P>

<P>But Patti Goldman said the grocery bag that police put her stepson's clothing in after his death was from her house and contained a shopping list she had thrown into the bag.</P>

<P>She testified after detective Tom Lange wrapped up eight days of testimony by saying the Simpson investigation was international in scope and involved interviews with 170 witnesses. </P>

<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P><B>MARCH 10</B> - The week ended with prosecutors introducing into evidence a shovel, a towel and a large, heavy-duty plastic bag found in O.J. Simpson's Bronco.</P>

<P>Detective Mark Fuhrman testified that he found the items and the blood on the car when he arrived at Simpson's home several hours after the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman.</P>

<P>Deputy District Attorney Marcia Clark did not explain why the items were being introduced, but she may have been laying groundwork for a suggestion of premeditation on the part of Simpson.</P>

<P>Fuhrman then displayed the evidence for the jury. During his second day of testimony, Fuhrman described his actions at the crime scene and the decision to drive to Simpson's home and to subsequently climb the wall onto the property.</P>

<P>Furhman said detective Ron Phillips asked him to lead the investigators to Simpson's home. Once there, the officers tried for 35 minutes to get someone to answer their calls, Furhrman said. He then described how he wandered away from the others and spotted what he believed to be blood on the door and frame of Simpson's Bronco parked around the corner from the residence's main gate.</P>

<P>"We had previously discussed our concerns with another possible victim, or a kidnap-type robbery, murder-suicide," Fuhrman said. "We had no idea what we were confronted with at that point."</P>

<P>Prosecutors and police have argued that they entered Simpson's home that morning because they feared he or someone else might be injured inside.</P>

<P>Fuhrman said detective Philip Vannatter made the final decision to enter Simpson's home without a warrant. "There was a question how we were going to go in and I suggested, 'Do you want me to go over the wall?' " he said.</P>

<H2>Week by Week in the O.J. Simpson Criminal Trial</H2>

<H3>Week 8 (March 13 - 17, 1995)</H3>

<P><B>MARCH 13</B> - Defense attorney F. Lee Bailey set out to portray detective Mark Fuhrman as a racist cop who planted a bloody glove on O.J. Simpson's property in order to advance his career.</P>

<P>Fuhrman "is very definitely a suspect" in such misconduct, Bailey told Judge Lance Ito during a hearing outside the jury's presence. "And that's what we intend to show with circumstantial evidence far stronger than the people will ever offer against O.J. Simpson for the murders."</P>

<P>The prosecution insists the defense does not have any evidence to support its claims. Prosecutor Marcia Clark said the defense "has never and will never be able to demonstrate either the opportunity or give any kind of real offer of proof to this court that detective Fuhrman planted anything."</P>

<P>During his cross-examination, Bailey implied that the defense would present witnesses to contradict Fuhrman's testimony that he never met or knew a woman named Kathleen Bell. She has claimed that she heard Fuhrman make racist remarks.</P>

<P>Fuhrman testified that he had visited the recruiting station in 1985, but had never met Bell or a woman named Andrea Terry. Bell worked in a real estate office above the recruiting station.</P>

<P>"If an Andrea Terry were to testify that she was with you in Hennessy's Tavern with Kathleen Bell and heard remarks such as the ones you've seen, you would say this is a fabrication?" Bailey asked. "I don't know why she would do it, but yes I would," Fuhrman replied.</P>

<P>But Fuhrman eventually conceded that a woman who worked upstairs had come through the office while he was there.</P>

<P>"Describe the woman that you did see," Bailey asked.</P>

<P>"I couldn't," Fuhrman said.</P>

<P>"Blond, brunette, redhead?" Bailey pressed. "Short, tall, stout, slim?"</P>

<P>"I paid no attention," Fuhrman insisted.</P>

<P>"Are you now saying, sir, that if you have ever seen Kathleen Bell, you didn't recognize her, but she may have walked through that place without your knowledge? Is that your present posture?" Bailey asked.</P>

<P>"Well, she could have," Fuhrman said. "I'm not sure."</P>

<P>Bailey also suggested that Fuhrman's account would be contradicted by Marine Corps Sgt. Joseph Foss, with whom Fuhrman spoke several times at the office.</P>

<P>Bailey then meticulously questioned Fuhrman about his actions on June 13 in an effort to show that Fuhrman had the time and opportunity to frame Simpson.</P>

<P>Bailey tried to show that Fuhrman was alone looking at Ron Goldman's body at about 3:30 am -- giving him the time to pick up the left-hand glove. Fuhrman said he stayed at the body only long enough to look at Goldman's wounds.</P>

<P>Fuhrman also acknowledged that he spent about 10 minutes alone on the path outside Simpson's estate where he said he found the right-hand glove.</P>

<P>Bailey then asked Fuhrman about the blood drop he said he spotted on a door handle of Simpson's Bronco. Bailey asked Fuhrman if he knew there was blood in the Bronco. Fuhrman said he was not sure. And then out of nowhere, Bailey asked, "did you wipe a glove in the Bronco, Detective Fuhrman?" </P>

<P>Fuhrman smiled and said "no."</P>

<P>Bailey suggested that Fuhrman was upset by losing the case to the robbery/homicide detectives and decided to become an indispensable witness by planting the evidence.</P>

<P>"I was disappointed in losing a case that looked very interesting and very complex," Fuhrman said.</P>

<P>"Weren't you a fellow that had spent a good part of his career waiting for an opportunity to make, quote, the big arrest?" Bailey said at another point, suggesting that Fuhrman might have planted evidence to advance his career.</P>

<P>"No," Fuhrman said.</P>

<P>Earlier in the day, defense lawyers argued that Clark's decision to introduce Bell's affidavit opened the door for them to question Fuhrman more broadly about his racial attitudes, including episodes that Judge Ito had earlier ruled inadmissible. The judge stood by his original decision.</P>

<P>Prior to the start of cross-examination, Fuhrman testified how he found the bloody glove. Fuhrman said he stepped out of Simpson's house to the front yard, heading south around the garage, then eastward down the walkway toward the point where Brian "Kato" Kaelin had said he heard thumps several hours earlier.</P>

<P>"When I got approximately 15-20 feet away, I saw a dark object and I continued walking toward that object," he said, pointing to a poster marked "Glove Found at Rear of 360 N. Rockingham Ave. "At some point you could tell that it was a glove."</P>

<P>Fuhrman told prosecutor Clark that he approached the glove but did not touch it. The glove, he said, was dark leather and appeared to be moist and sticky. "It looked similar to the glove on the Bundy scene," he said.</P>

<P>The direct examination began with an embarrassing moment for the prosecution as Fuhrman acknowledged that the large plastic bag he found in the Bronco - and was displayed for the jury Friday - was standard equipment in the Bronco for carrying spare tires.</P>

<P>Meanwhile, Court TV learned that Mary Ann Gerchas is no longer on the defense witness list. Defense lawyer Johnnie Cochran said in his opening statement that Gerchas would testify to seeing four men near Nicole Brown Simpson's home at about 10:45 pm on the night of the murders. The prosecution has called Gerchas a lair and she was recently arrested for allegedly failing to pay thousands of dollars in hotel bills.</P>

<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P><B>MARCH 14</B> - Judge Lance Ito ruled the defense could introduce new allegations that Detective Mark Fuhrman once called a black Marine a "nigger." </P>

<P>Famed defense lawyer F. Lee Bailey said Marine Sgt. Max Cordoba would testify that Fuhrman uttered the racial slur at a Marine recruiting office in 1985. Judge Ito ruled that Bailey could ask the detective about Cordoba's allegations after prosecutors have a chance to interview him. </P>

<P>With the jury absent from the courtroom, Bailey told Ito that Cordoba was at the recruiting center in 1985 when Fuhrman came in to apply to join a Marine reserve unit. Cordoba turned to another sergeant who was handling Fuhrman's application and said, "Your boy is here," Bailey said.</P>

<P>"And Fuhrman turns on Cordova and says, 'Let's get something straight. The only boy here is you, nigger,'" Bailey said. "And then Cordova leaves the building and Fuhrman follows him out into the parking lot and repeats the same epithet." </P>

<P>In arguing against allowing the jury to hear about the incident, prosecutor Marcia Clark said, "these allegations get more outrageous by the minute."</P>

<P>Ito also said he would allow testimony by a woman named Andrea Terry. The defense says Terry can corroborate Kathleen Bell's claims that she heard Fuhrman make racist remarks in 1985 or 1986.</P>

<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P><B>MARCH 15</B> - Defense lawyer F. Lee Bailey and prosecutor Marcia Clark engaged in a bitter exchange over defense allegations that Detective Mark Fuhrman uttered racial epithets to a black Marine sergeant.</P>

<P>The dispute centered around Bailey's claims on Tuesday that Maximo Cordoba would testify that Fuhrman called him a "nigger." Bailey told the court that he had spoken "Marine to Marine" with Cordoba.</P>

<P>But Cordoba told a television show Tuesday night that he never spoke to Bailey. That comment prompted Clark to call Bailey a liar during arguments before Judge Lance Ito.</P>

<P>The judge declined to let the defense immediately question Fuhrman about Cordoba. Judge Ito also barred the defense from questioning Fuhrman about whether he showed racist behavior while interviewing the victim of a carjacking. He said the defense had not presented proof that the incident was relevant in the Simpson trial.</P>

<P>Once testimony began, Fuhrman again denied ever making racial slurs.</P>

<P>"You say under oath that you have not addressed any black person as a nigger or spoken about black people as niggers in the past ten years, Detective Fuhrman?" Bailey asked.</P>

<P>"That's what I'm saying, sir," responded Fuhrman.</P>

<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P><B>MARCH 16</B> - Detective Mark Fuhrman ended five days on the witness stand. and two other police investigators testified that Fuhrman never had an opportunity to take a glove from the murder scene in order to plant it on a narrow walk way behind O.J. Simpson's home.</P>

<P>Before ending his testimony, Fuhrman was asked by defense lawyer F. Lee Bailey about a psychiatrist he had met in the District Attorney's office. The defense suspects that psychiatrist Mark Goulson, a friend of Los Angeles District Attorney Gil Garcetti, had helped Fuhrman prepare for his testimony. Fuhrman testified that the only thing Goulston, who was in court for two days of Fuhrman's testimony, said to him was "good job, keep it up."</P>

<P>On redirect, Prosecutor Marcia Clark asked Fuhrman a few questions to determine his state of mind when he was at Simpson's estate. Fuhrman said that at the time he found the glove, he did not know the time of the murders, whether Simpson had an alibi, whether there were any witnesses or that fibers would be found in Simpson's Bronco. Clark was trying to show that Fuhrman did not know enough about the murders to frame Simpsoin.</P>

<P>Fuhrman was followed to the stand by Lt. Frank Spangler, commander of the west Los Angeles station. Spangler testified that he never saw Fuhrman alone near the bloody glove found near Ronald Goldman's body and never saw more than one glove at the crime scene.</P>

<P>Detective Philip Vannatter, the lead investigator in the case, testified that Fuhrman led him to a bloody glove he said he had found on a walkway behind Simpson's mansion. Vannatter said it was his decision, and not Fuhrman's, that they should go on to Simpson's estate when there was no response from inside the house to a buzzer at the gate to the estate.</P>

<P>Vannatter said he was concerned that someone on the premises might be hurt because he had just left an "extremely bloody murder scene," and he had seen what appeared to be blood on Simpson's white Ford Bronco which was parked on the street. He said Fuhrman was asked to climb over the wall into the estate because he was the youngest, fittest and most junior ranking of the four investigating detectives.</P>

<P><B>MARCH 17</B> - The jury underwent its fifth change when Judge Lance Ito dismissed a 52-year-old Amtrak manager and replaced him with a 60-year-old woman.</P>

<P>The jury is now composed of nine women and three men. There are eight blacks, three whites and one Hispanic.</P>

<P>The dwindling alternate pool now consists of six women and one man.</P>

<P>The judge did not give a reason for the panelist's removal, but the juror was suspected to be writing a book. His hotel room was searched and a laptop computer was found.</P>

<P>When testimony resumed, Detective Philip Vannatter described finding eight blood drops at Simpson's home between the Ford Bronco and the main entrance. Vannatter also said he found two more blood drops in the foyer. </P>

<H2>Week by Week in the O.J. Simpson Criminal Trial</H2>

<H3>Week 9 (March 20 - 24, 1995)</H3>

<P><B>MARCH 20</B> - O.J. Simpson showed the jury his left middle finger which the prosecution claims he injured during the slayings of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman.</P>

<P>Defense attorney Robert Shapiro suggested that Simpson's finger was permanently swollen due to arthritis, and had not been temporarily swollen because of a cut. </P>

<P>Simpson had told police that he cut his hand on a glass in his Chicago hotel room after learning of the murders. Detective Philip Vannatter previously testified that Simpson's hand was cut and swollen when he examined it on June 13, a day after the murders. He said the injuries were part of the reason for suspecting Simpson in the murders.</P>

<P>During his questioning of Vannatter, Shapiro suggested that Simpson's knuckle always was "swollen due to a medical condition and not any laceration."</P>

<P>Shapiro asked Vannatter, then jurors, to look at Simpson's finger and compare it with a police photograph taken after the killings.</P>

<P>Vannatter stepped down from the witness stand, took a quick look at Simpson's finger and offered a quick assessment: "Didn't appear swollen to me."</P>

<P>It was the second time since the trial started that Simpson walked over to the jury. During opening statements, he displayed his scarred knee as his lawyers argued that he was not physically capable of carrying out the murders.</P>

<P>Before the cross-examination, Deputy District Attorney Christopher Darden concluded his questioning of Vannatter. </P>

<P>"Did you rush to judgment in this case?" Darden asked.</P>

<P>"No," Vannatter said, adding that police gathered more than 450 pieces of evidence were gathered.</P>

<P>In an effort to answer suggestions that Vannatter or someone else planted blood at Simpson's estate, the detective explained how he handled a vial of Simpson's blood after it was drawn the afternoon following the murders.</P>

<P>Vannatter said he took the blood personally to a criminalist at Simpson's home, where a search warrant was being served. By the time he arrived, Vannatter said, blood found at the house had already been identified and the bloody Bronco had been impounded.</P>

<P>Darden then showed the jury news footage from June 13, the day Simpson returned to his home from Chicago. The footage, he said, illustrated that Simpson was treated fairly. The video showed Simpson at first handcuffed, then without handcuffs after a discussion with Vannatter. </P>

<P>Vannatter told the jury Friday how Simpson spent about three hours at police headquarters on the afternoon of June 13. The interview was not played for the jury Monday.</P>

<P>Vannatter testified that the drive from Simpson's home to the crime scene takes about five minutes. Prosecutors showed jurors a laser disc recording, accompanied by a map, in which Vannatter times his drive between the Bundy crime scene and Simpson's home. He made the drive Sept. 25, driving at 35 mph and obeying traffic laws.</P>

<P>During his questioning, Shapiro tried to portray Vannatter as an aging detective out of touch with modern investigative techniques.</P>

<P>Shapiro suggested that the police work was sloppy, particularly in the first few hours after the bodies were discovered. He asked why two experienced detectives stood around at the Bundy Drive crime scene for an hour waiting for Vannatter and his partner Detective Tom Lange to arrive and take over the case rather than looking for suspects in the slayings.</P>

<P>Vannatter said that other uniformed officers were out knocking on doors for leads.</P>

<P>Shapiro also questioned Vannatter on the detective's actions at Simpson's home. Vannatter, like other detectives who testified before him, stated that he and three other detectives went to Rockingham Avenue to inform Simpson of the death. Shapiro asked whether any of the more than 25 other officers at the crime scene could have notified Simpson while the detectives conducted their investigation.</P>

<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P><B>MARCH 21</B> - O.J. Simpson's former houseguest Brian "Kato" Kaelin took the witness stand after the defense concluded its cross-examination of Detective Philip Vannatter, the lead investigator in the case.</P>

<P>Vannatter tried to explain two of the mysteries in the case: why there was no cut on the glove found at the murder scene and why there was no blood on the glove found on Simpson's property.</P>

<P>Under questioning by defense attorney Robert Shapiro, Vannatter also acknowledged he misstated several facts when he obtained a warrant to search Simpson's estate.</P>

<P>In other developments:</P>

<P>Judge Lance Ito denied a defense request to show the jurors the knife contained in the "mystery envelope" during Vannatter's testimony. It was revealed that the knife was found in Simpson's master bedroom but is not the murder weapon. The defense will argue that the failure of the police to find the knife reflected their sloppiness in investigating the case. </P>

<P>Simpson's lawyers renewed their attack on DNA evidence, asking for an admissibility hearing on all test results submitted since they abandoned their pretrial challenge of such evidence. The defense said its decision in January to waive a hearing on the admissibility of DNA evidence applied only to results known at the time.</P>

<P>"It would be unfair to force a defendant to decide whether and how to challenge DNA evidence before knowing about that (upcoming) evidence," the defense motion said. "It would be particularly unfair to hold that a defendant's 'waiver' with respect to one set of DNA evidence ... is binding with respect to later-disclosed items of DNA evidence."</P>

<P>The motion didn't specify which test results the defense wants to challenge. But prosecutors have disclosed that one recent test showed a match between Simpson's blood and blood found on a gate at the crime scene.</P>

<P>Inside the court, Kaelin displayed the colorful style that has made him a minor celebrity in the case.</P>

<P>When Deputy District Attorney Marcia Clark asked him if he was nervous, he blurted out, "feeling great," sparking laughter in the courtroom. He then said he was "a little" nervous.</P>

<P>He testified that Simpson told him that he had given up attempts to reconcile with Nicole Brown Simpson but that he didn't want his girlfriend, Paula Barbieri, to go with him to his daughter's dance recital on June 12.</P>

<P>"I think she wanted to go ... and O.J. just wanted to make it kind of a family thing," Kaelin said. "I think she was upset that she wasn't going to go."</P>

<P>He described how he met Nicole Brown Simpson in Aspen, Colorado in December 1992, and then moved into her guest house in January 1993. He testified that they were just friends and that he was planning to relocate to the condominium she purchased and moved into in January 1994. Instead, he moved to Simpson's guest house.</P>

<P>When Clark suggested that he moved into Simpson's guest house to boost his budding acting career, Kaelin quipped, "I don't think we were going for the same parts."</P>

<P>Kaelin's testimony came after the defense questioned Vannatter about the "reckless" misstatements the detective made to obtain a search warrant for Simpson's estate.</P>

<P>Judge Ito said the defense could question Vannatter on two statements in a search warrant affidavit: that human blood was found on the Bronco parked outside Simpson's house and that Simpson had taken an "unexpected" flight to Chicago the night of the murders. Vannatter admitted that there were problems with the affidavit. But he said the inconsistencies were not deliberate.</P>

<P>During his questioning, Shapiro tried to show that Vannatter, a 26-year police department veteran, conducted a sloppy investigation and that he is out of touch with modern police techniques.</P>

<P>The defense tried to show that if Simpson dropped the glove on his property and was bleeding at the time, then there should have been blood drops on the property. </P>

<P>"How much blood was found?" Shapiro asked. </P>

<P>"None, none that I'm aware of," Vannatter replied. He also said there wasn't any blood on the wire fence or the adjacent property.</P>

<P>The prosecution has never explained how or when Simpson could have been along the walkway where the glove was found if the drops of blood led from the Ford Bronco outside him home into the foyer inside.</P>

<P>District Attorney Christopher Darden offered the explanation that the area where the glove was found was so overgrown that blood could not be spotted. He asked Vannatter whether police picked up and examined every leaf for blood. Vannatter said they did not.</P>

<P>Darden then asked whether it was possible that the person carrying the glove had put his bleeding finger in his pocket to cover his trail. The defense objected and the question was not answered.</P>

<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P><B>MARCH 22</B> - Brian "Kato" Kaelin described his evening with O.J. Simpson in the hours before the murder and described the three loud thumps he heard against the wall of his room that prosecutors believe were made by Simpson as he dropped a glove in an alleyway.</P>

<P>Kaelin appeared much more at ease on the witness stand than he did Tuesday although he seemed at times to be struggling with wanting to tell the truth while not harming Simpson.</P>

<P>"You consider yourself the defendant's friend, don't you, Mr. Kaelin?" Deputy District Attorney Marcia Clark said in an aggressive tone. </P>

<P>"Yes," Kaelin answered, adding, "I'm still a friend. I'm -- I know my job is to be 100 percent honest and that's what I'm going to do."</P>

<P>The most dramatic moment of the day came when Kaelin thumped a table in front of the witness stand with a clenched fist to demonstrate the noises he heard at about 10:45 pm on the night of the murders.</P>

<P>During her questioning, Clark guided Kaelin throught the events of June 12 beginning with a conversation he had with Simpson after Simpson returned from his daughter Sydney's dance retital.</P>

<P>Kaelin said Simpson told him that Nicole Brown Simpson did not allow him to spend time with his daughter. Although Simpson seemed upset by the incident, Kaelin said he did not seem angry about it.</P>

<P>Kaelin also said Simpson told him that his relationship with his former wife was over. He also said that Simpson complained of the tight dress Nicole Simpson was wearing at the recital.</P>

<P>Later in the evening, Kaelin said, he and Simpson went to McDonald's and returned to Simpson's estate at about 9:40 pm. Kaelin said he went to his room and made some phone calls, including one to his friend, Rachel Ferrara. During the call, Kaelin said he heard the three thumps sometime between 10:40 pm and 10:45 pm.</P>

<P>Kaelin said that after hearing the thumps he intended to explore the narrow pathway alongside his room where the sounds came from, but admitted he was "scared" at the prospect of going out to the walkway with only a small flashlight.</P>

<P>He eventually left the house but did not investigate the noises because his attention was distracted by a limousine waiting at one of the gates to Simpson's estate to take Simpson to the airport for a flight to Chicago.</P>

<P>He said Simpson subsequently came out of the house and he helped him load his luggage into the limousine. But there was one item, a black knapsack, that Simpson insisted on placing in the trunk personally. The prosecution suspects the bag contained bloody clothes or possibly a weapon. </P>

<P>Clark repeatedly asked Kaelin whether he saw any injuries on Simpson's hands during the evening prior to the murder. Kaelin said he did not. The prosecution believes the cuts on the middle finger of Simpson's left hand that police saw on June 13 were suffered during the fatal attack on Ronald Goldman.</P>

<P>In another development, prosecutors filed a motion seeking to show the jury autopsy photos of the victims.</P>

<P>The prosecution said the photos are "far less startling" than the crime scene pictures that the jury has already seen.</P>

<P>"The autopsy photographs clearly depicting the stab wounds and other injuries . . . will be particularly probative to establish that one person and one knife could have caused this carnage," the motion said.</P>

<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P><B>MARCH 23</B> - The prosecution concluded its direct examination of Brian "Kato" Kaelin, with Marcia Clark pressing him about his reasons for not moving in with Nicole Brown Simpson at her condominium.</P>

<P>The intense questioning was aimed at portraying Simpson as a possessive ex-husband who would do almost anything to keep men away from his former wife.</P>

<P>Kaelin testified that Simpson had told him it "wasn't right" that Kaelin live under the same roof with Nicole Simpson while the two were trying to reconcile. But Clark tried to get Kaelin to admit that Simpson was really worried about a possible sexual relationship between Kaelin and Nicole Simpson. </P>

<P>Kaelin previously testified that he planned to move into a room in Nicole Simpson's condominium that she purchased in Janaury 1994.</P>

<P>"Did she try to get you to move out of (Simpson's estate on) Rockingham?" Clark asked.</P>

<P>"Yes," he said.</P>

<P>When Clark again asked him why didn't move, Kaelin said, Simpson "didn't say, because of having romance with her. That didn't come up like that because I think it was a given that I wasn't. But he was saying it wasn't right for you to be, a man-to-man thing, where you are going to be in the same house with his children and Nicole. They're trying to work things out, so, I moved out."</P>

<P>Clark countered: "And he never said 'I don't like the idea of a man living under the same roof with Nicole?' He never said that?"</P>

<P>"That it wasn't right for me, to be in the same house, a man, in that same house with Nicole and the children," he said.</P>

<P>"What did you take that to mean, Mr. Kaelin?" Clark asked again.</P>

<P>"That it could possibly have been that he was thinking that I might be with Nicole," Kaelin said.</P>

<P>"Sexually?" Clark asked.</P>

<P>"Possibly, that he was thinking that, yes," Kaelin said.</P>

<P>Clark also asked a short series of questions to reiterate that Kaelin did not see Simpson from the time the two returned from McDonald's at 9:37 pm on June 12 until 11 pm when he saw Simpson getting into the limousine for the ride to the airport.</P>

<P><B>MARCH 24</B> - The court was in recess.</P>

<H2>Week by Week in the O.J. Simpson Criminal Trial</H2>

<H3>Week 10 (March 27 - 31, 1995)</H3>

<P><B>MARCH 27</B> - The prosecution was granted permission to treat Brian "Kato" Kaelin as a hostile witness. The decision allowed Deputy District Attorney Marcia Clark to more aggressively question her own witness.</P>

<P>Kaelin then testified that Simpson was upset in the hours before Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman, were stabbed to death. He had said earlier that Simpson appeared "normal" on the evening of June 12, but changed his testimony to say Simpson was "upset" over an incident with his daughter, Sydney, following a dance recital in which she had taken part. </P>

<P>Kaelin said Simpson was also "a little bit upset" over his ex-wife wearing a tight dress to the recital. He said Simpson told him he had wanted to spend time with his daughter after the recital but Nicole Simpson had allowed him to see her only briefly before leaving to have dinner with friends. </P>

<P>Kaelin also testified that Simpson tried to help him get a role in a feature film, contradicting his earlier testimony that Simpson didn't assist in the aspiring actor's career. He said that in May 1994, Simpson called a friend in an effort to get Kaelin a part on the film "Outpost." Kaelin insisted the audition was scheduled even before the call was made and he didn't get the part.</P>

<P>When asked by defense attorney Robert Shapiro what he meant in describing Simpson as upset, Kaelin said Simpson was sad but not angry or agitated. He also testified that he did not notice anything unusual about Simpson's behavior when he saw him at 9:35 pm on the night of June 12, and again at 11 pm as Simpson was getting ready for the limousine ride to the airport.</P>

<P>The day also was highlighted by a prosecution suggestion that Simpson argued with his ex-wife during a telephone call on the day she was killed. </P>

<P>The revelation came when Clark asked Kaelin whether he knew if Simpson had an argument with Nicole Simpson during a cellular phone call from the Riviera Country Club on June 12. The defense immediately objected to the question. The attorneys then huddled at a sidebar with Judge Lance Ito. </P>

<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P><B>MARCH 28</B> - Brian "Kato" Kaelin wrapped up five days of testimony, insisting that even though he felt some obligation to O.J. Simpson, he wouldn't lie on the witness stand.</P>

<P>Kaelin was excused, although the judge said he was subject to recall. The next witness was Rachel Ferrara, who was on the telephone with Kaelin the night of June 12, when he heard three thumping noises outside his room. She was followed by Allan Park, the limousine driver who took Simpson to the airport on the night of June 12. </P>

<P>Meanwhile, telephone records show Simpson spoke with Nicole Brown Simpson on the day of the murders. Deputy District Attorney Marcia Clark, during a sidebar discussion at Simpson's murder trial Monday, revealed that cellular phone records indicate a call was made from Simpson's phone to Nicole Simpson's house at 2:18 pm, while Simpson was at the Riviera Country Club. Simpson golfed and played gin rummy there that day. A woman at the country club will be called to testify about the four-minute phone call, Clark said, according to a transcript of the conversation.</P>

<P>"We have a witness who observed him on the cell phone angry, yelling," Clark told the judge and defense attorneys outside the jury's presence.</P>

<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P><B>MARCH 29</B> - Testimony focused on O.J. Simpson's luggage with conflicting testimony about how many bags he took on his trip to Chicago.</P>

<P>And, the prosecution said they had new evidence about what happened to the mystery black bag in which they claim Simpson carried bloody clothes after committing the murders.</P>

<P>Deputy District Attorney Christopher Darden made the comment in the absence of the jury, telling Judge Lance Ito, "We hope to present more evidence relative to what happened to the bag in which the bloody clothes were carried." </P>

<P>The prosecution believes that Simpson stashed bloody clothes and a knife inside a small knapsack he carried out of his house. The bag wasn't seen again when Simpson checked his luggage at the airport. The suspicion is that Simpson stuffed the knapsack inside a larger bag.</P>

<P>Limousine driver Allan Park said he saw five bags when he picked up Simpson for the trip to the airport. He said a Louis Vitton garment bag and golf bag were placed in the trunk of the limousine and that Simpson took two duffel bags into the passenger area. He also said he saw Simpson pick up a knapsack but did not see him take it with him.</P>

<P>Park said he unloaded the garment bag and the golf bag at the airport but didn't see the knapsack. He said he saw Simpson with the two duffel bags.</P>

<P>James Williams, a skycap who checked in Simpson's luggage at the airport, said Simpson only checked the garment bag and golf bag, and that he saw Simpson with one duffel bag.</P>

<P>The mystery of the bags continued at the airport. Park said he saw Simpson briefly set the golf bag on top of a Los Angeles airport trash can. And when defense attorney Carl Douglas asked Williams on cross-examination, "You didn't see Mr. Simpson doing anything near the trash can," he answered: "Yes, he was standing near the trash can." </P>

<P>Park also was questioned about the whereabouts of Simpson's Bronco.</P>

<P>During cross-examination by defense attorney Johnnie Cochran, Park said he could not be absolutely sure that the Bronco was gone when he arrived at the estate. </P>

<P>But when questioned again by prosecutor Marcia Clark, Park reiterated his earlier testimony, saying he did not see the Bronco as he scanned curb numbers in front of Simpson's home at 10:22 pm nor 17 minutes later when he drove around to another entrance.</P>

<P>Park also told Cochran that he did not see any blood drops in the driveway or any cut on Simpson's left hand. But on redirect examination, he clarified the point by saying he was not paying close attention to Simpson's hands. He said he shook Simpson's right hand, not the left.</P>

<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P><B>MARCH 30</B> - The prosecution revealed a surprise witness who saw O.J. Simpson possible throw something into the trash at the airport shortly before catching a plane to Chicago.</P>

<P>Prosecutor Marcia Clark said she intends to produce the witness, who has only recently come forward, in an attempt to solve the mystery of the bloody clothes.</P>

<P>The revelation was made during a closed door conference between the lawyers on Wednesday. Clark said the witness saw Simpson standing by the trash can while checking his luggage. </P>

<P>"This witness will state that he saw Mr. Simpson reach down, then reach back up and go into his bag and zip it up," Clark said. The implication is that Simpson took something out of his bag and put it in the trash. </P>

<P>Meanwhile, an employee of a security firm started to testify about security procedures at O.J. Simpson's home. Susan Silva testified Simpson has to use the front door to enter his home without triggering an alarm. She said the alarm did not go off on June 12.</P>

<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P><B>MARCH 31</B> - The day's testimony once again focused on whether O.J. Simpson's Ford Bronco was parked at his estate at the time of the murders.</P>

<P>Charles Cale, a neighbor who lives within one-quarter mile of Simpson's home, testified that he did not see the vehicle when he walked his dog around the Simpson estate between 9:30 and 9:45 pm on June 12. He further testified that on June 13, at around 7am, he noticed the Bronco parked on Rockingham at a weird angle.</P>

<P>Cale's testimony was consistent was consistent with the previous testimony of Brian Kaelin and limousine driver Allan Park. Kaelin said he and Simpson returned from McDonald's at about 9:35pm. Park said he did not see the Bronco when he arrived at the estate at about 10:22 pm.</P>

<P>During cross-examination, defense lawyer Robert Shapiro tried to show that Cale was inexact about the times and that he was set up by the prosecution to come forward to bolster its case. However, Cale, who has nothing to gain from his testimony, stated that he did not realize the position of the Bronco was important to the case until January. He also explained that he noticed the Bronco because cars were rarely, if ever, parked on Rockingham.</P>

<H2>Week by Week in the O.J. Simpson Criminal Trial</H2>

<H3>Week 11 (April 3 - 7, 1995)</H3>

<P><B>APRIL 3</B> - The next phase of the trial began as prosecutors started to present the scientific evidence that they say links O.J. Simpson to the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman.</P>

<P>Criminalist Dennis Fung started testifying about the painstaking process of collecting blood stains and other evidence. He explained for the jury how the evidence is collected, catalogued and stored.</P>

<P>The prosecution has said that DNA evidence ties Simpson to the murders. The evidence includes blood stains in Simpson's Bronco and on a pair of socks in his bedroom. Prosecutors say the stains match the blood of Nicole Simpson. They also say tests found blood from Goldman in the Bronco and on the glove found beside Simpson's house.</P>

<P>The defense is expected to challenge the reliability of the evidence.</P>

<P>Meanwhile, prosecutor Marcia Clark denied knowing anything about a police videotape taken at Simpson's estate the day after the murders. She said the first time she ever saw the video photographer was last week when he testified in court about the videotape.</P>

<P>"I didn't even know they were doing that," said Clark, adding that if she had known about a videotape, she would have been "delighted" because she could have used it as part of her case.</P>

<P>Police testified the videotape was put into a drawer and forgotten. Police officers testified the tape had nothing to do with the criminal investigation of the murders. Instead it was to protect authorities from  potential civil claims for property damage or loss.</P>

<P>"I have before me a defendant's request for sanctions including monetary sanctions," Judge Lance Ito said before scheduling arguments on the motion for Tuesday.</P>

<P>Defense attorney Johnnie Cochran Jr. asked to call Clark as a witness, but Judge Ito said that was unnecessary and she could address him as an officer of the court.</P>

<P>At one point during the hearing, the judge told the lawyers to focus on several questions regarding the videotape. </P>

<P>"All I'm interested in is: What happened to the tape? Why did it disappear? When did it come to light? How did it come to light? Who knew it existed, and when?" the judge said.</P>

<P>Detective Adalberto Luper testified that he took possession of the tape from a videographer on June 14, put it in a desk drawer and then a Simpson case file cabinet and did not remember it until February. He said he located the tape in March and then the discovery was reported to the city attorney's office, whose lawyers are the Police Department's legal counsel.</P>

<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P><B>APRIL 4</B> - Criminalist Dennis Fung testified about the series of blood and other stains recovered from O.J. Simpson's Bronco on June 14, two days after the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman.</P>

<P>Fung detailed for the jury how he collected the evidence from the car's steering wheel, carpet, instrument panel and a console. </P>

<P>Meanwhile, Judge Lance Ito annnounced a step that he hopes will speed up the trial. He said that the legal wrangling over motions and other issues - outside of the presence of the jury - will take place at the end of testimony each day.</P>

<P>The judge also issued sanctions against prosecutors. He told jurors that the prosecution had wrongfully mentioned an airline ticket and a luggage tag unlawfully seized by police at Simpson's home. He told the jury to disregard the statements. He also ordered prosecutors to prepare an inventory of every videotape relevant to the case in their possession, or in the possession of police or any other agency. The decision came after the defense complained that a police videotape made on June 13 had been withheld until March 28.</P>

<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P><B>APRIL 5</B> - Criminalist Dennis Fung conceded that investigators made mistakes at the murder scene that had possibly contaminated some crucial physical evidence in the case.</P>

<P>Fung made the admissions during a grueling cross-examination by defense attorney Barry Scheck. Scheck's questioning focused on how evidence was collected at the murder scene and from O.J. Simpson's estate.</P>

<P>Meanwhile, a sixth juror was dismissed, leaving only six remaining alternates for the trial that still has months to go. </P>

<P>Judge Lance Ito removed a 38-year-old black woman who works as an employment interviewer and lives in Inglewood. It is believed that she had a past experience with domestic violence that she failed to report during jury selection. She was replaced on the jury by a 44-year-old black woman from South Central Los Angeles. She is employed as a computer technician.</P>

<P>The latest change does not alter the ethnic makeup of the jury. It has nine women and three men; eight are black, three white and one Hispanic. </P>

<P>In a television interview, the juror, Jeanette Harris, said she believes the trial will end in a hung jury. "The prosecution to me, from what I've seen so far, is just spinning wheels," she said. "They're not necessarily saying anything, but they're saying a whole lot of nothing."</P>

<P>Scheck questioned Fung on a number of topics. For instance, he asked why Simpson's Bronco was not sealed off with the usual crime scene tape. He also asked why a second criminalist was not assigned to the case - one for the Bundy scene and one for Rockingham. Fung said he asked Detective Philip Vannatter for a second team but that Vannatter said it wasn't necessary. Fung then testified that he thought it was better to have only one team of criminalists to maintain a single chain of custody of the evidence.</P>

<P>In trying to show that mistakes resulted in the contamination of evidence, Scheck focused on a blanket that was used to cover Nicole Brown Simpson's body.</P>

<P>Scheck asked whether the blanket could have carried hairs or fibers that could have been transferred to the victims when the blanket was spread out over the crime scene. The defense suggested that Simpson could have left one of his hairs on the blanket while at Nicole Simpson's home.</P>

<P>When asked if it was a "terrible mistake" for a detective to use the blanket, Fung said it would depend on how clean it was.</P>

<P>"Well, if you had no idea how clean the blanket was, wouldn't it still be a terrible mistake to bring a blanket from inside the house right into the middle of a crime scene?" Scheck asked.</P>

<P>"I would prefer that it was not done," Fung said.</P>

<P>Fung also said he "questioned the judgment" of Detective Tom Lange, who asked the criminalist to bring a glove found at Simpson's home into the middle of the bloody crime scene at Bundy to be compared to a glove found near the bodies.</P>

<P>"I knew there was a danger of cross-contamination," Fung said. "I did have some concern, and I drew a line where I would not take the glove out of the bag."</P>

<P>Scheck also pressed Fung about letting criminalist Andrea Mazzola collect most of the blood evidence. "Would it be fair to call her a rookie in processing crime scenes?" he asked.</P>

<P>The prosecution objected to the use of the term rookie. Judge Ito sustained the objection. "There have been rookies of the year who have been MVPs," the judge said.</P>

<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P><B>APRIL 6</B> - The trial was thrown into turmoil as three jurors got sick, and Judge Lance Ito ordered an investigation into a dismissed juror's comments about possible juror misconduct.</P>

<P>And defense lawyer Johnnie Cochran suggested that there is a campaign to remove pro-defense jurors from the panel. He also said defense witnesses have been followed and harassed and suggested that someone is targeting jurors for misconduct allegations in order to affect the trial's outcome.</P>

<P>"We think that Big Brother is doing more than just watching us on this case," he said, during a press conference. "We are very, very concerned about what seems to be a concerted effort to go after certain jurors on this case."</P>

<P>He said the defense doesn't want a mistrial and, if it becomes necessary, he would accept a verdict from fewer than 12 jurors.</P>

<P>The defense also filed a motion accusing prosecutors of misconduct. The defense alleges that prosecutor Rockne Harmon, or someone working on his behalf, eavesdropped or intercepted privileged communications between defense attorneys and their experts. </P>

<P>"They've been followed to scientific meetings they have attended over the last few months, and there has been a history of this kind of conduct, particularly on the part of some of the members of the prosecution team," defense attorney Peter Neufeld said.</P>

<P>In response to the allegations, Los Angeles District Attorney Gil Garcetti said, "We are seeking the truth and we're doing it in an ethical, professional and honorable way."</P>

<P>The furor over the jury stemmed from statements by Jeannette Harris. She was dismissed from the panel on Wednesday because she failed to disclose on her jury questionnaire that she had an incident of domestic violence in her past. </P>

<P>In a 1988 court document involving a child custody dispute, Harris said her husband Melvin "forcibly made me have sex with him" and "pushed and shoved me." She expressed fear in the document that the abuse would get even more violent. She said Thursday that the dispute was settled and forgotten about. She is still married to Melvin Harris.</P>

<P>Harris told a television station that jurors had the chance to talk about the case with friends and relatives during unmonitored phone calls. She also claimed that jurors were discussing the case among themselves and that there was racial tension within the jury. She also accused the sheriffs' deputies of contributing to the racial split. Harris also said she was not convinced of Simpson's guilt by what the prosecution has presented so far, and predicted the case would end in a hung jury.</P>

<P>Judge Ito has repeatedly cautioned the jurors not to discuss any aspects of the case among themselves or with anyone else. He must now decided whether the jurors can still be fair and impartial. </P>

<P>Deputy John Castro of the Sheriff's Department denied the allegation that deputies were contributing to any problem.</P>

<P>In the only ruling of the day, Judge Ito decided the defense could show a videotape which purportedly shows a key piece of evidence, a leather glove, lying on a blood-stained blanket at the murder scene. The defense claims the glove was moved at the crime scene.</P>

<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P><B>APRIL 7</B> - The trial was in recess for a second day due to the illness of three jurors. The trial is scheduled to resume on Tuesday. Judge Lance Ito has other obligations on Monday.</P>

<P>Meanwhile, Judge Ito rejected a defense effort to challenge the admissibility of DNA evidence. And in another ruling, he said the defense could question the coroner in the case, Dr. Erwin Golden, about mistakes he had made in the past. But the judge ruled the defense could not question Golden about allegations that he took a gun to work, waved a gun around or threatened to kill lawyers.</P>

<H2>Week by Week in the O.J. Simpson Criminal Trial</H2>

<H3>Week 12 (April 10 - 14, 1995)</H3>

<P><B>APRIL 10</B> - Judge Lance Ito subpoenaed Jeanette Harris, the juror removed from the panel last week. Harris was ordered to appear in the judge's chambers on Wednesday afternoon.</P>

<P>The judge ordered an investigation into the jury's conduct after Harris said that jurors were discussing the case among themselves and with others during unmonitored telephone calls. She also accused sheriff's deputies of promoting racial tensions by favoring the white panelists.</P>

<P>There was no testimony in the case because the judge had other obligations.</P>

<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P><B>APRIL 11</B> - After a five-day hiatus, testimony resumed with criminalist Dennis Fung and defense attorney Barry Scheck engaging in exchanges over the handling of the crucial physical evidence.</P>

<P>At one point, Scheck accused Fung of grabbing a blood-spattered envelope found at the feet of the victims without wearing protective gloves. Scheck then showed a photograph of a bare hand holding the envelope but Fung denied that it was his hand.</P>

<P>Fung did concede however that evidence at the Bundy crime scene had been moved. He said he had learned that the envelope, which contained prescription glasses, had been moved twice, as had a bloody glove, to make way for coroner's officers to take the bodies from the scene outside Nicole Brown Simpson's townhouse. </P>

<P>Meanwhile, Simpson's attorneys asked Judge Lance Ito for a hearing to determine if prosecutors have been trying to remove jurors who may be "favorably predisposed" to returning a not guilty verdict.</P>

<P>The defense contends that prosecutors want to force a mistrial by removing enough jurors to bring the panel's number under 12. </P>

<P>By law, the prosecution can not ask for a mistrial. But the judge can declare a mistrial if the number of jurors falls below 12. </P>

<P>The prosecution denied that they were behind any efforts to remove jurors.</P>

<P>"Let me assure you of this, no one investigates any juror in this case without the express consent and direction of Judge Ito," prosecutor Chris Darden said. "The (Los Angeles County) Sheriff's Department does not take it upon itself to investigate jurors."</P>

<P>The issue of the jury arose last week after Judge Ito dismissed juror Jeanette Harris last week for failing to disclose a previous incident of domestic violence.</P>

<P>In the defense motion, Simpson's attorneys argue that if the jury panel drops below 12 and a mistrial is declared, the prosecution should be banned from retrying the case. It also states that the defense has "grave concerns" about the sheriff's deputies guarding the sequestered jury and is asking they be replaced by social workers, court civilian employees or other county workers.</P>

<P>Scheck's questioning of Fung was highlighted by the playing of the crime scene video.</P>

<P>"That's you getting the prescription envelope from (criminalist) Andrea Mazzola, grasping it in your bare hands, isn't it?" Scheck asked Fung after the video was played at various speeds both backward and forward. "No," Fung said. "I know my fingerprints are not on that envelope."</P>

<P>Scheck showed the tape again, freezing a frame that showed Mazzola, holding a letter-size object in her hand before passing it to him.</P>

<P>"There! There! How about that, Mr. Fung?" Scheck exclaimed. "Does that refresh your recollection that you took the envelope from Andrea Mazzola with your bare hand?"</P>

<P>When Scheck asked what the object could possibly be, Fung replied, "A notepad maybe? ... I'm saying it could be anything, but it's not the envelope."</P>

<P>The defense is setting the stage to challenge the DNA evidence in the case -- arguing that the DNA test results are unreliable because the evidece was collected in a sloppy manner.</P>

<P>And Fung's testimony included several admissions that support the defense's arguments.</P>

<P>He testified that he didn't tell his superiors when he found new blood stains inside Simpson's Ford Bronco six weeks after the initial search and investigation of the vehicle. Fung, however, said he collected only a "representative sample" of the blood smears, and that was why there was still blood on the console six weeks later.</P>

<P>Fung also said there was no blood found on the carpeting in Simpson's bedroom where investigators found a pair of blood-stained socks. And, he conceded that he was wrong to testified that that the collection of evidence didn't begin until after personnel from the coroner's office left the crime scene.</P>

<P>Scheck also used television news videotape of police at the crime scene to try and show the possible contamination of the bloody glove found near Ronald Goldman's body.</P>

<P>But Fung dismissed Scheck's contention that the glove was tossed onto a blanket from Nicole Simpson's condominium that was used to cover her body. </P>

<P>"You know it's the glove, don't you?" Scheck asked.</P>

<P>"I don't know that," Fung replied.</P>

<P>"You know it's the glove, and you just got caught by the videotape," Scheck insisted.</P>

<P>Prosecutors tried to prevent the jury from seeing the video. They said that camera angles and lighting were distorting the picture, and the glove was not really sitting on the blanket. The judge ruled last week that that was for the jury to decide.</P>

<P>Scheck also questioned Fung's training in the collection of evidence for DNA testing. Prosecutor Hank Goldberg repeatedly objected, saying DNA was not part of Fung's expertise, but Judge Ito permitted the questions. Scheck confronted Fung with textbooks on evidence collection which stated that wet stains, such as blood, should never be packed in plastic. Such packaging can foster the growth of bacteria, which can eat away at the DNA and distort test results.</P>

<P>Fung said he knew that but placed samples in plastic nevertheless. He said the plastic bagging was a temporary container for blood samples and other evidence.</P>

<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P><B>APRIL 12</B> - Defense attorney Barry Scheck continued to question aggressively criminalist Dennis Fung about the collection of blood samples from the crime scene and from O.J. Simpson's estate.</P>

<P>But instead of merely insinuating that Fung made mistakes in the handling of the evidence, Scheck's questioning suggested that Fung was lying about blood allegedly found on the sill of Simpson's Ford Bronco. The defense also used apparent inconsistencies in Fung's testimony to suggest that he was involved in an effort to frame Simpson for the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman.</P>

<P>Meanwhile, the investigation continued into a dismissed panelist's claims of jury problems. Judge Lance Ito met for 35 to 40 minutes with the ousted juror, Jeanette Harris. Harris reiterated all of her previous allegations including claims that sheriffs' deputies were fostering racial tensions among the jurors, her attorney said after the hearing.</P>

<P>At the end of the day, Scheck produced two new videotapes showing Fung leaving Simpson's home on June 13. The defense claims the videos cast doubt on Fung's account of how he carried Simpson's blood from the scene. The prosecution asked for time to review the tapes, and testimony was halted for the day.</P>

<P>Fung testified that Detective Philip Vannatter gave him a blood sample taken from Simpson at police headquarters earlier on June 13. Fung said he received the blood from Vannatter in the foyer of Simpson's home. The vial was in a grey envelope, and he opened it in the foyer to examine it. </P>

<P>When Scheck asked whether this was normal procedure for booking evidence, Fung said, "I can't remember one instance where that [evidence was transported to him instead of being booked at the Evidence Control Unit] happened."</P>

<P>The defense believes the videotapes will disprove Fung's version of events. One video shows Fung and criminalist Andrea Mazzola leaving Rockingham. Fung is seen holding some brown bags and his black catalogue case. At the end ofthe tape, Fung can be heard telling Mazzola that they should go back into the house for one more look. </P>

<P>The second video shows Fung and Mazzola again leaving Rockingham after they had their one last look. This time, Fung does not have anything in his hands.</P>

<P>The defense appears to be trying to show that Fung didn't get the blood vial from Vannatter on June 13 because he is not seen holding the grey envelope in either of the videos. The defense has suggested that taking a vial of Simpson's blood to his home gave police the opportunity to frame him for murder.</P>

<P>Scheck also questioned Fung about blood samples taken from Simpson's Ford Bronco. He wanted to know why samples taken from the Bronco on July 6 were not visible to Fung when investigators searched the vehicle on June 14.</P>

<P>The defense is trying to show that Fung never saw the stains on June 14 or July 6, and that the criminalist is trying to protect Detective Mark Fuhrman. Fuhrman previously testified that he saw the four stains - and that is why detectives decided to scale the fence onto Simpson's property in the early morning hours of June 13.</P>

<P>Scheck also confronted Fung with a textbook on evidence collection that recommended never placing blood-soaked items in plastic because it could foster bacterial growth and distort test results.</P>

<P>Fung testified that blood samples collected from the murder scene were stored for several hours in a hot police van and could have deteriorated, adding that a refrigerator in the van where the samples should have been stored was not working. He said the plastic was a temporary holder until the evidence could be taken to the crime lab.</P>

<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P><B>APRIL 13</B> - Defense attorney Barry Scheck concluded his cross-examination of criminalist Dennis Fung by accusing Fung of destroying evidence in an effort to cover up the fact that he lied about when he received a vial of O.J. Simpson's blood. </P>

<P>Fung had testified that Detective Philip Vannatter gave him a vial of Simpson's blood on June 13, 1994. But Scheck played a news videotape showing Fung and his assistant putting evidence in their crime scene truck at Simpson's estate and locking the truck before Vannatter arrived. </P>

<P>"And when you saw these series of tapes, Mr. Fung, you realized you had been caught in a lie, didn't you?" Scheck asked. </P>

<P>"No," Fung said. He explained that he now remembered that his assistant, Andrea Mazzola, had carried the vial to the truck in a black plastic bag. </P>

<P>The defense claims Fung did not receive Simpson's blood until June 14, giving police time to smear part of the sample on other evidence, including socks and Simpson's white Ford Bronco. </P>

<P>Scheck then accused Fung of destroying a page of his original crime scene report, and substituting it with another page, to cover up the fact that he had written that he received the blood sample from Vannatter at 5:20 p.m. on June 13, when by that time Fung had already left Simpson's estate. Fung denied the allegation. </P>

<P>After Scheck finished his cross-examination, prosecutor Hank Goldberg, started his re-direct examination of Fung by asking whether the criminalist participated in a conspiracy to frame Simpson. Fung said he did not.</P>

<P>Meanwhile, dismissed juror Jeanette Harris told Judge Lance Ito of physical fights and racial conflict among jurors including incidents of hitting and kicking, according to a partial transcript of Wednesday's hearing. She also detailed claims that sheriffs' deputies were fostering racial tensions. She told the judge that jurors watched movies in segregated rooms and that black jurors could not see the movies until after the white jurors had seen it. </P>

<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P><B>APRIL 14</B> - Judge Lance Ito ruled that prosecutors violated a court order by failing to disclose to the defense a page of criminalist Dennis Fung's notes.</P>

<P>In cross-examining police criminalist Dennis Fung Thursday, defense attorney Barry Scheck suggested that Fung replaced an original page from his crime scene checklist with an altered photocopy to further what the defense alleges was a police conspiracy to frame O.J. Simpson. Scheck noted the page did not have staple marks found on other pages .</P>

<P>But during a break in Fung's testimony after Scheck had concluded his cross-examination, prosecutors said they conducted a search and found the original document in a crime laboratory notebook. Prosecutor Hank Goldberg then tried to deflate the defense's conspiracy theory with the surprise introduction of the document, which Fung identified as the missing page. </P>

<P>Scheck accused the prosecution Friday of "intentional misconduct" for failing to share their discovery with the defense. Goldberg argued that the prosecution did not have an obligation to do so.</P>

<P>Judge Ito ruled that the misplacing of the original page was inadvertent. However, the material should have been turned over because there is a standing court order to provide original documents to the defense. He said he would instruct the jury that the prosecution violated the court order but rejected a defense request to throw out the testimony.</P>

<H2>Week by Week in the O.J. Simpson Criminal Trial</H2>

<H3>Week 13 (April 17 - 21, 1995)</H3>

<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P><B>APRIL 17</B> - Judge Lance Ito said he would speak individually with each of the 12 jurors and six alternates about allegations of racial tension among them.</P>

<P>The allegations came from Jeanette Harris, a black juror who was dismissed April 5 because she failed to report a past experience with domestic violence. In a television interview, Harris said that sheriff's deputies favored whites and that she was kicked by a white female juror. She gave several other examples of black jurors suffering verbal and physical abuse.</P>

<P>Robert Shapiro began the day with an apology in open court to criminalist Dennis Fung, a prosecution witness, and any other minority who was offended last Thursday when he handed out fortune cookies from the "Hang Fung Restaurant" to court observers.</P>

<P>Shapiro said the cookies were at the counsel tables when he arrived. He offered some to two members of the press and "made a remark which was meant to be facetious and was taken by those who received it as being facetious."</P>

<P>Shapiro said he regretted that those remarks could have been misconstrued and told Judge Ito that he personally apologized to Fung outside the court.</P>

<P>Fung returned to the witness stand for the eight day to explain how he collected evidence at Simpson's home and the crime scene. Prosecutor Hank Goldberg spent most of the day trying to debunk the defense theory that Fung lied when he received a vial of Simpson's blood as part of a police cover-up.</P>

<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P><B>APRIL 18</B> - After nine grueling days of testimony, Dennis Fung, an LAPD criminalist testifying for the prosecution, surprised the court by shaking hands with O.J. Simpson and his lawyers.</P>

<P>This unusual move, coming after several days of blistering cross-examination from defense lawyer Barry Scheck, occurred as jurors were preparing to leave the courtroom and it is unclear how many of them saw it happen.</P>

<P>It is also unclear whether Fung did this as a way of accepting defense lawyer Robert Shapiro's apology for his fortune cookie joke last week. Fung also shook hands with lawyers for the prosecution.</P>

<P>In testimony, Fung again denied covering up mistakes made by police at the crime scene. Under a barrage of questioning by defense attorney Barry Scheck, Fung denied that he was saying what the prosecution told him to say, rather than the truth. He also denied using a selective memory.</P>

<P>Judge Lance Ito told lawyers on both sides that he would recess court until Thursday and speak individually with each juror over statements by Jeanette Harris, who was bounced off the panel. Harris said that the jury was wracked by racial strife.</P>

<P>Lawyers will attend the interviews, but Simpson will not, Judge Ito ruled.</P>

<P>The possibility was raised that Kato Kaelin, Simpson's houseguest, will be called back to testify after author Michael Elliot said in a television interview that he interviewed Kaelin with the intention of collaborating on a book.</P>

<P>Elliot said Kaelin told a completely different story than the one he told in court. Prosecutor Christopher Darden handed copies of Elliot's taped interview to the defense Monday.</P>

<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P><B>APRIL 19</B> - With court in recess, Judge Lance Ito spent the day interviewing jurors over allegations made by former juror Jeanette Harris.</P>

<P>Lawyers from both sides were present. The trial is set to resume Thursday.</P>

<P>"I believe we'll be able to finish this case," said defense lawyer Johnnie Cochran. "Some of the things [the jurors said] concerned me, but they're not irreconcilable."</P>

<P>Harris, who was bounced from the jury April 5 because she failed to report a past experience of domestic violence, said in a television interview that sheriff's deputies favored white jurors and that the jury was divided by racial animosity.</P>

<P>She also said jurors were discussing the case with one another and that phone calls and family visits were not properly supervised.</P>

<P>Judge Ito's investigation is expected to continue with the questioning of sheriff's deputies.</P>

<P>Following the disclosure of taped interviews of Simpson houseguest Kato Kaelin, District Attorney Gil Garcetti said he was considering recalling Kaelin to the witness stand.</P>

<P>In the interviews, conducted by author Mark Elliot, Kaelin described Simpson's relationship with Nicole Simpson Brown far differently than he did in his testimony, the author said.</P>

<P>"If you listen to the tapes and you listen to his testimony, you will hear two completely different versions of events," Elliot said.</P>

<P>Elliot said that he was writing a book in cooperation with Kaelin based on 17 hours of interviews conducted between December and February. Kaelin said under testimony that he had no plans to write a book.</P>

<P>Michael Plotkin, Kaelin's agent and lawyer, said Kaelin never signed a book contract and that his client's testimony was truthful.</P>

<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P><B>APRIL 20</B> - Judge Lance Ito replaced three deputies following accusations from a former juror that some deputies were fomenting racial discord among the panel.</P>

<P>Judge Ito made no statement, but this action came a day after he recessed court to investigate the charges by Jeanette Harris, who was dismissed from the jury April 5 because she failed to report a past experience of domestic violence.</P>

<P>On Tuesday afternoon and Wednesday, all twelve jurors and six alternates met individually with the judge.</P>

<P>The deputies looked extremely agitated Thursday as they were seen escorted from court, said Dan Abrams, a Court TV reporter.</P>

<P>Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block denounced Judge Ito's decision, complaining that the judge released the deputies without interviewing them.</P>

<P>"I understand the judge is trying to retain the jury numbers he now has," Block said Thursday at a press conference. "I am offended because that effort is being made on the backs of my deputies."</P>

<P>In court, LAPD criminalist Andrea Mazzola, 34, took the stand and described her role collecting evidence at the Rockingham crime scene and at O.J. Simpson's house. Prosecutor Hank Goldberg asked about her credentials in response to attacks from defense lawyers that she lacked the experience to collect sensitive DNA evidence.</P>

<P>Though Mazzola is referred to as a trainee, she worked for 18 months at the Kern County District Attorney's office as a criminalist in toxicology. She has additional experience working at a private lab and studied criminology in college, according to her testimony.</P>

<P>Goldberg attempted to prove that Dennis Fung, Mazzola's supervisor, received a vial of Simpson's blood on June 13 at Simpson's house. During cross-examination of Fung, defense lawyer Barry Scheck had shown a videotape in which Fung's hands were empty as he was leaving the house that day. Fung then said the blood was in a garbage bag that Mazzola was carrying.</P>

<P>To rehabilitate Fung's testimony, Goldberg showed Mazzola the videotape of her walking with Fung and carrying a trash bag. Although she could not definitively say she remembered carrying the blood vial in the bag, she ruled out any other explanation.</P>

<P>In cross-examination, defense lawyer Peter Neufeld accused Mazzola of altering crime scene reports to make it look as though Fung had collected key evidence. Neufeld attempted to belittle Mazzola's education and experience. He pointed out that she was still on employment probation June 13, when she reported to the crime scene.</P>

<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P><B>APRIL 21</B> - A jury protest over the dismissal of three deputies caused Judge Lance Ito to recess the court Friday and Monday.</P>

<P>Thirteen of the 12 jurors and six alternates refused to board the bus to take them to court Friday morning. In a note to Judge Ito, they requested he come speak with them at the hotel where they are sequestered.</P>

<P>The jury later agreed to be taken to the courthouse but refused to enter the jury box without speaking with the judge. The 13 jurors were dressed in dark clothing -- some all in black -- in apparent protest.</P>

<P>Judge Ito met Friday with seven jurors and will resume interviews Monday. Afterwards, he is scheduled to meet with the three dismissed deputies. The trial is scheduled to resume Tuesday.</P>

<P>Judge Ito will speak with jurors in his chambers. Lawyers from both sides will be present and may suggest questions for the judge to ask. The sessions are on the record.</P>

<P>Coming nearly three months after opening statements, the protest raises concern of a mistrial. The recess interrupted the testimony of criminalist Andrea Mazzola, the 41st witness in the case.</P>

<H2>Week by Week in the O.J. Simpson Criminal Trial</H2>

<H3>Week 14 (April 24 - 28, 1995)</H3>

<P><B>APRIL 24</B> - After many jurors refused to go to court Friday, Judge Lance Ito met with them one at a time Monday in the hopes of avoiding a mistrial.</P>

<P>Thirteen of the 12 jurors and six alternates refused to board the bus to come to court in the morning, following the dismissal a day earlier of three sheriff's deputies who were guarding them.</P>

<P>The jurors later agreed to go to court, but only if they could speak with the judge. Many of them wore black, apparently in protest of the dismissals.</P>

<P>The deputies were removed in wake of charges made by former juror Jeanette Harris, who said in a television interview that some deputies were promoting racial tension on the jury by favoring white members over blacks. She also said that family visits and telephone calls were poorly monitored.</P>

<P>Judge Ito suspended testimony after the jurors began their protest. The trial is scheduled to resume Tuesday.</P>

<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P><B>APRIL 25</B> - After a four-day hiatus because of jury problems, testimony resumed with Judge Lance Ito appearing more determined to speed the trial along.</P>

<P>The judge, who has been widely criticized for allowing the trial to proceed at a snail's pace, repeatedly urged defense attorney Peter Neufeld to "move along" with his questioning of criminalist Andrea Mazzola, and interrupted the lawyer when he felt his questions were becoming repetitive. He even ordered two spectators removed from the courtroom because they were talking, and issued an order shortening the lunch recess from 90 minutes to one hour, effective Monday.</P>

<P>Mazzola spent the day under cross-examination, testifying about her role in the collection of blood samples from the Bundy and Rockingham crime scenes. Neufeld also questioned her about Dennis Fung's role in collecting the crucial physical evidence.</P>

<P>Mazzola said she collected most of the blood from both crime scenes, some of the time without Fung supervising her -- a much different story than the one Fung told the grand jury in July. At the time, he said that he collected most of the blood stains. Mazzola supported Fung's testimony that the two worked as a team.</P>

<P>Neufeld tried to portray Mazzola as incompetent, using a videotape produced by prosecutors. The tape showed that while demonstrating the collection of evidence, Mazzola rested her hand on dirty pavement; wiped a tweezers with the dirty hand; rested her knees on the dirty pavement; brushed her gloved hand on the dirty knee; and dropped several swabs.</P>

<P>In another effort to portray her as inept, Neufeld quesioned Mazzola on several points including her use of one cotton swab to test for blood on three different areas of Simpson's Ford Bronco. Mazzola admitted she had been trained to use separate swabs for different areas but that Fung told her to use one swab on all three areas.</P>

<P>Mazzola conceded that mistakes could happen when collecting vital evidence from the scene of a crime. She also admitted that inadvertent mistakes could be made by crime investigators at the scene which might not be noticed at the time they were made.</P>

<P>"So you really can't say ... that you have never made any mistake at the few crime scenes that you have participated in, can you?" Neufeld asked.</P>

<P>"That's true," Mazzola replied.</P>

<P>The defense is trying to show that vital blood evidence could have been contaminated by the collection procedures employed by Mazzola and Fung.</P>

<P>But Mazzola denied that anyone in the police crime lab would alter evidence. The defense has suggested that police tried to frame Simpson in the murders of his former wife and Ronald Goldman.</P>

<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P><B>APRIL 26</B> - Judge Lance Ito continued his efforts to move the trial along by warning lawyers that he was getting fed up with their courtroom behavior.</P>

<P>He told the lawyers that he would admonish them in front of the jury if they continued to ask improper questions. The judge said he had "probably sustained 1,000 objections" for argumentative questions alone.</P>

<P>Meanwhile, criminalist Andrea Mazzola returned to the witness stand for a third day of cross-examination by defense attorney Peter Neufeld.</P>

<P>The defense continued to try and portray Mazzola as an inexperienced and incompetent investigator and focused on the vial of blood taken from Simpson on the day after the murders.</P>

<P>Mazzola acknowledged she never saw the vial of blood at Simpson's home. Nor, she said, did she even know that she was carrying it out of Simpson's house in a plastic bag, as criminalist Dennis Fung previously testified she had done.</P>

<P>Neufeld implied it was too convenient for Mazzola to claim she rested her eyes about the time a detective supposedly handed the vial of blood to Fung.</P>

<P>"Miss Mazzola," Neufeld asked, "did you invent this notion that your eyes were closed so that Mr. Fung could testify that he received the vial without you seeing it?"</P>

<P>Ito sustained an objection and Mazzola didn't have to answer.</P>

<P>Neufeld also elicited testimony from Mazzola that she didn't have an "independent recollection" of picking up a glove and ski cap at the murder scene, actions that were captured on videotape and played in court.</P>

<P>"Yet, you have an independent recollection that while you were sitting on a couch you closed your eyes? You had that recollection ten months later?" Neufeld asked.</P>

<P>"Yes," Mazzola replied.</P>

<P>Fung and Detective Philip Vannatter have testified that Vannatter delivered the vial to Fung on June 13. Simpson willingly provided a sample of his blood at police headquarters, and Vannatter said he drove it across town to Simpson's estate, where Fung and Mazzola were collecting evidence.</P>

<P>The defense contends the blood wasn't handed over to Fung that day and the delay gave police an opportunity to plant it.</P>

<P>Prosecutor Hank Goldberg then began his re-direct by directing asking Mazzola whether she was involved in a conspiracy to frame Simpson for murder.</P>

<P>Not only was she not part of a police conspiracy, Mazzola testified, she didn't even know who Simpson was when she and Fung arrived at his home to start collecting evidence.</P>

<P>"Mr. Fung kept saying, 'O.J.'s house' ... and I said, 'O.J. who?' " Mazzola said. "He said, 'movies, sports ... ' It just did not ring a bell."</P>

<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P><B>APRIL 27</B> - Criminalist Andrea Mazzola completed her testimony after undergoing a cross-examination nearly as tough as the one on her supervisor, Dennis Fung.</P>

<P>Most of the day consisted of laborious testimony with Deputy District Attorney Hank Goldberg trying to rehabilitate Mazzola during redirect examination as a competent criminalist who did not participate in any scheme to frame O.J. Simpson.</P>

<P>Some of the most interesting testimony came when defense attorney Peter Neufeld tried to show that Mazzola could have been involved in a cover-up for Fung.</P>

<P>Neufeld began the line of questioning by reminding Mazzola that she testified during a pretrial hearing on August 23, 1994 that she had initialed all the coin envelopes and bindles used to preserve blood samples taken from the crime scenes. Neufeld then asked Mazzola to sift through all the bindles and envelopes takes from Simpson's Rockingham estate. He asked her to indicate which ones had her initials. She had to admit that none of them did.</P>

<P>Neufeld then asked when Mazzola found out that her initials were not on the envelopes and bindles. She responded that she noticed it when she just happened to walk past the serology lab and saw the evidence lying on a table. Neufeld questioned whether this was possible since the serology room is quite large, with a long table and criminalists working on several cases at a time. Besides, he pointed out, how could Mazzola just happen to see the envelope and bindles with particular writing on them. And he suggested that Mazzola found out some other way, adding that Mazzola had told the truth at the August pretrial hearing but that Fung - as part of the conspiracy - could have changed the originals and that the envelopes and bindles unsealed in court were not the originals.</P>

<P>"Did you realize that if the prosecutors could not produce the orignal bindles, that that would be devastating," Neufeld asked. But Mazzola did not have to answer the question because Judge Lance Ito sustained a prosecution objection that the question was improper.</P>

<P>During redirect examination, Goldberg asked whether she was involved in an elaborate conspiracy with the police agasinst Simpson. Mazzola said she was not.</P>

<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P><B>APRIL 28</B> - There was no testimony. Judge Lance Ito scheduled a short hearing to determine whether sketches of jurors violate the rule which prohibits identifying jurors in the media.</P>

<H2>Week by Week in the O.J. Simpson Criminal Trial</H2>

<H3>Week 15 (May 1 - 5, 1995)</H3>

<P><B>MAY 1</B> - A black female flight attendant, who recently said she could not take the trial any more, was removed from the jury and replaced by a Hispanic real estate appraiser.</P>

<P>Judge Lance Ito announced the latest change to the jury before chief forensic chemist Gregory Matheson took the witness stand. </P>

<P>The judge said he had found "good cause" to excuse the juror. On April 20, the juror had asked Judge Ito to excuse her because she "couldn't take it anymore."</P>

<P>The move reduces the remaining alternates to five with several months to go in the trial.</P>

<P>The newest juror is a 28-year-old woman who works for the Los Angeles County assessor's office. In her jury questionnaire, the woman said she had formed no opinions about Simpson's guilt or innocence, but she wrote: "He's the only person who had a visible motive. It was his ex-wife and she was with another man. It's something most people would have a problem with."</P>

<P>The jury now has seven blacks, three whites and two Hispanics. There are nine women and three men.</P>

<P>The first part of Matheson's testimony was spent defending the work of criminalists Dennis Fung and Andrea Mazzola. Prosecutor Hank Goldberg asked him questions to debunk, if not belittle, many of the defense theories surrounding the work of the criminalists. For example, Matheson testified that which criminalist at a crime scene collects evidence is not an important issue. The defense tried to show that Fung and Mazzola lied about who collected the evidence in order to hide the fact that the less experienced Mazzola did much of the work. </P>

<P>Matheson also testified about the video played last week in which Mazzola showed how evidence should be collected. The defense used the video to try and discredit Mazzola because she was seen doing a few things that could be interpreted as sloppy. Matheson said Mazzola did not do anything on the video that would necessarily result in the contamination of evidence.</P>

<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P><B>MAY 2</B> - The jury heard the most damaging evidence so far against O.J. Simpson as a forensic chemist testified that a sample from a bloody trail near the spot where Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman were killed was found to be consistent with Simpson's blood type.</P>

<P>Gregory Matheson, chief forensic chemist at the Los Angeles Police Crime Lab, testified that blood and enzyme tests revealed that blood found alongside a trail of bloody shoeprints leading from the murder scene was the same type as Simpson's blood. Only 0.5 percent of the population, or one person in 200 have that blood type.</P>

<P>Tests on a bloody glove found at the scene showed the blood was consistent with that of Goldman, a blood type found in about 20 percent of the population, Matheson said. The same was true of blood on the fence near where his body lay. Nicole Simpson's blood, which is the same type as 40 percent of the population, was found on the front gate to her home.</P>

<P>Matheson showed jury members a chart of serology test results and explained how tests had been carried out on various items found at the crime scene. The results were compared to blood taken from Simpson by police the day after the June 12, 1994 murders and to blood samples taken from the bodies of the victims. </P>

<P>Matheson said the crime lab examination consisted of conventional tests and not the comparatively new DNA tests, the results of which are expected to be introduced later in the trial. Matheson explained that conventional blood testing is used to exclude -- not include -- individuals as the source of the blood. By examining enzyme characteristics (also known as genetic markers) of blood samples, Matheson said police can calculate what percentage of the population has those traits. The more traits examined, he said, the narrower the search becomes as more and more people are excluded as the possible source of the blood.</P>

<P>Matheson also testified about the blood found under Nicole Simpson's fingernails at the crime scene. The defense contends the blood does not match either of the victims or Simpson, but a fourth person who is the real killer. But the prosecution argues, and Matheson testified, that the blood under the nails does not match Nicole Simpson's blood type because the blood already had started to degrade by the time it was tested. Degraded blood can give a false or misleading test result. Matheson said that because Nicole Simpson's hand was found resting in the blood and because damp blood degrades quickly, there's a "very high likelihood" that the blood under her fingernails was hers.</P>

<P>This part of the testimony included graphic photographs of Nicole Simpson's body. This was the first time in several months that the jury had seen photos of the victims, and courtroom spectators said Simpson brushed away tears when the gruesome photos were displayed.</P>

<P>During his testimony, Matheson conceded that minor mistakes were made in the investigation. The admission came one day after he defended the work of criminalists Dennis Fung and Andrea Mazzola.</P>

<P>The chief forensic chemist told the jury that criminalists should have collected more blood from Simpson's Ford Bronco. </P>

<P>"Probably, the best thing to have done was to remove more of the sample originally, on the first search," Matheson said. He said there was blood on the Bronco's console, a hard yet porous surface that would have been easy to remove initially. Investigators collected additional samples during subsequent searches of the vehicle.</P>

<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P><B>MAY 3</B> - O.J. Simpson's lawyers were able to get a key prosecution witness to acknowledge the possibility that evidence was mishandled.</P>

<P>Under cross-examination by defense lawyer Robert Blaiser, Gregory Matheson, chief forensic chemist and assistant director of the Los Angeles Police Department crime lab, agreed that crime scene investigators made some mistakes and failed to follow guidelines.</P>

<P>Matheson said that it was wrong for criminalist Andrea Mazzola to use the same swatch on several blood samples in Simpson's Bronco and that it would have been better if she collected more evidence. He also said she made a mistake when she rolled up a section of the car's carpet because blood from one area could have been spread to another area.</P>

<P>But Matheson said the mistakes were merely technicalities and did not effect the integrity of the evidence. Earlier in the week, he testified on direct examination that blood taken from the crime scene was consistent with Simpson's.</P>

<P>Blaiser spent most of the day trying to advance the defense's theory that shoddy police work in collecting blood and DNA samples tainted the evidence and allowed for a conspiracy to frame Simpson.</P>

<P>This was Matheson's third day on the witness stand. Cross-examination is set to continue Thursday.</P>

<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P><B>MAY 4</B> - Blood taken from beneath Nicole Brown Simpson's fingertips could have come from someone other than her accused killer, O.J. Simpson, a prosecution witness said Thursday under cross-examination.</P>

<P>Greg Matheson, chief forensic scientist at the Los Angeles Police crime lab, conceded that according to scientific literature offered by the defense, the blood was inconsistent with a genetic marker in the blood of either O.J. Simpson or his slain ex-wife.</P>

<P>Defense attorney Robert Blaiser produced several science articles detailing the degrading pattern of type BA blood into type B. He got Matheson to agree that the degradation route discussed in the articles would not allow for the type of degradation prosecutors claim occurred.</P>

<P>Trying to advance the defense's theory that Simpson was framed in a police conspiracy, Blaiser argued that a significant amount of a blood sample taken from Simpson could not be accounted for, suggesting that 1.5 milliliters of the sample was used to plant evidence.</P>

<P>Matheson maintained that the sample was used for testing and that he and other members of the crime lab didn't keep a strict account of how much was used or discarded.</P>

<P>Prosecutor Hank Goldberg pointed out, through questioning Matheson, that there are several ways for type BA blood to degrade into type B. Goldberg established that different scientific literature allows for the degradation route that prosecutors say occurred.</P>

<P>In a ruling later in the day, Judge Lance Ito barred defense lawyers from introducing into evidence a blood-stained knife found outside Simpson's home July 2. Prosecutors successfully argued that the knife was found nearly three weeks after the double murder and that the blood on it does not match either victim.</P>

<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P><B>MAY 5</B> - The prosecution sought to account for a missing portion of O.J. Simpson's blood sample to debunk the defense theory that Los Angeles police framed the former football star.</P>

<P>Greg Matheson, the chief forensic chemist at the Los Angeles Police crime lab, said that after testifying in court Thursday he replicated the procedures his department uses. He said the tests, conducted at home, suggest that some of the missing blood may have stuck to pipettes, gloves, and other lab instruments.</P>

<P>The defense claims that 1.5 milliliters of blood from the 6.5 milliliter sample drawn from Simpson shortly after the double murder June 12 last year was stolen and sprinkled over evidence at the murder scene, Simpson's home and car.</P>

<P>Matheson said he found that .5 milliliters of blood adhered to the pipettes -- a tube-like instrument used to withdraw blood from a vial -- when he conducted a standard procedure. Repeated tests may have accounted for more of the blood, he said.</P>

<P>Defense lawyer Robert Blasier used a chart Thursday to show that 1.5 milliliters of the blood sample was missing.</P>

<P>On Friday, Prosecutor Hank Goldberg said the defense's figures are inaccurate because they are purported to be exact when they are merely estimations.</P>

<P>Blasier and Matheson also battled over whether FBI tests showed the presence of EDTA, a chemical preservative, in blood found on the rear gate at Simpson's home. The presence of EDTA would support the theory that detectives stole Simpson's blood from the lab.</P>

<P>On Thursday, the family of Ronald Goldman filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Simpson, accusing him of "outrageous savagery." The suit, which became known Friday, seeks unspecified monetary damages.</P>

<P>Because Friday was a half-day in court, dress was casual, as it has been on Fridays throughout the trial. Fourteen jurors and alternates wore T-shirts from California Pizza Kitchen, a local pizzeria, with the inscription, "Fourteen ethnically diverse cultures co-existing on one thin delicious crust."</P>

<P>The jurors have eaten at the restaurant over the past three months that they've been sequestered. The court recently began investigating charges from a former juror that the panel was wracked with racial animosity toward each other.</P>

<H2>Week by Week in the O.J. Simpson Criminal Trial</H2>

<H3>Week 16 (May 8 - 12, 1995)</H3>

<P><B>MAY 8</B> - Court became biology class Monday as the prosecution's first DNA expert lectured to the jury on her specialty.</P>

<P>Dr. Robin Cotton, laboratory director of Cellmark Diagnostics Inc. in Germantown, Maryland, described DNA as a genetic blueprint. The DNA in each person is different, with the exception of identical twins, she said.</P>

<P>The testimony is a prelude to DNA evidence that prosecutors will use to try to tie O.J. Simpson to the June 12 murders of his ex-wife and her friend Ronald Goldman.</P>

<P>Cotton, a molecular biologist and the 44th witness in the trial, explained the process known as RFLP, or Restriction Fragment Link Polymorphism, which she said is the most accurate method to test DNA. Cellmark is the largest independent DNA testing laboratory in the United States.</P>

<P>To undermine the defense claim that sloppy police work ruined the integrity of key evidence, Prosecutor Woody Clark asked if the degradation of a blood sample can make the DNA look like that of another person. Cotton said no.</P>

<P>Cotton has testified in about 90 cases in more than 20 states. She used colorful charts to illustrate her points.</P>

<P>Court recessed at 1 p.m. because Judge Lance Ito planned to attend the funeral of a police detective who died last week. The direct examination of Cotton will continue Tuesday.</P>

<P>Prosecutor Clark was making his first appearance in the trial. He is a DNA legal expert on loan to the Los Angeles District Attorney's Office from the San Diego District Attorney's Office.</P>

<P>Earlier in the day, tow truck driver Bernie Douroux testified that he towed Simpson's Bronco from Simpson's home to the LAPD garage. Prosecutors wanted to show he found the car locked to discredit the defense claim that evidence was planted in the vehicle.</P>

<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P><B>MAY 9</B> - In the final minutes of testimony Tuesday, jurors saw DNA samples of O.J. Simpson and the two murder victims for the first time.</P>

<P>With no eyewitness testimony, the prosecution case largely rests on the strength of DNA evidence placing Simpson at the murder scene, which will be shown to the jury in the coming days.</P>

<P>Jurors saw copies of x-ray pictures of DNA fragments, known as autorads, from Simpson, Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman. The autorads were made from blood samples taken after the June 12 double murder.</P>

<P>In upcoming court sessions, these autorads will be compared with those from blood collected at the murder scene, Simpson's home and his car. </P>

<P>Lawyers spent much of the day battling over how evidence that contains more than one person's blood, known as mixed-blood evidence, should be presented to the jury. </P>

<P>Outside the presence of the jury, the defense argued that the prosecution should have to prove the accuracy of mixed-blood tests. The prosecution wants to present test results and let the jury decide on the credibility of the tests.</P>

<P>Speaking to reporters outside the courtroom, Prosecutor Rockne Harmon said some of the blood left on the glove found in the back yard at Simpson's estate matched that of Goldman and the football star's ex-wife. </P>

<P>Prosecutors also said a stain found on the steering wheel of Simpson's white Ford Bronco contains a mixture of DNA from Simpson and someone who may not be connected to the case. The mixture is inconsistent with the DNA of the two murder victims. It could have come from anyone who drove Simpson's car, they said.</P>

<P>Testimony on DNA tests performed on blood samples taken at the crime scene is expected to come from Dr. Robin Cotton, laboratory director at Cellmark Diagnostics Inc., which performed most of the DNA tests on blood found in the investigation.</P>

<P>Cotton described for the court the difference between the two primary genetic fingerprint tests in testimony Tuesday. She said the so-called RFLP test was more reliable than the other DNA test, known as PCR.</P>

<P>The advantages of PCR tests are that they take less time to perform and require a smaller blood sample, she said. PCR testing was required for much of the evidence in this case because samples were too small to conduct the other test.</P>

<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P><B>MAY 10</B> - In the first testimony that directly linked O.J. Simpson to the murder scene, a forensic scientist testified that DNA tests showed a genetic match between Simpson's blood and stains found near the bodies of his former wife and her friend.</P>

<P>Dr. Robin Cotton, the laboratory director of Cellmark Diagnostics in Germantown, Md., also said the tests showed that small blood stains on a sock in Simpson's bedroom had the same genetic blueprints as Nicole Brown Simpson.</P>

<P>The defense is expected to argue that the incriminating evidence against Simpson was tampered with by police before it was sent to the scientists for testing. </P>

<P>The prosecution has argued that Simpson cut his hand while slashing the victims, leaving blood drops at the crime scene and his home. Since there are no eyewitnesses and police never found a murder weapon, the heart of the state's case rests with the DNA tests of the blood evidence.</P>

<P>Testifying in a soft-spoken, calm manner, Cotton focused on three pieces of evidence: a blood drop from the foyer of Simpson's Rockingham home; a blood drop from the Bundy crime scene and a blood drop found on Ronald Goldman's shoe.</P>

<P>She said the blood drop lifted from Simpson's foyer contained DNA with the same distinctive series of genetic markers as Simpson's blood.</P>

<P>A sock found at the foot of Simpson's bed tested positive for blood, and Cellmark's analysis of DNA extracted from the sock showed that the blood could have come from Nicole Simpson. O.J. Simpson and Goldman were excluded as possible DNA "donors."</P>

<P>Though blood on the bottom of Goldman's shoe was difficult to analyze, Cotton testified that several genetic markers were consistent with Nicole Simpson's blood. </P>

<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P><B>MAY 11</B> - The prosecution introduced DNA test results to show that it was virtually impossible for anyone other than O.J. Simpson to have left a bloody trail at the murder scene and at Simpson's home.</P>

<P>Robin Cotton, laboratory director of Cellmark Diagnostics in Germantown, Md., testified that the deoxyribonucleic acid (or DNA) banding pattern found in a sample of Simpson's blood, in a blood spot on the Bundy Drive crime scene walkway and in blood from the foyer of Simpson's Rockingham home was extremely rare.</P>

<P>In the most powerful evidence yet presented against Simpson, Cotton testified the odds that blood found at the scene of his wife's murder could have come from anyone but Simpson were about one in 170 million.</P>

<P>Cotton said that blood found on one of Simpson's socks and identified as Nicole Brown Simpson's blood, had DNA characteristics matched by approximately only one in 9.7 billion Caucasians, meaning she was the only person in the world with that match. </P>

<P>The numbers, Cotton testified, were based on statistics extrapolated from a database of various DNA types kept at the Cellmark lab. They indicate the chances that someone would randomly match a certain DNA profile, Cotton said.</P>

<P>Defense attorney Peter Neufeld started his cross-examination of Cotton by suggesting that some blood from Simpson's home may in fact be Simpson's, while blood at the crime scene may have been contaminated or tampered with.</P>

<P>Neufeld also challenged Cellmark's statistical calculations on the grounds that its database relied only on DNA taken from several hundred people in Detroit. The lab's database of African-Americans was obtained from the Detroit Red Cross and consists of 240 African-Americans. Neufeld wanted to know how Cotton could get numbers in the billions from such a database.</P>

<P>The statistics are calculated by multiplying the frequency with which genetically independent markers appear in an individual's DNA, which is found in every cell in the body.</P>

<P>Cotton explained that in addition to the Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) test results, another DNA test called Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) analysis showed that Simpson's DNA banding pattern appeared to match DNA from a blood drop near the victims' bodies, a drop from the Bundy Drive walkway leading to the rear of the residence, as well as a blood drop from driveway of Simpson's home.</P>

<P>And PCR tests also indicated that the nail scrapings and clippings from Nicole Simpson's body appeared to be her own. </P>

<P>Defense attorneys have contended, since the start of the case, that the blood found under Nicole Simpson's fingernails contains blood from an unknown assailant.</P>

<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P><B>MAY 12</B> - The defense continued its cross-examination of a forensic scientist who offered powerful testimony linking O.J. Simpson to the murders of his former wife and her friend.</P>

<P>Defense lawyer Peter Neufeld tried to undermine the evidence on several grounds in order to bolster the defense claim that the statistics overstate the significance of the "matches" and that the samples tested were tainted. </P>

<P>Neufeld continued to ask Dr. Robin Cotton, the laboratory director of Cellmark Diagnostics, if she knew whether certain scientists who disagree with DNA statistics are not accepted within the scientific community. </P>

<P>During the day, Neufeld tried to get Cotton to testify that police criminalists improperly collected the evidence, thereby tainting the DNA evidence. Neufeld apparently wanted to get across the idea that moisture and heat had degraded the DNA in such a way as to give wrong readings. But because Cellmark only tested the evidence after someone else collected it, Judge Lance Ito did not give Neufeld much leeway in questioning Cotton about the collection procedures. Cotton did admit that putting bloodstains in plastic bags and leaving swatches in a locked truck without air conditioning would not be her first choice of procedure. She also suggested that real harm would only be caused if the evidence was treated this way for an extended period of time.</P>

<P>Neufeld also raised the possibility that a bloodstain on the steering wheel of Simpson's Ford Bronco may have been left by a mystery killer. According to Cotton, the blood was a mixture of two people's DNA. Simpson and his former wife were a possible source, but one genetic marker in the blood was from an unknown source. Neufeld used this opportunity to raise the conspiracy angle by asking Cotton whether someone could have touched Simpson's blood, touched Nicole Simpson's blood and then touched the steering wheel. Judge Ito sustained a prosecution objection to the question.</P>

<H2>Week by Week in the O.J. Simpson Criminal Trial</H2>

<H3>Week 17 (May 15 - 19, 1995)</H3>

<P><B>MAY 15</B> - The defense continued its attack against damaging DNA test results by again suggesting blood stains were contaminated and by questioning the competency of the testing laboratory. </P>

<P>Dr. Robin Cotton of Cellmark Diagnostics conceded that her laboratory in the past had twice made false matches in DNA testing due to sample handling error or cross-contamination, in which blood from one sample was inadvertently mixed with blood from another. </P>

<P>Testifying for a sixth day, Cotton also disclosed that some data used for comparisons in the Simpson case included tests on only two other blacks. Cotton explained that in calculating the rarity of Simpson's genetic profile, she relied on five genetic markers or "loci."</P>

<P>"And so in your data base, the number of people that you have typed like Mr. Simpson across all five loci is just two people, isn't that right?" defense attorney Peter Neufeld asked.</P>

<P>"Across all five, yes," Cotton said.</P>

<P>Although the sample of only two blacks who were tested for all of the same genetic markers as Simpson was very small, Cotton said, "I don't think that's a critical feature."</P>

<P>Neufeld repeatedly questioned Cotton about Cellmark's procedures in an effort to raise doubts about the test results.</P>

<P>Cotton acknowledged that two errors were caught in 1988 and 1989. She noted the errors happened during quality-control tests -- not actual DNA cases -- and said Cellmark has undergone more than 100 quality-control tests without mishaps since then.</P>

<P>Neufeld suggested the lack of oversight for procedures at Cellmark cast doubt on the trustworthiness of its results, but Cotton held firm. </P>

<P>"Would you agree ... that you really have no scientific basis for estimating your laboratory's error rate?" Neufeld pressed.</P>

<P>"No, I don't agree with that," Cotton said.</P>

<P>At one point during the testimony, Judge Lance Ito lost his temper with Neufeld and Cotton, telling the lawyer and witness to stop arguing with one another and talking at the same time.</P>

<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P><B>MAY 16</B> - The prosecution introduced scientific evidence linking O.J. Simpson to the murder of Ronald Goldman.</P>

<P>The state's second DNA witness told jurors that the blood taken from the glove found on Simpson's estate matched Goldman's blood. This was the first time jurors heard about the alleged blood match since opening statements.</P>

<P>The witness, Gary Sims, a senior criminalist with the California Department of Justice's DNA laboratory, also testified that DNA tests showed blood on the socks found in Simpson's bedroom matched Nicole Brown Simpson's blood. About 20 stains were found on each sock. Sims is expected to testify Wednesday about the frequencies concerning blood from the socks and from the glove. He is also expected to testify about blood stains found in Simpson's Ford Bronco.</P>

<P>Like the previous witness, Dr. Robin Cotton of Cellmark Diagnostics, Sims testified about RFLP testing. But the RFLP tests done at the California lab were different from the tests conducted at Cellmark. The prosecution hopes having blood matches from two different labs, which conducted two different tests, will strengthen the impact of the genetic evidence.</P>

<P>Sims, a criminalist for 19 years, joined the Department of Justice in 1990. He helped establish the department's DNA lab and has previously testified eight times about DNA results.</P>

<P>Lawyers spent part of the day arguing -- outside the presence of the jury -- about the prosecution's desire to elicit testimony from Sims that the defense had ample opportunity to conduct DNA tests on the blood samples. Over defense objections, Judge Lance Ito allowed Prosecutor Rockne Harmon to ask Sims several questions on the subject. Sims said the lab tested 108 samples in the case, including substrate controls. Of those, Sims said only a few samples were totally consumed. As a result, the prosecution argues the defense could have tested the rest of the samples. The state wants the jury to wonder -- if the defense has problems with the DNA results -- where are the defense's own results?</P>

<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P><B>MAY 17</B> - The prosecution tried to pull together its "trail of blood" theory by presenting evidence found in the Ford Bronco, O.J. Simpson's bedroom and from the crime scene.</P>

<P>The most significant evidence presented by scientist Gary Sims was that blood consistent with Simpson's and the two victims was found inside the Bronco.</P>

<P>Three stains lifted from the center console of the vehicle appeared to be mixtures of blood containing the genetic patterns of Simpson, Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman, Sims said. Another stain on the center console had the genetic material of Simpson and Goldman and a stain on the driver-side carpet showed Nicole Simpson's genetic pattern. Two other other stains only had Simpson's genetic signature, Sims added.</P>

<P>The testimony was the first time anyone has suggested that Goldman's blood was in the Ford Bronco, which the state believes Simpson drove on the night of the murders. </P>

<P>Sims, a top scientist from the California Department of Justice's DNA laboratory, was testifying for a second day. He did not offer any statistics showing how many other people had the same genetic patterns as those found in the blood stains.</P>

<P>Concerning the glove found on Simpson's property, Sims testified about ten bloodstains, including a stain inside the glove that matched Goldman's blood. According to Sims, the blood of Simpson and the two victims was all over the glove, with most stains being a mixture. </P>

<P>Sims also offered important testimony about the location of the blood found on the socks. Sims testified that blood consistent with Nicole Simpson's was found near the ankle area. The prosecution believes that if someone is wearing pants and shoes and walking through blood, the splatter would hit the area of the sock that is exposed -- the ankle. In addition, blood consistent with Simpson's was found in the toe area. The prosecution believes the blood got there when Simpson took off the sock with his cut, bleeding finger.</P>

<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P><B>MAY 18</B> - The genetic-match statistics in the O.J. Simpson trial soared to unbelievable levels based on the combined test results from two laboratories that conducted DNA tests on bloodstains from the crime scenes.</P>

<P>Gary Sims, a criminalist with the state Department of Justice, used DNA test results from both his lab and Cellmark Diagnostics to increase the odds that Simpson's blood was left at the crime scene, and that Nicole Brown Simpson's blood was on a sock found in Simpson's house.</P>

<P>Sims put the combined-test odds that it was someone's other than Simpson's blood found near the bodies of Nicole Simpson and Ronald Goldman at 1out of 240,000. That is an increase from the previously expressed odds of 1 out of 5,200 on the basis of testing done at Cellmark Diagnostics.</P>

<P>The numbers show how many people have a certain type of DNA pattern, and are used to help narrow the possibility that a particular person's known genetic signature matches that of a collected stain.</P>

<P>The chances that it was someone other than Nicole Simpson's blood on the sock found at the foot of Simpson's bed soared to an astronomical level -- the combined calculations being 1 out of 21 billion, Sims said. By comparison, Cellmark put the calculation at 1 out of 9.7 billion.</P>

<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P><B>MAY 19</B> - On what would have been Nicole Brown Simpson's 36th birthday, the prosecution described in gruesome detail its verson of how she was killed.</P>

<P>Assistant district attorney Brian Kelberg said that O.J. Simpson incapacitated his ex-wife with blows to the head and at least four stab wounds. As she lay facedown, he grabbed her by the hair with his left hand, put his foot on her back, pulled her head up and cut her throat left to right, severing the carotid artery, Kelberg said.</P>

<P>In arguing over the admissibility of 40 to 50 autopsy photos, Kelberg said the cut was so deep it partially severed her vertebrae, Kelberg said, in arguing over the admissibility of 40 to 50 autopsy photos. </P>

<P>The jury, which was not present for this description, needs to see the autopsy photos because they prove the killings were committed by someone in a rage, such as an abusive ex-husband, Kelberg argued.</P>

<P>Defense lawyers Robert Shapiro and Gerald Uelmen argued that the photos would "inflame the passions" of jurors and could cause them to render a verdict based on emotion rather than evidence. The defense said the photos do not add anything to the purpose of coroner testimony, which is to establish the time and cause of death.</P>

<P>Judge Lance Ito said he will rule Wednesday or Thursday on this matter. If he allows the photos, they will be placed on boards in front of the jury box. They will not be placed on the overhead projector, and they will not be allowed to be shown by the media.</P>

<P>In the morning, defense lawyer Barry Scheck continued his cross-examination of Gary Sims, a forensic chemist with the California Justice Department, by trying to show the blood evidence was contaminated, thus invalidating DNA results.</P>

<P>Sims agreed with Scheck that a minuscule amount of blood is needed to create a DNA sample. The DNA test known as RFLP can be done with as little as 50 nanograms of blood, and perhaps less. A drop of blood has about 1,000 nanograms.</P>

<P>Even smaller amounts of blood are necessary for PCR, another DNA test.</P>

<P>Establishing the extremely sensitive nature of such testing, Scheck argued that the sloppy work habits of the Los Angeles police, including the use of unclean gloves and unsanitized tools, contaminated the blood samples. </P>

<P>At the end of the session, Scheck tried to point out that blood could have been contaminated or planted without Sims knowing it. </P>

<P>"Do you know from your own personal knowledge how and when that blood got on the sock," Scheck asked, asserting the defense theory of a police conspiracy. Sims said no.</P>

<P>Before the jury were sent away for the weekend, they sent a note to Judge Ito requesting that court hours be increased to a full day Friday and a half day Saturday.</P>

<P>At the end of the day, prosecutor Rock Harmon told Judge Ito that a photo taken June 13, the day members of the defense team visited the crime scene, reveals a blood spot on the back gate that did not appear in a July 3 photo, suggesting that the defense may be concealing evidence, an assertion that Scheck denied.</P>

<P>Judge Ito ordered defense lawyer Carl Douglas to review defense records and report his findings Monday.</P>

<H2>Week by Week in the O.J. Simpson Criminal Trial</H2>

<H3>Week 18 (May 22 - 26, 1995)</H3>

<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P><B>MAY 22</B> - In a series of complex hypothetical questions, defense lawyer Barry Scheck tried to prove that DNA testing can be imprecise and that the results are open to interpretation.</P>

<P>Scheck asked Gary Sims, a forensic chemist with the California Justice Department, to interpret the number of blue dots on different DNA tests to show that the DNA in the prosecution's blood evidence varies greatly.</P>

<P>Scheck argued that divergent DNA levels suggest that police work was sloppy and that some of the evidence may have been planted.</P>

<P>The greatest amount of DNA was found on a blood drop labeled evidence item 52, Sims said. The presence of one blue dot -- which designated a portion of Ronald Goldman's DNA -- was so unusually high that the lab repeated the test.</P>

<P>Scheck suggested that Goldman's genetic marker kept showing up when it should not have. Sims said that he believed the test results were valid and correctly interpreted.</P>

<P>Scheck's complex questioning seemed to confuse the courtroom. Judge Lance Ito sustained several prosecution objections. At one point, Judge Ito asked Sims, "Do you understand the factors involved in the question?"</P>

<P>"About half of it," Sims said.</P>

<P>To keep up morale on the jury, which has been sequestered for 133 days, the judge arranged over the weekend for members to see a stage performance of "Miss Saigon"and ride on the Goodyear Blimp. With the trial plodding along in recent weeks, members of the jury have appeared sleepy and inattentive to the proceedings.</P>

<P>It was announced later in the day that an ex-juror, Michael Knox, was cleared to publish his memoirs of his involvement in the case. Federal Judge Manuel Real issued a preliminary injunction blocking a new California law that restricts jurors from writing about pending trials.</P>

<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P><B>MAY 23</B> - The prosecution continued to present its damaging scientific evidence against O.J. Simpson as a third DNA expert testified about blood stains linking Simpson to the murders.</P>

<P>Renee Montgomery, a criminalist with the state Department of Justice DNA lab, performed the newest of the DNA tests applied to evidence in this case, a test known as "D1S80." The test is a cutting-edge form of PCR analysis.</P>

<P>Montgomery explained to jurors how the test works, and defended the tests' reliability and accuracy of the testing procedure during cross-examination by defense attorney Robert Blasier.</P>

<P>Under questioning by Prosecutor Rockne Harmon, Montgomery reviewed previously disclosed test results of stains from the Bundy Drive scene; the Ford Bronco; and his Rockingham estate.</P>

<P>The testimony included findings that:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Three drops of blood in a bloody trail leading away from the victims' and three stains found on an iron gate outside Nicole Brown Simpson's Brentwood townhouse could all have been deposited by Simpson.<P>

	<LI>Nicole Simpson and Ronald Goldman could not have contributed to the stains or the blood drops.<P>

	<LI>The blood stains from the Bronco showed a mixture that contained the DNA patterns of Simpson, his ex-wife, and Goldman.<P>

	<LI>Stains on the bloody glove found behind Simpson's home also contained the DNA patterns of all three, with Goldman appearing to be the main contributor of the blood.<P>

	<LI>The DNA in the blood found on a pair of socks in Simpson's bedroom matched Nicole Simpson's DNA pattern.
</UL>

<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P><B>MAY 24</B> - A prosecution witness said that at the time he performed the first DNA tests in the O.J. Simpson case he thought the former football player had an "airtight alibi," a response that may score a major victory for the defense by allowing them to introduce Simpson's June 13 statement to police.</P>

<P>Entering the statement would allow Simpson to tell his story to the jury without having to take the stand and face cross-examination.</P>

<P>Prosecutor Rockne Harmon was apparently trying to refute the defense theory that investigators had preconceived notions of Simpson's guilt when he asked LAPD criminalist Collin Yamauchi, "Did you have any expectation what the outcome of these tests would be?"</P>

<P>"I heard on the news that, well, yeah, he's got an airtight alibi, he's in Chicago," Yamauchi said.</P>

<P>With this testimony, Judge Lance Ito called a sidebar. Later, when the jury was excused, Simpson's lawyers argued that the alibi reference should allow them to present Simpson's statement to the jury.</P>

<P>Under section 356 of the California Evidence Code, "When part of a . . . conversation is given by one party, the whole on the same subject may be inquired into by an adverse party . . ."</P>

<P>Referring to Yamauchi's testimony, defense lawyer Johnnie Cochran said, "They [the prosecution] brought it out to the jury, and now we think we have a right to bring out Mr. Simpson's entire statement."</P>

<P>The prosecution opened the door with "a Mack truck" Cochran told Judge Ito, "and we think we can walk through it."</P>

<P>Prosecutor Marcia Clark argued that Yamauchi's testimony was not based on a knowledge of Simpson's statement. "The witness is talking about his state of mind and what he concludes from a news report," she said.</P>

<P>Judge Ito told both sides to prepare Thursday for arguments on this matter.</P>

<P>In the morning, California Department of Justice criminalist Renee Montgomery finished her testimony, saying she was confident with the DNA test results. She answered attacks on cross-examination from Robert Blasier with clear descriptions of complex science issues.</P>

<P>Yamauchi is scheduled to return to the stand Thursday and is expected to testify about blood found on Simpson's driveway and in his Ford Bronco. Since he was the first to test much of the key evidence, the defense is likely to attempt to prove that he is inexperienced and contaminated evidence.</P>

<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P><B>MAY 25</B> - The threat of a mistrial loomed larger Thursday after another juror was dismissed from the panel.</P>

<P>Judge Lance Ito removed the juror after meeting with lawyers for more than five hours. Another juror will be chosen at the beginning of Friday's court session.</P>

<P>Five alternate jurors remain from the pool of 12 alternates originally chosen. Many legal experts following the trial believe closing statements will not begin until at least September, providing that there are still enough jurors to continue.</P>

<P>The dismissed juror was not identified. She is a 38-year-old white woman. The court gave no explanation for the action.</P>

<P>Some news organizations identified the woman as the one who allegedly kicked another dismissed juror, Jeanette Harris, in a racially charged confrontation.</P>

<P>The woman was also described as the leader of the jury revolt last month, when many of the panel refused for a day to attend court in protest of Judge Ito's removal of three sheriff's deputies assigned to jury detail.</P>

<P>CBS-TV reported that the woman was writing a book and had "some sort of book contract."</P>

<P>Earlier in court, the jury got its first close look at the black sock that prosecutors claim Simpson wore June 12, the day Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman were killed.</P>

<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P><B>MAY 26</B> - The defense suffered a setback when Judge Lance Ito ruled it could not introduce O.J. Simpson's police interview during their questioning of a police criminalist, who testified he once thought Simpson had an "airtight alibi."</P>

<P>"I don't find that the statement by Mr. (Collin) Yamauchi . . . directly refers to any statement made by Mr. Simpson to detectives (Tom) Lange and (Philip) Vannatter," Judge Lance Ito ruled after listening to arguments for nearly an hour.</P>

<P>Meanwhile, the jury underwent another change. A 71-year-old black woman was seated to replace a white woman juror. The excused juror had been the focus of bitter complaints by former juror Jeanette Harris, and she was one of the jurors who took part in a revolt last month.</P>

<P>The new juror, a retired cleaning officer, replaced the white telephone company worker. She was removed from the panel Thursday night. Judge Ito did not give any reason other than "good cause" for the juror's removal.</P>

<P>The jury now consists of eight blacks, two whites and two Hispanics. There are still nine women and three men on the panel. The alternate pool of four, which started at 12, now consists of three blacks and one white -- three women and one man.</P>

<H2>Week by Week in the O.J. Simpson Criminal Trial</H2>

<H3>Week 19 (May 30 - June 2, 1995)</H3>

<P><B>MAY 30</B> - With the threat of losing more jurors hanging over the trial, defense attorney Barry Scheck's cross examination of a police criminalist focused on the defense theme that sloppy police and laboratory work contaminated the key evidence in the case.</P>

<P>Scheck also tried to ask Collin Yamauchi about a statement O.J. Simpson gave police on June 13, 1994. The questions prompted Prosecutor Marcia Clark to attack Scheck and ask the judge to issue sanctions against the defense attorney.</P>

<P>Scheck spent the day pecking away at numerous areas of perceived weakness in the handling of evidence. He tried to show that Yamauchi did not change gloves before handling different pieces of evidence, failed to adequately document blood testing and generally did not follow rules designed to safeguard against contaminating the blood.</P>

<P>Scheck may have made his strongest point at the end of four hours of questioning. Yamauchi conceded that he did not see blood spots on the socks, recovered from O.J. Simpson's bedroom, on June 29, 1994. He also said he did not see any reddish powder on the laboratory paper that had been placed underneath the socks.</P>

<P>While the testimony supports the prosecuton theory that the blood stains were not easily visible, it also supports the defense argument that the criminalists did not see the blood because it wasn't yet on the socks. The defense wants the jury to believe the blood was planted on the socks at a later date.</P>

<P>Under persistent questioning Yamauchi also said he suddenly remembered he got blood on his plastic gloves last summer while handling a vial holding Simpson's sample.</P>

<P>Scheck then tried to show that Yamauchi could have transferred Simpson's blood from his hand to other evidence, including a glove found on Simpson's estate. But the effort was hampered by Yamauchi's failure to record the time that he processed each piece of evidence, so it was unknown whether he handled the glove before or after he handled the vial.</P>

<P>Yamauchi said the last thing he did was write his initials on the glove, an action Scheck indicated would require him to grip the glove by its wrist notch -- the only area where Simpson's blood was found.</P>

<P>The fireworks of the day occcured when Scheck tried to elicit testimony from Yamauchi about Simpson's June 13 statement to police. Judge Lance Ito had ruled Friday that Yamauchi's testimony had not opened the door to the defense to introduce the statement. So Scheck tried to bring in some of the statement through a series of questions to Yamauchi.</P>

<P>Yamauchi said criminalist Dennis Fung, who had talked with detectives, told him in advance that Simpson had a cut on his hand which might be connected to the slayings. But when Scheck asked Yamauchi if he knew the detectives had taken a statement from Simpson, Judge Ito sustained a prosecution objection.</P>

<P>Moments later, with the jury of out the courtroom, prosecutor Marcia Clark ripped into Scheck, saying, "no lawyer with half a brain or an IQ about 5" would have asked that question. She demanded that Scheck be sanctioned and reported to the California bar. Scheck did not respond to the personal attack but insisted the question was proper.</P>

<P>Judge Ito disagreed, telling Scheck to cease that line of questioning.</P>

<P>"To couch your questions in terms of a statement you cannot bring in through this witness is unduly confusing and time-consuming, isn't it?" the judge said.</P>

<P>In other developments:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>There were indications that two jurors were being investigated and that one is about to be dismissed. One juror allegedly is being investigated for passing a note to Francine Florio-Bunten, the juror who was dismissed last week. The note may have concerned Florio-Bunten's alleged deal to write a book.<P>

	<LI>In a memo to attorneys, Judge Ito proposed longer court hours to speed up the trial's pace. Court would run from 9am to 6pm three days a week. The judge rejected a jury request for Saturday sessions, saying it would be far too costly.<P>

	<LI>Defense attorney Johnnie Cochran Jr. denied tabloid newspaper reports that the Simpson defense is negotiating a plea bargain. "There are not now, nor have there been, nor will there be any plea bargaining discussions in this case," he said.
</UL>

<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P><B>MAY 31</B> - The prosecution won a major victory when Judge Lance Ito ruled that most of the autopsy photos of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman could be shown to the jury.</P>

<P>The judge described some of the photographs as "horrible" and "terrible" but said their probative value outweighed any potential prejudice.</P>

<P>The defense had argued that the pictures would cause "revulsion and horror" in jurors. "It's unlikely anyone would look at these photos and not get sick to their stomach," defense attorney Robert Shapiro argued during a hearing earlier this month.</P>

<P>The prosecution argued the photos will help jurors understand how the murders were committed. The prosecution has theorized that Simpson killed his former wife while she was face down on the ground by pulling back her head and slashing her throat. Goldman also was killed by a neck wound.</P>

<P>In his nine-page ruling, Judge Ito said the jury could see 40 of the 44 photographs -- 23 of 26 photos of Goldman and 17 of 18 photographs of Nicole Simpson.</P>

<P>Several of the photographs of Nicole Simpson show how the murderer slashed her throat. The autopsy photos of Goldman include those depicting knife wounds across most of his body.</P>

<P>In making his ruling, the judge determined that the photos will help the jury understand numerous factors. These include the number of weapons used in the attacks; the time of death; whether the victims struggled with their attacker, and whether the killings were premeditated.</P>

<P>Meanwhile, criminalist Collin Yamauchi returned to the witness stand for a fifth day as testimony focused on his feelings towards defense DNA expert Dr. Henry Lee.</P>

<P>Defense attorney Barry Scheck tried to cast doubt on Yamauchi's earlier testimony that he did not see Lee change gloves when he inspected blood-stained socks in February at the Los Angeles police department laboratory.</P>

<P>At one point, Scheck asked, "You have no feelings of resentment or irritation with Dr. Lee at all?"</P>

<P>"No," Yamauchi answered. "Actually he seems like a nice, congenial man."</P>

<P>Yamauchi was the first technician to conduct sophisticated DNA tests on evidence gathered at Simpson's home and the crime scene where Nicole Simpson and Goldman were slain.</P>

<P>Scheck was given 10 minutes this morning to conclude his cross-examination of Yamauchi after telling the judge he forgot a few questions.</P>

<P>Under redirect examination by prosecutor Rockne Harmon, Yamauchi denied he held any animosity toward Lee.</P>

<P>Asked why he pointed out in his notes that Lee did not change gloves during the examination, Yamauchi said: "Basically he has a good reputation, and he handles evidence in the same fashion we do."</P>

<P>Yamauchi also denied being part of a police conspiracy to frame Simpson.</P>

<P>After Yamauchi concluded his testimony, California Department of Justice senior criminalist Gary Sims resumed his testimony, and the jurors got the chance to act as criminalists.</P>

<P>During Harmon's re-direct examination of Sims, the jurors were asked to step out of the jury box and one by one look through a crime lab microscope at a "reddish" substance on one of the socks found in Simpson's home. The prosecution was trying to show why no criminalist initially saw blood on either of the socks: the stains were not visible to the naked eye and only could be seen with the use of a microscope.</P>

<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P><B>JUNE 1</B> - The scientific evidence phase of the trial ended as the state prepared to begin offering the autopsy results of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman.</P>

<P>The Los Angeles County coroner is scheduled to testify Friday. He is to be followed by the Deputy Medical Examiner, Dr. Irwin Golden, who performed the autopsies on Nicole Simpson and Goldman.</P>

<P>Judge Lance Ito recessed court early after defense attorney Barry Scheck finished questioning a state DNA expert about the blood stains found on the rear gate of Nicole Simpson's condominium.</P>

<P>California Department of Justice scientist Gary Sims acknowledged that foliage can contaminate samples. He noted that plants can be seen brushing against the condo's rear gate in photos taken of the scene. But, he added, he did not see any plant material or bacterial contamination of blood samples taken from the back gate three weeks after the killings. Scheck suggested this was odd since samples collected from the front walkway the day after the killings showed substantial bacterial degradation associated with plants and soil.</P>

<P>The defense claims the gate blood, which matched Simpson's DNA type, was intentionally placed there after the first evidence was collected June 13. The gate blood was collected July 3.</P>

<P>In other developments:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>A hearing was scheduled in Kansas City to determine whether Kansas City Chiefs running back Marcus Allen should be required to appear in Los Angeles to testify. The defense alleges that Simpson apparently forgave Allen for having an affair with his former wife and even allowed Allen to use the Simpson mansion for his wedding. Allen has denied having an affair with Nicole Simpson.<P>

	<LI>Judge Ito spent 90 minutes in chambers with lawyers to discuss new allegations of juror misconduct. At least two more jurors are believed to be under investigation. There are only four remaining alternate jurors. Defense attorney Johnnie Cochran Jr. said the defense would be willing to continue the trial with fewer than 12 jurors. The prosecution has not commented on that issue.
</UL>

<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P><B>JUNE 2</B> - Los Angeles County Coroner Lakshmanan Sathyavagiswaran took the witness stand as the prosecution started to introduce the autopsy results.</P>

<P>Sathyavagiswaran acknowledged that one of his deputy medical examiners, Dr. Irwin Golden, made some mistakes while performing the autopsies on Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman.</P>

<P>The defense is expected to attack the findings of Golden, who is expected to be the next witness. The defense has suggested more than one weapon was used in the fatal stabbings and that there could be more than one killer.</P>

<P>The defense also contends Golden's failure to save Nicole Simpson's stomach contents eliminated one way of double-checking the prosecution's estimate of the times of the murders. Golden also failed to note some of the victims' wounds in his autopsy reports, and an internal coroner's office memorandum listed a number of other potential problems with the way evidence was handled.</P>

<P>Meanwhile, Judge Lance Ito told the jurors that they can ask for breaks and leave the courtroom if graphic autopsy photos make them too uncomfortable. The judge ruled earlier this week that prosecutors could show more than 40 autopsy photos to the jury.</P>

<H2>Week by Week in the O.J. Simpson Criminal Trial</H2>



<H3>Week 20 (June 5 - 9, 1995)</H3>



<P><B>JUNE 5</B> - Judge Lance Ito dismissed two more jurors, leaving only two alternates in the case that could last several more months.</P>



<P>The defense filed an emergency appeal asking a California appeals court to reinstate one of the jurors. The court denied the motion on the grounds that trial judges enjoy almost absolute discretion in removing jurors. The defense had accused the prosecution of engineering the removal of black jurors to gain an unfair tactical advantage and "ultimately to secure a mistrial."</P>



<P>The latest furor over the embattled jury panel prompted Judge Ito to suspend testimony until Tuesday. He also delayed ruling on O.J. Simpson's request to be absent from the court during testimony about the autopsies on Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman.</P>



<P>The dismissed jurors -- a 28-year-old female real estate appraiser and a 54-year-old male postal operations manager -- had reportedly been under scrutiny for some time.</P>



<P>The female panelist had been investigated for passing a note to Francine Florio-Bunten, the juror who was dismissed late last month. The note may have concerned Florio-Bunten's alleged deal to write a book. The male juror had reportedly been the subject of complaints from other panelists that he was a bully.</P>



<P>Judge Ito will name replacements for the dismissed panelists on Tuesday, when Los Angeles Medical Examiner Dr. Lakshmanan Sathyavagiswaran is expected to resume his testimony.</P>



<P>In asking that Simpson be excused from court during the autopsy evidence, defense attorney Johnnie Cochran Jr. said, "Mr. Simpson does not want to hear that testimony. He does not plan to look at the photographs. This is very difficult for those who loved these people."</P>



<P>Deputy District Attorney Marcia Clark said case law allows Simpson to be absent during the grisly displays, but stressed she didn't want him leaving in the middle of the testimony.</P>



<P>"In that manner," she told Judge Ito, "the court will ensure that the proceedings are respectful and not turned into a circus sideshow for maudlin displays by the defendant and that he can preserve his right, exercise his right to be absent in the appropriate manner that shows proper respect for these proceedings."</P>



<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>

<P><B>JUNE 6</B> - The jury saw the first of the grisly autopsy photographs of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman and heard detailed testimony about the murders.</P>



<P>Los Angeles County Medical Examiner Dr. Lakshmanan Sathyavagiswaran also testified about mistakes made by Dr. Irwin Golden, who performed the autopsies. But Dr. Sathyagiswaran said the minor mistakes did not change his opinion about the cause and manner of the deaths.</P>



<P>Meanwhile, Judge Lance Ito named two black women to the jury to to replace the jurors dismissed Monday. The jury now has nine blacks, two whites and one Hispanic. There are now ten women and two men.</P>



<P>In another jury-related matter, the judge scheduled a hearing for June 16 to look into defense claims that prosecutors are targeting black jurors for dismissal from the panel.</P>



<P>The jury and two remaining alternates heard Dr. Sathyavagiswaran offer a detailed description of how Nicole Simpson and Goldman died.</P>



<P>The jury was shown a dozen photographs of Nicole Simpson's body on a diagram board angled so that no courtroom spectators could see them.</P>



<P>The medical examiner then graphically described a photograph that showed Nicole Brown Simpson's face above a gaping neck wound exposing a part of her spinal chord.</P>



<P>He said the photos helped prove the theory that Nicole Simpson bled to death and was probably on the ground, face-down and unconscious, when her killer pulled back her head by the hair and slit her throat.</P>



<P>To demonstrate, the coroner grabbed a chunk of prosecutor Brian Kelberg's hair, pulled Kelberg's head back and brought his hand across the prosecutor's throat with a ruler to show the left-to-right slashing motion of the knife.</P>



<P>The pathologist also showed jurors four knives and described how the same sort of knife could cause various sizes and types of injuries. He testified that the nearly 30 stab wounds inflicted on the victims all could have come from the same single-edged knife. But he also conceded that he could not rule out a double-edged knife as a possible murder weapon..</P>



<P>Dr. Sathyavagiswaran conceded that Dr. Irwin Golden, who performed the autopsies, made as many as 30 errors. The errors included Golden's failure to record an injury on Nicole Simpson's brain; the mislabeling of a sample of Goldman's bile as urine; the failure to document several tears on Goldman's shirt and jeans; and the failure to take a palm print from Nicole Simpson's left hand.</P>



<P>The questioning was clearly an attempt by prosecutors to pre-empt attacks by the defense on the competence of Dr. Golden.</P>



<P>During the testimony, Simpson rocked quietly in his chair although his view of the photographs was obscured from his seat at the defense table. He had asked to be absent from the courtroom during the autopsy testimony but stayed nevertheless.</P>



<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>

<P><B>JUNE 7</B> - Nicole Brown Simpson was probably knocked unconscious in a struggle before her assailant turned to Ronald Goldman and killed him, according to Los Angeles coroner Dr. Lakshmanan Sathyavagiswaran, testifying Wednesday for the prosecution.</P>



<P>As Nicole Simpson lay face down on the ground, the assailant returned to her, yanked her hair to pull her head back, and slit her throat, according to Dr. Sathyavagiswaran's theory, which is based on autopsies of the victims.</P>



<P>It was Dr. Sathyavagiswaran's third day of testimony, and the jury was shown more gruesome autopsy photos and heard graphic descriptions of the murders.</P>



<P>The prosecution continued its painstakingly detailed direct examination in an attempt to preempt the defense's anticipated cross-examination regarding Dr. Sathyavagiswaran's subordinate, deputy coroner Irwin Golden.</P>



<P>With diagrams and a pointer, Dr. Sathyavagiswaran described the victim's wounds and how they were inflicted. At times, he used prosecutor Brian Kelberg as a model to show how a killer could have slashed and stabbed Nicole Brown's neck. Dr. Sathyavagiswaran clenched an imaginary knife in his hand and made a stabbing motion at the right side of Kelberg's neck.</P>



<P>On the night of her murder, Nicole Simpson tried to fight back, Dr. Sathyavagiswaran concluded from the cuts and bruises on her hands. The blow to the head she received not only knocked her out, it bruised her brain, he said.</P>



<P>When her neck was slit, he said, she was probably face down because she did not swallow blood through her air pipe. The fatal wound was probably inflicted by a right-handed person using a single-edged knife, he said.</P>



<P>Dr. Sathyavagiswaran acknowledged several mistakes made by Golden. He downplayed them, saying they were insignificant because they didn't affect the manner or cause of death.</P>



<P>For a third time, Judge Lance Ito told jurors that they could ask for breaks if the autopsy photos disturbed them. No juror asked for one. The judge admonished members of the court audience for "contorting" themselves, apparently either to see the autopsy photos or the jury's reaction to them.</P>



<P>O.J. Simpson, seated at the defense table throughout the day, could not see the photographs, which were displayed on an easel visible to the jury and a few reporters.</P>



<P>Also Wednesday, the defense witness list shrank after Mary Anne Gerchas pleaded guilty in a Los Angeles court to three felony theft charges. She was expected to testify that she saw three men near the crime scene on the night of the murders. Gerchas faces up to six years and four months in prison.</P>



<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>

<P><B>JUNE 8</B> - The court day abruptly ended when one juror appeared close to breaking down as a coroner described the horrifying death of Ronald Goldman.</P>



<P>The juror, a 37-year-old black woman who sits in the front row of the jury box, left the courtroom during the testimony of Los Angeles County Medical Examiner Dr. Lakshmanan Sathyavagiswaran. The juror was seated immediately in front of the autopsy photos which showed Goldman's brutally slashed body.</P>



<P>Before court ended, the prosecution had started to question Dr. Sathyavagiswaran about the details of how Goldman was killed. Dr. Sathyavagiswaran testified the killer may have held a knife to Goldman's throat, slicing superficial, parallel wounds, while threatening him. He also testified that it could have taken a man of O.J. Simpson's strength and size less than a minute to inflict the wounds on Goldman.</P>



<P>The doctor told prosecutor Brian Kelberg that he believed the killer was holding Goldman from behind and sliced a knife lightly across his throat before inflicting a final gash that severed Goldman's jugular vein and damaged his aorta.</P>



<P>Before the testimony turned to Goldman's death, Kelberg spent much of the day again going over the mistakes in the autopsy performed by Dr. Irwin Golden on Nicole Brown Simpson.</P>



<P>Dr. Sathyavagiswaran defended Dr. Golden's decision not to examine Nicole Simpson for signs of sexual assault. "I didn't feel it was necessary," he said, because the circumstances surrounding her death suggested that rape was not a motive.</P>



<P>"She was fully clothed," he said. "The intimate apparel were in place."</P>



<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>

<P><B>JUNE 9</B> - The Los Angeles County coroner continued his gruesome descriptions of the fatal stab wounds to Ronald Goldman as the judge cautioned jurors not to be swayed by their feelings.</P>



<P>"In evaluating the evidence that is presented to you in this case, I want to instruct you that you must not be influenced by mere sentiment, conjecture, sympathy, passion, prejudice, public opinion or public feeling," Judge Lance Ito told the jurors.</P>



<P>The admonition came as Dr. Lakshmanan Sathyavagiswaram testified for a sixth day. He described two gaping slash wounds in Goldman's neck - one six inches long that pierced his jugular vein, the other three inches long.</P>



<P>Goldman's killer, he testified, could have slashed the victim in less than a minute, trapping him in a small gated area of Nicole Brown Simpson's condominium that left him nowhere to run.</P>



<P>"If Mr. Goldman was confronted by the assailant in this confined area, he has no place to escape, especially if he is cornered between that railing and the tree and that sapling," the coroner said. "He's stuck there."</P>



<P>To show the jury how be believed Goldman was attacked, Dr. Sathyavagiswaram held prosecutor Brian Kelberg from behind with his left arm. With his right hand, he drew a ruler, representing a knife, across Kelberg's neck.</P>



<P>Meanwhile, Judge Ito denied a defense request to adjourn court on Monday - the anniversary of the murders.</P>

<H2>Week by Week in the O.J. Simpson Criminal Trial</H2>



<H3>Week 21 (June 12 - 16, 1995)</H3>



<P><B>JUNE 12</B> - On the anniversary of the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman, the prosecution withdrew its plan to call as a witness the controversial pathologist Dr. Irwin Golden, who has been shown to have committed a variety of errors in the autopsies of the two victims.</P>



<P>Instead of calling Golden, prosecutor Brian Kelberg told Judge Lance Ito early Monday that he would continue his direct examination of Golden's supervisor, Los Angeles coroner Dr. Lakshmanan Sathyavagiswaran.</P>



<P>Upon hearing Kelberg's announcement, defense lawyer Robert Shapiro said he planned to subpoena Golden to appear as a witness for the defense.</P>



<P>Golden failed to document injuries or misdescribed them in his autopsy report, according to Dr. Sathyavagiswaran. Golden also failed to preserve the contents of Nicole Simpson's stomach.</P>



<P>Kelberg has elicited testimony about Golden's mistakes from Dr. Sathyavagiswaran apparently in anticipation of the defense trying to prove that sloppy work on the autopsies has led to incorrect conclusions about the double murder.</P>



<P>After pointing out Golden's mistakes, Dr. Sathyavagiswaran downplayed their importance.</P>



<P>The coroner also described more of Goldman's wounds. The defensive wounds to Goldman's hands most likely were caused by Goldman's open hands flailing about, hitting a tree, a gate or a sapling, causing abrasions on top of bruises, he said.</P>



<P>The hand injuries don't appear to be the result of a clenched fist hitting another person, Dr. Sathyavagiswaran said, undermining the defense theory that Goldman punched his assailant. Simpson shows no sign of bruises in photographs taken at the request of his legal team a short time after the murders.</P>



<P>The families of Nicole Simpson and Goldman marked the anniversary of their deaths with candlelight vigils for friends and family in separate ceremonies outside Los Angeles.</P>



<P>Nicole Simpson's father filed a wrongful death suit against O.J. Simpson, charging that the former football star "planned and prepared to assault, batter and murder Nicole Brown Simpson."</P>



<P>The suit, filed in Santa Monica on the last day before the statute of limitations was to run out, asks for unspecified damages. The Goldman family has two similar suits against Simpson.</P>



<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>

<P><B>JUNE 13</B> - One of the alternate jurors was overcome with distress and suddenly left the jury box as a coroner continued his gruesome testimony about the murders.</P>



<P>Dr. Lakshmanan Sathyavagiswaran was demonstrating how the murder weapon was plunged into Ronald Goldman's rib cage when the juror left the courtroom, prompting Judge Lance Ito to call a 25-minute break in the proceedings.</P>



<P>This was the second time that the trial has been interrupted by a juror being overcome during the showing of graphic autopsy photos and detailed testimony about the killings.</P>



<P>Dr. Sathyavagiswaran spent a seventh day on direct examination giving detailed testimony about the 58 autopsy photos and accompanying written reports, reviewing them injury by injury, line by line.</P>



<P>He described three of the fatal stab wounds to Ronald Goldman: two gashes to the chest that cracked through a rib and punctured Goldman's right lung and a third that hit the aorta, the major artery leading from the heart. Earlier, he spoke of a fatal cut across Goldman's neck.</P>



<P>The coroner told jurors that after slashing his throat, Goldman's killer may have poked him in the face at least four, perhaps five times with a knife to see if he was dead.</P>



<P>"They are all superficial punctures, and I have no way of knowing exactly why they were done," the coroner said of the red gashes on the right side of Goldman's face. "It could have been inflicted to check whether he was still alive or not. That would be one conclusion I would draw, also."</P>



<P>Using blowups of autopsy reports, charts showing the victim's head and hands and display boards of autopsy photos, Lakshmanan said Goldman's swollen and bruised knuckles could not have come from punching his assailant. He said the injuries were likely caused by Goldman flailing around while under attack, striking tree branches and stumps in the small, partly enclosed area where he died.</P>



<P>He also conceded that he no longer thinks that his office did a very good job on the autopies. He termed the autopsies adequate in light of the more than 30 errors committed by Dr. Irwin Golden, the deputy medical examiner who performed the autopsies.</P>



<P>Before the day's session opened, defense attorney Robert Shapiro complained that the prosecution was prolonging Lakshmanan's testimony.</P>



<P>"This appears to be an unprecedented marathon, to present evidence that is readily susceptible of reading from a crystal ball," Shapiro told the judge. "The people continue to talk and press and go into minutia and details most people looking at this are mystified by. It's time for your honor to step in and say the jury has enough evidence on the real issues at hand."</P>



<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>

<P><B>JUNE 14</B> - The defense began its cross-examination of Dr. Lakshmanan Sathyavagiswaran by trying to show the coroner could provide only a few definitive facts about the murders. In a tone at times mocking, defense attorney Robert Shapiro pointed out that Dr. Sathyavagiswaran established only four facts during eight days of direct testimony: Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman were murdered; the wounds wer sharp force injuries; the victims' throats were cut; and they bled toi death.</P>



<P>Dr. Sathyavagiswaran conceded he could not, without any degree of medical certainty, say how many people were responsible for the murders or whether only one single-edged knife was used in the attacks.</P>



<P>Near the end of direct testimony, Dr. Sathyavagiswaran testified about the important time of death issue. He said the victims were probably murdered between 9:40pm on June 12, and 12:13 am the next morning, when the bodies were discovered.</P>



<P>The contents of Nicole Simpson's stomach, he explained, suggested that she died between 10pm and 10:30 pm - the time frame presented by prosecutors. He based this conclusion on the fact that Nicole Simpson completed her meal between 8pm and 8:30pm and on the length of time it takes for a stomach to become empty after a meal of pasta and wine. He said general studies show that it can take between 90 minutes and six hours - depending on whether a meal was light, medium or heavy - for food to be digested and the stomach to become empty.</P>



<P>The coroner also acknowledged that he had never testified in a trial where the doctor who performed the autopsy was called as a witness. Shapiro is expected to continue questioning Dr. Sathyavagiswaran about the errors in the autopsy conducted by Dr. Irwin Golden.</P>



<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>

<P><B>JUNE 15</B> - In one of the most dramatic moments of the trial, O.J. Simpson struggled to put on the gloves that prosecutors say he wore to commit the murders.</P>



<P>Simpson first put on latex gloves. When he stood before the jury, he struggled to put the gloves on, often clenching his face in agony to show that the gloves didn't fit.</P>



<P>But did they?</P>



<P>The prosecution did not believe Simpson's performance and asked him to clench his fists and grasp a marker while wearing the gloves. When doing this , the gloves appeared to fit. The prosecution contends that the latex gloves, along with Simpson opening his hands while putting the gloves on gave the impression that the gloves didn't fit.</P>



<P>So while the demonstration may have had a dramatic effect on jurors, many observors believe the prosecution's gamble backfired.</P>



<P>The demonstration came after testimony suggesting that Nicole Brown Simpson bought the unique style of gloves during a 1990 trip to Bloomingdale's in New York. Only about 300 brown, extra-large gloves in that style were ordered by Bloomingdale's for 1990. The store sold between 200 to 240 gloves and returned the rest to the manufacturer.</P>



<P>Deputy District Attorney Christopher Darden had witness Richard Rubin, former vice president and general manager of Aris Isotoner Inc., inspect Simpson's bare hands. Rubin held his hands up to Simpson's, eyeballed his knuckles and declared that Simpson was a size large or extra large.</P>



<P>The gloves police collected after the murders were size extra large.</P>



<P>"At one point in time, those gloves would actually be, I think, large on Mr. Simpson's hands," Rubin told jurors.</P>



<P>After court, defense attorney Johnnie Cochran Jr. said the gloves were too small, and he said his client's struggle was sincere.</P>



<P>"I don't think he could act the size of his hands," Cochran said. "He would be a great actor if he could act his hands larger."</P>



<P>The glove testimony came after defense attorney Robert Shapiro finished his cross-examination of Dr. Lakshmanan Sathyavagiswaran, the Los Angeles County coroner.</P>



<P>Shapiro second-guessed the coroner on just about every aspect of his testimony, including his opinion that the knife wound that killed Nicole Brown and Ronald Goldman came from a right-handed person.</P>



<P>Shapiro also tried to suggest that the injuries on Goldman's body indicated a fierce struggle with his assailant and that the attacker would have had to sustain injuries himself in the process.</P>



<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>

<P><B>JUNE 16</B> - The prosecution scrambled to recover Friday after asking O.J. Simpson to try on the infamous bloody gloves Thursday and they didn't fit. Glove designer Richard Rubin testified that leather gloves shrink when exposed to liquid.</P>



<P>Christopher Darden -- the same prosecutor whose strategy backfired when he asked Simpson to try on the gloves -- elicited testimony that normal exposure would cause two to five percent shrinkage.</P>



<P>Rubin is a former vice president of Aris Isotoner, the company that manufactured the right-handed glove found on Simpson's estate and the left-handed glove found outside Nicole Brown Simpson's condominium after she and Ronald Goldman were murdered.</P>



<P>A saleswoman from Bloomingdale's department store in New York testified Thursday that in December 1990 Nicole Simpson bought two pairs of extra-large Isotoners.</P>



<P>Rubin told the court that if such gloves were severely saturated they could shrink 15 percent.</P>



<P>Over a pair of latex gloves, Rubin tried on the right-handed glove. Though the glove was marked extra-large, Rubin said it had shrunk to "a little bit about average of a large but well below an extra-large."</P>



<P>Under cross-examination, Johnnie Cochran informed Rubin that the glove absorbed only three cubic centimeters of blood, an amount too small to have an effect upon the glove, Rubin said.</P>



<P>Rubin was unable at first to put on the left glove because the lining came out.</P>



<P>With the jury outside the court, Darden asked Judge Lance Ito for permission to question Rubin about the lining to find out if there was anything blocking the fingers.</P>



<P>Defense lawyer Robert Shapiro argued that he had tried on the gloves and there were no impediments. He also said that he witnessed a defense expert dislodge the lining.</P>



<P>After Rubin was allowed to replace the lining he said the glove had shrunk to between a large and extra-large.</P>

<H2>Week by Week in the O.J. Simpson Criminal Trial</H2>



<H3>Week 22 (June 19 - 23, 1995)</H3>



<P><B>JUNE 19</B> - An FBI expert testified that the person who killed Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman wore expensive Italian shoes that are the same size that O.J. Simpson wears.</P>



<P>William Bodziak, a nationally recognized shoe and tire print specialist, said he examined photos of the murder scene and found they were left by a size 12 pair of $160 Bruno Magli shoes.</P>



<P>Though the shoes that left a bloody trial along the walkway of Nicole Brown Simpson's condominium have not been recovered, Bodziak placed a similar pair of Bruno Magli shoes against a pair of O.J. Simpson's Reeboks and said that they were identical in size "for all practical purposes."</P>



<P>"The person wearing one would certainly be a candidate for wearing the other," Bodziak said.</P>



<P>Even though there are two sets of shoe prints leading away from the crime scene, Bodziak said there was no evidence of more than one source for the footprints, supporting the state's theory that there was only one killer.</P>



<P>When Bodziak was called in to investigate in this case, he was unable to match the shoe prints found at the crime to any in the FBI's reference lab, he said. He then began contacting foreign manufacturers and U.S. importers of Italian-style shoes. After a trip to Italy, he determined that the killer wore a Bruno Magli model, size 46 European or 12 U.S.</P>



<P>These shoes are extremely rare. Fewer than 300 size 12 pairs were distributed in the United States. The prosecution has yet to offer proof that Simpson owned such shoes. But Bodziak said that only about 9 percent of the U.S. male population wear size 12 and those people tend to be between six feet and six feet four inches tall. Simpson is six feet two inches tall.</P>



<P>On cross-examination, defense lawyer F. Lee Bailey suggested that anyone who could wear size 12 shoes could have left such footprints and that criminals are inclined to wear larger or smaller shoes to mislead investigators. Bodziak said this was possible but that he had only heard of this type of deception once in his 25-year career.</P>



<P>Wearing ill-fitting shoes would also leave a criminal "stumbling all over the place" when fleeing a crime scene, he said.</P>



<P>Attacking Bodziak's conclusion that one pair of shoe left all the footprints, Bailey said that two people could have been wearing the same type and size shoe to camouflage their crime.</P>



<P>Bodziak dismissed Bailey's theory as "ridiculous." He said many of the prints he examined were distinct and there was nothing to suggest a second pair of shoes.</P>



<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>

<P><B>JUNE 20</B> - Prosecutors dropped plans to present additional testimony on domestic violence. The shift in strategy means prosecutors could end their case by next week.</P>



<P>The state also will not present testimony that blood found on the rear gate of Nicole Brown Simpson's home and on socks found in O.J. Simpson's bedroom did not contain EDTA, a preservative one would have expected had police removed it from a test tube of Simpson's blood and planted it there.</P>



<P>Deputy District Attorney Marcia Clark said prosecutors have presented overwhelming and undeniable proof of Simpson's guilt and that it was time to get the case to the jury.</P>



<P>Her announcement came after an abbreviated court day during which prosecutors returned to the DNA evidence it claims links Simpson to the murders.</P>



<P>Gary Sims, chief DNA analyst at the California Department of Justice Crime Laboratory, who first testified more than a month ago, returned to the witness stand to testify about further DNA results on blood found at the murder scene, in Simpson's Ford Bronco and on a pair of socks in his bedroom.</P>



<P>Sims said RFLP tests had shown that DNA in blood on the rear gate at the murder scene was consistent with Simpson's DNA pattern. The same held for blood recovered from the Bronco and the socks.</P>



<P>Sims' testimony came after an employee of Bloomingdale's testified that he sold Simpson shoes but could not remember selling the type of shoe that left bloody prints at the crime scene.</P>



<P>Samuel Poser, shoe department manager at the Bloomingdale's store in New York, said Simpson had purchased shoes there on four or five occasions but he did not recall Simpson buying a pair of Bruno Magli designer shoes manufactured in Italy.</P>



<P>An FBI expert previously testified that the bloody shoe prints leading away from the murder scene outside were made by size 12 Bruno Magli shoes. Simpson wears a size 12 but prosecutors have been unable to prove that he ever owned a pair of Bruno Maglis.</P>



<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>

<P><B>JUNE 21</B> - O.J. Simpson tried on another pair of Aris Isotoner gloves and this time they fit.</P>



<P>The gloves were brand new and the same make, model and size as the bloody gloves found at the crime scene -- the ones that did not appear to fit Simpson last week when he tried them on over latex gloves. Prosecutor Christopher Darden asked Simpson to try on the new gloves in perhaps a last-ditch attempt to repair what was viewed as a near-fatal blunder to the state's case.</P>



<P>"I think they fit quite well, declared glove expert witness Richard Rubin. "They appear to fit him snug and tight, pretty much the way the gloves were designed."</P>



<P>But during cross-examination, Rubin conceded that he could not say whether the gloves were cut by the same person who cut the bloody gloves, or whether they were a perfect extra large, a snug extra large or an oversized extra large.</P>



<P>Defense attorney Johnnie Cochran Jr. also got Rubin to testify that the left glove, found at Bundy, seemed to have less blood staining than the right glove, found at Rockingham. The right glove seemed to be smaller -- presumably due to shrinkage -- than the left glove. Prosecutors have previously said that the left glove was so soaked in blood that they could not perform DNA testing on it -- a contradiction that has not been explained.</P>



<P>Prosecutors also called witnesses to discuss records of phone calls that Simpson made from the cellular phone on June 12, 1994 and the whereabouts of his girlfriend Paula Barbieri.</P>



<P>Testimony showed Simpson called Nicole Brown Simpson at 2:18 on the afternoon of June 12. The call lasted about three minutes. Then at 2:22 he made two calls to Barbieri's Florida number. Both calls were never completed, meaning Simpson got a busy signal or no answer. At 2:23 he called Barbieri's Los Angeles number. The call lasted about 90 seconds. At 2:24 he tried her again in Florida but got no answer or a busy signal.</P>



<P>Records from the Mirage Hotel in Las Vegas showed that 19 minutes before Simpson made the first call to Barbieri's number in Florida, she was checking into a suite at the hotel as a guest of singer Michael Bolton. (Bolton was performing in Las Vegas and hosting a celebrity softball game.)</P>



<P>Prosecutors have tried to show that Simpson is an obsessive man and was spurned by the two women on the day of the murders. Cochran told jurors during opening statements that they would hear about Simpson's wonderful relationship with Barbieri and that he couldn't have been obsessed with his former wife. But, the fact that Barbieri was in Las Vegas with Bolton provides prosecutors with evidence to present another theory.</P>



<P>Finally, at 10:03pm, Simpson made two more calls to Barbieri -- one to the Florida number and one to the Los Angeles number. This was about the time that prosecutors say the murders took place and the time Simpson said he was at home, either chipping golf balls or sleeping. The prosecution probably will argue that if Simpson was home, he would not be making calls on his cellular phone.</P>



<P>In a separate hearing, a Missouri judge ruled Marcus Allen does not to have to go to Los Angeles to testify for the defense about his alleged affair with Nicole Brown Simpson. Judge Thomas Clark ruled without prejudice there was insufficient information about what Allen would say on the witness stand to compel him to compel him to testify.</P>



<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>

<P><B>JUNE 22</B> - The day featured arguments over which numbers should be used to explain frequencies in mixed samples of DNA.</P>



<P>In the end, Judge Lance Ito sided with prosecutors, allowing them to present their method of calculating frequencies from the mixed samples. And, once again, jurors heard astronomical numbers -- this time in the range of billions to trillions.</P>



<P>For example, witness Bruce Weir testified that there is a one in six million to one in 600 billion chance that the mixture of blood on the glove found on O.J. Simpson's estate belongs to people other than Simpson and Ronald Goldman.</P>



<P>Meanwhile, prosecutors accused Simpson of not taking his arthritis medicine so his hands would swell, making it appear that extra-large gloves would not fit him. The allegation was contained in transcripts of Wednesday's sidebar conferences. At one point, prosecutor Christopher Darden said to Judge Ito: "Another concern of ours is that Mr. Simpson has arthritis and we looked at the medication that  he takes and some of it is anti-inflammatory and we are told that he has not taken the stuff for a day and it caused swelling in the joints and inflammation in his hands and I'm concerned about that."</P>



<P>Defense attorney Johnnie Cochran Jr., scoffed at the accusation. "My dear friends are being paranoid, your honor," he said. "The man has medicine. He doesn't want to be sick."</P>



<P>Prosecutors also said they have photographs of Simpson wearing gloves, perhaps the Aris-Isotoner type gloves found at the crime scenes. Additionally, they subpoenaed NBC for videotapes of Simpson wearing leather gloves during football game telecasts in 1993 and 1994.</P>



<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>

<P><B>JUNE 23</B> - Population geneticist Bruce Weir conceded that he overestimated the chances of a match between O.J. Simpson's DNA and DNA found at his home and the crime scenes.</P>



<P>"I am sincerely sorry and embarrassed," Weir said during questioning by defense attorney Peter Neufeld. "When I do calculations, I do not consider any forensic implications. And if you are suggesting that I do , let me disabuse you of that right now."</P>



<P>Weir said the errors did not compromise the overall findings that link Simpson's DNA to the blood but the defense contended that he was biased against Simpson. The mistakes affected some but not all of the frequency numbers given by Weir. And they did not affect any of the frequency numbers offered by witnesses Robin Cotton of Cellmark Diagnostics and Gary Sims of the California Department of Justice.</P>



<P>Cotton and Sims' DNA results calculated the chance that blood could come from someone other than Simpson's or the victims. Weir's numbers were less specific. His numbers calculated the frequency of a stain if the blood was contributed by random people. For example, he concluded that the genetic markers found in the blood stain on Ronald Goldman's boot, if left by two people, could be found in 1 in 300 million to 1 in 1 trillion people.</P>



<P>But by failing to include a genetic marker possibly contained in Simpson's blood, Weir said he overstated the likelihood that the defendant's blood was contained in blood mixtures found in his Bronco and on a glove found behind his home.</P>



<P>For every additional DNA type factored into Weir's calculations, the chances for a random match in the general population becomes more frequent. Weir failed to include one additional DNA type when considering some evidence that included Simpson's DNA profile in the blood mixture.</P>



<P>The errors involved what Neufeld called "examiner bias." In other words, he claimed Weir manipulated his calculations to buttress the prosecution's findings.</P>



<P>Meanwhile, Judge Lance Ito agreed to release transcripts from the in-chambers discussions that led to the dismissal of 10 jurors. The judge said he would release the information on July 3, editing out sensitive items that could identify jurors.</P>



<P>The ACLU and the defense sought release of the documents. The ACLU presented First Amendment arguments for why the information should be released, and the defense argued that Simpson's Sixth Amendment rights to a fair trial also compelled the release of the information. Defense attorney Alan Dershowitz argued that by making the reasons for the dismissals public, the public would learn what occurred. He also said that others with knowledge about the jurors might come forward with information that could help the defense with its claim that the prosecution has targeted pro-Simpson jurors for dismissal.</P>



<P>In other rulings:</P>



<UL TYPE=DISC>

	<LI>Judge Ito said the defense must turn over all reports prepared by expert witnesses who will testify. He also told the defense, as he had in the past, that he will bar an expert's testimony if he finds that the defense intentionally told an expert not to write a report so that there would not be anything to turn over to the prosecution.<P>



	<LI>The judge did not quash defense subpoenas for three members of the prosecution team, including Assistant District Attorneys Alan Yochelson and Terry White. The defense wants to question them -- out of court and perhaps later call them as witnesses -- about what was said during the mock cross examination of detective Mark Fuhrman.

<H2>Week by Week in the O.J. Simpson Criminal Trial</H2>



<H3>Week 23 (June 26 - 30, 1995)</H3>



<P><B>JUNE 26</B> - Defense attorney Peter Neufeld took a broad swipe at the prosecution's DNA evidence, trying to cast doubt on all the frequency numbers meant to implicate O.J. Simpson.</P>



<P>His questions to genetic statistician Bruce Weir repeatedly focused on the databases used by Cellmark Diagnostics and the California Department of Justice lab, with Neufeld suggesting that the samples were not large enough to include a representative sample.</P>



<P>Weir agreed that the perfect database would include everyone in the world but he said that would be impossible to do. A representative sample is the next best thing, he said, but Neufeld suggested that that was not what prosecutors had used in the case.</P>



<P>Neufeld labeled the data bases "convenient samples," not random samples, and made the point that at least one Cellmark database did not include Asians and a portion of the FBI database did not include blacks.</P>



<P>But Weir testified that Neufeld's emphasis on the racial make-up of the sample group was misguided. He said the databases used were perfectly acceptable and that the numbers based on it were accurate.</P>



<P>Weir, however, was forced to admit that his calculations of genetic frequencies in mixed blood stains were "consistently wrong" because of his computer programming error.</P>



<P>"It was worse than I realized," he said.</P>



<P>Weir went through the frequency numbers with Neufeld, giving his corrected figures. Weir admitted that revised figures increased the chances that blood could have come from other people, but the figures still supported the prosecution's theory of the case.</P>



<P>Regarding the four blood drops from the Bronco console and one from the glove found at Simpson's estate, Weir admitted the corrected figures indicated the blood could have come from at least twice as many people. For example, three stains on the console that prosecutors say is a mixture of Simpson's and the two victims, were originally calculated by Weir to indicate a chance of 1 in 1,400 that any two people could be responsible for the stains. The corrected figure was 1 in every 570 people.</P>



<P>Weir's testimony involved stains that contained a mixture of blood from at least two people. His mistakes, however, all involved stains that DNA experts had already said probably included Simpson's blood. As a result, the defense contended Weir's errors were biased because they made it appear very unlikely that someone other than Simpson could have contributed to a stain.</P>



<P>Under redirect questioning by prosecutor George Clarke, Weir insisted he did not give special weight to the fact that some of the blood stains had been linked to Simpson and the victims.</P>



<P>Weir's testimony was followed by the start of hair and trace evidence. Prosecutor Marcia Clark asked a police laboratory technician to tell exactly how each piece of evidence was opened, examined, packaged and, in some cases, placed in an evidence freezer.</P>



<P>Witness Denise Lewis said she processed hairs, fibers from Simpson's Bronco and clothing from both victims, but didn't handle bloody gloves and a ski cap collected in the case.</P>



<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>

<P><B>JUNE 27</B> - The prosecution began presenting the final pieces of physical evidence intended to link O.J. Simpson to the two murder victims and the Akita dog whose howls may have signaled the bloody killings.</P>



<P>Susan Brockbank, a police department criminalist in the trace analysis laboratory, testified that in June 1994, she collected hair and trace evidence from the bloody glove found at the Bundy crime scene, from the victims' clothing and from the blue knit cap found at the crime scene. She also took hair and other evidence from the brown plaid cap, the towel, the piece of plastic and the shovel, all found in O.J. Simpson's Ford Bronco. </P>



<P>In July 1994, after analyzing the hair and trace evidence, Brockbank collected 93 hairs from Simpson's head.</P>



<P>Prosecutors contend the cap belonged to Simpson and that he dropped it as he fled Nicole Brown Simpson's condominium. One of the gloves was found at his estate, the other at the murder scene.</P>



<P>The prosecution plans to call an FBI expert to link the hairs to Simpson, his former wife and Nicole Brown Simpson's dog, Kato.</P>



<P>The questioning of Brockbank followed a now typical prosecution pattern. Prosecutor Marcia Clark, trying to preempt defense claims about sloppy police procedures, asked Brockbank to detail the precautions she took in handling the evidence. In often tedious testimony, Brockbank described how Latex gloves, laboratory coats, packing tape, butcher paper, boxes, bleach and the folders to store evidence, known as bindles, were repeatedly changed to avoid contamination.</P>



<P>Clark also asked about possible mistakes.</P>



<P>For example, FBI analyst Doug Deedrick found more hairs on the gloves and knit cap than Brockbank initially reported. The witness suggested that this was because she had mounted the hairs with roots on the microscope with water, which, she explained, is not the best way to mount evidence onto a microscope. She said hersupervisor, Gregory Matheson, told her to use a water mount to avoid risk of degrading possible DNA samples in the hair.</P>



<P>The jury also heard the conclusion of testimony from another police criminalist. Denise Lewis. She testified about her role in receiving items of evidence, such as Nicole Brown Simpson's dress and underwear.</P>



<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>

<P><B>JUNE 28</B> - The court day came to an abrupt halt after defense attorneys complained that prosecutors did not turn over demonstration boards crucial to the state's case.</P>



<P>The defense was particularly upset about a board depicting a virtual trail of fibers from Ronald Goldman to O.J. Simpson. Prosecutors say the blue-black cotton fibers found on Goldman's shirt match those on the glove found at Rockingham and on the socks found in Simpson's home. The board displays photographs of the fibers. Additionally, Judge Lance Ito said prosecutors have a photograph of Simpson wearing blue or black clothing on the night of the murders.</P>



<P>Defense attorneys asked the judge to prevent the state from using the board, saying they had not seen it before Wednesday. Prosecutor Marcia Clark argued the board and the photographs it shows are not evidence. The evidence, she said, consists of the results of the fiber analysis and FBI agent Doug Deedrick's report detailing those results. The defense has that information, Clark said.</P>



<P>In the end, Judge Ito recessed court early to allow defense attorneys to review the photo board. He will ask the lawyers Thursday if they have had enough time to construct a response to the board. If they haven't, he said he will impose other sanctions, possibly barring prosecutors from using the board.</P>



<P>The defense also objected to three other boards, but Judge Ito overruled the objections. One of the boards shows photographs comparing dog hairs. The prosecution contends that hairs matching Nicole Brown Simpson's white Akita were on the gloves found at the Bundy and Rockingham crime scenes. Prosecutors also say that hairs matching Simpson's black Akita were found at the crime scene and on the Bundy glove. </P>



<P>Defense attorney F. Lee Bailey noted that hairs matching the white Akita are not significant because the dog could have been at Simpson's home at any time. Bailey also argued that prosecutors failed to mention that black dog hairs similar to those from Simpson's Akita were found at Goldman's apartment. He said that information should have been included in the chart, but Judge Ito ruled that Bailey could raise these points during cross-examination.</P>



<P>Another chart shows that fibers similar to the carpet from Simpson's Ford Bronco are consistent with fibers on the glove found at Rockingham and the knit cap found at Bundy. The chart also includes information from the Ford Motor Company, which indicates that Bronco carpets are not all made of the same fiber.</P>



<P>Meanwhile, prosecutors have even more hair and fiber evidence linking Simpson to the murders. It includes fibers from Nicole Brown Simpson's dress found on Goldman's shirt. Prosecutors are expected to argue that Nicole Brown Simpson was killed first and that the assailant then turned to Goldman, leaving her dress fibers on his shirt.</P>



<P>The day's testimony came from police criminalist Susan Brockbank, who testified about the debris she and the FBI's Deedrick removed form Goldman's blood-soaked shirt. Deedrick is expected to testify that this debris included the blue-black fibers.</P>



<P>During cross-examination, defense attorney Robert Blasier first established that hair and trace evidence is not as scientific as fingerprint or DNA evidence. He then asked about possible contamination, focusing on whether the police detectives investigating the murders could have transferred trace evidence by going from Nicole Brown Simpson's house to Simpson's house and then back to the Bundy crime scene.</P>



<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>

<P><B>JUNE 29</B> - It was a bad day for the prosecution, but it could have been worse.</P>



<P>Judge Lance Ito ruled prosecutors could not offer a report that closely links carpet fibers on murder scene evidence to O.J. Simpson's Bronco. But he rejected a defense request for the most severe of sanctions -- barring FBI Special Agent Doug Deedrick from testifying.</P>



<P>The ruling followed emotional arguments over the report, which details the rarity of carpet fibers found on one of the leather gloves and the knit cap.</P>



<P>Defense attorney Johnnie Cochran Jr. referred to the state's failure to turn over the report as "the most egregious violation of all" in the case.</P>



<P>The prosecution had provided the defense a conclusive report prepared by Deedrick. However, a more extensive writing in Deedrick's possession was discovered by the defense. In the report, entitled, "The Search for the Source," Deedrick wrote that only Ford Broncos made in 1993 and 1994 had the kind of carpet tied to the killings of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman.</P>



<P>Prosecutor Marcia Clark stressed that she only learned of the report Wednesday night, stating that this was not a willful violation of the discovery rules. She pleaded with the court to sanction her directly and not the people of California or the families of the victims.</P>



<P>Clark's legal argument was that the law required only the turning over of conclusions reached by expert witnesses not notes which lead a witness to those conclusions.</P>



<P>"They've been denied nothing," she said, her voice rising. "There has never been a defendant in the history of this state ... that has had everybody bend over backwards for him the way this one has."</P>



<P>An infuriated Cochran countered that no defendant had ever had so many government agencies and law officials massed against him. The lawyer said the defense followed the same investigative path as the FBI but was denied data by the carpet manufacturer and in fact was given "disinformation" by the company, which said the carpet was common.</P>



<P>"We're fighting the power of the government," Cochran said, waving his arms and at times pointing his finger into the lectern. "When the FBI calls, it's a different matter."</P>



<P>The judge finally ruled Deedrick could testify but could not offer any testimony about the rarity of the fibers,their color, formation or date of production, which was included in the report. As a result, the prosecution only will be able to elicit testimony as to Deedrick's opinions, which are based on microscopic analysis.</P>



<P>During his testimony, Deedrick described his education and experience. A 23-year veteran of the FBI, he has conducted approximately 500,000 comparisons of hair and fiber evidence in nearly 4,000 cases.</P>



<P>Meanwhile, prosecutors confirmed that their final witness will be Nicole Brown Simpson's mother, Judith Brown.</P>



<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>

<P><B>JUNE 30</B> - An FBI evidence expert testified that hairs similar to Nicole Brown Simpson's hair were found on a pair of bloody gloves the prosecution claims O.J. Simpson wore when he allegedly killed his ex-wife and Ronald Goldman.</P>



<P>The expert, Doug Deedrick, also said hairs similar to Goldman's were found on the right hand glove, discovered at Simpson's home several hours after the murders. In addition, Deedrick said, hairs similar to Simpson's head hairs were found on Goldman's shirt, and limb hair -- coming from the limbs rather than head -- was found on Goldman's shirt and in the Rockingham glove.</P>



<P>Head hairs similar to Simpson's and his ex-wife's also were found on the knit watch cap recovered from the murder scene.</P>



<P>Deedrick was ordered by Judge Lance Ito not to use the word "match" when describing the similarity between the hairs after the expert had explained that hair and fiber analysis was an inexact science. Instead, he testified that the evidence hair had the same microscopic characteristics as known hair samples from the victims.</P>

<H2>Week by Week in the O.J. Simpson Criminal Trial</H2>



<H3>Week 24 (July 5 - 7, 1995)</H3>



<P><B>JULY 5</B> - FBI expert Doug Deedrick completed his direct examination by focusing on the clothing and carpet fibers that the prosecution contends link O.J. Simpson to the murders.</P>



<P>Deedrick testified that rose-beige fibers stuck to a ski cap near the bodies and on a bloody glove behind Simpson's house were similar to the unique carpet fibers in Simpson's white Ford Bronco. He said the rare fibers also were found on a towel, plastic bag and shovel taken from inside Simpson's Bronco.</P>



<P>Deedrick also said he found fibers similar to ones from Nicole Brown Simpson's dress on Ronald Goldman's shirt. Prosecutor Marcia Clark used this conclusion to assert the state's theory that Simpson first attacked his former wife with a glove touching the dress. He then attacked Goldman with the same glove touching Goldman. The dress fibers could have been transferred by the bloody glove, Deedrick said.</P>



<P>Deedrick used charts and pictures of the victims' bloody clothes to explain the fabric evidence to jurors. He concluded that:</P>



<UL TYPE=DISC>

<LI>Fibers consistent with those from the blue knit cap found at Bundy were on Goldman's shirt. No hat fibers were found on Nicole Brown Simpson's dress.<P>



<LI>Goat hairs similar to the cashmere lining of the gloves -- which another witness said were the same size and model as a pair that Nicole Brown Simpson bought in New York -- were found on Goldman's shirt and on the Bundy hat. This testimony was consistent with a glove coming off during the struggle, Deedrick said.<P>



<LI>Cotton fibers of a blue-black color were found on the Rockingham glove, Goldman's shirt and on the socks from Simpson's bedroom. The state believes Simpson was wearing a blue-black colored sweatshirt on the night of the murders.

</UL>



<P>Defense attorney F. Lee Bailey elicited from Deedrick testimony that the agent never obtained samples of clothing from law enforcement personnel at the crime scene and didn't check to see if the fibers matched the dark blue uniforms of police officers.</P>



<P>He also got Deedrick to acknowledge that hair and fiber analysis is a less exact science than comparisons involving fingerprints, footprints and ballistics.</P>



<P>Bailey also tried to show that Deedrick is a poorly qualified expert because he has written only a few articles about forensic science and is not a member of any professional societies, such as the American Academy of Forensic Science. Bailey could be setting the jury up for a comparison between Deedrick and defense expert Henry Lee, considered one of the most prominent forensic scientists in the country.</P>



<P>Meanwhile, it's been reported that the first defense witnesses will include Simpson family members and golf buddies who will talk about Simpson's demeanor before and after the murders.</P>



<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>

<P><B>JULY 6</B> - After presenting 58 witnesses and 488 exhibits, the state rested its case -- but not before offering jurors one final reminder of the brutal murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman.</P>



<P>Immediately before resting the state's case, prosecutor Marcia Clark read three stipulations, including one declaring the last time Nicole Brown Simpson spoke to her mother: 9:40pm on June 12, 1994. In a statement, Juditha Brown said that she called her daughter at home and the two talked for a few minutes about the glasses Brown had left at the Mezzaluna restaurant.</P>



<P>Prosecutors originally planned to called Brown to the witness stand, but they agreed with defense attorneys at the last minute to stipulate to her testimony.</P>



<P>Absent from the stipulation regarding Brown was a claim made by prosecutor Christopher Darden in his opening statement. Darden had promised jurors that Brown would testify that O.J. Simpson exhibited obsessive behavior towards his former wife.</P>



<P>But prosecutors apparently did not want Brown subjected to cross-examination. The cross-examination could have included questions about statements she made during a nationwide speaking tour or statements she made about Simpson and her daughter before she believed him responsible for the murders.</P>



<P>The second stipulation involved phone records of Brown and Simpson. The phone records corroborate the time Brown called Mezzaluna to see if her glasses were still there; the time of her phone call to her daughter; and the time of police detective calls to Simpson in Chicago.</P>



<P>The final stipulation brought jurors back to the crime scene. The jurors saw for the first time one particularly gruesome close-up photograph of Ronald Goldman's slashed neck. They also saw a photograph of Nicole Brown Simpson laying in a pool of blood.</P>



<P>Before the state rested, defense attorney F. Lee Bailey ended his cross-examination of FBI evidence expert Doug Deedrick, eliciting a litany of concessions that could be viewed as helpful to Simpson. They included the fact that no hair consistent with the victims was found in Simpson's Bronco; no hair consistent with Simpson's was found on the Bundy glove or the Rockingham glove, and no hair consistent with Goldman's or Nicole Brown Simpson's was found on the socks in Simpson's bedroom.</P>



<P>Bailey also raised the dandruff defense. He got Deedrick to concede that he found dandruff in the hairs taken from Simpson but none in the hairs found in the knit cap at the crime scene.</P>



<P>On re-direct, Clark tried to rehabilitate Deedrick's testimony on several points. She asked whether Simpson could have contracted dandruff in jail, accounting for the fact that dandruff was found in the hair sample taken after he was in jail for a month. She also asked questions to show that police department uniforms are made of pure wool -- a different color and fiber -- than the black-blue cotton fibers found on the victims, the Rockingham glove and Simpson's socks.</P>



<P>Deedrick also reiterated that Simpson has very distinctive hair and that the distinguishing characteristics of his hair were seen in the hairs found on the blue knit cap and on Goldman's shirt. Deedrick also insisted that his results stood independent of all the DNA blood evidence presented during the months preceding his testimony.</P>



<P>The state then rested, and Judge Lance Ito dismissed the jury until Monday when the defense will start its case.</P>



<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>

<P><B>JULY 7</B> - A day after the prosecution rested its case, Judge Lance Ito dealt with several important evidentiary matters.</P>



<P>During arguments over the formal introduction into evidence of crime scene photographs, the prosecution revealed that Nicole Brown Simpson may have armed herself with a butcher knife after hearing suspicious noises outside her condominium moments before the killings.</P>



<P>After the defense objected to the introduction of pictures showing the knife lying on a kitchen counter, prosecutor Marcia Clark argued that a fearful Nicole Brown Simpson possibly retrieved the knife and only placed it on the counter upon Ronald Goldman's arrival. Clark said the photos were relevant to show that other than the knife on the counter, the kitchen was clean.</P>



<P>Judge Ito ruled the photos relevant because they showed an orderly, clean kitchen. This, the judge said, went to the issue of whether there was any intruder or assault inside the house.</P>



<P>The judge also ruled that during deliberations the jurors could see the knives used for demonstration purposes during the state's case. He said they were useful because the exhibit boards displaying the knives were two-dimensional whereas the knives are three-dimensional.</P>



<P>And, to no one's surprise, the judge rejected a defense motion to dismiss the case.</P>

<H2>Week by Week in the O.J. Simpson Criminal Trial</H2>



<H3>Week 25 (July 10 - 14, 1995)</H3>



<P><B>JULY 10</B> - The defense began its case with testimony that O.J. Simpson was distraught and grief stricken about the death of his former wife.</P>



<P>A contingent of Simpson's family members appeared in the courtroom. His mother, sister, daughter and first wife, all dressed in yellow, sat together in the front row in a show of support .</P>



<P>The defense has said its case will be short and snappy. It was on Monday, with five witnesses testifying.</P>



<P>First to take the stand was Simpson's eldest daughter, 26-year-old Arnelle, who testified that her father was "emotional," "distraught" and "out of control" when he learned about Nicole Brown Simpson's death. She was followed by one of Simpson's sisters, Carmelita Simpson-Durio, who described her brother's demeanor after hearing about the murders: "What I would say is he was out of it," she said. "He was shocked, dazed."</P>



<P>Arnelle Simpson testified that after learning about the murders in the early morning of June 13, her father sounded overwrought and perplexed over the telephone. Whe he returned home from Chicago, he was in shock and disbelief, she said.</P>



<P>The testimony differed from prosecution witness Ronald Shipp, a former police officer and Simpson friend. He had testified that Simpson showed little remorse about his ex-wife's death and even told Shipp on June 13 that he sometimes dreamed about killing his former wife.</P>



<P>Defense attorney Johnnie Cochran, Jr. spent much of the day attacking Shipp. At one point he got Arnelle Simpson to recall she had once seen Shipp -- who is married -- in the Jacuzzi at Rockingham with a woman with "dirty blond" hair.</P>



<P>Cochran also repeatedly asked Arnelle Simpson where she had seen Shipp when friends and family gathered at the Rockingham estate on June 13. The witness said that as her grieving father sat on a couch holding his mother's hand, Shipp remained at the bar of the home's living room, drinking a beer; though Arnelle Simpson said she didn't see him drinking more than one, Cochran persisted and even asked if Shipp had been drunk.</P>



<P>During Arnelle Simpson's testimony, the jury also heard for the first time that Simpson and his former wife got back together in March 1993 and dated up until May 1994. She also testified that after the couple's final break-up several weeks before the murders, the two were on such good terms that Nicole Brown Simpson was sitting on Simpson's lap at a picnic and napping in his bed.</P>



<P>Arnelle Simpson also testified that she did not see any blood in the foyer or in the driveway of the Rockingham estate on the morning after the murders.</P>



<P>She also testified that she had never seen her father wear a bluish-black sweat suit. Brian Kaelin previously testified that Simpson was wearing such an outfit on the night of the killings, and prosecutors say that suit was the source of fibers on a glove found at Simpson's estate after the killings, on socks found at the foot of Simpson's bed and on Ronald Goldman's blood-soaked shirt.</P>



<P>During cross-examination, prosecutor Marcia Clark drove home the point that Arnelle Simpson could not account for her father's whereabouts at about 10 pm on the night of the murders.</P>



<P>Simpson's 73-year-old mother, Eunice, then took the witness stand. Aided by defense lawyer Carl Douglas and a sheriff's deputy, and using a cane, she hobbled to the stand and took the oath sitting down. She said that she needed the cane because she had rheumatoid arthritis, which she said ran in her family, with her son having it "most of all."</P>



<P>"Oh he seemed very upset," she said of her son's demeanor after the killings. "Shocked."</P>



<P>Both Eunice Simpson and Carmelita Durio testified that they saw Shipp at the bar of Simpson's home after the murders. Eunice Simpson testified that Shipp appeared "spaced," while Durio said she believed that Shipp "was high" and that he had never been alone with Simpson that evening.</P>



<P>Under cross-examination, Durio said she did not know whether Shipp's demeanor was the result of his crying over Nicole Simpson's death.</P>



<P>The family members were followed by two longtime acquaintances of Simpson. Carol Conner, a philanthropist and songwriter, discussed Simpson's mood at a fund-raiser the night before the murders. Mary Collins, Simpson's interior designer for 20 years, discussed meeting with him on June 6, 1994, to talk about redecorating his home.</P>



<P>On Monday, the defense also tried to introduce a letter Nicole Brown Simpson wrote Simpson in March 1993. In the letter, she pleaded with him to reconcile their marriage and asked him to let her back in his life. The defense wanted to introduce the letter to contradict prosecution claims that Simpson was obsessed with his former wife and would do anything to get her back. But Judge Lance Ito ruled the letter was not relevant.</P>



<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>

<P><B>JULY 11</B> - The defense began chipping away at the prosecution's timeline. Several witnesses testified that they did not hear anything unusual near the murder scene at the time the state claims the killings took place.</P>



<P>The witnesses included Dan Mandel and Ellen Aaronson, who were on their first date. They each testified that they walked past Nicole Brown Simpson's home at about 10:30 pm on June 12. The area appeared normal, and they did not hear any dog barking, they said.</P>



<P>But the most dramatic testimony of the day came from one of Nicole Brown Simpson's neighbors. Robert Heidstra testified that around 10:40 pm, while he was standing near her condominium, he heard two men arguing.</P>



<P>One yelled "Hey! Hey! Hey!" Heidstra said. The other male voiced shouted back, but Heidstra said he could not make out what the other voice was saying because Nicole Brown Simpson's Akita dog was barking hysterically. "Then I heard a gate slam, bang!" he said.</P>



<P>The prosecution has placed the time of the murders at about 10:15 pm, giving Simpson time to commit the murders and return home to catch a limousine ride to the airport. The defense wants to push the murders as close to 11pm when Simpson has an alibi.</P>



<P>Even if the murders occurred at 10:40 pm, Simpson still had time to make it home by 11pm because his home is just a five-minutes away if driving at the speed limit, according to earlier police testimony.</P>



<P>Tuesday's testimony does raise questions about the source of the three thumps that Brian Kaelin said he heard outside his guest room at the Rockingham estate. Kaelin said he heard the noise at about 10:40 pm.</P>



<P>Another witness, Francesca Harmon, said she drove by Nicole Simpson's apartment at around 10:30 p.m. on the night of the murders and saw nothing unusual. She also did not hear a dog barking in the neighborhood at that time.</P>



<P>Tuesday's first defense witness was Simpson's older sister Shirley Simpson-Baker, who said that when she arrived at his mansion the day after the murders her brother was "'devastated. He was crying, he was sad, he was in disbelief, he was in shock,"' she said.</P>



<P>Simpson-Baker was followed on the stand by Jack McKay, a psychological association executive who played golf with Simpson in Virginia on June 8. McKay described Simpson as "very cordial, friendly, very willing to shake hands, sign autographs, have pictures taken.</P>



<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>

<P><B>JULY 12</B> - A defense witness testified that he saw a white vehicle similar to O.J. Simpson's leaving the crime scene the night Nicole Simpson and Ronald Goldman were slain.</P>



<P>Robert Heidstra, Nicole Simpson's neighbor, made the disclosure as prosecutors aggressively questioned him and tried to attack his credibility.</P>



<P>Prosecutor Christopher Darden also pressed Heidstra on a statement he allegedly made to a friend that  Simpson's voice may have been one of two he heard as he walked his dogs near the crime scene on June 12, 1994.</P>



<P>The question triggered an angry exchange between Darden and defense lawyer Johnnie Cochran. After Judge Lance Ito sent the jury out, Darden said he asked the question in good faith. He said Heidstra told a friend, Patricia Barrett, that he could identify one of the men as a young white man and the other as an older black man.</P>



<P>"You can't tell by someone's voice when they're black," Cochran said. "That's racist. This statement about whether somebody sounds black or white is racist, and I resent it. I think it's totally improper in America at this time in 1995 just to hear this and endure this."</P>



<P>Darden explained to Ito that the statement was allegedly made by the witness, not him.</P>



<P>"If the statement is racist, then he is the racist, not me, OK?," Darden said, looking at Cochran.</P>



<P>"I didn't say you," Cochran answered.</P>



<P>"That's what you're suggesting," Darden said. "That's created a lot of problems for my family and myself, statements with race..."</P>



<P>Ito, disgusted with the exchange, announced "I'm so mad at both of you guys, I'm about to hold you both in contempt."</P>



<P>"I apologize, your honor," Darden said.</P>



<P>"It'll take more than that," Ito said, stepping off the bench and calling a recess.</P>



<P>When Heidstra returned to the witness stand, he denied telling anyone about the identity of the voices.</P>



<P>Heidstra's testimony Wednesday's appeared to help both sides.</P>



<P>In his direct examination, Heidstra said he saw the white vehicle, -- possibly a Blazer or a Jeep Cherokee -- pull up to the corner of Bundy Drive and Dorothy Street about 10:45 pm. He also said the vehicle was headed south rather than north towards Simpson's home.</P>



<P>But under cross-examination, Heidstra conceded that the vehicle could have been a Ford Bronco.</P>



<P>Although waffling on the identity of the vehicle, Heidstra never wavered from his time estimates, which conflict with the prosecution's time line for the murders.</P>



<P>Other witnesses have accounted for Simpson's whereabouts at about 9:45 pm and just minutes before 11 pm. Prosecutors contend the murders occurred about 10:15 or 10:20 pm, about the time neighbors heard dogs barking loudly.</P>



<P>By the end of his cross-examination, Darden appeared intent on shrinking the time line to fit Heidstra's account.</P>



<P>The prosecutor suggested that even if Heidstra were right about the time, Simpson could have committed the murders, raced home two miles away, cleaned up and met a waiting limousine to go to the airport.</P>



<P>The next three witnesses also gave testimony that helped both sides.</P>



<P>Wayne Stanfield, the American Airlines captain who piloted Simpson's flight from Los Angeles to Chicago, testified that he did not see any cuts on Simpson's hands. Under cross-examination, Stanfield admitted that he wasn't looking for any cuts when he met Simpson.</P>



<P>Michael Norris and Michael Gladden, airport employees who both spoke with Simpson at the airport, also said they did not notice any cuts or injuries to his hands. The prosecution used the witnesses to attack the defense position that Simpson was too crippled by arthritis to commit the murders. Both men said Simpson was carrying his luggage and showed no pain when he bent down to pick them up.</P>



<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>

<P><B>JULY 13</B> - The defense suffered a major setback when Judge Lance Ito ruled it could not suggest the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman were drug-related.</P>



<P>The judge barred testimony from Faye Resnick's former boyfriend, Christian Reichardt, regarding Resnick's alleged drug habit. Although the judge ruled Reichardt could testify about Simpson's demeanor during the week before the murders, he sided with prosecutors on the drug-related killing issue, ruling there wasn't any evidence linking another person to the murders or evidence of motive for another person to commit the crimes.</P>



<P>The defense then decided not to call Reichardt as a witness -- at least for now. The defense had wanted him to testify that Resnick was a cocaine addict and possibly the intended murder victim.</P>



<P>In his ruling, Judge Ito cited California Supreme Court rulings which repeatedly held that mere motive or opportunity of a third party to commit a crime is insufficient to raise a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed the crime. Therefore, evidence of such motive is irrelevant and inadmissable. The rulings have held that there must be evidence linking the third party to the killings.</P>



<P>The decision curtailed a crucial defense theory that attorney Johnnie Cochran, Jr. raised in his opening statement, which has been alluded to during the trial. For example, there has been testimony about Columbian neckties -- a typical drug-related killing in which the killer slices the victim's throat.</P>



<P>Meanwhile, testimony focused on Simpson's behavior on the night of June 12, 1994 and the following day.</P>



<P>A succession of witnesses testified that Simpson was cordial and relaxed on the flight from Los Angeles to Chicago and did not have a cut on his left hand.</P>



<P>The fact is Simpson told police he cut his finger in Los Angeles. The defense may be attempting to force prosecutors to introduce the statement Simpson gave to police. The prosecution has not yet introduced the statement, because most of it is consistent with the defense assertions that at the time of the murders Simpson was running around trying to get ready for his trip. The only inconsistent statements are that he cut his finger in Los Angeles and that Simpson said he never hit his former wife.</P>



<P>On the flight home from Chicago, witnesses who either took Simpson to the airport or accompanied him back to Los Angeles, described him as frantic, looking skyward, sighing and moaning frequently. His left finger was either wrapped in a bloody Band-Aid or wrapped in a paper towel, they said.</P>



<P>Cochran asked Mark Partridge, a copyright lawyer from Chicago who was on the plane to Los Angeles, whether Simpson appeared to be acting. "I thought the way he was behaving was very sincere," replied Partridge, to whom Simpson had confided the news about the murders. Even so, Partridge said, Simpson complied when asked for an autograph.</P>



<P>"I thought, 'What a nice man this was to be doing this, having heard about the tragedy that had struck his life,' " testified Partridge, who has copyrighted each of the eight pages of the statement he prepared two days after the flight.</P>



<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>

<P><B>JULY 14</B> - The defense moved into a new phase of its case by presenting medical evidence that O.J. Simpson was physically incapable of committing the murders.</P>



<P>Dr. Robert Huizenga told the jury that although Simpson had "the body of Tarzan," he "walked like Tarzan's grandfather."</P>



<P>A Beverly Hills private intern, Huizenga examined Simpson on June 15, 1994, three days after the murders and then again two days later. He said Simpson was suffering from osteo and rheumatoid arthritis, which most likely prevented him from running or doing any other aerobic activity.</P>



<P>Huizenga also testified that three fresh cuts on the ring and middle fingers of Simpson's left hand probably were caused by glass, rather than a knife, as suggested by the prosecution. The doctor said the cuts were three-quarters of an inch to one-quarter of an inch long. "I think for the constellation of all the wounds, it seemed more likely that glass was the cause," he said.</P>



<P>He testified he also carefully looked for cuts, scratches and bruises on Simpson's body that may have indicated he had a struggle with someone. He said he found no evidence of such wounds.</P>



<P>Huizenga, a former team physician for the Los Angeles Raiders from 1983 to 1990, said Simpson had constant pain from surgery on his left wrist following a football injury in 1965. He had received multiple finger fractures, "which is pretty common in football," said Huizenga. Simpson also had developed large knuckles typical of osteoarthritis, and he suffered from osteoarthritis in his left knee.</P>



<P>But in a blow to the defense, Huizenga conceded under cross-examination that despite Simpson's arthritic condition, he was strong enough to kill two people with a single-edged knife.</P>



<P>Meanwhile, a judge in Florida ordered Keith Zlomsowitch, a boyfriend of Nicole Brown Simpson, to travel to California for the defense. They want Zlomsowitch to help defuse prosecution claims that Simpson is a jealous man. Zlomsowitch testified before the grand jury that Simpson witnessed him and Nicole Simpson having sex on a couch at her home.</P>

<BR CLEAR=ALL>



<H2>Week by Week in the O.J. Simpson Criminal Trial</H2>



<H3>Week 26 (July 17 - 21, 1995)</H3>



<P><B>JULY 17</B> - Although he suffered from arthritis and old football injuries, O.J. Simpson would have been physically capable of killing his former wife and a friend, a doctor testified.</P>



<P>Dr. Robert Huizenga said that in a "stationary situation" Simpson was fit enough to murder Nicole Brown Simpson in the manner suggested by the prosecution, namely by grabbing her head with his left hand and yanking it backwards before cutting her throat.</P>



<P>Next, Huizenga testified that a person's observation of Simpson not having a limp around the time of the killings was inconsistent with his findings on June 15, 1994. The suggestion was that Simpson may have faked the limp during the doctor's examination.</P>



<P>Prosecutor Brian Kelberg attempted to show that adrenaline may have accounted for Simpson's ability to commit the murders, notwithstanding his physical limitations. To further his point, Kelberg read into evidence a portion of a book written by Huizenga detailing a football team member's insistence on continuing to play despite a dislocated finger. Huizenga was a former team physician with the Los Angeles Raiders. In addition, Kelberg raised the familiar anecdote of a mother lifting a car to free her child from underneath it.</P>



<P>In the end, the doctor agreed that if Simpson committed the murders while in a rage, he would have been in "the throes of an adrenaline rush."</P>



<P>Kelberg later suggested that after the murders, Simpson could resume his normal personality, as would a football player who could shake an opponent's hand at the end of a tough game. Several defense witnesses said Simpson showed no signs of distress in the hours after the murders.</P>



<P>During the final half hour of the day, jurors watched portions of an exercise video featuring Simpson performing various exercises. The video was taped May 24 to May 27, 1994 -- two-and-a-half weeks before the murders.</P>



<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>

<P><B>JULY 18</B> - Jurors heard O.J. Simpson joke about domestic violence in a commercial exercise video he made several weeks before his ex-wife's murder.</P>



<P>During the video workout, filmed May 26, 1994, Simpson could be seen shadow boxing, throwing jabs and uppercuts. "Get your space in if you're exercising with your wife, if you know what I mean," he said, adding with a smile, "You can always blame it on working out."</P>



<P>Defense lawyer Robert Shapiro asked Judge Lance Ito to bar prosecutors from showing the clip, saying Simpson's comment "was clearly a remark made in jest and taken in jest."</P>



<P>But prosecutor Brian Kelberg argued that Simpson's "unscripted remark reflected his state of mind [and] his attitude toward his wife" several weeks before the murders.</P>



<P>Kelberg also played for jurors a second video of a promotional speech Simpson gave in March 1994. In the video, Simpson extolled the virtues of a vitamin supplement called Juice Plus, saying the product had so relieved his arthritis symptoms that he had quit taking conventional medication and pain relievers.</P>



<P>Both videos were intended to convince jurors that Simpson had the physical capability to commit the murders and was not suffering from acute arthritis at the time of the killings.</P>



<P>The defense also tried to show Tuesday that police "rushed to judgment" against Simpson when they handcuffed him almost immediately after he returned home from Chicago the day after the murders.</P>



<P>Police Officer Donald Thompson said Simpson was handcuffed on orders from Detective Philip Vannatter.</P>



<P>But the defense effort to show that Simpson was mistreated by police appeared to fail since Thompson said on cross-examination that Simpson's celebrity status earned him "special treatment."</P>



<P>Out of concern for "the dignity of the defendant," Thompson said, he led Simpson away from a swarm of television cameras before placing him in handcuffs, saying, "I didn't want to make a big scene there in the driveway." Thompson said Vannatter removed Simpson's handcuffs minutes later.</P>



<P>Thompson, a seven-year police veteran and training officer, said he had "never seen" a murder suspect treated with such deference.</P>



<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>

<P><B>JULY 19</B> - The defense continued to have problems with the credibility of its witnesses.</P>



<P>John Meraz, who towed Simpson's Bronco away from a police department shed several days after the murders, testified for the defense that he did not see any blood inside the vehicle or fingerprint powder on the doors.</P>



<P>But prosecutors presented photographs taken the day before Meraz moved the vehicle that clearly showed the blood and powder.</P>



<P>Meraz, who took two receipts from the Bronco, also admitted that he lied to the yard's manager about removal of the receipts. One of the receipts had Simpson's name on it; the other had Nicole Brown Simpson's name on it. Meraz said he showed the receipts to co-workers and later placed the vouchers into a side pocket of the Bronco. The receipts were never found and Meraz eventually was fired.</P>



<P>Deputy District Attorney Marcia Clark implied that the defense had helped Meraz in the wrongful termination suit he has filed against the tow yard. She also suggested that Meraz was testifying for the defense in exchange for immunity from prosecution for theft. Meraz admitted that defense lawyer Johnnie Cochran, Jr. told him the defense would not file charges against him.</P>



<P>Testifying after Meraz was Richard Walsh, the fitness instructor with whom Simpson produced an exercise video two weeks before the killings.</P>



<P>Walsh testified that he had reservations about Simpson's abilities to perform the video exercises. He noted that during rehearsals Simpson was unable to lift a 30-pound sandbag . And he said Simpson was given a chair and ice packs during breaks.</P>



<P>But on cross-examination, Walsh agreed that Simpon was able to perform all the exercises required for the video. Walsh testified that at one point he told Simpson, "it's too bad you're not tough enough to do this." Simpson then allegedly said, "let's go," and was able to resume exercising even after 12 hours of the workout.</P>



<P>The day's final witness was police photographer Willie Ford, who testified that he saw no socks when he videotaped Simpson's bedroom at 4:13 pm on June 13. A police evidence collector said he believed he had picked up the socks around 4:30 or 4:40 pm. The defense has claimed that the incriminating socks were planted in Simpson's bedroom.</P>



<P>In another defeat for the defense, Judge Lance Ito denied a request for a hearing on the issue of jury targeting. The judge ruled there was no evidence that the prosecution or any other law enforcement agency targeted jurors for dismissal.</P>



<P>The judge detailed the reasons for dismissing the four jurors in the dispute.</P>



<P>The first juror -- whose name has never been released -- was removed because he was a Hertz employee who lied during jury voir dire when he said that he had never met Simpson.</P>



<P>Juror Michael Knox failed to mention during voir dire that he had an arrest record for domestic violence.</P>



<P>Juror Jeannette Harris was removed for failing to disclose that she had filed a restraining order in 1988 against her husband.</P>



<P>Finally, the judge found that juror Willie Craven intimidated six different jurors.</P>



<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>

<P><B>JULY 20</B> - The defense pressed forward with the conspiracy phase of its case but ran into some severe roadblocks.</P>



<P>Judge Lance Ito restricted the testimony of one expert and raised the possibility of barring another expert.</P>



<P>The judge blocked much of the testimony of Herbert MacDonnell, a blood spatter expert from Corning, N.Y. MacDonnell conducted tests that the defense contends could prove blood was planted on socks seized from O.J. Simpson's bedroom the day after the murders.</P>



<P>The judge agreed with prosecutors that MacDonell's experiment, which determined the drying time of blood on sock fabric, was flawed because the materials and conditions affecting the socks in the case were not accurately recreated in the experiment.</P>



<P>Defense lawyers have said MacDonell's experiments suggested blood was placed on at least one of the socks when it was lying flat, not when it had a foot inside.</P>



<P>Meanwhile, another defense witness, blood expert Fredric Rieders, may not be allowed to testify as scheduled on Monday. Prosecutor Marcia Clark complained that the defense's late disclosure of Rieders' report didn't give her enough time for what she said would be a lengthy cross-examination.</P>



<P>Rieders is expected to say that a lab preservative called EDTA was found on the socks and on a back gate of Nicole Brown Simpson's condominium. That preservative is commonly added to blood stored at the police crime lab, and the defense argues its presence in evidence blood samples would prove that blood was planted.</P>



<P>On Thursday, the defense unsuccessfully tried to use two police witnesses to support the sock-planting theory.</P>



<P>Police photographer Willie Ford, whose video shot of Simpson's house the day after the murders shows no socks in the bedroom, explained that he only taped rooms after they were searched. Then Detective Bert Luper testified that he personally saw the socks collected by criminalist Dennis Fung -- before Ford even arrived at Simpson's house with the video camera.</P>



<P>Simpson's maid, Josephine "Gigi" Guarin testified that Simpson is very neat and orderly. He always put his clothes away, she said, adding that she never saw him throw clothes on the floor or around his room.</P>



<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>

<P><B>JULY 21</B> - Judge Lance Ito cancelled testimony is order to give prosecutors time to prepare for the next defense witness, a scientist whose report was only recently provided to the prosecution.</P>

<H2>Week by Week in the O.J. Simpson Criminal Trial</H2>



<H3>Week 27 (July 24 - 28, 1995)</H3>



<P><B>JULY 24</B> - The defense offered scientific evidence to support its claim that O.J. Simpson was a victim of a police conspiracy to frame him.</P>



<P>Fredric Rieders, a forensic toxicologist, testified that blood found on a sock in Simpson's bedroom and on a back gate of Nicole Brown Simpson's home appeared to contain the chemical preservative EDTA. The defense claims the presence of EDTA proves the blood on the sock came from a vial of Nicole Brown Simpson's autopsy blood and the gate blood came from a vial of blood Simpson gave to police the day after the murders.</P>



<P>Rieders testified that the EDTA on the sock was present only in the blood stain and nowhere else on the sock. This testimony negated a prosecution theory that laundry detergent accounted for the presence of the preservative.</P>



<P>Rieders, founder of National Medical Services laboratory in Willow Grove, Penn., based his conclusions on an examination of tests performed by the FBI.</P>



<P>Rieders testified that the FBI tests did not allow for a determination of the quantity of EDTA present in the stains. As a result, he said, it was not possible to make that determination, thus preventing the prosecution from showing that EDTA levels in the stains were lower than those found in the test tubes containing the blood samples.</P>



<P>Rieders also testified that even though EDTA is present in human blood, its presence is minimal. The quantity of EDTA in the two blood stains, he said, was much higher.</P>



<P>Judge Lance Ito had ruled Rieders could testify, despite prosecutors' arguments against it. Deputy District Attorney Brian Kelberg had asserted that Rieders' analysis could show only that the FBI tests were presumptive of the preservative, the same kind of test the judge previously ruled inadmissible at the request of the defense.</P>



<P>But the judge said prosecutors could question Rieders on mistakes he allegedly made in a past murder case.</P>



<P>Prosecutor Marcia Clark questioned Rieders about an alleged mistake in the case of a funeral home director accused in the death of a competitor. Rieders had concluded the victim could have died of oleander poisoning, but subsequent tests found no sign of oleander and charges against the defendant were dismissed.</P>



<P>Clark also tried to show that Rieders had misread a report by the Environmental Protection Agency, and that humans actually had much more EDTA in their blood than he said.</P>



<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>

<P><B>JULY 25</B> - An FBI scientist told jurors that he detected only vague signs of what could be a preservative on blood on a sock found at the foot of O.J. Simpson's bed and on a gate near the bodies of Simpson's ex-wife and her friend.</P>



<P>The testimony of Roger Martz contradicted Monday's defense witness, Fredric Rieders, a toxicologist who reviewed Martz's data and concluded that the preservative, EDTA, could have been present on the evidence.</P>



<P>Rieders didn't actually do any of his own testing. Instead, he relied on Martz's data. Since Martz had not testified for the prosecution, which didn't get into the preservative issue at all in its case, the defense was forced to call him as a witness.</P>



<P>During his questioning, defense lawyer Robert Blasier walked a fine line in trying to cast doubt on Martz's testing for EDTA without totally destroying the validity of the tests. Blasier's questioning on the credibility of the tests focused on Martz's lack of advanced education and experience, his possible motive in testing for limited results, and his lack of thoroughness.</P>



<P>Martz conceded that the evidence blood shared some of the physical properties and molecular characteristics of EDTA. He said the blood samples "responded like EDTA responded" and "was consistent with the presence of EDTA."</P>



<P>But Martz said Rieders had jumped to conclusions. "It is not appropriate to identify EDTA based on the data I have provided for the sock and the gate," he testified.</P>



<P>Martz insisted his tests not only failed to show that the evidence blood had anything close to the levels of EDTA in the test-tube blood, but that his data couldn't even support the theory that there was any EDTA at all in the evidence blood.</P>



<P>He said tests on his own, unpreserved blood showed the same kind of EDTA indicators present in the gate and sock blood, and that his data would suggest there was just as much EDTA in a clean piece of Nicole Brown Simpson's dress as in a blood stain elsewhere in the same dress.</P>



<P>The defense did win a victory Tuesday when Judge Lance Ito said it could present evidence of an experiment on glove shrinkage.</P>



<P>The judge ruled that defense expert Herbert MacDonell could discuss an experiment that found that leather gloves don't shrink very much when they get wet. These findings contradict the prosecution's contention that the evidence gloves didn't appear to fit Simpson during a courtroom demonstration because they shrank from being soaked in blood.</P>



<P>In another development, prosecutors sought to bar defense testimony about whether Detective Mark Fuhrman, who found the bloody glove at Simpson's estate, is a racist. They filed a motion saying the defense has "abysmally failed" to show Fuhrman planted evidence against Simpson.</P>



<P>Also, defense attorney Johnnie Cochran, Jr. is scheduled to appear in North Carolina court Friday to try and enforce the subpoena of Laura Hart McKinny, a screenwriting professor who interviewed Fuhrman and other Los Angeles police officers about their jobs. The defense thinks McKinny has tapes and transcripts that can show Fuhrman making numerous racist remarks.</P>



<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>

<P><B>JULY 26</B> - The third day of testimony over a blood preservative was highlighted by the defense accusing one of its own witnesses of being biased for the prosecution.</P>



<P>FBI Special Agent Roger Martz initially testified that his tests on a bloody sock and a blood stain from the gate behind Nicole Brown Simpson's house suggested the presence of a chemical preservative, EDTA. Later Martz said that he could not identify any EDTA on the samples.</P>



<P>He then reiterated that tests on his own unpreserved blood found a level of EDTA presence similar to the levels found in the evidence stains. However, Martz had to admit that he actually was unable to positively identify any EDTA in his blood or in the blood on the socks and gate.</P>



<P>Before starting his re-direct examination, defense lawyer, Robert Blasier asked Judge Ito to declare Martz a "hostile witness," allowing him to ask leading questions of the witness.</P>



<P>The prosecution objected, but the judge agreed with the defense. Blasier proceeded to accuse Martz of biased testing and research.</P>



<P>Blasier suggested that Martz was biased in favor of the prosecution, in part by eliciting testimony that the witness was surprised at being called to testify for the defense. Martz denied the accusation. The defense called Martz because he conducted the tests that defense witness Fredric Rieders used to determine the presence of EDTA.</P>



<P>Martz said that environmental conditions would not affect EDTA because it is a stable substance. But he admitted under questioning by Blasier that he was not aware of any literature to support this conclusion.</P>



<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>

<P><B>JULY 27</B> - In a day shortened by a juror's illness, the defense presented physical evidence to supports its theory that police conspired to frame O.J. Simpson for murder.</P>



<P>Blood splatter expert Herbert MacDonell told jurors that the stains on socks found in Simpson's bedroom looked like they were applied to the fabric, and that some of the blood had seeped through - something that could not have happened if Simpson was wearing the socks at the time.</P>



<P>MacDonell of the International Association of Blood Stain Pattern Analysts in Corning, New York, examined the socks on April 2, 1995 and concluded the stains were not splatter stains. He said the stain on the ankle of one sock was more consistent with a smear.</P>



<P>Splatter stains, he explained, are projected by a liquid and would go through the fibers while a smear remains only on the surface of the fiber. Even the drops of blood that look like splatters, he said, were likely caused by dripping because the dimensions of the spot were too large to be consistent with blood projecting.</P>



<P>MacDonell also testified that he saw evidence on the inner surface of one side of the sock that the blood had soaked through the outer surface of the opposite end -- suggesting that it must have soaked through while no one was wearing the sock. He said he saw six or seven little red balls that appeared to be blood bonded to the fiber. The fact that they were balls, he said, indicated that they were wet when they came into contact with the fiber. This testimony contradicted the testimony of prosecution witness Gary Sims of the California Department of Justice. Sims said the blood inside Simpson's sock consisted of flecks that had already dried when they landed there.</P>



<P>MacDonell's testimony was cut short when a juror became ill during the lunch break and was taken to the hospital. The juror, a 43-year-old black male, reportedly was suffering from chest pains, dizziness and stomach cramps.</P>



<P>In addition to testimony offered Thursday, Simpson's attorneys forged ahead with other aspects of their conspiracy theory.</P>



<P>First, they told Judge Lance Ito that they have three more witnesses prepared to testify about hearing Detective Mark Fuhrman use a racial epithet.</P>



<P>The judge has already authorized the defense to call two witnesses to describe Fuhrman as a racist who loathed intermarried couples and routinely called blacks "niggers" -- charges Fuhrman has denied under oath.</P>



<P>Because Simpson's lawyers have not produced any concrete evidence that Fuhrman planted anything, Deputy District Attorney Cheri Lewis told Judge Ito that the detective's racial attitudes were virtually irrelevant, especially since the purported episodes would have occurred eight or nine years ago. That minimal relevance, she said, was outweighed by its impact on a jury that is three-fourths black.</P>



<P>"Because of the inflammatory nature of the remarks at issue, especially in front of this predominantly African-American jury, it does have a substantially undue impact on the People," Lewis said. "With all due respect to people of color everywhere, I submit that whether or not he used the n-word at some point in the remote past is not a material part of his testimony."</P>



<P>But defense lawyer Gerald F. Uelmen told Judge Ito that what the defense wanted to show was not that Fuhrman had planted the glove but that he was a liar.</P>



<P>By attempting to "present himself to this jury as a choir boy," he said, Fuhrman "dug a hole for the prosecution, a very deep hole." To exclude the evidence, he argued, "would simply be cutting corners by cutting the heart out of the defense case."</P>



<P>The judge delayed ruling on the issue.</P>



<P>He also did not rule on whether the defense could ask the director of the police department's crime laboratory about a news leak earlier in the case. He scheduled a hearing for Monday morning when KNBC-TV reporter Tracie Savage may be asked to disclose her source of the report.</P>



<P>The defense contends the news report, which gave DNA test results on a bloody sock found in Simpson's bedroom before the tests were even conducted, suggests the anonymous source of the leak knew the results ahead of time because the evidence had been planted.</P>



<P>Deputy District Attorney Hank Goldberg ridiculed that notion, calling it the defense's "chain of illogic."</P>



<P>Judge Ito also scheduled a second tour of the crime scene and Simpson's house for August 20. This tour will take place at night, around the same time the killings occurred. A previous tour of the scene was held during the day.</P>



<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>

<P><B>JULY 28</B> - A North Carolina judge refused to compel a professor and screenwriter to testify in Los Angeles or to produce videotapes that the defense claims help prove that Detective Mark Furhman is a racist and liar.</P>



<P>The tapes were part of Laura McKinny's research for a script about the Los Angeles police department. The videotapes allegedly show Fuhrman using the Ku Klux Klan title "Grand Dragon" to describe himself, alluding to "Hitler's celebration" and speaking of "beating niggers."</P>



<P>But Judge William Wood ruled the tapes were irrelevant and collateral evidence in the murder trial -- even if they showed Furhman's alleged racist attitudes. The judge indicated that he was swayed to rule in favor of the prosecution on the issue because McKinney was writing fiction and Furhman was serving as a technical consultant.</P>



<P>Fuhrman "was helping with character development," the judge ruled. "It was dialogue for a Hollywood movie, and Hollywood movies often contain curse words and racial epithets. There was nothing of (McKinney's) evidence that tended to show that Detective Furhman had it in for Simpson."</P>



<P>Defense attorney Johnnie Cochran, Jr., who argued the motion, said the defense would appeal the ruling.</P>



<P>The defense still has at least two other witnesses prepared to testify that Fuhrman had used racial slurs in the past decade. It also plans to ask Judge Ito to instruct the jury that if it believes Fuhrman was not telling the truth in any part of his testimony then they may disregard the whole of his testimony.</P>



<P>Meanwhile, there was no testimony in the trial because of the illness of a 43-year-old juror who was taken to a hospital after complaining of stomach pains and dizziness during the lunch hour on Thursday.</P>



<P>The defense asked Judge Ito to reconsider his earlier ruling on the admissibility of Christian Reichardt's proposed testimony. The defense wants Reichardt, the former boyfriend of Faye Resnick, to testify about her alleged drug use or suggestions that she might have been the intended victim of angry drug dealers.</P>



<P>Defense attorney Carl Douglas argued that there was "very slight circumstantial evidence" that Simpson had a motive to commit the murders. He argued that all the prosecution has offered to show motive was that Simpson was carrying out "some final act of control." As a result, Douglas argued, the defense should be able to produce evidence of another possible motive.</P>



<P>Prosecutor Cheri Lewis argued that the defense had not presented any evidence Resnick was the intended victim of a drug-related killing.</P>

<H2>Week by Week in the O.J. Simpson Criminal Trial</H2>



<H3>Week 28 (July 31 - August 4, 1995)</H3>



<P><B>JULY 31</B> - Did the defense blink?</P>



<P>Defense lawyers decided against pursuing an important line of questioning after prosecutor Marcia Clark suggested she might use photographs and videotapes to link O.J. Simpson to a pair of incriminating gloves.</P>



<P>Clark didn't disclose how she would prove that the gloves Simpson wore while broadcasting football games were the same gloves worn as he allegedly stabbed to death his ex-wife and her friend.</P>



<P>At a hearing in which the defense asked Judge Lance Ito to bar prosecutors from presenting the pictures and videos, the judge asked Clark, "Can you establish the foundation that those gloves are the same gloves?"</P>



<P>"Yes, I can," she replied confidently.</P>



<P>After a pause, Ito said, "Interesting."</P>



<P>The defense wanted to offer testimony from bloodstain expert Herbert MacDonell who conducted an experiment to determine the extent to which gloves soaked in blood would shrink. Before questioning MacDonell, defense attorney Peter Neufeld asked Judge Ito to prevent Clark from displaying the shots of Simpson wearing gloves at football games during her cross-examination of MacDonell.</P>



<P>The judge said he would rule on the matter when it arose in cross-examination. Neufeld then announced he would not pursue the line of questioning.</P>



<P>The bloodstained gloves have haunted the prosecution since Simpson was asked to try them on in court. Simpson tugged and pulled on them and told jurors they were too small. Deputy District Attorney Christopher Darden later had Simpson try on new gloves of the same style. Those fit, and Darden suggested the murder gloves had shrunk. MacDonell was expected to testify that blood-soaked gloves would not shrink as much as the prosecution claims.</P>



<P>The photographs and videos of Simpson wearing dark gloves at cold weather football games have circulated for months, but the prosecution did not try to introduce them into evidence. So unless the defense introduces testimony about them, it is unlikely the photos could be used as prosecution rebuttal evidence.</P>



<P>Instead of discussing gloves, MacDonell again testified on his conclusions that bloodstains on the socks had seeped through from one side to the other. The finding, he said, indicated no foot was in the sock when blood was applied to it, supporting the defense contention that the blood was planted.</P>



<P>In her cross-examination of MacDonell, Clark suggested possible explanations of what the witness had called a "compression" bloodstain on one of the socks.</P>



<P>Clark posed the possibility that Nicole Brown Simpson reached out with bloody hands and grabbed her ex-husband's ankle during the attack. She also suggested that Simpson could have touched the socks with his own bloody fingers as he took them off.</P>



<P>MacDonell told jurors such activities could cause the kind of compression stains he described on the stand. And he acknowledged that his original report described "swipes" of blood on the sock rather than compressions, but he said they are the virtually the same type of stains.</P>



<P>Before the glove arguments, the defense tried to question a television reporter about a story she broadcast September 21, 1994 about one of the socks found at the foot of Simpson's bed. She reported that DNA testing had disclosed Nicole Brown Simpson's blood in its fibers. Since her report gave DNA results before the tests were conducted, the defense suggests the anonymous source of the leak knew what the results would be because the evidence had been planted.</P>



<P>Tracie Savage of KNBC-TV said she got the information from "knowledgeable sources close to the case" but refused to identify them further, saying she "gave my word as a journalist that I would not reveal their identities."</P>



<P>She then invoked the California Shield Law, which protects reporters from being forced to disclose confidential sources.</P>



<P>Judge Ito did not immediately decide if her information is so crucial to Simpson's defense that she must divulge it despite the shield. He said he would study the issue.</P>



<P>Defense attorney Robert Shapiro then told the court that another journalist, Joseph Bosco, used the same information for a story in Penthouse magazine and would testify that his source was a member of the Los Angeles Police Department.</P>



<P>Meanwhile, defense attorney Johnnie Cochran Jr., implored Judge Ito to intervene in a North Carolina ruling that denied the defense access to a screenwriting professor's tapes of interviews with Detective Mark Fuhrman.</P>



<P>The defense claims that on the tapes, Fuhrman talks about "framing people, setting people up and filing false reports." The defense also filed notice in North Carolina that the judge's ruling would be appealed.</P>



<P>"These tapes must come to California," Cochran told Ito. "This is absolutely critical, and we are going to go all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court unless she comes forward voluntarily."</P>



<P>The defense has accused Fuhrman of being a racist who framed Simpson. And Simpson's attorneys say the tapes will impeach Fuhrman, who testified earlier that he hadn't used the word "nigger" to describe blacks in the last 10 years.</P>



<P>The prosecution contends Fuhrman, who was working as a consultant on McKinny's fictional project, was role-playing on the tapes.</P>



<P>Ito said he didn't believe he had any jurisdiction over the North Carolina decision but added that he had never faced such a request before.</P>



<P>The judge handed the defense another setback when he issued a written refusal to reconsider his order barring testimony by Christian Reichardt, a former boyfriend of Faye Resnick. The defense had hoped to use Reichardt to lay the groundwork for its theory that the murders were committed by drug dealers pursuing Resnick, a self-described cocaine user.</P>



<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>

<P><B>AUGUST 1</B> - Judge Lance Ito handed the defense a victory by ruling it could attack the DNA testing procedures at the police crime laboratory.</P>



<P>"This is the heart of our defense," attorney Barry Scheck argued, adding that "the key defense contention regarding DNA is that because of substandard practices in this county, key evidence was cross-contaminated. . . . This has been our contention since opening statements."</P>



<P>Prosecutors objected to the new phase of defense testimony, saying it could be misleading and would unnecessarily prolong the trial.</P>



<P>Judge Ito, who heard arguments outside the presence of the jury, said he would allow the testimony out of fairness because the prosecution was given great latitude in presenting its elaborate DNA evidence. He explained that PCR-based DNA testing is sophisticated and subject to problems like contamination. Therefore, the judge said defense expert Dr. John Gerdes could testify about systemic problems with PCR and widespread contamination within the lab. The judge told Scheck to complete his questioning of Gerdes within six hours.</P>



<P>Before the DNA hearing, blood spatter expert Herbert MacDonell completed his testimony. He told jurors that a murderer's foot couldn't have been inside a sock when it was stained with Nicole Brown Simpson's blood. The defense contends the blood was taken from a vial of her blood and smeared on the sock.</P>



<P>Deputy District Attorney Marcia Clark offered a different explanation in her cross-examination, suggesting the socks were wet with perspiration and blood before they were taken off and left flat, allowing blood to seep through. MacDonell said that was possible.</P>



<P>However, in redirect examination, the witness said his examination of microscopic photographs taken by another forensic scientist showed no sign of perspiration that would have diluted blood on the sock.</P>



<P>While MacDonell was the only witness to testify before the jury, the day was filled with numerous developments and arguments before the judge.</P>



<P>Michele Kestler, director of the Los Angeles Police Department crime lab, testified outside the presence of the jury that she thought a news leak about DNA tests on the socks came from outside her lab. She conducted no investigation beyond speaking with a couple of employees who had access to the test results.</P>



<P>"I just feel that our employees have too much integrity and honesty and have been involved in many, many cases before, and we have never been a source of any leaks," she said.</P>



<P>The defense claims the leak showed that someone was determined to frame Simpson with his ex-wife's blood by reporting that DNA tests had disclosed results when the socks had not yet been sent out for testing.</P>



<P>Author Joseph Bosco, also outside the jury's presence, testified he wrote a Penthouse magazine article attributing the socks leak to a Los Angeles police officer. He said his article was accurate. Bosco refused to give more details. He invoked the California Shield Law, which protects reporters from revealing sources. The judge didn't immediately decide if Bosco would be forced to give more information.</P>



<P>The defense presented previous testimony from jail nurse Thano Peratis who drew blood from Simpson's arm at police headquarters the day after the murders.</P>



<P>A videotape of Peratis' testimony from last summer's preliminary hearing was played, and jurors heard the nurse say he drew approximately 8 millimeters of blood from Simpson, placed it in a test tube containing the lab preservative EDTA and handed it to a detective who placed the vial in a gray envelope.</P>



<P>The defense contends 1.5 millimeters of that blood is missing and that the police sprinkled it on evidence to link Simpson to the crime.</P>



<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>

<P><B>AUGUST 2</B> - An expert defense witness, who has studied the proficiency of DNA labs across the country, said the Los Angeles Police Department's crime lab has the worst levels of contamination that he has ever seen and should be shut down.</P>



<P>Dr. John Gerdes, the clinical director at Immunological Associates in Denver, who has investigated 23 forensic cases in cities across the United States, said the work of the prosecution's DNA experts is -- at best -- unreliable.</P>



<P>"The LAPD has a substantial contamination problem," Gerdes said. "It is chronic in the sense that it doesn't go away."</P>



<P>Defense lawyer Barry Scheck presented a chart showing a list of problems in forensic testing that create a higher risk of contamination and error. These include dirty samples, minuscule sample sizes, mixed samples from unknown sources, multiple handling, and statistical controversy.</P>



<P>Gerdes criticized the work of LAPD criminalists Dennis Fung, Andrea Mazzolla and Collin Yamauchi, all of whom testified for the prosecution. Compared to other labs, he said the LAPD handles its samples more and its proficiency tests are lax.</P>



<P>Since the LAPD collected the all the biological evidence used by the prosecution, tests based on that evidence by other laboratories are highly questionable, he said.</P>



<P>Judge Lance Ito allowed six hours for his direct examination of Gerdes, leaving Scheck less than an hour to conclude when court resumes. On cross-examination, the prosecution is likely to point out that in the Simpson case the LAPD conducted tests that indicate there was no contamination. In addition, there is a record of instances in which Gerdes erroneously identified contamination at the LAPD.</P>



<P>The prosecution is also expected to bring out that Gerdes' tests are limited to PCR-based DNA testing. Even if his criticism is correct, the more definitive RFLP tests also showed Simpson's genetic markers.</P>

<P><B>AUGUST 3</B> - Thursday's Developments: An expert defense witness continued to cast doubt on the prosecution's DNA evidence and the Los Angeles Police Department's crime lab.</P>



<P>But under cross-examination, Dr. John Gerdes, a microbiologist and the clinical director at Immunological Associates in Denver, admitted that he has never conducted a forensic experiment and could not categorically deny that O.J. Simpson and Ronald Goldman were the source of the blood found in Simpson's Ford Bronco.</P>



<P>Prosecutor Clarke attacked Gerdes' qualifications, getting Gerdes to admit that he is not a member of any professional associations in the forensic community and does not attend professional meeting on PCR testing.</P>



<P>Nevertheless, Gerdes has testified 23 times against the use of PCR-based DNA testing, Clarke pointed out.</P>



<P>To prove that PCR testing is sound, Clarke noted that several scientists whom Gerdes respects use the procedure, which is largely accepted in the scientific community.</P>



<P>Clarke buttressed this point by questioning Gerdes about several articles that attest to PCR's reliability.</P>



<P>Gerdes clung to his contention that the contamination at the LAPD crime lab rendered key DNA evidence unreliable as Clarke questioned him about several instances when he allegedly erred in reporting lab contamination.</P>



<P>Earlier in the day, Judge Lance Ito scheduled a hearing for next Tuesday on whether the defense should be required to turn over a tape recording from Gretchen Stockdale, a former girlfriend of Simpson's. On the tape, recorded a few hours before Nicole Brown Simpson was murdered, Simpson allegedly said he is "totally unattached with everybody."</P>



<P>The prosecution claims Stockdale gave the tape to a defense investigator and that the defense refuses to hand it over. At issue is whether the tape is an original. If it is, Judge Ito said the prosecution is entitled to it.</P>



<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>

<P><B>AUGUST 4</B> - The prosecution revealed that a new, but unfinished, DNA test would supply further potent evidence to tie O.J. Simpson to the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman. But Judge Lance Ito said the tests may have been started too late to be used in the trial.</P>



<P>Outside the presence of the jury, prosecutor Rockne Harmon said that the test on blood found under the console of Simpson's Ford Bronco tentatively shows a match with Simpson and Goldman's blood.</P>



<P>Thus far, no evidence has been presented to show that Simpson and Goldman ever had contact or that Goldman had an opportunity to be inside the Bronco. Harmon described it as the "other shoe" in the state's effort to use DNA to prove its case.</P>



<P>But Judge Ito said that he had difficulty with the fact that the California Department of Justice was slow in beginning the test -- known as Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphisms or RFLP -- which can take several weeks to perform, but is considered more accurate than the other type of DNA test performed on evidence in this case -- known as Polymerase Chain Reaction or PCR.</P>



<P>Harmon disclosed the tentative test results at a hearing to determine if the prosecution could ask defense DNA expert Dr. Gerdes if an RFLP test on blood found in the Bronco would corroborate the PCR results. Dr. Gerdes has testified that DNA evidence has been tainted by sloppy police work and that PCR tests are unreliable.</P>



<P>Judge Ito refused to allow the question.</P>



<P>Under cross-examination, Dr. Gerdes conceded that not all of the blood samples were extracted for DNA by police criminalists at the Los Angeles Police Department crime lab. These samples were sent to laboratories that the witness has not attacked for contaminating evidence.</P>



<P>After prosecutor George "Woody" Clarke objected to several of Dr. Gerdes' responses, Judge Ito ordered the witness to answer the question and the doctor admitted the other labs performed the extractions.</P>



<P>But Dr. Gerdes added that the samples "went through the LAPD" if only for packaging and transportation.</P>



<P>Clarke also had Dr. Gerdes acknowledge that his lab billed the defense $30,000 for his work in the case in an effort to show that the doctor's conclusions may be biased.</P>

<H2>Week by Week in the O.J. Simpson Criminal Trial</H2>



<H3>Week 29 (August 7 - 11, 1995)</H3>



<P><B>AUGUST 7</B> - The tape recordings of retired Detective Mark Fuhrman allegedly spewing racial epithets came closer towards the courtroom where O.J. Simpson is on trial for murder.</P>



<P>A North Carolina appeals court upheld Judge Lance Ito's subpoena Monday, overturning a lower court ruling that Laura Hart McKinny, a writer and college professor, did not have to testify on her screenplay collaboration with Fuhrman. McKinny was ordered to appear along with any tapes, transcripts and documents she may have of her interviews with Fuhrman.</P>



<P>Judge Ito has determined McKinny is a material witness but has yet to rule on the admissibility of the tapes, leaving a possibility that the jury may never hear them.</P>



<P>Fuhrman and McKinny collaborated on "Men Against Women," a screenplay based on a sexist Los Angeles Police fraternity to which Fuhrman belonged. On tapes, recorded between 1985 and 1994, Fuhrman allegedly uses the racial slur "nigger" repeatedly and discusses methods of planting evidence.</P>



<P>Fuhrman is the detective who scaled the fence at Simpson's home and found a bloody glove on June 13, 1994, about 12 hours after Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman were found stabbed to death. The defense claims that Fuhrman is a racist with particular animosity toward inter-racial marriages and that he took part in a conspiracy to frame the former football star.</P>



<P>Under cross-examination, Fuhrman denied using the word "nigger." Defense lawyers plan to use McKinny's tapes and testimony to discredit Fuhrman's testimony and advance their conspiracy theory. The last of these tapes were recorded after the murders.</P>



<P>"The ruling in North Carolina today is probably the keymost important ruling in the case so far, from the standpoint of Mr. Simpson," defense lawyer Johnnie Cochran, Jr. said.</P>



<P>Earlier in the day, defense DNA expert Dr. John Gerdes stated under cross-examination that he is only offering his analysis that contamination had rendered the prosecution's DNA evidence unreliable. He said he testified about possibilities of what could have occurred, not what happened.</P>



<P>Gerdes had criticized PCR-based DNA tests. But Prosecutor George "Woody" Clarke forced Gerdes to admit that the PCR tests were cross-checked by subsequent RFLP tests.</P>



<P>Clarke also confronted Gerdes on contradictory statements he had made on scientific methodology and on alleged mistakes Gerdes made in studying DNA labs for contamination.</P>



<P>On re-direct, defense lawyer Barry Scheck tried to establish that if evidence was cross-contaminated by Los Angeles Police Department criminalists when it was collected, it would not matter how many subsequent tests run by different labs tested consistently with one another. The evidence would have already been tainted.</P>



<P>Criminalists can contaminate evidence by not changing gloves and handling equipment frequently enough and by handling samples of blood with high amounts of DNA at the same time it handles degraded blood samples, Gerdes said.</P>



<P>Professor Speed took the stand in the afternoon and criticized the prosecution's statistics experts for not including laboratory failure rates. He said he reviewed the testimony of prosecution expert witnesses and found that their calculations reveal nothing about the mistakes in collecting or processing evidence.</P>



<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>

<P><B>AUGUST 8</B> - A model and friend of O.J. Simpson's took the stand outside the presence of the jury to provide insights into the whereabouts of a voice-mail message that Simpson left for her a few hours before Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman were murdered.</P>



<P>Gretchen Stockdale, who described Simpson as a friend, said the two of them met in 1988 and would see one another once in a while and speak on the phone. They began talking occasionally about Simpson's relationship with his wife in 1993, Stockdale said.</P>



<P>On June 12, 1994, the night of the murders, Prosecutor Marcia Clark asked Stockdale if Simpson left a message that said, in part, "Hey, Gretchen, sweetheart, its Orenthal James, who is finally at a place in his life where he is like, totally, totally unattached with everybody. Ha, Ha!"</P>



<P>Stockdale said it sounded like the message she retrieved June 13 from her answering service. She said she saved the message for a week, and then asked the service for a taped copy, which she later gave to defense investigator William Pavlik.</P>



<P>By holding a tape recorder up to the phone, Stockdale made a second recording, "just in case the original got lost," she said. But when she later needed the tape for another purpose, she recorded over it, she said.</P>



<P>The defense has refused to turn over the original recording, claiming that they have no duty to do so. Judge Ito ordered the prosecution to call the voice-mail company to find if a copy of the message can be obtained.</P>



<P>Earlier in the day, Judge Ito excused himself from hearing a defense request for police internal affairs documents relating to an investigation on police leaks to the press. Capt. Peggy York, Judge Ito's wife, is a high ranking member of the Los Angeles Police Department's Internal Affairs Division. Though she was not involved in the probe, Judge Ito said he felt more comfortable stepping aside in this matter.</P>



<P>Defense lawyer Gerald Uelman argued that the defense is entitled to statements LAPD criminalists Michele Kestler, Colin Yamauchi and Greg Matheson made to investigators. The three criminalists testified for the prosecution and their statements are therefore material to the issues of the trial, Uelman said. The defense has argued that finding the source of the press leaks will help reveal the alleged police conspiracy against Simpson.</P>



<P>Superior Court Judge John Reed, who heard arguments from Uelman and lawyers for the city of Los Angeles, ordered the defense to provide a "declaration of materiality" Wednesday morning to Judge Ito. He held that if Judge Ito decides in favor of the defense, he will decide if the statements should be turned over.</P>



<P>Judge Ito's decision should influence his ruling on whether he will pierce the California shield law that protects journalists from revealing their sources and compel freelance writer Joe Bosco and TV reporter Tracie Savage to testify on press leaks, Uelman said.</P>



<P>The jury heard testimony for less than an hour and a half. Prosecutor Rockne Harmon confronted defense statistics expert Terence Speed with a letter he wrote to prosecution witness Bruce Weir that seems to contradict some of Speed's testimony.</P>



<P>In the 1992 letter, Speed mocks assumptions about the methodology in a Nuclear Regulatory Committee report that he strongly supported on direct examination.</P>



<P>Harmon also asked Speed why he refused to speak to Weir, a friend and fellow statistician, before testifying. Speed said he felt uncomfortable disagreeing with Weir but that he believes Weir's population frequency calculations that the prosecution is using are faulty in that they assume no error occurred in DNA testing.</P>



<P>Harmon got Speed to concede that if jurors decide there was no laboratory error then they can assume Weir's numbers are correct. "You have simply alerted the jury to the possibility of certain errors," Harmon said.</P>



<P>In other arguments, Judge Ito granted Prosecutor Brian Kelberg's request for the defense to turn over notes that Dr. Michael Boden and Dr. Barbara Wolf, two potential witnesses, who took notes during the testimony of coroner Dr. Lakshmanan Sathyavagiswaran.</P>



<P>The defense filed three motions. The first asks Judge Ito to bar the prosecution from introducing pictures that allegedly show Simpson at a football game wearing the same sort of gloves found covered in blood at the murder scene and Simpson's home.</P>



<P>The defense contends that there are no scientifically accepted methods to positively identify the gloves based on photography and that such evidence would be outside the scope of the prosecution's rebuttal case.</P>



<P>In a separate motion, the defense seeks to limit the cross-examination of Kary Mullis, the inventor of PCR-based DNA test that was used on key prosecution evidence. Mullis has an eccentric lifestyle, and he admits to having used LSD and other illegal drugs. Among other topics, the defense wants to stop the prosecution from asking Mullis questions about social relationships, domestic discord and his use of controlled substances.</P>



<P>The defense is also seeking the appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate alleged police perjury, specifically in relation to Detective Mark Fuhrman, whom they say lied on the witness stand about harboring racist slurs against blacks.</P>



<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>

<P><B>AUGUST 9</B> - Judge Ito ruled that the defense failed to prove that information allegedly leaked to the press by law enforcement officials was material to the case.</P>



<P>As a result, defense lawyers will not by able to compel journalists Tracie Savage and Joe Bosco to testify, and they will not have access to a Los Angeles Police Internal Affairs Department probe into the source of the press leaks.</P>



<P>After the ruling, the defense said it had no witnesses to testify and Judge Ito recessed the trial until Thursday.</P>



<P>The defense had hoped to ask Savage why she was able to report, several months before DNA tests were concluded and released, that blood consistent with Nicole Simpson's was found on a sock in her husband's bedroom.</P>



<P>The defense said that press leaks were part of the police conspiracy to plant evidence to incriminate Simpson.</P>



<P>Savage and Bosco, who wrote an article about press leaks in the Simpson Case for Penthouse magazine, invoked the California Shield Law, under which journalists cannot be forced to reveal the names of confidential sources unless the information will "materially assist" a criminal defendant.</P>



<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>

<P><B>AUGUST 10</B> - A world-renowned pathologist contradicted the prosecution's theory of the stabbing murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Robert Goldman.</P>



<P>Dr. Michael Baden, a forensic pathologist who led a commission to reopen the investigation of President John F. Kennedy's assassination and has investigated deaths in Croatia and the Gaza Strip on behalf of human rights groups, said that Nicole Brown Simpson struggled with her assailant or assailants and that she was not lying on the ground when she was killed, as the prosecution contends.</P>



<P>Defense lawyer Robert Shapiro used Dr. Baden to undermine the testimony of Los Angeles coroner, Dr. Lakshmanan Sathyavagiswaran, a prosecution witness who told the jury he believed that the fatal wounds to Goldman and Simpson were inflicted by someone more than six feet tall. O.J. Simpson stands six feet, one inch.</P>



<P>Dr. Baden said the evidence in this case does not give a medical examiner sufficient information to determine the physique of the assailant or assailants, nor if there was more than one knife involved in the murders. It would be "easier to tell whether or not a person who was the subject of cremation had a mustache," he said.</P>



<P>Working on the case since June 14, 1994, two days after the murders, Dr. Baden described numerous mistakes by the coroner's office and police work that have diminished the value of the evidence.</P>



<P>He said important trace evidence could have been lost because Nicole Brown Simpson's hands were not protected in transportation and that investigators should have done a better job determining the origin of blood drops on her back.</P>



<P>Mold on the victim's clothing, which he viewed at the coroner's office, is indicative of the poor conditions there, he said. He noted several autopsy mistakes, including a bruise to Nicole Brown's head and cuts in her Adam's Apple not recorded in the report.</P>



<P>On cross-examination prosecutor Brian Kelberg had Dr. Baden reveal that he has billed the defense around $100,000 for his services and may bill another $65,000 for additional hours spent on the case. The doctor also told the court that he never published any article in the areas that he was testifying about and that his primary area of expertise is death by drug abuse.</P>



<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>

<P><B>AUGUST 11</B> - The gruesome autopsy and crime scene pictures of a stabbed and slashed Nicole Brown Simpson were again displayed before the jury as prosecutor Brian Kelberg attacked the theories of renowned forensic pathologist and defense expert witness Dr. Michael Baden.</P>



<P>Kelberg portrayed Dr. Baden as a hired gun who drew conclusions about the night of the murders with few facts.</P>



<P>On direct examination, Dr. Baden contradicted the testimony of Los Angeles Coroner Dr. Lakshmanan Sathyavagiswaran, who said the murderer most likely knocked down Nicole Brown, killed Ronald Goldman and then returned to lift back her head and slash her throat.</P>



<P>In Dr. Baden's theory, Nicole Brown desperately fought for her life and her murder occurred later on June 12, 1994 than the prosecution contends.</P>



<P>Dr. Baden had pointed to several defensive wounds on Nicole Brown's body. But Kelberg forced Dr. Baden to admit that those wounds do not reveal how long the struggle lasted. The term "defensive wound" is something of a misnomer in that someone can receive such wounds even if that person is not in a defensive position, Dr. Baden said.</P>



<P>Though witnesses on both sides have criticized the autopsies of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman, Kelberg's questioning aimed to minimize the autopsy's harmful effect on the prosecution's case.</P>



<P>Though the Los Angeles coroner did not do an excellent job, the autopsies were better than most and even "better than the autopsy of President Kennedy," said Dr. Baden, who led a commission several years ago to reopen the investigation of the slain president's murder.</P>



<P>As it has been throughout the trial, Friday's session ended at noon. Judge Lance Ito grew impatient with Kelberg and told the prosecutor to listen to the jurors' groans as testimony stretched into lunch time. Kelberg pleaded first for another 15 minutes, then for another five, before finishing.</P>

<H2>Week by Week in the O.J. Simpson Criminal Trial</H2>



<H3>Week 30 (August 14 - 18, 1995)</H3>



<P><B>AUGUST 14</B> - The trial sidetracked into the re-litigation of a case called Sconce, in which a man was convicted of poisoning his victim.</P>



<P>And as often has happened in the case, Judge Lance Ito called the Sconce issues "collateral," but nevertheless allowed prosecutors to bring up the poisoning case, in which a key defense witness allegedly made mistakes about the cause of death,.</P>



<P>The witness, Dr. Fredric Rieders, testified for the defense several weeks ago about traces of EDTA blood samples found at the Bundy and Rockinghamcrime scenes. His cross-examination was interrupted July 25, when he had to leave the country.</P>



<P>So when Prosecutor Marcia Clark continued her cross-examination Monday, she immediately attacked Rieders about the Sconce case. In that case, Rieders tested the victim's blood and discovered the presence of oleandrin, a poison. Clark tried to show that another doctor on the case performed a similar test on the victim's blood and did not find any poison. Rieders angrily explained that the doctor tested a completely different tissue, and that the two doctors findings were not inconsistent.</P>



<P>As Clark and Rieders wrangled back and forth about the case, Judge Ito tried to put an end to the fracas by declaring, "Let's try the Simpson case...sometime today."</P>



<P>Clark then questioned Rieders whether an abnormal amount of the preservative EDTA was found in blood stains at the Bundy back gate and on socks found in Simpson's bedroom. She reminded the witness that he did not do any of the testing (Rieders analyzed FBI test results) and won a concession from Rieders that he could not exclude all other compounds as a source for the EDTA traces.</P>



<P>Clark reminded Rieders that EDTA commonly is used as a food preservative. She also pressed him about the average level of EDTA found in a healthy person--suggesting it would not be abnormal to find EDTA in the blood samples. But Rieders insisted that not only was EDTA present, but the amount was consistent with having come from a tube of preserved blood.</P>



<P>Meanwhile, the familiar theme of police incompetence resurfaced when the defense called Michelle Kestler to the witness stand. Kestler is director of the Los Angeles Police Department crime lab and was assistant director at the time of the murders. Defense attorney Peter Neufeld questioned Kestler about her role in the investigation. Kestler said that she oversaw some of the Simpson case but that Gregory Matheson oversaw most of it.</P>



<P>In other developments: @ The attorneys for detective Mark Fuhrman asserted the detective's right to tape recordings that defense lawyers say will prove he is a liar. Fuhrman's attorneys said the tapes belong in part to Fuhrman because they contain his voice.</P>



<P>Attorney Laurie Butler also said Fuhrman could be harmed by public release of the tapes and can't defend himself without hearing them.</P>



<P>"There could be further injury and defamation to Detective Fuhrman, and he has no ability whatsoever to rebut any of this because he's been denied any access to his own voice," Butler argued.</P>



<P>On the tapes, which the defense subpoenaed from a North Carolina screenwriting professor, Fuhrman reportedly makes racially derogatory remarks and utters an offensive slur 27 times. Robert Tourtelot, another Fuhrman attorney, has said the detective was acting in the role of consultant on a fictional work and was not speaking for himself.</P>



<P>Defense attorney Johnnie Cochran Jr. angrily opposed Fuhrman's request, saying the defense doesn't have to share information it plans to use to discredit a witness.</P>



<P>"They don't have a right to those tapes," Cochran argued. "It's not a screenplay....They can talk to their client if they want to know what he said."</P>



<P>Laura Hart McKinny, who recorded the tapes, won a protective order from Judge Ito limiting the number of people allowed to hear them, and Fuhrman was not given access. Judge Ito suggested that McKinny be asked to give Fuhrman a copy without requiring a court order.</P>



<P>The judge is expected to rule sometime this week on how much of the material is admissible. Cochran suggested that up to six of the 12 hours of taped conversation may be relevant.</P>



<UL TYPE=DISC>

	<LI>The defense indicated it will oppose the planned nighttime jury visit to the crime scene and Simpson's estate. The jury has already visited both locations in daylight, but prosecutors want them to return at night, close to the time they say the killings occurred.<P>



	<LI>Defense lawyer Gerald Uelmen argued unsuccessfully for the chance to tell jurors about news leaks that preceded the trial.

</UL>



<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>

<P><B>AUGUST 15</B> - The issues of race and alleged police misconduct catapulted the O.J. Simpson trial into utter upheaval.</P>



<P>The issues ultimately forced Judge Lance Ito to disqualify himself from one of the most crucial rulings of the case and could end his reign over the trial.</P>



<P>The district attorney's office is expected to ask the judge on Wednesday to disqualify himself from the remainder of the trial, the balance of which could center on ugly racial epithets and the alleged corruption of the Los Angeles Police Department.</P>



<P>The issues came to a head when the prosecution told Judge Ito that his wife, Los Angeles Police Captain Margaret York, was one of the alleged victims of detective Mark Fuhrman's rancor, revealed on a series of taped conversations with a North Carolina professor and screenwriter.</P>



<P>"I love my wife dearly, and I am wounded by criticism of her, as any spouse would be," Judge Ito told lawyers with the jury absent. His voice faltering and choked with emotion, the judge detailed his reasons for removing himself from making any decisions about the tapes. He said he was wounded by Fuhrman's disparaging remarks about his wife, and that a reasonable person could perceive any ruling on the admissibility of the tapes as unfair.</P>



<P>Prosecutors proclaimed that if the defense insists on playing the tapes for the jury, they would be forced to call York to in some way rebut the tapes.</P>



<P>Since Judge Ito knows that disparaging remarks were made about his wife, regardless of whether the remarks are deemed relevant, any ruling at all about the tapes may appear to be unfair. If he allows the tapes in, he could be perceived as doing so to punish Fuhrman. If he does not allow them in, he could be seen as doing so to avoid the embarrassment of issues regarding his wife coming before the jury.</P>



<P>The standards of judicial ethics in California hold that regardless of whether a judge can be fair, the appearance that he might not be is enough legal ground to have him removed from a case.</P>



<P>The prosecution contends that a judge may not remove himself piecemeal on some issues and not from the entire case.</P>



<P>But for now, Judge John Reid, a former prosecutor, will take charge of the issues surrounding the Fuhrman tapes. Judge Reid presided over a hearing last week regarding the release of statements made by potential defense witnesses in the course of an Internal Affairs investigation of press leaks. Judge Ito disqualified himself because York heads the internal affairs department.</P>



<P>Defense lawyers said Fuhrman is heard on the tapes making racist and sexist comments that contradict his earlier testimony regarding the police investigation of the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman in June 1994.</P>



<P>Fuhrman gave the tape-recorded interviews to a screenwriter between 1985 and 1994, laying out his inside knowledge of police brutality and misconduct, while consulting for a movie screenplay about the underside of police life. Fuhrman's attorneys insist he was only helping create dialogue for screenwriter Laura Hart McKinny.</P>



<P>Defense attorneys contend Fuhrman is expressing his own racist views on the tapes, which they say contradict Fuhrman's sworn testimony that he never used an offensive racial term for blacks in the last decade.</P>



<P>The tapes reportedly show Fuhrman used the word dozens of times, and recount numerous episodes of police harassing black suspects, contriving evidence against them and acknowledging he participated in such activities himself. In addition, Fuhrman purportedly took repeated sexist shots at York, who was once his supervisor in the Los Angeles Police Department.</P>



<P>No concrete evidence has been offered that Fuhrman planted the glove. But defense lawyers told Judge Ito that the detective is heard on the tapes describing incidents in which police planted weapons on criminal suspects, stopped black people driving expensive cars for no reason and ripped up the driver's licenses of black people showing "attitude."</P>



<P>"This is a blockbuster! This is a bombshell!" defense counsel Johnnie Cochran Jr. exclaimed in describing the tapes. "This is perhaps the biggest thing that's happened in any case in this country in this decade!"</P>



<P>He complained about sealed and hidden personnel files regarding Fuhrman. He said over and over that "all of America" show know what Fuhrman said on the tapes and that there may be a cover up from Los Angeles to Sacramento by people trying to protect Fuhrman and the police department.</P>



<P>"This court, this jury and this country is going to hear these tapes," he vowed.</P>



<P>In arguing for the tapes' inclusion and against the judge removing himself from any aspects of the case, Cochran complained that another judge would not be able to decide fairly the issue of materiality of the tapes. He told the judge that only he knew the facts of the case well enough to make such a determination.</P>



<P>Clark conceded that Fuhrman's comments were offensive, but she nevertheless argued vehemently against allowing the jury to hear them. She maintained that the defense was only seeking to inflame the jurors' passions and thereby distract them from the central issue of who killed Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman.</P>



<P>She also maintained that she wanted the trial to go on. But, by seeming to back Judge Ito into a corner it appeared the prosecutor might prefer to start over with a different jury and, presumably, a new judge.</P>



<P>Clark offered to concede to the jury, in a stipulation, that Fuhrman had made racist remarks in the late 1980s. But Cochran, apparently foreseeing more impact from the tapes themselves, turned down the idea -- spurring Clark to accuse him testily of wanting to present the jury with "the biggest red herring there ever was."</P>



<P>But unless the defense team abandons the tapes, Clark said she would have to call York to the stand. York would presumably testify, as she stated last fall in an affidavit, that she barely recalled Fuhrman.</P>



<P>Cochran argued that York's testimony was irrelevant, and could even be redacted from the transcripts that Judge Ito would have to consider. At most, he said, Judge Ito should yield only the comparatively narrow question of whether his wife can be called as a witness.</P>



<P>"This man has committed perjury," Cochran said. "Your wife has nothing to do with that at all."</P>



<P>Even as Judge Ito pushed Clark on whether she wanted to press the question of whether he should continue presiding over the case, he seemed to add fuel to her arguments. He said, for instance, that "a reasonable concern this court could impartially rule on these material issues is there" because of Fuhrman's comments about his wife and her possible participation as a witness.</P>



<P>"All rulings involving Fuhrman witnesses would become suspect," Clark told the judge, who appeared alternately irritated and upset by the latest twist in the case.</P>



<P>In transcripts released Tuesday of a closed-door conference with Judge Ito on Monday, Clark acknowledged that on the tapes Fuhrman makes racist remarks about blacks, Mexicans, women and Jews.</P>



<P>Fuhrman also was quoted as saying: "I am the most important witness in the trial of the century. If I go down, their case goes bye-bye." Seeking to downplay Fuhrman's role, Clark said in court Tuesday, "I'm not saying Mark Fuhrman should be painted as a god or a hero, but he is certainly not a critical witness."</P>

<P><B>AUGUST 16</B> - Marcia Clark withdrew her request that Judge Lance Ito disqualify himself completely from the trial and announced the state's desire for him to rule on all but one matter.</P>



<P>She said that Judge Ito should rule on the admissibility of the taped interviews of Detective Mark Fuhrman but that Judge John Reid should determine the materiality and relevance of the testimony of Captain Margaret York. York is a high ranking officer in the Los Angeles Police Department's Internal Affairs Division and Judge Ito's wife.</P>



<P>On the tapes, Fuhrman disparages and insults Captain York.</P>



<P>After Judge Ito said Tuesday that he could not be impartial about evidence and testimony involving his wife, Clark called for him to be disqualified completely.</P>



<P>But when Wednesday's session began, Clark said, "We have determined that full recusal is not the appropriate course. Our faith in this court's wisdom and integrity has not been and will not be misplaced."</P>



<P>While Clark declared the prosecution's desire to have the current jury reach a verdict in Judge Ito's court, she attacked the prosecution for injecting race issues into the case. "The 'N' word has become their cornerstone," she said.</P>



<P>Defense lawyer Gerald Uelman attacked the prosecution for using the disqualification issue but accepted the proposal that Judge Reid hear only the Captain York issue.</P>



<P>Uelman told Judge Ito that the defense only wants to introduce specific portions of the Fuhrman tapes. According to reports, Fuhrman slurs African-Americans with the so-called 'N' word at least 30 times and speaks of police misconduct, perjury and planting evidence 17 times.</P>



<P>Judge Ito ordered the defense to submit an offer of proof in regard to the tapes, detailing what portions they want to play for the jury. After the prosecution files its opposition, the judge will hold hearings on the matter.</P>



<P>Following the ruling, lawyers vented their frustrations at one another in a verbal slugfest.</P>



<P>Defense lawyer Robert Shapiro accused Prosecutor Christopher Darden of raising the recusal issue as a ploy to pay back Judge Ito for harsh treatment in court. He called the matter "prosecutorial misconduct."</P>



<P>In recounting an off-the-record conversation in chambers Wednesday, Shapiro said Darden told Judge Ito the prosecution was angry with the judge for cutting short some prosecutors, ridiculing some of their questioning and embarrassing them before the jury.</P>



<P>The desire for more favorable treatment led the prosecution to seek judicial disqualification, Shapiro said. "We want the record to reflect our absolute and joint feelings that this is unethical conduct at its highest and we will pursue all remedies the law allows," he said.</P>



<P>Darden answered with sharp criticism of the defense for using racial issues to manipulate the media. "This case is a circus and they've made it a circus," he said.</P>



<P>If the defense plans to refer him to the state bar, Darden said they can "take a number" behind all the police officers he has prosecuted for perjury and evidence planting. He also threatened to refer the entire defense team to the U.S. Attorney's office.</P>



<P>In the afternoon, Michele Kestler, LAPD crime lab director, completed her testimony. It was the first testimony the jury had heard since Monday.</P>



<P>Defense lawyer Peter Neufeld, who had asked to have Kestler declared a hostile witness in the morning, continued his attack of the labs collection methods and the possibility of contamination.</P>



<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>

<P><B>AUGUST 17</B> - The jury will pay a nighttime visit to the scene where O.J. Simpson allegedly killed his ex-wife and Ronald Goldman.</P>



<P>Ruling in favor of the prosecution, Judge Lance Ito ordered a Sunday evening trip over the objections of defense lawyer Carl Douglas who said the lighting, foliage and weather are different now than they were on June 12, 1994, the night of the killings.</P>



<P>The jury has already been to the crime scene and O.J. Simpson's home, and it has viewed numerous pictures of those locations, Douglas said. He also complained of the cost Los Angeles would have to pay for the visit.</P>



<P>But prosecutor Bill Hodgman convinced the judge that a nighttime trip would be "illuminating" and that the conditions as they existed can be replicated.</P>



<P>Judge Ito and lawyers will perform a "dry run" before the jury viewing, to check for changes in the landscaping and lighting at the crime scene. From there, the tour will proceed a few miles away to O.J. Simpson's house.</P>



<P>Should changes in conditions, including the height of certain foliage, be impossible to replicate, Judge Ito indicated he would cancel the viewing.</P>



<P>The court session ended at 2pm when the defense said it had to wait on Judge Ito's ruling on the Fuhrman tapes before calling witnesses pertaining to that issue.</P>



<P>Earlier, Gilbert Aguilar, a finger print specialist with the Los Angeles Police Department, testified that he examined 17 crime scene prints and none of them belonged to Simpson.</P>



<P>Twelve of the prints were identified to no one. Nine of these were capable of identification and three were unidentifiable, Aguilar said.</P>



<P>Defense lawyer Johnnie Cochran Jr. used this testimony to suggest that Simpson was not at the crime scene and that unidentified prints point to the possibility of a unknown killer.</P>



<P>Prosecutor Christopher Darden tried to show the irrelevance of Aguilar's testimony by suggesting that anyone from a babysitter to a window washer could have left the unidentified finger prints.</P>



<P>Anguilar also testified that he did not compare any of the 17 prints to Simpson's children and other family members, nor was he aware if a maid, groundskeeper or babysitter worked at Nicole Brown's house.</P>



<P>Prints are hard to lift off of stucco, concrete, cloth or human skin, and they might not be left by a person wearing leather gloves, Aguilar said.</P>



<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>

<P><B>AUGUST 18</B> - Judge Lance Ito canceled plans for a second jury visit to the crime scene and O.J. Simpson's house after prosecutors abruptly withdrew their request for the tour.</P>



<P>"After the lawyers have reviewed all of the conditions out here, the lawyers for the prosecution are not convinced that the conditions are substantially similar," Deputy District Attorney Alan Yochelson said Friday night.</P>



<P>The jury's planned Sunday night visit was called off after an entourage of about 20 people involved with the case visited the Brentwood scene where the slashed bodies of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman were found.</P>



<P>Simpson's lawyers had strongly opposed the field trip, contending that jurors would only be confused because the lighting and foliage had changed.</P>



<P>Prosecutors had argued that it was the only way to give a true sense of how the murders were committed and had even asked to have a man and a woman pose as murder victims lying on the pavement -- an idea the judge rejected. The jury's first visit to the crime scene took place in daylight last February.</P>



<P>Meanwhile, Judge John Reid ruled that Judge Ito's wife, Los Angeles Police Captain Margaret York, could not be called as a witness. Had she been called, the judge would have had to disqualify himself as the trial judge, raising the possibility of a long delay. York was once the supervisor of detective Mark Fuhrman and reportedly is the subject of insulting remarks made on the tapes by Fuhrman.</P>

<H2>Week by Week in the O.J. Simpson Criminal Trial</H2>



<H3>Week 31 (August 21-25, 1995)</H3>



<P><B>AUGUST 21</B> - Judge Lance Ito temporarily rejected the defense's bid to introduce the taped interviews of police detective Mark Fuhrman as "incoherent" and chided their mistakes.</P>



<P>"Given the fact there are more than a dozen attorneys working for the defense, it is not too much to ask that there be some basic correlation between the quoted proffer, the purported transcript and the audio tapes," Judge Ito wrote in his ruling. "The proffer is incoherent and will not be considered in its current form."</P>



<P>The defense promised a corrected version would be filed by Tuesday morning and blamed errors in page citation on the difficulty of reconciling different transcriptions of the tapes.</P>



<P>In his ruling, Judge Ito listed several examples of attempts he made to cross- reference reported incidents of racial epithets and police misconduct on the tapes with quotes in the transcripts. He said he gave up after several hours of hard work and frustration over the weekend.</P>



<P>There were ten incidents of Fuhrman using racial epithets and discussing police misconduct from the defense's motion listed in Judge Ito's ruling. These include:</P>



<UL TYPE=DISC>

	<LI>"That we've got females . .. and dumb niggers, and all your Mexicans that can't even write the name of the car they drive."<P>



	<LI>"Where would this country be if every time a sheriff went out with a posse to find somebody who just robbed and killed a bunch of people, he stopped and talked to them first."

</UL>



<P>Prosecutor Marcia Clark said that none of the ten items were on the audio tapes. Apparently author Laura Hart McKinney, who conducted the interviews and made some transcriptions, recorded over some of the tapes.</P>



<P>Defense lawyer Johnnie Cochran Jr. called this a "non-issue," because 20 of the 30 times Fuhrman calls blacks "niggers" and many references to police misconduct are still on tape.</P>



<P>In the afternoon, Larry Ragle, the former director of the Orange County Sheriff Department's crime lab, pointed out weaknesses in the investigation of the Simpson case, calling it "below minimum standard."</P>



<P>Ragle criticized the Los Angeles Police Department for how they collected, handled and secured evidence. He said it was a mistake to cover Nicole Brown's body with a blanket from inside her home and then not to collect the blanket to examine it for evidence.</P>



<P>Critical evidence may have been lost because the coroner's office didn't show up at the crime scene for ten hours and the police erred by moving the bodies improperly, he said.</P>



<P>Prosecutor Hank Goldberg brought out in cross-examination that Ragle is not a detective and has never been a primary criminalist. Ragle admitted that he has not read many of the leading books on forensic criminology that would be on most criminalists' bookshelves.</P>



<P>While Ragle criticized the LAPD handling of evidence, Goldberg pointed out that Ragle himself had not worn gloves when he examined the inside of Simpson's Ford Bronco.</P>



<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>

<P><B>AUGUST 22</B> - Dr. Henry Lee, a crime reconstruction expert, said he discovered shoe imprints on a piece of paper and an envelope near the murder scene and found they could not have come from the designer Italian shoes the prosecution claims O.J. Simpson wore the night he killed his ex-wife and Ronald Goldman.</P>



<P>Reinforcing the defense's theory that the Los Angeles Police Department botched the investigation, Dr. Lee testified that he visited Nicole Brown Simpson's home 13 days after she was murdered and recovered the piece of paper and envelope that police neglected to find.</P>



<P>Defense lawyer Barry Scheck led Dr. Lee through testimony that suggested the possibility of a second attacker at the crime scene or that police traipsed through the crime scene.</P>



<P>Dr. Lee, the chief criminalist in Connecticut, manages a lab consisting of 36 forensic scientists who work in 14 different forensic areas. He has helped investigate the suicide of White House deputy counsel Vincent Foster and has worked on the William Kennedy Smith rape trial along with other famous cases, testifying for the prosecution 95% of the time.</P>



<P>While Dr. Lee examined the crime scene, photos and key evidence, he did not review any of the DNA tests.</P>



<P>In earlier testimony Tuesday, Christian Reichardt testified that Simpson seemed upset and depressed at times over his breakup with Nicole Brown Simpson in the weeks before her murder, but appeared relaxed and happy in a telephone call the night she was killed.</P>



<P>Reichardt, a chiropractor and former boyfriend of Faye Resnick, said Simpson and his ex-wife had a rocky, on-again-off-again relationship in the 18 months Reichardt knew them.</P>



<P>Reichardt testified that Simpson called him around 9pm on June 12, 1994, and they spoke for about 15 minutes.</P>



<P>Reichardt said Simpson was packing his bag for Chicago while they were on the phone, and they made plans to have dinner later that week after Simpson returned to Los Angeles.</P>



<P>The judge had barred Reichardt from testifying about what the defense originally wanted to elicit from him: that Resnick had a terrible drug problem and stayed for a time with Ms. Simpson before the murders. The defense has suggested drug hitmen committed the killings, possibly to send a message to Resnick for failing to pay her drug bills.</P>



<P>In the morning, Judge Lance Ito accused lawyers of pandering to the courtroom cameras and threatened "to pull the plug" on TV coverage.</P>



<P>He made the statements after hearing arguments between defense lawyer Robert Blasier and prosecutor Marcia Clark. The incident began when Blasier asked permission to recall Orange County criminalist Larry Ragle back to the stand to describe an incident with police detective Philip Vannatter Monday.</P>



<P>Blasier said that after Ragle finished testifying, Ragle approached Vannatter to shake hands. Blasier said Vannatter refused and called him a "traitor."</P>



<P>Blasier said Vannatter's statement is evidence of a "habit or custom" of police officers not testifying against each other.</P>



<P>Clark called the defense request "ridiculous" and "absurd," arguing that Vannatter is entitled to an opinion and can say whatever he pleases to a witness who is finished testifying.</P>



<P>After admonishing both lawyers, Judge Ito held that the testimony has "minimal" value and would unnecessarily lengthen the trial.</P>



<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>

<P><B>AUGUST 23</B> - The defense raised questions about a fundamental premise of the state's case -- that one killer was responsible for the deaths of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman.</P>



<P>Dr. Henry Lee testified that he saw "partial parallel line imprint patterns," in Goldman's blood-soaked jeans and in the soil. He quickly admitted that he could not say for sure that the patterns were footprints, but said they were consistent with imprints he identified Tuesday as shoe prints.</P>



<P>Although Lee could not positively identify the prints on Goldman's jeans as shoe prints, he said they were not consistent with the Bruno Magli shoe prints found at the murder scene -- prints the prosecution says belong to Simpson. In addition, Lee said the prints were not consistent with Goldman's tennis shoes.</P>



<P>Seemingly, the prints could only be shoe prints like the one Lee said he saw on the Bundy walkway. But, prosecutors are expected to attack Lee on the fact that he can't say for sure and to paint his observations as speculative.</P>



<P>Lee's testimony also buttressed defense claims that someone planted blood on the socks found in Simpson's bedroom. Lee testified that when he held the socks up to the light, he could see blood stains. Police officers previously testified that they did not initially see blood when they collected the socks.</P>



<P>Lee also said he agreed with blood spatter expert Herbert MacDonell's claim that on the inner surface of one side of the sock he saw evidence indicated that the blood soaked through from the outer surface of the opposite side. This suggests that the blood soaked through while no one was wearing the sock.</P>



<P>Defense attorney Barry Scheck also used Lee's testimony to cast some doubt on the time of the murders. The prosecution has held fast to a timeframe that the murders were committed between 10:15 pm and 10:20 pm. But Lee suggested evidence that will allow the defense to argue that a struggle between Goldman and his assailant would push the time of the murders closer to 11 pm, when Simpson has an alibi..</P>



<P>Lee pointed out a gash in the heel of Goldman's shoe and concluded that the position of the cut suggests the shoe was in the air -- perhaps in a kicking motion -- when it was slashed. He said Goldman's beeper and keys were found in two different locations, suggesting he was in one place and then another. And Lee noted there were multiple blood patterns -- smears, drips, squirts and spatters, on the fence near where Goldman's body was found. The defense will likely argue that Goldman tried to fend off his attacker for an extended period of time. The prosecution has argued the killings took just minutes.</P>



<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>

<P><B>AUGUST 24</B> - The court was in recess.</P>



<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>

<P><B>AUGUST 25</B> - Forensics expert Dr. Henry Lee testified there was "something wrong" in the handling of incriminating blood evidence collected at the crime scene.</P>



<P>Lee said he found transfer stains inside paper packaging holding what were supposed to be dry blood samples.</P>



<P>"Something, somebody . . . put the swatch in the (package to) cause such a transfer. Who did it? What happened? I don't know," said Lee, the defense's key forensics expert. "Only opinion I can give you under these circumstances: Something's wrong."</P>



<P>The defense is expected to argue that the evidence was tampered with, possibly in the Los Angeles Police Department's crime lab. Prosecutors have suggested the possibility that the freezing and unfreezing of swatches could have created the moisture leading to the transfers.</P>



<P>Lee's testimony focused on his observations to the bindle of swatches made from the Bundy walkway blood stain. The swatches had been placed into a test tube the night of June 13, 1994 while in the police department crime lab. The next morning they were removed and placed onto paper to make up a "bindle." Lee testified that he saw four blood transfer stains on the paper, leading him to be confused on two points. Lee believed that all swatches would have been dry, thereby leaving no stains. In the alternative, if they had been wet, there should have been seven stains.</P>



<P>In completing his fourth day on the witness stand, Lee was guided through questions that pressed defense theories.</P>



<P>In one instance, the 57-year-old director of the Connecticut State Forensics Science Laboratory testified that bloodstains on the console of Simpson's Ford Bronco were consistent with a smearing motion. Defense attorneys have suggested that those stains were planted.</P>



<P>Lee also found smearing on the inside and outside of a bag that contained Ronald Goldman's shoes. Defense attorney Barry Scheck suggested it indicated the type of sloppy handling that could cause cross-contamination and unreliable blood analysis.</P>



<P>Lee also testified that he found three additional bloodstains on the foyer of Simpson's Rockingham home. He agreed that the size and pattern of the stains are consistent with blood cast off from a superficial cut on the inside of a finger.</P>

<H2>Week by Week in the O.J. Simpson Criminal Trial</H2>



<H3>Week 32 (August 28 - September 1, 1995)</H3>



<P><B>AUGUST 28</B> - Prosecutors tried to minimize the impact of the testimony of Dr. Henry Lee, whose testimony solidified several aspects of the defense theory of the case.</P>



<P>Lee conceded that he was unable to determine with certainty whether some of the imprint patterns he observed were actually footprints.</P>



<P>After Prosecutor Hank Goldberg showed a videotape of policemen walking through the walkway at Nicole Brown Simpson's home on June 13, 1994, Lee conceded that two police officers' shoes could not be eliminated as the source of suspicious prints at the murder scene. But the witness said it was an unlikely scenario.</P>



<P>"I don't think these two officers deposited these shoe prints," Lee said of marks on the bloodstained tiles. "I don't think their shoes are parallel design." But when asked if he could eliminate the chance that the officers deposited some imprints, Lee said, "I cannot eliminate."</P>



<P>Lee told jurors earlier that he examined photos taken by police but also went to the crime scene two weeks after the killings and did his own investigating. He said that was when he discovered extra "imprints" with a parallel design on the walkway that could be consistent with shoes.</P>



<P>Using a giant magnifying glass to look at photos, Lee showed jurors the extra imprints. Prosecution experts saw only one set of prints from a Bruno Magli shoe that prosecutors have tried to link to Simpson.</P>



<P>Lee's imprint testimony is crucial to the defense hypothesis that more than one attacker was involved in the murders. Lee also has told jurors he saw extra imprints in police pictures of Ronald Goldman's jeans, a bloodstained envelope and a piece of paper found near the bodies.</P>



<P>On re-direct examination, defense attorney Barry Scheck pointed out that the envelope, paper and jeans all were collected by police on June 13. Lee testified that the prints he saw on the items could not have been made by police officers who walked on the Bundy walkway afterwards.</P>



<P>In other testimony, Lee conceded that his laboratory uses a type of DNA testing that another defense scientist challenged as unreliable.</P>



<P>At another point in his testimony, Lee appeared to contradict another defense expert by testifying that he uses the DNA analysis test known as PCR in his crime lab. Microbiologist John Gerdes previously testified that PCR works well in sterile environments but could falter with evidence collected at messy crime scenes.</P>



<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>

<P><B>AUGUST 29</B> - The court was transformed into a forum for the ravings of a racist police officer as Judge Lance Ito allowed the world to hear portions of the Fuhrman tapes.</P>



<P>The judge said he had a duty to the public to allow the tapes to be played in open court outside the presence of the jury. Even though Judge Ito privately had heard the tapes and read the transcripts, he allowed the defense to play them because he said he did not want anyone to ever suspect him of participating in a cover-up.</P>



<P>The decision infuriated the family of victim Ronald Goldman. During an emotional press conference, Fred Goldman said the tapes had no business at the trial which is supposed to determine whether O.J. Simpson killed his son and Nicole Brown Simpson.</P>



<P>"There was no reason to have two hours of this hate to be spewed out over the public airwaves," Goldman said. "My son, Nicole and her family have a right to a fair trial and this is not fair."</P>



<P>The day began with Laura Hart McKinny testifying about her many conversations with Fuhrman since 1985. She described how Fuhrman approached her in a Los Angeles coffee shop a decade ago, ostensibly to discuss her laptop computer. Fuhrman told her about his membership in Men Against Women, a group of policemen opposed to women in the force. The defense then played sickening quote after quote of Fuhrman uttering the word nigger 41 times and boasting of police brutality and other misconduct.</P>



<P>The chilling passages included:</P>



<P>"Do you people, don't you shoot to wound them? No, we shoot to kill em. Now the department says we shoot to stop, not kill, which is horseshit. The only way we can stop somebody is to kill the son of a bitch. And what's the big deal? If you've got reason to shoot somebody, you've got reason to kill him."</P>



<P>"No, if I would have arrested the son of a bitch, I would have killed him. If I ever see the son of a bitch and we're alone, I would kill him...If there's nobody except him and me, dead men tell no tales. See, he killed two policemen. I have an obligation if I ever have the opportunity, I should kill him. And that's all there is to it."</P>



<P>Perhaps the most devastating passages could be Fuhrman's bragging about manufacturing probable cause to arrest someone. "I didn't arrest him under anything, just took him to the station, ran him for prints, gave them to the detectives to compare with what they've got in the area. I'll probably arrest a criminal that way...I'd be able to correlate exactly what I said into a reasonable probable cause for arrest."</P>



<P>The quote could prove devasting to the prosecution because it was Fuhrman who found probable cause -- the blood stains on O.J. Simpson's Bronco -- that convinced police to jump the wall onto his Rockingham estate.</P>



<P>If it can be determined that Fuhrman has a pattern of fabricating probable cause, and if the defense can show there is evidence he made have done so in this case, the defense could seek to have all the evidence found by Fuhrman thrown out of the case.</P>



<P>Under cross-examination by Prosecutor Christopher Darden, McKinny admitted she had told Fuhrman that she was interested in a very dramatic screenplay with a lot of violence. The prosecution has argued that much of what Fuhrman said was in the context of creating a piece of fiction.</P>



<P>McKinny also told Darden that said she had not produced the tapes earlier in order to protect her sources and because she considered them to have minimal evidentiary value.</P>



<P>"The information on the tapes does not directly exonerate Mr. Simpson, and therefore I didn't have the responsibility to come forth with the information," she testified. Later, she added: "There was nothing to me that made me feel that Officer Fuhrman could have planted evidence in this particular case, no."</P>



<P>But Judge Ito then asked McKinny a crucial question: "Was there a subplot to her screenplay regarding racial conflict with officers?" McKinny said no, it was about women in the Los Angeles police department.</P>



<P>As a result, the judge might be suspicious of all the racial slurs and boasting of police misconduct if it was not needed for the screenplay.</P>



<P>In arguing for the admissibility of the tapes, attorney Gerald Uelmen said the defense was not trying to inflame the passions of the jury but simply trying to challenge Fuhrman's credibility and to help the jury assess the weight they should give to his testimony. Uelmen complained that the jury only has seen a polished and professional performance by Fuhrman on the witness stand.</P>



<P>Secondly, the defense wants to use the tapes to show racial bias, which, Uelmen said, goes directly to his credibility. California case law says expressions of racial hostility are questions of credibility for the jury to resolve.</P>



<P>Uelmen then argued that the tapes corroborate the statements of Kathleen Bell, who is expected to testify that she heard Fuhrman used the word nigger and say that black people should be rounded up and burned.</P>



<P>Lead Prosecutor Marcia Clark began her argument by saying it was probably the toughest thing she had ever been called upon to do as a prosecutor. As a citizen, she said, she was offended, shocked and disgusted, and wanted the tapes disclosed to the public, but as a prosecutor she had to argue that the tapes had no place in the murder case.</P>



<P>"This is a murder trial where none of this is relevant," she said. She also said that Fuhrman was peripheral to her case given the mass of evidence pointing to Simpson's guilt. "The admission of this evidence is telling the jury: 'Disregard the case. Look somewhere else,' " she said.</P>



<P>Clark argued the defense has not presented any evidence to prove Fuhrman planted the bloody glove or any other evidence in the case. She said if he had the opportunity to plant anything, he would have been foolish to try, not knowing whether there were eyewitnesses to the crime or whether Simpson had an alibi.</P>



<P>After a quick huddle with the rest of the defense lawyers, Uelmen countered that the basis of Clark's argument -- what the facts are in the case. He argued that there are no facts in the case -- as least not yet. The facts are to determined by the jury, and if he were to present the defense closing argument today, Uelmen said, he would dispute any and every issue that Clark referred to as fact.</P>



<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>

<P><B>AUGUST 30</B> - The court is in recess while Judge Lance Ito contemplated a ruling on the admissibility of the Fuhrman tapes.</P>



<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>

<P><B>AUGUST 31</B> - Judge Lance Ito ruled that jurors could hear only 2 of the 41 tape-recorded instances in which Detective Mark Fuhrman referred to blacks as "niggers."</P>



<P>And, in another setback for O.J. Simpson's lawyers, the judge barred the defense from offering any of Fuhrman's explosive statements about police misconduct, mostly on grounds that the statements are too inflammatory to be worthwhile and that the defense failed to prove the incidents actually happened.</P>



<P>These are the two relatively innocuous taped statements the jury will hear:</P>



<P>"We have no niggers where I grew up."</P>



<P>The second is a question and answer:</P>



<P>"Why do they live in that area?" McKinny asks.</P>



<P>"That's where niggers live," Fuhrman responds.</P>



<P>Judge Ito ruled that the defense can have North Carolina professor and screenwriter Laura Hart McKinny, who recorded the tapes for a screenplay project, testify that Fuhrman used the word "nigger" in a disparaging manner 41 times during the interviews.</P>



<P>But in rejecting the playing of the 39 other examples offered by the defense, the judge wrote: "The court finds the probative value of the remaining examples to be substantially and overwhelmingly outweighed by the danger of undue prejudice."</P>



<P>The judge said, however, that the jury should hear evidence that speaks to Fuhrman's credibility as a witness. During his testimony, Fuhrman said he had not used the word nigger in the past 10 years.</P>



<P>"Just as a defendant with prior felony convictions testifying before a jury is not entitled to a false aura of credibility, neither is Fuhrman," Judge Ito wrote in a 10-page ruling.</P>



<P>"The specific racial epithet at issue is perhaps the single most insulting, inflammatory and provocative term in use in modern day America. The court's examination of each of these 41 uses reveals not only the racial epithet itself, but a context that only adds to the insulting and inflammatory nature," he wrote.</P>



<P>In his ruling on the police misconduct comments, the judge attacked the defense theory that Fuhrman moved a glove from the murder scene to Simpson's house to frame Simpson for the slayings of his ex-wife and her friend.</P>



<P>The judge said that the only evidence the defense has to support this theory is an assertion by Rosa Lopez, the maid of Simpson's neighbor, that she gave information favorable to Simpson to Fuhrman but Fuhrman never passed that information along.</P>



<P>"This assertion [of glove planting] is not supported by the record," the judge wrote. "The underlying assumption requires a leap in both law and logic that is too broad to be made based upon the evidence before the jury. It is a theory without factual support."</P>



<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>

<P><B>SEPTEMBER 1</B> - The defense shifted strategy in light of Judge Lance Ito's ruling on the Mark Fuhrman tapes.</P>



<P>Instead of attacking Fuhrman's credibility with two excerpts from taped interviews with Laura Hart McKinny, the defense did not call the screenwriter and professor to the witness stand. Instead, defense attorneys announced plans to call a half-dozen other witnesses to attack Fuhrman's character.</P>



<P>The defense also spent time challenging Judge Lance Ito's ruling on the tapes. At one point, defense attorney Johnnie Cochran Jr. called it "incoherent" - the same word the judge had used to describe the defense's initial motion to introduce the tapes.</P>



<P>Cochran complained that two excerpts including the word "nigger" and allowed by Judge Ito - one of which can be heard on the tapes, the other included in a transcript - misrepresented Fuhrman's character to the jury.</P>



<P>"You picked instances where it doesn't allow us to show what he has done as it relates to this case," said Cochran. "Perhaps never in the history of criminal jurisprudence has there been this level of impeachment out of somebody's mouth."</P>



<P>Cochran vowed to file a motion asking the judge to reconsider his ruling.</P>



<P>"I expect that," the judge told Cochran. "You also could walk down the street a block and a half to the Court of Appeals if you don't like the ruling."</P>



<P>The judge did grant the defense the opportunity to call witnesses out of order. But because of the short court day, and a last- minute change in tactics, no testimony was heard.</P>



<P>Simpson's lawyers said witnesses they planned to call would tell of Fuhrman's use of the racial epithet derogatory to African-Americans, his propensity to falsify evidence and his disdain for interracial couples.  The defense even wants to call a psychiatrist who attorney F. Lee Bailey contends "conditioned" Fuhrman, perhaps medicating him, for cross- examination in March. Fuhrman has testified that he did not know the man.</P>

<H2>Week by Week in the O.J. Simpson Criminal Trial</H2>



<H3>Week 33 (September 5 - 8, 1995)</H3>



<P><B>SEPTEMBER 5</B> - After a week of waiting while lawyers argued over the admissibility of the Fuhrman tapes, the O.J. Simpson jurors returned to the courtroom and listened to witnesses tell stories of the former police detective's racist ranting.</P>



<P>Jurors also heard a tape recording of Mark Fuhrman's interview with professor and screenwriter Laura McKinny. Speaking on the subject of the effectiveness of female police officers, Fuhrman said, "They don't do anything. They don't go out and initiate contact with some 6'5" nigger that's been in prison for seven years pumping weights."</P>



<P>This testimony came nearly six months after Fuhrman told the court how he scaled the fence at Simpson's home and found a bloody glove. At that time, Fuhrman denied being a racist, planting evidence to incriminate African Americans, or using what has come to be known in the trial as "The N-word." In addition, Fuhrman said that anyone who told the court that he used that word is a liar.</P>



<P>The first defense witness, Kathleen Bell, testified that she met Fuhrman at a Marine recruiting center in 1985 or 1986, found him handsome, and wanted to set him up on a date with her friend, Andrea Terry.</P>



<P>At one point, Fuhrman told Bell that when he sees a black man driving with a white woman he pulls over the car. Bell said she asked him if he needed a reason. "He said he'd find something. I asked what if they're in love? He said, 'That's disgusting.'" she testified.</P>



<P>In the same conversation, she testified that Fuhrman said, "If I had my way, I'd gather all the niggers together and burn them."</P>



<P>Bell said she called the Los Angeles Police Department after the meeting to report Fuhrman, but could only recall his first name. She said she did not ask for his last name at the recruiting station because she was scared of him.</P>



<P>Bell said she wrote to defense lawyer Johnnie Cochran, Jr. after seeing Fuhrman testify at the preliminary hearing.</P>



<P>Prosecutor Christopher Darden limited his cross-examination and didn't question the veracity of Bell's statements. He only suggested that despite those racist statements, Bell introduced Fuhrman to her friend, a claim Bell denied.</P>



<P>Possibly wary of opening the door for the defense to use more of the Fuhrman tapes, the prosecution was careful in attacking the credibility of witnesses on the race issue.</P>



<P>A second witness, Natalie Singer, testified that Fuhrman's partner Tom Vitrano dated her roommate in 1987, and the officers were frequent guests in her Beverly Hills apartment. She quoted Fuhrman as saying, "The only good nigger is a dead nigger." At a later date, she kicked Fuhrman out of the house for calling her a "fucking bitch." She next saw him several years later testifying against Simpson, prompting her to call the defense.</P>



<P>On cross-examination, prosecutor Marcia Clark tried only to establish that Singer was not as angered by Fuhrman's words as she appeared to be.</P>



<P>Late in the day, McKinny took the stand and described how Fuhrman agreed to work with her in 1985 on her screenplay about women in law enforcement. She said she told Fuhrman to be honest about his opinions and as factual as possible.</P>



<P>Though her plot dealt with sexism, not racism, she said Fuhrman used the "N-word" about 41 times in interviews over the past ten years while describing his experiences as a police officer.</P>



<P>In addition to one taped segment played aloud, jurors were allowed to read a transcript of Fuhrman saying, "We have no niggers where I grew up." The recording of this statement, one of the two that Judge Lance Ito ruled could be played for the jury, was found to be barely audible.</P>



<P>Before McKinny took the stand, the defense called William Blasini, Jr., who said he visited Viertel's, the tow yard where O.J. Simpson's Ford Bronco was held, and saw no blood on the console. He said he went to the yard to bid on some cars and that the manager, Bob Jones, let him look around. He said he found the Bronco doors unlocked, which supports the defense contention that the police had the opportunity to plant evidence.</P>



<P>On cross-examination, prosecutor Clark established that Blasini was a frequent bidder at the yard and that because he had a long relationship with Jones, it was not unusual for him to be left alone to look at the cars.</P>



<P>Blasini continued to insist that there was no blood on the Bronco console, even after Clark introduced blown-up photos of blood stains in the Bronco taken a week before Blasini's visit.</P>



<P>Clark also got Blasini to admit that he wears tinted glasses because he has trouble seeing in fluorescent light, which is how Vertel's is lit.</P>



<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>

<P><B>SEPTEMBER 6</B> - Former detective Mark Fuhrman returned to the witness stand and invoked the Fifth Amendment when asked whether he lied or planted evidence or filed false reports in the O.J. Simpson investigation.</P>



<P>Fuhrman, who previously testified to finding a bloody glove on Simpson's estate the day after the murders, refused to answer a series of questions from defense attorney Gerald Uelmen.</P>



<P>Among them were: "Was the testimony that you gave in the preliminary hearing in this case completely truthful?" "Have you ever falsified a police report?" and "Did you plant or manufacture any evidence in this case?"</P>



<P>In each instance, Fuhrman turned to his lawyer, Darryl Mounger, then declared, "I wish to assert my Fifth Amendment privilege."</P>



<P>The brief exchange, outside the presence of the jury, came during a hearing in which the defense asked Judge Lance Ito to suppress all the evidence gathered at Simpson's estate from the point when Fuhrman said he found blood on Simpson's car several hours after the murders.</P>



<P>Uelmen asked the judge to exercise his independent judgment on the issue of Fuhrman's credibility vis-a-vis finding blood on the Bronco. He argued that Judge Ito should place no faith in Fuhrman's reasoning for conducting the warrantless search of Simpson's home.</P>



<P>Uelmen argued that the Fuhrman tapes reveal the former police officer's inclination to create whatever facts are necessary to arrest someone and to lie in order to justify an improper search. This suggests, Uelmen argued, that Fuhrman's testimony regarding the Bronco blood spot was suspect.</P>



<P>Finally, Uelmen argued that in order for Judge Ito to assess Fuhrman's credibility accurately, the judge should allow the defense to cross-examine Fuhrman on his statements to professor and screenwriter Laura McKinny.</P>



<P>Prosecutor Cheri Lewis argued that Judge Ito does not have to decide whether he himself believes Fuhrman's preliminary hearing testimony. Instead, she argued, the judge only must consider whether the Fuhrman tapes would have affected Judge Kathleen Kennedy-Powell's decision not to suppress the evidence during the preliminary hearing.</P>



<P>In the end, Judge Ito reserved ruling on the suppression issues but allowed Fuhrman to take the witness stand.</P>



<P>In earlier testimony Wednesday, the defense lawyers offered more details of Fuhrman's racial bigotry.</P>



<P>First, McKinny completed her testimony. Prosecutor Christopher Darden suggested McKinny was being less than truthful about whether she had tried to sell the explosive "Fuhrman tapes." But she insisted: "They are not for sale."</P>



<P>At one point during a discussion of the so-called "N" word, McKinny, who teaches screenwriting at a North Carolina college, asked Darden: "Why are we having this adversarial relationship? The word is vile, why try to make it worse?"</P>



<P>Later in his cross-examination, Darden asked McKinny why she had used the word in a screenplay developed from the tapes if she found it vile.</P>



<P>"Because it is reflective of particular officers', or officer's, dialogue, feelings at a particular time. It would be representative of what would be said," she replied.</P>



<P>Darden produced a four-page document prepared by two entertainment lawyers representing McKinny that he said was an attempt to sell the tapes for $500,000. She said the document was prepared to ascertain the value of the tapes, which she had no intention of selling.</P>



<P>She needed to know the value, she said, for other reasons. "I have had a great deal of the material leaked (to the media) and that's an aspect I would be considering," she said.</P>



<P>She was also asked if her relationship with Fuhrman was purely professional. "It was a business relationship," she told the jury.</P>



<P>She was followed by Roderic Hodge, a black man who said that when Fuhrman arrested him in 1987, he declared: "I told you we'd get you, nigger."</P>



<P>On cross-examination, Hodge told Darden that he filed a complaint about the incident with the police department. Darden then showed him a copy of the complaint, which did not mention Fuhrman's use of the word nigger. On re-direct, Hodge testified there was no doubt that Fuhrman referred to him as a nigger.</P>



<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>

<P><B>SEPTEMBER 7</B> - Judge Lance Ito rejected the defense's attempt to force former detective Mark Fuhrman to testify again before the jury. But the judge angered prosecutors by ruling that he would tell jurors that Fuhrman was not available for further testimony and that they may consider his unavailability in evaluating his credibility as witness.</P>



<P>The judge then halted the proceedings and granted angry prosecutors a chance to appeal the ruling by noon Friday. The jury was then dismissed until Friday when the defense is expected to rest its case.</P>



<P>In his ruling, Judge Ito conceded that Simpson was prejudiced by the fact that Fuhrman was not cross-examined about defense witnesses Natalie Singer, Roderic Hodge and Laura McKinny. But, he said, California case law clearly states that it's inappropriate to present to the jury a witness whom the lawyers know will invoke the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.</P>



<P>The defense had argued that the California cases dealing with the issue do not address the situation in which a witness invokes the Fifth Amendment privilege after having testified. Fuhrman, the defense contended, voluntarily took the witness stand and therefore should have to stay there and answer whatever questions come his way.</P>



<P>Although the prosecution was angered by the judge's ruling, the defense did not get exactly what it wanted. Defense lawyer Gerald Ulemen had asked Judge Ito to consider three remedies, none of which were specifically granted. The defense options were: let the jury hear Fuhrman invoke the Fifth Amendment or be read the transcript of Wednesday when he took the Fifth outside the presence of the jury; give the jury a special instruction explaining that Fuhrman took the Fifth Amendment and what it meant; admit portions of the Fuhrman tapes that describe the former detective manufacturing evidence.</P>



<P>In another ruling, Judge Ito refused to throw out a bloody glove and other prosecution evidence, ruling that Fuhrman's explanation for entering Simpson's estate without a warrant can still be trusted.</P>



<P>In a two-page ruling, the judge said the recently-discovered Fuhrman tapes didn't require the reversal of earlier decisions that admitted evidence found by Fuhrman and other detectives who entered Simpson's estate without a warrant several hours after the murders. The detectives scaled a fence onto Simpson's property after Fuhrman noticed a blood spot on Simpson's Ford Bronco.</P>



<P>The defense had argued the Fuhrman tapes cast doubt on whether Fuhrman was telling the truth about his justification for the warrantless entry. But the judge said Fuhrman's credibility remained intact.</P>



<P>"The testimony of Fuhrman . . . is corroborated by the testimony of other witnesses," the judge wrote.</P>



<P>Meanwhile, defense attorney F. Lee Bailey confirmed that Simpson will not testify in his own defense.</P>



<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>

<P><B>SEPTEMBER 8</B> - A California appeals court rejected Judge Lance Ito's proposed jury instruction on Mark Fuhrman. The judge had wanted to tell the jury that the former detective was unavailable for further testimony and the panel could consider his unavailability in assessing his credibility as a witness.</P>



<P>In its order, the court said, "Pending further order of this court, the proposed instruction regarding the unavailability of Detective (Mark) Fuhrman is not to be given."</P>



<P>The appeals court said Judge Ito could submit arguments to that court Monday if he wished fight the ruling, but in the meantime he was "ordered not to stay (delay) any other proceedings in this case." The judge decided to comply with the order and voided his instruction.</P>



<P>Fuhrman, who testified earlier to finding the infamous bloody glove on Simpson's estate the morning after the murders, invoked his constitutional right against self-incrimination Wednesday to avoid being cross-examined by the defense over the racial epithet "nigger" which he was heard uttering 42 times in tape recorded conversations with a screenwriter.</P>



<P>Fuhrman had previously sworn on oath that he had never used the racial epithet word in the last 10 years. The audiotape recordings were made between 1985 and 1994.</P>



<P>In the successful writ of appeal, lead prosecutor Marcia Clark wrote that in making the order, Judge Ito had "erred as a matter of law and exceeded his jurisdiction."</P>

<H2>Week by Week in the O.J. Simpson Criminal Trial</H2>



<H3>Week 34 (September 11 - 15, 1995)</H3>



<P><B>SEPTEMBER 11</B> - The prosecution began presenting its rebuttal case even though the defense has not finished its case.</P>



<P>The first rebuttal witness was a photographer who took a picture of O.J. Simpson in 1990 during a Chicago Bears football game. In that photograph, Simpson is wearing dark gloves that the state contends are the same as the gloves found at the murder scene and at Simpson's home after his ex-wife and her friend were killed.</P>



<P>Judge Lance Ito ordered the prosecution to start its rebuttal case after the defense was left scrambling for final witnesses. Earlier in the day, the judge rejected a number of defense proposals aimed at getting Mark Fuhrman back on the witness stand.</P>



<P>The judge said he would not strike Fuhrman's testimony of how he found a bloody glove on Simpson's estate the morning after the murders. He also turned down a defense request that the jury be instructed to forget the glove had ever been found.</P>



<P>In addition, he said he would not order the prosecution to offer limited immunity to the now-retired detective. The judge also turned down a defense request that he determine which questions Fuhrman could refuse to answer by invoking his right against self-incrimination.</P>



<P>After conferring with defense attorneys during the lunch break, defense attorney Johnnie Cochran Jr. returned to say that the defense decided to ask an appeals court to intervene on the Fuhrman matter.</P>



<P>"We cannot rest at this point," Cochran told the judge.</P>



<P>"These are extraordinary issues," the judge said of the defense's concerns. In a rare but not unprecedented solution, he said he wouldn't force the defense to rest but ordered prosecutors to begin calling rebuttal witnesses immediately.</P>



<P>Deputy District Attorney Marcia Clark objected that this would put her at a disadvantage because the defense could return with witnesses while rebuttal is under way.</P>



<P>"It's time for the court to tell him it's over," Clark argued, referring to Cochran. "This is another filibuster proposed by the defense."</P>



<P>Clark then reluctantly began the state's rebuttal case with a series of photos of a glove-clad Simpson, microphone in hand, doing TV commentary on football games in the early 1990s.</P>



<P>Some of the pictures showed Simpson wearing brown gloves, similar to those that are critical to the case. Other pictures showed him wearing black gloves. Clark said the black gloves showed "a very short and tight fit," which was important in judging how Simpson wore his gloves.</P>



<P>Video clips, although shown without sound, provided a mini-retrospective of Simpson's TV career, showing him doing interviews with Cincinnati Bengals then-coach Sam Wyche and quarterback Boomer Esiason and talking with his former NBC colleagues.</P>



<P>The glove presentation was the prosecution's attempt to erase the impact of an earlier demonstration that failed when Simpson struggled to pull on the evidence gloves and told the jury they were too small. Monday was the first time the jury saw the prosecution photos of Simpson wearing gloves.</P>



<P>Glove expert Richard Rubin was in the courtroom waiting to testify about similarities between the murder gloves and those that Simpson wore on the football field sidelines.</P>



<P>Defense lawyers fought to keep out the pictures, saying that prosecutors had them before they rested their case last July and should not have been allowed to hold them back for dramatic effect until the rebuttal case.</P>



<P>Even though the prosecutors received some of the pictures before resting their case, Judge Ito ruled they had no obligation to introduce them into evidence before they could be analyzed.</P>



<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>

<P><B>SEPTEMBER 12</B> - A glove expert testified that the gloves worn by O.J. Simpson in videotapes of football games were identical to the bloody gloves found at the crime scene and at Simpson's home.</P>



<P>Richard Rubin, a former executive of Aris Isotoner, identified the gloves worn by Simpson during his broadcasting days as extra-large Aris Lights, a model featuring a lighter weight leather and special stitching.</P>



<P>Rubin, testifying for a fourth time in the trial, said that only 300 pairs of the gloves were manufactured, and that between 200 and 240 were sold, in 1990, all of those at Bloomingdale's.</P>



<P>The state contends that Nicole Brown Simpson bought her husband two pairs of Aris gloves -- color and size unspecified by the sales slip -- in December 1990.</P>



<P>But on cross-examination, Rubin conceded that he could not say the gloves from the videotapes were the same as those retrieved from South Bundy Drive and North Rockingham Avenue. Defense attorney Robert Blasier also suggested that Rubin was prejudiced against Simpson. He produced a letter from the witness to prosecutors saying, "Maybe I can make it to the victory party."</P>



<P>Blasier also suggested that Rubin did not try to determine whether similar gloves could have been made elsewhere, such as in Europe.</P>



<P>Meanwhile, Judge Lance Ito again grappled with juror problems after the defense demanded that one juror be dismissed and suggested that the judge end sequestration.</P>



<P>The problems began when the defense revealed that the judge indicated that he might offer a juror financial held to a juror who apparently stands to lose $1,500 a month in rental income from her property because of her long sequestration.</P>



<P>Defense lawyer Robert Shapiro argued the juror should be dismissed because the judge's offer "gives the appearance special treatment is being given." He also suggested that the juror be dismissed if the offer of assistance is withdrawn.</P>



<P>The juror has not been identified, but is one of two white women on the panel. Attention focused immediately on the older and, presumably, wealthier of the two, a 60-year-old retired gas company clerk. Defense lawyers believe she is hostile to Simpson, and charge privately that were a black female juror to face similar financial problems, she would not be similarly accommodated.</P>



<P>Defense attorney Johnnie Cochran then suggested that Judge Ito think about allow the jurors to go home at night. The request prompted a sarcastic reply from Deputy District Attorney Marcia Clark.</P>



<P>"This takes the cake for the most transparent motion ever made the defense," she said, adding the defense wants the jurors to be exposed to the furor over retired detective Mark Fuhrman.</P>



<P>The judge withheld any rulings on the jury.</P>



<P>He did rule on a prosecution request to show the jury a videotaped interview with Thano Peratis, the police nurse who drew blood from Simpson shortly after the killings. Based on a primitive experiment that he performed at home -- re-enacted on his living room couch and shown in court Tuesday -- Peratis said he now believes he removed only 6.5 milliliters of blood, not the 8 milliliters he originally said.</P>



<P>What Peratis called a "goof-up" would account for a missing milliliter of Simpson's blood. Defense lawyers contend that corrupt police officers sprinkled that missing blood around anything incriminating in their conspiracy to frame Simpson. Ito ruled that prosecutors could show Peratis, who is indisposed after heart bypass surgery, making his point, but minus the homemade demonstration.</P>



<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>

<P><B>SEPTEMBER 13</B> - On their third day of rebuttal, prosecutors countered defense attacks on its scientific evidence that placed Ronald Goldman's blood in O.J. Simpson's Ford Bronco.</P>



<P>After Judge Lance Ito overruled defense objections to the introduction of new DNA tests, prosecution witness Gary Sims testified the genetic markers of O.J. Simpson and murder victim Ronald Goldman were found in a bloodstain in Simpson's Bronco.</P>



<P>Sims, a criminalist for the state Department of Justice, testified that the recently arrived results came from the established and mostly accepted form of DNA testing called RFLP. He said to get an RFLP result he had to combine three bloodstains from the console so that there would be enough DNA for the test.</P>



<P>Sims previosuly testified that PCR tests on a stain on the Bronco's console was consistent with Simpson and Goldman's blood. The defense had attacked that testimony, arguing the PCR test was not reliable. And defense witness Dr. John Gerdes criticized Sims interpretation of the PCR results as inaccurate.</P>



<P>"What's the impact of your RFLP results...on Dr. Gerdes' criticism?" asked Deputy District Attorney Rockne Harmon.</P>



<P>"I think they -- the RFLP results -- do tend to undermine that because they do show consistency (with PCR)," said Sims.</P>



<P>On cross-examination, defense attorney Barry Scheck revisited the conspiracy theory. He suggested Goldman's blood was planted in the Bronco and that Simpson's blood was the result of the cut to his finger. Scheck also reminded Sims that the bloodstain, consistent with Simpson and Goldman, was collected August 26, 1994, after the Bronco had been left unprotected since June 14. Scheck got the witness to admit that he didn't know the order in which the blood was deposited on the console.</P>



<P>After Sims' testimony, the prosecution played a videotape in which Thano Peratis, a police department nurse, said he had overestimated the amount of blood he drew from Simpson shortly after the killings. If true, that would mean there was no missing blood for police officers to plant on evidence to incriminate Simpson.</P>



<P>The day's testimony followed an angry exchange between Judge Lance Ito and Deputy District Attorney Marcia Clark .</P>



<P>Prosecutors failed to show up for an early hearing today and the judge fined them $250. When Clark complained that defense attorneys have showed up late to other hearings without a fine, Judge Ito increased the fine to $1,000. Los Angeles District Attorney Gil Garcetti berated Judge Ito at an afternoon press conference, calling his conduct "outrageous, petty and uncalled for." Garcetti said his office would not pay the fine and sent another lawyer to court to appeal it. Judge Ito finally backed down and reinstated the original $250 penalty.</P>



<P>In other developments:</P>



<UL TYPE=DISC>

	<LI>California's 2nd District Court of Appeals denied the defense team's writ of mandate seeking relief on the issue of whether the jury should hear something about why Mark Fuhrman is unavailable for further testimony. The court said the defense can't seek appellate relief in the middle of a trial on issues dealing with the exclusion of evidence. Such issues, the court ruled, only can be reviewed on appeal after a conviction.<P>



	There are "very limited circumstances" for which a mid-trial appeal would be granted, the court ruled., "Those very narrow circumstances involve a unique situation where the rights to counsel and to present a defense are at issue. No such unique circumstances are present in this case."<P>



	<LI>The defense confirmed reports it wants to call FBI agent Frederic Whitehurst, who claimed he was pressured to change his testimony to favor the prosecution in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. The Simpson defense apparently expects Whitehurst, who used to work with Special Agent Roger Martz in the toxicology lab, to testify that federal agents typically slant their testimony in favor of prosecutors.  Martz testified in July that blood on a sock from Simpson's bedroom and from the crime scene showed only vague signs of a preservative, which, he said, could have come from any number of sources. The defense maintained the blood was planted and said the presence of the preservative proved it.<P>



	<LI>Judge Ito rejected a defense motion to un-sequester the jury.

</UL>



<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>

<P><B>SEPTEMBER 14</B> - Two FBI agents retook the witness stand to refute the defense contention that police investigators failed to find bloody footprints of a second assailant at the murder scene.</P>



<P>Special agents Douglas Deedrick and William Bodziak, who testified in mid-June and early July, were recalled to counter the testimony of defense expert witness Dr. Henry Lee, who identified imprints on Ronald Goldman's jeans as well as an envelope and a piece of paper found near Goldman's body as possible shoe prints.</P>



<P>Deedrick said it was more likely the imprints were not made by a shoe. Goldman could have made a "swiping motion" and his shirt could have brushed against his jeans and left an imprint there, Deedrick said.</P>



<P>The imprints on the piece of paper and the envelope could have come from Goldman's jeans, Deedrick said.</P>



<P>Deedrick, a hair and fiber forensic expert, said he conducted tests with imprint patterns from Goldman's shirt, shoes and jeans and determined that it would be improper to exclude Goldman's clothing as the source of the imprints, as Dr. Lee did.</P>



<P>Under cross-examination from Barry Scheck, Deedrick admitted he is not a blood pattern expert and that the parallel line imprints on Goldman's jeans could have come from the heel of a shoe.</P>



<P>Scheck attacked Deedrick's lack of experience at crime scenes and suggested that he wasn't the most qualified agent at the FBI to examine bloody imprints on fabric, having never conducted such an examination.</P>



<P>Deedrick said that while he has examined imprint evidence in about 100 cases, most of the time he dealt with dust prints from hit-and-run vehicular accidents.</P>



<P>Following Deedrick, special agent Bodziak, a footprint expert, said that the imprints on the piece of paper and envelope could not have come from a shoe. The imprints are too small and the patterns didn't resemble any design he had ever seen, Bodziak said.</P>



<P>Bodziak testified in June that he had traveled to Italy to find the manufacturer of Bruno Maglias, the designer shoe that he said the killer wore.</P>



<P>Other than the imprints on the lower right and left legs of Goldman's jeans, which he has already been identified as coming from the Bruno Maglias, none of the other imprints were shoe prints, Bodziak said.</P>



<P>Other developments Thursday:</P>

	<LI>Lawyers reported they had settled the issue concerning the juror who had money problems regarding a rental property. The details have not been released.<P>



	<LI>Judge Lance Ito granted the defense an application for certificate of materiality and necessity for special agent Frederic Whitehurst, who is expected to be arrive in Los Angeles over the weekend. Whitehurst testified in the World Trade Center bombing that FBI forensic experts are routinely pressured to tailor evidence to favor prosecutors and that their lab techniques are sloppy.

<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>

<P><B>SEPTEMBER 15</B> - An FBI expert poked holes in the defense theory by testifying that defense expert Dr. Henry Lee erred when he claimed to have discovered unrecognizable bloody imprints at the murder scene.</P>



<P>The defense has suggested that the imprints Lee said he found on the walkway outside Nicole Brown Simpson's home were left by shoes of a second assailant.</P>



<P>But FBI Special Agent William Bodziak, who analyzes footprints at the agency's crime lab, testified that what Lee characterized as impressions on the walkway actually were tool marks and footprints left by the workmen who originally poured it.</P>



<P>Under questioning by Deputy District Attorney Marcia Clark, Bodziak also criticized Lee for basing his observations on his examination of photographs taken of other photographs.</P>



<P>Bodziak also testified that a second impression, identified by Lee as a footprint in a photograph taken June 25, 1994, was not present in a photograph taken on June 13. Bodziak speculated that the stain Lee found was left by someone who walked through the crime scene in the intervening days.</P>

<H2>Week by Week in the O.J. Simpson Criminal Trial</H2>



<H3>Week 35 (September 18 - 22, 1995)</H3>



<P><B>SEPTEMBER 18</B> - The prosecution called its last rebuttal witness -- at least for the time being.</P>



<P>Because of the unusual order of the proceedings, prosecutors will be allowed to reopen their rebuttal case if new defense witnesses are allowed to testify. If Judge Lance Ito blocks the testimony, the defense could rest its case.</P>



<P>Judge Ito has not yet decided whether the defense can call witnesses to attack the credibility of Detective Philip Vannatter and FBI Special Agent Roger Martz.</P>



<P>Vannatter and other detectives justified their warrantless search of O.J. Simpson's property several hours after the murders on the grounds they feared that someone inside was hurt or in danger. But the defense claims that two witnesses, a mob informer and a law enforcement agent, heard Vannatter declare over beers following court one day that police suspected Simpson was responsible for the murders.</P>



<P>The informant, Tony (The Animal) Fiato, also known as Tony Rome, has been seen publicly with Nicole Brown Simpson's sister, Denise Brown. She has denied having a relationship with him.</P>



<P>The defense also hopes to recall Martz, who testified that his analysis of blood found on a sock retrieved from Simpson's bedroom and on a gate behind Nicole Brown Simpson's house did not contain any signs of a preservative.</P>



<P>On Monday, prosecutors finished questioning FBI Special Agent William Bodziak. He testified that only one murderer walked through the crime scene. There was so much blood at the scene that a second assailant would have had to step in blood and leave behind footprints.</P>



<P>"It's impossible unless the person that committed the crime can fly," he testified.</P>



<P>During cross-examination, defense attorney Barry Scheck suggested that a second assailant could have come and gone from the scene without leaving tracks. This could have happened if Ronald Goldman died before Nicole Brown Simpson's throat was slashed.</P>



<P>"Are you asking me to assume there were two independent murders at the same place 10 minutes apart?" Bodziak responded.</P>



<P>The defense then began its rebuttal by recalling blood spatter expert, Herbert MacDonnell, to testify about the shrinkage of gloves Simpson was seen wearing during football broadcasts.</P>



<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>

<P><B>SEPTEMBER 19</B> - Two organized crime brothers turned government informants contradicted the testimony of the lead detective in the case when they testified that Philip Vannatter said he immediately suspected O.J. Simpson killed his former wife and a friend.</P>



<P>Larry and Craig Fiato, who are in the federal witness protection program, testified that in two casual conversations earlier this year, Vannatter said police went to Simpson's house because he was a suspect. Vannatter has testified that he and other detectives went to the Rockingham estate to inform Simpson of his former wife's death, and subsequently scaled a fence onto his property because they feared someone inside might be injured or in danger.</P>



<P>"The exact words I don't know," Larry Fiato said. "But it was something to the effect that he went over there as Mr. Simpson was the suspect."</P>



<P>Fiato's brother, Craig Anthony "Tony the Animal" Fiato, testified that he only heard Vannatter say "the husband is always the suspect. He didn't say O.J. Simpson." But Craig Fiato later said he believed Vannatter was talking about Simpson.</P>



<P>Vannatter told jurors Tuesday that he didn't recall making either statement and reiterated his claim that the four detectives went to Simpson's estate to notify him of his ex-wife's murder and to find someone to care for the couple's two young children.</P>



<P>"Mr. Simpson was no more of a suspect at that point than you were, Mr. Shapiro," Vannatter said when questioned by defense attorney Robert Shapiro. "Anybody that has personal contact with a murder victim before they're eliminated is a potential suspect and can be a potential suspect. I wish I was good enough to go to a crime scene, and within less than an hour be able to figure out who committed a murder, that would be great."</P>



<P>The judge ordered the television camera and the microphones turned off to avoid any photographs or recordings of the Fiato brothers because of their claims that they could be endangered if their identities became widely known.</P>



<P>The two men presented a markedly different appearance than others who have appeared at the trial. Larry Fiato, a heavy-set man dressed entirely in black except for a black checkered vest, was affable and willingly answered the defense's questions.</P>



<P>But Craig Fiato, an imposing figure with a black goatee, snow-white hair and a gold loop earring in his left ear, challenged many of the questions posed by defense attorney, Johnnie Cochran Jr.</P>



<P>The Fiato brothers live in Boston and were in Los Angeles in January to testify in a 1982 murder-for-hire trial when Vannatter came to see them in a hotel room.</P>



<P>Larry Fiato said he was drinking a beer, "laughing and joking ... shooting the breeze" when Vannatter made the comments.</P>



<P>A month later, he said Vannatter made a similar comment while the two were smoking cigarettes in a courthouse stairwell. That testimony was bolstered by FBI Special Agent Michael Wacks, who said he overheard the comment.</P>



<P>He said he felt the statement had "no import" because Vannatter was "totally sarcastic" when he said it.</P>



<P>Wacks said he didn't tell anyone at the time but that he notified his supervisor of the statement last week because he believed the defense had become aware of it.</P>



<P>During his testimony Tuesday, Vannatter said Simpson became a suspect only after police a bloody glove on his property. Shapiro then read part of Vannatter's cross-examination from March, when Shapiro asked the detective why four officers had to go to Simpson's house to tell him that his former wife had been killed.</P>



<P>Judge Lance Ito previously chastised Vannatter for engaging in "reckless disregard" for the truth when obtaining the search warrant for Simpson's home. The jury never heard about the judge's findings, but on Tuesday were informed of the problems with Vannatter's credibility.</P>



<P>In an effort to exclude the area of questioning about Vannatter, Deputy District Attorney Brian Kelberg dismissed the detective's comments as "a nothing statement" made by a bunch of men smoking cigarettes and "shooting the breeze."</P>



<P>Kelberg also suggested that Vannatter made the remarks partly out of frustration over the battering his department had taken in the case.</P>



<P>"Have you felt that you have been falsely accused, you as a Los Angeles Police Department officer, of entering into a conspiracy to convict an innocent man, Mr. Simpson?" Kelberg asked.</P>



<P>"You bet I have," Vannatter replied. "I've dedicated over 25 years of hard service to this city. And I've done a lot of work, and I've seen a lot of people murdered, innocently murdered. And I've attempted to do the best I can to come to successful conclusions on those."</P>



<P>In other developments:</P>



<P>Judge Ito released procedures for deliberations, revealing that there will be at least a one-hour warning for attorneys to get to court before a verdict is read. The judge also said he will read jury instructions before closing arguments, a somewhat unusual step. Normally, instructions are given after closing arguments, just before the jury begins deliberations. He told jurors that he expects to give them instructions Friday, and that closing arguments will begin Tuesday.</P>



<P>The defense filed an emergency appeal to the California Supreme Court asking it to reinstate Judge Lance Ito's original instruction to jurors that they can draw negative inferences from Mark Fuhrman's unavailability.</P>



<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>

<P><B>SEPTEMBER 20</B> - After nearly eight months in sequestration, the Simpson jury may have heard testimony from the final witness in the case.</P>



<P>LAPD commander Keith Bushey told the court that on the night Nicole Brown Simpson's murder, he ordered police detective Ron Phillips to find and notify O.J. Simpson "as soon as humanly possible." Prosecutors called Bushey to counter defense claims that Simpson was already a suspect when police went to Simpson's home.</P>



<P>Bushey said that the welfare of Simpson's children was at the heart of his order. He said he did not want the family to find out about the murder from the media.</P>



<P>Sending four detective -- Philips, Mark Fuhrman, Tom Lang and Philip Vannatter --was "not at all unusual" considering that there were potential witnesses to interview and that the children might have to be placed in police custody, Bushey said.</P>



<P>On cross-examination, defense lawyer Johnnie Cochran Jr. pointed out that LAPD policy was for the next of kin to be notified first. In this case, that would be Nicole Brown's parents.</P>



<P>Bushey agreed, but said that he was "driven by practicality" in deciding that Simpson, who lived nearby, should be notified first.</P>



<P>Cochran got Bushey to admit that he could not remember another case in which four detectives were asked to carry out the notification responsibility at one time.</P>



<P>Earlier in the day, Judge Lance Ito sustained the prosecution's objection to the testimony of FBI special agents Roger Martz and Frederic Whitehurst, whom the defense wished to call to undermine the prosecution's DNA evidence.</P>



<P>"The presentation of more complex and scientific testimony on a collateral issue would only serve to aggravate and confuse the sequestered jury," Ito wrote in the ruling.</P>



<P>In another ruling, Judge Ito granted the defense request to use videotaped testimony during their closing arguments. The taped segments must depict only witnesses and be available to both sides.</P>



<P>Prosecutor Sherri Lewis had earlier argued that taped segments may be taken out of context and will prolong the trial. She said that the courtroom camera is often not focused on the witness stand. And when it is, the high angle may cause a witness to appear on TV with a different demeanor from the one originally seen by the jurors.</P>



<P>Prosecutors were more successful in defeating a defense motion to limit the length of closing arguments. Cochran asked Ito to allot one day to each side, arguing that sequestration has been a tremendous hardship for the jury.</P>



<P>Clark said the defense's ulterior motive was to limit the prosecution's rebuttal portion of the closings.</P>



<P>Judge Ito denied the defense request, but warned that he will curtail arguments as he sees fit.</P>



<P>Later in the day, when lawyers were arguing over use of the word "syringe" in a stipulation involving the testimony of Thano Peratis, the nurse that drew a blood sample from Simpson's arm, Judge Ito's frustration with the trial was apparent.</P>



<P>"It's astonishing what we have sunk to here," he said, admonishing both sides for constantly bickering.</P>



<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>

<P><B>SEPTEMBER 21</B> - The jury will be allowed to consider both first- and second-degree murder when deciding the fate of O.J. Simpson.</P>



<P>Prosecutors sought the instruction to give jurors a choice in evaluating Simpson's conduct. But Simpson's lawyers -- dealt a strong blow by the ruling -- argued that allowing the jury to consider anything else but first-degree murder or an acquittal will "undercut the defense" and invite compromise.</P>



<P>But Prosecutor Brian Kelberg successfully argued that a reasonable juror could conclude that Simpson killed Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman, yet remain unconvinced he had the premeditation and deliberation required for a first-degree murder conviction.</P>



<P>Under such a scenario, Kelberg argued, jurors would be faced with a "Hobson's choice" of letting a guilty man go free or convicting him of a more serious charge to ensure a conviction.</P>



<P>"Jurors are not to be put in that position," he argued.</P>



<P>Judge Ito agreed, explaining that Goldman's murder could indeed have been committed at the spur of the moment and without premeditation, requiring a second-degree murder charge.</P>



<P>If Simpson is convicted of two first-degree murders, or a first-degree and a second-degree murder, he will automatically face a life sentence without parole. If, however, he is convicted of two second-degree murders, the sentence includes the possibility of parole.</P>



<P>Meanwhile, Judge Ito rejected almost all of the 38 proposed special instructions submitted by the defense. The defense was particularly angered by the judge's rejection of instructions defining how the jury should look at the scientific evidence.</P>



<P>The judge rejected five special instructions dealing with blood, hair and fiber analysis. The defense wanted the jurors to be instructed to first determine whether that evidence was preserved in an "unaltered and unchanged condition from the time of its seizure until the time it was analyzed." The defense also wanted an instruction for the jury to consider whether the evidence was left at the crime scene by the killer or "deposited" (I.e. planted) at a later time.</P>



<P>The prosecution argued such instructions would unfairly emphasize the chain of custody for certain items, and unfairly suggest the planting of evidence.</P>



<P>Judge Ito decided to give the traditional chain of custody instruction. The instruction tells jurors that they may disregard any evidence if they find that a reasonable chain of custody was not established.</P>



<P>The defense did however win a bid for an instruction saying random match statistics are not the same as statistics that indicate the likelihood of whether a defendant committed a crime. But, the judge rejected an instruction which would have told jurors that when a witness offers an opinion that hair or fibers bear similar characteristics, it does not necessarily mean they came from the same source.</P>



<P>Judge Ito, meanwhile, came up with his own special instruction about his decision to allow a prosecution witness to testify about a dream. Simpson acquaintance Ronald Shipp told jurors that after the murders, Simpson confided he had had dreams of killing his ex-wife. The judge will instruct jurors to first determine whether they believe Simpson made the statement. If they do, they then must decide what he meant by "dream."</P>



<P>In other developments:</P>



<P>The California Supreme Court denied an appeal that jurors be told more about why retired Detective Mark Fuhrman wasn't called back to testify after they heard a tape of him uttering a racial slur in contradiction to his trial testimony.</P>



<P>Fuhrman invoked the Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination outside the jury's presence when asked whether he planted evidence. The defense wanted jurors to be told he was "unavailable" to return and that they could consider that in weighing his truthfulness.</P>



<P>Judge Ito, who has plans to go on vacation next Friday through Monday, encouraged attorneys to consider extending their closing arguments into the evening. Prosecutors said they would consider the matter. Defense attorneys indicated a willingness to extend arguments into 9 or 10 pm.</P>



<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>

<P><B>SEPTEMBER 22</B> - "I did not, could not and would not have committed this crime," O.J. Simpson told the court outside the presence of the jury.</P>



<P>Despite objections from prosecutor Marcia Clark, Judge Ito asked Simpson to make a routine waiver of his right to testify. Clark had wanted Simpson to put the waiver in writing to stop him from making an emotional plea that might be leaked to the jurors through conjugal visits and phone calls.</P>



<P>"Much as I would like to address some of the misrepresentations made about myself, and my . . . and Nicole, concerning our life together," Simpson said in open court, "I am mindful of the mood and the stamina of this jury."</P>



<P>"I have confidence, a lot more it seems than Miss Clark has, of their integrity . . . and that they will find as the record stands now that I did not, could not and would not have committed this crime. I have four kids -- two kids I haven't seen in a year. They ask me every week, 'Dad, how much longer?' I want this trial over."</P>



<P>Simpson sounded choked up and received a pat on the back from defense lawyer Johnnie Cochran, Jr. as he sat down.</P>



<P>Outside the courtroom later in the day, Cochran told reporters that Simpson was asked a question by the judge and had a right to respond. He said Simpson was speaking from the heart and would have made an outstanding witness. But the prosecution's cross-examination would have "gone on forever," and "that would have been unfair," Cochran said.</P>



<P>Listening to Cochran, Fred Goldman, the father of murder victim Ronald Goldman, exploded in anger shortly after, calling Simpson "a coward" for not testifying.</P>



<P>"It is disgusting what he [Simpson] did. It is disgusting that his Dream Team -- Scheme Team maybe is more accurate -- would come here and stand in front of you and tell you it was his right to make a statement to the court. It is disgusting to me that the judge tolerated it."</P>



<P>Goldman said it was unrealistic to believe that the jurors would not receive word of the incident in some form. These people are not "sequestered to a point where they don't know anything that is going on in the outside world."</P>



<P>When the jury was brought into the courtroom, Judge Lance Ito read instructions to them for about 36 minutes. In a major victory for the prosecution, Judge Ito told them they could convict Simpson of first-degree or second-degree murder.</P>

<H2>Week by Week in the O.J. Simpson Criminal Trial</H2>



<H3>Week 36 (September 25 - 29, 1995)</H3>



<P><B>SEPTEMBER 25</B> - Judge Lance Ito cancelled a vacation and set 11-hour court days this week. The judge also barred the use of videotaped excerpts from the trial. The decision came after defense lawyers -- who wanted to use the footage -- failed to meet a morning deadline for submitting the tapes for the judge's review.</P>



<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>

<P><B>SEPTEMBER 26</B> - Deputy District Attorney Marcia Clark began her closing arguments with a preemptive strike against police detective Mark Fuhrman before taking aim at O.J. Simpson.</P>



<P>Calling Fuhrman a racist and a liar, Clark said, "It would be a tragedy if, with such overwhelming evidence, you find the defendant not guilty because of the racist attitudes of one officer."</P>



<P>Clark began her five-hour argument speaking softly, methodically presenting the basic elements of the prosecution's case with a jigsaw puzzle motif. She described each piece of evidence as another interlocking piece that fit together, pointing to Simpson's guilt. While there are "missing pieces," she urged jurors not to lose sight of the big picture.</P>



<P>Early in the afternoon, as Clark was talking about the cuts and bruises on Simpson's hands, she was abruptly interrupted when Judge Lance Ito imposed a TV blackout. Ito was concerned that the courtroom camera was showing Simpson's private notes in panning on his hands.</P>



<P>Calling it a "Flagrant violation" of attorney-client privilege, Judge Ito terminated TV coverage.</P>



<P>About an hour later, after a conference with lawyers from both sides and media attorney Kelly Sager, Ito allowed TV coverage to continue. Though replays of the camera close-ups do not appear to have show Simpson's notes, Ito ordered that the camera only shoot people in the courtroom from above the shoulders.</P>



<P>Ito also fined the local radio and television press association $1,500. The camera is operated by Court TV.</P>



<P>Clark took jurors through the evening of the murders, showing Simpson was unaccounted for between 9:36pm and 10:54 and that he left a trail of evidence from the murder scene to his home.</P>



<P>Darden, who argued for a little more than an hour, focused on Simpson's history of abusing his wife to prove he had motive to kill her. Darden also brought up Fuhrman, telling the jury not to lose focus on the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman.</P>



<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>

<P><B>SEPTEMBER 27</B> - "If it doesn't fit, you must acquit," Johnnie Cochran, Jr. repeated to jurors in closing arguments yesterday, attempting to equate the prosecution's failed glove experiment with other evidence used to incriminate O.J. Simpson.</P>



<P>Following prosecutor Christopher Darden, who claimed the defense was throwing up a smoke screen, Cochran launched an attack on the prosecution's timeline and police investigators, whom he charged with botching the investigation, conspiring to frame Simpson and lying on the witness stand.</P>



<P>Using the same words Simpson had used last week when he waived his right to testify, Cochran said Simpson "could not, would not, did not commit these crimes."</P>



<P>Cochran then said the jury was on a "journey toward justice" as he gave his version of the events of June 12, 1994, the night of the murders, starting with a video tape of Simpson and his ex-wife at their daughter's dance recitals.</P>



<P>Darden had repeatedly described Simpson as a time bomb with a burning fuse, growing increasingly closer to a full explosion. Cochran attempted to reduce the impact of accounts of Simpson's domestic violence by describing Simpson as imperfect, "not proud of some of the things he did. But [these things] don't add up to murder."</P>



<P>Scoffing Darden's charge that only Simpson had the rage to carry out such a ruthless attack on Nicole Brown, Cochran suggested that professional killers could have been after Ronald Goldman on the night of the killings.</P>



<P>Cochran pointed out that defense wittiness Dr. Henry Lee, a crime scene expert, visited the crime scene about two weeks after the incident and found an envelop at the crime scene that could have been the source of the crime. Police never found the envelope because competency "took a back seat right at the beginning," he said.</P>



<P>"They [the police] very soon pretended to solve this crime and implicated an innocent man and they never, ever looked for anyone else."</P>



<P>Cochran's two main targets on the LAPD were detectives Mark Fuhrman and Philip Vannatter. Describing Fuhrman as "the man who found the glove," and Vannatter as "the man who carried the blood," he worked from giant boards listing the "big lies" that they told in their efforts frame O.J. Simpson.</P>



<P>Cochran said that the gloves found at the murder scene and Simpson's estate didn't fit Simpson simply because they weren't worn by Simpson. "Their [the prosecution's] case from that day forward was slipping away from them," he said.</P>



<P>"We may all live to be a hundred years old and I hope we do, but you will always remember those glove, when Darden asked him to try them on, didn't fit."</P>



<P>Further mocking the prosecution's case, Cochran donned a knit cap, similar to the one prosecutor's entered into evidence. Cochran said it is absurd to think that Simpson would wear the cap as a disguise. "You have been seeing me for a year," Cochran said. "I put this knit cap on, who am I? I am still Johnnie Cochran with a knit cap. . . O.J. Simpson in a knit cap from two blocks away is still O.J. Simpson.," he said.</P>



<P>"Even the prosecutors say he is so famous that he can't go anywhere he wouldn't be recognized."</P>



<P>While it will be left to defense lawyer Barry Scheck to discuss the DNA evidence, Cochran asked the jurors why, if Simpson was rushing back from a bloody crime scene, there was no blood found on the door knobs, banister or white carpets at Simpson's Estate.</P>



<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>

<P><B>SEPTEMBER 28</B> - O.J. Simpson's defense team wrapped up its final arguments with a verbal one-two punch: one aimed at jurors' hearts, the other an appeal to their heads.</P>



<P>Johnnie Cochran Jr., told jurors that by setting Simpson free, they would make themselves custodians of the Constitution and saviors of the Los Angeles Police Department. Cochran began the day and ended it, quoting the Bible and urging jurors to vote their feelings as well as their intellect. He concluded by urging the jurors "to come to "a well-reasoned decision."</P>



<P>In between Cochran's two appearances was Simpson lawyer Barry Scheck, who attacked the state's blood and other evidence. "There is a cancer at the heart of this case," he argued. "And that's what this evidence shows."</P>



<P>On the second day of his impassioned final summation, Cochran accused police of falsely implicating Simpson in "a rush to judgment, an obsession to win at any cost." At the center of the alleged plot was former detective Mark Fuhrman, who Cochran described as a "lying, perjuring, genocidal racist" with a long-time vendetta against Simpson.</P>



<P>Fuhrman, he reminded jurors, lied to them in March, when he denied uttering racist slurs in the past 10 years. He also was a racist, Cochran said, recalling Roderick Hodge, a black man who testified last month that Fuhrman had called him "nigger."</P>



<P>To reiterate his point, Cochran played a segment from the Fuhrman tapes, in which the former detective makes a racial slur. He followed that with a letter written by another witness, who testified that Fuhrman once said all black people should be collected and burned.</P>



<P>"There was another person who talked about burning people," Cochran said. "That person was Adolf Hitler."</P>



<P>Accompanying Fuhrman on the morning after the killings was Detective Philip Vannatter, who also lied to keep their case intact, Cochran said. They were "twins of deception," he said.</P>



<P>Fuhrman had hated Simpson since answering a domestic-violence call at the former football star's Rockingham Avenue home in 1985, Cochran told jurors. When he had a chance to frame Simpson with a leather glove, he and other detectives didn't hesitate to "win at any cost," he said.</P>



<P>Then, they carried it further, planting blood and other evidence to tie Simpson to a crime he didn't commit, Cochran said. And no one in the department, he said, tried to stop the "cover-up."</P>



<P>Cochran leaned toward the jurors and smiled. "If you grew up in this country, then you know there are Fuhrmans out there," he said.</P>



<P>Fuhrman was just one corrupt cop among several, and his dishonest tactics ultimately tainted other police officers, too, said Cochran.</P>



<P>"There is something about corruption," Cochran said. "There is something about a rotten apple that will ultimately infect the entire barrel.</P>



<P>Scheck picked up on the theme, saying Fuhrman and others went to great lengths to build an unfair case.</P>



<P>"Something is terribly wrong" with the physical evidence against Simpson, said Scheck, alluding to testimony from forensics specialist Henry Lee, who once characterized the prosecution case as "something wrong."</P>



<P>He questioned the blood samples and DNA findings taken from a pair of socks taken from Simpson's bedroom. The socks, which prosecutors said contain blood and other evidence tying Simpson to the crime, should be inadmissible, said Scheck.</P>



<P>The socks had been soaked in blood after the killings, said Scheck -- not during a bloody struggle, as police and prosecutors claim. At the crime scene, some of the blood collected at the Bundy Drive site was tainted because it wasn't refrigerated in time, said Scheck.</P>



<P>And Vannatter was allowed to carry a sample of Simpson's blood, drawn the day after the killings, to Simpson's estate, said Scheck -- proof again, he said, that police were trying to cook up a case against Simpson.</P>



<P>He also hammered at criminologists Dennis Fung and his assistant, Andrea Mazzola, criticized for their blood-collection methods earlier in the trial. Fung's assistant, said Scheck, was a rookie, and she committed rookie errors.</P>



<P>Mazzola said she initialed paper containers, or bindles, as she collected blood from the site, Scheck told jurors. "Her initials were on no bindles -- zero," Scheck said. "Something is wrong."</P>



<P>Scheck also questioned some of the evidence from the gloves presumed used in the killings, noting that Simpson's arm hairs weren't found on them -- but one, from a white person, was found on the glove at Simpson's house, he said.</P>



<P>He also criticized the blood findings taken from the Bronco, claiming some DNA evidence indicates the late addition of extra blood to frame Simpson.</P>



<P>The questions surrounding the evidence is enough to free Simpson, said Scheck, who likened the prosecution's case to a bug in a bowl.</P>



<P>"How many cockroaches do you have to find in a bowl of spaghetti" before you won't eat it? he asked. "This is reasonable doubt."</P>



<HR WIDTH=375 ALIGN=LEFT>

<P><B>SEPTEMBER 29</B> - The case went to the jury after prosecutors concluded their final remarks with an emotional reminder of the brutal nature of the crime.</P>



<P>Prosecutor Marcia Clark concluded her final remarks by returning to the tortured relationship between O.J. Simpson and his former wife that prosecutors contend set a motive for murder.</P>



<P>She played a tape of one of Nicole Simpson's emergency 911 calls, in 1993, in which she pleaded for police help: "He's back. He's O.J.Simpson.I think you know his record." As the tape was played, images from her life were flashed for jurors: her battered face; a picture of her at a police station, her pants dirty from a fall in the mud; a swollen arm.</P>



<P>The screen then filled with photos taken years later, in 1994 - black socks at the foot of Simpson's bed; the bloody glove at his Rockingham Avenue estate; the blood drops at Simpson's driveway; Simpson's Ford Bronco; blood on the Bundy Drive walkway.</P>



<P>And then, finally, the screen filled with the tightest shot yet of Nicole Simpson's body lying at the foot of steps outside her home. It was followed by a close-up of Ronald Goldman's crumpled body in a gated area.</P>



<P>"I don't have to say anything else," Clark said. "Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the people of the state of California, because we have proven beyond a reasonable doubt, far beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant committed these murders, we ask you to find the defendant guilty of murder in the first degree of Ronald Goldman and Nicole Brown."</P>



<P>The jury then received final instructions from Judge Lance Ito and met briefly to select a foreperson.</P>



<P>On the final day of the case, prosecutors Clark and Christopher Darden spent five hours reviewing elements of their case, debunking defense team theories and calling for a calm, logical approach to deliberations.</P>



<P>"It's time to stand up. It is time to stand up. The Constitution says a man has no right to kill and get away with it just because one of the investigating officers is a racist," Darden said.</P>



<P>During his rebuttal summation, Darden addressed the emotional arguments raised by the defense, contending that Simpson's attorneys were trying to persuade the jury to hold Simpson to a higher standard.</P>



<P>"No one is above the law -- not the police, not the rich," Darden told the jury. "O.J. Simpson is not above the law...Everybody knows he killed."</P>



<P>Detective Mark Fuhrman is a racist, Darden said, and there is racism in the Los Angeles Police Department, but he warned the jury that acquitting Simpson won't send the message the defense claims it would.</P>



<P>"I told you there would be smoke. . . . Yesterday we heard the smoke," Darden said, referring to defense attorney Johnnie Cochran Jr.'s closing argument.</P>



<P>After an anecdote about Martin Luther King, Darden told the majority-black jury: "Some folks like to get you all riled up, get you so upset that you move suddenly, so you drown on the minutia, choke on the smoke.</P>



<P>"I heard a lot about courage and you are 14 courageous people and everyone in this room knows that and nobody can ever call you cowards, nobody can ever accuse you people of running away," Darden said, responding to Cochran's argument that acquittal would take courage. "I think the courageous thing to do in this case would be to look at all the evidence," Darden said.</P>



<P>Darden also ridiculed Simpson's alibi.</P>



<P>"Chippin' golf balls. There were golf balls in that little black bag," he said, mocking the defense explanation of Simpson's alibi.</P>



<P>"That was the night he was supposedly suffering from acute arthritis," Darden said. And the black bag that Simpson refused to let houseguest Brian "Kato" Kaelin put in the limousine on the night of the murders was supposedly put in Simpson's golf bag, he said.</P>



<P>Darden pulled out the golf bag and said there was nothing in it.</P>



<P>"They want you to throw your common sense out the window, just chuck it out the window. You can't do that," he said. "They have one racist cop."</P>



<P>Clark also meticulously worked through the evidence, picking apart defense evidence-planting and contamination theories and dismissing them as absurd.</P>



<P>At one point, she asked why why police would plant a sock at the foot of Simpson's bed, then plant blood on that same sock severak weeks after it was collected.</P>



<P>"What we have here is logic and evidence and common sense," Clark told the jury.</P>

<H2>Week by Week in the O.J. Simpson Criminal Trial</H2>



<H3>Week 37 (October 2 - 3, 1995)</H3>



<P><B>OCTOBER 2</B> - After deliberating for less than four hours, the jury announced that it has reached a verdict.</P>



<P>The quick verdict surprised many legal analysts, who had predicted it would take anywhere from two days to two months.</P>



<P>When Judge Lance Ito called the jury of 10 women and two men back into court, he said: "You buzzed three times and indicated that after receiving the verdict form that you have reached a verdict in this case. Is that correct, Madam Forewoman?"</P>



<P>"Yes," replied the 51-year-old black woman who was elected by the jurors to lead the panel.</P>



<P>Earlier in the day, jurors asked to re-hear testimony from the limousine driver who drove Simpson to the airport shortly after the murders.</P>



<P>The request for a readback of Allan Park's testimony suggested the jurors were looking at the critical issue of whether Simpson had enough time to kill Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman.</P>



<P>Park, who picked Simpson up for a trip to the airport, was considered one of the most important time-line witnesses, joining houseguest Brian "Kato" Kaelin, the last person known to see Simpson before the murders. Their testimony created a 78-minute window of opportunity for Simpson to commit the murders.</P>



<P>Simpson contended he was at home preparing for a trip to Chicago, but he presented no alibi testimony.</P>



<P>Park said he arrived at Simpson's house at 10:22 pm the night of the murders and didn't see Simpson's Bronco parked outside when he was searching the curb for street numbers. Park testified that at 10:55 pm he saw a large, shadowy figure of an African-American person at the front door of Simpson's Rockingham estate. Moments later, Simpson answered the intercom that Park had been sounding for 15 minutes.</P>

SUPERIOR COURT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA
FOR THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES

SHARON RUFO, ET AL., N/A, PLAINTIFFS,

VS.

ORENTHAL JAMES SIMPSON, ET AL., DEFENDANTS.

SANTA MONICA, CALIFORNIA
FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 1, 1996
8:46 A.M.

DEPARTMENT NO. WEQ
HON. HIROSHI FUJISAKI, JUDGE

(REGINA D. CHAVEZ, OFFICIAL REPORTER)

(The Court ordered sealed the notes and transcript of proceedings
heard in Chambers, pages 2 through 4.)

(Jurors resume their respective seats.)

(The following proceedings were held in open court, in the presence of
the jury.)

THE COURT: Morning.

JURORS: Good morning, Your Honor.

THE CLERK: You are still under oath.

And would you please state your name again for the record.

THE WITNESS: Tom Lange, L-A-N-G-E. THOMAS LANGE, the witness on the
stand at the time of the adjournment on October 31, 1996, having been
previously duly sworn, was examined and testified further as follows:
CROSS-EXAMINATION (Continued) BY` MR. BAKER:

Q. Good morning, sir.

A. Good morning.

Q. Now, last night -- last night, after the jury was released and we
stayed around to have a hearing with the judge, you stayed and waited
for the Goldmans did you not?

A. I was more or less waiting for the attorneys.

Q. And you walked across the street to the hotel with the Goldmans,
did you not?

A. I believe they were with us, yes.

Q. And then you went up to the suite with the attorneys over at the
Doubletree Hotel and spent some time getting prepared for today's
testimony, right?

A. Yes, we did.

Q. How long did you spend last night?

A. Fifteen or twenty minutes, I believe.

Q. And so, how long did you spend this morning?

A. Spend this morning?

Q. Yeah, getting ready. You were over there this morning at the hotel,
weren't you?

A. Yes. We had breakfast together.

Obviously, the case was discussed. I would have a problem with
"getting ready." I really don't know what you mean by "getting ready."

If you mean getting prepared, no.

Q. Oh?

A. We discussed exhibits that I'd been talking about, certainly.

Q. What exhibits did you discuss?

A. Mostly exhibits that you've seen yesterday.

Q. Now, you definitely would agree that if you have the opportunity,
because of your friendship with the Goldmans, you tend to favor the
Goldmans in this case, correct?

A. Mr. Baker, I do not tend to favor anyone in this case.

Q. So your answer to my question is simply no, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay. Now, you would never tend to flavor your testimony towards
their side because -- well, strike that. How many other victims, next
of kin of victims of crimes, did you invite to your retirement party,
other than the Goldmans?

A. I didn't invite the Goldmans.

Q. Oh, they just happened to be there?

A. That's their choice, certainly. And they decided to show up, along
with 350 other people.

Q. I see. Wasn't an intimate affair?

A. I'm sorry?

Q. Wasn't an intimate affair?

A. An intimate affair? I don't think so.

Q. All right. Yesterday --

MR. BAKER: Would you put up that -- light up the Elmo, please.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Yesterday, we were talking about the closed-in area,
and it was your opinion, sir, that the soil is exceedingly soft, so
that the hole that was dug in the middle photograph on the left was
possibly done in a very short period of time, correct?

A. Well, the soil is loose, and it's certainly possible that it was
dug out in a very short period of time. If someone was in there
routing around or fighting each other, certainly.

Q. And that depression in the dirt there is what, six, eight inches,
twelve inches deep?

A. Something like that.

Q. So there was a lot of dirt being kicked around in that area, true?

A. The closed-in area?

Well, it depends on what you mean by "a lot of dirt." I think what you
see is what you get here in this photograph.

Certainly, the only dirt that's disturbed to any extent is that hole.

Q. Well, the entire area from the sidewalk, all the way to six feet
over to the -- to the fence, that's all dirt, isn't it?

A. It's all dirt, but there are trees and stumps around the hole.

Q. There's no ground cover?

A. No; it's minimal ground cover. You can see what it is in the
photograph.

Q. So that certainly the boots that Mr. Goldman was wearing got
covered with some degree of dirt, true?

A. Well, there's dirt on the boots.

Q. And that indicated to you that there was a struggle going on in the
closed-in area, true?

A. Well, that wasn't the only factor. It was pretty evident, though,
from everything I had, that that indeed is where the struggle
occurred.

Q. Okay. And --

(Counsel displays blow-up entitled "Evidence from closed-in area of
Bundy.")

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, you examined the boots in some detail, did you
not, when you were in the closed-in area?

A. I looked at them, but I have a hard time with "in some detail."

Q. Well, does the picture on the upper left-hand corner, does that
indicate to you that that was dirt that was in the exhibit --

MR. BAKER: What's the number?

MR. P. BAKER: 1349.

(The instrument herein referred to as Board containing photographs of
evidence at closed-in area of Bundy crime scene was marked for
identification as Defendants' Exhibit No. 1349.)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Exhibit 1349, is that dirt you believe to be from
the struggle in the closed-in area?

A. It appears to be dirt, yes.

(Indicating.)

Q. There's trace evidence in the middle photograph of the exhibit
that's up there, correct?

A. That's -- Appears that way, yes.

Q. And then there is a cut on the toe, which would appear to be on the
right boot, I believe, of Mr. Goldman?

A. That's correct.

Q. And that wasn't discovered by you until Dr. Lee discovered that,
correct?

A. No. I observed the cut on the boot, I believe, that morning.

Q. Oh, did you?

Did you put it in your notes?

Maybe I missed it.

A. No.

Again, as I stated yesterday, there are probably several things that
you won't find in the notes.

These types of items are later examined in the lab by a criminalist,
and that's where I'd rather have these types of things done, rather
than have any -- myself speculate at the crime scene as to what it
might be.

Q. Now, the cut on the boot was a fresh cut, was it not?

There was no dirt in that cut, was there?

A. Well, again, I didn't at the time. I didn't inspect it that
closely. And I'd be uncomfortable with saying whether or not it was
fresh or not.

Q. Well, did you subsequently learn that it was determined to be
without dirt in it?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Calls for hearsay, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) In rendering your opinions that you gave relative to
-- as co-lead detective on the case, did you become aware that that
cut was a fresh cut?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, Your Honor. Calls for hearsay; gave no
opinions on the direct on that point.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Well, when you observed that cut, was it in the
morning of the 13th of June 1994, did it cross your mind that that was
consistent with Mr. Goldman attempting to ward off an attacker with a
knife?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection.

THE WITNESS: Yes.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: It was consistent. And I believe he was on the ground,
perhaps kicking out at his assailant when this occurred.

Q. You thought he was possibly on the ground and kicking out at his
assailant?

A. I certainly believe there's a possibility of that, yes.

Q. So that after he had -- well, strike that.

It was certainly your view that the encounter started at the area
where the cap and glove was, and went around the north -- strike that
-- the east fenced area to the north fenced area, and then Mr. Goldman
was down and kicking at his assailant?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Compound, outside the scope, and it's also
speculative.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: I don't think with the evidence we can say exactly where
he pointed down to a small area where this began. I think that
everything occurred -- occurred within that area.

As far as him being down, I think that's very possibly consistent with
the dirt, the hole that you alluded to earlier.

I think it's just speculation to say exactly where it started.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) So you don't have an opinion as to where it
commenced, true?

A. I don't think anyone can say exactly where it started, no.

Q. Mr. Lange, I didn't ask you whether you believe anyone can say. All
I'm asking you, sir, respectfully, is: Do you have an opinion?

A. It would be the same response. It would go along with me not having
an opinion, no.

Q. Thank you.

A. I don't know who does.

MR. BAKER: Well, move to strike the gratuitous remark added to the
last part of the answer.

THE COURT: Stricken.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Mr. Lange, in your analysis of the evidence that you
made on June 13, 1994, that you documented in your notes, you tested
to see whether or not the gate could be opened from inside the house,
did you not?

A. I believe so.

Q. That was of significance to you, was it not?

A. Well, yes and no. It could be. Down the line, it could be a
significant factor.

Q. Well, let's go to page 6 of your notes.

You indicate: The door release is inoperable, clicks only.

And that would be the button that was in the kitchen that was
connected to the intercom at the gate area, correct?

A. I believe so.

Q. The area -- if you look at the monitor -- can we have the diagram?

And we have the diagram in the closed-in area in front of 875 South
Bundy. The box, the white box to the left of that, has the box within
a box, if you will?

A. Yes.

Q. That's the aerial depiction, is it not, of the area where the
intercom comes to the gate area, correct?

A. You know I'd have to look at the photograph. I haven't looked at
that in a couple of years.

Q. Well --

A. The reason I'm uncomfortable is because there's also a mailbox
there somewhere.

Q. Right.

A. That may be the mailbox.

Q. Okay. Fair enough.

One, there is a mailbox, as well as an area where you have the
intercom. That's on a pole, as I recall, is it not?

A. Yes. But I don't think it's what you pointed out. I think perhaps
you pointed out the mailbox.

Q. Okay. In any event, sir --

A. Well, I'm trying to be as accurate as I can. I don't want to point
out an intercom if it's a mailbox.

Q. In any event, sir as you recall, there is an intercom box at the
front of the gated area entering the property, that someone comes up
and they can push a button and communicate inside the house, correct?

A. Yes, there's an intercom.

Q. And that intercom is then inside the condominium; that intercom is
connected to the various intercom boxes and the various rooms, true?

A. That's correct.

Q. And as I recall -- you can correct me if I'm wrong -- there's only
one button that will allow somebody to get into the gate. And that was
in the kitchen, was it not?

A. Yes.

Q. You checked and determined that that button was inoperable; it
would click, but it would now allow someone to get in the gate, true?

A. We couldn't get it to work; that's correct.

Q. That indicated to you that, in your being a detective of some 20
years, that Nicole Brown had to come down and open the gate to let Mr.
Goldman in, correct?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Speculation, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Well, did you ever formulate an opinion that,
because the gate release was inoperable, that Ms. Brown had to come
down and open the gate?

MR. MEDVENE: Same objection. Also outside the scope.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Okay. You didn't make -- in terms of your notes, you
didn't make any conclusions relative to the door release being
inoperable, correct, on June 13, 1994, when you were doing your
inspection?

A. I don't -- I haven't reviewed that in some time. If you'd like to
show it to me...

Q. Sure, I'd be happy to.

A. I'm a little uncomfortable, again, with things I haven't looked at
in months and sometimes years.

Q. Right down at the the bottom of page 6, sir.

(Witness reviews document.)

A. Door release inoperable. Clicks only.

Q. Okay.

A. If that's what you're referring to, that's what I have.

Q. You made no conclusions as to the significance of that when you
were doing your crime-scene processing on June 13, 1994, true?

MR. MEDVENE: Same objection as previously made, Your Honor: Outside
the scope, calls for speculation.

THE COURT: Answer yes or no.

THE WITNESS: May I have the question again, please.

(The reporter read the record as follows:)

"Q. You made no conclusions as to the significance of that when you
were doing your crime-scene processing on June 13, 1994, true?"

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You came to no conclusion as to the significance of
that front gate being inoperable from inside the house after you did
your crime-scene processing on June 13, 1994, correct?

A. Not necessarily; I had thoughts on it.

Q. And were those thoughts that Ms. Brown had to come outside of the
condominium, down the steps, and open the gate to allow entry for Mr.
Goldman in?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Speculation, outside the scope, Your Honor;
asked and answered previously.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: I thought that was a possibility, certainly.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Well, you certainly had evidence that the gate
didn't open, and you had two victims' bodies inside the gated area,
didn't you?

A. Yes.

Q. Didn't that then become a logical conclusion, that she was down
there and opened the gate, before either of the two people were
attacked?

A. Well, again, it's a possibility, Mr. Baker, but we can't say for
sure because there are other factors. Electronic releases, some gates
can stay open and just be leaning against the lock, allowing someone
to open them.

This particular gate also had an inside dog latch that one would have
to reach over the top and release from the inside to enter.

So there are other factors. What you -- the scenario that you gave is
a possibility. But I don't think we can say with -- for sure.

Q. Well, in terms of having both of the people just inside the gated
area, and an area that is approximately -- from the gate to where the
body of Nicole Brown was found was three feet?

A. Something like that, yes.

Q. And from the head of Nicole Brown to the feet of Mr. Goldman was
only two feet, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. And so they were both in a very closed-in area, correct?

A. That's correct.

That's correct.

Q. In that closed-in area, Mr. Lange, there was evidence of -- there
was evidence of a violent struggle, correct?

A. I would certainly call it a violent struggle, yes.

Q. Now, in that closed-in area -- and evidence of the violent struggle
included the pager of Mr. Goldman, which was to the north and actually
outside of the fenced area depicted by this little area here, right?

A. That's correct.

Q. Okay. I don't know if you can see this, sir.

A. I'll get up, if you like.

(Indicating.)

Q. This is the pager, is it not, on the outside of the fence that is
on the north portion of the fence?

A. That's correct.

Q. All right.

And you can see them a little clearer down here?

A. Yeah.

(Indicating to photo on board marked "Blood stains from closed-in area
at Bundy.")

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) And Mr. Goldman's pants had pockets in them,
correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And his pager was possibly, or maybe attached to a belt or
something?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Calls for speculation.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) The keys were found basically at the feet of Mr.
Goldman, correct?

A. In the general vicinity, yes.

Q. And the keys are indicated in, I believe -- and I apologize because
it's under these leaves in this photo, the middle photo of --

MR. BAKER: What's this board, Phil?

MR. P. BAKER: That is 1342.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Lower middle photo of 1342, those are the keys, and
they were found approximately at his feet, correct?

A. Yes, that's correct.

Q. All right. And the hat and the glove were found in basically the
same location, right at the entranceway where the gate is, correct?

A. Well, just inside the gate, yes.

Q. And the then the keys and the pager were scattered throughout the
area. In other words, they -- the pager went all the way to the north,
six feet away from where the hat and the glove were found?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Speculative, vague, scattered all over the
area.

THE COURT: Speculative. Overruled.

THE WITNESS: I would have a problem with the phraseology, scattered
all over the area. You were referring to two items. The keys were in
close proximity to the glove. And the cap, the pager was, indeed, I
believe, about two feet beyond Mr. Goldman.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, the glove and hat were under the vegetation,
correct?

A. Partially. There were a couple of leaves over the top of them.

Q. And the cap was actually partially under the fence, correct?

A. I'd have to take a look. I mean, it's a possibility that a little
bit might have been under the rung, sure.

Q. Under the horizontal bar?

A. Yeah, the lower rung.

MR. P. BAKER: That's number 40.

(indicating to screen.)

THE WITNESS: That -- there is a small portion that appears to be below
the lower rung.

Q. In that photo, is somebody lifting up the foliage, or can you tell?

MR. MEDVENE: Lack of foundation, Your Honor.

MR. BAKER: Put that photo with 102 up there, Phil, please, the one
marked 102.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) That's the way the leaves were when you looked at
them, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And the hat was underneath the leaves, as well as partially
underneath the horizontal member of the fence, right?

A. Partially, yes.

Q. As you indicated, that area is really very, very loose dirt, right?

A. It's much looser to the rear is what I alluded to.

This is possibly a little more packed in this area, but there is loose
dirt. (Indicating.)

Q. And did you ever pick that cap up and drop it six or nine feet on
the plants to see if it would go underneath the leaves on the plants,
or would have to be kicked underneath?

A. I never touched the cap.

Q. Did you ever watch Mr. Fuhrman pick up the glove at any time during
the time that you were there?

A. No.

Q. Now, the cap didn't have any dirt on it, did it?

Had little pieces of debris, but no dirt on it?

A. I did not examine the cap that morning. It was checked by the
criminalist and subsequently taken to the lab.

Q. As it turned out, it had absolutely certainly no blood of Mr.
Simpson's on it, did it?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Calls for conclusions.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, the Bundy glove, you examined that?

A. No.

Q. You looked at it?

A. Yes.

Q. And that didn't have any dirt on it, either, did it?

A. I didn't look at the underside. And again, I looked at it from a
distance; I didn't handle it. Again, that's done by the criminalist.

Q. You examined the cap and glove earlier, and identified these as the
cap and glove that you saw at Bundy, correct?

This is -- the exhibit -- I've got 77 and 78 on here.

A. I said they appeared to be the same

Q. And did you -- did you see any dirt on either of those items?

A. Once again, I wasn't really looking for dirt in -- and I didn't
look at the underside. It was a very cursory observation.

Q. So the answer to my question is no, you didn't see any dirt,
correct?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, Your Honor. The question's been answered. He
explained what he did.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, did it occur to you in view of where --

THE COURT: Excuse me, Mr. Baker. Can I -- the clerk has a question.

THE CLERK: I think you're using the criminal exhibit numbers 77, 78.

MR. BAKER: Oh.

THE CLERK: For clarity sake, you want to make sure I you have the
right number. I'm not sure what they are.

MR. BAKER: You're absolutely right. Sorry.

THE CLERK: I don't know what numbers. I don't have it in front of me.

THE COURT: Is there a number?

MR. BAKER: There's no number on them whatsoever except the number that
I read. It's clear that the evidence tags indicate that's the criminal
trial number.

THE CLERK: If you like to mark those exhibits next in order.

MR. BLASIER: Its exhibit -- knit cap is 121 and the -- 131 is the knit
cap, 129 is the glove.

THE CLERK: Thank you.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, in you inspections that morning of June 13,
1994, did it occur to you that without -- with the absence of any dirt
on either of those items, they could have been placed there?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Lack of foundation, assumes facts not in
evidence.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) From your entire crime scene investigation, did it
occur to you that the cap or glove may have been placed in the area
that you saw them on June 13, 1994?

A. Certainly not.

Q. Never occurred to you?

A. Not in any way.

Q. All right. Now, in terms of the blood in that -- in the closed-in
area, there was blood on the fence; there was blood on the soil; there
was blood on Mr. Goldman's clothes.

And if we go over to the walkway, there was blood on the walkway and
there was blood on Ms. Brown's clothing, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

Now, none of the blood in the closed-in area was consistent with Mr.
Simpson's blood, true?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Calls for conclusion and lack of foundation.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. BAKER: Well, did you, in terms of you being the co-lead detective
in the case, you certainly became aware of the blood and you testified
about blood drops yesterday morning, did you not?

MR. MEDVENE: If the court please, we attempted to get in blood
testimony yesterday and Mr. Baker objected.

Same objection: Calls for conclusion; lack of foundation.

THE COURT: I didn't hear the question.

MR. BAKER: I said in terms of his being the co-lead detective, he
certainly became aware of the results of the blood collected in the
closed in area.

THE COURT: I don't know if that was the question. I thought that was a
declarative statement.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Did you become aware of the results of the blood
that was collected from in the closed-in area as a result of you being
the co-lead detective in this case?

MR. MEDVENE: Calls for hearsay.

THE COURT: You may answer yes or no.

THE WITNESS: Yes.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) And you became aware that none of the blood
collected in the closed-in area was consistent with Mr. Simpson's
blood, true?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Calls for hearsay.

THE COURT: That's sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Did you, in your role as co-lead detective, find out
if there was any blood on the cap or the glove that was consistent
with Mr. Simpson's?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Lack of foundation. Calls for hearsay, Your
Honor.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Did you, at any time, determine whether or not there
were any fingerprints of Mr. Simpson in the crime scene area, that
we've entitled the closed-in area or the walkway?

A. I did.

Q. And there were none, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. And, in fact -- in fact, Detective Lange, there were eight
identifiable fingerprints that were never identified as to anyone,
true?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, Your Honor. Outside the Court's order. It's
also not relevant, Your Honor.

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, it's not outside the Court's order. I'd like to
be heard.

THE COURT: I don't think it is either. Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Not one of the identifiable fingerprints found at
the crime scene area in the closed-in area or on the walkway was
consistent with Mr. Simpson's; isn't that true?

A. Yes. I don't believe his prints were found at the scene. That's
correct.

Q. And, in fact, Mr. Lange, there were eight identifiable fingerprints
found that you couldn't identify with any human being, true; that was
known to be either the victim, Mr. Goldman or the police?

A. That's not necessarily true. In an unidentifiable print, sometimes
the points are so low that it couldn't belong to one of the people who
you attempted to eliminate, and couldn't, because there are not enough
points. I'd have to look at those prints individually and see how many
points, in fact, were there and then I could give you an opinion. But
just because the print has been not identified doesn't necessarily
mean that it was eliminated from those who were at the scene.

Q. Let me see if I can make my questions very clear to you. There is,
in your business, that is, being a detective, identifiable and non
identifiable prints, true?

A. That's a general term, yes.

Q. If a print is identifiable, that means there's enough points on the
prints so that if you can find a match, there is enough points to make
it a definitive identification, correct?

A. Depending on the amount of points. It's generally ten.

Q. And --

A. However, if you have seven or eight that are consistent, you cannot
totally eliminate that individual.

Q. Mr. Lange, I want you to assume -- well, strike that.

Did you look at, in terms of you're being the co-lead detective on
this case, that there were 17 prints that were identifiable using the
language that we have just discussed?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Assumes facts not in evidence; outside the
scope, Your Honor. Lack of foundation.

THE COURT: Assumes facts not in evidence thus far. Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Well, in terms of the prints, Mr. Lange, were there,
or were there not, eight identifiable fingerprints that were not able
to be matched with any known person who is at the crime scene at any
time?

A. There were. I don't know if it was eight. There were some with an
insufficient amount of swirls, points; whatever you want to call them,
to match, that's correct, because the insufficiency of information.

Q. Is it your testimony, as you sit here today, that the prints that
were unidentifiable were unidentifiable not because they couldn't
match them to a person, but because the prints themselves were not
adequate to match? Is that your testimony? I want to be sure on this.

A. Well, I don't know. Again, I believe I'd like to see the print
reports. It's been some time since I looked at them. But when you say
unidentifiable, it could possibly mean that there's just not enough
information to make an identification.

Q. I want to understand your testimony here in this courtroom. Are you
saying to this jury, that the prints that were taken from the crime
scene were not identifiable because there wasn't enough information on
the prints; or you don't know; or the third alternative, that they
were identifiable but matched no one?

A. Mr. Baker, you gave me a very general term in the word
unidentifiable. And as I tried to explain to you, I would have to look
at each and every one of those prints in order to render an opinion as
to what you're asking.

Q. So, Mr. Lange, I take it, then, you don't know whether or not the
prints that were not matched to anyone had enough points to match or
not, correct?

A. Of course not. I haven't looked at that.

Q. And the only thing you are aware of is that they weren't Mr.
Simpson's.

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Calls to conclusion, Your Honor. Lack of
foundation.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You are aware -- well, strike that.

Now, in your analysis, there was blood from Nicole Brown on Ron
Goldman, right?

A. That's correct.

Q. And there was blood from Ron Goldman on Nicole Brown's clothing?

A. Objection to this area.

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Lack of foundation. Calls for conclusion.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Well, in your role as co-lead detective, you
certainly learned whether there was blood transfer before you wrote
the back-up report that we were discussing yesterday; isn't that true?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Argumentative, relevance, materiality, Your
Honor.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. BAKER: On which grounds?

THE COURT: On the grounds that if this witness has no first-hand
knowledge, it is calling for hearsay.

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, if he was designated an as an expert.

MR. MEDVENE: The court please, Mr. Baker knows we're not supposed to
argue in front of the jury.

THE COURT: Well, his testimony thus far doesn't seem to be based upon
any expertise, but rather than as a percipient witness. So I'll
sustain the objection.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Well, you in your inspection in processing of the
crime scene on June 13, 1994, you walked through the living room and
you found candles burning, correct?

A. I observed some candles burning, yes.

Q. And this was 7:00, 7:15 in the morning of the 13th?

A. No, I first observed them about 4:30, 4:40 in the morning.

Q. Well, you went back through at 6:45, did you not?

A. It was probably after 7:00.

Q. Okay. You think you got back about 6:45, then you did a rewalk
through?

A. Yes.

Q. And then you made the notes that you say you made basically
contemporaneous with your investigation and processing of the crime
scene?

A. With the observations that I'd took; the observations that you read
there.

Q. If it says candles were burning in bedroom and living room, these
notes were made at the 7 o'clock, 7:15 timeframe when you walked
through, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. And in these notes being -- I think it's exhibit 10 -- 2107.

MR. P. BAKER: 2107.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Okay. 2107, which I noted, candles burning in the
room and bathroom. Candles burning in bedroom.

That was at your 7:15 walk-through, right?

A. Approximately.

Q. So those candles had been burning for some at least seven hours?

A. Very large thick candles. The type that do burn for many, many
hours and can be used possibly several times over.

Q. How big were those candles?

A. Approximately three to four inches in diameter.

Q. How many were there when you saw them?

A. Probably in the vicinity of six, seven inches, maybe eight inches.
Some were longer than others; some were shorter.

Q. Did you blow them out?

A. No.

Q. You found that the bed was rumpled but made, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. TV was on, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. And then you did an exterior view of the house, did you not; after
you had gone through the house and you talked about the lighting, did
you not?

A. I did talk about lighting, yes.

Q. And you actually went back to the crime scene on June 23 and made
additional notes, did you not?

A. Yes. That's not uncommon. I've never worked a crime scene that I
haven't returned to.

Q. And then you went back on July 3, 1994 and made additional notes,
correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. Now, there was a -- there was a Malibu light that was right about
at the feet of the body of Nicole Brown, was there not?

Let me have you look at your diagram. I'm sorry, I've got you at a
disadvantage.

(Witness reviews.)

MR. P. BAKER: Exhibit 1439 is on the screen.

(Exhibit 1439 is displayed.)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Have you reviewed that document lately, Mr. Lange?

A. No. In fact, if I may have a moment to orient myself?

Q. Sure, take your time.

A. I have a corresponding sheet that lists what I have on the
schematic. Your question was: There was a Malibu light at the foot --

Q. Approximately.

A. -- Of Nicole Brown.

Q. Approximately by the foot of Nicole Brown Simpson that illuminated
onto the walkway and illuminated the body of Nicole Brown Simpson.

THE COURT: Is that the clearest it gets?

MR. P. BAKER: Yeah.

THE WITNESS: There was a directional light that went straight up over
in this area. That went up, more or less, the numbers up the front.

Now there were four Malibu lights, but there were some that weren't
serviceable and there were none that illuminated the body.

MR. MEDVENE: Excuse me. If the Court please, for the record, Mr.
Baker, could you have the witness please show where he was pointing?

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Show us where you were pointing.

A. The directional light was off to the left. This would be other
photos that -- these are a little blurred -- I have depicted in my
schematic. It's kind of off to the left here in the dirt and it was a
directional light and it went straight up to illuminate the numbers on
the wall. The four Malibu lights, I believe, begin here. There should
be one here.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) On your diagram that Malibu light is labeled C; is
it not?

A. No, sir. The C is the directional and D is the Malibu and it states
it's not working. So that was not working at the time.

Q. And this is the illumination from the lighting in the area of the
Malibu lights?

A. No.

Q. No. That's something totally separate and apart, correct?

A. Yeah. My notes indicate that the Malibu light is not serviceable.
It doesn't work.

Q. And that picture was taken at night, was it not?

A. I believe so.

Q. And you don't know what that circular light that's illuminating --
would appear to be circular -- on the walkway, that's illuminating
that area is, correct?

A. Could you be a little more specific.

Q. Well, it seems maybe --

A. 'Cause I never saw any light illuminating the sidewalk is why I
ask.

Q. This circular area here, that light, is it not, would it -- would
appear to me, it doesn't -- you don't think it is, fine.

A. Again, I'm not an expert in photography or processing of negatives,
but there's a flash effect, and that's a white wall. And I saw no
lights at all illuminating that area, and there were none. So --

Q. Fair enough.

A. So I'm uncomfortable with that.

Q. Fair enough.

Now, you talked about a duffle bag yesterday that you got from Mr.
Simpson on the 17th. Recall that testimony?

A. I believe.

Q. Or a grip?

A. I'd call it a travel bag.

Q. You had -- you had access to that very same travel bag four days
before, hadn't you?

A. Four days before what, sir?

Q. Four days before you took it from Mr. Simpson on the 17th, you had
access to it. And in fact, had it in your police black and white on
the 13th, true?

A. No, sir, false.

Q. Really.

Let me ask you this: Did your partner -- were you in the room when Mr.
Simpson was interrogated by you and Mr. Vannatter?

A. I was.

Q. And that grip was discussed, was it not?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Hearsay, beyond the scope of direct, Your
Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled?

THE WITNESS: I believe it was brought up, yes.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) And your partner, Phil Vannatter, told you he had
that grip in the trunk of his car, didn't he?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Calls for hearsay, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: Mr. Baker, you just said it was in the grip of my car
(sic) and I say it was in the grip -- The grip was in Mr. Vannatter's
car. The fact of the matter is, we don't drive black-and-whites. It
was not in my car. It was brought up by Mr. Vannatter and it was in
Mr. Vannatter's car.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) And I apologize, sir. I'm -- Did you drive down with
Mr. Simpson from his place on the 13th with Mr. Vannatter and the
grip?

A. No, sir.

Q. You didn't come down with them and the grip?

A. I did not.

Q. You came down in a separate vehicle.

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Outside the scope, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled. That's correct.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) And did you have conversation with your partner
relative to the grip that he had taken from Mr. Simpson and inspected?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Assumes facts not in evidence hearsay outside
the scope.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. BAKER: On what grounds, sir, so I can --

MR. MEDVENE: Compound question.

MR. BAKER: Okay.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Did you talk to Phil Vannatter about the content of
the grip on June 13, 1994?

A. No. It was just a comment, I believe, by Vannatter that he had the
grip is all. There was no conversation or anything else.

Q. Well, now, Mr. Simpson was most definitely a suspect on June 13,
1994 when you had him at Parker Center; wasn't he?

A. I'd call him, at that time, certainly a possible suspect, yes.

Q. And you had the grip that he came back from the airplane with, that
was the grip that you talked about; evidence from on the 17th. It was
the very same piece of luggage, wasn't it?

A. I never saw it. All I knew at that time, there was a grip in Mr.
Vannatter's car and I never saw it.

Q. So you and Mr. Vannatter had no conversations about the content of
that bag?

A. I don't believe so.

Q. After the 17th, when you got the grip, did you have conversation
with Mr. Vannatter about the fact that the disguise, the so-called
disguise, was in the grip on the 13th when he looked through the bag?

A. Wouldn't have known that, no.

Q. Well, didn't you have any conversation with him about what was in
the bag that he looked through on the 13th and you testified to
yesterday about the content thereof when you confiscated it on the
17th?

A. Certainly subsequently we went through the bag. We did discuss
those items, that's correct.

Q. And the passport was in the bag on the 13th, was it not?

A. I have no idea.

Q. Well, did you discuss it with Mr. Vannatter, about what the
contents were of this travel bag?

A. The same response. No.

Q. Never discussed it?

A. Not until we went through it and inventoried it.

Q. Now, after you went through it and inventoried it, did you discuss
with Mr. Vannatter the content of that bag when he looked through it
on the 13th?

MR. MEDVENE: Assumes facts not in evidence Your Honor. Also, hearsay.

THE COURT: You may answer yes or no whether you discussed it.

THE WITNESS: I don't believe we did.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) So you have no idea what items were in the bag on
the 13th as contrasted to the 17th, correct?

A. The same response, sir. I didn't look in the bag, had no idea what
was in the bag. I didn't even know what type of a bag.

Q. Now, did you find, in the bag, any shaving kit, any -- for example,
if you're going to travel, you take your shaving kit and you have your
shaver and you have shaving cream and you have a toothbrush and you
have toothpaste. And we usually put those in a kit, in the dock kit
and throw them in the travel bag.

Anything like that in there?

A. I don't recall specifically a shaving kit. And again, I probably
haven't reviewed this, the specific content in close to a year and a
half or so. If you could show me a property report, I'd be glad to
tell you what was on there.

Q. Did you find any prescription medication in the travel bag? Do you
have any recollection of that?

A. There was prescription medication in the name of someone else other
than Mr. Simpson in there.

Q. You were looking for a weapon when you took that bag, were you not?

A. No.

Q. You were looking for bloody clothing when you took that bag, were
you not?

A. Not specifically.

Q. You were looking for bloody shoes when you took that bag, were you
not?

A. No, not specifically.

Q. The reason you wanted to confiscate that grip is because you
believe Mr. Simpson was the murderer and you believe that evidence of
the murder would be in that grip, true or untrue?

A. Which day are you speaking of?

Q. The 17th, sir?

A. Certainly he was under arrest for murder and he definitely was a
suspect. In our minds, if he did in fact commit those murders, we
believed there was a possibility that there -- that was evidence, we
certainly do want to look into it, yes.

Q. And you were looking for the bloody clothes, bloody shoes and the
murder weapon in that grip, correct?

A. Not specifically. We'd been looking for anything that might tend to
connect him to that crime.

Q. Did you send, at your direction, Ottis Marlow into the sewers
between the Rockingham estate of Mr. Simpson and Bundy to try to find
bloody clothes, bloody shoes and murder weapon?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, Your Honor. Beyond the scope.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You never found any bloody clothes, any murder
weapon or bloody shoes, ever, did you?

A. No, I didn't.

Q. And it wasn't because you didn't look and have other people look in
Los Angeles as far away as Chicago, true?

A. Well, there were other reasons but there were places that we
looked.

Q. Can you answer my question, Mr. Lange?

A. I'm trying to do that, sir. I'm trying to do it honestly.

Q. You can answer yes or no.

A. And I'm trying to do it accurately.

Q. You can answer yes or no.

THE COURT: Just a minute. Let's not have a -- Ask your question again,
Mr. Baker.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You looked for bloody clothes, bloody shoes and a
murder weapon as far as Chicago and never found any; isn't that true?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Outside the scope, Your Honor.

THE COURT: You may answer yes or no.

THE WITNESS: That's true.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now as I understood your testimony, relative to the
-- relative to the back gate, well --

THE COURT: Are we going to get to a different area right now?

MR. BAKER: Yes.

THE COURT: Let's take ten.

(Recess.)

(Jurors resume their respective seats.)

(The following proceedings were held in open court, in the presence of
the jury.)

THE COURT: Counsel?

(The following proceedings were held at the bench, with the reporter.)

MR. PETROCELLI: More notes?

THE COURT: No, this one is not bad. This one, the juror is concerned
with terminology you're using. Counsel, somebody, has been using the
term "transfer evidence," and they're confused.

MR. MEDVENE: Maybe transferred?

MR. PETROCELLI: "Transfer evidence" is the word they're confused
about.

MR. BAKER: I don't know.

THE COURT: You might clear it up.

MR. BAKER: "Trace evidence."

MR. PETROCELLI: The witness said "transfer."

THE COURT: Okay.

(The following proceedings were held in open court, in the presence of
the jury.)

THE COURT: Oh, I think I know what it was; it's transfer of blood onto
the top of the rail, that type of a transfer evidence was the
reference.

MR. BAKER: Okay. I'll go back to that in a minute, if I may. THOMAS
LANGE, the witness on the stand at the time of the recess, having been
previously duly sworn, was examined and testified further as follows:
CROSS-EXAMINATION (Continued) BY MR. BAKER:

Q. Now, Mr. Lange, relative to the -- to what you suggested yesterday,
that you got out of the duffel bag or grip bag of Mr. Simpson, that
was all inventoried pursuant to police procedure, was it not?

A. Yeah, that's a fair statement.

Q. In other words, as a long-time police officer, you certainly
recognize the duty and obligation to inventory every piece of evidence
that you collect, especially if it's the property of someone like Mr.
Simpson, or any citizen, correct?

A. Yeah. But, you know, initially you don't know what you have.
There's evidence gets booked at evidence and there's sometimes
property that is, as you say, booked as personal property. But I would
expect you to be thorough, yes.

Q. And you would expect yourself to be thorough in booking the
evidence and making an accurate property report, especially if you're
going to get on the witness stand and testify, as you did yesterday,
about certain sets of keys coming from Mr. Simpson's duffel bag,
right?

A. I would hope so. But sometimes mistakes are made, omissions,
because you don't recall.

Q. And whether it be evidence inventory or personal property
inventory, you believe it should be done accurately and correctly,
true?

A. That would be preferable. It doesn't always happen, but that would
be preferable, certainly.

Q. If, in fact, there's no inventory to an item, you can't testify as
to where it came from, correct? For example, you testified yesterday
about some keys that have some pendant on them, Smokey, or something
like that?

A. I did.

Q. And you say they came from the duffel bag the grip, travel bag;
that is, you say you got them on the 17th, after Mr. Simpson was
arrested?

A. No, I didn't say I got them on the 17th. I said it was subsequent
to that. I believe it was sometime later that we went through that
duffel bag; it wasn't on the 17th.

Q. In any event, the property that was removed from the 1993 Bronco,
in the two-door white Ford Bronco, license number DDHY 503, the duffel
bag we're talking about, that's what came out of Mr. Cowlings' Bronco,
correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And the personal property report, did you inventory that, or did
Mr. Vannatter inventory that?

A. I'd have to take a look at it.

Q. Well, do you have any personal knowledge of any of the items that
you testified to yesterday coming out of that travel bag?

That is, did you take them out?

Did you inventory them?

And as you testified yesterday, they came out of the duffel bag,
right?

A. There were several persons present from the D.A.'s office.

Q. Maybe you didn't understand my question. Maybe you didn't
understand my question.

My question is: You -- did you have personal knowledge of the -- what
came out of the duffel bag?

A. My recollection is that these items did come out of the duffel bag.

Q. I didn't ask you is it your recollection.

Did you see them come out of the duffel bag, and did you take them out
of the duffel bag, one or the other?

A. That's my recollection.

Q. Okay.

Okay. You are aware, certainly, that the keys that you testified to
yesterday were in the duffel bag, and you saw them come out of the
duffel bag, and they would be listed on the personal property report,
right?

A. I don't know if they would be. It seems to me that they did -- if
you can show me where I'm mistaken, fine; but my recollection is that
they came out of the duffel bag.

Q. And if they weren't listed on the personal property report, the
personal property report for that duffel bag, you would agree that
they could come from anyplace?

A. No.

Q. Because you didn't have a recollection just a minute -- you don't
have a recollection, as you sit here now, in seeing any keys come out
of the duffel bag; isn't that true, sir?

A. No. You've misstated what I've said.

Q. You can answer yes or no.

MR. MEDVENE: If the Court please --

MR. BAKER: I'm not stating anything.

MR. MEDVENE: The witness is trying to answer the question.

THE COURT: Answer the question, please.

THE WITNESS: Well, you have misstated my statement.

MR. BAKER: I move to strike this witness's commentary and request the
Court to direct Mr. Lange to listen to the question and answer my
question.

THE COURT: Well, answer the question.

THE WITNESS: Would you repeat the question.

(The reporter read the pending question as follows:) "Q. Because you
didn't have a recollection just a minute -- you don't have a
recollection, as you sit here now, in seeing any keys come out of the
duffel bag; isn't that true, sir?"

THE WITNESS: Again, my recollection is that they came out of the
duffel bag. I may be mistaken. And perhaps you can show me where I'm
mistaken -- and if I'm mistaken. That is my recollection, as I sit
here today.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Did you review the personal property report in this
case?

A. No.

Again, I asked you a few minutes ago if I could. I don't believe I've
seen that a second time.

Q. You have spent 20 hours reviewing this case, Mr. Lange.

Did you review your own notes relative to your investigation of the
crime scene and the 20 hours you spent with the plaintiffs' attorneys
here?

A. My notes, yes, but not someone else's report on another
investigation. That's what you have here.

Q. But you did review 2107 in detail, because these are your notes,
correct?

A. What's 2107?

Q. Your notes.

A. I have gone over the notes, yes.

Q. And did you see on the personal property report, anything
indicating the keys that you talked about yesterday?

MR. MEDVENE: If the Court please, 2107 is not the personal property
report. Can we have the number of the personal property report, which
is what's being asked about now?

MR. BAKER: Is it on the back?

I don't know if it's on the back.

MR. MEDVENE: Also object on the basis of lack of foundation. Your
Honor, it's not the witness's report, as I understand what he said.

MR. BAKER: Can we get a number for the personal property report?

THE CLERK: A new exhibit?

THE COURT: Yes.

THE CLERK: 2108.

MR. BAKER: New --

(The instrument herein referred to as Personal property report of
property of O. J. Simpson was marked for identification as Defendants'
Exhibit No. 2108.)

THE COURT: What is the question?

MR. BAKER: The question is:

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) That's the personal property report for the items in
the duffel bag, is it not, sir?

A. I didn't write this report and didn't have to review --

Q. I didn't ask you if you wrote the report; I asked you if it is the
report.

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Foundation.

THE WITNESS: Can I look at it and read it?

MR. MEDVENE: Of course you can.

THE COURT: Overruled.

(Pause in proceedings.)

THE WITNESS: I don't see any keys on here. There's no way of telling
whether this is the entire report.

I'll stick with, my recollection is that the keys --

THE COURT: No, no. The question is, is that the personal property
report. That's a yes or no.

THE WITNESS: This is a report --

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) And --

A. -- property report listing items from the duffel bag; that's
correct.

Q. And the keys are not on there?

A. I don't see them on there.

Q. Thank you.

MR. BAKER: Now, put up -- put up that photo of, please, Phil -- what's
the name of that?

MR. P. BAKER: 2046.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) I want to go back.

I found a little better photo. I want to ask you a couple questions
about the hat and see if you can see how much -- and it may not be any
better because of the monitor -- but can you tell us from -- this is
the pole that anchors the gate, is it not, where I'm pointing with my
finger?

And we have a blood smear down on the side?

A. I believe it is. I -- well, I think it is. If I could see it from
another angle -- but it appears to be.

Q. Okay. Let me show you the photo, because it's more clear in the
actual photo.

MR. PETROCELLI: Your Honor, can we have an exhibit number? Didn't
appear in the joint trial statement.

MR. BAKER: 2146.

MR. PETROCELLI: No, there's a different item on that joint trial
statement for that number.

MR. P. BAKER: 89.

MR. BAKER: Would you believe 89?

MR. PETROCELLI: It's what the statement says.

MR. BAKER: Okay.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Let me put Exhibit 89 before you. And it's a little
easier to see than on the monitor.

A. Yes, that appears to be that support pole for the rung, yes.

Q. And the knit cap in that photo would appear to be beyond the
horizontal rung, which is at least what, two, two and a half inches in
diameter?

A. See the perpendicular rung with the horizontal from this angle;
it's a little hard to tell by looking at this. I suppose it's possible
that part of it is.

Q. And certainly, the part of the cap that's under the horizontal
rung, the cap couldn't have dropped into that position; you would at
least agree to that?

A. Could have been kicked during the scuffle.

Q. Maybe you didn't understand the question, Mr. Lange.

I said, you would agree that the cap could not have been dropped into
that position? True?

A. No, not necessarily.

Q. So if it were just dropped, normally, it would come down, would it
not?

A. Unless someone kicked it while it was being dropped. You know, I --

Q. Okay.

A. -- I have no idea how it got in that position.

Q. All right. And so the absence of any debris, any dirt on the cap,
would indicate to you, then, that the cap was kicked in mid-air and
projected under the fence a couple of inches, right.

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Assumes a fact not in evidence.

THE COURT: Speculative. Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) If it were kicked because you had been in the area
--

You may resume your seat.

If it had been kicked -- because you've been in the area and you've
certainly seen the dirt on the shoes of Mr. Goldman, you would
anticipate that there would be dirt on the cap from being kicked into
that position, would you not?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Calls for speculation --

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. MEDVENE: -- conclusion, lack of foundation.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You would agree with your -- from your review of
that photograph, that there doesn't appear to be any dirt that was
transferred from a shoe to the knit cap, correct?

MR. MEDVENE: Same objection, Your Honor. Also, lack of foundation.

THE COURT: Foundation, sustained.

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, may I be heard on that?

THE COURT: All right.

MR. BAKER: Thank you.

(The following proceedings were held at the bench, with the reporter.)

MR. BAKER: They have elicited testimony from this witness that he is
an expert. They've talked about trailing of blood, which is an expert
concept. They said the blood trailed at -- one of the blood drops in
the walkway, they said that blood -- he said the blood on the back
trailed Nicole Brown Simpson.

He's talked about -- he's become an expert on candle burning, and has
talked about that.

He goes in and out of his expert mode as he chooses, in my view. But
in any event, he certainly has testified as an expert in his detecting
work in this case, pursuant to the questions asked by Mr. Medvene.

THE COURT: Well, I think the question calls for expertise on
drop-kicking a hat. I don't think that that covers that area of
expertise.

Sustain the objection.

(The following proceedings were held in open court, in the presence of
the jury.)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, you didn't, in looking at the photograph that's
on the monitor presently -- that's 89 -- you didn't see any evidence
of any dirt transfer from a shoe or anything else on the cap, correct?

A. I can't tell, because I just saw certain portions of the cap. I
didn't specifically look for those types of things.

Q. In any event, you saw no evidence of it, regardless of your -- and
you see no evidence of it in that picture, do you?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, Your Honor. Asked and answered, lack of
foundation.

THE COURT: You may answer whether you see any evidence of it in that
picture.

THE WITNESS: Any evidence of?

MR. BAKER: Transfer of his shoe to a cap.

THE COURT: I think the question was from any source.

THE WITNESS: Well, I do see evidence of something transferred, but
that's --

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You see particulate matter at about the 1 o'clock
position?

A. One -- if I could see that other photo, I could possibly see
particulate -- that's a little bit better.

Seems to me I did see some particles on that cap, if that's the
question. Yes, I observed particles all over the cap.

Q. There's particles all over the cap in that picture in your view,
right?

A. Particles?

Q. Particles all over the blood in your view in that picture, right?

A. Well, I can't see from this picture any particles on the glove.

There's possibly one here. But there appears to be little, tiny
particles on the cap.

Q. Nothing --

A. If that's --

Q. Nothing consistent with the amount of dirt that you saw on the
boots of Mr. Goldman, correct?

A. Consistent with?

Q. Consistent with --

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, Your Honor. Vague and ambiguous, calls for a
conclusion, speculative, lack of foundation.

THE COURT: Overruled on all those grounds.

THE WITNESS: I don't --

MR. MEDVENE: I didn't pick the right ground.

MR. KELLY: Argumentative.

MR. MEDVENE: It is also.

MR. BAKER: It's not that good a question; don't worry about it.

(Laughter.)

THE WITNESS: I'm sure I don't understand the question.

MR. BAKER: See?

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You don't see any copious amounts of dirt on either
of those articles, do you?

MR. MEDVENE: The question is argumentative, Your Honor. Object on that
ground.

MR. BAKER: Did you answer the question?

THE COURT: I'm trying to read the question.

MR. BAKER: Sorry.

(The reporter read the pending question as follows: "Q. You don't see
any copious amounts of dirt on either of those articles, do you?"

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: Not from this angle, no.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You never saw it from any angle, large amounts of
debris, dirt, or anything on either of those items; isn't that true?

A. I didn't look.

Q. So, in your investigation, these two pieces of physical evidence
that are basically right together, one projecting underneath the
horizontal bar of the fence, you did not look at; is that your
testimony?

A. No. I looked at the items, obviously, but I did not pick them up to
examine them. That's the job of the criminalist. And I wouldn't do
that because I could contaminate it.

Q. All right. Now, on that photograph, there is blood transfer on the
pole, is there not?

A. Appears to be, yes.

Q. And could you just point to where the blood transfer on the pole
is.

(Witness complies.)

A. Appears to be a transfer in that area right here. (Indicating.)

Q. Now, blood transfer, sir, occurs when someone is bleeding, for
example from a cut, and comes in contact with a particular item, in
this case a pole, correct?

A. That's my understanding.

Q. And that particular transfer is right on the pole, the vertical
pole that supports the gate, correct? Or I guess -- yeah, the --

A. Perpendicular corner pole, this one right here?

Q. Yes.

Now, that particular blood smear is about and an inch or so off of the
tile walkway there.

We've got it blown up a pretty good size.

A. I really -- to me, it's grainy, and it's very blurred. I would do a
lot better with that photograph; I'm sorry.

MR. BAKER: Do we have another one of those so we can have one of
these?

Let me let you look at this again.

(Witness reviews photo.)

THE WITNESS: May I have the question again, please.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You certainly may.

The smear is about one inch up from the tile, is it not?

A. Appears to be, yes.

Q. And that is not a blood drop; that has -- in your opinion, that has
become more vertical; that is, in fact, a smear, is it not?

A. Well, the problem with that is, it could have at one time have been
a drop and then gotten smeared, so I really can't tell. But it appears
to be something that's smeared.

Now, I don't know how it smeared down -- I don't know how the blood
got on the pole.

Q. In the terms of blood-stain analysis, if a drop is a vertical drop,
it usually comes out and is fairly circular in nature?

A. If it's a from a 90-degree source that's not moving, yes.

Q. And in terms of a blood smear, that is a transfer of blood -- if I
had a cut on the back of my hand and I pushed upon this piece of
paper, you would consider that a smear, would you not, if it was an
open cut and bleeding?

A. I don't know if you had a cut I would call it a smear, perhaps a
transfer, because I wouldn't know exactly how that happened, a smear
versus a swipe. I'd possibly call it a transfer.

Q. Well, let's -- can we then use the term "blood transfer" to include
both smear and swipe?

A. Sure, sure.

Q. And you would agree that what's on that pole is a blood transfer;
that is, it's either a smear or a swipe, correct?

A. Well, it could have been a drop at one time and then gotten
smeared.

I need to qualify that.

Q. What you see in that photograph which was taken on June 13, 1994 at
the crime scene, is a blood transfer, that being a smear or a swipe,
true?

A. Possibly.

Q. Well, in your opinion, is it or isn't it?

A. I can't tell you my opinion because I didn't see it deposited. I've
given you two possible scenarios and my opinion of this, how this
blood might have gotten there.

Q. Let's just back up for a minute. You may assume your seat if you
like, sir.

The crime scene is allegedly secured at 12:30, when the LAPD gets
their officers there and they yellow-tape it, right?

A. It's secured, yes.

Q. And what's supposed to happen is that no one is supposed to go in
and contaminate the crime scene, correct?

A. Certainly, no intentional contamination, obviously.

Q. And no one would go -- be walking up the walkway where blood has
come down the walkway, true?

A. I would hope not.

Q. And no one would be over at the vertical support for the gate on
the right-hand side of the walkway?

A. Not necessarily.

I don't understand your question --

Q. Well --

A. -- or is that a statement?

MR. BAKER: The actual picture with the foliage, if I may.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You would agree as a general proposition, that
certainly, the Los Angeles Police Department would not be attempting
to turn a blood drop into a blood smear. I mean, they would -- you
would be trying to ensure that the integrity of the physical evidence
is kept intact at a crime scene; isn't that true?

A. That's correct.

Q. And you would -- those pictures were taken at sometime, I want you
to assume, between 3:00 and 6:00 in the morning, okay?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, Your Honor. Lack of foundation.

MR. BAKER: Asking him to assume.

THE COURT: Hypothetical. Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) We've heard testimony that police officers and
detectives went up the south foliage when they were going up to the
crime scene, and stayed away from the north side.

That would be consistent with what you saw at the time that you were
there, true?

A. Well, initially, before they entered the crime scene to do their
work, yes.

Q. And the pictures that document evidence are to document the
evidence so that there can be, as much as possible, a reconstruction
of the event that occurred causing the criminal act, true?

A. We want to do that, yes.

Q. And what you don't want to do, of course, is, you don't want to
turn a droplet into a smear, because that may have some significance
in terms of reconstruction of the scene, true?

A. Certainly.

Q. And in fact, where that pole is located, which would be on the
right side of the walkway as we look at the monitor --

MR. BAKER: And that's exhibit what, Phil?

MR. P. BAKER: 1439.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) 1439. That is an area that, the whole time you were
there, nobody was walking over by that area, true?

A. No, there were people. There were coroners, investigators,
criminalists, myself.

Q. The coroner didn't get there until after 9:00. The criminalist
didn't get there until after 10:00, true?

A. If I -- is there a specific time here that you're referring to?

Q. Yeah. I said that picture, I want you to assume, was taken between
3:00 and 6:00 in the morning. There would be nobody there turning a
blood droplet into a swipe or a smear, true?

A. I would hope not.

Q. And that blood smear is within one inch or so from the tile,
correct?

A. Appears that way.

Q. There wasn't anything that matched that on Mr. Goldman's boots, was
there?

A. That matched what?

Q. That matched a blood transfer an inch above ground level.

A. I'm sorry, I don't understand that question. A blood transfer here
that matched something on Mr. Goldman's boot?

Q. Well, that blood transfer had to come from someplace, didn't it?

A. Well, certainly, yes.

Q. It had to come from a bleeding wound, didn't it?

A. Yes.

Q. And it had to come from a bleeding wound that was an inch or so off
the ground, didn't it?

A. No.

Q. It was not in an area where Nicole Brown Simpson was, was it?

A. It certainly is.

Q. Nicole Brown Simpson, in your opinion, was not knocked out before
she was killed; isn't that true?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Beyond the scope, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. BY MR. BAKER: Let me look at your notes. You indicated on your
notes that Ms. Brown had no shoes on, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. And she had no dirt on her feet, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. Indicating she wasn't in the dirt area, true?

A. More than likely.

Q. Correct? I'm sorry.

A. I would say more than likely that's pretty evident.

Q. And your opinion was that she was knocked out basically in the
position that she ended up when she was found at 0010 in the morning,
true?

A. That's what the evidence shows us, yes.

Q. So her blood didn't transfer across the walkway into the vertical
pole, did it?

A. Yes, it did.

Q. Oh, you think it did?

A. I know it did. In that vicinity, I don't know what that blood is on
that pole without an analysis.

Q. If it transfered, it wouldn't be a smear. It would be drops as
contrasted to a swipe or a smear, true?

A. That's what I said earlier, yes, true.

Q. And there is no indication of how that blood smeared on that
vertical pole, is there, in the evidence that you viewed?

A. No. We can't tell how that happened. Of course, not.

Q. And that could have been the perpetrators of the crime, correct,
bleeding at that area; true?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Calls for speculation.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. BY MR. BAKER: Now, did you, in the back alleyway of 875, did you
see a pendant back there, Mr. Lange?

A. Yes.

MR. BAKER: Want to put that up. What number is that, please?

MR. P. BAKER: 859.

(Exhibit 859 is displayed.)

(The instrument herein described as photo of blue plastic heart was
marked for identification as Defendants' Exhibit No. 859.)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Where was that?

A. The pendant was in the -- approximately the driveway area, I
believe, adjacent to the garage door.

Q. Now, when was that item -- strike that.

That was an item of evidence?

A. It was ultimately booked evidence. It wasn't initially, but
ultimately I did book it.

Q. Well, it was -- that's the ruler of Mr. Rokahr, the photographer,
that he put down beside that, done on June 13, 1994?

A. That's correct.

Q. That item was booked as evidence August 26, 1994, ten weeks later?

A. Yes.

Q. What happened to it between the 13th and the 26th, Mr. Lange?

A. I collected it, Mr. Baker. It was in my --

Q. What did you do with it?

A. -- It was in my desk drawer for that amount of time.

Q. It was in your desk drawer?

A. Yes.

Q. For ten weeks.

MR. MEDVENE: Objection.

THE WITNESS: Yes.

MR. MEDVENE: Argumentative, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: Would you like me to explain, Mr. Baker?

Q. BY MR. BAKER: Now, did you, personally, take any other evidence and
have it in your custody and control without booking it?

A. I'm not aware of any evidence that wasn't booked.

Q. Well, you're suppose to book things as soon as practical, true?

A. That's the key word, "practical." It was not practical to book this
item at that particular time.

Q. It wasn't practical to book that piece of evidence for ten weeks
while it sat in your drawer?

A. That's correct.

Q. Okay. So your drawer, and in the area where you can book evidence,
what is it; two floors away?

A. More like two miles.

Q. So couldn't book it for the ten weeks?

A. No. It's not that I couldn't.

Q. Okay.

A. I didn't want to. I specifically withheld that particular item for
a purpose.

Q. Oh, okay. Did you with hold any other evidence, Mr. Lange?

A. No.

Q. And how about the tennis shoes, did you take those home for my
particular reason instead of booking those in the night of the 13th?

A. They couldn't have been booked on the night of the 13th because the
ECU is closed and the criminalist left.

I did, in fact, take them home with me instead of taking them all the
way downtown just to find a closed evidence control unit.

Q. So that was okay as far as you were concerned?

A. It was on order by my commanding officer. It was the common sense
thing to do and the ECU is closed. I wouldn't -- couldn't have booked
it if I wanted to book it.

Q. It was okay, as far as you were concerned, to put the tennis shoes
-- where did you put them, in the inside of your car or the trunk?

A. Initially when I left I put them inside the vehicle. When I
returned home, I locked them in the back of the vehicle in the trunk
and they were in a cardboard box.

MR. BAKER: Now, did Phil put up the triangular paper?

MR. P. BAKER: Excuse me?

MR. BAKER: No. The triangular paper?

(Mr. P. Baker complies, displays item.)

MR. P. BAKER: 1532.

(The instrument herein described as a triangular piece of paper found
at Bundy scene was marked for identification as Defendants' Exhibit
No. 1532.)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) That piece of paper was observed by you at the crime
scene on June 13, 1994, true?

A. That's correct.

Q. And that piece of paper has blood pattern evidence on it, correct?

A. That's possibly open to interpretation.

Q. Well -- well, Mr. Lange, why don't you give us yours, does it or
doesn't it?

A. Surely, there's a flow of blood on there if you were to interpret
that as something.

Again, this is why we take these types of photographs. I don't see
anything in particular.

Later on, subsequently to this, there were three small lines, I
believe, observed on this piece of paper. It was looked at by our
experts, by our footprint expert, our shoe print expert and our fiber
expert. And it was the belief of those individuals that it was not a
shoe impression but perhaps a fiber impression of some type.

MR. BAKER: Move to strike as nonresponsive, Your Honor. The question
was, to this witness, whether he had an opinion as to whether that was
blood pattern evidence.

THE COURT: Sustained. Stricken.

MR. BAKER: Can he answer the question?

MR. MEDVENE: Excuse me. The witness said he had an opinion. It's based
on what experts advised him. Mr. Baker's question was broad. It's not
where did he get the opinion, but did he have one.

THE COURT: Okay. If you have one, yes or no?

THE WITNESS: I formed an opinion, yes.

Q. BY MR. BAKER: Did you have an opinion on the night of June 13,
1994, that that piece of paper contained blood pattern evidence?

A. No. I never examined it on that night nor that morning.

Q. And did you direct anyone to pick up that piece of paper?

A. No, I directed it to be photographed at a crime scene. You don't
necessarily always pick up every scrap of paper that's there.
Especially something like this, that had been there obviously for some
time. Generally at a crime scene, you're going to look for something
that was introduced by the suspect or as a consequence of the crime.

In this particular instance, there were other scraps of paper. There
were bits and pieces of rawhide, dog bone. There were leaves, berries,
and just not going to pick everything up.

You're going to examine it. You're going to document it, certainly,
out of an abundance of caution. And you're going to photograph it.
You're going to orient it and photograph it, as in this case, up close
to identify it. But you're not always going to pick up everything.
This piece of paper was weathered. And in my mind, it had been there
for some time.

Q. I take it, from your testimony just now, sir, that you personally
have made the decision that this was probably not a piece of evidence
that was significant and therefore need not be collected, true?

A. No. If I didn't think it was significance, we wouldn't have gone to
the lengths that we did to identify this piece of paper. This piece of
paper was not as a consequence of the crime or induced during the
crime in my opinion.

Q. Oh?

A. I did not direct the criminalist to pick it up. If he had, it
wouldn't have mattered but there were many other items that weren't
picked up too for the same reason.

Q. So let me see if I understand it.

You made the decision there June 13, 1994, that this piece of paper
was not introduced at the time the crime took place, correct?

A. That's my opinion, it was then and it is now.

Q. I see. And you don't know whether there are any fingerprints on it
'cause you didn't collect it, right.

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Collection. And we're way beyond the scope.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. BY MR. BAKER: Blood pattern evidence can show shoe prints, can it
not?

MR. MEDVENE: Same objection, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Excuse me?

MR. MEDVENE: Same Objection, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Blood pattern evidence could show shoe prints. Overruled. I
don't know that.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You don't know that.

A. Regardless, that's why we take these identifying photographs so
that someone, if need be, can look at it at a later date.

Q. And you think that the photograph is probably as good as the actual
physical evidence; that you can look at and put under, for example, a
binocular microscope?

A. No, I didn't say that.

Q. You should have picked it up, shouldn't you?

A. Not necessarily, no.

Q. I didn't say --

A. It's become a contention point, Mr. Baker. I wish I had. I wish I
directed that that be picked up, but only for one reason; because it's
become a contention point, not because it's a piece of crucial
evidence or a piece of evidence at all, which it is not.

MR. BAKER: Move to strike as nonresponsive.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. BY MR. BAKER: Now, do we have a picture of that?

That piece of totally uncrucial evidence was between the bodies of the
victims of a double homicide; was it not?

A. On the way, that's correct.

Q. And it was within ten inches of the body of Nicole Brown Simpson?

A. I don't know, possibly.

Q. What picture is that?

MR. P. BAKER: 92.

THE COURT: It's a triangular piece of paper that we have on the
monitor, exhibit 92, is right where I'm pointing; is it not?

THE WITNESS: Yes, it is.

(The instrument herein referred to as a Picture of a triangular piece
of paper was marked for identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 92.)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Right where there is a copious amount of blood,
true?

A. There's blood all over, yes.

Q. Right where there are shoe prints, correct?

A. There are shoe prints that are above that location, yes.

Q. And below that location?

A. Yes.

Q. Correct?

A. Appears to be.

Q. You never picked up the piece of paper to determine what was on the
other side of it either, did you?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, collection, this line, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. BY MR. BAKER: By the way, did you wear booties at any time when you
were at Bundy; when you went to Rockingham or when you came back to
Bundy?

A. I've never worn booties on any crime scene and never heard of a
detective doing that.

Q. Why? Is it too unmacho?

A. No.

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Argumentative.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, you're saying that you made the decision at the
crime scene, June 13, 1994, that that piece of paper between the
envelope and the body of Nicole Brown Simpson was just irrelevant?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, Your Honor. Misstates the testimony. Asked and
answered several times.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) And you say, based upon your -- Did you go up and
look at it so you could tell if it was weathered, Mr. Lange?

A. I certainly did age, also documented it and I made sure it was
photographed both at a distance for orientation purposes, and up close
for identification purposes.

Q. In your view that it was appropriate, now, the picture that is on
the board presently on the monitor --

MR. P. BAKER: 92.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Were you present when that picture was taken?

A. I don't believe so.

Q. Were you present when the picture, the close-up I just put up on
the board --

MR. BAKER: Which is what?

MR. P. BAKER: 1532.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Were you present when that picture was taken, or
were you over at Rockingham?

A. No. I believe I was in the area.

Q. It's your testimony that you directed Mr. Rokahr, the LAPD
photographer, to take that picture?

A. I don't see that. I did order close-up photos of various items at
the scene and I believe that to be one of them.

Q. And that was one of the items that you ordered a close-up photo?

A. Well --

Q. You're sure about that as you testified?

A. Specifically I can't say yes.

I can say in a general sense that we do take orientation shots and we
do take identification shots of all evidence when we're at a crime
scene. We don't specifically point out A,B,C.

We ask the photographer, especially an experienced photographer, to
start shooting the evidence while we do other things. Many things are
happening at the same time.

Q. My question was unclear. Let me see if I can rephrase it.

Did you, personally, order any photograph of the piece of paper that
is now on the TV monitor in Exhibit 1542 (sic)?

A. Same answer: In a general sense, yes.

Q. So specifically, the answer is no, correct?

A. Specifically, I can't say because there were specific instructions
on specific items. This was not foremost in my mind then. It's not
foremost in my mind now. This, as evidence -- there were many other
things that preceded that.

THE CLERK: For the record, it's exhibit 1532.

MR. BAKER: That's as close as I get, 1532. I apologize.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, did you direct Rokahr, the LAPD photographer,
to take any pictures of -- for example, was there a menu about the
crime scene that you observed on June 13, 1994?

A. There was a mailer, a common mailer that had been through the
neighborhood, through all the residences in the area, yes.

There was a follow-up done on that mailer that had been delivered to
all of the homes in the neighborhood.

Q. Well, on June 13, 1994, you didn't know whether that mailer had
gone anywhere, true?

A. That's true.

Q. Did you have, did you direct Rolf Rokahr to take a pictures of
that, sir?

A. Again, there was a general request to photograph various things. I
haven't reviewed those photos in some time. That photograph may have
been taken as an orientation photograph early on. I don't know, I'd
have to look at it.

Q. But certainly that would be a piece of evidence that you would at
least want documented by a photo, true. That is --

A. Certainly.

Q. That this is this?

A. And possibly writing also.

Q. And there should be a photograph of that?

A. I would hope that there would be, yes.

Q. And it would be improper procedure if there wasn't, correct?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Relevance, materiality, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, every blood drop that you located on June 13,
1994 was photographed in a close-up mode, correct?

A. No.

Q. Well, on the --

A. If you're speaking just specifically of the five drops on the
walkway, that's correct. There were dozens that were not photographed
that closely.

Q. Well, there were the blood drops that you say you saw on June 13,
1994 in the various locations on the walkway that was outside of the
actual closed-in area in the walkway where the victims bodies were
found, true?

A. That's what I said.

Q. And, so, as we go east to west, we have item 112, then we have item
11 -- or item 112. And that would be, if one was walking east to west,
that would be to their left side, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And the item No. 113, that's basically in the center; is it not?

That's not left or right if someone is walking from east to west,
correct?

A. No. I believe it is on the left side of the shoe print if you were
to observe an overall photograph.

Q. And item No. 114, that's not on the left; is it?

A. It is to the left of the shoe prints, yes.

Q. There are shoe prints where 114 is? You sure of that?

A. Well, on that schematic I believe there are prints not directly
adjacent to, but to the right of, and in the vicinity of that blood
drop.

Q. And 115, that, you believe, that's also -- that's also on the left?

A. No, 115, there weren't any shoe prints observed back at 115.

Q. And 117, that's about what foot from the wall?

If someone was still walking east to west, that wouldn't be on their
left, would it?

A. I can't -- I couldn't say.

Q. Well, so that all of the blood print, blood spots or stains that
were out of the crime area were photographed, both to show perspective
and close-up, that's what you testified to yesterday, right?

A. That's correct.

Q. And then as you go up to the back gate, and you get to the back
gate, there is no photograph of any blood spots and no cards, right?

A. That's certainly correct.

Q. But these blood spots, you have no doubt, as you sit here today
that they were, in fact, there on June 13, 1994; and it just was
serendipity that they weren't collected until you were out at the
crime scene on July 3, 1994, right.

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Question's argumentative as to the form that
it was stated; the word "serendipity."

THE COURT: I'll sustain serendipity as inappropriate. The rest of the
question may remain.

MR. BAKER: Answer the question without the word serendipity?

THE WITNESS: Would you repeat the question?

MR. BAKER: You please read it without the word serendipity in it?

MR. MEDVENE: Excuse me, it's not just that word, Mr. Baker, the
question's also vague and ambiguous in terms of what blood drops we're
about on the gate or other blood drops.

THE COURT: I think it was clear. Overruled.

MR. BAKER: Let me just ask you the question.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) It was just happenstance that the blood on the back
gate was not photographed in close-up; that the blood on the back gate
was not collected on June 13. And you have no doubt, of course, that
it was there on June 13, although you requested a criminalist to
collect it on July 3, 1994, right?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, Your Honor. Compound, about four questions.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: I wouldn't call that happenstance. I wouldn't call it
carelessness.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) But these weren't additional blood drops. They were
there on June 13, 1994, right?

A. They were.

Q. And you wouldn't put in your written or the additional blood drops
because they weren't additional blood drops. They were there on June
13, 1994, right?

A. I observed blood on that gate on June 13, that's correct.

Q. You wouldn't put additional blood drops as you, in fact put in
there on June 13, 1994. Why don't you read to the jury what you said
on that?

MR. MEDVENE: Excuse me, your honor, there's no need for Mr. Baker to
behave like that, throw the exhibit at the witness.

MR. BAKER: I don't need --

THE COURT: Excuse me.

MR. BAKER: -- An etiquette lesson from Mr. Medvene.

THE COURT: Mr. Medvene, would you sit down. Mr. Baker.

MR. BAKER: I apologize.

THE COURT: Thank you.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Read to the jury what you wrote on June 13, 19 --
Strike that July 3, some three weeks later about the blood drops on
the back gate, Mr. Lange?

A. I've got a log here and I've got everyone who was there and I'd put
down.

Q. Just read what the additional blood drops --

MR. MEDVENE: I'd ask that he not interrupt him.

THE COURT: Mr. Medvene, we might get this thing done if you wouldn't
keep interrupting each other and the witness. Please answer the
question.

THE WITNESS: Certainly. Additional blood droplets, located rear gate,
north west. Collected by criminalist on July 3.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) And that was, sir, the blood drops, these were
additional blood drops from the 13th, right?

A. That was done additionally on July 3.

Q. No, you said additional blood drops. You didn't say it was done
additionally; isn't that true, sir?

A. That's what it says.

Q. Now, the --.

MR. P. BAKER: 719.

(Exhibit 719 is displayed.)

MR. BAKER: I should have taken that down. I'll probably hurt somebody
if I put it back up.

(Referring to large exhibit.)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) This picture is the far away view that was taken on
June 13, 1994, correct?

A. It is.

Q. And all of the blood drops that you saw and documented and had
collected on July 3, 1994, they're all there, right?

A. All of the blood drops --

Q. Sure.

A. -- I observed on July 3?

Q. Yeah. Just let's just take the lower --

A. Well --

Q. -- Horizontal bar of the gate. You saw where we have items No. 115
and 116 again, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. Yeah and both of those drops were definitely in your view, no
question about it, they were there on June 13, 1994, right?

A. That's correct.

Q. Zoom in on that.

A. You have a terrible photo here.

Q. Terrible photo, huh. Tell us where they are.

A. This is 115 in this area here. Because of the angle, the graininess
of the photo, because of the distance and because I believe the 116 is
recessed up and it's a lot smaller, it's pretty difficult to see. But
you can clearly see this blood drop.

Q. And 115 isn't there; is it?

A. It might be 116.

Q. Okay.

A. This is 115. 116 is not visible for the reasons stated.

Q. So it was there and the photograph, just kind of omitted it, right?

A. Photograph? Didn't omitt it. There were, as you can see, it's
smaller. This is an extremely grainy photo. It's recessed up farther
than 115.

Q. And that photo shows all the way to the mesh in the gate. And if
116 had been there, it would be on that photo, agree or disagree?

A. It is on that photo because of the reasons stated. You can't see it
because of the reasons stated. These photographs were not taken to
highlight that blood. That blood was not checked on this day.

Q. We are well aware of that.

A. Well, I don't know, sir. I'm trying to tell you here what happened
with this photograph and you clearly see this blood droplet. The other
is smaller and it's recessed -- and it's a grainy photo -- and there's
distance.

Q. I see. So you believe that 116 is there and it's just impossible to
see because you're an expert in grainy photos and recessing, right?

A. No, no.

MR. BAKER: I don't have anything further.

THE COURT: Okay. Ladies and gentlemen, 1:30. Don't talk about the
case. Don't form or express any opinion.

(At 12:00 P.M. a recess was taken until 1:30 of the same day.)

SANTA MONICA, CALIFORNIA FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 1, 1996 1:32 P.M.

DEPARTMENT NO. WEQ HON. HIROSHI FUJISAKI, JUDGE

(REGINA D. CHAVEZ, OFFICIAL REPORTER)

(Jurors resume their respective seats.)

(The following proceedings were held in open court, in the presence of
the jury.)

MR. BAKER: Your Honor I apologize.

Mr. Lange, I did find the photograph to the menu.

THE WITNESS: Okay. Thank you.

THE CLERK: And you are still under oath.

Would you state your name again for the record.

THE WITNESS: Tom Lange.

THE CLERK: Thank you. THOMAS LANGE the witness on the stand at the
time of the luncheon recess, having been previously duly sworn, was
examined and testified further as follows: REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR.
MEDVENE:

Q. You made reference to the pendant when you were questioned today
and the fact that it was kept in your desk drawer for a period of time
because you said it wasn't practical to book it. And you held it for a
purpose.

What purpose did you hold it for?

A. From time to time, there are items from a crime scene in a case
that an investigator may want to hold onto for personal identification
purposes. It's a lot more practical to do that than to book an item
and not be able to have access to it when you want it.

So that's why I held onto that particular pendant.

Q. Did you use it from time to time in the course of your
investigation?

A. Yes.

Q. There was reference to the Reebok shoes. Approximately what time
did you receive those shoes?

A. I took them into custody sometime after 6:00 p.m., I believe, on
the 13th.

Q. Did you then have the conversation with Captain Gartland that you
made reference to earlier?

A. Yes.

MR. BAKER: I'm going to object. That's leading and suggestive.

THE COURT: Sustained.

(BY MR. MEDVENE) What did you do with the shoes?

Excuse me. When did you book the shoes?

A. The following morning, at the lab, turned them over to Mr. Matheson
for analyzing. That would have been the 14th of June.

Q. Approximately what time?

A. 7:00 a.m.

Q. Now, you made reference to a key being taken out of a duffel bag.

Who was present when that key was taken out of the duffel bag; that
is, the Smokey the Bear key --

A. There were other keys taken out. I believe I testified to two
rings. It was myself and my partner, Detective Vannatter, Detective
Dennis Payne. I believe Captain Gartland was present, District
Attorney Marcia Clark, District Attorney Bill Hodgman, and I believe
Detective Pietrantoni, P-I-E-T-A-R-N-T-O-N-I, I believe.

Q. What did you do with the Smokey the Bear key?

A. I gave them to Detective Payne.

Q. What was the purpose of giving them to Detective Payne?

A. To have --

MR. BAKER: I object, Your Honor. It's irrelevant what the purpose was.
It's outside the scope, as well.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: To get a lock made that would fit.

MR. BAKER: I move to strike, Your Honor, in view of the previous
ruling of the Court.

THE COURT: This portion may come in.

THE WITNESS: To get a lock constructed from those keys.

(BY MR. MEDVENE) I will -- I'm going to place on the TV monitor what's
been marked Exhibit 2109.

(The instrument herein referred to as Copy of property report was
marked for identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 2109.)

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Can you tell me what -- could you first go to the
broad shot.

Can you tell me what that is?

A. That is a property report with this case DR number on it, and a
number of items booked.

Q. Can you then go to date and time property taken into police custody
--

Can you zoom in on that, please.

A. That's June 17, 1994 at 2030 hours, which is 8:30 p.m., at 360
North Rockingham.

Q. Would you now zoom in, please, to the first paragraph.

Does that make any reference to the Smokey the Bear key ring?

A. Yes.

Q. And what does it say?

A. Well, if you want it verbatim, you have to hold it still.

(Indicating to monitor.)

There's an item number 290, states, one key ring with two keys and one
small ring with likeness of Smokey the Bear.

The narrative to this appears --

THE COURT: Can you go back up to the narrative for a moment, please.

A. Property recovered pursuant to a 187 investigation, which is
murder. Item 286 recovered from the owner of the Mezzaluna, which is
the top time card, states by who, by Detective Payne.

Q. Could we get down to the key.

What number is the key item?

A. The keys, I believe there's three items of keys: 289, 290, and 291.

Q. Could we go up to the paragraph to see when they were recovered?

A. Items 289, 290, and 291, which are the keys in question, retrieved
at 360 North Rockingham, where the bag was picked up on --

MR. MEDVENE: Move it over a little bit.

No, the other way.

A. -- on June 17, 1994.

MR. MEDVENE: That's fine.

THE WITNESS: That's it.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Next area, some question about a menu. Would you
put up -- and whether or not a menu was photographed at the crime
scene.

MR. MEDVENE: Would you put up, please, Exhibit 875.

Would you zoom in, if you could.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Could you tell us what that picture depicts?

A. That's the right foot of victim Brown, and additionally, that's a
fast-food Oriental menu below the angle area.

Q. What date was that picture taken?

A. That was taken on the morning of June 13.

MR. MEDVENE: Would you put on the board, please, Exhibit 2110.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) And I ask you what that is.

A. It's a close-up shot of the same menu.

Q. Thank you.

Did you do any investigation to make a determination whether that menu
was generally distributed to the Bundy neighborhood?

A. I did.

Q. And what did you determine?

A. That it was a common item deposited in all of the mailboxes in the
neighborhood.

Q. Now, with reference to July 3 and the walk-through you've told us
about, in which there was some discussion of the rear gate, you used
the word "additional" in your report.

What did you mean by the word "additional?"

A. I meant additionally collected evidence, additionally collected
blood drops.

Q. Yesterday, you were asked some questions regarding shoe prints.

Did you see more than one pattern of bloody shoe prints on the Bundy
walkway?

A. No.

Q. Did you see more than one pattern of bloody shoe prints between the
two murder victims?

A. No.

Q. Yesterday, you made reference to a supplemental arrest report that
you prepared. I believe it was marked 1061.

Can you tell us when that report was written?

A. Supplemental report or a follow-up?

Q. Follow-up investigation.

A. Follow-up report. When it was written?

Q. Yes, sir.

A. It was written over a period of three or four days. The last
paragraph was written on June 17. The bulk of the information in this
was written about June 15.

Q. Did you know on June 13, at about 5:00 a.m. in the morning, that
Detective Phillips had stated that Mr. Simpson and Ms. Brown had been
embroiled in a previous domestic-violence situation or situations, one
of them resulting in the arrest of Mr. Simpson?

A. No.

MR. BAKER: Leading.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) What was the purpose of the follow-up
investigation report?

A. That particular follow-up report is a compilation of events and
incidents that occurred from the outset of this investigation, to the
point where we filed the case with the district attorney's office.

The district attorney's office requires this form before they file any
case, which is a chronological statement of the information. You have
to date it. As a consequence, this report was made prior to filing.

THE COURT: Mr. Medvene, would you take a look at that exhibit, make
sure the number you --

MR. MEDVENE: Yes, sir.

THE COURT: -- Gave is correct.

MR. MEDVENE: Yes, sir.

(Counsel confer.)

MR. MEDVENE: I will clear up the record if I have the wrong number,
Your Honor.

If I could proceed, then I'll clear it up, unless you want me to do it
now.

MR. PETROCELLI: Your Honor, it was originally offered by the defense,
but they did not give it an exhibit number at the time. So maybe we
can just give it the next in order.

THE CLERK: 2111.

MR. PETROCELLI: 2111?

THE CLERK: Correct.

MR. PETROCELLI: Okay.

(The instrument herein referred to as Copy of supplemental report of
6/17/94 was marked for identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No.
2111.)

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) When did you first receive the information that
Mr. Simpson and Ms. Brown had been involved in previous
domestic-violence situations, one of them resulting in Mr. Simpson's
arrest?

A. I believe it was later on in the day, perhaps late afternoon or the
evening of June 13.

Q. Yesterday, when counsel questioned you, there was some reference to
the word "rapport" in connection with your seeing Mr. Simpson.

What was your purpose in going to see Mr. Simpson?

A. Certainly that was part of it, to attempt to build a rapport, to
get to know him, because he certainly could have information that
could help us in this investigation. As a matter of fact, he may have
immediate information that could help us point in the direction that
morning. We certainly don't know until we ask him. She may have been
getting threats. There may have been a suspect that he was familiar
with he could have told us about. Being so close and having -- sharing
the children, and this type of a situation. So, in my mind, it was
very important to do that.

Q. With reference to fingerprints, any unidentified prints, as you sit
here, do you recall any that were found in the area where the murders
occurred?

A. Unidentified prints?

Q. Yeah.

A. No. I don't believe there were.

Q. If a murderer was wearing gloves when he committed the murders,
would fingerprints be left?

A. No.

Q. Now, you made reference to an object that was utilized to cover Ms.
Brown. Can you describe that object?

A. I believe you're referring to the blanket.

It was a hospital blanket, white in color. It was -- had tightly woven
fabric. It appeared cleaned -- freshly laundered. And basically,
that's it.

It was a hospital blanket.

Q. What time of the morning, approximately, if you recall, did you
make a request for something to cover Ms. Brown?

A. I think it was shortly after I returned, which would make it
sometime after 7:00 a.m.

Q. What were the lighting conditions?

A. Excellent. It was daylight.

Q. Was the media there?

A. They were beginning to arrive, to set up cameras across the street.

Q. What were the reasons that you wanted something to cover Ms. Brown?

A. At a crime scene, an investigator has to be concerned with
contamination with the crime scene, but he also has to be concerned
with the compromising of a crime scene.

With the amount of cameras, the multitude of media across the street,
sitting up on a hill, shooting directly down within 120 feet of the
body -- the body being evidence; the position that body is in is
evidence; any wounds on that body are evidence; any blood appearance
on that body is evidence; the clothing on that body is evidence; the
way that clothing is torn left to right or how that clothing appears
on the body is evidence.

Jewelry or lack thereof on the body is evidence. The number of wounds
are evidence. Everything having to do with that body is evidence.

To leave that body exposed, number one, is to leave it open to all of
the media of the world to zoom in on with cameras that can basically
highlight a human hair at 200 feet, and we would have our evidence
that I want to keep to myself broadcast all over the world.

This is what an investigator calls keys. Keys are things that I could
use to eliminate a potential suspect or a witness in this case,
especially in a high profile case.

As a consequence, I had to protect them. I had to make a decision to
protect them this way. That's why the blanket.

There's also a secondary consideration. Certainly, regarding that body
in public, if this woman's family were to turn on their television set
and see their daughter, it certainly wouldn't go over too well,
either. However, I have to say that is a secondary consideration, and
the main reason is really the previous reason that I stated.

MR. MEDVENE: I have nothing further, Your Honor.

Thank you very much. RECROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. BAKER:

Q. Let me see if I -- you testified a little earlier that basically,
you couldn't see the body because of the foliage and the poor
lighting; isn't that right?

A. No. I believe you have -- you're taking that out of contest.

Q. Just, if you can, answer the question. Just answer my question,
would you, please.

If you didn't testify to that, you have no recollection, just say I
didn't; it's that simple.

MR. MEDVENE: The question is ambiguous as to time or vague as to time.

THE COURT: Vague as to time, sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You say that you were concerned because all of this
evidence was on the body of Nicole Brown Simpson, and that was the
reason for covering it, right?

A. Potential evidence. Obviously, we don't know what we have at the
time, but we need to protect that evidence from compromise, that's
correct.

Q. Was all of that potential evidence on the body at 5:00 a.m. when
you decided to leave the crime scene, 875 South Bundy, for two hours?
Was it all there then?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Assumes facts not in evidence, that he
intended to leave for two hours. That misstates the record, Your
Honor.

THE COURT: Most of the questions. Okay. Overruled.

THE WITNESS: We intended to leave for about 10 or 15 minutes. There
were no media there, so I was not concerned at this time. I was
concerned when I returned; it was light, and the media started to show
up.

Q. Now, that blanket then becomes evidence because you have transfer
of blood. You have transfer of trace evidence onto the blanket, and
that blanket then becomes evidence, right?

A. I suppose that's a possibility. It could, yes.

Q. Put it on.

You left the blanket at the crime scene for souvenir seekers, didn't
you?

A. No. I wasn't even there at the time the crime scene was closed
down, Mr. Baker.

Q. You made no effort whatsoever, sir, to have the blanket preserved.
And that's it right there in that photograph, isn't it?

A. Unfortunately, I was not afforded the walk-through. I was not there
when this occurred. I wish I had.

I take full responsibility for the criminalist not picking up that
blanket. I wish he had.

My mind didn't have anything to do with the evidence in this case, no.

MR. BAKER: Could I have that read back, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Well, I think he's answered it.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) If you wanted to keep the photographs from being
taken, all you had to do was park an evidence van -- get the
criminalist out there, park an evidence van in front of the parkway;
isn't that true?

A. No. It was extremely simplistic. That certainly wouldn't have done
for the helicopters. Bundy is a major thoroughfare for commuter
traffic, people going to work.

High-tech cameras could have set up in a 360 in the air. It's just --

Q. So it just wouldn't have worked?

A. I don't believe it would have, no.

Q. Fair enough.

Now, let's talk about the keys again.

I think we discussed that the plastic heart which you kept in your
desk for identification purposes, you kept it there for ten weeks,
right?

A. I don't recall how long it was. Could -- would have been something
like that, yeah.

Q. Let me show you the property report that you just read from, and
ask you to tell the jury the day that the evidence was booked for
those two sets of keys and that heart that you kept in your desk for
ten weeks.

A. There were several items booked that day.

Q. I'm just asking you to tell --

A. Would you like me to answer your question?

Q. Yeah. Just give me a date, Mr. Lange? Give me a date.

A. I was about to do that, and you cut me off.

Q. Thank you.

A. All right.

August 25, 1994.

Q. So these -- these keys that you say you removed from the duffel bag
on June 17, 1994, you booked ten weeks later; so, on August 25, 1994,
right?

A. No. And I never said that I took them out June 17.

Q. Is it your testimony now, that you're saying that the keys, the two
keys, sets of keys, one with Smokey the Bear and the other with a
U.S.C. key ring, were not taken out on the 17th, sir?

A. Now, before and whenever you asked me, that's correct. They were
taken out sometime in August.

Q. Let me show you another document and ask you if this is a document
indicating what was removed from the O.J. Simpson travel bag from A.C.
Cowlings' Bronco on June 17, 1994.

A. These are other items that were in that bag; that's correct.

Q. So those are other items?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

A. That I already testified to.

Q. Now, these indicate -- well, let me ask you this question, Mr.
Lange:

I take it that the documentation of crime-scene evidence is more
important, and without proper documentation, the integrity of the
evidence is at risk, true?

A. It's a possibility of that occurring, certainly.

Q. And in the property report, that shows that from the duffel bag,
there is no indication that there was any -- or Mr. Simpson's travel
bag taken from A.C. Cowlings' Bronco, there's no indication of keys,
correct?

You'll agree with that?

A. In this particular report, no, there isn't. There shouldn't be.

Q. And in the report -- that is, the other report, it doesn't mention
anything about any travel bag, does it?

A. No. It wouldn't necessarily mention a travel bag. Different items
are booked at different times for different purposes. There's nothing
says we have to book everything in at once for one purpose.

Q. When you inventory property of a person, are you telling us that
you take part of the stuff out of a travel bag and then you document
part of it, and then you book part of it, and then you take more of it
out at a subsequent time, and then you book it at another time?

A. That's also a bit of a convoluted explanation in this particular
case. I'll tell you specifically and exactly what happened.

Q. No; just answer my question for a change.

A. No; it doesn't get that convoluted, no.

THE COURT: I don't think you've indicated what the second document was
-- exhibit was, Mr. Baker.

MR. BAKER: Thank you. Property report.

MR. P. BAKER: 1412.

MR. BAKER: 1412.

(The instrument herein referred to as Copy of a property report dated
July 25, 1994 was marked for identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No.
1412.)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) And what's the date of the report that indicates
evidence was removed from O.J. Simpson's travel bag? What is the date
of that report?

A. The evidence that was recovered this particular --

Q. The day of the report, sir, upper left-hand corner.

A. I don't know if i have the right one or you've either misstated or
I have the wrong report. Evidence recovered from O.J. Simpson's
vehicle. This is --

Q. The document indicates --

A. This document, okay.

Q. It indicates that evidence was recovered from O.J. Simpson's travel
bag, which was removed from Al Cowlings' vehicle on 6/17. And the date
of the report is what, sir?

A. The date of the report is --

Q. July 25?

A. -- July.

Q. Right?

A. July 25, yes.

THE COURT: That's 1412?

MR. BAKER: Yes, sir.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) So you had items removed from the -- strike that.

All those people that you said were there when all this stuff was
removed from Mr. Simpson's travel bag, the D.A.s, Hodgman and Clark,
and other officers, that was all on the 17th, right?

A. No, no.

Q. It wasn't on the 17th when you removed all of the items from --

A. As to the meeting, no. The meeting occurred sometime after the
17th. This wasn't on the 17th.

Q. Oh, I thought -- I misunderstood you.

A. Maybe I misled you. The meeting occurred sometime after the 17th.
That's when everyone was there and we went through the bag. In the
meantime, the bag had been locked away and secured.

Q. So there was nothing removed from the bag until the meeting, to the
best of your knowledge, right?

A. I don't believe there was. I'm pretty certain that the bag was
looked into. People looked into it for one reason or another.

But the District Attorney wanted to get a firsthand look at everything
that was in the bag, and that's why we had the meeting. That's when I
discovered that those keys had similarities, and we had a key
situation that arose from that.

Q. Now, this indicates -- that is 1412 -- that this property was
recovered and reported on July 25, 1994, right?

A. Yeah. That's the date and time of this report, correct.

Q. That's not when the items were recovered, though?

A. That's the date and time of that report.

Q. Okay. And the date and time that the custody -- the property was
taken into custody was June 17, 1994, at 2200 hours?

A. Yes. That's the bag with everything in it.

Q. And then the date and time of this property, when it was recovered
-- and it certainly doesn't say where you have --

MR. BAKER: What's the number of the other property report, Phil, this
one?

MR. MEDVENE: 2109.

MR. P. BAKER: 2109.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, 2109 doesn't mention anything about any keys in
a duffel bag, does it, or a travel bag, or a bag, or anything else?

A. It mentions the keys, yes.

Q. It doesn't mention -- maybe my question is unclear. We'll try it
again.

It doesn't mention anything about a duffel bag, a travel bag, or
anything else, does it?

A. No, it wouldn't. Various different pieces of -- items -- some of it
didn't come out of the duffel bag.

Q. So the property report that's booked on 8/25/96, that includes the
pendant that you say you left in your desk for ten weeks, without
making a report on it at all; and then you have the keys that have not
had a report on them at all until 8/25/94. Is that correct, sir?

A. You said '96 earlier.

Q. I apologize.

A. Yes, as stated.

Q. All right. So we've got ten weeks before there is any documentation
by the LAPD on any of the keys or the pendant; would you agree?

A. No. I -- no.

Q. Where is the documentation of any of those items before August 25,
1994?

A. Written down documentation? I don't know what -- that I'd find --

Q. That's what I mean.

A. The item was taken into custody, the travel bag with everything in
it, and it was secured until we can get back to it. These reports
reflect when that happened.

Q. So there is no documentation until you or others documented it on
8/25, right?

A. The bag is, I believe, documented from June 6 to 17 -- I believe it
is -- as to all of the specific items inside.

Once again, same answer: No, not until we get back to it.

Q. Let's get to the murder follow-up report, 2011.

The murder follow-up report was done in toto by you, correct?

A. No.

Q. You authored this; that's what you suggested to us.

A. I wrote it, but it's a compilation of information received from
people like Vannatter, Phillips, Fuhrman, criminal record checks, DMV
record checks, coroner's information, that type of thing. The lab. We
have information from the lab on this, various people from the lab. So
there might be as many as 10 or 15 people that had something to do
with that report.

Q. And you are kind of the melting pot. In other words, the
information comes to you; you get the information and you assimilate
the information; and then you put it in your murder follow-up report.

Exhibit 2011 is in a chronological sequence, correct?

A. That's basically --

MR. PETROCELLI: Your Honor, it's 2111, not 2011.

MR. BAKER: Okay. Sorry.

(The instrument herein referred to as a supplemental report dated
6/17/94 was marked for identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No.
2011.)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) And you put it in a chronological sequence, correct?

A. Generally, yes.

Q. And you put it -- was your writing that was dated June 13, 1994.

At approximately 0010 hours, victim 1, Nicole Brown Simpson, age 35,
and victim 2, Ron Goldman, age 25, were found stabbed to death in the
front walkway of victim 1 at 875 South Bundy Drive in West Los
Angeles.

That was your first paragraph, right?

A. Yes.

Q. Then you said: Upon arrival at the crime scene, detectives were met
by -- and then the detectives you're referring to are yourself and Mr.
Vannatter, correct?

A. Could I see a copy of that?

Q. Sure. Sure. Page 2, top of the paragraph where you say detectives
were met?

A. Top paragraph?

Q. Paragraph 2, top of the page.

A. Oh, I see.

Crime scene taken by Detective 3, Ron Phillips, West Los Angeles
homicide coordinator.

Q. When you say, "Upon arrival at the crime scene, detectives were
met," you meant the detectives who were listed on the first page of
the report, that being Lange and Vannatter?

A. Yeah.

Q. So you two were met by Ron Phillips, West L.A. Division Homicide
Coordinator, true?

A. Yes.

Q. Phillips stated that victim Brown was the ex-wife of O.J. Simpson.

He told you that when you met him?

A. I think that was something I learned later. At the time, I didn't
know.

Q. You can answer it yes or no?

A. Well, then, I'd have to say no.

Q. Okay. Fine.

And you then state that, "Additionally, Phillips stated Mr. Simpson
and victim 1 had been embroiled in previous domestic-violence
situations, with one of these resulting in the arrest of Mr. Simpson.

Then you state, "Mr. Simpson resided at 306 North Rockingham Place in
Brentwood, approximately two miles from the crime scene. Detectives
followed up to the Simpson residence for the purposes of death
notification and to check on Mr. Simpson's welfare."

That's what you said, right?

A. I believe that's what it says. I don't have a copy in front of me.

Q. And you were putting all that in chronological sequence, were you
not?

A. Generally, yes.

Q. And so you were going up to check on `Mr. Simpson's welfare?

A. That's a very general term, which would include the welfare of his
children --

Q. You never met --

A. -- his emotional --

Sir, I possibly didn't mention a lot of things, but I did mention most
things that were relevant to the writing of that report to give to the
District Attorney to file this case.

Q. Now, you talked about shoes. And Mr. Medvene just questioned you a
little bit, sir, about some shoes.

Now, those shoes were shoes that you had obtained from Mr. Simpson,
correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And you obtained those shoes from Mr. Simpson upstairs in his
house, in his closet, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And so you had been upstairs on the 13th in Mr. Simpson's house, in
his closet, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And you hadn't found any Bruno Magli or any bloody shoes, had you,
and you looked?

A. No.

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Outside the scope, Your Honor.

THE WITNESS: We had no idea these were Bruno Magli shoes until two
months later, at least.

Q. MR. BAKER: You looked for bloody shoes and didn't find them, true?

THE COURT: I'm going to sustain the objection as going beyond the
scope of the redirect examination.

MR. BAKER: Let me get to it as quick as I can.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You took the Reebok tennis shoes because Mr. Simpson
told you he had been wearing those the night previously, right?

A. There were other reasons; there were others.

Q. And you took those shoes and you took them to your police unit, and
you took them home to Simi Valley, right?

A. Yes.

Q. And then you took them back the next morning and you booked them as
evidence, correct?

A. No.

Q. You had them --you hadn't given -- you had a DR number for the
case, and they were listed in the property report as item 17?

A. No. I gave them to Mr. Matheson at the lab for analysis. He was
then going to give it to Mr. Fung, who did the booking of items in
this case. Mr. Fung would have booked them. But I wanted some work
done on those shoes first.

That's why I gave them to Mr. Matheson the following morning at the
first possible opportunity to give them to him, which was 7:00 a.m.
Tuesday.

Q. And those Reebok shoes were booked as evidence before the blood
vial was taken from Mr. Simpson the previous afternoon. At 2:30, it
was booked.

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Outside the scope.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: I don't believe so. They weren't booked.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) The reference blood from Mr. Simpson's arm that was
taken at 2:30 on the 13th, was item 18, and was not booked until after
the shoes that you took from Mr. Simpson's house on the afternoon of
the 13th; isn't that true, sir?

A. I have no idea as to when it was booked.

MR. BAKER: I don't have anything further.

MR. MEDVENE: Just a question or two.

FURTHER REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. MEDVENE:

Q. Was the inventory report that counsel asked you about, I believe
it's 1412, was that prepared after the keys were taken from the duffel
bag and given to Detective Lange -- or Detective Payne?

A. I don't have -- I don't recall specifically what that date was. I
do recall, though, that they were given to Detective Payne at the time
the inventory was done with the district attorney. And if I had my
chronological record, perhaps I could look into that.

I don't know. I don't recall what that date was.

Q. And 2109 that you have, that property report, that shows the keys
retrieved at 6/17/1994?

A. Taken into custody on June 17, yes, 1994.

Q. At what time?

A. 2030 hours, which is 8:30 p.m.

Q. Is that when Mr. Simpson was arrested and in Mr. Cowlings' car?

A. Yes.

MR. MEDVENE: I have nothing further.

MR. BAKER: No questions.

MR. PETROCELLI: Your Honor, I have a series of exhibits that were
referred to. If there are no objections from the defense, there's
quite a number of them. I can identify them into the record now, move
them into the evidence right now.

THE COURT: Go ahead.

MR. PETROCELLI: I'll just refer to the numbers. They're in the joint
trial statement.

Exhibits 20, 57, 36, 46, 47, 719, 32, 91, 38, 43, 45, 47, 1781, 54,

676, 2010, -- excuse me -- 2110 and 2111. 2111.

understand that you may, on occasion, have some immediate personal
needs that need to be attended to. If it's something that's immediate,
don't hesitate to raise your hand and interrupt me.

If it's something that's not immediate, let the bailiff know, and the
bailiff will convey your needs to me.

All right. We'll see you in about ten minutes or so.

(Recess taken.)

(Jurors resume their respective seats.)

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, I would object to 2111 going into evidence. We
can argue it at another time.

THE COURT: Okay.

MR. BAKER: Thank you, sir.

THE COURT: Call your next witness.

MR. KELLY: Mr. Vannatter, please. PHILIP VANNATTER, called as a
witness on behalf of Plaintiff Brown, was duly sworn and testified as
follows:

THE CLERK: You do solemnly swear that the testimony you may give in
the cause now pending before this court shall be the truth, the whole
truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

THE WITNESS: I do.

THE CLERK: And if you'd please state and spell your name for the
record.

THE WITNESS: Philip Vannatter, P-H-I-L-I-P, V-A-N-N-A-T-T-E-R. DIRECT

A. The Los Angeles police department.

Q. And as of June 13, 1994, how long have you been employed by the Los

A. Yes, I did.

Q. And first of all, what is Parker Center?

A. Parker Center is the main police building to the Los Angeles police
department.

Q. Okay. And you recall where, specifically, you were within Parker

Q. That was Thano Peratis, as you mentioned before?

A. Yes.

Q. Was it your request he withdrew the blood from Simpson?

A. Yes.

A. He injected the needle through the purple top cap of the vial and
injected the blood into the vial.

Q. There was no top to remove from the vial to place the blood in
there; is that correct?

A. That's correct. There was no top removed.

Q. The needle was placed through the top?

A. That is correct.

with the vial after the blood had been placed in there?

MR. BAKER: Objection. Foundation.

THE COURT: Witness may testify to what he observed.

THE WITNESS: He placed it into a small manila envelope and gave it to
me.

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) Okay.

And do you know whether there were any markings on the vial before it
was given to you?

A. Yes.

Q. And what markings were those?

A. Mr. Simpson's name was placed on it and my name was placed on it.

Q. Okay. And what, if anything, did you do with the vial when you
received it from Nurse Peratis at that time?

A. I hand carried it up to the third floor, robbery/homicide division.

Q. Okay.

And what, if anything, did you do once you arrived on the third floor
at robbery/homicide division?

A. I obtained an analyzed evidence envelope, a specific envelope for
blood; for whole blood, filled out the front paperwork on the front of
it as best I could; because I didn't have all the information, and
placed the vial within the envelope.

Q. I'm sorry. What color, again, was that envelope?

A. A gray envelope.

Q. And would you be able to describe the proximate size of that
envelope for me?

A. Yeah. It's approximately 8 by 10.

Q. And after you placed -- after you completed that paperwork on the
envelope, do you -- did you do anything with the vial at that time?

A. No. I laid it down on my desk.

Q. Did you place the vial in the envelope?

A. Oh, yeah. After I placed the vial in the -- In the envelope, I laid
it on my desk.

Q. Okay. Did there come a time that you departed Parker Center that
day subsequent to placing that vial in that envelope?

A. Yes.

Q. And approximately what time did you depart from Parker Center?

A. Approximately 4:00 p.m.

Q. Okay. And in what manner did you depart from Parker Center? How did
you leave there?

A. I drove the city issued vehicle that was issued to me.

Q. Did anybody leave with you in that car at that time?

A. No. I was by myself in the car.

Q. Okay. And did you take that evidence envelope with the vial with
you at that time also?

A. I did.

Q. Okay. And could you tell me where, if anywhere, you were heading at
approximately 4 o'clock when you left Parker Center?

A. Yes, to 360 north Rockingham in Brentwood.

Q. And can you tell me the route you took in going from Parker Center
to get to Rockingham at that time?

A. I took the Santa Monica freeway, west to the San Diego freeway, as
I recall; and I believe I got off at Sunset Boulevard.

Q. Would you be able to describe the traffic conditions to me that
existed at that time you made the drive from the Parker Center to
Rockingham?

A. They were extremely heavy.

Q. Do you recall at approximately what time you arrived at Rockingham?

A. Shortly after 5:00 P.M.

Q. And did you get out of your car at that time?

A. Yes.

Q. Did you take that evidence envelope with the vial in it at that
time also?

A. Yes.

Q. And what, if anything, did you do with that evidence envelope with
the vial in it when you got to Rockingham at approximately 5:00, 5:15?

A. I walked directly to the front foyer area of the residence and
handed it to Dennis Fung, the criminalist.

Q. At any time prior to turning over that vial in the evidence in to
Dennis Fung, the criminalist, did you ever put that vial in your
pocket?

A. Never.

Q. Okay. Did you ever even take that vial out of the evidence envelope
after you had filled the sample and in --

MR. BAKER: Leading and suggestive.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: No.

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) Mr. Vannatter, I now want to draw your attention to
June 15, 1994, two days later. Okay?

Do you recall where you were at approximately 8:30 A.M. on that
morning?

A. I do.

Q. And where were you at that time?

A. The Los Angeles county coroner's office.

Q. And at that time and at that place, did you obtain anything from
the coroner's office?

A. I did about 15 minutes after 8:30; about 8:45. Yes, I did.

Q. And what did you obtain at that time?

A. The Nicole Brown Simpson's blood sample and Ronald Goldman's blood
sample.

Q. And when you say you obtained their samples, what were these blood
samples in?

A. They were in vials that had been prepared by the autopsy surgeon.

Q. And were the vials contained within anything else?

A. They were removed from refrigeration, placed in manila envelopes,
sealed and given to me, yes.

Q. Okay. And those envelopes were sealed when you received them?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay. And were those envelopes labeled on the outside when you
received them?

A. They were just plain envelopes. The actual vial itself was labeled.

Q. Okay. Now when you were at the coroner's office receiving these two
vials in the separate sealed envelopes, was there any procedure you
had to follow before receiving them?

A. Yes. I had to sign an evidence control log, Los Angeles county
coroner's control log.

Q. Did you do that on that day?

A. I did.

Q. Let me see if I can see 387, please.

And Mr. Vannatter, I'd like to direct your attention to what's on the
screen there.

A. I'm having a hard time seeing.

Q. Maybe you might want to stand up and step around and look at -- can
you make that any smaller? Smaller, so you get the whole thing.

(The instrument herein described as coroner's documents consisting of
autopsy evidence collection log; evidence log for Ron Goldman,
evidence log for Nicole Brown Simpson, drop-box log was marked for
identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 387.)

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) First of all, are you able to recognize that
document?

A. Yes, I am.

Q. Okay. Is that the evidence log you referred to that you would have
had to sign out of when you received the evidence that day?

A. That's correct. That would appear that that's a copy of it. I
recognize my signature on the log, yes.

Q. So could you focus it a little bit, please?

If you could just step up and point out where you see your signature
there.

A. Yes, sir. My signature is right above the printed information that
was done by the coroner's office, P. L. Vannatter. That's my
signature.

Q. That's your badge number also?

A. Yes. That information was recorded by the coroner's office.

Q. Why don't you just read me the information that was recorded on
that format with your signature?

A. Phil Vannatter, serial No. 14877, LAPD Robbery/homicide division,
by G. Siglar. I believe the date 654 -- the time, sorry, 845 hours.

Q. Does G. Siglar refer to a name?

A. That's a person that works in the laboratory at the coroner's
office.

Q. Is that the person who you obtained the vials from?

A. Yes.

Q. What does the time, 8:45 A.M. represent?

A. That would have been the time they released to me.

Q. Okay.

You can have a seat again, please.

Now, Mr. Vannatter, after receiving those two vials of blood, one of
Nicole Brown Simpson, one of Ron Goldman; what, if anything, did you
do with them at that time?

A. I proceeded directly to Scientific Investigation Division, located
at Piper Tech.

Q. And how far is Piper Tech from the coroner's office where you
picked up the blood?

A. Approximately a five- to ten-minute drive.

Q. Okay.

And what, if anything, did you do when you arrived there with those
two vials?

A. I signed in the laboratory, went directly to the supervisor
serologist's office and delivered the two vials.

Q. Were the envelopes still sealed when you delivered them as they had
when you received them at the coroner's office?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And one other thing, if we could, flip on 721, please, Steve.

(Mr. Foster complies, displays exhibit 721.)

(The instrument herein described as SID, sign-in sheets, 6/15/94, was
marked for identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 721.)

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) I'd ask you if -- you indicated you signed in when
you arrived at the coroner's office --

A. No.

Q. -- Is that correct? I mean at the S.I.D., scientific investigation?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. That's correct. And you -- do you recognize that document that's
reflected on the screen at this time? You can step --

A. May I get up and look?

Q. Sure.

(Witness approaches screen.)

A. Yes. This is, it would appear, a xerox copy of the log that was
maintained by scientific investigation division to allow you entry
into the area.

Q. Okay. And if you could just stay there a moment, Steve. Can you
focus it a little bit?

And can you tell me, Mr. Vannatter, what, from -- what information is
reflected on the form there moving from left to right?

A. Yes. I recognize my printing. My first initial, last name. RHD
stands for Robbery/homicide division. Extension 2531 stands for the
phone extension in my office, and my serial No. 14877, and the time
that I signed in, is 0850 in the morning.

Q. That was approximately five minutes after you left the coroner's
office?

A. That's correct, sir. Yes.

MR. KELLY: Okay. I have no further questions. CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR.
BAKER:

Q. Good afternoon.

A. Good afternoon, sir.

Q. Now, how many meetings did you have with the Plaintiffs' attorneys
before you came here to testify as an independent witness?

A. How many meetings total, sir.

Q. Yeah. Since Mr. Simpson was acquitted on October 3, 1994, how many
meetings have you had with somebody from Mitchell, Silverberg and
Knupp office or Mr. Kelly's office or Mr. Brewer's office? How many
meetings?

A. I had -- let me think. I had one meeting with Mr. Medvene before I
retired, the week before I retired. I had one meeting with Mr. Kelly,
approximately a month ago. And I met with Mr. Kelly last night for a
brief time and this morning coming to court.

Q. And you consider the Goldmans your friends, do you not?

A. I consider -- I would hope that they're my friends, yes.

Q. And you've socialized with them out in the hall. You consider them
to be -- you consider yourself to be friendly to them, do you not?

A. Yes.

Q. And you have spent -- well, strike that.

Did you spend over 10, 12 hours getting ready to testify in on this
case?

A. No.

Q. And did Mr. Kelly, in your meetings last night, tell you what they
wanted to do was to limit it just to the blood vials? That you had
control of this case?

MR. KELLY: Objection, Your Honor. Relevance.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. BAKER: On what ground?

MR. KELLY: Relevance. My discussions with him, what I said to Mr.
Vannatter. Hearsay, Judge.

THE COURT: That I'll sustain.

MR. BAKER: Did you understand from your meetings with Mr. Kelly, that
you were to limit your testimony to just the blood vials. That you had
control of all of the victims and Mr. Simpson --

MR. KELLY: Same objection, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Sustained. That's all that was examined and that goes
beyond it.

MR. BAKER: I will get into that in a minute, I'm sure.

MR. KELLY: Objection. I'd ask Mr. Baker's gratuitous comments be
stricken from the record.

THE COURT: Let's get on with it, please.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) At 2:30 in the afternoon -- well, strike that.

You were the co-lead detective in this case; is that right?

A. Yes, sir, I was.

Q. You were the co-lead detective from 4:25 in the morning on June 13,
1994, until the case was closed from RHD by the arrest of Mr. Simpson
6/17/1994, true?

A. Yes. Yes, that's true.

Q. And at 2:30 in the afternoon on June 13, 1994, you were at the jail
dispensary, after the you had been interrogating Mr. Simpson for at
least 30 minutes -- objection. Beyond the scope, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Sustained. I'm not going to get into anything beyond what
this witness was examined on direct.

MR. BAKER: I would ask the Court to look at cases that I gave to the
Court yesterday.

THE COURT: This witness is a witness called for a limited purpose by
plaintiff. If you want to examine him, you can call him on your
portion of the case as it is your own witness.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) At 2:30, the only reason that you could be at the
jail dispensary taking Mr. Simpson's blood is because he had offered
to allow you to take his blood in the half hour previous; isn't that
true?

MR. KELLY: Objection. Same objection. Goes beyond the scope as to what
was -- what was prior to his direct testimony. Your Honor, it's also
hearsay too.

THE COURT: It's a party. (Referring to counsel table.).

Overruled.

THE WITNESS: Yes. He volunteered to give a sampling, yes.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) He had, you had told Mr. Simpson that you had some
problems because you had blood at his house. And he said give me a
blood test, didn't he?

MR. KELLY: Objection, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Well, you certainly couldn't have taken Mr.
Simpson's blood without his permission, could you.

MR. KELLY: Objection. Argumentative, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Irrelevant. He's --

MR. KELLY: Irrelevant also.

(Laughter)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) So Mr. Simpson gave you permission to take his blood
on June 13, after you had been with him for 30 minutes, correct?

MR. KELLY: Objection to the second half of that question, Your Honor.
Compound in the second half. It is beyond the scope.

THE COURT: Overruled. Let's get on with it.

THE WITNESS: Yes.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) And when you went down to take Mr. Simpson's blood,
did he have any attorneys with him?

A. No.

Q. And so it was just you, Mr. Lange, and Nurse Peratis, correct?

A. And Mr. Simpson, yes.

Q. Well, if you were going to take his blood, he ought to be there,
don't you think?

So at that time you had a photographer come in, did you not, to the
area where the nurse was taking Mr. Simpson's blood?

MR. KELLY: Objection. Beyond the scope, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Photographer came in. Overruled.

THE WITNESS: No. I didn't have a photographer come in there.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Well, a photographer came in and took a picture of
Mr. Simpson's hand after the blood was drawn from him; isn't that
true?

MR. KELLY: Objection. Beyond the scope, Your Honor.

THE COURT: That's sustained.if he took the picture of him drawing
blood.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) During the time that Mr. Peratis was drawing blood
and you were in this jail dispensary, Mr. Peratis also dressed Mr.
Simpson's finger, didn't he?

MR. KELLY: Objection. Beyond the scope, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: He cleaned his finger, yes and put a Band-Aid on it.

Q. And you looked at Mr. Simpson's fingers at that time and his hands
at that time, didn't you?

A. I looked at his hand, yes.

Q. And he had one cut that was on the knuckle of -- or the middle
joint of his large finger, long finger on his left hand; isn't that,
true?

MR. KELLY: Objection. Beyond the scope.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. BAKER: It's at the time he's there looking at it.

THE COURT: I'm just interested in taking of the blood. That's all that
was examined of this witness. You want to use him for some other
witness, call him as your witness at your time.

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, I respectfully disagree with the Court's
ruling.

THE COURT: I know you do. You've done that several times. And I'm just
doing my job.

MR. BAKER: I'm trying to do mine.

THE COURT: I know.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, where do you live, sir?

MR. KELLY: Objection. Irrelevant.

THE COURT: Did you say this has some relevance to the taking of the
blood?

MR. BAKER: It has some relevance to him coming back so I can get him
here pursuant to your order.

MR. KELLY: Objection. If Mr. Baker has any application, I ask that it
be made at side bar.

THE COURT: Mr. Baker, if you want to make a request in that regard,
I'll make it.

MR. BAKER: Okay. Let's make it.

THE COURT: I'll have him in court.

MR. BAKER: Thank you.

THE COURT: So at the conclusion of today, please remind me.

MR. KELLY: Your Honor, before you do, I would like to be heard on
that.

THE COURT: You may.

MR. KELLY: Thank you.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, so at 2:30, this blood is drawn and you say
it's taken out with a syringe by the nurse and he injects the blood
into a purple-top tube, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And that purple-top tube isn't sealed; is it?

A. Yes, it is.

Q. You can take the top off that tube with impunity, can you not, sir?

A. No, sir. I couldn't.

Q. You couldn't.

A. No.

Q. Well. Was the -- Strike that.

The top on that tube can just be removed. It can be taken off with
your hands, can it not?

A. No, sir. I believe it's a vacuum tube.

Q. Cannot be taken off with your hands?

A. Well, I'm sure it could be if you wanted to pull it off. I believe
it's a vacuum sealed tube.

Q. And you took that tube, purple top tube and you put it in an
envelope after you got to your desk. Is that what your telling us,
sir?

A. Yes, sir, that's correct.

Q. And the gray envelope that you say it was put in was not given to
you by Nurse Peratis?

A. No, sir, it was not.

Q. And it does not have his signature on that envelope, right?

A. Well, it could. I don't know. I recall putting in an analyzed
evidence envelope. He may have given me one. I don't recall that.

Q. I thought you just testified -- correct me if I'm wrong. I thought
you just testified within the last 20 minutes that you took the tube,
you went up to your desk you got an 8 by 10 gray envelope from your
desk, an analyzed evidence envelope, and you put it in the analyzed
evidence envelope that you got from your desk; is that correct or
incorrect?

A. That's the way I recall it occurring, yes, sir.

Q. And you never went back with that envelope to Nurse Peratis at all,
did you, sir?

A. I don't recall ever doing that, no.

Q. And it would be highly unlikely that Nurse Peratis came up to your
desk between the time that you were there, between 2:30 and 4 o'clock
and put his signature on it; would you agree with that?

A. Yes, I would agree with that.

Q. If his signature were on it, you wouldn't know how it got there,
but you took the envelope from your desk and put the tube in it,
right?

A. Sir, I said that's the way I recall it occurring. He could have
given me one when I was down there.

Q. Mr. Vannatter, the issue of the vial of blood in this case has been
an issue over --

MR. KELLY: Objection.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. BAKER: Have you talked about this vial of blood on Larry King Live
on Geraldo Rivera, on Charles Groden; have you not?

MR. KELLY: Objection. Relevance.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: Yes, I have.

Q. And you have gone through every minute detail, telling everyone who
would listen about the minute details of how you had this blood; isn't
that true, sir?

A. I have tried to.

MR. KELLY: Objection. Argumentative, Your Honor, "everyone who would
listen."

THE COURT: Overruled. It's a manner of speech, I believe.

THE WITNESS: I have tried to tell the truth as I recall the truth and
how I handled the vial of blood, sir, yes.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You have gone over in your mind a thousand times,
the vial of blood story, have you not, relative to when you put it in
an envelope; whether it was sealed, unsealed, who signed it, all of
that; true?

A. I am trying to recall it as best as I can recall it. You're talking
about an incident that occurred over two years ago that was
insignificant to me at the time.

Q. And it has become exceedingly significant to you or you wouldn't be
on national television talking about it. You agree to that?

A. That doesn't make my memory any better, Mr. Baker.

Q. So your memory isn't any better now 40 minutes or 20 minutes from
the time you testified earlier that you got the envelope up from your
desk, true?

A. That's how I recall it happening, yes.

Q. All right. Now, when you got this envelope, from your desk and you
put the vial into it, and would you tell the ladies and gentlemen of
the jury how far this Piper Tech is where you could book evidence from
your desk --

MR. KELLY: Objection. Irrelevant, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled?

THE WITNESS: It's approximately a mile from Parker Center.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Can you -- would you tell the ladies and gentlemen
of the jury how far Mr. Simpson's house is from where you got the
envelope and put the vial into the envelope in your desk?

A. Approximately 15 miles.

Q. And you could have -- Strike that.

In terms of -- from the time you got this vial at 2:30 until 4
o'clock, the vial, did you call Rockingham to see if Mr. Fung was
there?

A. I believe I spoke with Ron Phillips.

Q. Did you call Rockingham to see if Mr. Fung was there; was the
question, sir.

THE COURT: Did you misstate it, or did I hear you wrong.

MR. BAKER: I could be wrong again, but I --

THE COURT: I thought I heard something strange.

MR. BAKER: Okay.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) As I understand it, you left Parker Center at 4
o'clock on the afternoon of the 13th knowing that you were going to
hit the evening traffic to go to Rockingham, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And you went there, sir -- and you went there to give this blood
vial to Mr. Fung, right?

A. That's correct.

Q. And you didn't know if Mr. Fung was there, did you?

A. Well, I knew the search warrant hadn't been completed and I made an
assumption that he was there.

Q. You didn't call out to the Rockingham place to find if Mr. Fung was
there, did you?

A. I did not no.

Q. You didn't use any police communication system to find out if he
was there, did you?

A. I did not.

Q. Did you see the tape where Mr. Fung and Andrea Mazzola were leaving
Rockingham and then said let's take one last look and then you drove
up?

MR. KELLY: Objection. Irrelevant.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. Did you see that tape, that videotape?

A. I've seen a number of tapes. I'm sure that I did, yes.

Q. And if Mr. Fung and Ms. Mazzola hadn't decided to take one last
look, they would have been gone. Did you see that tape?

A. He was there when I got there, Mr. Baker.

Q. Did you see the tape, sir?

A. I saw Fung there when I was there. I don't know about him being
gone.

Q. So you don't even know whether you left at 4 o'clock to -- and that
was purportedly to deliver this vial of blood, was it not?

A. It was to go check on the completion of the search warrant and to
deliver the vial of blood. That's correct.

Q. Now, the vial of blood was the major reason you left Parker Center
and you could have gone to S.I.D. or Piper Tech and where S.I.D.
booked it, right?

A. No, I couldn't have booked it.

Q. Okay. Now, in terms of your search warrant, let's talk a little bit
about the search warrant.

MR. KELLY: Objection.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. BAKER: I like to be heard on that, Your'Honor.

THE COURT: No. I've already made my ruling.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, had you in the past, Mr. Vannatter, just tell
us how many times you had taken a reference vial of blood -- well,
strike that. Mr. Simpson's blood was a reference vial, wasn't it?

A. Yes.

Q. And a reference vial of blood is blood that can be used, in this
case of Mr. Simpson, who was then a suspect, to determine whether or
not his blood may be consistent with other blood found at the crime
scene, correct?

A. As well as to exonerate him, yes.

Q. And one of you would agree that one of the fundamentals of being a
good crime scene procedure is not to take a reference vial of blood to
a crime scene. You would agree with that?

MR. KELLY: Objection, Your Honor. Relevance, beyond the scope,
speculative, argumentative.

THE COURT: The argument is overruled -- I mean sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Well, it would be inappropriate to take a reference
vial of blood to a crime scene. Because if it spills, you have
destroyed A; crime scene, and B; you have destroyed any ability to
exonerate the suspect of the reference vial, true?

MR. KELLY: Argumentative. Speculative and it's a compound question.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Did the reference vial of blood that you took to
Rockingham in your police vehicle have EDTA in it?

MR. KELLY: Objection. Beyond the scope.

THE COURT: If you know, overruled.

MR. KELLY: Foundation, your Honor, I'm sorry.

THE COURT: Sustained on foundation.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You talked about a purple top tube. You remember
that?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. Purple top is a tube that contains EDTA; is it not?

A. Yes.

MR. KELLY: Objection as to form. I'd ask that the specific tube, if
we're referring to --

THE COURT: The witness answered yes.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) And so this particular reference vial of blood of
Mr. Simpson had EDTA in it, right?

A. I believe it did, yes.

Q. An now, you were concerned and you wanted to get it out of there
because you felt that this was crucial piece of evidence.

MR. KELLY: Objection.

Q. That is Mr. Simpson's reference vial of blood.

MR. KELLY: Objection. Argumentative and compound.

THE COURT: Overruled as to this witness state of mind in taking the
blood out there.

THE WITNESS: I believed it was a piece of evidence that could
ultimately exonerate or include him in the crime, yes.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You thought it was so important that you wanted to
get it to Rockingham and to Dennis Fung; and that's the reason that
you left the Parker Center at approximately 4 o'clock on the afternoon
of the 13th, right?

A. I wanted to get it to the criminalist to get it booked, yes.

Q. And you knew, of course, that -- well, strike that. How many times
had you ever taken a reference vial ever blood to a processing crime
scene such as 360 north Bundy?

MR. KELLY: Objection. Irrelevant.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. BAKER: That's irrelevant.

THE COURT: We're talking about this case.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) How many times have you ever picked up a blood vial
from the victims at the coroner's office.

MR. KELLY: Objection. Same objection.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: Probably a number of times.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You've actually gone to the coroner's office like
you did -- strike that. Did you pick the blood up on the 15th?

A. Yes, that's correct.

Q. And the autopsy was on the 14th; was it not?

A. That's correct.

Q. So you made a special trip to the coroner's office to get the
blood?

A. That was not the entire purpose of the trip.

Q. Can you answer the question?

A. I did. That was not the entire purpose of the trip.

Q. You picked up the blood, which normally the coroner transfers to
S.I.D. without it ever touching a detective's hands. You would agree
with that?

A. Not always, no, I wouldn't.

Q. Was there any blood dripping off the vial of the blood vial that
was given to you at approximately 2:30?

A. I was given the vial in a sealed envelope. I don't know if there
was blood dripping off it or not.

Q. Did you ever look in that envelope to see if blood was dripping off
that vial?

MR. KELLY: Objection. I ask that the report be clarified to the -- he
was referring to 2:30 on the 13th in terms of the side envelope.

MR. PETROCELLI: Switched files, Your Honor. We're in the middle of the
coroner's vials Your Honor and then he framed a question that went
back to the 13th.

THE COURT: Sustained. Rephrase the question.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) The 13 --

A. Okay.

Q. -- Did you look in the envelopes or -- strike that. Was that vial
-- was there any blood dripping off that vial?

A. No.

Q. Did you check that?

A. Yeah. I placed the vial into an envelope. There was no blood on the
vial.

Q. And then there would be no transfer of that blood to the envelope,
right?

A. I didn't see any transfer of any blood, no.

Q. Fair enough. Now, in terms of your handling of that blood, that
blood was in your custody from 2:30 to after 5:00 in the afternoon on
the 13th, right, nobody else?

A. That's correct.

Q. And you went upstairs from 2:30 and did you have a cup of coffee?
What did you do?

A. I had something to eat.

Q. You had a cup of coffee, did you?

A. I had something to eat. I had a cup of coffee, yes.

Q. And you chatted with some people with the blood vial on your desk.
Where was it?

A. It was in the envelope on top of my desk.

Q. And I take it -- and where were you? Were you eating at your desk
the whole time?

A. I was in Robbery/homicide division. I kept control of the envelope
and I sat down at my desk and I ate a sandwich, yes.

Q. Did you take the envelope with you every where you went from 2:30
to 4 o'clock when you left Parker Center?

A. No, I don't think I took it every place I went. I think it was on
my desk for a period of time.

Q. How long were you away from that envelope?

A. I don't know I couldn't answer that. That would -- that would be
all guess work. I have no idea.

Q. But -- well, if this was such an important piece of evidence and
you wanted to get out to Mr. Fung, booking evidence at Rockingham, at
a processing crime scene, why did you take an hour and a half before
you ever started?

A. Well, I hadn't eaten for 24 hours. I had gotten up at 3 o'clock in
the morning. I was tired. I needed to relax a little bit. I needed to
sit down. I'm a 55-year-old man. I can't run constantly so I sat down.
I ate a sandwich and then I went out to Rockingham.

Q. So that took you an hour and a half, right?

A. Well, that took a portion of that time, yes. I talked to my partner
a little bit.

Q. And you didn't do any detective work in that hour and a half. You
just took your lunch --

A. Well, detective work, that's --

Q. Can you let me finish my question.

You just talked to your partner and got yourself some nourishment,
right?

A. Well, you asked the question. You didn't do any detective work.
That's detective work sometimes is talking with your partner,
comparing your notes, figuring out where to go next, what to do.

Q. Now, presently, sir, do you have a book deal?

A. Do I have a signed book deal?

No, I don't.

Q. Well, I take it then, from the way you answered the question,
you're negotiating for a book deal?

A. Yes.

Q. And you have an agent?

A. Yes.

Q. And you plan to make some money off of writing a book and giving
your story about this case, right?

A. I hope I do, yes.

MR. BAKER: I don't have anything further at this time and I want to be
able to order him back to court.

THE COURT: Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, we're going excuse you
until Monday, 8:30.

And let me remind you, again, don't talk about the case with anyone
and form or express any opinion.

Don't allow anybody to talk to you about this case.

I have prepared an order for you with regard to your work. Consider
yourself fully engaged in the trial. Any days that we don't actually
physically have you in court for one reason or another, you are still
considered engaged in this trial, so you do not return to work on
those days. Everybody understand that?

JURORS: (Nod in the affirmative.)

THE COURT: Okay. It's very important, don't let anybody give you a
hard time about this case. don't let them ask questions about it;
don't let them insinuate anything about it.

Don't -- in other words, don't let them pressure you about anything
about this case.

Everybody understand that?

JURORS: Yes.

THE COURT: Anything like that happens, let me know.

JURORS: (Nod in the affirmative.)

THE COURT: We'll see you Monday. Have a nice weekend.

JURORS: Thank you.

(The following proceedings were held in open court outside the
presence of the jury:)

THE COURT: Okay. The jurors have left the courtroom, Mr. Baker.

MR. BAKER: I want this witness ordered back to this trial on -- and
we'll give him appropriate notice and put him on relatively early in
our case.

MR. KELLY: Your Honor, first of all, Mr. Vannatter is a resident of
Indiana.

THE COURT: I have him right here in my hands right now.

MR. KELLY: I know. We're done with him. Okay.

The only thing I would ask, that, at the defense expense, if they want
him back --

MR. BAKER: No. They're making this compartmentalized case instead of
having this lawsuit tried. If they want to do it that way, that's
their strategy for whatever they want to do. I don't have any problem
with that.

But I think this witness should come back. I don't think we ought to
have to pay it. He's here now. I'm ready to cross-examine him for
another day. I can do it on Monday, if this Court please, but to try
to add expense to us for strategical reasons is insanity.

MR. KELLY: Your Honor, there's no reason we should bear the expense of
Mr. Baker's decision. We're bearing the expense. We brought him here
now. We're putting him in our order of proof the way we want to. I
don't believe we should bear the expense of when Mr. Baker wants him.

MR. BAKER: I will open my case Monday morning for purposes of taking
this witness out of order. And I will -- and I think I've proven to
this Court already, he's a hostile witness. If not, I think I can do
that with him and take him on cross-examination. I'm ready, willing
and able to do that on Monday, sir.

MR. KELLY: Your Honor, we --

MR. BAKER: If they don't want to have the expense paid of that, then,
you know, I'm ready, and there will be no expense that way.

THE COURT: Well, in the first place, the plaintiff has the right to
put on a witness for whatever purpose the plaintiff wants to put the
witness on for, and for whatever breadth or narrowness of the
testimony that he wishes to offer.

The defense has a right to put on their evidence to whatever extent
that the defense wishes to put on.

With regards to expense, I think if the plaintiff has finished with
his portion of the evidence, however narrow that is, and
cross-examination is complete thereon, I think that's the extent of
the plaintiff's expense. Defense may assume the expense of the witness
thereafter if the defense wishes to.

I have heard a reference that this witness is out of state. If that is
true, then I think that the defense makes a strong argument for having
this witness put on out of order, and as defense witness.

You may consider him an adverse witness. Nevertheless, he's going to
be your witness and your expense.

MR. BAKER: Fine. I'll put him on Monday morning.

MR. KELLY: Your Honor --

THE COURT: He's an out-of-state witness. You will put him on now I've
got my mitts on him because he's here. I will order him to return
Monday, and so be it.

MR. KELLY: Well, now, I was going to ask, can he be released and we'll
bring him back under your court order?

THE COURT: Excuse me.

MR. KELLY: Said we will undertake the obligation then return him when
requested by the defense rather than upset our order of proof at this
time.

THE WITNESS: Judge. May I say something, Your Honor? I will return
voluntarily if they want me to come back. I mean, I'm not -- I'm not
hostile to anybody.

THE COURT: All right. Then you will defer until the plaintiff
completes their case and your ordered to return upon the -- upon
request of either counsel.

THE WITNESS: Absolutely, Your Honor. I'm not -- I'm not hostile to
anyone.

MR. MEDVENE: Thank you very much, Your Honor.

(At 3:30 P.M., an adjournment was taken until Monday, November 4,
1996, at 8:30 A.M.)

REPORTER'S DAILY TRANSCRIPT
NOVEMBER 4, 1996

SUPERIOR COURT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA
FOR THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES

SHARON RUFO, ET AL., N/A, PLAINTIFFS,

VS.

ORENTHAL JAMES SIMPSON, ET AL., DEFENDANTS.

SANTA MONICA, CALIFORNIA
MONDAY, NOVEMBER 4, 1996
8:40 A.M.

DEPARTMENT NO. WEQ
HON. HIROSHI FUJISAKI, JUDGE

(REGINA D. CHAVEZ, OFFICIAL REPORTER)

MR. LAMBERT: Morning, Your Honor.

THE COURT:

MR. PETROCELLI: Couple of housekeeping items.

Mr. Lambert will address the court.

MR. LAMBERT: Thank you, Your Honor.

One thing this morning, we intend to read into evidence some requests
for admissions. And what I've done, Your Honor, is, I have them set
forth in little packets, one each for a question and an answer, which
I'll read to the jury.

And I would ask the Court to also let us mark those as exhibits so
they can become part of the record of the case.

Secondly, Your Honor, in regard to presumptive blood tests, I know
we've set a hearing for that before tomorrow morning on our two points
of waiver and, if necessary, Kelly Frye.

I just want to alert the Court to the fact that one of the witnesses
who will testify today, Dennis Fung, is the person who would
ultimately testify to doing some presumptive blood tests. So I would
simply ask the Court to allow me to reopen with Dennis, if the Court
decides tomorrow morning that presumptive tests will be allowed into
evidence, and I'll put him back on for that limited purpose then.

It is also my understanding from the defense's position, that the only
thing they object to are positive presumptive tests where there is no
subsequent confirming test; that is, any other evidence relating to
presumptive tests is acceptable if they're agreed, that is.

MR. BLASIER: That's correct.

MR. LAMBERT: Finally, Your Honor, I want to put -- I'm going to put on
Greg Matheson before Dennis Fung. It's slightly out of order, but Mr.
Matheson has some scheduling problems, and so I'll put him on, and
then Dennis Fung.

THE COURT: Can I get a witness schedule?

MR. LAMBERT: Pardon me?

THE COURT: Aren't you supposed to be providing opposing party with a
schedule of witnesses 48 hours ahead of time.

MR. LAMBERT: I've given them all the witnesses.

THE COURT: You gave me the first list; you didn't give me one after
that.

MR. PETROCELLI: I didn't provide one to the Court. I will do so.

THE COURT: All right. Anything else?

MR. LAMBERT: That's it for me.

MR. KELLY: I'm sorry; one other thing while they're coming in with
regard to the end of the day Friday with Detective Vannatter. There
were two exhibits that had been stipulated as to their admissibility
already. I just want to move those in. And they were 387 and 721.

THE COURT: They're received.

(The instrument previously marked as Plaintiffs' Exhibit 387,
Coroner's Report, was received in evidence.)

(The instrument previously marked as Plaintiffs' Exhibit 721,
Coroner's SID Sign-in sheets, was received in evidence.)

MR. GELBLUM: The first witness will be a minute and a half. He is
tow-truck driver named Bernie Douroux, who is unavailable. We intend
to read a portion of his criminal trial testimony.

I'd like to have Mr. Foster read the answers and I'll read questions,
and that way -- if that's acceptable to the Court.

THE COURT: Okay. If there's no objection.

MR. BAKER: I'd like something showing that he's unavailable. I haven't
seen any showing that he's unavailable.

MR. GELBLUM: I have a declaration.

MR. BAKER: Let me see it.

(Pause in proceedings.)

THE COURT: Which witness?

MR. GELBLUM: Bernie Douroux, Your Honor.

MR. BAKER: The only thing I don't see in here, he was apparently
served with a subpoena when he was supposed to be here.

MR. GELBLUM: The subpoena, I believe, was possibly for the first day
of trial:

MR. BAKER: A body attachment ought to issued for this man. This is not
--

MR. GELBLUM: Your Honor, this is literally a minute and a half,
chain-of-custody witness. I don't think there's any doubt about any of
his testimony. We ought to be able to read it in.

MR. BAKER: I see. The form, since it's short, we can disregard the
law; that's a good idea.

MR. GELBLUM: I think we established his unavailability, Your Honor.

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, if he's going to read that, we want to read the
cross-examination.

THE COURT: I haven't even finished reading this thing --

MR. BAKER: I'm sorry.

THE COURT: -- you know.

(Pause in proceedings.)

THE COURT: Go ahead.

MR. BAKER: A body attachment ought to issued for him if he's
unavailable, if he's been served with a subpoena, in violation of the
subpoena.

MR. GELBLUM: We're prepared to go ahead today. We did what we could
do.

I think all the law requires us to do is serve him a subpoena, try to
get him here. As the declaration established, we couldn't get him
here. That makes him unavailable under the code and allows us to bring
him in under the hearsay rule for prior testimony.

We have no objection to them reading in anything, as long as it's not
objectionable.

THE COURT: All right; you may do so.

MR. GELBLUM: Thank you, Your Honor.

(Jurors resume their respective seats.)

(The following proceedings were held in open court, in the presence of
the jury.)

THE COURT: Morning, ladies and gentlemen.

JUROR: Good morning.

THE COURT: I appreciate the fact that you all get up so early and get
to the court building on time. As often happens, the attorneys want to
discuss some things out of your presence, and they generally deal with
matters of law, and they are matters that should not be discussed in
your presence.

For that reason, we occasionally have to start late, like we are
starting late today; so I apologize for that.

All right. Plaintiff may proceed.

MR. GELBLUM: Your Honor, as you know, we are going to begin by reading
in some trial testimony from the criminal trial, of a man named Bernie
Douroux.

To make it a little easier for the jury to follow, we're going to ask
our associate, Mr. Foster, to take the stand and read the responses.

THE COURT: You may.

MR. GELBLUM: Your Honor, he was -- Mr. Douroux obviously was sworn in
at the criminal trial. I don't know if you want to do that with Mr.
Foster here on the stand.

THE COURT: Ladies and gentlemen, this is testimony given at the
previous trial; it was given under oath, and you're to treat it just
as though that person was called, sworn and testified.

Go ahead.

(The following testimony of Bernie Douroux was read into the record,
with Mr. Gelblum reading the questions, and Mr. Foster reading the
answers.)

"Q. Can you spell your first and last names for the record.

A. Bernie Douroux, B-E-R-N-I-E D-O-U-R-O-U-X.

A. Ford Bronco.

Q. Okay. The Ford Bronco that's been on --

A. Yes.

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And did you tow that Ford Bronco?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Did you touch it prior to hooking it up to your tow truck?

A. Not prior, but after I hooked it up, I did touch the front right
tire, to make sure it was locked -- the steering column was locked.

Q. Can you tell whether or not the Ford Bronco was locked?

A. Yes, it was locked, because it had little -- the buttons were down
on the Bronco.

4:40, 4:30."

MR. GELBLUM: I have nothing further.

THE COURT: Cross.

(The following testimony of Bernie Douroux was read into the record,
with Mr. Gelblum reading the questions, and Mr. Foster reading the
answers.)

MR. P. BAKER: Page 26269, line 9 -- we're at line -- through line 13.

"Q. With regard to your towing of this vehicle, as I understand it,
this took place on or about June 13, 1994 in the afternoon; is that
correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. And can you tell the ladies and gentlemen of the jury what time you
received a call in response to this, sir?

A. We received a call in the mike room -- LAPD mike room at
approximately 3:06.

Q. Then you responded to that call and arrived at the location on
Rockingham?

A. Yes, sir, around 3:31.

Q. All right. Around 3:31 in the afternoon?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And when you got to that location, was the media present at that
time, sir?

A. Yes, they were.

Q. And did you see a lot of media there?

A. Yes, there was.

Q. While you were there at Rockingham, did you ever see a lady walk up
or run up and touch this vehicle while you were there?

A. I -- not myself, no.

Q. You never saw that personally?

A. No.

Q. Did you become aware of that at some point?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection, Your Honor. Hearsay.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. So you learned about it afterwards; is that correct?

A. Yes.

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. Hearsay.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. With regards to this particular vehicle, prior to the time that you
started preparing it for towing, did you have occasion to look at that
vehicle -- exterior of that vehicle at all?

A. No, I didn't. Just after I hooked it up, just to make sure it was
nothing -- there was nothing -- there wasn't full-time four-wheel
drive.

Q. You described for us that you touched I guess the front wheel part
of the vehicle; is that correct?

A. Yes, sir, the front right tire.

Q. Did you have occasion to look at any of the doors of that vehicle
at all?

A. No, I didn't.

Q. And you didn't notice anything on the exterior of that vehicle that
you can recall presently; is that correct?

A. No, sir.

Q. Did you have occasion to look at the driver's side door down by the
sill, down at the bottom of that particular vehicle?

A. No, sir.

Q. You never looked at that?

A. No, sir.

Q. Did you look -- Did you see what appeared to be any coffee-cup
stains on the hood of that vehicle?

A. No, sir.

Q. You didn't see that, either?

A. No.

Q. All right. So I understand, this is a fairly routine tow for you at
this time; is that correct?

A. Yes, sir; it was.

Q. The only different (sic) missing (sic) from this scene from other
scenes is that there was a lot of media present; is that correct?

A. That was it, yes.

Q. You were working that day -- by yourself that day, sir?

A. There was -- there was three other drivers that day. I was the only
one that got dispatched to the call.

Q. When you say "three other drivers" three other drivers who
responded to the call?

A. No, no, just on the shift.

Q. Working for Rheuban's that day?

A. Yes.

Q. You responded to a call, and when you got there at Rockingham, at
or about 3:30 in the afternoon, you were the only driver there; is
that correct? (sic)

A. That's correct.

Q. All right. You talked to a police officer once you got to the
Rockingham location, did you?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. And you know the name of that police officer?

A. I can't remember his name, no.

Q. Was this police officer in civilian clothes, or was he in uniform?

A. He was in civilian, the one who instructed me where to take the
Bronco was.

Q. He was in what?

A. In civilian clothes.

Q. You don't know his name?

A. No. No, sir, I don't.

Q. All right. At any rate, you then proceeded, as I understand your
testimony, to hook this vehicle up and then to transport it downtown;
is that correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. And it was your understanding that you were going to meet a
detective somewhere in or about the print shed?

A. That's correct.

Q. Is that correct?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And then you described for us that it took you perhaps an hour or
more to drive easterly, downtown to Parker Center to the print shed;
is that correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. Where is the print shed located, sir, downtown here in LA?

A. Directly behind Parker Center, on San Pedro Street.

Q. All right. You went to that location, and did you see any detective
when you first went there?

A. No, I didn't.

Q. All right. So how long did you wait at that location?

A. Approximately ten minutes. Ten, fifteen minutes.

Q. All right. And what time was that by now?

A. I would say about 3:30, 3:40, somewhere around that time. Let's
see. No, no. That's about 4:30, 4:40 around that time, about an hour
after I left Rockingham.

Q. All right. So 4:30, 4:40?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. All right. Did you talk to anybody at the print shed when you first
got there?

A. There was nobody there.

Q. All right. Nobody. It was like locked?

A. Yes.

Q. All right, sir. So you waited about ten minutes. And then
thereafter, as I understand your testimony, you drove around to Parker
Center; is that correct?

A. That's correct, to the front of Parker Center.

Q. And you were by yourself at that point, so when you went in to try
to locate the detective, you left the vehicle on the street; is that
correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. And so how long were you away from that vehicle when you left it?

A. Approximately three minutes, just to go inside.

Q. All right. Now, what street did you park the vehicle on, sir?

A. Los Angeles.

Q. On Los Angeles Street?

A. Yes, sir. Right.

Q. And is that in front of Parker Center?

A. That's correct.

Q. Out on the street. So you would be heading northbound on Los
Angeles?

A. I thought it was eastbound.

Q. Well, you're on Los Angeles Street, right?

A. Yeah. I was directly in front of Parker Center, in front of the
doors. So I thought it was eastbound, maybe.

Q. All right. You headed toward Union Station, did you?

A. That's correct.

Q. Towards Olvera Street?

A. Yes.

Q. So let's call that north, now.

A. Okay.

Q. All right. And you parked the car -- parked your vehicle there and
your vehicle; is that correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. And you left it and then you went inside Parker Center, in the
front doors of Parker Center?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. When you left the vehicle to go inside, the media was outside,
also?

A. Yes, they were.

Q. Can you approximate for the Court and jury how many members of the
media were there, sir?

A. It was a group. I couldn't -- maybe 10, 15 more.

Q. A group, like a pack of media?

A. Yeah. They're all hanging out on the lawn.

Q. A Pack? How about a swarm, a swarm of media, Your Honor? So how
many would -- how many would --

A. I would say probably about ten, maybe more.

Q. All right. So ten -- about ten different cameras and that sort of
thing?

A. Yes, exactly.

Q. And how far away were they from you at the time that you went
inside when you left the vehicle to go inside Parker Center?

A. It was about 15 yards.

Q. Fifteen yards away?

A. Yes.

Q. And then -- you then left the vehicle and went inside is; is that
correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. And you went inside to try to find a detective; is that correct?

A. I went inside and I asked the desk sergeant there, the person in
charge, I had a Bronco with me from 360 Rockingham. He called upstairs
and told me that a detective was on his way down.

Q. All right. And then that's kind of at the front desk when you walk
inside Parker Center; it's at the front desk there inside?

A. That's correct.

Q. And during this time while you were inside, there was nobody
outside with the Bronco at this point; is that correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. All right. So your best recollection is, you stayed inside for --
how long did you -- strike that. Did you wait for the detective
inside?

A. No, sir, I didn't.

Q. All right. After you talked with this desk sergeant and you were
told that a detective would be coming down, did you go back outside
then?

A. That's correct; I did.

Q. All right. And then you walked back outside to the vehicle?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. All right. And I presume it was still parked at the same place; is
that right?

A. Yes, it was.

Q. And did you wait outside on the sidewalk at that point?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. When you went back outside to wait for the detective, how long did
you wait before a detective came out?

A. About three minutes.

Q. All right. And --

A. Less than five minutes.

Q. Less than five minutes?

A. Yes.

Q. During that period of time, Mr. Douroux, did you have occasion to
look at exterior of the Bronco at all at that point?

A. No, sir.

Q. So up to the time that you left that particular vehicle on June 13,
1994, you never had occasion to visually inspect the exterior of that
vehicle. Is that a fair statement?

A. Yeah. Just, I mean, took a quick glance, see that there was no
damages, and that was it.

Q. Did you have to log on any particular form whether or not there
were damages at any place on that particular --

A. It's usually marked on this when we look. We can look over the
vehicle, make sure there's no damages on the vehicle. If there are, we
mark them down on the impound sheet.

Q. That's called some sort of inventory, this sheet that you have
before you?

A. Yes.

Q. And in completing this particular inventory form, for instance,
there are -- the form is called inventory in the middle of the
particular form; is that correct? Inventory?

A. Well, right. Right here it says remarks that's where we put all the
-- all the damages down.

Q. Okay. And you have a "Y" column. I presume that's for yes and an
(sic) "N" column for no; is that correct?

A. That's correct.

(Counsel hands document to witness.)

Q. Did you fill this form out?

A. No, sir; that was already filled out by the LAPD.

Q. It was filled out by the LAPD --

A. Yes, sir.

Q. -- when you got the form?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. Where did you get that form?

A. From the LAPD, on Rockingham.

Q. When you first arrived there?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. All right. So that we're clear.

MR. P. BAKER: Then he offers to approach.

If we can look at the exhibit, this would be next in order. It was
criminal Exhibit 234.

MR. BAKER: Why don't you put it on the --

THE CLERK: 2112.

MR. GELBLUM: Your Honor, it's already been marked on that list as 271.

THE CLERK: 271. Thank you.

(The instrument herein referred to as LAPD investigation impound
report was marked for identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 271.)

THE REPORTER: Excuse me; does that mean it's not 2112?

THE CLERK: Correct; it's 271.

MR. P. BAKER: 26281, Line 11.

(The following testimony of Bernie Douroux was read into the record,
with Mr. P. Baker reading the questions, and Mr. Foster reading the
answers.)

Q. These were filled out by someone else; is that correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. Did you fill out any portion of this form at all?

A. Just the part here, where my signature and the tow fee and the
storage fee.

Q. All right. You filled out just the part where it indicates, 'Garage
employee complete this section,' and where it says 'Garage employee
signature?'

A. That's correct.

Q. That's your signature, and your name is Bernie Douroux?

A. Douroux, yes, sir.

Q. All right. All right. Anything else filled out?

A. No. That's it.

Q. All right. And so with regard to the inventory on the vehicle you
quickly looked at it; is that correct?

A. That's correct, just the exterior, just to make sure there were no
damages, which there were none.

Q. You mentioned also, sir, that at some point, you had occasion to
glance inside the vehicle; is that correct?

A. Yes, sir, just the front, the window, just to look to see if --
four-wheel drive vehicles sometimes are full-time four-wheel-drive
vehicles, so we have to make sure they're not engaged, which I didn't
see anything when I glanced, so I didn't bother looking.

Q. And where were you when you glanced inside the vehicle?

A. On the right-hand side, passenger side.

Q. All right. And more specifically, what location were you at?

A. Oh, in the front.

Q. No. What where were you, at Rockingham or --

A. Oh, yes. Yes. I'm sorry. Yes, Rockingham.

Q. So as I understand it, then you looked inside the vehicle while you
were still at 360 Rockingham?

A. Yeah. We just glanced in and looked.

Q. You did this from the passenger side of the vehicle?

A. That's correct.

Q. Pardon me. And you did this from the passenger side of the vehicle;
is that correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. And you don't recall seeing anything that you noted inside that
particular vehicle; is that correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. All right. This would have been shortly after you arrived, about
3:30 in the afternoon?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. So you looked inside. All right. Now, when you went back outside,
after talking to the desk sergeant, you waited for a period of time,
perhaps less than five minutes, and a detective came out; is that
correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. You know the name of that detective, sir?

A. No, I don't remember it.

Q. And you talked briefly with that detective? You had a conversation
with that person?

A. Yeah. Weather.

Q. You talked about the weather?

A. Yeah, weather, and how -- because it was a nice, warm day. Other
than that, no, no conversation.

Q. June 13 was a warm day?

A. It was.

Q. All right. After you had that conversation with the detective, did
you then take the vehicle back over to the print shed?

A. Yes, we took it over there. He got in the truck and we went down to
the print shed.

Q. So the detective rode with you?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. All right. You went back to the print shed. And at that time, you
gained Entrance into the print shed; is that correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. And you, I presume, took the vehicle inside and parked at some
location?

A. That's correct. I backed it in and parked the vehicle.

Q. About what time was it at this time, sir?

A. Oh, maybe a quarter of five, maybe almost five, by that time.

Q. Somewhere around 5 o'clock in the afternoon?

A. I believe it was before five.

Q. All right. And then -- and you then left the vehicle; is that
correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. While you were there, did you ever see any -- any person get inside
that vehicle at all?

A. No, sir.

Q. Did you ever get inside it?

A. No, sir.

Q. By the way, do you carry -- in the course of your work as a
tow-truck driver, do you have one of these things called a slim jim?

A. Yes, sir, I do.

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. Relevance, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled. (READING)

Q. That is the kind of instrument that works to open vehicles; is that
correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. With regard to that slim jim, you could open that vehicle real
quickly, couldn't you?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. Vague, "real quickly."

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. Yes, I could.

Q. In other words, you're an experienced tow-truck driver?

A. Yes.

Q. How long would it take you to -- using your slim jim, to open a
vehicle like that Bronco?

A. Couple of minutes if I had to open it.

Q. If you wanted to open it, couple of minutes?

A. Yes.

Q. Did you see whether or not the detective who rode back over with
you to Parker Center, did you see whether or not he had a slim jim
with him?

A. I didn't notice one, no.

Q. And did you ever see the detective open the vehicle while you were
there?

A. No, sir.

Q. And you then left the vehicle and that ended your involvement with
the vehicle on that day; is that correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. With regard to the form that's before you, again, Defense 271 --
Exhibit 271. You were asked whether or not there was any indication on
the form of whether or not this vehicle was locked and you indicated
there's no -- there was no indication one way or the other; is that
correct?

A. That's correct. I really didn't even notice the part of -- up
there.

Q. So look at it now for me, will you?

A. Yes. I'm looking at it.

Q. And the area called stolen, lost or embezzled, there's an
indication, the right part of that lock that -- or whether or not the
ignition was locked, right?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. Relevance, Your Honor. This call is not stolen
lock or embezzled.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. P. BAKER:

(READING)

Q. There's an indication whether the doors are locked. There's nothing
indicated, right?

MR. GELBLUM: Same objection.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. P. BAKER:

(READING)

Q. You then left the print shed and it was about 5 o'clock or so that
afternoon?

A. About 5 o'clock, yes, sir.

Q. And what time did you check out that day from your -- terminate
your employment that day, if you recall?

A. 7 o'clock.

Q. And did you pick up any other vehicles on that day before you -- on
that day that you recall?

A. Before or --

And there's an objection.

THE COURT: Sustained.

(READING)

A. Before -- a few cars before.

MR. P. BAKER: 26289, line seven.

(READING) Did you write any other notes with regard to any of your
observations on that -- on that particular day other than your
signature on exhibit 271 for identification?

A. No, sir that's it. Just that --

Q. Pretty much it?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And with regard to your observations or lack thereof of things
either outside the Bronco or inside the Bronco that you saw? Did you
write those down anywhere at all?

A. No, sir.

Q. And you never saw anything inside the interior of that vehicle; is
that correct?

A. No.

Q. Never saw any blood inside that vehicle?

A. No, sir.

Q. Never saw any blood on the outside of that vehicle?

A. No, sir.

Q. Did you see anything in the rear of the vehicle at all that you
recall?

A. No, sir.

MR. P. BAKER: Nothing further.

MR. GELBLUM: I have nothing, Your Honor.

truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

THE WITNESS: I do.

THE CLERK: Please be seated. And sir, if you please state and spell
your name for the record.

THE WITNESS: Gregory Matheson, G-R-E-G-O-R-Y, M-A-T-H-E-S-O-N. DIRECT
EXAMINATION BY MR. LAMBERT:

Q. By whom who are you employed Mr. Matheson?

A. By the city of Los Angeles.

Q. And what is your occupation?

A. My current position is Chief Forensic Chemist, Assistant Laboratory
Director of the criminalistics laboratory of the Los Angeles police
department.

Q. Is that part of the scientific investigation division?

A. Yes, it is.

Q. Were you employed on June 13, 1994?

A. Only June 13, 1994, I was not in my current position. I was the
supervisor of the serology trace and field units of the scientific
investigation division.

Q. And you've since then been promoted?

A. Yes.

Q. When did you first join the scientific investigation division?

A. I was hired by the city as a criminalist in June of 1978.

Q. And have you worked as a criminalist with the city through various
positions since that time?

A. Yes, I have.

Q. When did you first become aware of an investigation into the
murders of Ronald Goldman and Nicole Brown Simpson?

A. Sometime approximately about 7:45 on the morning of Monday, June
13.

Q. Did you play any role in the work of the scientific investigation
division in that investigation?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. What role did you play?

A. Well, initially my role, as I mentioned earlier at this time was --
I was supervisor of the serology trace and field units within the
laboratory and as supervisor of the field units in particular. I was
assigned to oversee the field work, the evidence that was brought in,
working a little bit of triage; determining what items would be
analyzed, initially overseeing and coordinating the case.

Q. And as part of that initial role that you played, did you assign
anyone within the serology department to do any work on the
investigation?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. And who did you assign?

A. A criminalist by the name of Collin Yamauchi.

Q. And when did you assign him to do that work?

A. I believe that was the afternoon of Monday, June 13.

Q. And what did you direct Mr. Yamauchi to initially do in the case?

A. Well, initially he needed to get together with the criminalist that
had checked the evidence out at the scene. And as a group, we went
through and looked at the items to determine which would be most
appropriate to analyze. He worked in the serology unit, so he was
going to be dealing with the biological evidence. The initial task was
to look at some of the items and see if we could exclude the parties
that were associated with the case at that point.

Q. Okay. And a decision was made to do certain test to see if parties
could be excluded?

A. That's correct.

Q. What tests did Mr. Yamauchi do to see if parties could be excluded?

A. Well within --

MR. BLASIER: Objection. No foundation.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: -- Serology unit. We chose to go with a type of DNA
testing utilizing PCR. PCR is a preparation technique for a marker
that goes by the initials of DQA or DQ alpha.

Q. (BY MR. LAMBERT) And those are the initial tests that you did on
these blood samples?

A. Yes, it is.

Q. Let me show you what's been marked as exhibit 216 in this case. Do
you recognize that exhibit, sir?

MR. BLASIER: May I look at that?

MR. LAMBERT: I gave it to you.

(The instrument herein referred to as a posterboard entitled "LAPD
Evidence Disposition" was marked for identification as Plaintiffs'
Exhibit No. 216.)

(Witness reviews exhibit 216.)

THE WITNESS: Yes, I do.

Q. (BY MR. LAMBERT) And we put the first page of it up on the
television set here. I don't know if you can see that very well, or
you might be able to see it better with the exhibit in it.

THE COURT: Is that the best you can do?

MR. LAMBERT: It's a little vague. There we go.

No, we won't be on it too long.

Q. Have you had an opportunity to review this exhibit prior to your
testimony today?

A. Yes, I have.

Q. Would you please describe what this exhibit is?

A. What it is, is a summary of a number of the evidence items that
were collected associated with this case; listed out by item number,
LAPD item number, a brief description of it, when the item was
collected and then the dates that it was submitted to one of three
outside agencies.

Q. And is that summary, summarized? Does that summary summarized other
reports and documents which underlie this exhibit?

A. Yes, it does.

Q. And what kind of reports in -- and other documents are in that
group of this that this document summarizes?

A. There are several different types of documents. They're all
prepared during the course of this case.

They're S.I.D. documents that are both typed and handwritten letters
of transmittal of the items to agencies, property reports, serology
description, notes, variety of different types of documents.

Q. And are these documents that are generated by the S.I.D. personnel
as part of their routine business?

A. Yes, that's correct.

Q. And have you had an opportunity to compare the underlying documents
to this summary to ensure that the summary accurately reflects the
underlying documents?

A. Yes, I do.

Q. Does it do so?

A. Yes. I went through each of the items, found the documents to
support it and the dates and information as accurate.

MR. LAMBERT: Your Honor, I move exhibit 216 into evidence.

MR. BLASIER: I object on foundational grounds, subject to a motion to
strike since this witness is out of order.

THE COURT: Received as business records.

(The instrument herein described as a posterboard entitled "LAPD
Evidence Disposition" was received in evidence as Plaintiff's Exhibit
No. 216.)

Q. (BY MR. LAMBERT) Now, you mentioned before that, part of your role
in this investigation was to sort of supervise some of the activities.
In that connection, did you participate in a meeting on June 29, 1994
in connection with this case?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. And who else participated in that meeting?

A. Well, present during it was myself, criminalist Yamauchi and my
supervisor, one of the assistant directors at the time, Michele
Kestler.

Q. And what was the purpose of that meeting?

A. The purpose of it was to look at the evidence items that we
currently had within S.I.D., to inventory them and determine the
quantity of each of the evidence items that were there.

Q. And at that point in time, did you have a fairly substantial number
of evidence items?

A. Yes.

Q. Was any actual examination of the evidence done at that meeting?

A. No. No malice was done, that's correct.

MR. BLASIER: Objection. Move to strike, nonresponsive.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MS. LAMBERT) Was any testing of any of the evidence done at
that meeting?

A. No.

Q. Like to show you -- why don't you take this off, please, Steve, and
put on -- is this 1302? Like to show you exhibit 1302.

(The instrument herein referred to as notes of summary analyzed
evidence was marked for identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No.
1302.)

Q. (BY MR. LAMBERT) Put the first page of that up.

(Mr. Foster complies.)

Q. Do you recognize that document, sir?

A. Yes, I do.

Q. Is that a document that you generated during the course of the
meeting?

A. Yes. The writing on it is mine.

Q. And what was the purpose of the document?

A. Well, again, it was to summarize the items that we currently had in
evidence.

You can see the item number on the left, a brief description of it. To
determine the quantity and then either the analysis types that we
expected to perform on it, what had been performed, whether or not
there was enough to do a split and then just miscellaneous comments.

Q. Like, take for example, item number 4 here and perhaps you can tell
us what this item is?

A. Well, as it's described, it's a swatch which I described as medium
to dark red. One of them being about 8 millimeters squared.

Q. If you could move it over for me, Steve. And all the way over.

(Indicating to TV screen.)

Q. (BY MR. LAMBERT) In the comments section here, what is it you said
about item number 4?

A. That it appeared from that one swatch, that 8 millimeter square
that there would be enough for the PCR analysis that I mentioned
earlier and conventional serology, but that if we went onto RFLP, that
would totally consume the sample.

Q. So your purpose in going through these various evidence items at
this meeting was to make determinations as to what you could do with
them in the future?

A. Right. It was to determine how much was there, and give a quick
idea, maybe a triaging of what some of the more important items are
and what the -- what analysis may eventually be formed on them if it
had not already been started.

MR. LAMBERT: Let's go to the second page now, Steve?

(Mr. Foster places on view screen second page).

Q. (BY MR. LAMBERT) Would you take a look now, Mr. Matheson, item
number 13, what is that item?

A. Item number 13, I've described as socks. I believe I put down here
navy blue or black.

Q. Um-hum. If you can move it over a little Steve.

(Mr. Foster complies.)

Q. (BY MR. LAMBERT) To the final column, what did you write in the
comments section?

A. In the comment section, I have in quotes dress socks, just another
description for them as opposed to athletic or something along that
line. That a blood search should be performed and also that no blood
was obvious or nonobvious.

Q. That's what this says nonobvious?

A. Yes.

Q. And so you're decision at that meeting was to later have someone do
a blood search?

MR. BLASIER: Objection. Leading.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: That's correct.

Q. Was there a blood search later done on the socks?

A. Yes, there was.

Q. And do you know whether that was done?

MR. BLASIER: Objection. Lack of foundation.

THE COURT: Lay a foundation.

Q. (BY MR. LAMBERT) Was that blood search later done under your
direction, sir?

A. Yes, it was.

Q. And did you direct some particular person to do it?

A. Yes, that's correct.

Q. And do you know when it was done?

A. I don't remember the exact date.

Q. Okay. It was done -- Do you know who it was done by?

A. Yes.

Q. Who was it done by?

A. Criminalist Yamauchi.

Q. Did he report back to you after he had done the blood search?

A. Yes, he did.

Q. And did he tell you whether he had discovered any blood during the
blood search.

MR. BLASIER: Objection. Hearsay.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. LAMBERT) During the time period after this meeting of June
29, 1994, and the time that you later had discussions with Collin
Yamauchi about his blood search, where were the socks kept?

A. In a box inside of the freezer which is located in the serology
unit of the laboratory.

Q. And during that time period, who had access to the evidence in the
serology room.

MR. BLASIER: Object. Lack of foundation.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. The laboratory has an electronic access system. That the doors are
all locked all the time and if you are allowed to have access to a
location or to the laboratory, you're given an electronic card of
which a computer has entered into it the number on that card, who it's
assigned to, where they're allowed to go within the laboratory at any
particular time or day of the week.

I'm explaining this because the access changes. During normal working
hours, all of the criminalists within the laboratory have access to
most of the areas within the lab.

In other words, they can get into narcotics, serology, blood, all the
different laboratories within the laboratory itself.

They have to have a card to have the door unlocked for them.

Off watch, the access becomes limited to a criminalist to their own
unit plus our stock room and our evidence room.

So during the day, during Monday through Friday, Friday normal working
hours excluding holidays, any of the criminologists that work in the
laboratory have access to serology. Obviously the administrative
management personnel do. There's a student working assigned to
serology that also has access to it.

Off watch, it would be limited to the criminalists that are assigned
to the serology unit and or management or -- and our management or
administration.

Q. Did any of the Los Angeles police department officers investigating
this case have access to the socks and the -- in the serology unit
during the time periods we're talking about.

MR. BLASIER: Objection. No foundation.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WTTNESS: They cannot get into any of the facilities without being
accompany by an S.I.D. personnel.

Q. (BY MR. LAMBERT) And have you reviewed the records to determine
whether anyone did have any access to the socks during the period
between the time you looked at them on June 29 and when Collin
Yamauchi later did his search?

A. The people that I mentioned have access to the room, would have
access to the freezer. There was no indication that any were or any
viewing was done on the socks during that time period.

Q. Was there any indication that any Los Angeles police department
officer had access to the socks at all during that time period?

A. Not that I can find.

Q. Now, let me put up another board, here. You can take that off
Steve, yeah.

(Mr. Foster complies, removes item from view screen.)

Q. (BY MR. LAMBERT) I don't know how well you can see that, Mr.
Matheson. You may have to get down to take a look at it.

(Indicating to board.)

Q. (BY MR. LAMBERT) My question to you, sir, were you, yourself,
involved in an examination of some portions of the Bronco that was
towed away from Mr. Simpson's property?

A. Yes, I was.

Q. And when did your examination take place?

A. I believe it was September 1, 1994.

Q. And where was that examination conducted?

A. It was conducted within the serology unit of the laboratory.

Q. Calling your attention to this exhibit, in particular to this
photograph on the bottom right corner here, would you tell us what
that depicts, please.

(Indicating to photo on board.)

THE WITNESS: What this photograph shows is the console unit that was
taken out of the Bronco. It's sitting on an examination table that we
have in the center of our serology unit. Papers underneath it to
protect it from the surface itself.

As you can see, there's also numbers that are on the console
indicating areas where material was removed off it or blood was
removed off of it.

Q. And did you in fact, take blood samples from these areas that are
marked with the little numbers in the photograph?

A. Yes. I collected blood from four separate areas on what would be
the right hand side of the console.

Q. Now, in collecting that blood, sir, did it appear to you that any
of that blood had previously been swatched as part of a collection
effort?

A. Yes, it did.

Q. Which portion appeared to you to have been previously swatched?

A. It was in the area on the console here as marked 303, and I believe
in the same area of 304.

Q. So you could tell by looking at those that someone had previously
wiped across the blood splatters there?

A. That's correct. You can see where a portion of them was -- you've
collected a number of samples. You can see when it's done there's like
a white mark. It doesn't completely remove the blood. It's apparent
that something else --

Q. Was it apparent to you that although this blood had been checked in
the past, there was sufficient left for you to do another collection?

MR. BLASIER: Objection. Leading.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: Yes, there was.

Q. And that's what you did?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, let's take a look at this picture while we're out here. Did
you also, on that same day, collect any further blood evidence from
another portion of the Bronco?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. And what was that from?

A. The carpet area that had been removed from the Bronco.

Q. Okay. This carpet area, is it -- it was sectioned out of the bottom
part of the Bronco?

A. Yes, it was cut out from the driver's floor board area.

Q. And do you know when that was cut out?

A. I believe it was on June 14, 1994.

Q. Was that by Dennis Fung?

A. Yes.

Q. And where had that piece of carpet been after it was cut out by
Dennis Fung before you did your work on September the 1st?

A. It was also maintained in a box in the freezer of the serology
unit.

Q. So on September the 1st, did you take that out of the box, out of
the freezer unit and in from your lab to do the work that you did on
it?

A. Yes.

Q. What was it that you did precisely?

A. I went and I removed some additional blood stain area of the fibers
in the carpeting by clipping them out and placing them in a what's
called a paper bindle to protect them.

You can see there are some clippings already in a bindle that's folded
up, taped and marked and initialed as to where it came from.

In addition to a stained area always collect what's called a control
or an unstained area of the same surface that the blood is on. So that
later on in the testing, you can find out whether or not this surface
itself is contributing to the result.

So what I did is collect a portion of the blood stain area here and a
control area that was in a as close as possible, but visually
unstained area of the carpeting.

Q. Those things that you checked there, did you give them item number
293?

A. Yes.

Q. So item number 293 is in fact pieces of the carpet that you cut out
that day?

A. That's correct.

Q. And do you know the item number of the carpet itself that was taken
from -- that was cut out?

A. Yes I believe it was 33.

Q. And these item numbers here 303, 304, 305 and 306, those are the
items numbers that you assigned to the blood that you checked off the
console?

A. Yes, it is.

MR. PETROCELLI: Your Honor, we're having technical difficulty with
this TV. Might we break shortly to see if he can fix it.

THE COURT: All right. Let's take ten minutes. Don't form any opinions
about the case.

(Recess.)

(Jurors resume their respective seats.)

(The following proceedings were held in open court, in the presence of
the jury.)

THE COURT: You may proceed.

MR. LAMBERT: Thank you, Your Honor.

Why don't you put that back up, please.

(Mr. Foster complies.)

DIRECT EXAMINATION (Continued) BY MR. LAMBERT:

Q. Mr. Matheson, we were talking before about this console in the
Bronco that you collected blood on. I wanted to be sure, because of
our technical problems, that we made this point clear.

Would you point out on this television screen here the items of
evidence which you collected from this Bronco console.

A. There are four separate areas where I collected blood off the
console: This one was marked 303; 304, which is a stain that covers
this area here; 305, down in the lower right-hand corner; and then
306, which appears it could be an extension of this stain, but went
ahead and collected it as a separate item.

Q. Of these items that you collected, which were the ones that appear
to you to have previously been swatched in a prior collection?

A. What I have marked as 303, the area up on the console lid here, and
304 on the right-hand rear side.

Q. And could you tell from looking at them that someone had previously
collected from those items?

A. That's correct.

Q. When you did this collection in your laboratory in serology, who
else was present?

A. I don't have the complete list with me. I was present; there were
people that were coming and going, some of the attorneys, that type of
thing.

But in addition, as far as technical-type staff, there were a Mark
Taylor and Larry Ragle that were working for the defense that were
observing and assisting on this.

Q. Those were Mark Taylor and Larry Ragle were experts look working
for Mr. Simpson?

A. Yes.

Q. They were there watching you do this collection?

A. That's correct.

Q. And the evidence items that you took off this, you then did what
with them, sir, the things that you took off the Bronco console?

A. Well, they were collected on swatches, which is the way we collect
blood samples, are allowed to dry, package up in the bindles like what
you saw in one of the previous photographs from the carpeting area.
You do the same thing with any small type of evidence.

The items placed in the bindle; the bindle's closed up, sealed, marked
as to where it came from, the time and the initials of who did it.
They're then packaged and booked into -- or placed into our property
division.

Q. Now, you mentioned when you were talking about the June 29 meeting
where you made the list of all the evidence items and what you were
going to do with them in the future, you mentioned the word "triage"
in connection with that.

Can you explain to us what you mean by "triage?"

A. Well, I believe it's mainly a medical term. It has to do with doing
the most important things first. Best example would be if there's a
big accident where you have a number of victims, obviously not all of
them can be dealt with at the same time; they go through what's called
a triaging program, where they decide who is the most injured, work
them first, and then go on down the line.

I used it -- There were many evidence items associated with this case.

We don't have the resources to analyze every item first, so you do a
triaging system; you go through, figure out -- or make the best guess
as to what you think are the most important items there that are going
to yield the most important information first. Eventually, as time and
resources become available, you come in and finish up the rest of the
items.

Q. And that's what you were doing that day with these evidence items
in this case?

A. That was part of it, yes.

Q. Now, let's talk a little bit about serology at SID.

You have been involved in serology there for some time?

A. Yes, since August of 1981.

Q. And prior to joining SID, what was your educational background?

A. Well, I got a degree, bachelor of science degree in criminology
from the California State University at Long Beach, and at the time
completed the course requirements for a bachelor of arts degree in
chemistry, though I never received that degree.

Q. And since the time that you joined SID, have you been actively
involved in serology work, at least since the time you went into the
serology department?

A. Yes. Like I said, I started in June of 1978.

In August of 1981, I was transferred into the serology unit as a
criminalist. At that time, I started learning the techniques that are
specific to our laboratory, and worked as a criminalist within that
unit doing case work: Homicide, sexual assaults, analyzing body
fluids, until about May of 1989, when I was promoted to supervisor of
that unit.

Q. And for how long were you the supervisor of the serology unit?

A. Well, of just the serology unit, I was a supervisor for about three
years. At a point approximately three, three and a half years later,
one of our other supervisors resigned and I was given a couple of
additional units.

Like I mentioned, at the time in June of 1994, I not only supervised
serology, but our trace comparative unit, which does hairs, fibers,
that type of thing, and the field unit, which is the criminalists who
go out and collect evidence from the scene.

Q. In terms of serology, what type of testing is done in the LAPD
serology department?

A. Well, there's a number of different type of techniques. They can be
broken down into two main groups that we've started calling
conventional serology and then DNA analysis.

To touch real quick on the DNA, there's a couple different types of
analysis there, an awful lot of initials: One of them goes by the
initials PCR, one by RFLP. Our laboratory only does PCR-type of DNA
analysis.

Q. In terms of conventional serology, could you describe a little bit
more what you mean by that?

A. Sure. Conventional serology is what I mainly worked as a
criminalist, or did work as a criminalist in that area. It's the
conventional or the serological type of test that's been used in a
variety of different disciplines for many, many years.

The best example of conventional serology would be ABO blood typing
used in hospitals a lot for transfusions. Everybody has an ABO type;
they're either type A, type B, type AB or type O. You fall into one of
those four categories.

That is one of the systems or genetic markers that we use in
conventional serology to try and make an association or an elimination
between a person and a blood stain or a semen sample.

In addition to the ABO, which has been around for decades, there are
techniques that involve enzymes. Enzymes are nothing more than another
chemical that's in your body similar to the ABO type, of which you
have certain types that we can put into groups.

An example of that is one of the enzymes that we look at goes by the
initials ESD -- it's a fairly long name; that isn't particularly
important. But you are either an ESD type 1, type 2, or type 2/1; you
fall into one of those groups. And you are the same type from the time
you're born until you die.

Q. Is there also a conventional serology typing called the PGM type?

A. Yes, there is. That's one of the other enzymes that we look at.

Q. Okay. Is it similar to the ESD type?

A. It is similar in that it's an enzyme; it performs a function in
your body. We can break it down either into a type 1, type 2, or type
2/1. Then you can do one additional step which breaks those three down
into what are called sub types, or about ten different possibilities,
rather than just three.

Q. So all of us have one of those ten different sub types?

A. Yes.

Q. Is there also an EAP type that you're familiar with?

A. Yes.

Q. And what is that?

A. Again, it's just another enzyme that performs a function in your
body, exists in a few more types. The examples being you're either
type B, A, C, A, BC, A. I mean, it's a combination of letters. But
each one of those designates a type, just again like in the ABO
blood-type system, you have a type from --throughout your life.

Q. And are all these conventional serology systems separate and apart
from DNA testing?

A. They're separate, in that you're testing for the enzyme itself, or
in the ABO group the antigens and the antibodies. They are different
tests and you get typed. They are connected in a way, and all of them
are based on your DNA.

Q. But if a person has a particular one of these types, that doesn't
necessarily mean what their DNA profile is going to be, does it?

A. They are independent from the DNA markers that we look at in
forensic science.

Q. Okay. Looking at these -- These four conventional types that you've
described, is there any way of determining how common or uncommon a
particular blood type is in the population, generally?

A. Yes.

Q. And how do you do that?

A. Like I mentioned, you have a blood type that is yours from the time
you're born till the time you die. By analyzing samples, you can find
out how much of a percentage of the population has a certain type.

For example, going back to the ABO blood typing system, approximately
half of the population -- a little bit less than that -- but
approximately half of the population is ABO type O.

The next most common is A, then B, then AB.

Within our laboratory, we've been doing this conventional type of
serology since we started the enzymes, I believe in 1977, but we've
been doing the ABO a lot longer. We store the information on all of
the victims and suspects that we've gotten. We do a blood sample that
comes in on somebody; we record what their types are. And over the
years, we've kept a chart and we know what percentage of the
population in the City of Los Angeles, among victims and suspects, is
a type O, type A, type B, or type AB.

Q. And is it possible that if you know all four of these different
blood types we've been talking about for a particular person or
evidence sample, to determine how common or uncommon it would be in
the general population to have that combination of all four types?

A. Yes.

Q. And how do you go about doing that?

A. Well, it's something called a product rule. It's just as simple as
you take the percentage of a type in one marker, like, let's say an
ABO type, we know that possibly half of the people in this room would
have that type; that is type O.

Then you go on to another marker and say -- let's see: We've used ESD
-- excuse me -- as an example. Let's say approximately 50 percent of
the population is a type 1. It's actually higher than that, but for
simplicity, let's stay with that.

If we have a stain that I know is ABO type O and ESD type 1, we'd
multiply 50 percent by 50 percent and come up with about 25 percent,
so we'd know now that approximately 25 percent, or one out of every
four people in this room, would have a combination of a type O ESD 1.
And you just keep doing that with each additional marker. You get a
little bit more information, it narrows down the pool of people that
could have left a stain.

Q. So if a person has an ABO type A, an ESD type 1, a PGM type 2 plus,
2 minus, and an EAP type BA, could you tell us how common in the
population would be the combination of those four blood types?

A. By taking each of those pieces of information, determining the
population or the percentage for each marker, and then multiply them
together, that combination of four comes out to about .17 percent of
the population. Or to put it in a little bit more understandable
terms, approximately one out of about 550 to 570 people would have
that complete combination of types.

Q. So in this case, evidence on the item 49, which was one of the
blood drops found at Bundy, had an ABO type A and ESD type 1, a PGM
type 2 plus, 2 minus an EAF type BA, how many people out of the
population could have been the person that left that blood drop there?

A. Given the information you gave me, again, it would be about .17
percent of the population, or approximately one out of every 550 to
570 people.

Q. And if Mr. Simpson had those same four blood types, would he then
be one of those, one out of 550 people who could have left that blood
type?

MR. BLASIER: Objection. Argumentative.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: He would be included in that group that could have left
that stain, yes.

MR. LAMBERT: Thank you. I have no further questions.

THE COURT: Mr. Blasier.

MR. BLASIER: Thank you.

CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. BLASIER:

Q. Morning, Mr. Matheson.

A. Morning.

Q. How are you today?

A. Good.

Q. We've had quite a few discussions, you and I, during the course of
the last two, two and a half years, have we not?

A. Yes, we have.

Q. Since Mr. Simpson was acquitted on October 3 of 1995, can you give
me a rough estimate of the total amount of time that you have spent on
the Simpson case?

A. Well, it's interspersed with an awful lot of other things. Of the
total time, oh, gosh, I don't know; probably 40 to 60 hours.

Q. And of that 40 to 60 hours, how much of that has been at the
request of the plaintiffs in this case?

A. And all of that includes just my personal preparation time and that
type of thing, where I was dealing specifically just with the
plaintiffs.

Q. Or doing work that the plaintiffs requested that you do?

A. Well, no additional work was done as far as analytical type of
work.

I don't know. I'd say probably 10 to 15, maybe. It's hard to estimate.

Q. You say that there's no additional analytical work. You mean there
was no additional testing or experimentation that you did on behalf of
the plaintiffs?

A. There was no additional testing as far as analysis on evidence
items.

Q. Experimentation?

A. Yes.

Q. There was no additional experimentation?

A. No. I'm sorry. There was an additional experiment that I ran.

Q. How much time did you devote to that experiment?

A. Actual work time, possibly a couple hours.

Q. Did you do that during the course of your county time?

A. Actually, I work for the city.

Q. City?

A. Some of it was, some of it wasn't. I came in on my own time, just
to check the results on something.

Q. And a think you said 10 to 15 hours you spent working with the
plaintiffs. Did I hear that correctly?

A. Well, no. I think again, these are very rough estimates. It has to
do with, you know, like, meeting with them, also things like that,
experiments that I'm talking about, performing a variety of just
organizational type of tasks.

Q. And let me ask you, have you ever, in the course of your career,
done an experiment for a private party to a civil action?

A. It's kind of an interesting thing. I mean, there's a question there
that needed to be answered. I'm not sure I did it just for the
plaintiff in this case.

To answer your question, I have not ever performed an experiment
specifically at the request of the plaintiff in a civil case.

Q. And this experiment that you performed was at the request of the
plaintiffs, correct?

A. It was a -- we brought up in my mind -- it was a question I wanted
to answer during the course of the criminal case, and never had the
time to do it. And during the course of discussions, I was reminded of
it and chose to perform it.

Q. There were many questions other than the one that dealt with that
experiment that were raised during the course of the criminal trial
with respect to the operations at your lab, were there not?

A. Yes, there was.

Q. Have you done any experiments, since Mr. Simpson was acquitted in
October of 1995, on any of those other issues?

A. No, I have not.

Q. How many meetings have you had with the plaintiffs' attorneys?

A. Are we talking solely with them, defense not being present?

Q. Correct.

A. Being spread out over the last many months, I'd have to say three
to five, something like that.

Q. And did you meet with them last night or this morning?

A. Not last night; this morning I did, yes.

Q. And how long did you meet with them?

A. About an hour and 15 minutes, something like that.

Q. Did they explain to you the parameters of your testimony?

A. Well, we did discuss the areas that we'd been covering, yes.

Q. Now, you did quite a bit of testing, yourself, in this case, did
you not, of conventional serological testing?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Now, Exhibit No. 216, which was the chart -- do you have that in
front of you?

A. Talking about the summary of --

Q. Correct?

A. -- items?

Q. Yeah.

A. Yes, I do.

Q. Now, you prepared that; is that correct?

A. No, I did not.

Q. Who prepared that?

A. It was provided to me by the plaintiff.

Q. So this is not a document generated by the Los Angeles Police
Department Scientific Investigation Division?

A. I did not generate it; that's correct.

Q. So this is not a business record; this is not a record that was
prepared by your agency, correct?

A. This particular document was not prepared by our agency, yes.

Q. When were you presented with this document?

A. I believe that was last Tuesday.

Q. And did you spend time going over the document and determining
whether it was accurate or not?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. How much time did you spend doing that?

A. Probably, if I added up all the little bits and pieces that I spent
in between other tasks, I don't know, maybe three to four hours,
something in there.

Q. And I take it you reviewed documents that were generated within
your lab to determine whether the information on the document was
accurate, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. Looking at page 2, number 17, that indicates number 17 is Mr.
Simpson's reference blood vial, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. Is it your understanding that that was the reference blood sample
taken by Nurse Thano Peratis at the jail hospital?

A. Yes, it is.

Q. That document indicates that Mr. Simpson's reference vial was given
item number 17, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Before I show you these documents, let me ask you a couple
questions about procedures for booking evidence into SID, or into LAPD
in general.

What is a DR number?

A. DR number, I believe it stands for division of records, something
like that. It is a case number. It's something that is assigned and
follows a case from beginning to end.

Q. Now, when is a DR number assigned in a case, generally?

A. Well, it's rarely involved in SID. I believe it's assigned when a
detective calls up, either records or the local station, and requests
the next number in line.

Q. And that's something that they can do, basically, from any location
at any time, once they start working on a case, correct?

A. Well, mechanically, I believe they can. I don't know what their
procedures are as to what time -- at what point it's supposed to
occur.

Q. I mean, all they need to do is call up on the phone and ask for the
next number that becomes the case number for that case?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Foundation.

THE COURT: Lay a foundation.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) You're aware of the procedure where DR numbers are
assigned to a case, as just indicated?

A. General procedures, yes.

Q. That involves calling up and saying, give me a number; this is
going to be the number for the case that I just started working on,
correct?

A. Yes. Except for I don't know what information they need to convey
when they get it.

Q. Okay. And once they get a number, all of the evidence that's
collected in a case is tied to that number; is that correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. Now, once they have a DR number, if a detective collects a piece of
evidence in the field that he wants to have booked, it goes in under
that number, correct?

A. That case number, yes, the DR number.

Q. If they have an item of evidence that he wanted to bring to SID,
what's the procedure for doing that?

A. Well, if he wanted the item analyzed, they would book it into
property division and normally request that somebody, in whatever unit
is going to pick up the evidence from property and bring it in and
analyze it.

Q. And that's done all the time, isn't it?

A. That's a regular procedure, yes.

Q. Now, when your criminalists are collecting and booking evidence in
the field, or collecting evidence in the field, there's a certain
amount of documentation that they're required to fill out as they do
their job, correct?

A. There's documentation, yes.

Q. And that documentation includes listing items that they collect or
observe, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And writing down information about those items' location, who
collected them, that sort of thing?

A. The "who collected them" isn't necessarily done at the scene; but,
yes, a location, a description.

Q. And items are given what are called item numbers as they are
collected, correct?

A. Not necessarily. They're given photo numbers. The item numbers
aren't assigned until after all the items are brought back to the
laboratory and the booking process or the packaging process occurs.

Q. Well, item numbers can be assigned in the field, as well, can they
not?

A. They can be, yes.

Q. Now, with respect to the evidence that was collected that's
reflected on this chart at the Rockingham location, the item number
that is listed in the left-hand side of the chart, here, 4 through 17,
those were all items numbers that were assigned by Dennis Fung and
Andrea Mazzola at the Rockingham crime scene, correct?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Foundation.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) You've reviewed the records that form the basis
for this chart, have you not?

A. Yes, I have.

Q. And that includes property records that correspond -- that have the
same items that correspond to the items that are described, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. And you reviewed records that relate to the items that were picked
up at Rockingham, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And let me show you what's previously been marked as Exhibit 212.

MR. BLASIER: Put this on the Elmo.

Let me give you a copy of it.

THE WITNESS: Thank you.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) That document is in Dennis Fung's handwriting, is
it not?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Foundation.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Excuse me. Lay a foundation.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) You are familiar with Dennis Fung's handwriting,
are you not?

A. Not to the point if I was given a lot of different handwriting, I
could pick it out.

Q. Does that appear to be his handwriting?

A. It appears.

Q. You've seen that document before, have you not?

A. I believe I have, yes.

Q. Now, that document case -- that item number 17 --

MR. BLASIER: Can we get that in better focus?

There you go.

Q. --is a pair of tennis shoes, correct?

A. That's what it reflects, yes.

Q. Those tennis shoes were collected, were turned over at a meeting
that you had on June 14, in the morning, by Detective Lange, correct?

A. That's possible. I don't specifically remember when we received
those.

Q. But you remember that you received those from Detective Lange the
morning after the crime scene was processed?

A. I believe so, yes. I don't know if I received them. They were
received in the laboratory.

Q. You were aware that Detective Lange had taken those tennis shoes
home overnight, correct?

A. I had subsequently heard that.

Q. Now, item number 18 on that document indicates that Mr. Simpson's
reference blood was given item number 18, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And it was listed there after the tennis shoes that were turned in
on the morning of the 14th, correct?

A. That's what this list shows, yes.

Q. I have this --

MR. BLASIER: This is a new exhibit.

Could I have a number, please?

THE CLERK: 2130.

MR. BLASIER: I'm sorry. 2130?

THE CLERK: (Nods affirmatively.)

(The instrument herein referred to as Serology item description notes
was marked for identification as Defendants' Exhibit No. 2130.)

Q. Let me show you 2130. I'll give you a copy; maybe you can see it a
little bit better.

A. Thanks.

Q. Now, you recognize that document, don't you?

A. Yes, I do.

Q. That's -- its title, serology item description notes, why don't you
tell me what that document is for?

A. This is used in a lot of different instances when a criminalist in
the serology unit is working on a case, where they receive the
evidence prior to analyzing it, this is one of the forms that's filled
out. It merely has the item number on the left-hand side, a brief
description of it, and then whether it was in a sealed condition when
they received it, those types of things. Those are notations and boxes
toward the right-hand side. You can't see them on the screen.

It's also kind of generally used as a note pad or a place just to
record notes within the serology unit.

Q. Now, directing your attention to the bottom, that is number 18 and
refers to Mr. Simpson's reference vial, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. And it was being referred to by that number on, according to that
document, June 14.

MR. BLASIER: Can we back out on that a little, Phil?

(Mr. P. Baker complies.)

THE WITNESS: That's correct.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) That's indicated by the dates on the right,
correct?

A. Yes. The day received is 6/14/94.

Q. Let me give you another exhibit, which I'll number 2131.

(The instrument herein referred to as document entitled Serology Case
Typing Summary DNA Analysis was marked for identification as
Defendants' Exhibit No. 2131.)

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Let me show you --

MR. BLASIER: Phil, can we back out on that a little bit?

(Mr. P. Baker complies.)

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Now, that is a document entitled Serology Case
Typing Summary DNA Analysis, correct?

A. Yes, it is.

Q. And you recognize that document, as well, do you not?

A. Yes, I do.

Q. And tell us what that document is for.

A. Okay. When a criminalist in serology unit is doing a DNA analysis,
this is the sheet in which they record their results. And normally, it
is one of the sheets that's used to write the analyzed evidence report
from.

Q. Okay.

MR. BLASIER: Can we zoom in on the left-hand column, lower column now.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) The last entry on that form indicates number 18 as
Mr. Simpson's reference vial, correct?

A. Yes, it does.

Q. That document is as of what date?

A. I believe it was started on June 14, 1994.

Q. Is there a completion date on that?

Do you have that in front of you?

A. It has a day completed, which refers, I believe, to the analysis of
June 17, 1994.

Q. So as of the 17th, according to that document, Mr. Simpson's
reference vial was still number 18, correct?

A. I don't believe that's what this says.

Q. What does the No. 1 indicate?

A. The item number 18 that's on there would be the item number which
the -- when the evidence was received by Mr. Yamauchi, when the
analysis was started.

Q. At some point in time, the number on Mr. Simpson's reference vial
was changed from 18 to 17, was it not?

A. Yes, it was.

Q. That's because had it been number 18, that would have indicated
that it was booked on the morning of the 14th, after the tennis shoes,
correct?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Argumentative.

THE COURT: Sustained`

Q. BY MR. BLASIER: That was done because the records indicated, as
item number 18, it was booked -- it was collected by Dennis Fung after
the tennis shoes on the morning of the 14th, correct?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Argumentative.

THE COURT: Sustained.

You may ask the question.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Why was 18 changed to 17?

A. On this specific item, I don't know.

Q. You have no idea?

A. No. Item numbers and photo numbers do regularly get changed for a
variety of reasons, including simplicity of putting things in order.
If you notice, also on this page is two other item numbers, I believe
107 or 109 turned out to be in the 40 range.

Q. Those numbers refer to photo I.D. numbers, do they not?

A. Yes, they do.

Q. You're talking about the first two comments that say looks like 107
and maybe 109?

A. Something like that, yes.

Q. That wasn't the item number they were given; that was the photo
I.D., correct?

A. At this point, it was the number that was indicating that item, but
it was not the property number, because they are not necessarily
related.

Q. So that's why those numbers became a different number, because they
were given a different item number on the property report, correct?

A. From the photo number, yes. That was an example I gave as to how it
can change.

Q. Now, item 18, however, was given that number in sequence after the
tennis shoes, which were item 17, correct?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Foundation.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Lay a foundation.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) We looked at the document before that showed item
17 as the tennis shoes and item 18 as the blood sample, correct?

A. We saw a document that had that on it, yes.

Q. That's document number 212, correct?

A. It's the one we looked at earlier, yes.

Q. All right. This is done by Dennis Fung at the time he receives the
items, correct?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Foundation

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Is that a document prepared in the regular course
of business in your agency?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Foundation.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: It's a plain white piece of paper that has three lines of
text written on it. I don't know specifically when it was filled out
by Dennis.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) So now is it your testimony that you have no idea
when that item number was changed to 17?

A. I do have some idea. I know it was changed sometime from when
Criminalist Fung received it and when the property report was filled
out.

MR. BLASIER: Let me mark a new exhibit next in line.

THE CLERK: 2132.

(The instrument herein referred to as Copy of a follow-up
investigation report was marked for identification as Defendants'
Exhibit No. 2132.)

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Let me show you Exhibit 2132.

MR. BLASIER: Can you zoom in on that a little bit.

(Referring to TV screen.)

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) That's a document that's called a follow-up
investigation report, correct?

A. Yes, it is.

Q. And that's a document that was prepared specifically to change the
item number of Mr. Simpson's reference blood from 18 to 17, correct?

A. No, it isn't.

Q. What is it for?

A. This was the form in general that is used to correct information
that appeared on a previously submitted form, department form.

This particular one was prepared by Mr. Yamauchi, not to change the
item number on the item itself, but rather, to reflect a change of the
item number on his analyzed evidence report that he prepared.

Q. It says "change item number 18 to item number 17," correct?

A. On his analyzed evidence report, correct, not on a property report
or anything that Mr. Fung had prepared.

Q. And why was that necessary?

A. Because when Mr. Yamauchi started the analysis on these items, he
was under the belief that the blood was going to be item number 18, so
to have a number, follow it through, that's what he recorded all the
way through.

At some point, it was determined that the whole blood would become
item number 17, which became the official number for that title on the
department property report. At that point, it would have been very
confusing for Mr. Yamauchi's report to reflect 18, when the actual
item number or property number was 17, so he put through an official
change to make that correction.

Q. Now, the date of this change was what? June 28, was it not?

A. This form, or the report was dated June 28, that's correct, 1994.

Q. And it was signed by you, was it not?

A. Yes.

Q. Why was it necessary to change the blood in item number 18 for item
number 17?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Misstates the testimony, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

I don't understand your objection.

THE WITNESS: I don't know. That's something that Mr. Fung will have to
answer.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Can you tell me whether there is any other item in
these several hundred items that were collected, that were given an
item number by the criminalist that was later changed?

A. By the criminalist or by SID?

As I mentioned earlier, there were many other items that received an
initial number that eventually ended up getting changed on the
property report.

Without going through all 450 or 500, I can't answer specifically if
there was ones that were given an item number and then given a
different item number.

To me, an item number occurs when the property is booked. Prior to
that, it's some sort of reference number, be it one in order or a
photo number. The item number is what appears on the property report.

Q. Are you aware of any single document, a checklist that gives items
numbers as filled out by the criminalist when they collect the
evidence, where it's assigned a number and that item number was
changed? Can you give me a single example?

A. Are we talking about this --

Q. This case.

A. I have not gone through and reviewed all of the stuff in the notes.
At this point, I can't remember if there was one or not.

Q. Do you remember seeing any other follow-up investigation report
like 2132 in this case, changing an item number?

A. Yes. As a matter of fact, I filled one out that changed because I
made a typographical error, filled out a 314, which is what this
report is called, making a correction to one of my reports in an item
number.

Q. Which one was that?

A. Had to do with, I believe, the property report I filled out,
collecting items associated with the Bronco pieces taken to the
laboratory.

Q. And which item are you thinking about?

A. Well, in the body of the report -- if I can refer to the report, I
can give you the exact numbers.

Q. Sure.

A. Okay.

In the property report, I refer to item No. 306 as a hair fiber
collected from the same location as 306/30. That's a typographical
error. Obviously, the item that it can become couldn't have come from
itself. I filled out this exact same form correcting the item, this
number that appears in the description, so it reads item 306 hair
fiber collected from the same location as No. 303/30.

This form is used for corrections like that.

Q. Okay. But that was because there had already been the number 30
assigned to that; you just wrote it down correct. You had to conform
what you wrote to what the item number that had already been assigned
to that item, correct?

A. That's correct; it was a correction.

Q. Are you aware of any instance where an item number that was
assigned by a criminalist for an item that was collected at any of
those crime scenes was changed, other than Mr. Simpson's reference
vial?

A. Well, again, we're getting into a discussion of when it becomes an
item number.

The item number is what's on the property report. I don't believe any
of them were changed after the fact, once it made into a property
report.

I know of no other ones, other than the photo I.D.s that I mentioned
earlier, that got changed, again, between the description number and
eventually the item number on the property report.

Q. Well, that's the chart number 216, again, the summary chart
prepared by the plaintiffs. You see on the left-hand column of that
where it has LAPD item number?

A. Yes, I do.

Q. Isn't it accurate that every single item number, with the exception
of 17, Mr. Simpson's reference vial, has a number assigned by the
criminalist in their original paperwork as the item that was
collected?

A. No.

Q. Point to one that is not.

A. All the items that were checked at Bundy were given an item number
or descriptor number based on the photo numbers that were eventually
changed to put them in order in a logical position on a property
report. Changing numbers is not a terribly uncommon situation.

Q. Well, the items that refer to the blood drops that were collected
at Bundy, they were given photo I.D. numbers, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. That's because of the order in which the photographs were taken;
when they put the little cards on the ground, they give it that
number, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. When evidence was started to be collected at Rockingham, Dennis
Fung started numbering item numbers sequentially as he collected
items, correct?

A. The photo numbers and eventually they made it -- they happen to
match when he did the property report.

Q. Is there a photo number for Mr. Simpson's reference vial?

A. I don't believe so, no.

Q. So we're not talking about a photo I.D. number that had been
changed with respect to Mr. Simpson's vial, are we?

A. No.

Q. Now, on that chart, I want to direct your attention to number 84.
Number 84 refers to fingernail scrapings from Nicole Brown Simpson,
correct?

A. Yes, it does.

Q. This is done as a routine procedure by the coroner, collecting
scrapings from under a victim's fingernails, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. That's to determine whether there might be blood or skin from a
person that was scratched, correct?

A. I believe that's the reason, yes.

Q. You did serological testing on those samples, did you not?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Beyond the scope.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Were you told by the plaintiffs that you weren't
going to be asked any questions about any testing you did?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Hearsay, irrelevant.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Mr. Matheson, let me put on the Elmo, a picture
that's previously been marked as 992.

(The instrument herein referred to as a Picture of the blood in the
vial that was drawn from Mr. Simpson's arm by Nurse Thano Peratis on
the 13th of June, 1994 was marked for identification as Defendants'
Exhibit No. 992.)

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) You see that picture, Mr. Matheson?

A. Yes, I do.

Q. Do you recognize that to be a picture of the blood in the vial that
was drawn from Mr. Simpson's arm by Nurse Thano Peratis on the 13th of
June, 1994, correct?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Beyond the scope.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: Yes, I do.

Q. There are records, are there not, within SID, that demonstrate any
time that that blood vial is opened to have blood removed, correct?

A. Well, when each person analyzes it, they record that the vial was
open, yes.

Q. And they actually write their initials on the label and the date,
correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. That's required procedure?

A. To mark the item, yes.

Q. And that's so that you can at any time determine who opened the
vial at any particular time, correct?

A. That's one of the ways, yes, to be able to check the markings that
are on it.

MR. BLASIER: Now, can we zoom in on the stopper.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Can you see the blood on the stopper in that vial?

A. Yes, behind the glass.

Q. Do you have any idea when this particular picture was taken?

A. I don't remember the date. I believe it was one of the times when
representatives of the defense team were in our laboratory, looking at
evidence items.

Q. Do you know whether there are any pictures that exist of that blood
vial prior to June 25 of 1994?

I'm sorry. Let me give you June 14.

A. Not to my knowledge, no.

Q. So you have no way of knowing whether there was blood on the
stopper in that vial as of June 13, do you?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Beyond the scope.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. BLASIER: Let me show you what's been marked as 225.

(The instrument herein referred to as outside of a gray analyzed
evidence envelope was marked for identification as Defendants' Exhibit
No. 225.)

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Can you tell us what that is?

A. That's the outside of a gray analyzed evidence envelope that we
used to book either blood or urine samples in.

Q. And can you see that closely enough to determine whether that's Mr.
Simpson's reference vial envelope?

A. I did see the item number 17, which is the property item number for
Mr. Simpson's blood. I don't know if it mentions from the bottom part
his name or not, but that is the item number that was associated with
that item after it was booked.

Q. Okay.

MR. BLASIER: Why don't you back that off, Phil.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) That number 17 is written in red, correct?

A. Appears to be.

Q. Do you have any idea when that number was put on that envelope?

A. No, I don't.

Q. Okay. Now, what is the correct procedure when blood is collected
with respect to how that envelope is used?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Beyond the scope.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. BLASIER: You can take that off, Phil.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Let me show you again, 2130 serology description
notes.

MR. BLASIER: And I want to zoom in right there.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Can you see that entry, Mr. Matheson?

A. (No verbal response.)

Q. Let me give you a copy of that.

A. I thought I had one.

Okay.

Q. And that entry that we've zoomed in on indicates that on June 13,
approximately one milliliter was removed from Mr. Simpson's reference
vial for swatching, correct.

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Beyond the scope, no foundation.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. BLASIER: It's their business record; they used it to formulate
this chart.

THE COURT: I know. It's beyond the scope of their examination. You may
do it on your portion of your case.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Mr. Matheson, do you have 1302 in front of you?

A. Which one is that one?

Q. That's the document you prepared on the 29th of June.

A. Yes, I do.

MR. BLASIER: Could we have page 2 please.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Now, I believe it was your testimony that the
purpose of examining evidence on the 29th was -- there were actually a
number of different purposes, were there not?

A. Yes, there was.

Q. And one of those was to determine whether there was biological
evidence or biological material on evidence that should be shared with
the defense -- from the defense desires to do testing on their own,
correct?

A. Part of it, yeah. That's the reason for the column that says
"split." Part of it was to determine whether or not we felt there was
sufficient evidence to perform a split of the evidence, or to give the
defense part for their own testing.

Q. And so each item of evidence was examined to determine whether it
had biological material on it, blood stains, et cetera, that might be
split with the defense, correct?

A. No, it wasn't.

Q. When you were examining these items, were you looking at them to
see whether or not they had evidentiary value?

A. Generally, yes. We weren't doing an examination; we were looking at
it and doing an inventory.

Q. You looked at each item, did you not?

A. Yes, we did.

MR. BLASIER: Let's zoom in on number 13.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Now, when you got to number 13 --

By the way, did you fill out this form as you did your examination?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. And when you got to number 13, you were in the room with Mr.
Yamauchi and Michele Kestler, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. You were all looking at the items of evidence, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And number 13, pair of socks, you looked at those items, correct?

A. Yes. I pulled them out of the bag; that's how I determined the
color of them.

Q. Now, let's go over to the far right-hand column. Under comments,
you wrote "blood search," correct?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. And that's because you looked at them to see if there was any blood
on them, didn't you?

A. No. If I had done that -- If I had performed an analysis, it would
have appeared on the column 2 before that, that says "analysis
performed." It doesn't appear in that column.

It does appear in the comments, indicating that is something that we
needed to do.

MR. BLASIER: Well, let's go to the left a little bit, Phil, and go
out, Phil, and go out of it on the "analysis performed" column.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) You have on the "analysis performed" column for
number 12, you have PCR, correct?

A. At the top of the page?

Yes, I do.

Q. You didn't perform that analysis that day, did you?

A. No.

Q. But it had been performed?

Well, number 17, Mr. Simpson's blood again, you indicate RFLP. That
had not been performed, had it?

A. It had not yet been performed, but I believe it had been submitted
out for analysis and that it was in progress.

Q. So the analysis performed was -- that column was for things that
had already been done and some things that were going to be done in
the future, correct?

A. No, I believe it was for the things that had already been done or
things that were in progress.

Q. Now, when you wrote "none obvious," you obviously examined the
socks for blood, didn't you?

A. I brought them out, gave them the color -- Or the color
description, took a general look at them. I did not examine them. It
was just appearance. There was no blood obvious on those socks.

Q. Did Ms. Kestler or Colin Yamauchi say to you, when you made that
notation, that they saw any blood?

A. Not that I recall, no, or I would have indicated that.

Q. And going to page -- or the page that has item number 84 on it,
please. The number is 84 A and B, and C referred to nail clippings
from Nicole Brown Simpson, correct?

A. 84 A and B refer to nail scrapings.

Q. Scrapings?

A. 84 C is the nail clippings.

Q. And you don't have any indication there about any analysis that's
going to be performed, do you?

A. I believe I do. In the comments, I indicate possible PCR
conventional for 84 A, and that carries through to the other items.

Q. That was done, was it not?

A. Yes, it was.

THE COURT: You're not going to be through with this witness for what?

MR. BLASIER: Not for a little while.

THE COURT: Take ten minutes, ladies and gentlemen.

(Recess.)

(Jurors resume their respective seats.) CROSS EXAMINATION (CONTINUED)
BY MR. BLASIER:

Q. Mr. Matheson, did you review records from the lab to determine how
many other times between June 29 when you looked at the socks and
August 4, when Mr. Yamauchi looked at the socks that they were looked
at by other people?

A. I made a quick check, yes.

Q. And how many times were they looked at by other people?

A. It's a quick check I said I did -- I performed. I didn't find that
they had been taken out and looked at during that time at all.

Q. Were you present when Drs. Boden and Lee examined the socks?

A. No, I was not.

Q. Now, on August 4, is it correct, then, that is the first time that
Mr. Yamauchi looked at socks and determined there were blood stains
visible to the naked eye?

A. That was the first date that blood was located, yes. That's
correct.

Q. Now, you indicated that there was a piece of carpeting that was cut
out of the Bronco and was put in a box. Remember that?

A. Yes, I believe it was item No. 33.

Q. And that was a piece of carpeting from the floor board area of the
driver side, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. What else was in that box?

A. That particular box contained most, if not all of the freezer
storage items or -- Yeah, freezer storage items that were collected
initially in the first couple of days of the investigation that were
booked by Mr. Fung.

Q. And that would include the gloves, the knit cap, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. Now, I want to ask you about the stains on the console that -- you
indicated you swatched those stains on September 1, I believe,
correct?

A. Yes.

Q. That's the stains represented on the lower right hand part of this
picture, correct?

A. That's correct. The numbers that are on there are the different
stain locations.

Q. And one of those stains is No. 305?

A. Yes.

Q. Are you aware of any picture at all taken prior to the time this
was taken in the lab that shows blood stain 305?

A. No, I did not.

(Referring to large board entitled "Bronco Evidence.")

Q. Is it accurate to say that the total amount of blood on this
console is actually an extremely small amount of blood?

A. I'm not sure what you mean by extremely small.

Q. Less than a drop is enough to create smears that size, correct?

A. I'm not so sure less than a drop would be enough to do that. I have
not performed any test. That seems small for the amount of blood that
was there.

Q. Have you heard any other estimate that people have given for the
amount of blood on that?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Hearsay, irrelevant.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) You say when you collected those stains, you
swatched them with a swatch, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. Is there a procedure that you have within S.I.D. for collecting
blood swatches?

A. There's an informal procedure, yes.

MR. BLASIER: Could I have a new number, please?

THE CLERK: 2133.

(The instrument herein referred to as instructions included in blood
sample kits was marked for identification as Defendants' Exhibit No.
2113.)

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Let me show you what's been marked as 2133 and
could you tell me what that is?

A. Actually these are a couple of different documents. One of them is
a set of instructions that was prepared for detectives when they
collect blood samples. We supply homicide detectives in particular
with small blood collection or evidence collection kits so that if
they're at a scene that doesn't require a criminalist, other than to
pick up one or two items of blood, they can perform it themselves. The
last of the three pages you gave me were the instructions that are
included with that kit.

The other two I don't have any specific LAPD footer or notation on
that. I believe they have been used during training sessions but I'm
not totally sure.

Q. The last page is instructions that are given to homicide detectives
and all detectives carry or permitted to carry kits that allows them
to make blood swatches at crime scenes, correct?

A. Well, not all of them.

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Irrelevant, beyond the scope.

THE COURT: Excuse me?

MR. LAMBERT: Irrelevant and beyond the scope, Your Honor.

THE COURT: I'll permit that question.

THE WITNESS: Not all the detectives have them or even would be
provided with them. We do provide them to homicide detectives when
they request it.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) And homicide detectives are trained on how to
collect swatches.

MR. LAMBERT: Same objection.

THE COURT: That is sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Mr. Matheson, does scientific investigation
division at LAPD have a field procedures manual that tells people,
criminalists how to collect their evidence?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Beyond the scope, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) When you tried to collect a sample such as on the
console, the proper procedure is to collect as much as possible,
correct?

A. We want to collect as much of the blood as possible, that's
correct.

Q. That's because if you want to do particular kinds of tests such as
RFLP tests, it takes a certain amount of blood?

A. That's correct. It takes a certain amount.

Q. You can't tell from looking at a smear as we see on the console,
whether there's going to be enough there or not to do RFLP tests,
correct?

A. Just from looking at it, or you can have kind of a guess, no,
there's no specific test or anything you can perform.

Q. When your criminalists are there when they see a smear like that,
they're going to be potential DNA tests, do they collect all of it?

A. We ask them to collect as much as possible, up to a quarter size
stain.

Q. When you say a quarter size stain, what do you mean?

A. Well, for -- With a stain that's about the size of a quarter either
when it has been dropped on a sidewalk or on a surface, or you have
about a quarter size stain worth of swatches, you can pretty much
perform all the different types of serological test that's needed to
be performed. We give that as a rule of thumb, if you can collect
about a quarter size stain.

Q. Does it say that anywhere in any document they provided to your
criminalist?

A. No.

Q. Now the stains that you've indicated on the console were actually
discovered on August 26, were they not?

A. I believe two of the stains were previously collected by Mr. Fung.
The one that's in the lower back, right corner of the console, I don't
believe was noticed until that date.

Q. While there were inspections of the Bronco, now, the August 26
date, that was an event, were you present when the Bronco was searched
at this time?

A. No, I was not.

Q. You were aware of that search taking place, were you not?

A. I was aware of it, yes.

Q. That was a search that was done at the direction of Michele
Kestler, the head of the lab, correct?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Foundation.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Prior to August 26 and after stains 31 and 30 were
collected, are you aware of anyone who saw or reported any additional
blood on the console?

A. I don't believe they were -- we were involved in any sort of
searching or searches or anything at that point. I don't recall
anybody else specifically saying something.

Q. Did Dennis Fung, at any time, tell you that he only collected part
of the stains, number 30 and 31?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Hearsay.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Now, you indicated that the procedure you used,
you put a swatch on the stain and then you take the swatch and put it
through a process to allow it to dry, correct?

A. Yes. It's a set on a bindle or on a small piece of plastic under
the conditions that I collected these.

Q. Okay. And, well, describe that procedure to me in a little bit more
detail?

A. The collection process like I did in the laboratory?

Q. Yeah.

A. It's simple. You have a stain on a surface we collect on small
clean cotton swatches or prepared in our laboratory. You pick a
swatch. Say you have a very small stain, you pick a swatch that's
roughly the same size of your stain dampen it in water, shake off the
excess water, apply the stain, rub it around.

The whole idea you're trying to take the blood or whatever it is off
of the surface and take it into the swatch. If you have a larger
stain, then you may use 3, 4, 5, 8, whatever it takes to collect a
representative sample of that quarter or that quarter size sample that
I'm talking about.

Once you feel you have as much as you want to on the swatches, you
take an -- in this particular case, 'cause I was in a laboratory
setting, place the swatches on top of a plastic -- little plastic bag
that I had to allow them to dry; just air dry in the room. After
they're dry, they're taken off of the plastic and put into the bindle
like you've seen before.

Q. And the bindle, all that is a little piece of paper. Like a piece
of scratch paper folded into a square, correct?

A. That's correct. Just a piece of white paper we have around the lab,
three-folded in on itself to capture the evidence inside so it doesn't
get lost.

Q. The proper procedure calls for drying the swatch before it's put in
a paper bindle, correct?

A. It's supposed to be, yes.

Q. And you said that you date and you initial the bindle, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And the purpose for doing that is to be able to track, to make sure
that the bindle that you initialed and dated, if it's looked at later
on down the road, you can tell it's the same bindle that you prepared?

A. That's correct.

Q. If you date and initial a bindle and sometime later you pull what's
supposed to be that same bindle and there are no initials or dates on
it, you know then it's not the same bindle you initially put in there,
correct?

A. I'd be concerned if -- like in these cases, if I dated and
initialed it when I made it and those were gone, yes. I would be
concerned.

Q. Now, it's correct that all of the biological evidence, all of the
blood stains and other pieces of evidence that might have blood on
them were processed through LAPD prior to the time -- S.I.D. prior to
the time they were ever sent to any outside laboratories, correct?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Beyond the scope.

MR. BLASIER: Your Honor, the chart has information about being sent to
other labs on here.

THE COURT: Let me see counsel on that issue.

(The following proceedings were held at the bench:)

THE COURT: This is 216?

MR. LAMBERT: Yes.

THE COURT: I'm on 216. I think there was an objection, wasn't there?

MR. LAMBERT: There was --

THE COURT: Well, I overruled it on the ruling -- apparently I think I
overruled it on erroneous grounds. I think if my recollection serves
me correctly without going back through the computer to find it, I
ruled that it was a business record.

MR. LAMBERT: What it is, Your Honor, it's a summary, voluminous
business records. It's a 12 -- I think its 1209, the summary of
voluminous records exception.

MR. BLASIER: It wasn't prepared by him.

MR. LAMBERT: Doesn't have to be.

This is the same exhibit introduced at the criminal trial.

THE COURT: Doesn't make it any better.

MR. LAMBERT: No. No, I'm saying it's obviously standard, compiled of
underlined records.

THE COURT: There is no 1209.

MR. LAMBERT: I must be wrong. It's the summary of voluminous records.
Exception is --

MR. PETROCELLI: If it's in sequence.

MR. LAMBERT: Maybe it's 14 --

MR. PETROCELLI: It might be in the 14 hundred sequence, Judge.

THE COURT: Is it 1340?

MR. LAMBERT: Its actually called summary or voluminous records.

MR. PETROCELLI: It's 1509, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Okay. The court sets aside its previous ruling that it was
a business record exception. I'll receive it under section 1509 of the
evidence code. Okay.

(The following proceedings were resumed in open court in the presence
of the jury:)

THE COURT: Mr. Blasier, I'm reading the question and frankly I can't
make sense out of the question because the record hasn't been edited
by the reporter sufficiently that I can decipher it.

MR. BLASIER: Let me try it again.

THE COURT: Okay.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Mr. Matheson, on chart number 216, every item on
here that was sent to Cellmark or department of justice or to the FBI
was collected by criminalists working for S.I.D. and was processed
through the S.I.D. division, correct?

A. Well, they were all processed through at some point. In other
words, I packaged and prepared it to be sent out. Some were analyzed,
others were not.

As far as collected, a notable example would be item number 17, Mr.
Simpson's whole blood, we do collect that. That was received and then
booked.

But at some point, all of these other items listed on this chart were
processed through our laboratory. Whether they were analyzed or not --

Q. And indeed, everything you mentioned, are there any things that are
-- went out to other labs that are not on this chart?

A. I didn't go through to check to see if there were additional items
that went out that don't appear here. I was checking the accuracy of
the chart.

Q. Isn't it accurate that everything that went out to other labs was
processed through S.I.D. first?

A. That's correct. If we submitted it to an outside laboratory, we'd
prepare it and process it and present it to them.

Q. Now, the booking process involves -- well tell me what that
involves; whether an item is booked. What does that mean?

A. Basically as it's -- you have an item. You have basically
scientifically prepared it to be forwarded, whether it's a blood item
that needs to be dried and then processed or another item that needs
to be bindled or put on the shelf.

They're prepared -- collected, prepared, packaged, sealed within an
envelope or a box or a larger container of some type. Information is
placed on the outside of the package that reflects the case number,
the case, what is inside of that package. It is then taken to one of
the department's property rooms.

It happens that S.I.D. has a part of our division which is property
facility called our evidence control unit.

So if a criminalist books something, normally it just goes into this
evidence control unit or part of our property division which is
located adjacent to us. If an officer collects something, normally
they book it in or deliver it to a property room that's out at the
location that they work in.

It's then stored at that location, if it's appropriate for it. If not,
it's taken someplace else.

An example being, if a homicide detective collects a blood sample at a
homicide, they'll take it to their local property room where it's
temporarily stored in a freezer until one of our couriers brings it
downtown to the evidence control unit alongside of S.I.D. where we
have a very large freezer to properly store biological evidence.

Q. When an item is booked, it's entered into the LAPD computer system
for tracking, correct?

A. Not when it's booked. Sometime later it is, yes.

Q. Isn't it correct that none of the items in this case were booked
until June 16?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Beyond the scope.

THE COURT: I'll allow it.

THE WITNESS: I believe that would be the first date item No. 1, I
think was actually booked into the system on June 16.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) So the computer system that LAPD has for tracking
items would not show activity on any of the evidence items collected
on the 13th and the 14th until the 16th, correct.

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Beyond the scope.

THE COURT: I'll sustain it. I didn't hear any foundation with regard
to this witness expertise on the computer.

Q. Well, we've gone through this before, have we not, Mr. Matheson,
about the computer system and how it works? You're familiar with that,
aren't you?

A. I have a general knowledge of the department's computer system and
a little bit more; but still, general knowledge regarding the
divisions evidence tracking system.

Q. And you're aware that the computer system allows you at any time
you can make a printout of any particular evidence item and you can
show exactly where it's been from the date it was entered into the
system until today, correct?

A. Not necessarily 'cause there are two different systems. The
property system records, when it's entered in and its general
location, such as evidence control unit, not exactly where it is
within that area. And then when it is logged out by non S.I.D.
personnel, if a police officer checks something out of property or if
it goes over to court, it's recorded in the department system.

Q. And in those two Systems, none of the evidence was tracked or
accounted for in those two Systems until starting on June 16, correct?

A. Assuming the 16th is the proper date, I don't have the property
report in front of me, I believe it is. Our property division would
have had no record of those items until they were physically booked
into it on that date.

MR. BLASIER: We have 1025 on the board with -- can you back out a
little bit.

Mr. Matheson, you testified on direct about EAP tests, correct?

(The instrument herein referred to as Printout of sample blood cells -
EAP vs. DNA was marked for identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No.
1025.)

THE WITNESS: A little bit, yes.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) That stands for a erythro acid phosphotase?

A. Erythrocyte acid phosphotase.

Q. And that is a genetic marker, as you described, other than ABO
typing and some of the others that you mentioned, correct?

A. It is a genetic marker, yes. It's located on the red blood cell.

Q. And --

THE COURT: Excuse me. That's on the TV screen?

MR. BLASIER: I'm sorry, on the screen.

THE COURT: I just want to keep the record straight. Okay. No problem.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Now, it's true, is it not, when you look at the
genetic marker EAP, you're examining something that's in the red blood
cells, correct?

A. I -- probably on the surface of it. But it is associated with the
red blood cell that's correct.

Q. When you do DNA testing, you're not looking at something in the red
blood cells, correct?

A. That's correct. The red blood cells have no DNA in them.

Q. You're looking at two different things. Those are apples an oranges
in the sense that you've done an EAP test and get a particular finding
that has no relationship whatsoever to any DNA profile that might be
in that sample, correct?

A. If it is possible to totally separate the different cells within a
blood sample, that's correct. If you're testing just the red blood
cells like you do an EAP, then it is not correct to the DNA. That's in
the white blood cell.

Q. Now you indicated that you did testing, initial testing to
determine whether you could exclude anybody, correct?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Misstates the evidence, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. Well, the nature of serology analysis is to try and exclude, that's
correct. To --

Q. I'm sorry?

A. To get more and more information, narrow the scope of a sample to
try and exclude all the people that could not have left a sample.

Q. And you performed testing in this case on the finger nail clippings
or scrapings from Nicole Brown Simpson in an effort to try an exclude,
correct?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Beyond the scope.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Now, none of these tests, none of the tests that
you talked about, including the DNA tests are tests that are used to
establish unique identification, correct?

A. That's correct. They're not like fingerprints.

Q. When you say a fingerprint, we're talking about fingerprints from
your fingers that are called dermal fingerprints?

A. I don't know about the dermal, they're fingerprints or your
fingers, that's correct.

Q. That is one forensic technique that does allow you to identify
somebody uniquely, correct?

A. That's correct. And none of the tests in this case, other than --
well, none of serological test or DNA tests conducted in this case
have the ability of establishing uniqueness, correct?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Beyond the scope.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Well, all of the tests that you talked about
require the use of what you said is the product rule, correct; to
establish what it means when you say that one person or one sample
appears to be the same as another sample?

A. Once you start looking at multiple markers, that's correct. You use
the product rule, multiply them together to make the number small and
smaller.

Q. And in order to use that particular rule, there must be what's
called independence between one marker and another marker, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. And a good example of that, if you were trying to figure out how
many people in the population had blond hair and blue eyes, if you
counted up the percentage that had blond hair and multiplied it by the
percentage that had blue eyes, it wouldn't work in that case, would
it?

A. That's correct. I believe there is an association between the --

Q. The reason you can't use that formula is because there's some
connection between blond hair and blue eyes?

A. Like I said, I believe there is, yeah.

Q. So that only works where there is absolutely no connection between
one marker and the other marker?

A. Where they're genetically independent, that's correct.

THE COURT: Okay. Ladies and gentlemen, 10. Don't talk about the case;
don't do form or express any opinions.

(At 12:00 p.m a recess was taken until 1:30 p.m. of the same day.)


SANTA MONICA, CALIFORNIA
MONDAY, NOVEMBER 4, 1996
1:39 P.M.

DEPARTMENT NO. WEQ
HON. HIROSHI FUJISAKI, JUDGE.

(REGINA D. CHAVEZ, OFFICIAL REPORTER)

(Jurors resume their respective seats.)

(The following proceedings were held in open court, in the presence of
the jury.)

THE COURT: (Nods to Mr. Blasier.)

MR. BLASIER: Thank you, Your Honor. GREGORY MATHESON, the witness on
the stand at the time of the luncheon recess, having been previously
duly sworn, was examined and testified further as follows:
CROSS-EXAMINATION (Continued) BY MR. BLASIER:

Q. Mr. Matheson, let me show you a photograph that's previously been
marked as 1420.

(The instrument herein referred to as Photo of the Bronco taken on
August 10 of 1994 was marked for identification as Defendants' Exhibit
No. 1420.)

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Take a look at that, sir, and tell me if that
appears to be a picture of the Bronco taken on August 10 of 1994.

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Foundation.

THE COURT: Excuse me?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. No foundation, Your Honor.

MR. BLASIER: That's what I'm asking him for.

THE COURT: Okay, overruled.

(Witness reviews photo.)

THE WITNESS: There are two photographs on this, the top one showing an
identification photograph that the photographer takes, showing a C
number, which is nothing more than a catalog number within the
department that lists the date, August 10, 1994, the photographer's
location of Virtelli's Towing.

On the bottom part is a photograph of a Bronco looking in from -- I
guess it's a Bronco -- from the right-hand side, with a handwritten
number 15 on the corner, with no other designator.

I never saw the whole vehicle. I don't know if that's that vehicle or
not.

Q. Do you recall testifying this morning about the carpeting that was
removed from the Bronco?

A. Yes, I do.

Q. That was actually removed on the 14th of June, was it not?

A. It's my understanding, yes.

Q. And can you see from this picture that the carpeting in this car
has already been removed over in the area of the driver's side?

A. Yes, it appears to be.

Q. And that's consistent with the appearance of the Bronco with the
carpet having been removed as of June 14, correct?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Calls for a conclusion.

THE COURT: Sustained. This witness said he never saw a photograph of
the complete vehicle at any time.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Now, when you examined the console on September 1,
it was removed from the car, correct?

A. That's correct.

MR. BLASIER: Can we zoom in on the console.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Do you see any evidence of any blood whatsoever on
that console?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. No foundation. Calls for conclusion,
speculation on the part of the witness.

THE COURT: Sustained as to foundation for the photograph.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Are you aware of any photographs of the Bronco
taken between June 14 and September 1 -- Strike that -- August 26,
that shows blood on the console?

A. I don't know of any, but I hadn't seen all the photographs.

Q. Now, could you take a look at 216 that I have in front of you
there.

(Witness reviews Exhibit 216.)

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Now, reference blood samples -- reference blood
sample from a suspect, that's an extremely important piece of
evidence, is it not?

A. All the evidence that is associated with the case can be important.
The reference samples are, yes.

Q. The reference sample from -- that sample that -- everything else
that's found at a crime scene might be compared to that reference
sample, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. If that becomes compromised in some fashion, that can affect the
validity of anything that's compared to it, correct?

A. If there's a problem with a particular reference sample, yes, it's
correct. Then comparisons to that sample would be difficult; it would
be a problem.

Q. On that list there, number 59 and 60, those are also reference
samples, are they not?

A. Yes, they are.

Q. And those are reference samples for Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald
Goldman, correct?

A. That's correct; they're the blood vials.

Q. Those are the EDTA purple-type vials, as we saw with Mr. Simpson's
vial, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. Those are directed at the time of autopsy, are they not?

A. Excuse me. That's my understanding, yes.

Q. And your chart here, or the plaintiffs' chart here, indicates that
the Los Angeles Police Department collected those sample on June 15,
1994?

A. That's correct.

Q. That accurate?

A. It is the date that they were booked into property as those items.

Q. Is says it was collected by LAPD. Was it?

A. Those particular items were prepared by the coroner's office. They
were collected by, I believe, one of the detectives associated with
the case.

Q. And it indicates on there that the blood was sent to Cellmark on
what date?

A. For both of these items, on June 23, 1994.

Q. Between June 15 and June 24 of 1994, where were the victims' blood
samples?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Foundation.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Do you know where it was?

A. Yes.

Q. Where?

A. In the refrigerator located in the serology unit.

Q. We've already discussed that Mr. Simpson's reference vial on this
chart is indicated as number 17, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. Is there any way for blood to get from Mr. Simpson's reference vial
into the reference vials of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman
through any mechanism other than tampering?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Improper, hypothetical, assumes facts not in
evidence.

MR. BLASIER: We'll tie it up.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: I would say for the blood to get from one to another,
somebody would have to open the vials up and pour them together or
something.

MR. BLASIER: That's all I have.

THE COURT: Redirect?

MR. LAMBERT: Thank you, Your Honor.

REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. LAMBERT:

Q. Now, Mr. Matheson, there was some discussion during your
cross-examination about the evidence items being packaged in a box in
the serology department, the various evidence items from this case.

How were those items contained inside the box?

A. Okay. What we were talking about are the items that have the
biological evidence on them that are freezer storage, and they were
kept in one large box for simplicity. But each item inside is packaged
individually or independently.

To give you an example, I've described before the process of doing the
swatches and placed inside a bindle, and the bindle placed inside an
envelope, just a small manila envelope. Then all of those envelopes,
because they were going into a larger box, were placed into another
envelope, not sealed, but just placed there so that they could be
easily found.

And items like clothing items that are a little bit larger, they are
put into closed paper bags. And items such as the carpeting, because
it's kind of large and won't fit into a paper bag, a large piece of
butcher paper is used to enclose it or wrap the evidence inside of it.

Q. So is each item of evidence separately wrapped --

A. Yes.

Q. -- in its own container?

A. Yes.

Q. Also, you were asked some questions about the examination by Colin
Yamauchi on August the 4th of the socks. This was after your June 29
meeting. When you inventoried the items, did you, yourself, after June
29, ever do an examination of the socks?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. And about when was that; do you remember?

A. I believe that was in mid-September.

Q. Okay.

And on that occasion, how did the socks appear to you when you first
looked at them?

A. Well, the socks were still the same. They looked the same as they
did on the 29th.

Q. Did you see blood when you first looked at the socks?

A. It's not apparent, no. It's very difficult to see anything on it.
It just looked like the same material.

Q. And by the time you looked at them, were you aware of the fact that
Mr. Yamauchi had already discovered the existence of in blood on the
socks?

A. Yes, I was.

Q. So you were looking specifically to find blood on this occasion?

A. That's correct.

Q. And were you ever able to actually see it with your eyes?

A. Yes.

Q. And how did you go about doing that?

A. Well, the socks are very, very dark, like I said in my inventory,
I'm not sure whether a navy blue or a black. But they were, in
essence, black.

Blood, when it dries, can also be very dark. In order to do an
examination of something like that, you do it in a laboratory
condition that I did in this case.

You have high intensity lights that can be placed near the surface to
be able to see it. And it seems -- it just takes looking at the
material, like walking into a dark room where you can't see anything,
and allowing your eyes to adjust to it with these socks. If you look
at them and allow your eyes to adjust to the color of the sock, you --
eventually, you start making out the darker areas that had
blood-stained areas.

After a little while, it becomes very easy to pick out the areas that
are actually stained, once you become accustomed to the slight
difference in color.

Q. Other than making that kind of close examination, is the blood
readily apparent on the socks?

MR. BLASIER: Objection. Leading.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: No, it is not.

Q. (BY MR. LAMBERT) Finally, Mr. Blasier asked you some questions
about whether it would be possible for the blood from the reference
samples to be mixed together.

Are you aware of anyone ever mixing together the reference samples in
the case?

A. No, I'm not.

MR. LAMBERT: Thank you, sir.

RECROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. BLASIER:

Q. Mr. Matheson, you were aware at the time you examined the socks on
the 29th, that they were dark, weren't you?

A. Not until I pulled them out of the bag.

Q. Then you were aware of it, weren't you?

A. Yes.

Q. And you were looking at them to see what kind of evidentiary value
they had, right?

A. I was making a quick determination, yes, of what evidence value
there might be.

Q. And criminalists are trained, when they collect evidence, to look
at to see whether it might have evidentiary value, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. Is it your testimony that no one saw any blood on that sock until
August 4?

A. That's correct.

Q. When it was seen on the 4th, it was a very large stain in the ankle
area of one of the socks?

A. On the 4th, I believe at that point there was just a presumptive
test done on the sock, and we didn't know the extent of staining; we
just knew that there was blood present on them. The extent -- even my
testing that I did in September, still didn't show the complete extent
of the blood.

I did find a stain that I sampled.

Q. It was a large stain that was on the ankle area, wasn't it, Mr.
Matheson?

A. That was one of many stains.

Q. It was a large stain, wasn't it?

A. Yes.

MR. BLASIER: That's all I have.

MR. LAMBERT: Nothing further.

THE COURT: You may step down.

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, subject to recall, on our part of the case.

THE COURT: Your part of the case.

THE WITNESS: Thank you.

MR. LAMBERT: We'd like to call now, Dennis Fung, Your Honor. DENNIS
FUNG, called as a witness on behalf of the plaintiffs, was duly sworn
and testified as follows:

THE CLERK: You do solemnly swear that the testimony you may give in
the cause now pending before this court, shall be the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

THE WITNESS: I do.

THE CLERK: And would you please state and spell your name for the
record.

THE WITNESS: My name is Dennis Fung, D-E-N-N-I-S, F-U-N-G.

MR. LAMBERT: Thank you, Your Honor. DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. LAMBERT:

Q. Mr. Fung, what is your occupation?

A. I'm a criminalist.

Q. And by whom are you employed?

A. I am employed by the Los Angeles Police Department, and I am
assigned to the firearms analysis unit of the Scientific Investigation
Division.

Q. Can you explain to us what a criminalist is?

A. A criminalist is somebody who applies the principles of the
physical and natural sciences to identify, collect, and analyze
evidence related to a crime, and then present his findings in a court
of law.

Q. And in order to become a criminalist at the LAPD, are you required
to have some formal educational background?

A. Yes. Bachelor's degree in natural science is required.

Q. And do you have a bachelor's degree?

A. Yes, I do. I have a bachelor of science degree in criminalistics
from the California State University at Long Beach, and I also have a
bachelor of arts degree in chemistry from the California State
University at Long Beach.

Q. When did you receive those degrees?

A. The criminalistics degree was received in 1982, and the chemistry
degree was in 1985.

Q. And when did you join the Scientific Investigation Division?

A. I started there in October of 1984.

Q. And have you worked there continually since that time?

A. Yes, I have.

Q. And you currently are assigned to the firearms -- is it called
division or group or something?

A. I'm with the firearms analysis unit.

Q. Firearms analysis unit.

And what level of criminalist are you with LAPD?

A. I am a criminalist 3.

Q. And can you describe, please, what it takes to become a criminalist
3 with SID?

A. A criminalist 3 requires expertise in three areas of the
laboratory, and at least four and a half years on the job.

Q. And on June 13, 1994, were you a criminalist 3 at that time?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, turning your attention to June 13, 1994, did you receive a
call in connection with a murder investigation that day?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. And about what time did you receive that call?

A. I received a telephone call at approximately 5:30 in the morning.

Q. And who was that from?

A. That was from criminalist Mazzola.

Q. And what did Ms. Mazzola tell you in that call?

A. She informed me that there was a homicide in West LA division.

Q. And what was the reason for calling you?

A. I was assigned as her criminalist 3; she was a criminalist 1; she
is required to have a criminalist 3 out with her at crime scenes.

Q. And she had received the call concerning the crime scene and then
called you; is that what you're saying?

A. Yes.

Q. And what did you do as a result of this phone call from Ms.
Mazzola?

A. I proceeded to meet Ms. Mazzola at the crime lab, and we got in the
crime scene truck and went out to the Rockingham location.

Q. Do you recall about what time you arrived at the Rockingham
location?

A. Referring to my notes, I received -- or I arrived there at
approximately 7:10 in the morning.

Q. Okay. And what did you do when you arrived there?

A. When I arrived there, I was briefed at the scene by Detective
Vannatter.

Q. And how did he go about briefing you?

What did he say?

MR. BLASIER: Objection. Hearsay.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Did Detective Vannatter give you a walk-through of
the crime scene?

A. Yes, he did.

Q. What did he show you?

A. He showed me items of evidence that he was interested in, such as a
red stain on the Bronco door and a blood trail leading -- or a blood
trail that started at the street and went into the front area of the
property. And then there was also a glove on the south side of the
house.

MR. BLASIER: I object and move to strike any testimony about a blood
trail. Without foundation.

THE COURT: Overruled. The Court's going to permit it to show this
witness's state of mind in doing what he did.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Now, Mr. Fung, calling your attention to this
board, which is Exhibit 155, does this board reflect some of the items
of evidence that you collected at Rockingham that day?

A. If I may.

Q. You can step down.

MR. BLASIER: Sorry, Mr. Lambert; what exhibit number was that?

MR. LAMBERT: 155.

MR. BLASIER: Thank you.

Q. (BY MR. LAMBERT) Does this exhibit reflect some of the items of
evidence that you collected that morning at Rockingham?

A. Yes, it does.

Q. And are these the things that were pointed out to you by Detective
Vannatter?

MR. BLASIER: Objection. Leading.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. LAMBERT) Did Detective Vannatter point out these things to
you during the walk-through?

A. Yes.

MR. BLASIER: Same objection.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. LAMBERT) Let me ask you this: What was the next thing you
did after Detective Vannatter gave you the walk-through?

A. The first thing I did was to test a red stain on the door of the
Bronco, on the left side.

Q. Did you -- when you were at the Bronco, was the Bronco open or
locked?

A. It was locked.

Q. Did you look inside the Bronco?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Were you able to observe anything inside the Bronco?

A. I saw what appeared to be red stains on the interior left door and
on the center console.

Q. And this stain that you saw on the door of the Bronco, was that
collected?

A. It was collected the next day, but not --

Q. The one on the door.

A. On the outside of the door it was collected, yes.

Q. Okay.

And after collecting that stain on the side of the door, did you then
proceed to collect some of the other stains that you talked about?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. You can -- you can sit down; you might want to look at your notes.

Do you recall how many of the -- of these blood drops that you
discussed you collected?

A. Yes.

I collected -- or six drops of blood were collected at the Rockingham
location in the morning.

Q. And what are the item numbers that were ultimately assigned to
those blood drops?

A. Those would be items Nos. 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.

Q. And which one is the item that was on the door of the Bronco?

A. Take was item No. 1.

Q. And 4 through 8, where were those items located?

A. Excuse me?

Q. Where were items 4 through 8 located?

A. 4 was located in the street. 5 and 6 were on the south portion of
the driveway. And then 7 and 8 were closer to the entrance of the
house.

Q. Okay. And the first one of those drops that was collected, was that
number 4?

A. Yes.

Q. Could you please describe for the jury the process that you used to
collect that blood drop number 4.

A. After labeling, measuring, and photographing the blood stain, a
substrate control is collected. This is done by using a clean pair of
tweezers to apply a cloth swatch, moistened by distilled water, to an
area close to but not on the stain.

The substrate control is then placed into a plastic bag, and then we
proceed to actually collect the blood stain. Now, between several
cloth swatches, a single thread can be used, depending on the size of
the stain.

MR. BLASIER: I object to the narrative.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: And again, a pair of tweezers that are clean are used to
apply the cloth, which is moistened by distilled water, to the stain
itself.

And the stain is allowed to be absorbed onto the cloth. And once the
cloth or the blood stain is transferred onto that cloth, it is placed
into another plastic bag, and then both plastic bags are placed into a
labeled coined envelope.

Q. (BY MR. LAMBERT) And this is the process that you used to collect
item number 4?

A. Yes.

Q. And did you use that same process to collect all the other items at
Rockingham?

A. Yes.

Q. And you mentioned that sometimes you have to use more than one
swatch. Did that happen at some of these items at Rockingham?

A. Yes.

Q. And you also mentioned the taking of a substrate control. What is
the purpose of doing that?

A. The purpose of the substrate control is to determine if there are
any substances on the area that we're collecting from that will
interfere or somehow affect the outcome of analysis.

And secondary use for the substrate control is to determine if our
technique is proper. If there's a problem with the substrate control,
then the person using -- or doing the analysis, knows there's a
problem someplace in the collection process.

Q. Did you collect the substrate control for all of these blood drops
that you checked at Rockingham?

A. Yes.

Q. You did ultimately collect all of the drops you've listed?

A. Yes.

Q. And after collecting those drops, did you then collect another item
of evidence at Rockingham?

A. Yes.

MR. LAMBERT: Can I get Exhibit 204.

(Clerk hands Exhibit 204 to Counsel.)

Q. (BY MR. LAMBERT) In this item of evidence that you then collected
was the blood that you had heard about --

A. Yes.

Q. -- or seen before?

And let me show you this exhibit here, which is 204 in this case. It
has different numbers on it.

See if you can tell from this if this appears to be the glove that you
collected.

A. Yes, it does.

Q. Okay. Now, when you collected that glove, what did you package it
in?

A. I placed the glove in a paper bag.

Q. And is that the process that you normally use for collecting that
kind of an evidence item?

A. Yes.

Q. And after -- Let me ask you this.

When you collected this glove, where was it? Was it laying on the
ground or was it on some other object?

A. The glove was located at the south side of the house. It's not on
that chart there, but if you were to walk past the driveway and south
of the garage, on the bottom of that chart there, and continue towards
your right (indicating to Exhibit 155), then that was where the glove
was located.

Q. Was it on the ground?

A. Yes, it was.

Q. Did -- could you describe to the jury, the -- well, its appearance
when you saw it just before you collected it.

A. The glove appeared to have red stains on it, and there was a slight
glistening appearance to areas where the glove was -- or where the
blood was.

Q. Is that -- does that glistening appear to you to be blood on the
glove?

A. Yes.

Q. Let me ask you this: Based upon your experience, was that glove wet
or dry at that time?

A. It appeared dry to me.

Q. Now, what time did you finish your collection of evidence at
Rockingham that morning?

A. We finished collecting evidence approximately 10 o'clock that
morning at Rockingham.

Q. Okay. When you finished the evidence collection, is there any step
that you do before you go on to your next task?

A. Before leaving Rockingham, we did an inventory of the evidence that
we had collected to that point.

Q. And you did do that in this case?

A. Yes.

Q. And what did you then do next?

A. After that, we proceeded on to Bundy, the Bundy location.

Q. And approximately what time did you arrive at the Bundy location?

A. We arrived at Bundy at approximately 10:15 in the morning.

Q. And what did you do when you arrived at Bundy?

A. Upon arriving at Bundy, I had a briefing with Detective Lange.

Q. And did Detective Lange give you a walk-through of that crime
scene?

A. Yes, he did.

Q. Detective Lange was in charge of the Bundy crime scene, was he?

A. Yes, he was.

Q. Did Detective Lange point out to you any particular items of
evidence that he wanted collected?

A. Yes, he did.

He showed me keys, a pager, glove, and a cap in the caged area, and
then there was a series of blood drops along the north side of the
Bundy house.

Q. And these blood drops that you described, what condition did they
appear to you to be in?

A. They --

MR. BLASIER: Objection. No foundation.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: The blood drops appeared to be fairly fresh, meaning that
they were red and had a slight tacky appearance to them.

MR. LAMBERT: Let me change charts here a second, Your Honor.

(Counsel displays large board entitled blood drops at Bundy June 13,
1994.)

Q. (BY MR. LAMBERT) And this chart which I put up, which is Exhibit
No. 67 --

MR. BLASIER: 67?

MR. LAMBERT: 67, yes, sir.

Q. (BY MR. LAMBERT) Does this chart represent the location of the
blood drops that you saw that day at Bundy?

A. If I may examine it.

Q. Sure. Here's this pointer if you need it.

A. Yes, it does.

Q. Are these -- in these photographs, there are little cards with
numbers next to them. What are those?

What do those numbers reflect?

A. These numbers 112, 113, 114, 115, and 117, are photo identification
numbers.

Q. And when you got to Bundy that day, which number did you start
with?

A. I started with No. 100 or photo I.D. No. 100.

Q. Why did you start with No. 100?

A. I knew that the detectives were getting a search warrant for the
Rockingham location, so I wanted to have consecutive numbers at that
location; so I started with 100 at Bundy.

Q. Okay. So then you could go back to Rockingham and add other numbers
later?

A. Right.

Q. Now, this one here at the desk was this No. 117?

A. Yes, it was.

Q. And did you walk all the way back to the back of the house and see
that particular blood drop?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. And how did it appear to you?

A. It also appeared to be red, and have a tacky appearance to it.

Q. Okay. All right.

You can take your seat again, if you will.

Now, did you collect these same -- were these same five -- excuse me.

Were these five blood drops collected using the same procedures that
you used at Rockingham?

A. Yes.

Q. Did you -- was there substrate control obtained for these items, as
well?

A. Yes.

Q. You also collected a couple of items that are -- let me start with
number 41.

You know where item 41 was collected?

A. Item 41 was collected from a -- from the dirt area which was by a
tree stump.

Q. And what was the purpose in collecting that item?

A. That item had a red stain which was very near where the male victim
was.

Q. And how about item number 42? What was that item?

A. Item 42 was also a red stain that was collected by the base of the
stairs. And that was where the female victim was.

Q. And these five blood drops up here in this chart, we showed their
photo I.D. numbers. Can you tell us what the actual item numbers are
for those drops that were ultimately assigned?

A. Yes. Photo I.D. No. 112 became 47. Item 47.

Photo I.D. 113 became item 48.

Photo I.D. 114 became item 49.

Photo I.D. 115 became item number 50.

And photo I.D. 117 became item number 52.

Q. Thank you.

In addition to collecting these items of blood evidence, did you also
collect other items of evidence there at Bundy?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Did you collect a glove?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. And a hat?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, when you were doing this collection of the evidence at
Rockingham and Bundy you and Andrea Mazzola divide the
responsibilities between you?

A. We did not divide our responsibilities; we were working as a team.

However, I was in charge of the collection and I made the
discretionary decisions as to what to collect and how to collect them.

Q. Some of the actual, physical steps of doing the collection. Did you
do some and Andrea Mazzola do some?

A. Yes.

Q. And in terms of -- Of taking measurements as to where things were
located, did you do that yourself, or did you do that with Ms.
Mazzola?

A. I did that in conjunction with Ms. Mazzola.

Q. Now, after collecting these items of evidence at Bundy, did you
then do an inventory of the items?

MR. BLASIER: Objection. Leading.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: Yes, we did.

Q. (BY MR. LAMBERT) And having done that, did you assure yourself that
everything you had collected was in your possession?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. And having done that, what did you then do?

A. After performing the inventory, we proceeded back to the Rockingham
location.

Q. And this was now to collect additional evidence from Rockingham?

A. Yes.

MR. LAMBERT: Let me show you one more board.

(Counsel displays board labeled Rockingham Biological Evidence.)

MR. LAMBERT: This board, which is Exhibit number -- what exhibit
number is this?

I'm sorry; I should have had that written down.

Q. Does this board reflect evidence that you collected at Rockingham
on your second trip --

A. Yes.

Q. -- to Rockingham?

A. If I may examine it closer.

Q. Please.

A. Yes, it does.

Q. Could you -- could you tell us what item 12 is, up at the top of
the chart?

A. Item 12 is a -- is two drops of what appear -- what turned out to
be blood.

Q. And what portion of the house was that collected from?

A. That is in the foyer area of the front door.

Q. Okay.

A. The front entrance.

Q. And that was collected on your second trip to Rockingham?

A. Yes, it was.

Q. What is item 13?

A. Item 13 is a pair of socks that were located in the master bedroom.

Q. And was that collected on your second trip to Rockingham?

A. Yes, it was.

Q. And when you collected the socks, how did you package them?

A. Those were placed in a paper bag.

Q. And then item 14, what is item 14?

A. Item 14 is a red stain that was located in from the master
bathroom.

Q. And did you collect that item?

A. Yes.

Q. And were items 12 and 14 collected from the same way as you've
described the other blood evidence?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, while you were -- when you were at Rockingham that day, did
you also receive evidence item 17?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. And what is evidence item 17?

A. Evidence item number 17 is a vial of reference blood from O.J.
Simpson.

Q. And what -- Who delivered item 17 to you?

A. That was delivered to me by Detective Vannatter.

Q. And do you recall approximately at what time he delivered it to
you?

A. Yes. That was delivered to me at 5:20 in the afternoon.

Q. While you were at Rockingham?

A. While I was at Rockingham, yes.

Q. And what did you do with evidence item 17 after you received it
from Detective Vannatter?

A. I put my initials and dated it, and then we brought it to the crime
scene truck.

Q. And after you finished this second time at Rockingham, what did you
then do?

A. We then proceeded to the crime laboratory to process the evidence
and start drawing the blood evidence.

Q. And the crime laboratory is located where, sir?

A. The crime lab is located downtown, on 555 Ramirez Street.

Q. And that's where you took all the evidence that you had collected?

A. Yes.

Q. And was there a particular portion of the crime laboratory that you
took the evidence to?

A. All the evidence was brought into the evidence processing room.

Q. That's a room that's used for the purpose of processing evidence,
obviously.

A. Well, that's where we bring evidence after we've been out at a
crime scene.

Q. Is that room locked?

A. Yes, it is.

Q. And how did you gain access to it?

A. I have a magnetic card that acts as a key.

Q. Those are cards that people at Scientific Investigation Division
have?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, you mentioned that there was some drying of the evidence at
this time; is that right?

A. Yes.

Q. How do you go about drying the evidence?

How do you go about drying the evidence?

A. Well, for the drying process of blood swatches, each item of
evidence is handled individually, meaning one at a time.

First the substrate control is transferred from the bag into a labeled
test tube, and then placed into the -- placed back into the coin
envelope, and then the blood swatch is transferred from its plastic
bag into a labeled test tube, and placed back into the coin envelope.

This is done until all the items of evidence that need to be handled
in this manner are finished, and then they're put in a box and placed
into a drying cabinet.

Q. Now, you mentioned earlier that sometimes when you collect blood
evidence, you use more than one swatch to do it.

A. Yes.

Q. When you have multiple swatches, how do you handle the drying of
multiple swatches?

A. I place the swatches in the test tube, much in the same manner as I
do a single watch.

Q. If you had multiple swatches, they would all go into one test tube?

A. Yes.

Q. Then they're left for the test tube together to dry?

A. Yes.

Q. And those are the procedures that you followed on that afternoon
and evening for the blood evidence you collected at Rockingham and
Bundy?

MR. BLASIER: Objection leading.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. LAMBERT) Were those the procedures that you followed for
all of the items of blood evidence that you had collected at
Rockingham and Bundy?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, sir, on the morning of June 14, did you return to work that
morning?

A. On June 14? Yes.

Q. Where did you go to work that morning?

A. I returned to the crime laboratory.

Q. And was there any further procedure that you did that morning in
regard to the evidence that you'd collected at Rockingham and Bundy?

A. Yes. At that point, I transferred the swatches from test tubes onto
paper bindles.

Q. And after you transferred the swatch from the test tube into the
paper bindle, what do you do with the paper bindle?

A. The paper bindles are labeled and placed back into the coin
envelopes from which they came.

Q. And do you do all of them at once, or do you do one at a time?

How do you process these bindles?

A. Again, each item of evidence is handled one at a time. So you never
have more than one, one item of evidence and its substrate control
allotted more than one at a time.

Q. So you put the evidence item into a bindle; it goes in the coin
envelope. How about the control swatch? What happens to it?

A. The control swatch also goes into its own bindle and then goes into
its own -- or comes into the same item number from which it came.

Q. And did you follow that procedure with all of the blood evidence
that you'd collected at Bundy and Rockingham?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, at -- At the time you were doing this -- strike that.

When you completed this process of putting the swatches into bindles,
did you then do anything else in connection with this investigation?

A. I also went into the serology laboratory.

Q. And what did you do there?

A. I went in there to talk with Mr. Matheson, and Lieutenant Lange was
there also, coincidentally.

Q. And did you also talk with Colin Yamauchi at all?

A. Yes.

MR. BLASIER: Objection. Leading.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: Yes, I did.

Q. (BY MR. LAMBERT) At some point did you -- did you and Matheson and
Yamauchi have a discussion of when what items of evidence you had
checked would be sampled?

A. Yes.

Q. And did Mr. Yamauchi go about doing that sampling?

A. Yes, he did.

Q. Did he do all that after you completed your packaging process that
you just described?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, later that morning, did you do any further collecting of the
evidence?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. And what did you do in that regard?

A. We also had to process the interior portion of the Bronco.

Q. Where was the Bronco located?

A. The Bronco was located across from Parker Center, which is 150
North Center.

Q. And what particular location was the Bronco at?

A. It was in a building we refer to as the print shed.

Q. And when you arrived at the print shed, was it locked or unlocked?

A. It was locked.

Q. And how did you access it?

A. I have a key.

Q. And the Bronco was inside the print shed?

A. Yes, it was.

Q. Was it locked or unlocked?

A. The Bronco was locked.

MR. LAMBERT: This is Exhibit 211, Your Honor.

(Counsel displays Exhibit 211.)

Q. (BY MR. LAMBERT) You said the Bronco was locked. How did you obtain
access to the Bronco?

A. I requested that a detective from burglary auto division come and
slim-jim the door open.

Q. And someone did that for you?

A. Yes.

Q. And you then had access to the Bronco?

A. Yes.

Q. And why don't you step down for a second with your pointer.

Is this exhibit -- does this Exhibit 211, the photographs up at the
top and on the left, reflect the condition of the Bronco as you saw it
on that day?

A. Yes.

Q. And those little cards that you see in the pictures are -- what do
those reflect?

A. Those reflect items of evidence which I collected.

Q. Okay. Let's start with this one right here in the middle, 22 and
23. Would you describe what those are, please.

A. 22 is a blood stain on the interior of the driver door, and 23 is a
blood stain in the well of the handle of the driver door.

Q. 23 is actually inside that little notch we see in the picture?

A. Yes.

Q. Was there also an item 21 that's not in the photograph?

A. Yes. 21, you can see it right at the top of the -- of this picture.
You just don't see the I.D. card, and it's right here.

Q. Okay. And how about item 24? What is that item?

Can you see it from here?

A. 24 is a red stain that was on the dashboard area, next to the light
switch.

(Indicating to card.)

Q. (BY MR. LAMBERT) Item No. 33 up at the top, can you describe for us
what that was, please.

A. Item No. 33 was a red stain that had the appearance of a partial
shoe print.

MR. BLASIER: Objection. Foundation.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. LAMBERT) What did you do with that stain that appeared to
have a shoe print on it?

A. I cut out the entire carpet area of the floor, driver floorboard,
and collected it.

Q. Now, on the console portion of the Bronco, way over here to the
right, you see items 31 and 30?

A. Yes.

Q. Did you collect items 31 and 30, as well?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. What were those?

A. Those were red stains that were very light.

Q. Did you collect all of the stains that were on the console?

A. No; I collected a representative sample of them.

Q. And how did you decide what was a representative sample?

A. I collected one -- well, I collected a swatch that was darkened by
it.

Q. And how did you go about doing that?

A. In the same method that I had described before.

Q. Okay. So you collected one swatch from each of those areas by
getting it dark with blood?

A. Yes.

Q. Were these evidence items that you collected from the Bronco
automobile then taken back and dried in the manner you previously
described?

A. Yes.

Q. Were they later then packaged in the manner you described?

A. Yes.

Q. And the big carpet that was cut out, item No. 33, what did you do
with that piece of evidence?

A. That I placed in a paper bag and booked it to be frozen.

Q. So it was handled a little bit differently than the swatches were
handled?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, let me see the property reports.

I'd like to show you some property reports which are Exhibit 141.

(The instrument herein referred to as Photo of Criminalist Dennis Fung
pointing to the gate at the crime scene was marked for identification
as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 141.)

THE COURT: Before we get into the property report, let's take a
ten-minute recess.

Don't talk about the case; don't form or express any opinion.

(Recess.)

(Jurors resume their respective seats.)

THE COURT: You may resume.

MR. LAMBERT: Thank you, Your Honor.

MR. BLASIER: Did I -- can I see 1412.

MR. LAMBERT: Sure. It's pages 1 through 12.

(Mr. Blasier reviews document.)

Q. (BY MR. LAMBERT) Mr. Fung, let me show you pages 1 through 12 of
Exhibit 1412 and ask you if you could tell us what those are.

A. These are property reports of the items of evidence I collected on
June 13 and 14.

Q. And are those prepared by you, those property reports?

A. Yes, they were.

Q. An do those reflect all the evidence items take you collected at
Bundy Rockingham and in the Bronco on June 13 and 14?

A. Yes.

Q. And in the property report, would you tell me what exhibit -- what
item number 17 is listed as?

A. In the property report, 17 is listed as a as blood, comma, within a
vial labeled O.J. Simpson.

Q. Now would you take a look at this document that we've put up on the
Elmo here?

I don't know if you can see it very well from there.

Do you recognize that document?

A. Yes. That is a document filled out by or made up by Ms. Mazzola.

Q. So the handwriting on there, is that of Andrea Mazzola?

A. Yes, it is.

Q. And I notice she listed on this, the blood vial as being number 18
as opposed to number 17. How did that come about?

A. Ms. Mazzola --

MR. BLASIER: Objection. No foundation.

THE COURT: Foundation.

MR. LAMBERT: By the way, Your Honor, this is exhibit 212. I should
have identified it.

(The instrument herein referred to as lab note referring to Items 17,
18, 19 was marked for identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 212.)

Q. (BY MR. LAMBERT) Did Ms. Mazzola -- was Ms. Mazzola aware of the
fact that you received the blood vial from Detective Vannatter at
Rockingham at 5:20 on June 13?

MR. BLASIER: Objection. Calls for speculation.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: No, she was not.

Q. (BY MR. LAMBERT) Did you, the next day, later, tell Ms. Mazzola
that you had gotten the blood vial the day before and that it was to
be listed as item number 17?

MR. BLASIER: Objection. Hearsay and leading.

THE COURT: Sustain as to leading.

Q. (BY MR. LAMBERT) Did you have -- did you have a conversation the
next day with Mazzola in which you discussed with her the fact that
you -- that you had received the blood vial the prior day?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Now, and did you tell her what the evidence item was for that blood
vial?

A. I told her that it would be 17 instead of 18.

Q. And did this piece of paper that we see here, was this part of an
official report or just notes of Ms. Mazzola?

A. That was notes.

Q. In your official report, how is the blood vial listed?

A. No. The property report, the blood vial was listed as item number
17.

Q. Thank you.

Now, we've already talked about your doing a search of Mr. Simpson's
Bronco automobile.

You can take that down.

Did you ever do a search of Mr. Simpson's Bentley automobile?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. When was that search done?

A. That was done on June 30.

Q. And where was that done?

A. That was also done in the print shed.

Q. And what were you looking for specifically in that search?

A. In that search, I was looking for blood within the interior of the
Bentley and a knife.

Q. And did you find any knife in the Bentley?

A. I found a small pocket knife, but that didn't fit the criterion for
what we were looking for.

Q. Did you find any blood inside the Bentley?

A. No. We could not detect the presence of blood within that vehicle.

Q. Is there a test that you use for the purposes of determining
whether blood is presumptively present or not?

A. Yes. The presumptive tests using the reagent phenolphthalein and
hydrogen peroxide was used.

Q. And that test can tell whether a stain is presumptively blood or
not blood?

A. It detects the presence of blood.

Q. Did you use that test on the interior of the Bronco?

A. Bronco or Bentley?

Q. I'm sorry, thank you. The interior of the Bentley?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. In how many places in the interior of the Bentley did you check; do
you recall?

A. There were numerous areas checked. Anytime I saw what appeared to
be an anomaly in the interior -- it was a black interior so it was
pretty hard to detect blood -- Anytime I saw an anomaly, I went ahead
and swabbed it to see if it was positive or not.

Q. Anything that you thought could possibly be blood, you tested it?

A. Yes.

Q. Did you find any blood at all?

A. No.

Q. Did there come a time after June 14 when you returned to the Bundy
location to collect any further blood evidence?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. And when was that?

A. That was on July 3, 1994.

Q. Who asked to go to Bundy on that occasion?

A. Detectives Lange and Vannatter requested that I come back to the
Bundy scene.

Q. And when you arrived, who was there?

A. When I arrived, Detectives Lange and Vannatter were there.

Q. And what did they ask you to collect on that occasion?

A. There was a -- there was this blood on the back gate of Bundy and
they pointed it out to me.

Q. And did you collect it?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Did that blood get item numbers?

A. Yes. Those items -- those items became numbers 115, 116, and 117.

Q. And was that blood collected in the manner that you previously
described?

A. Yes.

Q. And those blood drops on that back gate, did you see them when you
were collecting evidence on June 13 at Bundy?

A. No, I did not.

Q. Do you remember examining the back gate to look for evidence at
all?

A. Not specifically, no.

MR. LAMBERT: I'd like at this time, Your Honor, to move in some
exhibits, items 204, 211, 1412 and 208.

208 is partially already stipulated to, Your Honor.

MR. BLASIER: Can I see what they are?

MR. LAMBERT: One of them is the glove.

1412 is the thing you just looked at.

211 is the board -- the Bronco board.

MR. BLASIER: Okay.

THE COURT: Okay. They're received.

(The instrument herein referred to as a box and contents Nos. 9, 10,
18 and 27 was marked for identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No.
204.)

(The instrument herein referred to as a box and contents Nos. 9, 10,

MR. LAMBERT: I have no further questions, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Cross-examine.

MR. BLASIER: Thank you, Your Honor.

CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. BLASIER:

Q. Good afternoon, Mr. Fung.

A. Good afternoon.

Q. How are you today?

A. Good.

Q. Mr. Fung, have you spent any time preparing for your testimony in
this case?

A. Yes.

Q. And since Mr. Simpson was acquitted in October of 1995, how much
time would you say that you've spent on the Simpson case total; just
an approximation?

A. About 48 hours.

Q. And of that 48 hours, how much of that time was spent at the behest
of the plaintiffs' attorneys in the civil case?

A. Probably about 40.

Q. And of the 40 hours that you spent with the plaintiffs, can you --
can you break that down for me and tell me approximately how many
times you've met with plaintiffs' attorneys or representatives of
plaintiffs?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Misstates the evidence, "spent with the
plaintiff," Your Honor.

MR. BLASIER: I thought I said plaintiffs' attorneys and plaintiffs'
representatives.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: I've spent about six -- six hours with the plaintiffs'
attorneys.

Q. And of the other 34 hours, what was that devoted to?

A. Reading all that testimony, going through the transcripts.

Q. That was reading the nine days of your direct and cross-examination
from the criminal trial?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, did you do that on city time?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Irrelevant.

MR. BLASIER: Goes to bias.

THE COURT: Excuse me?

MR. BLASIER: Goes to bias.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: I'm not sure how it's being worked out.

Yes, it was on city time.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) So you got approval, or someone apparently got
approval to have you spend approximately 40 hours, on city time,
working for the plaintiffs in this case, correct?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Argumentative, "working for."

THE COURT: Overruled. I'm not sure exactly how or what's been worked
out, but I was doing it on city time.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Are you keeping track of your billing so that you
can bill the plaintiffs?

A. They told me to keep track of the hours that I worked on it, yes.

Q. Have you ever worked for plaintiffs on a civil case before other
than the Simpson case?

A. Not to my recollection.

Q. Now, as of June 13, when you started working on this case, had you
received any formal training at all on quantities of blood that are
necessary to be collected for DNA testing?

A. Yes.

Q. And what sort of training had you received?

A. We received -- I received a brief lecture on the amount needed for
RFLP testing.

Q. One brief lecture?

A. Yes.

Q. And what were you told was the amount needed for RFLP testing?

A. At this time, I was told they needed a quarter to a -- I think it
was a dime-sized drop of blood to be collected.

Q. By the way, do you have a procedures manual within S.I.D. that
tells you how you're supposed to collect evidence?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Beyond the scope, irrelevant.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: I'm aware that one had been drafted but it is not an
official document.

MR. BLASIER:

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Is that true since you started working for S.I.D.
from 1986 or '84, excuse me?

A. Is what true?

Q. That there has been no procedures manual within S.I.D. that tell
criminalists how to collect evidence?

A. There's no manual written, no.

Q. And as of your testimony in the criminal case, there was a manual
in draft form, correct?

A. During the criminal trial, yes.

Q. And there's still a manual; it is only in draft form, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And you've never seen it?

A. I've seen it now, but I haven't read everything.

Q. When you were preparing for your testimony in the criminal case,
did deputy District Attorney Hank Goldberg have to tell you what DNA
was?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Irrelevant.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. BLASIER: Did you know what DNA was at the time you testified in
the criminal case?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Irrelevant, argumentative.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Mr. Fung, what is the procedure that is used to
call a criminalist to a crime scene?

Would you describe that in general to me?

A. I can in general. What usually happens --

Q. Um-hum?

A. -- a detective will request that -- well, they'll call you up,
detective headquarters division, and tell them that he needs a
criminalist. They will go ahead and make notifications.

Q. And how, when that's done, generally isn't that done a soon as a
crime scene is discovered?

A. I can't really speak from that end of the -- from that position
cause I haven't been at the beginning of a crime scene.

Q. Were there any criminalists called to the Bundy crime scene between
12 o'clock at night on the 13th and 10 o'clock in the morning, to your
knowledge?

A. No.

Q. Is it standard practice for there to be a ten-hour delay between
the time a crime scene is discovered and when a criminalist is called?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Irrelevant, beyond the scope.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. BLASIER: Isn't it important to you that you be called to a scene
as soon as possible?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Irrelevant. Beyond the scope.

THE COURT: Overruled. It depends on the scene.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Evidence can change at a crime scene, can it not?

A. Yes, it can.

Q. Biological evidence can change substantially, can't it?

A. Depending on the conditions, yes, it can.

Q. Hair and trace evidence can get moved all around, can't it?

A. Again, depending on the conditions. It would depend.

Q. There are changes that can occur to bodies, as well, in that period
of ten hours, are there not?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Irrelevant, beyond the scope.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Are you aware of any instance in any other case,
other than this one where it took ten hours to have a criminalist
called to a crime scene?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Irrelevant.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. And as of June 13 of 1994, how long had Andrea Mazzola been a
criminalist?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Irrelevant.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. BLASIER: Your Honor, there's testimony about her working on this
case.

THE COURT: Excuse me?

MR. BLASIER: There was testimony about her working on this case.

THE COURT: Why don't you ask her.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Do you have that information, Mr. Fung?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection, Your Honor. Irrelevant.

THE COURT: Well, I think it is irrelevant. This is the wrong person to
ask.

MR. BLASIER: He's the witness that's here, Your Honor.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) You were supervising, were you not?

A. Yes, I was.

Q. She was a beginner, wasn't she.

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Argumentative.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: She was a criminalist 1.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) It was only her third crime scene wasn't it?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Foundation.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Are you aware of how many crime scenes she worked
at prior to this one?

A. I'm not exactly sure of the number I knew -- I know it is less than
ten.

Q. It is two, isn't it?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Foundation, argumentative?

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Andrea Mazzola was placed in charge of the crime
scene at Bundy and Rockingham wasn't she?

A. She was initially listed as the officer in charge. However, when I
found out the scope of the crime, I assumed the officer in charge
position.

Q. At what time was that?

A. I don't know the exact time. It was somewhat into the crime scene
at Rockingham.

Q. Before you went to Bundy?

A. Yes.

Q. And when you say the scope of the case, what did you mean by that?

A. That it was a high profile case.

Q. High profile meaning what?

A. There was a celebrity involved.

Q. Was there any other reason why she was not kept in charge?

A. Not that can think of, no.

Q. Let me show you what's been previously marked as exhibit 202.

Do you recognize this document, Mr. Fung?

(The instrument herein referred to as crime scene checklist was marked
for identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 202.)

A. Yes, I do.

Q. What is that document?

A. That is a crime scene checklist?

Q. And tell us how that document gets generated?

A. Well, when a call gets made to a criminalist, they start filling it
out and we fill out the blanks as we go along as we see the
information become appropriate.

Q. Now Mr. Fung, isn't it correct that on that form, Andrea Mazzola is
listed as the officer in charge?

A. That's correct.

Q. And she was actually the first one called to the scene, wasn't she?

A. The detective headquarters division did notify her.

Q. And were you dispatched to the Bundy scene first or the Rockingham
scene?

A. We were requested to respond to the Rockingham scene first.

Q. You were never told to go to Bundy and then that order was changed
to go to Rockingham instead, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. Now, is it -- is it standard procedure at a crime scene to -- well,
let me withdraw and ask it this way.

What is crime scene tape used for?

A. Crime scene tape is used to delineate or used to delineate the
perimeters of a crime scene.

Q. All right. And is one of the main reasons for that is to keep
people away from potential evidence?

A. That and it also helps the officers know what the parimeters of the
crime scene are.

Q. And during your several visits to the Rockingham crime scene, both
in the morning and in the afternoon, was there ever any crime scene
tape put around the Bronco?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Irrelevant, beyond the scope.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: Not to my knowledge.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Mr. Fung, can you See that board okay?

A. Yes.

Q. And that is -- what number is that?

A. 155.

Q. Now you arrived at the Rockingham scene at about what time?

A. I arrived at Rockingham at 7:10 in the morning.

Q. By the way, when did you first become aware that there was a
celebrity involved in this case?

A. During the walk through, Detective Vannatter told me this was the
residence of O.J. Simpson.

THE COURT: What are you doing?

MR. P. BAKER: Booking that. I didn't want to drip. (Laughter.)

MR. BLASIER: You indicated that that morning when you got there, that
Detective Vannatter pointed out a blood stain on the Bronco?

A. I believe so.

Q. Didn't Detective Fuhrman point that out to you?

A. I believe it was Detective Vannatter.

Q. Detective Fuhrman was there, was he not?

A. Yes, he was.

Q. Did Detective Fuhrman ever point out any stains on the Bronco to
you that morning?

A. I don't recall him pointing anything out. I do recall that he was
there. But to the best of my recollection, it was Detective Vannatter
that pointed out the glove.

Q. Now, you observed the blood spot near the door, correct?

A. The door of the --

Q. Of the Bronco?

A. -- Bronco. It was on the handle of the Bronco, yes.

Q. Did you collect that?

A. I was present during the collection and participated in phases of
it, yes.

Q. You testified on direct that you collected that. Did you prepare
the Swatch on that?

A. The actual manipulation of the tweezers was done by Ms. Mazzola.
However, collection involves identification, measuring and
documentation. So I was -- I did collect the stain and we were working
as a team also.

Q. We have a picture also on the television.

MR. BLASIER: Which is that, Phil?

MR. P. BAKER: 108.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Is that a picture of you pointing out a spot on
the door of the Bronco?

A. Wrote it is.

Q. Were there any pictures of Andrea Mazzola pointing out a spot, that
spot or doing any work on it?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Irrelevant.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Now, you testified about how blood drops -- I
think you described it as a trail going from the Bronco to the
residence, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. You have no way of knowing what direction -- if it is indeed a
trail -- that it is going, whether it is going from the residence to
the Bronco or the other way around, do you?

A. Well, there is one spot that does have directionality to it.

Q. What spot is that?

A. That is item number 7 and that's the far right bottom picture. You
can see some trailing there.

Q. Any other item have any directionality to it?

A. I wouldn't call any directionality to any of the others.

Q. You have no way of knowing whether the other drops -- whether the
other drops got there vis-a-vis drop number 7 or any of the other
drops, do you?

A. I can tell that they were all fresh drops and -- but as far as
minute -- a minute-to-minute thing, no.

Q. When you say fresh drops, you're saying that because of what?

A. Their appearance.

Q. And their appearance is what? What tells you that they're fresh?

A. They were red and slightly tacky.

Q. Okay. Why don't you step down here for a second look at the picture
on the bottom right, which has the card number C on it.

What is that -- does that picture represent?

A. That represents another drop of -- well, it is a red stain that was
tested presumptively above positive with phenolphthalein.

Q. And is that the only apparent blood in that picture?

A. Well, yeah.

Q. Okay. This item up here to the left of the C, that's not blood; is
it?

A. I don't recall if it is or not.

Q. If you had seen blood, what you thought was blood right next to C,
you would have marked that, would you not?

A. If it was in that very close proximity, I may or may not, depending
on the type of scene it was. At that scene, I could very well have
marked both those stains C.

Q. Did you ever make any notation, in any document whatsoever that C
stands for two stains rather than one stain?

A. No, I did not.

Q. You would never make an assessment it was blood just based on
looking at a picture, would you?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Irrelevant, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled. What's that board?

MR. PETROCELLI: 155.

THE COURT: Okay. Thank you.

THE WITNESS: I wouldn't. I would rather have it tested.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Now, Mr. Fung, the red dots on the chart up here,
are those the approximate locations of the drops that you identified?

A. The most approximate drops, yes.

Q. Did you find any drops of a parent blood between this one, which is
-- you do know which number this one is, 6?

A. Let me check my notes.

Q. 6N.

(Indicating to diagram 155.)

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) And the garage area on the south side of the
house?

A. There was a stain that we found positive for with phenolphythalein
on a prior on the south side of the house.

Q. Well, I'm talking about on the ground back here.

A. No, not on the ground.

Q. You would never testify that something was blood just based on a
phenolphthalein test, would you?

A. I would say that it was presumptively positive.

Q. Tell me all -- I'm sorry. Were you done?

A. Yes, I am.

Q. Tell me all the things that give a presumptive positive reading
that aren't blood with a phenolphthalein test?

A. There are items that have vegetable peroxidase in them that are
reported in the literature to give positive, false positives. And
there are certain chemicals known as oxidizers that will give false
positives to other types of presumptive tests.

Q. There are oxidizing agents that also give a false positive,
correct?

A. Are we speaking in terms of the two-step phenolphthalein
hydroperoxidase?

Q. I'm talking about the phenolphthalein test, correct?

A. I believe that in the two-step phenolphthalein test only vegetable
peroxidase give a false positive with addition of hydrogen peroxide.
The chemical oxidizers will turn the phenolphthalein pink before the
addition of hydrogen peroxide.

Q. What Sort of vegetable materials are you talking about that will
give a false positive?

A. Vegetable peroxidase, that's an enzyme I believe contained within
vegetable or plant material. Some of them include apple, beet root . .
.

Q. Apricots, black berries, artichokes, potatoes, turnips, cabbage;
all of those can give you positive phenolphthalein tests, can't they?

A. They -- I'm not sure about all of them, but many of those on the
list do sound familiar.

Q. None of those are blood, are they?

A. None of them have the initial appearance of blood.

Q. When you --

A. However --

Q. When you do a positive, when you do a test, you collect a blood
stain before, to run confirmatory testing after you've done a
phenolphthalein test, correct?

A. I'm sorry. Can you repeat that?

Q. Yeah. You don't make an assessment that something is blood just
based on a presumptive test alone, do you?

A. I don't know. I mean, no, I don't.

Q. And what you do is, you collect it and you take it back to the lab
and you do what's called confirmatory testing. And if it is blood, you
can determine that back there, correct?

A. Well, it is done by somebody else but, yes.

Q. Okay. You never collected -- well, let me strike that.

Now, Mr. Fung, this is an overview of Rockingham that contains more
information than the one we looked at?

A. Yes.

Q. This is number --

MR. P. BAKER: I believe it is 145.

MR. BLASIER: 145.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Can you tell me the distance from the air
conditioner indicated here opposite Mr. Kaelin's room and the gate
along Rockingham?

A. From the air conditioner to the gate?

Q. Yes.

A. I can give you an approximate distance.

Q. Okay.

(Witness reviews documents in notebook.)

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Let me show you something that might help: Exhibit
905. Well, you're looking at the same thing.

A. Yeah. But it doesn't have the air conditioner on it.

Q. Well, would you agree that it appears to be approximately 250 feet
from the gate to the air conditioner?

A. Somewhere between 250 and 220.

Q. Okay. By the way, isn't one of your jobs to measure distances such
as that?

A. It is my job to measure distances relative to the evidence I
collect.

Q. Okay. And did you take any measurement from the area where the
glove was found?

A. I measured the distance from the west wall of the garage to the
glove.

Q. Okay. Why don't you tell us what that distance is?

A. The distance was measured as 118 feet east of the west wall of the
garage.

Q. So that would be indicated in this corner, where my pen is?

A. Yes.

Q. The lower left corner of the garage as it appears on the diagram?

A. It would be from this point here.

Q. Okay. 119 feet you say?

A. 118.

Q. 118 feet.

Now, did you find a single blood drop or single drop that was
collected and determined to be blood anywhere along this pathway?

A. On the ground?

Q. Correct.

A. No.

Q. Did you find any drop along here anywhere that was tested and
confirmed to be blood?

A. No.

Q. Did you find any tissue samples on the air conditioner?

A. No.

Q. Did you find any shoe prints or shoe imprints in blood along this
entire 119 feet?

A. I could not detect any.

Q. Did you find any shoe impressions that appear to be in blood
anywhere outside of Rockingham in the driveway area?

A. No.

Q. Did you find any evidence whatsoever indicating that anyone climbed
over the fence from the air conditioner to the front gate?

A. No.

Q. When you found that glove back there, it didn't have any dirt on it
at all, did it?

A. I did not examine the glove that closely.

Q. Well, when you collect evidence, you try to preserve evidence that
might be attached to a piece of evidence like a glove, don't you?

A. Yes.

Q. And did you observe any dirt on that glove?

A. I didn't observe any and I didn't look for any.

Q. There weren't any cobwebs on it either, were there?

A. No cobwebs.

Q. No evidence of any kind of insect activity, was there?

A. I don't remember any.

Q. There was no evidence of any hair and fiber that you collected
anywhere from the gate area back to the air conditioner; is that
correct?

A. There -- Well, excluding the glove?

Q. Excluding the glove.

A. I did not find any or I did not collect any hair and fiber evidence
from that -- that area that was described by you.

Q. By the way, animal blood gives you a positive phenolphthalein,
doesn't it?

A. Yes, it does.

Q. Such as from a dog? If you tested it from a dog, you'd get a
positive phenolphthalein test?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, it is accurate, is it not, that there is a door that goes into
the house at Rockingham along the side of this garage, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And is it also accurate that there is a second door into the
residence and the area I'm indicating, just behind the garage that
goes into a laundry room area, correct?

A. I don't recall that door. I don't dispute it, but I don't recall if
there is or not.

Q. There isn't a single door into the Rockingham house from the air
conditioner to the right, is there?

A. No, there is not.

Q. By the way, there is also a -- it is not depicted in that diagram,
but there is a rather large tree on the corner of the garage right
where I'm pointing, is there not? Do you remember that?

A. I don't remember that.

Q. Do you remember a second large tree just past the first one?

A. I know there were trees, but I don't know the exact position. I
don't remember the exact positions.

Q. It was a relatively tight squeeze to get around this corner, is it
not? You have to duck, must be short like me to get under those trees,
right?

A. I remember it was tight in some positions.

Q. Now, is it considered to be a good technique to conduct
phenolphthalein testing on items in the field that can be collected
and taken back to the lab?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Irrelevant, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) You did a phenolphthalein test on that group while
you were at the scene?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Doing a phenolphthalein test actually dries some of the potential
evidence, does is it not?

A. Not if it is done in a careful manner.

Q. Well, the spot on the Bronco door, that was ruined for any further
testing because of the phenolphthalein test, was it not?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Argumentative, assumes facts not in evidence.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: I don't believe it was ruined. It started out at as a
very light spot and we collected what was there.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Do you know whether anyone was ever able to type
that at all beyond your phenolphthalein test?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. No foundation.

MR. BLASIER: Do you know?

THE COURT: Overruled.

You may answer.

THE WITNESS: I am not aware of any further testing done on item No. 1.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Now, is it an acceptable procedure in your mind to
do a phenolphthalein test on a piece of evidence like the glove that
is going to be collected and taken back to the lab at the scene.

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Irrelevant.

THE COURT: As posed, sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Detective Vannatter told you to do that test,
didn't he?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection.

THE WITNESS: He asked that I perform that test, yes.

Q. You didn't want to do that test, did you?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Argumentative.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: It was important to him at that point in the
investigation, so I did perform that test for him.

MR. BLASIER: Move to strike as nonresponsive.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) You didn't want to do that test, did you?

A. I had -- I had no problem doing that test.

Q. You knew it was bad technique to do that test, didn't you?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Irrelevant.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) You refused to do a phenolphthalein test on the
knit cap at Bundy for that same reason.

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Argumentative and irrelevant.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Did you do a phenolphthalein test on the knit cap
at Bundy itself?

A. I was never asked to.

Q. You were never asked to?

When you manipulate evidence at a crime scene, you can lose trace
evidence, can you not?

A. It is possible to.

Q. And you try to leave items of physical evidence that you're going
to collect undisturbed, if possible so that you don't disturb trace
evidence, correct?

A. When -- when? Yes. That is the preferable method.

Q. And anytime you do something like a phenolphthalein test on a piece
of evidence, you have to manipulate it, don't you?

A. If it is done carefully, I don't, sometimes; or if it is done
carefully, the damage to the evidence will be minimal.

Q. When you manipulate evidence at a crime scene valuable trace
evidence can be lost; isn't that correct.

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Irrelevant.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: It is possible for it to be lost. However, if it is done
carefully, evidence isn't lost.

Q. Anytime you touch a piece of physical evidence at the scene, you
can also transfer evidence from the piece of evidence for your hand or
your glove, can't you?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Irrelevant, assumes facts not in evidence,
calls for speculation.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Were you wearing gloves when you collected the
glove?

A. I don't recall if I was or not.

Q. By the way, which part of the glove did you handle to do the
phenolphthalein test?

A. There was a -- I didn't actually handle the glove. I would have
used a cotton applicator to touch the glove with the -- With a wet
cotton swab and then tested the cotton swab.

Q. In what area of the glove do you remember?

A. Whatever was facing up and had the red stain on it.

Q. Do you know whether you were wearing gloves at time that the drops
on the driveway were collected?

A. I know Ms. Mazzola was.

Q. Now, you didn't collect any of those drops, did you?

A. As I had described before, the collection process involves many
steps, and I was involved in the collection of those blood stains.

Q. Do you remember, you testified at a grand jury here in this case,
did you not?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. And that was right after -- it was before the preliminary hearing,
was it not?

A. Yes.

Q. It was very close in time to when you processed the crime scene,
was it not?

A. Yes.

Q. It was in -- I believe early July, correct, of '94?

A. Somewhere in there, yes.

Q. Do you remember being asked questions regarding the spot on the
Bronco door?

A. Yes.

Q. And do you remember testifying at the grand jury hearing that you
recovered them in the manner described and that is the procedure you
described to us?

A. I did say that I collected them because Ms. Mazzola and I were
working as a team.

Q. But you said that you did that work, correct?

A. In my mind, when we were working as a team, I did it. I was in
charge of her. I was in charge of her and she acted under my
direction.

Q. She collected all the Bundy drops, didn't she?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Irrelevant, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: She collected most of the Bundy drops. However, I did
collect some of them myself.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Do you remember being asked this question at the
grand jury hearing.

"Q. Did you attempt to retrieve and preserve the blood found in those
blood drops referring to Bundy?

"A. Yes, I did.

"Q. What did you do?

"A. I transfered the blood drops onto cloth squares or cloth
swatches."

Do You remember testifying that way, Mr.'Fung?

A. Yes.

Q. That wasn't true, was it?

A. I was answering the questions from a position of what was done and
not of a position of who did what.

Q. You were asked what did you do, Mr. Fung, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. You said, "I transferred the blood onto cloth squares," didn't you?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. That wasn't true, was it?

A. Because we were working as a team and she was working under my
direction, I don't see that as being a lie.

Q. You never mentioned Andrea Mazzola once during the grand jury
proceedings, did you?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Irrelevant. Beyond the scope.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) You were attempting to minimize Angela Mazzola's
involvement in the processing of this crime scene because she was so
inexperienced; isn't that correct?

MR. LAMBERT: Same objection and argumentative.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. BAKER: Which ground, Your Honor?

THE COURT: Both.

MR. BLASIER: Mr. Fung, do you remember testifying that when you're
involved in the mental aspect of the crime scene investigation, then
you use the word "I" to describe what somebody else might have done?

MR. LAMBERT: Same objections, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

MR. LAMBERT: Could I get the page and line evidence reference?

MR. BLASIER: 22937, line 1.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Do you remember that testimony?

A. Can you repeat that?

Q. Let me read the question. (Reading:)

"Q. If you were to divide the work up of a criminalist into the mental
component of deciding what to collect, what not to collect in the
discretionary type decisions and then a physical component of actually
collecting which component were you involved in do you believe
primarily.

"A. Primarily I was involved with the mental aspect of the crime scene
investigation."

Remember that testimony?

A. Vaguely.

Q. And that's your basis for using the term "I" when you're asked when
you did something or not; is that correct?

A. That's one of the bases, yeah.

Q. By the way, when we talk about hair and fiber evidence, tell us
what that is.

A. Hair and fiber evidence is, or it can be hair that is left at a
crime scene or fibers that are left at a crime scene.

Q. Fiber from something like a carpet or a piece of clothing or any --
Any item that is made out of cloth, for instance, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. Or synthetic material?

A. Yes.

Q. And isn't it true, Mr. Fung, that where you have a scene like the
Bundy scene, where Mr. Simpson was a frequent visitor, the presence of
hair and fiber that might be consistent with him is not unusual; isn't
that correct?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Assumes facts not in evidence, calls for
speculation.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Let me ask you hypothetically, Mr. Fung; isn't it
true that where you have a crime scene that is frequented by a
particular person, it is not unusual to find hair or fiber that's
consistent with that person at that crime scene, correct.

MR. LAMBERT: Outside the scope, assumes facts not in evidence,
speculation.

THE COURT: Sustained. You may call him as your own witness when your
turn comes.

MR. BLASIER: We'll do that, Your Honor

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Who was in charge of the crime scene at Bundy?

A. The officer in charge.

Q. Who was in charge of processing the crime scene?

THE COURT: Sustain my own objection as being vague.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) What was your function at Bundy?

A. I was in charge of collecting evidence.

Q. Okay. Are you the one that was in charge of deciding what evidence
should be collected?

A. Yes, ultimately.

Q. And you were in charge of deciding where evidence was located,
correct?

A. Yes.

Q. You were in charge of conducting searches of the area to find all
relevant evidence, correct?

A. My search was directed towards the cage area and the walkway north
of the residence.

Q. I move to strike as nonresponsive, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Tell us what your responsibility was again?

A. My search was directed towards the caged area of the Bundy location
and the walkway north of it, extending into the driveway area.

Q. Okay.

MR. BLASIER: We're going to have a board put up here in a second.

THE COURT: Okay. Let's take a ten minute recess, ladies and gentlemen.
Don't talk about the case; don't form or express any opinions.

(Recess.)

(Jurors resume their respective seats.)

(The following proceedings were held in open court, in the presence of
the jury.)

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Thank you, Mr. Fung.

I have one question on the area at Rockingham. Isn't it true that from
the area of the diagram, there's a -- there's a point in the
Rockingham house where the walkway becomes very, very narrow?

A. Yes.

Q. And, in fact, you can see it fairly well in the bottom left --
actually, the bottom left picture, can you not?

A. Yes.

Q. It's extremely narrow in there, is it not?

A. It's narrow.

Q. And did you measure the distance from the corner here, where it
gets real narrow, back to the air conditioner?

A. I don't remember taking measurements of the air conditioner itself.

Q. How about where the glove was found, as compared to the corner
where it's very narrow?

A. I'm referring to my notes. From the -- from this point to the glove
was 19 feet, ten inches.

Q. Okay.

Now, we put the Bundy board back up, which is number --

MR. P. BAKER: Exhibit 67.

MR. BLASIER: -- 67.

Now, Mr. Leonard, you can go ahead and sit back down.

(Counsel resumes his seat.)

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Incidentally, the distance from Mr. Simpson's gate
to where the glove was found is even longer than the distance from
Bundy Drive all the way back to the alleyway at Bundy, isn't it?

A. The distance from the gate to the Bundy glove? And that distance --
I haven't done a measurement myself. I can take a look.

Q. Well, you can take a look. It's only 170 feet from the alleyway to
Bundy, according to plaintiffs' chart here, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. It's about 250 feet from Mr. Simpson's gate to where the glove was
found?

A. Between that and --

Q. Approximately?

A. Approximately, yes.

Q. 220.

Now, did I understand you to say that you confined yourself to just
the walkway and the caged-in area?

A. That is where my search was directed.

Q. Were you the criminalist in charge of processing that scene?

A. Yes.

Q. Was there somebody else that was to look other places?

A. Well, the detective had looked all over the crime scene, and he
pointed out the items of evidence he wanted me to concentrate on.

Q. That was Detective Lange?

A. Yes.

Q. He never told you about any blood on the back gate, did he?

A. I don't remember him telling me about the blood on the back gate.

Q. Now, the back gate is part of the walkway, is it not?

A. Yes, it is.

Q. Now, did you confine your search to just everything within a couple
inches of the ground?

A. No.

Q. So you looked higher than that. Was your area of responsibility a
little higher than that?

A. Yes.

Q. How many times did you walk in and out of the back gate while you
were processing that scene?

A. Several.

Q. And is it your testimony that you never looked at it?

A. It's my testimony that I don't remember seeing or having been -- I
don't remember being told about the blood on the back gate on that
day, and I don't remember seeing blood on the back gate that day.

Q. Your testimony was that you never looked at the back gate while you
were at Bundy?

A. I may have seen it, but I didn't search it, that I can remember.

Q. How long were you at Bundy?

A. I was there for about four hours.

Q. It was light the whole time, wasn't it?

A. Yes, it was.

Q. You had access to the whole area the whole time, didn't you?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Anybody ever tell you go look at the gate?

A. Nobody ever told me that.

Q. Now, you had made a reference in your direct testimony about
collecting things sequentially in terms of assigning them numbers. Do
you recall that?

A. Generally, we like to collect items of evidence sequentially, but
that's not a hard and fast rule.

Q. Well, you try to do that. Tell me why you try to do that.

A. Well, we try to number items of evidence in a logical manner; and
if it's in a logical manner, then, usually, they go in a sequential
order in regard to proximity.

Q. Now, who is it that directs the photographer to take pictures when
you're marking evidence?

A. That would be me or the criminalist in charge of the scene.

Q. And is it accurate that you have -- essentially, you have the
photographer walking with you, as you assign numbers to things in a
sequential order?

A. No, not really. I'll lay out the numbers and then have the
photographer take pictures after I've gone through, most of the time.
But again, that's not a hard and fast rule, either.

Q. Now, Mr. Fung, you are the one that assigns the numbers that are on
the little cards, correct?

A. Yes, I was at that scene.

Q. And all the cards that appear on the board there, 67, are cards
that you prepared and put on the ground, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, as far as the Bundy drops are concerned, the first drop is No.
112; is that correct?

A. The first drop along the trail?

Q. Correct.

A. Yes.

Q. And you gave that No. 112 as being the first drop closest to the
bodies, correct?

A. Excuse me?

Q. You can come look.

A. Yes; 112 is this one.

Q. And you're trying to process the crime scene in a logical sequence?

A. Attempting to, yes.

Q. And you gave the next drop 113, which was the next one in sequence.
You gave that a photo I.D. No. 113, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. You went further down the path and we get to 114, which is the next
drop in the sequence, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. You assigned that 114 consecutively, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Then we get back right by the back gate, we have 115, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And you assigned that sequentially because that's the next drop on
the way out?

A. Correct.

Q. By the way, how far is 115 from the gate?

A. From this gate?

Q. The back gate.

A. I don't have that measurement.

Q. Very close, isn't it?

A. Oh, it's possibly within 10 feet.

Q. Mr. Fung, what was No. 116?

A. No. 116 was a red stain on the front gate.

MR. BLASIER: We need a new number, Your Honor.

THE COURT: We want a new number.

MR. BLASIER: The next number.

THE CLERK: 2134.

(The instrument herein referred to as Photograph of stain No. 116 was
marked for identification as Defendants' Exhibit No. 2134.)

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Mr. Fung, let me show you what's been marked as
2134. That is a picture of stain 116 is it not?

A. That is a picture of photo item 116.

Q. Okay.

A. Or photo No. 116, which became item number --

Q. Fifty what?

A. 51.

Q. So you went from item 115, all the way back to the front gate, and
put the card on 116 and had a picture taken, correct?

A. Well, yes.

Q. Then you went all the way back out to 117, which is a drop on the
other side of the back gate, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. This is a different 116 than the one you collected on July 3, isn't
it?

A. Yes, it is.

Q. You looked on that back gate; you didn't find any blood. Somebody
had told you to look at the gate, and you went to the front gate,
didn't you?

A. I never -- I don't recall looking on the back gate that day.

Q. Why did you leave your sequence at 115 and go back to the front
gate and then come back out the back?

A. Ms. Mazzola saw that there was additional blood on the front gate
and said this would be a good area to get more blood from, because it
was in a different area than the other items of blood we had checked
around the caged-in area.

So I agreed to give her a number and let her collect that blood from
the front gate.

Q. She was collecting all of this blood along here, wasn't she?

A. Well, you have to realize that we are numbering first; and then as
we're going along, if we see something additionally and she's doing
something else and wants to -- and she wanted to collect the 116 while
I was numbering additional items of evidence down the line. She came
up to me and said, "I think we should collect more blood from the
front," and I gave her that number.

Q. And you collected one sample from the front gate and went back out
to the back?

A. I gave her -- I said, "Go ahead and get that blood that you want to
collect, photo I.D. No. 116."

Q. Is it your testimony that it's just a coincidence that the blood
drop No. 116 collected on July 3 from the back gate has the same
number as stain 6, 116 which you collected on the 13th?

A. It's quite a coincidence.

Q. Now, when you got to the Bundy scene, the print people were already
looking for fingerprints, weren't they?

A. At the Bundy scene?

Q. Yeah.

A. Yes.

Q. The things are checked for fingerprints, they put on graphite on
objects to try and determine whether there's a print there, correct? A
"dusting" it's called?

A. Well, they use dusting powder. It's made of different chemicals or
different compounds.

Q. When you're dusting for prints, if you get that on the blood, you
can really mess up the blood, can't you?

A. It's preferable to collect blood before printing.

Q. It's a horrible idea to have the print people out there before you
even get to the scene, isn't it?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Irrelevant, beyond the scope.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Who was responsible for sending the print people
out first?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Same objection.

MR. BLASIER: Do you know?

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. BLASIER: Can we have a ground, Your Honor?

THE COURT: Beyond the scope of the direct. I think this witness is
only testifying to blood and the items he recovered.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) You were in charge of this crime scene, were you
not, processing, Mr. Fung?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection.

THE WITNESS: Is there an objection?

THE COURT: You can answer it.

MR. BLASIER: You can try that one.

THE WITNESS: I was in charge of the evidence portion of the crime
scene.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Including?

A. Of the collection force.

Q. You weren't in charge of the fingerprint people?

A. I -- to a certain extent, I would tell them when I was done with my
collection, and then give them the go-ahead to start with their
portion of the crime-scene processing.

Q. They had already started before you even got there, didn't they?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: They had done certain portions of the crime scene.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) What portions?

A. I don't have a vivid memory of what portions they had started. They
were working on the inside; I do remember that, and possibly the
railings of the walkway.

Q. By the way, Mr. Fung, in this entire area that you served, there
wasn't a single fingerprint in blood, was there?

A. I'm not aware of any.

Q. The Bundy glove that was on the ground had very little blood on it,
didn't it?

A. I did not examine the Bundy glove very closely for the presence of
blood. I don't remember how much blood was on it?

Q. Didn't you see it when you got back to the lab, as well.

A. I did see it, but I didn't take a note of how much blood was on it
or -- I know that there was some blood on it, but I didn't examine it
very closely?

Q. By the way, at one point, isn't it accurate that you took the
Rockingham glove, carried it from Rockingham to Bundy, and took it
into the Bundy crime scene, climbing over Mr. Goldman's body, so that
Detective Lange could compare it with the Bundy glove?

A. That's correct.

Q. That's a horrible technique, isn't it?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Irrelevant.

THE COURT: On that basis, it's overruled.

MR. LAMBERT: Argumentative and beyond the scope.

THE COURT: Sustained as to that one.

MR. BLASIER: Beyond the scope?

THE COURT: No, argumentative.

MR. BLASIER: Okay.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Is it acceptable procedure to take evidence from
one bloody scene like that glove and take it to another second crime
scene?

A. If the evidence is handled in a careful manner, I don't see a
problem with it.

Q. Now, you didn't want to take that glove from Rockingham and carry
it into the Bundy crime scene, did you?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Irrelevant.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) You were ordered to do that by Detective Lange,
weren't you?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Hearsay.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: I was requested to do so.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) And you did?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Did you ever tell him that was a bad idea?

A. I told him that -- well, I made the conclusion in my mind that I
would not take the bag -- or the glove out of the bag for him. And I
felt that merely bringing the bag to the crime scene and opening it up
carefully would not compromise the scene.

Q. Now, you could have taken the Bundy glove and taken it out to the
crime scene truck and compared it there, couldn't you?

A. That's possible, yes.

Q. Now, isn't it accurate that there were quite a few police officers
that you had seen at Rockingham in the morning, 7 o'clock or 10
o'clock, when you were there, that were also at Bundy when you got
there after 10:00?

A. Actually, there were, that I recognized, less than ten.

Q. Let me ask you this: You made no effort, did you, to isolate the
two crime scenes in the sense of not having people traipsing back and
forth, did you?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Irrelevant.

THE COURT: Sustain the objection.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) You can move evidence back and forth from one
crime scene to another, even if it gets on your shoe, your clothing,
your hands or anything --

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Irrelevant and calls for speculation; assumes
facts not in evidence.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: If one isn't careful, it can occur.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Did you make any effort to isolate the Rockingham
scene from the Bundy scene in terms of people going back and forth?

MR. LAMBERT: That's been asked and answered. Same objection.
Irrelevant.

THE COURT: Did he make any attempts, sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Was there any attempt made that you're aware of to
isolate the two crime scenes so that people didn't come back and forth
and one to the other?

MR. LAMBERT: Same objections.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: No, that was not my responsibility.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) By the way, when you were at Rockingham in the
afternoon, did you see the Akita dog at Rockingham?

Do you remember seeing the dog?

A. There was a dog there, yes.

Q. And it was your understanding that was the dog they had found blood
on at Bundy?

A. I don't know which dog that was. I know there was a dog at the
Rockingham scene.

Q. Did you make any effort to isolate the Rockingham scene from blood
that might have been checked on items from the Bundy scene, like the
dog?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Irrelevant.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: Can you repeat that question?

MR. BLASIER: Sure.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Did you make any efforts to isolate the Rockingham
scene from things like blood from the Bundy -- coming from the Bundy
scene by way of a dog?

A. We tried to keep the dog away from the evidence or the fresh blood
drops.

Q. Who was assigned to watch the dog?

A. No one was specifically -- watched.

Q. That's the only effort that was made to isolate -- to keep the dog
from possibly tracking blood from Bundy into Rockingham?

A. Well, there were fresh blood stains at Rockingham. And when the dog
got near the stains, we shooed him around.

Q. Your answer is yes, that was the only effort made to protect the
Rockingham scene from blood that might be on the dog?

A. To the best of my knowledge, yes.

Q. When you were at the Bundy scene in the caged-in area -- that was,
again, an area of your responsibility, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Did you observe what appeared to be blood drops on Nicole Brown
Simpson's back?

A. By the time I had reached Bundy, she had already been moved or she
was in the process of being moved.

Q. Now, are you in charge of collecting evidence that might be on a
body?

A. The evidence that is on the body is the jurisdiction of the
coroner.

Q. And you're not allowed to even touch that, are you?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Irrelevant, beyond the scope.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: Usually not.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Is there any kind of scientific principle that
requires that you not have anything to do with the body, but the
coroner can?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Irrelevant.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Whose job is it to see that evidence that might be
on a body is preserved?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Irrelevant, outside the scope.

THE COURT: He says it's not his place.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Is it your responsibility to preserve imprint
evidence that might be at a crime scene?

A. Yes.

Q. And tell us what imprint evidence is.

A. Imprint evidence can be tool marks or shoe prints, tire tracks,
that sort of thing.

MR. BLASIER: Let me show you what's been marked as 40 previously.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Do you recognize this picture, Mr. Fung?

A. Yes, I do.

Q. That's a picture of Mark Fuhrman pointing at a glove?

A. I can't identify that as Mark Fuhrman, but it is somebody pointing
at the glove.

Q. That was an area of the crime scene that you had responsibility
over searching and preserving evidence?

A. Once I arrived there, yes.

Q. And that --

MR. BLASIER: Can you zoom in on that post by the knit cap.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Mr. Fung, do you see what appears to be parallel
line imprints on the post by the knit cap which I'm pointing to on the
screen?

A. I -- what was the question again?

Q. Do you see what appears to be parallel line imprints on the post
above the blood stain on the post by the knit cap?

A. I don't see the knit cap anymore, but I do see a -- some sort of
pattern on the post.

Q. Did you make any effort at all to preserve or closely photograph
that imprint?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Irrelevant, outside the scope.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: Other than general, overall, no.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Did you ever notice it at the time?

A. No.

Q. Let me show you what's previously been marked as 13 -- I'm sorry,
1532.

Mr. Fung, when you arrived at the crime scene at about 10:15 on the
13th, did you observe that piece of paper in the area right between
where the bodies were?

A. I do not recall seeing that piece of paper.

Q. It wasn't there, was it?

A. I don't know if it was there or not. I just don't recall seeing it.

MR. BLASIER: Well, let's zoom in on it.

MR. PETROCELLI: Can we have some exhibit numbers, Your Honor?

MR. BLASIER: I think I gave that, 1532.

MR. PETROCELLI: Previous photo.

MR. P. BAKER: Previous photos was 40.

MR. BLASIER: I'm sorry, 40.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Mr. Fung, do you see what appears to be similar
imprint evidence on that piece of paper?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. No foundation; calls for speculation, calls
for conclusion.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: Without benefit of a ruler or scale within that picture,
I cannot make that determination.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) That's one of the reasons why you collect such
things as pieces of paper that has that kind of imprint evidence on
it, isn't it, so that you can do those kinds of tests?

A. That's one of the reasons, yes.

Q. Now, you were trying to find out whether there might have been a
second set of shoe prints at Bundy other than the bloody ones, weren't
you?

A. That had gone through my mind, yes.

Q. And the area on this piece of paper that I'm indicating up in this
area and along in here, those were all consistent with possible shoe
imprints, aren't they.

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Lack of foundation, calls for speculation.

THE COURT: You may answer if you can.

THE WITNESS: Just by looking at those two patterns, I wouldn't say
they were shoe prints.

Q. That would be?

A. In evidence.

Q. You would definitely collect that, had you seen it, wouldn't you,
Mr. Fung? It was right between the two bodies and had blood on it.

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Calls for speculation.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Did Detective Lange ever tell you that he already
looked at that in the field and decided it had no evidentiary value?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Hearsay.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Did Detective Lange ever give you any instructions
with respect to that piece of paper?

A. I don't recall him mentioning that piece of paper to me at the
crime scene, no.

Q. Is it an appropriate procedure to make an assessment at the crime
scene on an item such as this, as to whether or not it has evidentiary
value, just by looking at it?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Irrelevant.

THE COURT: It's irrelevant as to this witness.

MR. BLASIER: Your honor, this might be a good time.

THE COURT: Okay.

Ladies and gentlemen, we'll adjourn.

MR. LAMBERT: Can we approach for a second, Your Honor?

In light of today's testimony, we've all agreed that there is no need
for the 402 hearing on the presumptive blood test. We can go on to
evidence without that hearing.

MR. BLASIER: I agree.

THE COURT: Okay.

8:30 tomorrow.

Again, please don't talk about the case; don't form or express any
opinions; and don't read, hear, or watch anything concerning this
case.

JURORS: Thank you.

THE COURT: You're excused and ordered to come back tomorrow.

(At 4:30 p.m., an adjournment was taken until Tuesday, November 5,
1996, at 8:30 a.m.)

REPORTER'S DAILY TRANSCRIPT
NOVEMBER 5, 1996

SUPERIOR COURT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA
FOR THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES

SHARON RUFO, ET AL., N/A, PLAINTIFFS,

VS.

ORENTHAL JAMES SIMPSON, ET AL., DEFENDANTS.


SANTA MONICA, CALIFORNIA
TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 5, 1996
10:00 A.M.

DEPARTMENT NO. WEQ
HON. HIROSHI FUJISAKI, JUDGE

(REGINA D. CHAVEZ, OFFICIAL REPORTER)

(The following proceedings were held in open court, outside the
presence of the jury.)

THE COURT: Somebody said they have something.

MR. BAKER: Yes, Your Honor, as of Saturday, the deposition of Terry
Lee was taken. And that was the witness who you may recall they had
designated as a witness by the name of Karnes. We had noticed Mr.
Karnes' deposition.

THE COURT: Yeah, I remember.

MR. BAKER: That deposition was taken on Saturday, and Mr. Lambert
would not produce the notes of Mr. Karnes, saying we weren't entitled
-- Mr. Lee, Terry Lee, saying we weren't entitled to those notes.

Now, obviously when we had noticed the depositions of their experts,
we, like they, had noticed the depositions for all the writings,
everything. And because of the Court's allowing Terry Lee to be
deposed late, we didn't send out any notice.

Mr. Lambert wouldn't allow those notes to be turned over to us. And
what I would request of the Court is that the notes be turned over to
us pursuant to your order that after we have reviewed the notes, we'd
be allowed to retake his deposition at their expense if there's
anything in the notes that we deem that -- requires us to take his
deposition.

MR. LAMBERT: As Mr. Baker admitted in his argument, Your Honor, they
never requested the notes, never requested anything of Terry Lee.

And, in fact, what these notes were, I myself have never seen them;
they were simply some notes he took when he was reviewing other
documents. They're not a report that he generated; they're not his
opinion; they're simply notes.

And in fact, as it turned out, Mr. Blasier asked him extensive
questions about the notes, and Dr. Lee read from them to him during
the deposition.

So he's effectively already examined him on the notes. But they
didn't formally request them, and I've never seen them. I really, I
suppose, don't have a problem with asking him to copy them and turn
them over to both of us, if that's what they want to do. But I don't
think there's any need for further examinations, since he's already
examined him on the notes anyway.

MR. BLASIER: I specifically asked for the notes. Mr. Lambert said he
was instructing the witness not to turn them over. I did not question
him on the notes. We'd like an opportunity to get the notes and
reopen the deposition, if necessary.

THE COURT: You're busting up our furniture.

MR. LAMBERT: Our little sign is broken.

(Indicating to plaintiff sign.)

THE COURT: I think that better be replaced before Judge Light gets
back.

THE BAILIFF: I am going to.

THE COURT: Okay. The Court will order that the notes be made
available to the defense, and upon defense's examination, should
further deposition be necessary, you may have them.

MR. BAKER: Thank you.

Just one other thing, Your Honor. And I apologize for those
housekeeping matters, but we're in a situation where we're supposed
to, as you know, and I think the Court is aware, get the witnesses
three days before the witness gets to the witness stand, and have
three days' worth of witnesses, so that we can prepare and they can
prepare, et cetera.

We're not getting anything except -- and I understand the complexity
of putting on a case of this magnitude. I think it's still important
that we get the witnesses in the order that they're going to put them
on.

Now, sometimes they have to be changed. I can understand that; but
we're not getting the witnesses and we're not getting three days'
worth of witnesses. And we need to be ready so that we can proceed and
they can proceed in a timely fashion. And that's the Court order and
I'd request that it be enforced.

MR. PETROCELLI: You know, I don't think it's appropriate to bring
these things up on the record. We've had ample discussions about this.

I've given him all the witnesses for the week, not three days, for the
whole week, in the order in which they will be presented.

And we have a hearing that we requested on Thursday regarding Park
Dietz on the Kelly Frye issue.

And we have Dr. Spitz on Friday. We have the glove witnesses. We
have the conclusion of Fung. We have Brockbank; we have Scull's
deposition; we have another deposition.

I gave him all the witnesses as I gave Your Honor yesterday afternoon,
and I gave them to him last Friday, gave him a couple more on
Saturday, and a couple more yesterday, to round out the week.

And just so the record is clear, next week we're going to be doing all
the blood and DNA witnesses: Robin Cotton, Gary Sims, Renee
Montgomery, and Colin Yamauchi. And if we still have time left -- we
only have a four-day week next week -- we will be going to William
Bodziak to round out for the next two weeks, and Doug Deedrick, as
well.

THE COURT: Would you -- excuse me. Would you endeavor to ensure that
the order in which they are going to be presented be made known to the
defense.

MR. PETROCELLI: Absolutely. I did give them the order; okay.

THE COURT: Now, what is this about Thursday? I thought yesterday you
told me you weren't going to have a hearing.

MR. PETROCELLI: That was a presumptive test hearing. This is on the
witnesses who will testify about what they call profiling.

Park Dietz is an expert witness that we want to call and we would like
to have that hearing Thursday morning.

THE COURT: All right.

MR. PETROCELLI: Thank you.

MR. LEONARD: Just for clarification, you said witnesses. It's not
going to be --

MR. PETROCELLI: Park Dietz only.

MR. GELBLUM: At this time?

MR. LEONARD: Excuse me?

MR. GELBLUM: At this time?

MR. LEONARD: Why don't we do the hearing at the same time.

MR. GELBLUM: They're very different opinions, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Excuse me; what other witness?

MR. GELBLUM: Donald Dutton, Your Honor Donald Dutton.

THE COURT: What's he going to be offered for?

MR. GELBLUM: He's offered for opinion on both post-homicide demeanor
and for --

THE COURT: We'll do it at the same time. Let's not waste our time

MR. GELBLUM: Your Honor, Mr. Dutton -- I don't think Dr. Dutton is
available on Thursday. I haven't cleared his availability.

THE COURT: Excuse me?

MR. GELBLUM: I haven't checked his availability, Your Honor.

They're different kinds of opinions; they're entirely different.

THE COURT: Really?

MR. GELBLUM: Yes, sir.

THE COURT: I say "really" not to demean your position; but you know I
did read those moving papers, and that's why I say "really," when you
say they're different. You know I'm not speaking from ignorance; I
read your papers.

MR. GELBLUM: Well, Your Honor, the moving papers were filed by the
defense and they only talk about one witness; that's why you possibly
have the impression --

THE COURT: No, there's reference to both of them.

Okay. Let's get on with this one.

Bring the jury in, please.

(Jurors resume their respective seats.)

(The following proceedings were held in open court, in the presence of
the jury.)

THE COURT: Morning, ladies and gentlemen.

JUROR: Morning.

THE COURT: We had one of those mornings, so I apologize for a late
start.

THE CLERK: Sir, you're still under oath.

Would you state your name again for the record.

THE WITNESS: My name is Dennis Fung, D-E-N-N-I-S, F-U-N-G.

DENNIS FUNG, the witness on the stand at the time of adjournment of
Monday, November 4, 1996, having been previously duly sworn, was
examined and testified further as follows:

CROSS-EXAMINATION (Continued) BY MR. BLASIER:

Q. Morning, Mr. Fung.

Now, Mr. Fung, what time was it that you arrived at Bundy?

A. Referring to my notes, I arrived at Bundy at approximately 10:15
in the morning.

Q. Now, would you agree it was your responsibility to completely
document, collect, and receive the physical evidence at Bundy?

A. It was my responsibility to document and collect the evidence
that I collected at Bundy.

Q. Was there anybody else collecting evidence at Bundy?

A. No. Myself and Ms. Mazzola were the ones who were collecting
the items of evidence away from the body.

Q. Who was in charge of collecting items of evidence near the body?

A. Near the bodies would have been our responsibility, also.

Q. So you had the responsibility of collecting all the evidence at
the Bundy crime scene, correct?

A. Well, the evidence on the body and the body itself are the
jurisdiction of the coroner.

Q. Okay. It is correct, crime scene processing procedure, is it
not, to fully process, identify, photograph, document each piece of
evidence before it's collected? Correct?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection irrelevant.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: Can you repeat that?

Q. It is correct evidence collection procedure, to document each
item of evidence before it is moved or collected? Correct?

A. That's the best -- when it's possible, that's the best way to do
it, yes.

Q. An the goal is to try and preserve the crime scene as close as
possible to the way it was at the time of the crime, correct?

A. As things are changed, if they're documented, it would be
permissible to move things.

I mean, if you have to move things and you document that they are
moved, then you -- it's permissible?

MR. BLASIER: I move to strike the answer as nonresponsive.

THE COURT: Denied.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Don't you try to keep the crime scene the same
way it was when you -- it was found, Mr. Fung, so you can document
everything in its original position?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Irrelevant and beyond the scope, Your Honor.

THE COURT: I'll allow it, but start moving; otherwise, I'm going to
sustain it.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Do you understand the question, Mr. Fung?

A. I'm not exactly sure what you're getting at.

Q. Let me ask it this way: There was a substantial amount of
evidence in the immediate vicinity of the bodies, was there not?

A. Yes, there was.

Q. When you got there at 10:00 or 10:15 in the morning, the
coroner's office was already there, in the process of moving the
bodies?

A. Yes, they were.

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Relevance, beyond the scope.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Does that concern you, that the bodies were
being moved before you had a chance to document the evidence around
the bodies?

MR. LAMBERT: Same objection.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. Did you discuss with Detective Lange that that was a bad
practice, to move the bodies before you had a chance to document the
crime scene?

MR. LAMBERT: Same objection.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Mr. Fung, let me show you what's been
previously marked as 101.

Why don't you tell me what that is, Mr. Fung.

A. That is a photograph depicting a glove and a card next to it
with the number 102.

Q. And that is a card that you or Andrea Mazzola put next to the
glove prior to collecting it, correct?

A. Yes.

MR. BLASIER: Let me show you what's been marked as 40.

(Referring to Exhibit 40.)

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) You recognize the picture of Detective Fuhrman
pointing at the glove?

A. I do recognize that as the glove being in the relatively same
position.

Q. Well, "relatively?"

It's in a different position, isn't it. Mr. Fung?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Calls for conclusion; lack of foundation.

THE COURT: You may examine, see whether or not it's in the same or
different position.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) The position has been altered, hasn't it?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Calls for conclusion; lacks foundation.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) You never saw the glove when it was in the
first position in Exhibit 40, did you?

A. I only saw the glove in the position in photo -- I guess it's
Exhibit 101.

Q. And were you able to document at all at the scene how that glove
got moved?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Lack of foundation.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: I was not aware that it was moved.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Okay.

So you have no way of knowing whether it was picked up, taken
someplace, and placed back in that position, do you?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Assumes facts not in evidence.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Let me show you what's been marked as People's
1 -- I'm sorry -- Exhibit 103. That's a picture of the envelope with
the tag 104 next to it that was placed there by you or Andrea Mazzola
just prior to collection, correct?

A. That is correct.

Q. Let me show you 90.

That's the envelope in a different position, isn't it, Mr. Fung?

A. It appears to be in a different position.

Q. You can tell because of the grout line that the envelope has
been altered, hasn't it?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Assumes facts not in evidence; calls for
speculation.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. BLASIER: Did you make any inquiries at the scene about whether
you were collecting evidence -- about whether the scene had been
altered?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Irrelevant, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Are you familiar with a term, "a close-in
crime scene?"

A. I've heard it during the criminal trial, but I had never heard
of that term before that.

Q. You familiar with a technique of collecting evidence in a
close-in crime scene, where you do not disturb the bodies before you
have a chance to document the evidence around the bodies?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Irrelevant; beyond the scope.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Now, you did what's called a stride analysis,
pertaining to the Bundy drops, did you not?

A. Pertaining to the shoe prints, yes.

Q. The shoe prints. And that's a way of measuring the distance
between the shoe prints to determine whether somebody -- the person
who left the shoe prints is running or walking, correct?

A. Roughly, yes.

Q. And you determined that whoever left those shoe prints was not
running, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, with respect to the Bundy drops and each of those swatches
that you use for a drop, it is just a small piece of cotton; it is not
a cloth?

A. They vary in size, but they're probably usually smaller than the
size of your fingernail.

Q. And they don't have any kind of marking on them that allows to
you distinguish one from the other, do they?

A. No.

Q. Once you use them to collect a blood stain, you can't tell one
from any other one, can you?

A. No. That's why we take great care in labeling each item of
evidence as we go along.

Q. You take great care at labeling each item of evidence so that
you can track it later?

A. What do you mean "track?"

Q. To determine whether it's been tampered with or not later.

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Assumes facts not in evidence.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) To determine whether it's been altered later?

MR. LAMBERT: Same objection.

THE COURT: You may answer.

THE WITNESS: The evidence is kept in a secure location and it's kept
in a locked facility. So I wouldn't -- there's never been any type of
altering that I'm aware of, so I don't count the swatches, no.

Q. Mr. Fung, you don't count the swatches, the number of swatches
that you take per drop, do you?

A. I do not.

Q. You do not diagram them so that you can recognize them at some
later time, to make sure what's in the bindle later is what you put
into it originally, do you?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Irrelevant; assumes facts not in evidence;
beyond the scope.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) You don't do that either, do you?

A. No.

Q. You don't photograph them, do you?

A. No.

Q. Now, the swatches that you made -- incidentally, did you try to
collect all of the blood in each of the drops at Bundy?

A. I collected a representative sample from the drops and tried to
collect as much as -- as possible.

Q. My question is, did you collect all of the blood from the drops
at Bundy?

A. Not completely, no.

Q. How did you determine when to stop?

A. When several cloth swatches were dampened -- or reddened by the
stain, then, and it appeared that by putting more swatches on the
stain, nothing would come up, or very little would come up, we
stopped.

Q. So, you swatch it until you can no longer get any more blood off
the surface?

A. But there's still always going to be residual.

Q. You try to get up as much as is there, correct?

A. Well, at the Bundy scene, yeah.

Q. That's because you can't tell how much you might need for DNA
testing, correct, just by looking at it?

A. Just by looking at it, no.

Q. Now, the swatches that -- incidentally, you indicated that you
realized it was a mistake when you were -- when you were at
Rockingham, to have Andrea Mazzola in charge of processing the crime
scene, correct?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Misstates the evidence. Assumes facts not
in evidence.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Let me show you part of 212 -- actually, let
me show you all of 212 now.

MR. PETROCELLI: Is 212 all one exhibit?

MR. BLASIER: Intended.

MR. PETROCELLI: What do you mean, intended? Is it on the joint trial
statement as one exhibit?

MR. BLASIER: We'll give it another number.

MR. PETROCELLI: This is not 21 on the joint trial statement.

MR. PETROCELLI: We'll give it a new number.

MR. BLASIER: 2135.

MR. PETROCELLI: This is a collection of documents.

Let me show you 2135, Mr. Fung.

Are those your original crime-scene notes from the work you did at
Rockingham at 7 o'clock -- starting at 7:15 in the morning?

(The instrument herein referred to as Dennis Fung's original
Rockingham crime-scene notes was marked for identification as
Defendants' Exhibit No. 2135.)

(Witness reviews documents.)

THE WITNESS: This appears to be some of them, not all of them.

Q. Those are -- all the documents that are contained in that
packet, however, are from the work that you did at Rockingham,
correct?

A. Yes, but it's not complete.

Q. Now, who made out these documents?

A. Those were primarily filled out by criminalist Mazzola.

Q. And this is the document -- the front page of this document is
the one that lists Mazzola as the officer in charge, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Is it correct procedure to write these notes in pencil?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Irrelevant.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) These are all written in pencil, are they not.

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Irrelevant.

THE COURT: You may answer.

THE WITNESS: Yes, they are.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Now, at some point you made the decision that
Andrea Mazzola should not be the officer in charge, correct?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Asked and answered yesterday.

THE COURT: Sustained. That was yesterday.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) All right. Did you make any efforts to
correct the paperwork to show that she was not the officer in charge?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Irrelevant.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Mr. Fung, of the blood, how many blood stains
did you collect from Bundy?

A. On what date?

Q. On the morning of the 13th.

(Witness reviews document in notebook.)

A. Let me recount.

Fourteen.

Q. How many of those were actually collected, swatched by Andrea
Mazzola?

A. I don't recall the exact number.

Q. Most of them, correct?

A. Most of them, probably, yes.

Q. And how many stains did you collect at Rockingham on the 13th?

A. Inside and outside?

Q. Yes.

(Witness reviews document.)

A. I believe eight.

Q. How many of those did she collect, as opposed to you?

A. Again, I don't know the exact number, but she primarily did most
of the swatching.

Q. And the crime-scene notes at Rockingham, she wrote these, as
well?

A. Primarily, yes.

Q. Did you, at any point in time when you changed her
responsibilities as not being the officer in charge, did you actually
change anything that she was assigned to do?

A. Well, as the officer in charge, she would have decided the
priority of evidence on how to go ahead and process the scene. And
when I took charge, then I took that role.

Q. But you had her do all the work, didn't you, most of it?

A. Well, not most of it, but I had her doing a lot of the active
part, yeah.

Q. You were doing the mental part?

A. Well, I was -- I was also doing a lot of physical work, also,
not just mental.

Q. Let me show you part of your checklist from Rockingham. And
this is a little difficult to see because it's in pencil.

MR. BLASIER: Can we zoom in on -- okay.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) This contains a list of items collected at
Rockingham, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And there's a column on this form where you indicate who it was
collected by, correct?

A. Yes, there is.

Q. You left that completely blank, didn't you?

A. Because we were working as a team, I did not feel that it was
necessary to fill that in at the time.

Q. All right. It was left blank on the Bundy crime-scene notes, as
well?

A. For the same reason, yes.

Q. Now, that form is a form that's used by your department at crime
scenes to process evidence, isn't it?

A. It is a -- it is a form, yes.

Q. And the purpose of filling out this form is to completely and
accurately document who does what at the crime scene; that's one of
the purposes, is it not?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Irrelevant.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: My understanding of this form is to help the criminalist
document a scene as information becomes appropriate to fill in, as it
becomes relevant.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) And who an item was collected by, is not
relevant information, in your view?

A. Not when you're working as a team. If we had broken up into
different teams or we had separated our tasks, then I would have
thought it more appropriate to fill that column in. But we -- because
we were working as a team, that was not an issue to me.

Q. Now, at some later time, when you tried to reconstruct who had
done what, it became an issue?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Irrelevant; beyond the scope.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: Yes.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) And you did take several months after
processing the crime scene, didn't you.

MR. LAMBERT: Same objection.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: I didn't recall exactly when we did it, but after it had
become an issue in one of the hearings, then we went back to try to
reconstruct who did exactly what.

Q. Now, when these crime-scene checklists are done at a crime
scene, what's the process that you do after they're done?

Does somebody look at them to approve them?

A. In general, yes, somebody does review them.

Q. Who?

A. That would be the criminalist 3 in charge of the field unit or
another supervisor.

Q. And who would it have been in this case?

A. Let's see. That would have been Ron Raquel or Jo Gaurin.

Q. Now, if Andrea Mazzola filled out this crime-scene checklist, it
would be your responsibility, as her supervisor --

THE COURT: Mr. Blasier, it wasn't filled out. It wasn't checked out.

You may examine as to who found what, if that's where you're going. 
But the rest of it, the procedures, I'm going to find to be
irrelevant. You may ask what was found by whom on this case, if that
is what you want to find out. If you don't want to find out, then
move on to another area.

MR. BLASIER: Yes, Your Honor.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Did you review these forms for correctness?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Irrelevant.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: I reviewed them for accuracy, yes.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Let me show you one page of the field notes
before I put on the Elmo.

I want you to tell me what that particular page is.

A. This is a document from the crime-scene checklist that has
different tests and observations that were made during the -- during
the search.

Q. That's where, from Rockingham, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. There's writing on the back of that, isn't there?

A. Yes, there is.

Q. And it's the back of this page that --

MR. PETROCELLI: Excuse me. For the record, what is that exhibit?

MR. BLASIER: This is the new exhibit, 2135.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) It's the back of this document that lists O.J.
Simpson's blood vial as number 18; isn't that correct?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Asked and answered yesterday.

THE COURT: Sustained. We went through this exhibit yesterday.

MR. BLASIER: I don't think I went through this with him.

THE COURT: Yes, you did.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Mr. Fung, there are erasures on this form, are
there not?

A. Yes, there are.

Q. At some point, you went back to try and change this, didn't you?

A. I was going to change it and didn't know whether I'd be accused
of altering documents or not, so I erased.

MR. BLASIER: Can we zoom in on the erasure.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Now, that case that you tried to change that
--

MR. BLASIER: Zoom out a little bit.

Let me turn it this way so we can read it a little bit better.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) That says 75, 94 with your initials doesn't
it?

A. Yes.

Q. You tried to change that document in July, didn't you?

A. Well, I was correcting --

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Irrelevant; beyond the scope.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: I was correcting what I saw as inconsistencies in the
recording of the evidence.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) And the reason that number had to be changed
from 18 to 17 is because if it was item 18, it would indicate it was
collected after the tennis shoes, which weren't collected until the
morning of the 14th; isn't that correct?

MR. LAMBERT: Argumentative, irrelevant.

THE COURT: I think you asked that yesterday.

MR. BLASIER: Let me show you another document from 2135.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Tell us what that particular sheet is.

A. This is an evidence collection report. It's a sheet from the
crime-scene checklist from Rockingham.

Q. And whose handwriting is on that form?

A. Parts of it is Ms. Mazzola's and part of it is mine.

Q. Now, Mr. Fung, that indicates -- the top item as 18 and the next
item as 17, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. Would you agree that there is --

MR. BLASIER: Zoom in on 18.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) -- that there is originally a different --
somebody started a different number there?

A. Yes.

Q. When was that change made? Do you know?

A. I don't know the exact date of when that was changed.

Q. Mr. Fung, we talked a little bit about the change of position of
the gloves.

Are the pictures with the two different positions, there was actually
a third position that that glove was in before it was collected; isn't
that correct?

A. I'm not aware of a third position.

Q. There's a position of a glove on the blanket that had been used
to cover Nicole Brown Simpson's body, correct?

A. I'm not aware of that.

MR. BLASIER: Your Honor, I'd like to play video 911, please.

Could you look at this video, Mr. Fung.

MR. LAMBERT: Objection to the lack of foundation for the video.

MR. BLASIER: Well, I'll ask him about it.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Does this appear to be the Bundy scene?

A. I can't -- looks like scrambled cable.

MR. BLASIER: Can you play a little bit?

MR. P. BAKER: Yeah.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) You see this, Mr. Fung?

(Indicating to video.)

A. That's the --

Q. That's the glove, isn't it, Mr. Fung?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Lack of foundation; irrelevant.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: I'd have to see that more clearly.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) You've seen this video a number of times,
haven't you, Mr. Fung?

A. (No verbal response.)

Q. That's you putting a card down by it, isn't it, Mr. Fung?

A. Well, I am putting a card in that area, yes.

Q. That glove is on the tile there, isn't it, Mr. Fung?

A. I can't determine that.

Q. Do you know how it got there?

A. No, I don't.

Q. Appears to be on the blanket there, doesn't it, Mr. Fung?

A. There appears to be a dark area there. I can't determine what
that object is, though.

THE COURT: The jury -- at this point, Mr. Blasier, the Court is going
to admonish the jury that the evidence has not established that that
is a glove at this point. So you may not consider that a glove until
somebody establishes that it is a glove, okay?

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Well, Mr. Fung, can you tell us what it is,
other than the glove?

A. I have no idea.

THE COURT: That doesn't make it a glove, either, ladies and
gentlemen. So I'll sustain a foundation objection because there's no
foundation.

MR. BLASIER: Your honor, the video speaks for itself.

THE COURT: It doesn't establish that's a glove, Mr. Blasier. This
witness can't identify it, so you have a foundation problem.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Mr. Fung, the LAPD doesn't take videos of
crime scenes to document where things are, do they?

A. Not that I'm aware of.

Q. This is all video that was taken by media outside of the area,
correct?

A. From my understanding, yes.

Q. Now, this video does show the blanket that was left on the
ground after Nicole Brown Simpson's body was moved, correct?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Lack of foundation; calls for speculation;
conclusion.

THE COURT: You may answer, if you know.

THE WITNESS: When I arrived at the scene, the blanket was on the
ground.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Now, this video is a video of the Bundy scene
while you were there, correct?

A. Yes.

MR. BLASIER: Could we see the part where the card is put down,
please.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Now, Mr. Fung, that is you putting down a card
by an item on the tile, correct, or what appears to be on the tile?

A. Somewhere near the edge of the tile, yes.

Q. Other than the envelope -- in fact, the envelope was on dirt, as
well.

Was there any piece of evidence that you recovered from the tiled
area, as indicated by your notes?

A. There was an area an area -- let's see. There was a sticker that
was collected on the tile and a blood stain that was checked on the
tile itself.

Q. Which stain was checked on the tile?

A. Photo I.D. 107, which was by the base of the stairs.

Q. All right.

MR. BLASIER: Can we see where the card's being put down again,
please.

(Video is played.)

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) The card you put down is not by the base of
the stairs, is it, Mr. Fung?

A. No, it's not.

Q. So that's not 107, is it?

A. No, it's not.

Q. Where was the label found?

A. The label was found in the center of the walkway area.

Q. Okay. The card you're putting down here is right on the other
side of this object, right by the tile, is it not?

A. That's correct.

Q. The label was over in a different area, wasn't it, Mr. Fung?

A. Yes, it was.

Q. Tell me, can you tell from your notes what item you were
collecting with that card?

A. I could make a guess. I don't know exactly what item I was
labeling at that point in time.

Q. Now, there was -- the envelope was recovered from the dirt area.
 And who actually collected that item?

A. The envelope was collected by Ms. Mazzola.

Q. And isn't it correct that the envelope was picked up by her and
handed to you, with your bare hands?

A. That's incorrect.

MR. BLASIER: Could we see video 915, please.

(Video 915 being played.)

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Please look at this video, Mr. Fung, and tell
us if this is a video of you and Andrea Mazzola at the crime scene,
the Bundy scene.

Do you recognize it, Mr. Fung?

A. Somewhat.

MR. BLASIER: Now, just hold it here for a second.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) This person here is from the coroner's office,
correct?

A. Yes.

Q. As well as this person, correct?

A. I don't recognize his face.

Q. Okay. This is the person from the coroner's office that helped
move the bodies, correct?

A. If she was the coroner's representative, yes.

Q. All right. Let's go ahead and play this.

I want you to watch behind her and tell us, wasn't that you picking up
the envelope after it was handed to you by Andrea Mazzola?

A. No, it was not.

I have reviewed the tape before, and it's too bad that this is in
black and white right now. If it was in color, you'd be able to see
that that is a manila envelope, and the envelope that is the item of
evidence is actually white.

Q. So you have a better video of this?

A. I remember from reviewing the tapes during the criminal trial,
that it was a manila envelope; and the envelope -- this is a manila
envelope in the video, and the item of evidence is a white envelope
with red stains on it.

Q. So the white envelope was put into a manila envelope?

A. No, it was not.

Q. You testified at the criminal trial that that was a tablet,
didn't you?

A. I --

MR. LAMBERT: Objection, Your Honor. Assumes facts in not in
evidence.

If he has a reference in the criminal transcript, he better show it to
him.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: I testified that that's what it could have been.

Q. You didn't testify that it was a manila envelope, did you?

A. I didn't at that time, no.

Q. Incidentally, did you preserve the white envelope for possible
fingerprints?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Beyond the scope; irrelevant.

THE COURT: Overruled.

If it is a recovered piece of evidence, you may inquire about it.

THE WITNESS: The envelope was placed in a paper bag, I believe. So
if prints were deemed applicable to that item of evidence by whoever
was making that determination, then it could have been performed.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Let me show you 90, which is another picture
of the envelope.

Let's back out, first of all.

Does that appear to be a picture of the envelope?

A. A blurry picture at this point.

Q. Okay.

MR. BLASIER: Can we focus that a little bit?

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) And that appears to be the envelope in which
position, the first one or the second one?

A. I don't remember.

Q. That corresponds to Exhibit 90, appears to be in the first
position, correct?

A. Yes, Exhibit 90.

Q. Now, one of the things that's important about collecting
evidence such as this is, if there's any debris on it, it's important
to try and preserve that, correct?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Irrelevant.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Mr. Fung, let me show you 103, the envelope,
in the second position.

There is much less debris on the envelope in the second position where
you collected it than in the first position, isn't there?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Irrelevant.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: There does appear to be different -- yes, it's
different.

MR. BLASIER: Okay.

Can you zoom in on the right -- upper right corner of the envelope,
please.

I don't know if we can see it very well.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Mr. Fung, do you see the parallel line
imprints on the envelope on the upper right-hand corner?

You can actually see it a little better on here.

A. I do see a pattern there.

Q. That appears to be similar to the pattern that was on the piece
of paper we looked at yesterday, doesn't it.

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Irrelevant; calls for conclusion; lack of
foundation.

MR. LAMBERT: Beyond the scope.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: Without benefit for a measuring device, I can't make
that determination.

MR. BLASIER: Let me switch gears here for a second.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Mr. Fung, on July 3, you went back to Bundy to
collect the stains on the back gate, correct?

A. July 3, yes.

Q. And let me show you a picture that has previously been marked as
2100.

Right there.

Sergeant Rossi circled where I have my finger on this picture as being
blood. And I think he said it was absolutely blood.

That's not blood, is it, Mr. Fung?

A. I can't tell from the picture.

Q. Did you collect a spot at that location?

A. I collected a spot in that -- near that location, yes.

Q. At that location?

A. At this point in time, I can't determine whether -- because of
the picture, whether that was the stain or that was the stain.

(Indicating.)

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) You collected everything that you saw there
that looked like a blood stain, didn't you?

A. Yes.

Q. And you collected one drop in the area of that card 116,
correct?

A. From the best of my recollection, yes.

Q. Let me show you 2090 -- 2098. This is a picture where Officer
Terrazas has circled what he said was absolutely blood.

That's not blood, either, is it, Mr. Fung?

A. Again, I cannot determine from that picture on the video screen
which one of those is the actual stain.

Q. Did you collect all the blood from the back gate that you saw on
the 3rd?

A. Not all of this -- of it for -- I collected a representative
sample. I collected as much of it as I could.

Q. Do you have any record of any stain being on the mesh on the
inside above 116?

A. There was an area above that, that was item 117, that I
collected.

Q. That was on the other side of the gate, wasn't it, Mr. Fung?

A. Yes, it was.

Q. Did you see any evidence of blood on the mesh right above 116?

A. There was other blood present on the gate; however, I collected
the best stains there.

Q. There wasn't anything above the card on 116 that you observed,
was there, Mr. Fung?

A. I didn't make note of it, but I know there was additional --
there was blood that I did not collect on the gate at that time.

Q. And the reason you went out there was supposedly because blood
had been left there from June 13, correct.

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Argumentative.

THE COURT: 2090 is not that picture?

MR. BLASIER: 2098.

THE CLERK: Thank you.

Q. That was the purpose you went out there on July 3; supposedly
you missed blood on the 13th, correct.

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Argumentative.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. MR. BLASIER: Are you saying, Mr. Fung, that you left more blood
on the back gate after July 3?

A. There was more blood on the back gate. I collected a
representative sample.

MR. BLASIER: I need to get another board, Your Honor.

Do we have a number on this one?

MR. P. BAKER: 168.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Mr. Fung, that appears to be pictures of the
Bronco that you processed on June 14, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. By the way, one of those stains that you collected on the 14th
is stain 29, is it not?

MR. P. BAKER: That's 211, not 1168.

THE COURT: What is this?

MR. P. BAKER: 211.

THE WITNESS: What is the number you were asking about?

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) 29.

A. Yes.

Q. That was a blood stain, or apparent blood stain on the steering
wheel of the Bronco, was it not?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, when you observed stains 30 and 31, you observed them
clearly on the 14th of June, correct?

A. 30 and 31?

Q. On the console.

A. Yes.

Q. They were easy to see, weren't they,

A. They weren't real easy to see; I had to use a flashlight and to
detect them.

Q. On June 14?

A. Yes.

Q. During daylight, you had to use a flashlight?

A. Yes.

Well, the Bronco was in the print shed.

Q. Okay.

Now, did you make an effort to collect all of 30 and 31?

A. I collected a representative sample from 30 and 31.

Q. Did you collect all of it, Mr. Fung?

MR. LAMBERT: Asked and answered.

MR. BLASIER: He didn't answer the question.

THE COURT: You can answer yes or no.

THE WITNESS: No, I did not.

Q. Did you make any notation in any report anywhere that you had
not collected all of the blood from the console on June 14?

A. No notation of that was made.

Q. Did you tell anyone, after the 14th, when you came back from
processing the Bronco, that there was still more blood on the console
that you didn't collect?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Irrelevant.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) How did you determine how much of the stain to
collect, Mr. Fung?

A. After collecting a swatch that was darkened, I stopped
collecting at that point.

Q. Why?

A. Because I did not see more stain coming up on that on that
swatch. It was a difficult area to collect or trans -- transfer the
stain on, so I collected one swatch's worth and stopped.

Q. Why was it difficult?

A. It's, -- it appeared to. It didn't come off easily.

Q. It didn't come off easily; that's why you didn't collect all of
it?

A. I collected one swatch's worth, and it was dark, so I determined
that was enough for --

Q. For what?

A. For me to collect.

Q. Enough for testing?

A. From that light of stain, yes.

Q. So you felt that what you collected was sufficient for DNA
testing?

A. Not for DNA testing. I wasn't making that determination at that
time.

Q. So you weren't thinking about the possibility of DNA testing
being done on what you collected from the console?

A. That's correct.

Q. And why not?

A. It was such a light stain that I was thinking mostly about
conventional serology for that -- for that stain.

Q. Mr. Fung, isn't it correct laboratory procedure to try and
collect as much of a stain as possible so that you can do DNA testing?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Irrelevant.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Do you recall testifying at the criminal
trial, page 22251, line 10, that you didn't think that stain was a
good candidate for DNA tests?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Irrelevant, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Did you think that was a good candidate for
DNA analysis, Mr. Fung?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Irrelevant.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Mr. Fung, are you aware of any photograph
after June 14, prior to August 26, that shows the blood on the console
in the position of 305 on the bottom?

A. Can you give those dates again?

Q. From June 14, when you collected part of it, until August 26,
when it was searched by Michele Kestler --

A. Additional photographs taken of that area?

Q. That shows stain 305 or 304, the way it appears here.

A. I'm not aware of any additional photographs that were taken
between that time.

Q. Now, did you take any -- have any photographs taken of the
Bronco after you were done, to show what you had left there?

A. No.

Q. Though this is Exhibit 239, can you tell us what this is, Mr.
Fung, what it appears to be?

A. That appears to be a shot of the Bronco with the door open on
the left side.

Q. And that's you holding a flashlight there, is it not?

A. Yes.

Q. And that was taken on what day?

A. June 14.

Q. Now, I think you said yesterday that you when you processed --
when you looked at the Bronco at the Rockingham location, you didn't
see any blood down around the door sill?

A. Didn't notice any.

Q. And you looked at the Bronco for possible blood on the outside
of it, didn't you?

A. At that time, I was directed mostly to that handle area.

Q. So you only looked at the little handle area because that's all
you were directed to?

A. There's other areas that needed attention at that time, and I
knew the Bronco was going to be impounded, so I didn't spend much time
with it.

Q. Let me show you 108.

This is a picture of the Bronco, with you standing at -- pointing at
the spot -- pointing at the door handle -- the spot on the door
handle, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Let me show you a little clearer --

MR. PETROCELLI: The Exhibit number?

MR. BLASIER: 108.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) There's no indication of any blood on the
Bronco around the door sill area, is there?

A. I wouldn't expect to see that, find an area of blood to be
depicted in this photograph.

Q. You don't see any blood in that photograph, do you, Mr. Fung?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Asked and answered.

THE COURT: The answer may remain.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) That became an issue, whether there was any
blood visible outside the Bronco door at the time of the preliminary
hearing, correct?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Irrelevant.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Were you sent out back to the Bronco during
the preliminary hearing by Marcia Clark to look to see whether there
was any blood visible from the outside of the Bronco, down around the
sill area, that you could see with the door closed?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Irrelevant.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Let me show you 1528.

Now, Mr. Fung, do you recall looking at that photograph during the
criminal trial and making those circles?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Irrelevant.

THE COURT: Overruled.

MR. LAMBERT: Beyond the scope.

THE WITNESS: Yes, I do.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) And that was a picture -- that was you
circling the blood stains that you had located in the door sill area
during the preliminary hearing, correct?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Irrelevant; beyond the scope.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: I believe I was circling areas that I believe the stains
were at, even though it was a poor picture and I was locating the --
where the items of blood should have been.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Okay. The original picture is better than
this laser copy, is it not? You can't actually see the spots, can you?

A. I don't think I could even see it at the criminal trial. But
later, a better photograph was found, and it was relatively in the
same locations.

Q. Okay. And you agree that these two circles, the one on the top
and the one at the far right, you cannot see that area with the door
of the Bronco closed?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Calls for conclusion; irrelevant.

THE COURT: Sustained. It's irrelevant.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) You did a presumptive test on some blood on
the Bronco in that area during the preliminary hearing, did you not?

A. Before -- Well, yeah, I guess it was during.

Q. You were sent out there by Marcia Clark, correct?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Irrelevant.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: I was, yes.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) And you never wrote a report about any of that
work that you did on that day, did you?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Irrelevant; beyond the scope.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: I did.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) When?

A. I wrote it on October 6, 1994.

Q. And you did that on what date?

You did the actual testing on what day?

A. July 6, 1994.

MR. LEONARD: May I assist Mr. Blasier?

THE COURT: Are we getting into a different area?

MR. LEONARD: We are.

THE COURT: All right. Take a ten-minute recess.

Ladies and gentlemen, don't talk about the case; don't form or express
any opinions.

(Recess taken at 10:58 a.m.)

(Jurors resume their respective seats.)

THE COURT: You may resume.

MR. BLASIER: Thank you, Your Honor.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Mr. Fung -- what number is this, Phil?

MR. P. BAKER: I'm looking right now.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Mr. Fung, can you see the board up there
entitled "Rockingham Biological Evidence?"

A. Yes.

Q. Now, when you went back to Rockingham, the second time about
what time did you get there.

A. We arrived back at Rockingham at approximatly 3:30.

Q. And at that time, you were responsible for collecting anything
of evidentiary value inside the house, correct?

A. I was there to collect evidence inside the residence within the
parameters of the search warrant.

Q. Okay. You're there to collect any physical evidence, anything
of evidentiary value that you could find, right?

A. Within the parameters of the search warrant.

MR. BLASIER: And can we look at -- the board is 208, Your Honor. And
I put on the Elmo what's been previously marked as 924 and 925. Maybe
we can show those together.

These are pictures that show the inside of Mr. Simpson's house with a
stairway that goes up to the upstairs bedroom and then the one on the
right is the hallway going back to the bedroom. Do you recognize
that?

(The instrument herein referred to as Picture of stairs at Rockingham
was marked for identification as Defendants' Exhibit No. 924.)

(The instrument herein referred to as Picture of Rockingham Hallway
was marked for identification as Defendants' Exhibit No. 925.)

THE WITNESS: Not particularly, no.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) You don't?

A. Not really.

Q. Do you remember it looking about like that?

A. Something, something like that.

Q. Did you conduct a careful examination of the entire area from
the bottom of the stairs back into the bedroom?

A. I did look, yes.

Q. And the carpeting that's on the stairway, and it goes back in
the hallway is relatively plush; is it not?

A. Relatively, yes.

Q. And it's much more plush than the carpeting that's in the
Bronco; isn't it?

A. I don't remember the relative plushness.

(Laughter.)

Q. Was -- there was no evidence of bloody shoe print drops of any
form whatsoever on the stairway going upstairs, correct?

A. Between which areas?

Q. The foyer and the upstairs hall.

A. No.

Q. That's correct; is it not, there was no evidence of any blood in
that area?

A. I didn't detect any.

Q. Nothing on the bannisters?

A. None detected.

Q. Nothing in the hallway at all going back to the master bedroom,
correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. Nothing on the walls, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. Nothing on the switch plates?

A. Correct.

Q. Nothing on the door knobs?

A. None detected.

Q. Now, when you got in the master bedroom, there was no indication
of any blood anywhere on the floor, correct?

A. I did not see any.

Q. On the bedding, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. And you looked in the bathroom as well, did you not?

A. In the master bathroom, yes.

Q. Did you look in the hamper there?

A. I did not personally look in the hamper. However, there were
detectives who had gone through that clothing.

Q. And there was -- there was nothing of any evidentiary value in
the hamper, correct?

A. They did not direct my attention to any of that, no.

Q. There were no bloody towels, no bloody clothes, anything like
that?

A. We did not find any.

Q. Now, the socks that are on the floor, you checked items of
evidence starting on the foyer area and going upstairs, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And we can tell from the number 12 that's the item number that
you assigned to the drop or drops in the foyer area, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And after you processed number 12, you came upstairs and
processed number 13, which is the socks?

A. I labeled 13.

Q. Labeled, okay. And 14 is a spot on the bathroom floor, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. Now, what do your records show in terms of the time that you
processed number 12?

A. Number 12 has the time of -- and I'm referring to my notes --
4:30 in the afternoon.

Q. You have that in your notes?

A. Well, on the evidence collection sheet, item number 12.

Q. Oh, I'm sorry. Item number 12, 4:30, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And item number 14 was at what time?

A. Item 14 was at 4:40.

Q. And you collected the -- or at least labeled the socks between
12 and 14, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. What time did you physically collect the socks?

A. The socks were collected within -- somewhere within that
timeframe there.

Q. And those socks appear to be completely out of place in that
room, didn't they?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Was there any other clothing on the floor in
that room at all?

A. Not on the floor, no.

Q. Now, on the bed area, there's what appears to be some straps
that appear to come from luggage; is that correct?

A. Well, there were some straps there. I wasn't sure if they were
from luggage or whether they were suspenders or anything like that. I
looked at them and I didn't see them as particularly interesting for
collection.

Q. Okay. And we have up on the television screen, exhibit 926. Do
you recognize that?

A. Yes.

(The instrument herein referred to as Evidence collection Sheet Items
1-16 was marked for identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 926.)

Q. That is your check list for the items that you collected at
Rockingham, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And if we can zoom in on 13 down there, that's the socks,
correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. Now, one of the purposes of these documents is to record the
precise location of items of evidentiary value, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Where -- what was the location of the socks according to that
document?

A. According to this document, eight feet north of the south wall
and four feet west of the east wall.

Q. I have a new exhibit. Could I have a number, please?

THE CLERK: 2136.

MR. BLASIER: 2136.

(The instrument herein referred to as Mr. Fung's notation; Re: socks
from Rockingham scene was marked for identification as Plaintiffs'
Exhibit No. 2136.)

(Plaintiff counsel review document handed to them by Mr. Blasier.)

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Let me show you first, in person, 2136. You
recognize that, don't you?

A. Yes.

Q. What is that?

A. That is a notation with the socks being at four feet north of
the south wall, and eight feet west of the east wall.

Q. That's a document that has the socks at a different location
from the document that's on the television screen?

A. Well, the numbers are transposed.

Q. Different locations, aren't they, Mr. Fung?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection, Your Honor. Asked and answered.

THE COURT: I don't think he answered that.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) They're at different locations on these two
documents, aren't they, Mr.'Fung?

A. The numbers are transposed. So if you were to go literally from
those notes, yeah, they would be in different position.

Q. Who wrote the document that's on the television screen which is
926?

A. That would be ciminalist Mazzola.

Q. And that was done at your direction, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And who wrote 2176?

A. That is also ciminalist Mazzola's handwriting.

Q. That was done at your direction as well, correct?

A. Correct.

Their --

Q. There's no question, Mr.'Fung.

A. Sorry.

Q. Let me show you page 4 of exhibit 1412. And ask you if you
recognize this.

A. Yes.

Q. And what is it?

A. That is the property report that I prepared after going over the
notes.

Q. And this records, again, the locations of items that you took
into evidence, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. What is the location for item number 14?

A. 14?

Q. Yes.

A. That would be six feet, 11 -- excuse me. Six feet south of the
north wall, four feet west of the east wall.

Q. Let me show you 2136 again. Tell me what the location is there
for item 14? Zoom in. It's under line 9, correct?

A. If you could move it over.

Q. Sure.

(Referring to TV screen.)

A. That says, I believe, six feet 11 south of the north wall and 8
feet -- I can't make that out.

Q. Zoom in, please.

(Indicating to TV screen.)

A. Eight feet eight west of the east wall.

Q. Tell me how it's described in 1412.

A. In this document it's six feet south. Six feet, 11 inches south
of the north wall and four feet west of the east wall.

Q. That's a completely different location than is seen on the
document on the TV screen?

A. Yes, it is.

Q. Mr. Fung, was the level of care that was used in preparing these
documents the same level of care that you used in preparing evidence
in this case.

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Argumentative.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Now, do you recall -- you can take that down,
Phil -- When you collected or prior to the time that you collected the
socks from the bedroom floor, seeing a videographer from LAPD?

A. I was aware that a video crew was there,

Q. And the video crew was not there to preserve the crime scene at
all. It was there to make certain that if anything was broken during
the course of the search warrant, LAPD didn't have to pay for it?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection.

MR. BLASIER: Let's rephrase it. The videotape person was there for
insurance purposes on behalf of LAPD, was he not?

MR. LAMBERT: Lack of foundation.

THE COURT: Lay a foundation.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) If you know. Do you know why he was there?

A. He was there for liability purposes.

Q. Okay. He wasn't there to help you document the crime scene, was
he?

A. No.

Q. Now, Mr. Fung, what time did you see him? Did you see him in the
bedroom?

A. I don't recall where exactly I saw him. I do know that his
presence was -- I was aware of his presence, though. I didn't keep
track of him.

Q. Were you aware of his presence in that room at 4:14 in the
afternoon?

A. Again, I didn't keep track of him.

Q. There were no socks on the floor at 4:14 in the afternoon, were
there?

A. It may have been collected earlier at 4:14. I, again, those
times are relative. They could go either way 10, 15 minutes.

Q. Are you saying now you might have collected the socks before you
collected the blood in the foyer?

A. Probably not, no.

Q. And you collected the blood in the foyer at 4:30, didn't you?

A. At around that time, yes.

Q. You couldn't have collected the socks earlier than 4:14, could
you?

A. Probably not, no.

Q. Now, when you collected, those are two different items, aren't
they? Two socks, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. When you checked them, you put them in the same bag, didn't you?

A. Yes.

Q. Is it an acceptable procedure to put two items of evidence in
the same bag?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Irrelevant.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Did you run out of bags, Mr.'Fung?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Argumentative.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: I did not.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Was your choice to -- it was your choice to
put them in the same bag?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, is it correct to say that you did not observe any blood on
those socks whatsoever when you collected them?

A. I did not look for blood on the sock at that point. I collected
them so that they could be analyzed for blood at a later time.

Q. When you were -- you were looking for items that might have
blood on them, weren't you, Mr. Fung?

A. I was.

Q. And you looked at the socks and you didn't see any blood, did
you?

A. I collected them so that they could be analyzed for blood later.

Q. So you didn't look at them at the scene?

A. Not with the level of care needed to be able to detect blood on
navy blue socks, no.

Q. Did you look at them to see if there was any blood on them, Mr.
Fung?

A. I didn't see any blood on them when I looked at them.

MR. BLASIER: Move to strike as nonresponsive. So you did look at them
--

THE WITNESS: I did look at the socks.

MR. BLASIER: -- For blood and didn't see any blood?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Asked and answered.

THE COURT: You may answer.

THE WITNESS: I did not see blood on the socks.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Okay. Now, there was also, you didn't see any
evidence of a -- of a lot of dirt on the socks either, did you?

A. Again, I did not look at the socks with the -- with a microscope
or a magnifying glass, so I did not see any soil on the socks.

Q. When you looked at them, when you were looking for whatever you
were looking at, there wasn't any obvious dirt on there, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. There was no line of dirt in an area where a shoe might meet
with a sock either, was there?

A. No.

Q. And there was no dirt on the -- on the carpeting underneath the
socks, correct?

A. I did not notice any.

Q. And there was no apparent blood stain on the carpeting under the
socks, was there?

A. I didn't notice any.

Q. Now, I want to ask you some questions about Mr. Simpson's
reference blood. At what time did you receive that?

A. That was received at 5:20 on June 13.

Q. And that was when Detective Vannatter brought it from the police
department downtown, out to Rockingham, correct?

A. I did receive the blood vial in the foyer at Rockingham.

Q. From Detective Vannatter who brought it from downtown, you
understood that, didn't you?

A. Yes.

Q. Did anyone call you in advance to say that they wanted to bring
you the blood vial out to the crime scene?

A. No.

Q. That's a horrible thing to do; isn't it, Mr.'Fung?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Argumentative, beyond the scope.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Is that a proper technique to bring reference
blood back to a crime scene?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Mr. Fung, you received this -- how was it
contained when you received it?

A. The vial was within a gray analyzed evidence envelope.

Q. Was it sealed?

A. I don't believe it was.

Q. Did you take the blood vial out of the envelope?

A. Not sure if I did. I did check to see if it was intact.

Q. Did you take -- do you know whether you took it out of the
envelope?

A. I don't recall if I did or not.

Q. There was a photographer named Wilson standing right about
there; wasn't there?

A. Yes.

Q. Do you remember that?

Where was Andrea Mazzola while you were doing that?

A. I don't know where she was at that point in time. I don't
recall.

Q. Now, you received the reference vial in the area of the foyer,
in the same area as where these blood drops were found, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Did you become aware at some later time there were more blood
drops found in that foyer area?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Irrelevant, beyond the scope.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: I'm aware that there were smaller dots that were present
that I did not collect of those larger -- of that larger area there.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) But you had seen them on the 13th when you
collected 12?

A. I didn't take notes of them.

Q. If you didn't see -- you didn't see them?

A. I may have saw them but I didn't collect the smaller dots. I
didn't because there were larger areas of blood there. I didn't look
for -- look at or notice the smaller ones.

Q. Does -- was Mr. Simpson's vial opened in that foyer area?

A. No, it was not.

Q. After you got it, what did you do with it?

A. I initialed the envelope and noted the time that it was
relinquished into my custody.

Q. What did you do with it then, Mr. Fung?

A. With the envelope?

Q. Yeah.

A. Well, from reconstruction in videotapes, I put it in a garbage
bag, a plastic garbage bag and gave it to Ms. Mazzola.

Q. Where did you get the garbage bag from?

A. I asked one of the detectives to find a bag or something for me
to bring out the evidence in 'cause I didn't want the media to see
what I was bringing out.

Q. You didn't want the media to see you were bringing evidence out
of the house?

A. What the evidence was.

Q. It was in an envelope by that point, wasn't it?

A. Sure.

Q. Why didn't you want the media to see you bringing an envelope
out of Mr. Simpson's house?

A. We try to -- or I try to bring evidence out in nondescript
packages so that the investigative process is not compromised.

Q. The investigative process is not compromised, so you put it in a
trash bag?

A. Well, it's pretty hard to see what's inside a trash bag, so
yeah.

Q. Now, you had been collecting blood drops that morning in the
driveway, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. You had cards all over the driveway for the blood drops,
correct?

A. Correct.

Q. You made no effort at all to conceal that evidence collection
from the media, did you?

A. I -- the media wasn't there early in the morning. I did not
consider that they would all be at the Rockingham location when I got
back.

Q. So the reason you didn't do that in secret was because there was
no media there in the morning?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Argumentative, irrelevant, beyond the scope.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Mr. Fung, what was it about Mr. Simpson's
reference vial that you concluded you needed to conceal it from the
media?

A. It's not so -- Well, at that point, there was just so much
coverage that the -- less the media knew, the better.

Q. So you did that intentionally, put it in a trash bag to take it
back to the lab to conceal it?

A. I usually place items of evidence in nondescript packaging.

Q. Did you have other envelopes with you at the time?

A. Not at that time.

Q. You had them in your truck?

A. They were in the truck.

Q. Now, you gave this trash bag to Andrea Mazzola, did you not?

A. Yes.

Q. You've seen pictures of her dragging it out of Rockingham?

A. Yes.

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Argumentative, "dragging."

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Pulling it out behind her?

A. Well, she's carrying it.

Q. Carrying it. You never told her was in it?

A. I didn't know her location when I received the vial. I didn't
think I had to. I thought she was in the relative vicinity of when I
accepted the vial of -- within the envelope. I thought she knew what
was in it.

Q. You had no conversation with her about the fact that you had
given her Mr. Simpson's reference vial in a trash bag to take out to
the crime scene truck?

A. That's --

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Irrelevant.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) When you collect blood your supposed to
refrigerate it as soon as possible, correct.

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Irrelevant, beyond the scope.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: It depends on the use for the blood.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) You're supposed to refrigerate it as soon as
possible, aren't you, Mr. Fung?

A. It's -- well, of a reference vial?

Q. Yes.

A. Is that what were talking about?

Q. Yes.

A. It's preferrable.

Q. When you got back to the lab that night with the vial still in
the trash bag, what did you do with it?

A. I kept it in the evidence processing room where it was a secure
location.

Q. You left it on the table in the trash bag, didn't you?

A. I did.

Q. There's a refrigerator right outside that room that is secure;
isn't there?

A. The stock room has a less -- has a lower level of security than
the evidence processing room. Also, I knew that there was
preservatives in the blood vial and it would probably be tested or
used soon so I did not see the urgent necessity for it to be
refrigerated at that point in time.

Q. So you left it in a trash bag on a counter at SID all night,
didn't you?

A. It was a clean trash bag and it was in a -- on a table at night,
yes.

Q. It had no markings on the trash bag at all, that would enable
anyone else who happened to come into that room, to have any idea
what's in that.

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Assumes facts, irrelevant.

THE COURT: It's irrelevant, but finish the question.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) I'll rephrase.

Was there any label at all on the trash bag that you used for Mr.
Simpson's blood?

A. Not on the trash bag itself, no.

MR. BLASIER: That's all I have.

THE COURT: Any redirect?

MR. LAMBERT: Little bit, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Okay.

REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. LAMBERT:

Q. Yesterday, Mr. Fung, you were asked by Mr. Blasier about a
positive presumptive blood test that you obtained on item No. 11 at
Rockingham. Do you remember that testimony, sir?

A. Yes, I do.

Q. I'd like to show you a photograph so you can identify what item
No. 11 is. Could you describe for the jury what item No. 11 is?

A. Item 11 is a red stain which was detected on this cord that
dangles down from somewhere high up on the building, down towards the
fence area.

Q. We'll need a new number for this. It's 2137.

THE CLERK: Thank you.

(The instrument herein referred to as a Photo containing item No. 11
was marked for identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 2137.)

Q. (BY MR. LAMBERT) This is in the portion of the house where you
found the glove; isn't it, Mr. Fung?

A. It is.

MR. BLASIER: Objection. Misstates the evidence. He didn't find the
glove. Fuhrman found the glove.

THE COURT: You may rephrase the question.

Q. Is it in the area where you collected the glove, Mr. Fung?

A. Yes, it is.

Q. Where was the glove located in relationship to this item No. 11?

A. If I could refer to this other board next to it --

Q. Okay.

A. -- It would make it easier. The wire I believe is in this area
here. And the glove was found approximately here. So it was west,
west of the glove and the air conditioner.

Q. In order to get from where the glove is, out to the front of the
house, do you have to go past this wire?

A. Yes.

Q. And was this wire hanging down in such a fashion that you would
have to move the wire out of the way in order to get past it?

A. Yes.

Q. And I'd like to show you some other presumptive blood tests that
you did that same day.

First, could you tell the jury what this photograph is? This -- going
to need a new number too. This will be 2138, if you will.

(The instrument herein referred to as photo of Mr. Fung swabbing
draing of shower was marked for identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit
No. 2138.)

Q. What does this photograph depict, Mr. Fung?

A. That photograph depicts me holding a cotton applicator in the
drain of the master shower.

Q. And what are you doing with the cotton applicator?

A. I'm doing a presumptive test for blood.

Q. Okay. Let's see the next photograph, please. There it is. 
This doesn't show-up too well on the screen, but what color is at the
end of your cotton swab there?

A. That is a pink color indicating the presence of blood.

Q. Okay. This would be 2139. And this is in the shower in the
master bathroom; is that correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. Let's now look at the next one, please.

THE COURT: Just a minute. Hold on a second. This is 2139.

MR. LAMBERT: Last one was.

THE COURT: What was 2138.

MR. PETROCELLI: The first photo.

MR. LAMBERT: We did two photos. 2138 was a far away and 2139 was the
cotton swab. This is 2140 and what does this depict, Mr.'Fung?

(The instrument herein referred to as photo of cotton swab was marked
for identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 2138.)

THE WITNESS: That depicts the master -- in the master bathroom,
there's a sink and I'm holding a cotton applicator next to that sink.

(The instrument herein referred to as Photo depicting Master bathroom
sink was marked for identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 2140.)

Q. (BY MR. LAMBERT) And what are you doing with the cotton
applicator?

A. I had just tested the drain, the drain area.

Q. Okay. That's 2140. Let's see 2141.

(The instrument herein referred to as photo of pink cotton applicator
indicating positive was marked for identification as Plaintiffs'
Exhibit No. 2141.)

Q. (BY MR. LAMBERT) Can you describe what we see in this picture?

A. In that photograph the cotton applicator is pink and I had just
performed a presumptive test for blood phenolphthalein and it was
positive.

Q. And it's that pink color that indicates positive for blood; is
that correct?

MR. BLASIER: Objection. That misstates the testimony. Doesn't show
positive for blood, it's not a positive test for blood.

THE COURT: Overruled. It's presumptive test for blood.

Q. (BY MR. LAMBERT) Is that right, sir?

A. It is a positive -- presumptive test for blood and it is
positive.

Q. Now, yesterday, Mr. Blasier asked you some questions about
whether some other kinds of substances could cause a false positive
reading when you do a phenolphthalein presumptive test. Do you
remember that?

A. Yes.

Q. Is there anything that criminalists can do to guard against a
false positive result in a phenolphthalein test?

A. Yes.

Q. By performing the phenolphthalein test in a two step fashion. 
The chemicals that are oxidizers can be eliminated at -- from being
false positives because the phenolphthalein will turn pink when those
chemicals are added immediately without the addition of hydrogen
peroxide.

What we look for is that the phenolphthalein turns pink right at the
addition of the hydrogen peroxide.

Q. So by using those precautions, you can guard against getting a
false positive result?

A. Yes.

Q. And did you use those precautions in this, this case at
Rockingham?

A. Correct.

Q. And did you get anything that appeared to you to be a false
positive result?

A. No.

MR. BLASIER: Objection. No foundation. He would know what it looked
like.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. LAMBERT) And I think I forgot to mention you also did
one of these tests for blood on that blood drop on the door of the
Bronco, the very first item that you collected?

A. Yes. A presumptive test for blood was done on the Bronco also.

Q. And what was the result of that test?

A. That was positive.

Q. And did you, again, guard against there being any false positive
results?

A. Yes.

Q. And let me ask you this, Mr. Fung: How many crime scenes have
you investigated?

MR. BLASIER: Objection. Irrelevant.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. LAMBERT) Let me ask you this, Mr. Fung: How many
phenolphthalein tests have you conducted?

MR. BLASIER: Objection. Irrelevant.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: I approximate that I have done in the neighborhood of
10,000.

Q. (BY MR. LAMBERT) Now, Mr. Blasier asked you some questions
about you using pencil to fill out some of your forms. Does the fact
that you used pencil rather than pen effect, in any way, the quality
of the evidence that you collect?

A. No.

Q. And Mr. Blasier asked you some questions about you erasing one
of the items, changing 18 to 17. Does that effect, in any way, the
evidence that you collected?

A. No.

Q. Did you do that simply to correct a clerical error?

A. Yes.

MR. BLASIER: Objection. Leading and also misstates the testimony.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. LAMBERT) What did you do that for, Mr. Fung?

A. The item of evidence, the blood vial was collected back at
Rockingham and the shoes, which were item 18, were collected back --
or at the laboratory and I wanted to keep those numbers sequential on
the property report to cut down on paperwork.

So I made, even though those item numbers were written down as
transposed by Ms. Mazzola, I wanted to make sure that they were kept
in the same chronological order.

Q. And Mr. Blasier also pointed out to you that apparently some of
the measurements got transposed from one document to another document
in regard to this item number 14, for example, here.

Does that change in any way, whether that blood is Mr. Simpson's
blood, if you change the location of the items on your report?

MR. BLASIER: Objection. Misstates the evidence.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: No, it does not.

Q. (BY MR. LAMBERT) Let's now take a look at the picture of the
Rockingham -- well, let me ask you this first: Mr. Blasier asked you
some questions yesterday in which he implied that the dog named Kato,
which was at the Bundy crime scene, was also at the Rockingham crime
scene when you were collecting evidence. Do you remember that, sir?

A. Yes, I do.

Q. Let me show you a picture here of the dog. No, the other one. 
Is this the dog that you saw at Rockingham, sir?

A. That appears to be a likeness of the dog I saw at Rockingham. 
It was a dark Chow.

Q. Dark Chow. Let me show you another picture.

(The instrument herein referred to as Photo of defendant's residence
with black dog, 7/31/96 was marked for identification as Plaintiffs'
Exhibit No. 1984.)

MR. LAMBERT: We need an exhibit number.

THE COURT: We've got some photographs.

MR. PETROCELLI: 1984 was the first photo.

MR. LAMBERT: This is number what? 28.

Q. (BY MR. LAMBERT) Did you see this dog at Rockingham that day,
sir?

(Indicating to Exhibit No. 28, depicting Akita.)

A. No, I did not.

MR. LAMBERT: Thank you. I have nothing further.

MR. BLASIER: Mr.'Fung, does it matter what kind of a dog --

MR. LAMBERT: Excuse me. Can I ask one or more questions, Your Honor?

THE COURT: Okay.

Q. (BY MR. LAMBERT) When you -- when you had that trash bag that
you put that vial of blood into to take out to the truck --

A. Yes.

Q. -- Did you have other items of evidence that you also had in
that trash bag to take out to the truck?

A. Yes.

Q. So it was not just the blood vial but all of those items of
evidence that you wanted to keep out of the eyes of the media?

A. Yes.

Q. Thank you.

THE COURT: You going to be long?

MR. BLASIER: Not too long. RECROSS EXAMINATION BY MR. BLASIER:

Q. You had trash from that bag too, didn't you, Mr. Fung?

A. No.

Q. You had the cards that you used to mark evidence items, didn't
you?

A. No, that's not trash.

Q. Those are not evidentiary items, are they?

A. That's correct.

Q. And they shouldn't be mixed in with evidence, should they?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Irrelevant.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Should they be mixed in with evidence?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Irrelevant.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Does it matter what kind of dog you have
wandering and your crime scene in terms of whether that can cause
problems for you in collecting evidence?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Irrelevant.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Is it important that your documentation be
accurate, Mr. Fung?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Irrelevant.

THE COURT: Sustained for purposes of this trial.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Did you use the same level of care in
collecting evidence as you did in documenting your collection of
evidence?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Argumentative, asked and answered.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. LAMBERT) The stain on the wire, that was never
confirmed to be blood, was it?

A. No.

Q. And did you use the stain -- the same technique to collect that
stain that you used on all the other stains?

A. Yes.

Q. Have you ever looked at those stains after you processed them?

A. You mean --

Q. Prior to item 11, did you ever look at the control slides for
item 11?

A. No.

Q. You ever compare it to what you consider to be the evidence
swatch?

A. I have, after the evidence was packaged, I have not seen the
items of evidence.

Q. Now, you took apart Mr. Simpson's sink traps in his bathroom,
didn't you?

A. Yes.

Q. There was no evidence of any blood in the sink traps, was there?

A. None was detected in the traps.

Q. And you did -- you tried to do testing in the traps, didn't you?

A. Yes.

Q. And you got no positive results, did you?

A. The sink traps were negative.

Q. And there was nothing in the bowl that appeared to be blood,
correct?

A. In the bowl?

Q. The bowl of the sink?

A. No. It was mainly in the -- where the drain is. There's that
lip around it. That was where it was.

Q. By the way, is it unusual to find blood in a sink trap?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection. Argumentative.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) In a bathroom?

MR. LAMBERT: Argumentative.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Tell me what sort of things give false
positives in scenes with the kind of testing that you did? Doesn't
copper plumbing do that sometimes?

A. Well, using the two step phenolphthalein test, and making sure
that it reacts immediately with the addition of hydrogen peroxide,
that can be eliminated.

Q. Tell me what sort of things in a sink give you false positives.

A. Same things that would give you false positives out of a sink.

Q. Cleaners, correct?

A. Not with the two step phenolphthalein test.

Q. Did you collect any stains in the sink area that was ever
confirmed to be blood?

A. No.

MR. BLASIER: Thank you, Mr. Fung.

MR. LAMBERT: Nothing further.

THE COURT: You're excused.

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, this witness is not excused. We'll be calling
him back.

THE COURT: Okay. 1:30, ladies and gentlemen. Don't talk about the
case, don't form or express any opinions.

A. Yes.

Q. Which unit?

A. I worked in the trace unit.

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Did you do that work at the lab, as well?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Let's get to some specific items of evidence.

I want to hand you a document that has been marked as Exhibit 464.

MR. GELBLUM: Steve, could you put that up on the Elmo.

(Mr. Foster complies.)

Is this cockeyed on purpose?

THE BAILIFF: It keeps the glare.

(Referring to people.)

THE COURT: If it bothers you, you can straighten it out.

MR. GELBLUM: The jurors' vision.

JURORS: Right. It needs to be straight, about so. She moved it over
before she sat down.

MR. GELBLUM: Say when.

JUROR: To the left.

That's far enough. Yeah. Thank you.

Q. (BY MR. GELBLUM) Do you recognize Exhibit 464, Ms. Brockbank?

A. Yes, I do.

Q. Is that something that I provided you with?

A. Yes, it is.

Q. Do you recognize that's essentially a reworking of a chart that
you testified about in the criminal trial?

MR. BLASIER: Objection. Leading, foundation.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. GELBLUM) You can answer.

A. Sorry.

Yes, it is.

Q. Essentially the same information that was on that chart?

A. Yes, it is.

Q. Have you had an opportunity to review that exhibit before
testifying today?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Can you briefly describe what the exhibit reflects?

A. The exhibit is a summary chart of various items of evidence,
listing item numbers, a description of the evidence, a date that trace
evidence was collected from each of those items, by whom, and a date
that that evidence was received by the FBI laboratory, and another
item number assigned by the FBI laboratory for that particular item.

Q. And does this -- does this chart summarize a number of
underlying documents?

A. Yes, it does.

Q. Are those documents, documents that are prepared in the --
prepared or used in the normal routine -- the normal course of
business of SID personnel?

A. Yes, they are.

Q. Okay. In the ordinary course of business at SID?

A. Yes.

Q. Have you compared the summary that's shown on 464 with the
underlying documents?

A. Yes, I have.

Q. And does it -- does 464 accurately summarize those documents?

A. Yes, it does.

Q. Your Honor, I would move 464 into evidence.

THE COURT: Received.

(The instrument herein referred to, previously marked as Plaintiffs'
Exhibit 464, was received in evidence.)

Q. (BY MR. GELBLUM) I want to go through some of the items on
Exhibit 464, and actually like to start with the second page.

When we get to the -- some of the items that you personally collected
--

MR. GELBLUM: Would you put the second page up.

(Indicating to TV screen.)

Q. (BY MR. GELBLUM) On June 21, 1994, Ms. Brockbank, did you
collect some hair and trace evidence from the glove that was found at
Mr. Simpson's home on Rockingham, which had been assigned LAPD item
number 9.

MR. BLASIER: Objection. Leading.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: Yes, I did.

Q. (BY MR. GELBLUM) What did you do with the hair and trace
evidence when you collected it?

A. When I collected it, I placed it into a paper bindle, and that
bindle went into a coin envelope.

Q. What is that paper bindle?

A. It's a piece of paper, basically folded in thirds in one
direction, kind of like this (indicating), and then again folded in
third in the other direction, to form a little pouch, if you will, to
hold evidence.

Q. Is that standard procedure at SID?

A. Yes, it is.

Q. Generally speaking, how did you go about collecting the hair and
trace evidence from the evidence items?

A. I began by examining the items and picking off anything that I
could see on each of those items, just visually examining, kind of
turning it against the light so I could see anything kind of sticking
out, picking those items off, placing them into the bindle.

And I lightly kind of scraped and shook each item over a piece of
white paper, and anything additional that fell off also went into the
bindle.

Q. Okay. And when you put the material into the bindle, did you
put any labeling on the bindle?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. What labeling?

A. A description of what type of evidence, hairs and fibers or
debris, that was removed from each item; the date, time, my initials,
item number DR number.

Q. Identifying information?

A. Yes.

Q. And then you said you put that bindle into a what?

A. A coin envelope. Just a small kind of manila envelope.

Q. Okay. Did you put any labeling on that coin envelope?

A. Yes; it was similarly labeled.

Q. Did you give the hair and trace evidence that you collected from
the Rockingham glove a new item number?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. What item number is that?

A. It was assigned item No. 110.

Q. Is that information that you just told us about reflected on
Exhibit 464?

A. Yes, it is.

MR. GELBLUM: Steve, would you go across the line for 110.

Could you go up and see the headings on the chart, as well.

Q. (BY MR. GELBLUM) That shows a description of what you
collected, generally speaking; is that right?

A. Yes, it is.

Q. Collection date includes June 21, right?

A. Yes, it does.

Q. And you collected it?

A. That's correct.

Q. Keep going across. We'll get to the last two columns a little
later. Now, did you also collect some additional hair and trace
evidence from the Rockingham glove on June 23?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. And what did you do with that evidence when you collected it?

A. That was placed into another paper bindle, and then placed into
the coin envelope.

Q. Was that a separate bindle and separate coin envelope from the
ones you prepared on June 21?

A. It was a separate bindle, but the same coin envelope, because it
was still part of the same item.

Q. Now, on June 21, did you also collect some hair and trace
evidence from a hat that was found in Mr. Simpson's Bronco which had
been given the item number 27?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. And what did you do with that hair and trace evidence?

A. Again, I placed it into a paper bindle, and that paper bindle
went into a coin envelope.

Q. Did you give that hair and trace evidence that you collected
from the hat a new number?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. What number was that?

A. I have No. 111.

Q. Was this information reflected on the chart?

A. Yes, it is.

Q. Again, on June 21, did you collect some hair and trace evidence
from the glove that was found at the Bundy crime scene which had been
given the item No. 37?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. And did you follow the same procedures for collecting and
packaging that hair and trace evidence as you've already described?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. And did you collect some additional evidence from that, the
Bundy glove, on June 23?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. By the way, did the trace evidence that you collected from the
Bundy glove include any debris other than hairs and fibers?

A. Yes, it did.

Q. What kind of debris?

A. Like dirt, maybe some plant material.

Q. So you found some dirt connected with the glove found at Bundy?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, on the same day, did you also collect some hair and trace
evidence from the blue knit cap that was found at the Bundy crime
scene that was -- had been the knit cap, had been labeled as item No.
38?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Did you collect hairs from different parts of that hat?

A. Yes.

Q. Did you collect hairs from both the -- or hair and trace
evidence from both the inside and the outside of the hat?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Did you put the materials from the inside and from the outside
in the same bindle or different bindles?

A. I put them in different bindles.

Q. And did you label those accordingly from where you had found the
evidence?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. And did you follow the same procedures in collecting and
packaging that material as you had, as you've already described, with
respect to the other material?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Did you give that hair and trace evidence from the Bundy glove a
new item number?

A. Yes.

Q. And what item number was that?

A. Item No. 113.

Q. Okay.

MR. GELBLUM: Did I misspeak? Did I say the glove or did I say the
cap?

MR. LEONARD: You said glove.

MR. GELBLUM: I meant to say cap.

Q. (BY MR. GELBLUM) So the record is clear, the hair and trace
evidence you collected from the cap, you labeled as item 113; is that
right?

A. That's correct.

Q. And the material from the glove was labeled as what number?

A. From the Bundy glove?

Q. Yes.

A. Was item No. 112.

Q. Now, when you collected the hair and trace evidence from the
blue knit cap that was found at Bundy, that you labeled as item 113,
did you also collect some debris from that cap?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. And what did that debris include?

A. Dirt and plant material.

Q. That's from the blue knit cap at Bundy?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, you said a little earlier that you also collected some hair
and trace evidence from some of the clothing that Ron Goldman was
found in; is that right?

A. Yes, that's correct.

Q. Okay.

MR. GELBLUM: Just so we can keep the numbers straight, I show you
another document. I believe it's part of Exhibit 1412, but I'm not
sure.

Just to be safe, let me give it a new number. I'm not sure it's from
1412.

MR. PETROCELLI: New exhibit number?

MR. GELBLUM: New exhibit and we're up to --

THE CLERK: 2142.

(The instrument herein referred to as Los Angeles Police Deparment
Property Report was marked for identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit
No. 2142.)

Q. You have in front of you, a document marked 2142. Can you tell
us what that is?

A. Yes. This is a police department property report.

Q. Was that a document that's issued and used in the ordinary
course of business at SID?

A. Yes, it is.

Q. For what purposes?

A. For booking various items of evidence into our property unit.

Q. Okay. There's two signatures at the bottom of Exhibit 2142. Do
you recognize either one of them?

A. Yes, I do.

Q. Whose are they?

A. The signature at the lower left-hand corner is that of Gregory
Matheson, who is an assistant lab director at our laboratory. And the
signature on the lower right-hand corner is that of Denise Lewis, who
is a laboratory technician at our laboratory.

Q. And was she a lab technician in June '94, as well?

A. Yes, she was.

MR. GELBLUM: I'd like to offer that in evidence, Your Honor, 1412.

MR. PETROCELLI: No.

MR. GELBLUM: 2142. I'm sorry.

THE COURT: Okay received.

(The instrument herein referred to, previously marked as Plaintiffs'
Exhibit 2142, was received in evidence.)

Q. Now, does Exhibit 2142 reflect how Ms. Lewis came into position
of the item listed here?

MR. BLASIER: Objection. No foundation.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. GELBLUM) Have you seen this document before?

A. Yes, I have.

Q. Have you seen documents similar to this that reflect the
delivery of evidence to SID from other offices?

A. Yes, I have.

Q. Okay. And does that include documents you've seen before that
reflect the delivery to SID of evidence from the coroner's office?

A. Yes.

Q. And does this document reflect such a delivery?

A. Yes, it does.

Q. And when does this document reflect that items were received at
SID from the coroner's office?

A. This document says that these items were received on June 24,
1994.

Q. From the coroner's office?

A. From the coroner's office.

Q. And does this document reflect Ms. Lewis entering various items
into the LAPD's numbering system?

MR. BLASIER: Objection. No foundation.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. GELBLUM) Is this document -- have you seen documents
similar to this, where items are received from the coroner's office to
SID, and assigned new item numbers?

MR. BLASIER: Objection. Irrelevant.

THE COURT: Why don't you just have her testify from the official
document?

MR. GELBLUM: This is the official document.

THE COURT: Have her testify from it, rather than having her draw
conclusions as to who did what.

MR. BLASIER: I'd object to having her testify from the document. The
document speaks for itself.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. GELBLUM) What does this document say as to what number
Ms. Lewis assigned to Ron's hair kit item -- I'm sorry -- hair kit,
Ron Goldman's hair kit?

A. His hair kit was given item number 73, according to this report.

Q. What is a hair kit?

A. That's something that's taken from a decedent by a coroner's
investigator or coroner's criminalist. What it includes are samples
of body hair from all over the body: Head hairs -- it generally
includes head hairs, eyelash, eyebrow hairs, arm hairs, sometimes leg
hairs.

If the victim is a male and has facial hair, it may include moustache
and beard hair, that sort of thing.

Q. Okay. And what item number was assigned to Ron's pants?

A. His pants were given item number 79.

Q. And his shirt?

A. His shirt was given item number 81.

MR. GELBLUM: And on the next page, Steve.

(Mr. Foster displays page on TV screen.)

Q. (BY MR. GELBLUM) What item number was given to Nicole's hair
kit?

A. That was given item number 83.

Q. And Nicole's dress?

A. Her dress was given number 86.

Q. Thank you.

MR. GELBLUM: Steve, would you put back up 464, the second page.

(Mr. Foster complies.)

Q. (BY MR. GELBLUM) Mrs. Brockbank, on July 27, 1994, did you
collect hair and trace evidence from the pants that Ron Goldman was
wearing when he was killed?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. And those pants we saw are labeled as item 79?

A. Yes.

Q. And what did you do with that hair and trace evidence when you
collected it, same things you did before?

A. Yes.

Q. And did you give the hair and trace evidence you got from those
pants a new item number?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. What item number?

A. Item No. 161.

Q. Okay. On the same day, did you collect hair and trace evidence
from Ron's shirt, which we've just seen labeled as item number 81?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. And did you use the same procedures in collecting that evidence
as you've already testified to with respect to the other items?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Did you give that hair and trace evidence from Ron's shirt a new
item number?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Which number?

A. Item No. 163.

Q. And again, on the same day, did you collect some hair and trace
evidence from -- I'm sorry.

On Ron's shirt, did you have two separate item numbers for hair and
trace evidence collected from Ron's shirt?

A. Yes.

Q. Why did you do that?

A. Actually, the second item number, item No. 165, that was hair
and trace removed from a bag which once contained his shirt. Those
items were inside this bag.

Q. And 163 was directly from the shirt?

A. Correct.

Q. Now, on the next day, July 28, did you collect some hair and
trace evidence from item number 91, which was a white towel that was
found in Mr. Simpson's Bronco?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. And did you collect that in the same manner as you previously
described?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. And did you give that hair and trace evidence from the white
towel a new item number?

A. Yes.

Q. And what item number was that?

A. Item No. 166.

Q. All right.

Again, on July 28, did you also collect some hair and trace evidence
from a plastic sheet that was found in Mr. Simpson's Bronco that had
been identified as item number 93?

A. Yes.

Q. And did you collect that in the same manner as you previously
testified?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. And did you give that hair and trace evidence from the plastic
sheet a new item number?

A. Yes.

Q. What number?

A. Item No. 1367.

Q. On August 2, Mrs. Brockbank, did you collect hair and trace
evidence from a shovel that was collected from Mr. Simpson's Bronco
that had been labeled as item number 92?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. And did you collect that in the same manner as you previously
testified to?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Did you give that another item number?

A. Yes.

Q. And what was that?

A. Item No. 169.

Q. And a couple days later, did you collect some hair and trace
material from item number 13 which were the socks that were collected
from Mr. Simpson's bedroom?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Did you collect that in the same manner as you previously
testified?

A. Yes.

Q. And package it in the same manner?

A. Yes.

Q. And did you give that hair and trace evidence a new item number?

A. Yes.

Q. Which was what?

A. Item number 221.

Q. Now, finally, in terms of your collection, on August 23, 1994,
did you collect some additional material from Ron Goldman's shirt,
item number 81?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. And what material was that?

A. It was more hair, fiber and dirt, blood, debris -- sorry.

Q. Did you give that a new item number?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Which was what?

A. 285.

Q. Did you collect that and package it in the same manner us
previously testified to?

A. Yes.

Q. Did you put that in a separate bindle from the other items you
collected from Goldman's shirt?

A. Actually I believe that debris I placed into a Petri dish, a
plastic Petri dish, which is just another type of container rather
than a paper bindle.

Q. And did you label the Petri dish?

A. Yes.

Q. In that similar manner to what you testified previously?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, back up on the first page of Exhibit 464, and over to the
first line of the second page, there's some references to items
collected by people other than you. You see that?

A. Yes, I do.

Q. Can you previously just walk us through what items were
collected, by the various people?

MR. BLASIER: Objection. No foundation.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. GELBLUM: She already testified she reviewed the underlying
documents and this accurately summarizes those documents.

THE COURT: Then use the underlying documents.

MR. GELBLUM: Well, let's just go through it in the same way we have.

MR. BLASIER: Objection.

THE COURT: Sustained. That's a list you created.

You can rely on business records from -- you rely on business records.
 Use the business records.

MR. GELBLUM: The summary section as well in 1500 of the Evidence
Code.

THE COURT: There's an objection.

MR. GELBLUM: The evidence -- the exhibit's been admitted in evidence,
correct, Your Honor?

THE COURT: Excuse me. The list has.

MR. GELBLUM: Okay.

THE COURT: There's been no testimony with regards to it. Without
some foundation, I'm not going to just let that list come in as proof
of the items contained therein. It's just a summary.

Q. (BY MR. GELBLUM) Mrs. Brockbank, did you review documents when
you were comparing this Exhibit 464 to the underlying documents that
reflect that Mr. Goldman's hair kit was collected by Claudia Ratcliffe
from the coroner's office on June 13, 1994.

MR. BLASIER: Objection.

THE COURT: Overruled. Yes, I did.

Q. And what document was that?

A. The actual hair kit envelope itself. I examined a photograph
and on the hair kit envelope. It has the date and a signature by
Claudia Ratcliffe, collected by --

MR. BLASIER: Objection. Move to strike. She did not examine the
item.

THE COURT: Excuse me.

MR. BLASIER: Move to strike her answer -- response of -- she didn't
identify the items.

THE COURT: Answer remains.

Q. (BY MR. GELBLUM) Did you review documents, Mrs. Brockbank, that
reflect that on August 15, 1994, Colin Yamauchi of SID collected a
sample from Ron Goldman's pants?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Okay.

And by the way, at a later point in time, was that sample given a new
item number other than 79?

A. Yes, it was.

Q. What item number was that?

A. I'd have to refer to my notes.

Q. Go ahead.

(Witness reviews documents.)

A. Item number 79 was given new item number 428.

Well, the sample that was removed from item 79 was given item number
428.

Q. Okay. Did you also review documents, Ms. Brockbank, that
reflected that on August 15, 1994 Mr. Yamauchi collected --

THE COURT: Wait a minute. Excuse me a second, please.

MR. GELBLUM: I'm sorry.

THE COURT: I don't know where you're going, but you're going from
this chart you got up on the TV screen, 79, to a bunch of other
numbers. I don't know where those other numbers are.

MR. GELBLUM: They're not on the chart, Your Honor.

THE COURT: I know.

MR. GELBLUM: I'm just having the witness testify to what that number
is, that new number is.

MR. BLASIER: Objection. No foundation.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. GALBLUM) Did you see -- have you seen documents,
business records of SID that reflect that new item number, Mrs.
Brockbank?

MR. BLASIER: I'm going to object. They can put the business records
in. They can't have a witness describe them when they're not here.

THE COURT: I agree.

MR. PETROCELLI: Your Honor, may we approach briefly, please?

THE COURT: All right.

(The following proceeding were held at bench:)

MR. GELBLUM: Your Honor, under the -- we're working both on the
business records exception, which she established, I believe, for
these summary voluminous documents exception which --

THE COURT: Fine.

MR. GELBLUM: Which allows --

THE COURT: You haven't shown me the business record. You just showed
me a summary.

MR. GELBLUM: The defense has all those business records as -- I have
had ample opportunity to review them.

THE COURT: The jury doesn't have it. I don't have it, there's
objection.

MR. PETROCELLI: Under 1509, if the records are available for
inspection, they don't need to be actually produced.

THE COURT: Mr. Petrocelli, you're going from a summary that has one
set of numbers, to some sort of record with another set of numbers on
which there's nothing on which we can verify her testimony.

MR. PETROCELLI: Forget this last thing. It's not on here. All she's
trying to do --

MR. GELBLUM: I won't give the new numbers.

MR. PETROCELLI: -- Is establish the chain of custody of the trace
evidence that was taken from the items and then send to the various
testing agencies like we did with Mr. Matheson. It's the identical
document, sort of document under 1509.

We don't have to produce the actual underlying records. They're
available for inspection and the defense has them. They haven't
objected. They want all those records introduced.

MR. GELBLUM: I won't --

MR. PETROCELLI: We're just establishing the chain.

THE COURT: Well, you're establishing a bunch of other numbers. The
jury's listening to a bunch of other numbers that have no relationship
to anything they've had.

MR. GELBLUM: I won't put those other numbers on. I'm just trying to
clarify.

THE COURT: If you're confusing me, you're confusing the jury.

MR. GELBLUM: I -- that's a very safe bet. I will stay away from the
new numbers.

MR. PETROCELLI: Thank you, Your Honor.

(The following proceedings were resumed in open court in the presence
of the jury:)

Q. (BY MR. GELBLUM) Ms. Brockbank, in reviewing Exhibit 464 and
comparing it to the underlying documents, did you review documents
that collect -- that Nicole's hair kit was collected on June 13, 1994,
and assigned a item number 83?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Okay. And did you also review documents that reflect that
Nicole's dress fabric sample was checked on August 15, 1994 from item
number 86?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. And did you also review documents that reflect that fibers from
the left rear of Mr. Simpson's Bronco were collected on August 11,
1994 and assigned item number 226?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. And similarly, did you review documents that reflect that on
August 11, 1994 fibers from the right front of Mr. Simpson's Bronco
were collected and assigned item number 228?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Did you also reflect documents that on the same day, August 11,
fibers were collected from the right rear of Mr. Simpson's Bronco and
assigned item number 230?

A. Yes.

Q. And again, did you review documents that reflect that on August
11, 1994, fibers were collected from the rear cargo area of Mr.
Simpson's Bronco and assigned item number 231?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. And then did you actually collect some hairs from an Akita on
November 30, 1994?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Where did you do that?

A. It was in the yard at the Rockingham location.

Q. Okay,

And what did that Akita look like? What color, do you recall?

A. I don't remember.

Q. Okay. And you assigned those hairs, item No. 366?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Okay. And then on the top of the next page, did you review
documents that reflected that on June 14, 1994, Dennis Fung collected
some hair and trace evidence from item number 9, the Rockingham glove?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. And that was assigned item number 19?

A. Yes.

Q. Let me back up to the first page again in the middle. Did you
collect some hair exemplars from Mr. Simpson on July 12, 1994?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Would you tell the jury please what a hair exemplar is?

A. A hair exemplar is a representative sample of hair from a
person, in this case, Mr. Simpson and it was just head hair. So a
representative sample is just hairs from all over the head, all areas
of the head.

So if I was collecting a sample of hair from myself, an exemplar, I
wouldn't take a bunch from the front right here 'cause there's a lot
of hairs in the back that are quite different than these ones right
here in the front. So I would collect samples from all different
areas of the head. That's what I did in this case.

Q. And where was Mr. Simpson when you made that collection?

A. He was outside of his cell at L.A. county jail.

Q. What did you do with Mr. Simpson's hair exemplar when you
collected it?

A. I placed it into a paper bindle and that went into an envelope.

Q. And did you label those in a manner you described before?

A. Yes.

Q. Did you package, by the way, package and label the hair exemplar
you took from the Akita in the same manner?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Did you also collect hair exemplars from various employees of
SID, the coroner's office and the LAPD?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Okay. Like to show you another document which has been marked
as Exhibit 484.

MR. BLASIER: May I see that, please?

May I have a copy, please?

MR. GELBLUM: I gave you a copy couple days ago.

THE COURT: What number?

MR. GELBLUM: 484. Your Honor, it's got a slightly different
description on the Exhibit list. This is a replacement for that same
information, different description.

Do you recognize that document, Mrs. Brockbank?

A. Yes, I do.

Q. Is that something that I provided to you?

A. Yes, it is.

Q. Is that like 464, a restatement in a different format of
information from a chart you testified about in a criminal trial?

A. Yes, it is.

Q. Can you briefly describe what is reflected on this document?

A. Yes. The far left column lists the LAPD item number that was
assigned to each item. Then there's a description of each item
listing the person whose hair exemplar corresponds to that item
number; followed by the collection date, which is the date I collected
hairs from that person.

Well, most of the collection was done by me. You'll see the
"collected by" and you'll see Brockbank on every space.

Exhibit 1, that was my own hair which was collected by someone else.

And then there's a "received by FBI" date and then the FBI item number
that was assigned to it.

Q. Okay. And you think -- I think you personally collected all
these exemplars, other than the one that was collected from you --

A. Yes.

Q. -- And obviously were present when that one was collected?

A. Yes, I was.

Q. Who -- was that collected from you?

A. That was collected by Ron Raquel, R-A-Q-U-E-L.

Q. Who is that?

A. He's a co-worker of mine.

Q. At SID?

A. Yes.

Q. And does Exhibit 484 accurately reflect the information
regarding your collection and Mr. Raquel's collection of hair
exemplars?

A. Yes.

MR. GELBLUM: Your Honor, I'd move 484 into evidence.

THE COURT: Received.

(The instrument herein referred to as a document entitled "Summary of
Hair Exemplars from LAPD and Coroner Personnel" was marked for
identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 484.)

(The instrument herein referred to as a document entitled "Summary of
Hair Exemplars from LAPD and Coroner Personnel" was received in
evidence as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 484.)

Q. (BY MR. GELBLUM) Some of the people on here, Ms. Brockbank, the
jury already heard about. Some are new names. If you could, I'd like
for you tell us who those people are?

A. Certainly.

Q. Who is Sandra Clairborne?

A. She is a forensic fingerprint specialist, works in our latent
prints unit.

Q. And Jean Braggs, B-R-A-G-G-S, who is that?

A. Yes. He's also a forensic print specialist.

Q. And Rolf, R-O-L-F, Rokahr, R-O-K-A-H-R who's that?

A. He's a photographer in SID.

Q. And going down a little further, Michele Kestler, K-E-S-T-L-E-R,
who is that?

A. She's is our lab director currently.

Q. What did she do in November, 1994?

A. What did she do?

Q. What was her job?

A. She was the Assitant Lab Director at this time.

Q. And in June, 1994?

A. She was also the assistant lab director then.

Q. And Colin Yamauchi, who is that?

A. He is a coworker of mine. He's a criminalist.

Q. And on the next page, who is Erin, E-R-I-N, Riley, R-I-L-E-Y?

A. She's also a criminalist.

Q. And Claudia Ratcliffe we mentioned previously, who is she?

A. She's a coroner's investigator.

Q. Lastly is Ed McGowan and just shows that he checked that hair a
couple months after the others. Why was that?

A. He had shaved his head. We had to wait for his hair to grow
out.

Q. Who is Mr. McGowan?

A. He's a police officer.

Q. Now -- thank you. On August 8, 1994, did you deliver certain
materials to the FBI in Washington DC?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. What did you deliver?

A. Would you like me to list the item numbers or --

Q. Sure, you have to refer to Exhibit 464.

A. Is that the first Exhibit you gave me?

Q. Yes.

A. Yes. There were a number of items, including item 73, Goldman's
hair kit; item 83, which is Nicole's hair kit; item 122, which is Mr.
Simpson's hair exemplar; item number 19, which was the hair and trace
from the Rockingham glove; item 110, which was the hair and hair trace
from -- Oops.

Did I just say -- no, I'm sorry. Item 110, which was also hair and
trace from the Rockingham glove; item 111, which is hair and trace
from item 27, the hat and the Bronco.

Q. Item 112, which was hair and trace from the Bundy glove; item
113, hair and trace from Bundy hat, the knit cap; item 161, which is
hair and trace from Mr. Goldman's pants which were item 79.

Item 163, which is hair and trace from Mr. Goldman's shirt, item 81.

No. 165, which is hair and trace from Mr. Goldman's shirt item 81. 
Actually, the bag that the shirt was in --

Item 166 which is hair and trace from the towel from the Bronco item
number 91.

Item 167, which was hair and trace from the plastic sheet from the
Bronco, item number 93.

And item 169, which was hair and trace from the glove from the Bronco,
item number 92 and finally item number 221, which was hair and trace
from item number 13, socks.

Q. Now, Mrs. Brockbank, to whom did you deliver those items at the
-- to the FBI?

A. I delivered those to Douglas Deedrick.

Q. Can you spell that for the reporter?

A. Douglas, D-O-U-G-L-A-S, I think, Deedrick, D-E-E-D-R-I-C-K.

Q. Who is Mr. Deedrick?

A. He's the head of the FBI laboratory hair and fiber unit.

Q. Did Mr. Deedrick assign new FBI item numbers to the items that
you delivered?

MR. BLASIER: Objection. No foundation.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. GELBLUM) Did you see Mr. Deedrick assign new FBI item
numbers for the items reflected on Exhibit 464?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Okay. And are those numbers reflected on Exhibit 464?

A. Yes, they are.

Q. Okay. Now, some of those items, particularly the ones on the
first page of the FBI items start with a K and on the next two pages
the item numbers start with a Q.

Do you know what the significance of those different designations is?

A. Yes, I do.

Q. What is that?

A. The K stands for known, K-N-O-W-N, and the Q stands for request
-- stands for question.

Q. What does that mean?

A. "Knowns" are items where you know the origin of those items. 
For instance, exemplar hair, where you know it came from a particular
person's head and the Q'd items are items in question. You're trying
to determine the possible source of those items.

Q. Okay.

A. By comparing them to the knowns.

Q. And were the other items of hair and trace evidence that are
listed on exhibits 464 and 484 subsequently delivered to the --
delivered to the FBI?

A. Yes, they were.

Q. And are the dates of those deliveries reflected on exhibits 464
and 484?

A. Yes, they are.

Q. And are the FBI numbers assigned to those items also reflected
on exhibits 464 and 484?

A. Yes, they are.

Q. Thank you. I have nothing further.

THE COURT: Ten-minute recess, ladies and gentlemen. Don't talk about
the case; don't form or express any opinions.

(Recess.)

(Jurors resume their respective seats.)

(The following proceedings were held in open court, in the presence of
the jury.)

THE COURT: Mr. Blasier.

MR. BLASIER: Thank you.

CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. BLASIER:

Q. Good afternoon, Mrs. Brockbank.

A. Good afternoon.

Q. Can you tell me how much time you've spent working with the
plaintiffs in preparing for your testimony today?

A. Altogether, possibly about four hours.

Q. And when did you spend that time?

A. When?

Q. Yes.

A. Let's see.

I met with Mr. Gelblum -- sorry -- someone last Friday for about two
hours, and I spoke with him on the phone for about an hour and a half.
And I met with him today for about a half-hour, twenty minutes,
something like that.

Q. So was last Friday the first contact you had with the plaintiffs
at all about this case?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, when were you given 464, this chart you have in front of
you?

I'm sorry. 464 is the first one you talked about.

A. This one?

Q. Correct.

When were you given that chart?

A. In this form, I think I was either given it yesterday or this
morning. I can't remember.

Q. Tell me when for -- let's say item number 73 at the top, when
did you compare the source documents for the information on this chart
now?

A. Before coming to court today.

Q. And where did you -- where did you get those source documents?

A. For that item, I looked at a photograph.

Q. What source -- did you look at any source documents?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. Vague.

Are we still talking about number 73 or the whole chart?

MR. BLASIER: I'm talking about 73 first.

THE WITNESS: For item 73, all I reviewed before coming here today was
just a photograph.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) You didn't look at any source documentation
about the time that that item was collected and how it was checked,
did you?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. Misstates the testimony.

THE COURT: I believe her testimony on direct was that it was a
photograph of an envelope, so that might be a document.

MR. BLASIER: Okay.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) What was it a photograph of?

A. It was a photograph of the hair kit envelope. And on that
envelope, it had the date and Ms. Ratcliffe's name, some other
information which I didn't really make note of.

Q. Did you evaluate any property report -- look at any property
reports and compare the information of property reports with anything
on this chart?

A. Many things, yes.

Q. And how long did it take you to look at all of the source
documents for this entire chart and verify that it's all accurate?

A. About four hours.

Q. And when did you spend that --

A. Over the weekend.

Q. Now, does this document represent all of the items that are
listed or were examined for hair and trace evidence before it was sent
to the FBI?

A. This document just reflects the collection dates of those items
before they were sent to the FBI lab.

Q. Were there other times when these items were examined for hair
and trace evidence that aren't reflected on this chart?

A. Yes.

Q. And do you know why those items were left, those dates and
times?

A. No.

Q. Now, you actually do a lot more than just take trace evidence
off of an evidence item and put it into a bindle; you do a lot of
analysis yourself?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. Vague point in time.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. You did quite a bit of analysis yourself, of hair and trace
evidence yourself?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. Beyond the scope.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. Plaintiffs tell you they weren't going to ask you about any work
you actually did other than collecting this?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. Hearsay.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) You examined quite a bit of this evidence for
hair and trace evidence other than what's reflected in this chart,
correct?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. Beyond the scope, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: Could you repeat that again? I'm sorry.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) So you, yourself, looked at a lot of these
items on this chart to do a hair and trace examination at times other
than are listed by the collection date, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay. Now, the carpet -- there was a piece of carpet that had
been cut out of the Bronco. Do you recall that?

A. Yes, I do.

Q. And that was -- a part of that cut-out had a lot of -- part of
it was a part of the rubber mat and part of it was part of the
carpeting, correct or was it all carpeting?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. Beyond the scope. It's not one of the items
listed on the chart.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Where did the fibers come from on the -- from
the carpets that you have on your chart?

A. Can you tell me what you're referring to?

Q. Sure. 228, 230, where did they come from?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. Vague, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Excuse me. Where did the fibers come from?

MR. BLASIER: Correct.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: They came from various areas in the Bronco.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Okay. So this chart doesn't reflect anything
that you did with the cut-out carpet sample that was taken out of the
Bronco; is that correct?

Is that accurate?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. Beyond the scope.

MR. BLASIER: How do we know?

THE COURT: Overruled.

You used this chart with her. Mr. Blasier has got a right to
cross-examine about this chart.

THE WITNESS: You're referring to item number?

Q. I think it was --

A. -- 33?

Q. I believe.

A. Could you say your question again? I'm sorry.

Q. Sure.

Item No. 33 was the piece of carpet that was cut out of the Bronco
from the floorboard area, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And that had a lot of carpet fibers attached to it, didn't it?

A. It was a piece of carpet, yes.

Q. Those carpet fibers are easily dislodged from that carpeting?

THE COURT: We'll move into that. I'll sustain the objection. You
may examine to the extent that Mr. Gelblum examined this witness with
regards to this chart, how she found it, how she put it in bindles,
all that stuff. But beyond that, I'm going to sustain the objection.

MR. GELBLUM: Good.

MR. BLASIER: Okay.

I'll bring her back.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Mrs. Brockbank, is there anything else at all
connected on this chart with anything you did with that piece of
carpet from the Bronco?

A. No.

Q. Is there any evidence item listed on this chart that was stored
in the same container, the same box as that piece of carpet from the
Bronco?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. Outside the scope, Your Honor.

THE COURT: I don't quite understand that question.

I'll sustain my own objection as to phrasing.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) That piece of carpet was kept in the same box
as the glove and the knit cap and the cap from the Bronco, wasn't it?

MR. GELBLUM: Outside the scope, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Does this chart reflect the same information
that was on the chart that you were asked about in the criminal trial?

A. Yes, it does.

Q. All of the information that was on the chart in the criminal
trial was on this chart?

A. I don't believe all of the information is, but some of the
information is.

Q. What was left off?

A. I'd have to look at them side by side to tell you. I can't
remember right off the top of my head.

Q. Item 33 was left off, correct?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. Relevance, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Now, at some point, Mrs. Brockbank, I think it
was decided that you would no longer do any analysis on items; they
would be sent to the FBI, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And what date was that?

A. I don't remember the date.

Can I refer to my notes, see if there's something in there?

Q. Sure. (Witness reviews documents.)

THE WITNESS: Could I get the question again?

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Sure.

There was a point in time when you were told to stop your analysis and
that everything was shipped to the FBI?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. Hearsay; beyond the scope.

THE COURT: Yes. Was there a time when such an event occurred.

Was there such a time?

THE WITNESS: I performed many different functions throughout this
case, and some of those continued after the time stuff went to the
FBI.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Okay. Was there a point in time that you were
told to stop your analysis on the items listed on this chart?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. Beyond the scope. We didn't talk about
analysis at all, Your Honor.

THE COURT: She sent it to the FBI. Mr. Blasier has a right to find
out when and how that decision was made.

THE WITNESS: I do not have a specific date of when I stopped doing
anything, but the evidence was taken to the FBI on August 8, so it was
sometime prior to that.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Okay. That was a decision made by the D.A.'s
office, right? It wasn't your decision?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. No foundation.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Do you know who made that decision?

A. No, I don't.

Q. It wasn't you, was it?

A. No.

Q. Looking at item 19 on the chart, which is the Rockingham glove
collection date, 6/14, is that the only hair and trace evidence that
you recovered from the Rockingham glove?

A. I didn't recover item 19 from the Rockingham glove.

Q. Is that the only hair and trace evidence that was recovered from
that item? Do you know?

A. No, it wasn't.

Q. How about 110? Does 110 reflect hair and trace from the
Rockingham gloves checked on two different dates?

Does that represent all item -- all hair and trace evidence that was
collected from the Rockingham glove?

A. To the best of my knowledge, I have item 110, and 19 included
all the hair and trace that were removed from the Rockingham glove.

Q. Describe to me the procedure that you used when you collect
trace evidence.

A. I start off by picking off any evidence that I can see and
placing that into a paper bindle. And when I'm through with that, then
I will gently scrape, kind of using my fingers, or just kind of shake
the item over a piece of paper, to see if anything additional falls
off. And that would also go into the bindle.

Q. Don't you take substantial precautions that the room that you're
working in has no air currents in it?

A. Our room doesn't have any swift air current in it.

Q. That's very important, because hair and trace evidence can
easily be dislodged from an item, can't it?

A. It depends on a lot of factors.

Q. It can get easily dislodged, can't it?

Some of the items you testified about, you found debris in the bags
that the item was contained in, rather than the item itself?

A. Correct.

Q. It's very easy for that type of material to come off those
items, particularly when they're in a bag, correct.

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. Vague, "very easy."

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: I don't know how easy it would be, but with an item in a
bag, there's an abrasive action of that item inside the bag which may
cause the item to become dislodged.

Q. And every time that you examine an item, you also dump out the
bag, as well, to see whether there's debris in the bag, don't you?

A. Every time I examine a new item? Is that what you mean?

Q. Yes.

A. Yes, I do. I look inside the bag and see if there's anything
stuck. I kind of reach in and take out anything additional that I
see.

Q. By the way, did you find a rose/beige carpet fiber on item No.
113, the knit cap?

A. I did not make a note of any type -- you know, specific types of
fibers I removed from any items. The hairs and fibers were removed
from several items, including that cap.

Q. And you did no analysis to look at that to see what was in it?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. Beyond the scope, Your Honor.

THE COURT: You may answer yes or no.

THE WITNESS: No.

Q. Exhibit 2142, which was the property report -- do you have that
in front of you -- from the coroner's office, the list of items from
the coroner's office?

A. Yes, I do.

Q. You have no personal knowledge about the manner in which the
items described on that report were collected, do you?

A. No; I didn't collect them.

Q. And you have no personal knowledge of who collected them,
correct?

A. Well, I wasn't there when they were collected. But on the
envelopes, I did see the name of the person that collected some of the
items, Claudia Ratcliffe.

Q. All right. And you have no knowledge about whether items on
this list were comingled at any time, do you, prior to the time they
got to your lab?

A. I have no personal knowledge because I wasn't there. I only
have personal knowledge of what I saw myself.

Q. Now, you're familiar with the procedure that's used to properly
preserve bloody clothing, are you not?

A. Yes.

Q. And when clothing that's bloody has been recovered from a crime
scene, is it always dried first before it's packaged? Right?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. Beyond the scope.

MR. BLASIER: Foundational, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Okay. Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) That's a proper way to do it, isn't it?

A. Yes, that's the proper way to do it.

Q. You don't wrap it up until it's dry, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And when you opened the package that had Mr. Goldman's shirt in
it that you referred to in the chart here, it was clear to you that
that had not been properly preserved; isn't that correct?

A. It had some mold growth on it, which indicated to me that it was
wet at some point, enough to cause mold to grow.

Q. Okay. That indicates it wasn't properly preserved by someone,
correct?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. Relevance, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Sustained. The mold growth may stay.

But you're asking her to draw a conclusion. I sustain that objection.

MR. BLASIER: I --

THE COURT: That's beyond the scope.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) The chart indicates that the item number 13,
the sock hair and trace was collected on August 4 of 1994, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Is that the first time that item was examined for hair and trace
evidence?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. Foundation.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: That was the first and only time I examined that item
for trace evidence.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Did those socks have a lot of dirt on them, or
small amount, or any?

A. I don't recall them being particularly dirty.

Q. And the Bundy glove wasn't particularly dirty, either, was it,
having dirt crusted on it or anything like that?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. Compound: "Particularly dirty" and then
"dirt crusted."

THE COURT: Overruled. I think the witness understands the question.

THE WITNESS: I don't recall at this point how dirty or nondirty it
was, to be honest.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Do you have any record you could look at to
make that determination?

A. No, I didn't make a note in any of my notes that reflect how
dirty or not dirty it was, either.

Q. Well, you said that you -- that you recovered some trace
evidence from that. What did you recover?

A. I believe mainly hairs and fibers.

Q. Okay. No dirt, that you recall?

A. Not that I recall, but there may have been some. I don't know.

Q. Well, do you keep a record of what it is that you collect from
something?

A. I usually write general descriptions, like hairs and fibers,
hairs, fiber and debris. Debris would include dirt, and I don't
believe I wrote anything about debris over on the Bundy glove.

Q. Okay.

THE COURT: Excuse me. That's the Bundy glove?

MR. BLASIER: Yes.

THE WITNESS: I could refer to my notes.

MR. BLASIER: Sure.

THE WITNESS: I'm sorry. For the Bundy glove, I did make a mention of
debris removed from that item.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) How much?

A. I didn't put any quantity down.

Q. You have any recollection of whether it was a large quantity or
a small quantity?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. Vague.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: I don't recall what quantity it was.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) By the way, trace evidence such as hair and
fiber can get moved from one place to another fairly easily, can it
not?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. Beyond the scope; calls for speculation.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Do you know whether there was ever a survey
done of the Bundy area that determined how common fibers from Mr.
Simpson's Bronco might have been dragged from there by his kids, by a
dog, by any other mechanism?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. BLASIER: That's all I had.

REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. GELBLUM:

Q. One question, Mrs. Brockbank.

You said in collecting the evidence, one of the things you do is use
your fingers to get hair and trace evidence off the items of evidence;
is that right?

A. Yes.

Q. Do you wear gloves when you do that?

A. Yes, always.

MR. GELBLUM: Thank you. Nothing further.

MR. BLASIER: Subject to recall.

THE COURT: Okay. You're excused, subject to recall.

THE WITNESS: Thank you.

THE COURT: Call your next witness.

MR. KELLY: If we could have one moment, Your Honor.

THE COURT: You may.

MR. KELLY: Your Honor, at this time, it will be a videotape
deposition of an out-of-state witness of Brenda Vernich.

THE COURT: Okay.

MR. BLASIER: Your Honor, I have one further question for Mrs.
Brockbank. May I have her back for one quick question?

MR. KELLY: You're not going to recall her?

MR. BLASIER: Yeah, we'll recall her.

RECROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. BLASIER:

Q. Mrs. Brockbank, with respect to the knit cap on the chart, was
that sent to the FBI, the bindles that you made?

A. The bindles that I made and the cap itself.

MR. BLASIER: All right; thank you. That's all.

MR. GELBLUM: Nothing further.

THE COURT: Okay. Thank you.

THE COURT: You may proceed.

Who is this going to be?

MR. PETROCELLI: Brenda Vernich, Your Honor.

MR. LEONARD: Your Honor, at this deposition, Mr. Kelly was asking the
questions; I was also asking questions; and I believe, just for the
benefit of the Court, there was a third attorney I think who may have
asserted an objection. I think that was someone representing the
witness.

MR. KELLY: Borger.

MR. LEONARD: So it's clear to the jury who the parties were.

THE COURT: Who was that person?

MR. LEONARD: There was an attorney representing the witness.

MR. KELLY: Mr. Borger, B-O-R-G-E-R, who was there on behalf of the
witness testifying, Your Honor.

THE COURT: All right.

THE COURT: How long is it?

MR. KELLY: About 45, 50 minutes, Judge.

THE COURT: Huh?

MR. KELLY: 45 minutes.

THE COURT: 45 minutes? Okay.

MR. KELLY: I'm sorry; 53 minutes full play time, Judge.

THE COURT: Jury ready for 53 minutes?

(Videotape starts to play.)

THE COURT: Can you stop that for a second.

Counsel have an agreement with the record that -- whether or not you
want the reporter to take this?

MR. KELLY: I don't think it's necessary.

MR. LEONARD: I don't think it's necessary.

MR. KELLY: As long as we agree that the transcript of the deposition
can be used, if necessary, in the future for evidence, sure.

MR. PETROCELLI: We have an agreement that all the objections can be
deemed overruled.

MR. LEONARD: In every videotape?

MR. PETROCELLI: No, no. In this one.

(The videotaped deposition of Brenda Vernich, taken on June 18, 1996,
was played in open court for the Court and the jury.)

(Pause in tape playing.)

THE COURT: How much longer is this?

MR. KELLY: Five minutes, six minutes.

THE COURT: Five more minutes. All right.

(Videotape resumed playing.)

MR. GELBLUM: Your Honor, we wanted to in court, convert deposition
exhibit numbers into trial exhibit numbers.

THE COURT: Okay.

MR. GELBLUM: Deposition Exhibits 1-A and 1-B are photographs of the
Rockingham glove. That glove is already in evidence as Exhibit 204
here.

Deposition Exhibits 2-A and 2-B are photographs of the Bundy glove,
which is already in evidence as Exhibit 129.

Deposition Exhibit 3 is our exhibit here, 1784, which is a new one.

(The instrument herein referred to as a Printout was marked for
identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 1784.)

MR. GELBLUM: Deposition Exhibit 4 is a Trial Exhibit 389.

(The instrument herein referred to as Receipt from Bloomingdale's was
marked for identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 389.)

MR. GELBLUM: Deposition Exhibit 5 is Trial Exhibit 390.

(The instrument herein referred to as Blow-up of document entitled
'Bloomingdale's Glove Purchase' was marked for identification as
Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 390.)

MR. GELBLUM: Deposition Exhibit 6, we'll need a new number, which is
-- which would be 2143.

(The instrument herein referred to as Copy of check digit calculations
was marked for identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 2143.)

MR. GELBLUM: Deposition Exhibit 6-B would be 2144.

(The instrument herein referred to as Copy of check digit calculations
was marked for identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 2144.)

MR. GELBLUM: Deposition Exhibit 6-C would be 2145.

(The instrument herein referred to as Copy of printout was marked for
identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 2145.)

MR. GELBLUM: And we would move all those into evidence.

And I would also like to quickly put a couple up on the Elmo, so the
jury can see them more clearly from that. Okay?

THE COURT: Okay.

(The instrument previously marked as Plaintiffs' Exhibit 389 was
received in evidence.)

(The instrument previously marked as Plaintiffs' Exhibit 390 was
received in evidence.)

(The instrument previously marked as Plaintiffs' Exhibit 1784 was
received in evidence.)

(The instrument previously marked as Plaintiffs' Exhibit 2143 was
received in evidence.)

(The instrument previously marked as Plaintiffs' Exhibit 2144 was
received in evidence.)

(The instrument previously marked as Plaintiffs' Exhibit 2145 was
received in evidence.)

MR. BAKER: I'm going to object to this, Your Honor. We weren't able
to pass charts.

THE COURT: Excuse me?

MR. BAKER: I'm going to object to this. We weren't able to pass
charts.

THE COURT: What were you going to do?

MR. GELBLUM: Put a couple exhibits up on the Elmo, on the screen, so
the jury can see them.

THE COURT: All right; it's not passing charts. Put them on the Elmo.

MR. GELBLUM: This one is exhibit 389, Trial Exhibit 389. That's the
receipt.

(Exhibit 389 displayed on Elmo.)

MR. GELBLUM: Next one is Exhibit 390.

There you go.

(Exhibit 390 displayed on Elmo.)

MR. GELBLUM: Can you focus on the signature there.

Next is Deposition Exhibit 6, which is 2143.

That's it, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Um-hum.

MR. GELBLUM: Again, we move those into evidence.

THE COURT: Proceed.

MR. GELBLUM: Thank you.

MR. PETROCELLI: Your Honor, we, at this point, would like to call our
next witness, who is on a plane from New York. He'll be here this
evening.

This may be a good time; otherwise, we can proceed to read in some
other criminalist's trial testimony from some other photographs. We
would prefer to wait until the morning, but it's up to you.

THE COURT: Jurors, you get a chance to vote yet today?

JURORS: No.

THE COURT: Well, jury, hopefully, you can make it to the polls by the
time it's closed.

Again, don't talk about the case; don't form or express any opinions;
don't let anybody talk to you about it; don't watch anything on TV,
newspaper, or on the radio.

Okay. Thank you.

(At 4:10 P.M., an adjournment was taken until Wednesday, November 6,
at 8:30 A.M.)

the cause now pending before this court shall be the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

THE WITNESS: I do.

THE CLERK: Please be seated.

THE COURT: Out of curiosity, how come this name isn't on the list you
gave me?

MR. PETROCELLI: Should have been.

THE COURT: I've been provided.

MR. GELBLUM: It might be lower down on the list other than first of
these of this group of witnesses. He's the only one we have live. I
thought we'd get him in and out quickly for his convenience.

THE COURT: I'd appreciate it if you'd give me an updated list that is
accurate.

THE CLERK: Sir, if you would, please state and spell your name for the
record.

THE WITNESS: Mike Romano, M-I-K-E, R-O-M-A-N-O.

Back it up a little bit, Steve.

(Mr. Foster adjusts Elmo.)

(The instrument herein referred to as a Photograph of Mr. Simpson with

Romano on January 15, 1994, previously marked as Plaintiffs' Exhibit
660, was received in evidence.)

MR. GELBLUM: Nothing further.

THE COURT: Cross?

MR. BLASIER: Mr. Romano --

Leave it on, please.

CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. BAKER:

Q. Mr. Romano, this was January 15, 1994?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. It was how cold that day in Buffalo, New York?

A. It was thirty-plus below zero.

Q. And did you know if Mr. Simpson had any hand warmers in the glove?

A. No, sir, I didn't.

Q. How much did you sell the photo for?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. Relevance.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Do you normally sell photos of Mr. Simpson to the
National Enquirer, Mr. Romano?

A. No, I don't.

Q. This was a one-time shot because it was Mr. Simpson and it was
after he was charged with murder?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. Argumentative.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: Repeat the question, please.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) It was a one-time shot after Mr. Simpson was charged
with murder, correct?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And how much did you get for the photo?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. Relevance.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) How much do you usually get for a photo, Mr. Romano?

A. It depends on the photo.

Q. Did you get more for this photo than any other photo of Mr.
Simpson?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. Relevance.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. BAKER: On what basis?

THE COURT: It's not relevant.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, did you try to market that photo before you
sold it?

A. No, sir.

Q. Did you analyze this photo before you sold it?

I mean, did you take a good look at it, Mr. Romano?

A. What do you mean by, did I take a good look?

Q. Did you -- for example, did Mr. Simpson's fingers go to the end of
the gloves in that glove (sic)?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. Calls for conclusion.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Did you make a determination as to whether or not
that glove was a tight-fitting glove on Mr. Simpson?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. Calls for conclusion. The photo speaks for
itself.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You made no -- well, did you ever even look at the
picture before you sold it?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. Okay.

And when did you sell it?

A. I think it was July or August of '95, not positive.

Q. After the criminal trial was ongoing, sir?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. Okay.

MR. BAKER: Thanks.

I don't have anything further.

MR. GELBLUM: Nothing, Your Honor.

THE COURT: You may step down.

MR. GELBLUM: Your Honor, next we have a series of four people, also
who are photographers who took pictures of Mr. Simpson. All of them
are unavailable, and all of them, we'd like to read in their criminal
trial testimony.

MR. BAKER: I'd object to the reading of -- there's been no showing of
unavailability. There has been no showing of unavailability of Stewart
West.

MR. GELBLUM: Your Honor, he lives in the Oakland area. And 20 -- 2025,
we can use his deposition if he's more than 150 flight miles from
here. It's trial testimony.

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, they subpoenaed him and they have served him,
and he should be here to be examined.

I think that the subpoena power is in effect throughout the state.

THE COURT: What is the code section we referred to earlier with
regards to distances?

MR. GELBLUM: I'm sorry, Your Honor; I referred to 2025, which is for
depositions, Your Honor. 2025(u), I believe it is.

THE COURT: Not if this witness has been subpoenaed.

MR. GELBLUM: We did send him a subpoena.

THE COURT: Excuse me?

MR. GELBLUM: We did send him a subpoena.

THE COURT: Did you send him or serve him?

MR. GELBLUM: We sent him a subpoena. We contacted him by phone. He
agreed to accept service; we sent it by mail, and we haven't heard
back.

THE COURT: Excuse me?

MR. GELBLUM: We sent him -- we mailed him, after he agreed to accept
the subpoena by mail, and we have not heard back from him since.

MR. BAKER: There's a proof of service, Your Honor? That doesn't look
like a proof of service to me.

THE COURT: All right. With regards to all of the other named persons
in the declaration, I'll allow the deposition.

You may offer me some points and authorities as to whether or not this
witness should be ordered to appear by body attachment or otherwise.

MR. GELBLUM: Very good. Thank you, Your Honor.

We'd like to do it similarly as we did before, with reading of the
testimony.

I'd like to have my colleague, Yvette Molinaro, take the stand.

THE COURT: You may.

(Ms. Molinaro assumed the witness stand and reads the answers from the
deposition of Mark Krueger.)

(Mr. Gelblum reads the questions and narrative portions of the
deposition of Mark Krueger.)

(Criminal exhibit numbers have been replaced with the corresponding
civil case exhibit numbers by the readers.)

MR. GELBLUM: Your Honor, we would like to start with the witness Mark
Krueger. Again, these are all witnesses who testified under oath at
the criminal trial.

(The instrument herein referred to as a video of O.J. Simpson giving

the first half scores, stats, overall commentary on the first half of
the game.

"Q. When you say "the game," ... (sic) what game are you referring to?

"A. That was the play-off game with the Bengals versus the Oilers."

MR. GELBLUM: One second, please. Stop it there. (Reading:)

THE COURT: Received.

(The instrument herein referred to as a video of O.J. Simpson giving
commentary was received in evidence as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 654.)

MR. P. BAKER: (Reading:)

"Q. Mr. Renken, good afternoon.

"A. Good afternoon, sir.

"Q. January '91 in Cincinnati, that's a pretty cold time of year
there, isn't it?

"A. Yes, it is.

"Q. And at this game, was it very cold?

"A. It was cold, rainy, moist.

"Q. It's not unusual -- I take it there are a lot of other people in
the stadium with gloves?

"A. I imagine.

"Q. Brown gloves?

"A. All different kinds of gloves.

"Q. It's not particularly unusual to have brown gloves in the cold in
winter?

"A. I assume.

"Q. In fact, did you notice in the video that everybody that was
walking around in the background behind Mr. Simpson was also wearing
gloves?

"A. I didn't really pay that much attention, but I assume in that
climate of weather, individuals wear gloves of any nature.

"Q. Now, just how cold was it that particular day?

"A. It could have been in the 20's, early 30's.

"Q. Did you at any time, get close enough to Mr. Simpson to determine
whether or not he had a heat pack in the palm of his hand -- in the
palm of his gloves?

"A. No, I couldn't tell.

"Q. You know what I mean by heat pack?

"A. Yes. I'm familiar.

"Q. Have you seen those used at football games to keep your hands
warm?

"A. Sort of.

"Q. Now, you said you notified the prosecution that you had pictures,
when, for the first time.

"MR. GELBLUM: Objection. Irrelevant.

"THE COURT: Overruled.

"THE WITNESS: Do I need to answer that?

"Q. Yeah.

"A. It was June, around 26th.

"Q. June 26?

"A. June around the 26th."

MR. GELBLUM: Line 24, I think.

(Ms. Molinaro continues reading:)

"A. Around June 26th, Jack Webster, former employee of Euro photo,
sent out a 20 by 30 poster print.

"Q. ... (sic) I think you indicated that some of those pictures are at
the beginning of the game and some are at the end of the game. Is that
what you indicated?

""A. Half time and at the end of the game, right.

"Q. Do you have any from the beginning?

"A. No, I don't.

"Q. All right. Now, the ones up here, which one is from half time and
which one is at the end of the game?

"A. The ones from half time, sir, are the horizontal, him holding the
blue umbrella.

"Q. All right. The first one of your pictures on the left?

"A. Yes."

"Q. And the one from after the game is the one on the right?

"A. Yes."

(Photos are displayed.)

"Q. ... (sic) was it raining during this whole game?

"A. Pretty much.

"Q. Did Mr. Simpson have an umbrella most of the time when he wasn't
on camera?

"A. There were times I remember seeing him out without it in the
runway area, but then, when they did the interviews, except for the
postgame, there was no umbrella used. But the half time there was.

"Q. Okay. Now, you notice in the picture that you indicated is from
the half time -- you can come down here and look at it a little more
carefully if you'd like -- around the wrist area of the gloves, they
appear to be bunched up like there's extra leather.

MR. GELBLUM: Objection."

MR. GALBLUM: Calls for conclusion.

MR. BAKER: Is that objection in the transcript?

MR. GELBLUM: No.

MR. BAKER: Then I object to his objection.

MR. GELBLUM: You can make new objections.

MR. BAKER: I don't think so. Not when they offer the deposition or the
prior -- Prior testimony. They can't offer an objection to it.

MR. GELBLUM: I didn't offer this portion, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, may I be heard on that?

THE COURT: You may.

MR. BAKER: Thank you.

(The following proceedings were held at the bench:)

MR. BAKER: Objection was first of all overruled in the criminal court.
Second of all, he asked this witness for exactly the same conclusions.
He's asked him about now. He asked about rain drops. He asked this
witness through the deposition, or the trial transcript, rather, to
make the very same conclusions that we're asking this witness to make.

And hence, there's no basis that this witness doesn't have any
foundation for -- plus when they offer the prior trial transcript,
it's my understanding that they can't object when it hasn't been
objected to. In this case, it's been overruled.

MR. GELBLUM: We can offer new objections. from anything. I don't know
of anything at all that prevents us from doing that. It's evidentiary
issues.

Secondly, we did not ask for this kind of conclusion about "the glove
was bunched up."

Thirdly, they could have objected. Just because they didn't object,
doesn't mean we can't object and the objection would be improper.

THE COURT: Well, you cite me the code section.

MR. GELBLUM: Which code section?

THE COURT: Cite me a code section.

MR. GELBLUM: I'm not aware of a code section. I'm not aware of code
section.

THE COURT: You're not aware of a code section dealing with the use of
depositions?

MR. GELBLUM: This is not deposition. This is prior testimony from the
criminal case, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Why are you calling it a deposition?

MR. GELBLUM: I wasn't, Your Honor. This is prior -- I thought I made
it clear. This is the testimony. I said to the jury, this is testimony
offered at the criminal trial.

MR. PETROCELLI: 1291 of the evidence code.

MR. GELBLUM: That's prior testimony. I apologize if I said something
to mislead you.

THE COURT: I think this testimony is being offered under 1291 of the
evidence code.

MR. GELBLUM: Yes, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Okay.

And 1291 says, subdivision B says the admissibility of former
testimony under the section is subject to the same limitations and
objections as though the declarant were testifying at the hearing,
except that former testimony offered under this section is not subject
to 1) objections, 2) the form of the question, which was not made at
the time the former testimony was given. And objections with regards
to competency.

MR. GELBLUM: This objection was made.

MR. BAKER: It was not. The objection was made, I think, from -- you
want to look at it?

MR. GELBLUM: It wasn't the form. It was relevance.

MR. BAKER: "Photograph speaks for itself," and I think under the --
this is not an objection that can be well taken.

MR. PETROCELLI: The objection was as to form.

THE COURT: Wait a minute. Let me read it. I can't chew gum and walk at
the same time.

(There was a pause in the proceedings to allow the Court to read the
testimony.)

MR. GELBLUM: I think --

THE COURT: Will you stop it. Let me read.

(Pause in the proceedings.)

THE COURT: After looking at the rest of the testimony, what you're
arguing about, I don't know.

I'm going to overrule. There's nothing of consequence that follows.
Overruled.

MR. GELBLUM: I have an extra set of the testimony. Would you like --

THE COURT: Not really. Okay.

MR. P. BAKER: I'm going to read the question back. (Reading:)

Now, you notice in the picture that you've indicated is from the half
time -- you can come down here and look at it a little more carefully,
if you'd like to -- around the wrist area of the gloves, they appear
to be bunched up like there's extra leather."

THE COURT REPORTER: Excuse me can you tell me what number that is, the
board, for the record?

(Mr. P. Baker displays Exhibit No. 646.)

MR. P. BAKER: (Reading:)

"Q. Did you notice that?

"A. Sure.

"Q. And that's consistent with what you saw that day?

"A. Well, I wasn't looking at his gloves. I wasn't looking at how they
were bound up. I was just shooting the ... (sic) I was not so much
shooting the gloves. I was shooting the individual at the time.

"Q. Now, take a look at the one from the post game. Do you see that
it's bunched up around the wrist area, there's some extra leather?"

MR. P. BAKER: 606 is displayed. 606 -- 641. 641 is actually displayed.

they appear to be consistent with the ones you've just talked about on
the board?

"A. Yes, they are, sir.

"Q. Okay. And those are all consistent with what you've told us about?

"A. Yes.

"Q. Now, I think you indicated that the video was -- the first part of
the video was half time?

"A. Yes.

"Q. About 2:45 I think you said?

"A. About that time."

MR. P. BAKER: Okay. Could we put the video up at frame 544?

(Video at frame 544 displayed.)

MR. P. BAKER: (Reading:)

"Q. See the time on that tape Mr. Renken?

"A. Yes, sir.

"Q. That's not half time, is it?

"A. That's not half time?

"Q. That's the beginning of the game, isn't it, before the game?

"A. ... (sic) Could be. It's -- Uh, oh, I see. Okay. The five -- I'm
sorry. I didn't understand what -- the 544. Okay. That's the actual
time of footage, right?

"Q. You're the one that identified the videotape. You tell me.

"A. That's correct.

"Q. What?

"A. ... (sic) That was -- that was quite awhile.

"Q. The video indicates it was 12:03, doesn't it?

"A. Excuse me?

"Q. The video indicates 12:03, doesn't it?

"A. Yes.

"Q. And that's the pre-game, isn't it?

"A. Oh, okay? Excuse me. That was the pre-game interview."

(Continues reading as follows:)

"Q. Does the video here, the right hand area, the wrist, look the same
as your pictures?

"A. Yes, they do.

MR. P. BAKER: "That's all I have."

MR. GELBLUM: Nothing further.

MR. P. BAKER: 45044. (Reading:)

"Q. Good afternoon, Mr. Schott?

"A. Good afternoon.

"Q. How are you doing?

"A. Fine, thank you.

"Q. November of '93 is when these pictures were taken, correct?

"A. Correct.

"Q. In Buffalo?

"A. In Buffalo.

"Q. Do you live in Buffalo?

"A. I live in Orchard Park.

"Q. Is that near Buffalo?

"A. It's near Buffalo.

"Q. November in the Buffalo area generally isn't cool. It's generally
very, very cold. Was this an unusually warm day or a cold day?

"A. I'm not a weatherman, but in Buffalo in November, we could have
some days where they start out cool. For example, today I believe it's
getting warmer, and the afternoons can warm up.

"Q. Okay. But November -- I mean, we're just in early September?

"A. Correct. But in November, you could have some nice days where it's
cool in the morning and then it will warm up.

"Q. Okay. How many people were in the stadium roughly, if you know?
Was it sold out?

"A. My best guess is yes, it was but I don't know that for a fact.

"Q. A lot of people wearing gloves?

"A. I don't believe so. I wasn't looking for that.

"Q. Okay. So you don't know?

"A. I really don't know.

"Q. Is there anything particularly unusual about wearing gloves on
that day?

"A. No.

"Q. Do you have men's gloves?

"A. Yes, I do.

"Q. Now are these the only pictures that you took?

"A. No, they're not.

"Q. All right. And where are the other pictures? ... (sic) I meant
that afternoon of Mr. Simpson?

"A. Of Mr. Simpson?

"Q. Yes.

"A. I believe the District Attorney has what I printed up."

MR. P. BAKER: And where are the other pictures? (Reading:)

"Q. Those are the ones you've identified here in court today and it's
actually only two different pictures, is it? Am I correct in that?

"A. Correct.

"Q. Now, I think you indicated you had a lawyer?

"A. Yes, I do.

"Q. Dealing with these pictures?

"A. Yes, I do.

"Q. When did you send the pictures that you took of Mr. Simpson to the
prosecution?"

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. Irrelevant.

THE COURT: Overruled.

MR. P. BAKER: Down at the bottom of the page (reading):

"A. I talked to my friend, who happens to be my lawyer, and I believe
it was somewhere between June 23 and June 26.

"Q. Of this year?

"A. Of this year, 1995.

"Q. Did you try to sell them to Inside_Edition before you sent them to
the prosecution?

"A. I did not try to sell them to Inside_Edition.

"Q. Did your attorney, on your behalf, try to sell them?

"A. I don't believe he did either. I'm not sure.

"Q. Was contact made with Inside_ Edition to try and negotiate the
sale of these pictures?

"A. It may have been. I don't know.

"Q. Did you authorize him to do that?

"A. No, I did not.

"Q. Do you have any knowledge of your attorney trying to sell these
pictures on your behalf?"

THE COURT: I'll sustain my own objection to that. It's getting
irrelevant.

MR. P. BAKER: Okay. Page 45048, down in the middle of the page, "who
is your lawyer?"

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. Irrelevant.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. P. BAKER: That's all I have.

MR. GELBLUM: Nothing further. And that's it. That's it for these
witnesses, Your Honor.

THE COURT: I'm ready to rule on West.

MR. GELBLUM: Okay.

THE COURT: Okay. Objection sustained. Witness served within the
jurisdiction. This is -- he is not unavailable under 240 of the
evidence code.

MR. GELBLUM: We'll try to bring him in, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Okay.

MR. KELLY: Next witness, Judge, or do you want to break.

THE COURT: Take ten minute recess. Ladies and gentlemen, don't talk
about the case, don't form or express any opinion.

(Recess.)

(Jurors resume their respective seats.)

(The following proceedings were held in open court, in the presence of
the jury.)

MR. KELLY: Your Honor, we'd like to call our next witness, Richard
Rubin.

Judge, well, he's on his way.

Could we approach?

THE COURT: Okay.

MR. KELLY: Judge, this witness, Richard Rubin, was a former employee,
the general manager, and VP of Aris, the manufacturer of this glove.

We're putting him on the stand to discuss the characteristics of this
particular glove, to identify the glove, some of the photographs that
were just put into evidence, and to discuss the manufacture and et
cetera, the crime scene photos.

And I don't want to be put in the position where I -- where on cross,
Mr. Baker may ask for a demonstration, or put up on the Elmo,
photographs or video from the criminal trial of Mr. Simpson's
deposition.

And I just don't want that put to the jury without any notice, because
once that's done, there's no way to get away from that.

We certainly do not intend to approach that on our direct case, Your
Honor.

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, they have listed this guy as an expert. And I
don't think you can play hide the ball with every witness. They played
it with about 15 others so far.

Whatever the number is, you can't play hide the ball with experts. I
get to cross-examine on full breadth of his experience.

And he was called back in the criminal trial for the express purpose,
after the gloves didn't fit, and testified relative to that. And he is
an alleged expert on these gloves. And I think I am entitled to a full
and complete cross-examination, including the video of Mr. Simpson,
those gloves not fitting.

MR. KELLY: Judge, first of all, that's only one man's opinion of
whether they fit or not.

But secondly, that was from the criminal trial, Mr. Simpson --

THE COURT: If you're offering this man as an expert, certainly that's
within the cross-examination.

MR. KELLY: I'm not questioning the bounds of the cross-examination;
it's the demonstration part, the videotape that might pop up on the
screen.

First of all, Your Honor, there was -- at the criminal case, he was
not subject to cross-examination. It was done under questionable
controls. We don't know whether his weight has changed, whether his
hand size has changed; we don't know any of those things. We have no
control over it. It was not put on for purposes --

THE COURT: If you're going to ask about fit --

MR. PETROCELLI: We're not.

MR. KELLY: We're not.

THE COURT: What are you going to ask him?

MR. KELLY: He's going to be identifying the photographs of Mr.
Simpson, identifying the gloves he's wearing in there, and identifying
the crime-scene gloves, also, in terms of the manufacture, make,
model, style, size, whether they're a pair or not, things like that.

THE COURT: With the idea of what?

MR. KELLY: Hooking them up to the receipts, Your Honor, that we put
into evidence yesterday.

THE COURT: With the idea of what?

MR. KELLY: To suggest that he owned these gloves.

THE COURT: Well, but "doesn't fit" have something to do with it?

MR. PETROCELLI: He can't --

MR. KELLY: He can't -- go ahead.

MR. PETROCELLI: You can't --

THE COURT: If you open it up, he's going to cross-examine.

MR. PETROCELLI: That's what we're here to find out.

He cannot put on in this case a videotape that's not in the official
record. A camera -- videotape from Court TV or image of Mr. Simpson
trying on gloves in the criminal case, it's hearsay as to this case.

This expert's not relying on that. He can -- he can ask --

THE COURT: He's not -- I'm sure he's not relying on it. Mr. Baker
wants to cross-examine.

MR. PETROCELLI: He can cross-examine this expert about his
observations in the courtroom, but he can't play the TV coverage of
that event.

And I think under 352, as well as the hearsay rule, it's not proper.

Your Honor, there was a lot of controversy surrounding how he put the
gloves on. He had latex gloves underneath those in the criminal case.
We don't want to get into that in this case.

MR. BAKER: But --

MR. PETROCELLI: You can cross-examine him fully. You can't bring in TV
coverage.

MR. BAKER: Yes, I can.

MR. PETROCELLI: No, you can't, any more than I can bring in TV
coverage of witnesses who testified.

In the criminal trial, Mr. Simpson was not subject to
cross-examination.

THE COURT: There is no cross-examination; it's a visual depiction of
him trying on gloves, period. There's no testimony.

MR. PETROCELLI: He can testify as to what he saw. But, Your Honor, I
think it's highly inappropriate to let him play television coverage
from another trial. And also, Mr. Simpson --

THE COURT: You showed pictures of him at football games with gloves
on.

MR. PETROCELLI: Those are authenticated by independent witnesses.

THE COURT: I don't have any problem with authenticating those glove
pictures. Do you?

MR. PETROCELLI: We think it's highly prejudicial and hearsay to put
this guy up in front of this jury to go through a dog and pony show of
how other lawyers decided to make him try on gloves.

THE COURT: You put him on --

MR. PETROCELLI: We're --

THE COURT: -- I'm going to allow him to --

MR. PETROCELLI: You're not going to --

THE COURT: -- to be cross-examined.

MR. PETROCELLI: We're going to ask him -- to ask him to identify in
the photos.

THE COURT: No; you want to connect the gloves up with the defendant.

MR. PETROCELLI: Absolutely.

THE COURT: Fine. I think fit is part of it.

MR. PETROCELLI: We have no --

THE COURT: Yes --

MR. PETROCELLI: Why should he show a video of what happened in that
court case be played in the trial?

THE COURT: What happened?

MR. PETROCELLI: Your Honor, he even -- he had latex gloves underneath.
That wasn't a control.

THE COURT: That's something you can establish on your examination, on
your redirect.

MR. PETROCELLI: We vigorously object to this, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Well, your objection is noted.

MR. PETROCELLI: I think it's highly improper to poison this jury when
what happened in that case. It's hearsay, in addition, to have him get
up in front of this jury --

THE COURT: It's appropriate cross-examination. You're putting on an
expert for the purpose of connecting the defendant to this glove; and
I think the defense has to have a reasonable opportunity to
cross-examine everything, including this purported demonstration.

MR. PETROCELLI: He can cross him on that, but why play the video?

THE COURT: So we can see it. What's better than seeing it?

MR. PETROCELLI: Because we had nothing to do with how those gloves
were put on, nor did this expert here, either.

THE COURT: I don't think that's relevant.

MR. PETROCELLI: Oh, Your Honor, I disagree with that.

Very respectfully, I think this is highly prejudicial to our case.

THE COURT: That's part of your case?

MR. PETROCELLI: Not what this these criminal lawyers did is not part
of our case. You're going to turn us into -- I'm not going to mention
anything on the record beyond what I've said.

THE COURT: All I'm saying is that the visual depiction of what Mr.
Simpson did with the gloves is an appropriate part of the
cross-examination, where you are offering a witness trying to connect
up the glove to Simpson.

MR. KELLY: Judge --

MR. PETROCELLI: I can't make my argument any more clear.

THE COURT: Well, I can't make my ruling any clearer.

MR. PETROCELLI: Judge, could we take ten minutes? Because --

MR. BREWER: Yeah, we need to talk about this.

THE COURT: Excuse me?

MR. KELLY: Could we take a few minutes?

THE COURT: Mr. Baker, they're still talking.

MR. BAKER: I'm sorry.

THE COURT: If you don't want to be part of it, that's okay.

MR. BAKER: No. I thought we just --

I apologize, sir. I thought we finished.

THE COURT: They don't want to go away.

MR. PETROCELLI: Better off staying back. I haven't said a word.

THE COURT: All right. Say what you said in his absence.

MR. PETROCELLI: Your ruling --

THE COURT: Wait a minute. He said something in his absence.

MR. PETROCELLI: Say it again.

MR. KELLY: All I asked was for ten or fifteen minutes at this time to
discuss it.

MR. BAKER: Fine.

MR. PETROCELLI: It's your ruling that he can play the video of the
criminal trial?

THE COURT: My ruling is if you offered this witness to testify as to
the gloves, and in an effort to connect the defendant up with the
gloves, by definition, the question of whether or not the glove fit
him has to be part of the connection. And that's an area that the
defense has a right to cross-examine about.

And the cross-examination may include any demonstration, physical
depiction of Mr. Simpson allegedly trying on the gloves. And that's
part of the cross-examination.

MR. PETROCELLI: Can we have a ruling through our witness he can't put
the gloves on his client during this phase?

THE COURT: I will make this ruling: If Mr. Simpson wants to try on the
gloves, he's going to have to try it on without latex gloves.

MR. PETROCELLI: Can we have him putting the gloves on out of the
presence?

THE COURT: I'm not going to make him put on the gloves.

MR. PETROCELLI: We don't want to, either. We want a ruling if he is,
are you going to permit him to put on gloves in this phase of the
examination in our case?

THE COURT: Only if he puts it on without latex.

MR. PETROCELLI: You plan to have him do that?

THE COURT: I don't think it's a fair depiction, a fair
cross-examination. To that extent, I agree with you. But nevertheless,
that's part of the physical evidence on which the defense can
cross-examine, and --

MR. PETROCELLI: I would request that if you do decide to put the
gloves on, in addition to no latex, that they be put on out of the
presence of the jury, and that he can show the jury the gloves on his
hand, but not struggling -- not struggling to get the gloves on, Your
Honor.

MR. BAKER: No.

MR. PETROCELLI: We have no control over that. If he wants to do that
in his case when he puts his client on, that's one thing; he doesn't
have to do that in our case. He wants to cross-examine the witness,
that's fine, but not going to have his client showing up in the middle
of our case and put on the gloves under circumstances we don't
control.

THE COURT: Okay. We'll cross that bridge when we get to it.

MR. PETROCELLI: You'll give us fair warning?

MR. BAKER: Of course.

MR. KELLY: Can we take 15 minutes, Judge?

THE COURT: Go to your room.

(Indicating to jury.)

(Laughter.)

THE COURT: It will be about 15 minutes.

(Jurors resume their respective seats.)

(The following proceedings were held in open court, in the presence of
the jury.)

THE CLERK: Please raise your right hand.

RICHARD RUBIN, called as a witness on behalf of Plaintiffs, was duly
sworn and testified as follows:

THE CLERK: You do solemnly swear that the testimony you may give in
the cause now pending before this court shall be the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

THE WITNESS: I do.

THE CLERK: Thank you. Please be seated.

THE WITNESS: Good morning,

THE CLERK: Sir, would you please state an spell your name for the
record.

THE WITNESS: Richard Rubin, R-U-B-I-N.

DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. KELLY:

Q. Morning, Mr. Rubin.

A. Good morning.

Q. Mr. Rubin, are you presently employed?

A. Yes, I am.

Q. And where are you employed?

A. I work for Westport Corporation, a manufacturer of small leather
goods, in the New York area.

Q. How long have you been employed there?

A. Six years.

Q. Prior to that, were you employed somewhere else?

A. Yes, I was.

Q. Where was that?

A. At Aris Isotoner, Inc., in New York City.

Q. And what type of company is Aris Isotoner?

A. It's a glove manufacturer and distribution organization.

Q. And approximately what time did you leave Aris' employ?

A. In August of 1990.

Q. And when you left there in August of 1990, what position did you
hold with Aris?

A. I was vice-president and general manager.

Q. And how long had you worked for Aris up to that point?

A. Little over 14 years.

Q. And as vice-president/general manager, what basically were your
duties and responsibilities at Aris during that time period?

A. My primary responsibility was the men's glove division, and my
secondary responsibility was leather manufacturing in the raw material
and leather manufacturing and the finished product for both men's and
ladies'.

Q. Were you familiar with basically every aspect in terms of the
styling, manufacture, and final production marketing of the gloves
made by Aris?

A. Yes, I was.

Q. Okay. And getting more specific now, are you familiar with the Aris
men's leather light glove?

A. Yes, I am.

Q. Okay. And could you describe that particular glove for me in
general terms, first of all?

A. In the most general terms, the uniqueness of the glove is the fact
that the leather is approximately 30 percent lighter than men's weight
leather, ten percent heavier than ladies' weight leather. It's
actually about five millimeters in thickness and it has a very unusual
stitch pattern that puts the gloves together, known as a Brossar
stitch.

Q. Before we go any further, how would you describe this glove, once
again in general terms, in terms of top of the line, middle-market
type item?

A. It's a real top-of-the-line product.

Q. Would you consider it a dressy glove?

A. It is a dress glove.

Q. And what colors was this particular glove, the Aris men's leather
light, made in, say, 1990?

A. Black, brown, medium brown, which was called mink, and gray.

Q. Okay. And what sizes?

A. Small, medium, large, and extra large.

Q. Okay. Now, this Aris men's leather light was manufactured by Aris;
is that correct?

A. Yes, it was.

Q. Okay. And where was that manufactured?

Where was -- where was the manufacturing taking place, actually?

A. For that glove, it was Metro Manila.

Q. And in what country?

A. Philippines.

Q. Okay.

Were there any particular years in which this Aris men's leather light
glove was manufactured?

A. It started in manufacturing in 1983, and commenced manufacturing
with that stitch pattern in 1992.

Q. Okay. And was there anybody in particular that this glove was
manufactured for?

A. It was manufactured exclusively for Bloomingdale's Department
Stores, New York City-based.

Q. When you say "manufactured exclusively," what do you mean by that?

A. Bloomingdale's, being a store of its caliber, they wanted to
separate themselves from competition, so they wanted a little bit
higher quality product that they could advertise that was exclusively
theirs. It made them, you know, just really feel that they were more
important in that segment of the industry, and they, you know,
supported it by buying quite a bit of it.

Q. Okay.

Mr. Rubin, before we go on, I want to go back to one thing.

You indicated there was a particular stitch unique to this glove that
we're talking about, the Aris men's leather light glove?

A. The Brossar stitch.

Q. Do you know what year they started utilizing this stitch?

A. In this style or in any style?

Q. In any style.

A. Possibly over 100 years ago it was used in the production of gloves
in France. But to my knowledge, at Aris, it had not really been used
in a men's glove up until about 1983.

Q. Did there come a time that the stitch you're referring to in 1983
was subsequently changed in terms of the manufacture of that
particular glove?

A. Yes. At the end of '91 beginning of '92.

Q. So, I believe earlier, you had stated that that particular stitch
started being utilized.

MR. BAKER: I move to strike "relative to when that stitch was
changed." There is no foundation.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) You stated earlier, I don't know, that you realized
they started utilizing that Brossar stitch in 1992?

A. '82.

Q. '82. Okay.

And there came a time later on, that stitch -- they started using a
different stitch.

In what year was that?

A. '92.

Q. Okay.

Now, I want to direct your attention to 1990, specifically.

Mr. Rubin, first of all, could you just tell me how many gloves -- how
many pairs of gloves, total, across the nation, Aris Isotoner
manufactured and shipped for sale that year?

A. Over four million pair.

Q. Okay.

And in 1990, did Aris still have this exclusive relationship with
Bloomingdale's you spoke of?

A. Yes, they did.

Q. So all the Aris men's light leather gloves made by Aris were only
sold in Bloomingdale's; is that right?

A. That's right.

Q. And focusing on 1990, could you tell me how many pair of the Aris
men's leather light gloves were shipped to Bloomingdale's for sale?

A. It was approximately 10,000 pair.

Q. Okay.

And could you tell me, staying with 1990 still, approximately how many
of those 10,000 pair were in the brown color?

A. Approximately 3600.

Q. And taking this one step farther still, how many of those brown
Aris men's leather light gloves were in an extra-large size, shipped
to Bloomingdale's?

A. Approximately 300.

Q. And from, you know, out of those approximately 300 brown extra
large pair of gloves shipped to Bloomingdale's for sale in 1990,
approximately how many of those pairs were actually sold?

A. Between 200 and 240 pairs.

Q. Okay.

Can you tell me what was the largest size Aris men's leather light
glove that was sold in 1990?

A. Extra large.

Q. Didn't come bigger than that, did it?

A. No, it did not.

Q. Okay.

Now, in talking about this exclusive arrangement, Bloomingdale's --

MR. KELLY: I'm sorry, Your Honor.

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) In speaking of this exclusive arrangement
Bloomingdale's had with Aris, you mentioned it were only sold in the
Bloomingdale's Department Stores?

A. That's correct.

Q. In 1990, do you recall where those Bloomingdale's Department Stores
were generally located?

A. There were 13 of them, the majority being in the metro New York/New
Jersey area.

There was one store that opened up in Chicago that year.

Q. And could you tell me in 1990 where the closest Bloomingdale's was
relative to Los Angeles?

A. Chicago.

Q. None in between?

A. No.

Q. Okay.

And there wasn't any in Los Angeles?

A. Not at that point in time.

Q. Do you know if Bloomingdale's ever opened in Los Angeles?

A. I think they opened a store last week here.

Q. Okay.

Now, before, when we were discussing your familiarity with the Aris
men's leather light glove, we talked about the colors and sizes that
it comes in, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And you also indicated a familiarity with the specific design and
manufacture of that glove, also?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

Now, could you, in more detail if possible, describe in 1990 the style
and manufacture of the men's Aris leather light glove?

A. Well, the two most distinctive features were the Brossar stitches,
which were extremely tight and close, approximately 22 to 24 stitches
to the inch.

And the second most visible characteristic was the blind hem, which
was very much in vogue, and still is in vogue in ladies' gloves, but
very rare in men's gloves.

And once you go past those two, you get a little more traditional. You
have three needle points on the back, and you have a palm vent on the
palm side to help pull it on.

And then another very unique characteristic was the lining being extra
lightweight. It was a -- one single thread of cashmere yarn knitted on
a ten-gauge machine, which made the entire glove very thin and very
slender looking.

Q. What about the gauge of the leather itself?

A. And the very lightweight leather, being 5.5 millimeters.

Q. And most of these characteristics, are these things that you would
be able to identify by looking at the glove?

A. Yes.

Q. And could you tell me whether these particular gloves were designed
to fit in a specific way?

A. They were designed to fit skin tight, be very slender.

Q. And the gloves that were being sold in 1990 in the Bloomingdale's
Department Stores, when would they have been manufactured?

A. In the late fall: November, December of 1989; in the spring, once,
of 1990.

Q. And the characteristics that you just attributed to these gloves,
that held true for all those gloves manufactured in 1990, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. Did there come a time that any of these characteristics that you
just mentioned previously did change?

A. They changed the stitching from a Brossar stitching to a -- what is
called a half pique stitch in 1992.

Q. Is the half PK stitch something you're able to visibly identify by
looking at the glove?

A. It's very distinctive.

Q. Would it be fair to say you would be able to, in effect, date the
manufacture of the glove, at least by examining that stitch?

A. Yes, I would.

Q. Okay.

Now, with regard to the extra large gloves, is there a standard
approximate length of these gloves when they're manufactured?

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, I think that's a contradiction of terms. In
those two questions there are two words, "standard" and "approximate."
It's vague and ambiguous.

THE COURT: You understand the question?

MR. KELLY: I'll rephrase it, Judge.

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) Is there -- with the extra large Aris gloves, is
there a standard length of that glove for the extra large?

A. In the manufacturing process, there is a pattern; and if it came
out perfectly, it would be around ten and three-eighths inches long.

Q. Is there usually some variation on that length?

A. Every piece of leather will have a little bit different flexibility
and elasticity to it, so there can be a variance. But the standard
would be ten and three-eighths in a finished product.

MR. KELLY: Your Honor, if I might hand these to the witness.

THE COURT: Okay.

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) I'm going to ask you to look at these two items. And
one of them is 129 and one of them is 204.

(Witness reviews exhibits.)

THE WITNESS: Do you want me to look at them through the bag, or do you
want me to take them out of the bag?

MR. KELLY: Is it all right if opens the bag and takes them out, Your
Honor?

THE COURT: It's all right with me.

(Witness opens bag and removes glove.)

THE REPORTER: Excuse me. Is there a number?

May I have that number?

MR. BAKER: May we ask the witness not to pull the gloves.

THE COURT: Don't pull the gloves.

THE WITNESS: The number on the right hand is 164-A.

MR. PETROCELLI: Those are the wrong numbers. Those are the exhibit
numbers from the criminal trial. The two --

MR. KELLY: The exhibit number in this matter is on the plastic itself.

THE WITNESS: The number on this, number 9 --

MR. KELLY: It should be in the upper right-hand corner, 129.

THE WITNESS: 204 or 1464-E.

MR. PETROCELLI: And this?

THE WITNESS: And this one is 129. And the right hand was 204 and the
left hand was 129.

(Witness removed both gloves from their packaging.)

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) Have you seen those gloves prior to today, Mr.
Rubin?

A. Yes, I have.

Q. And you saw them over a year ago, actually, in Mr. Simpson's
criminal trial; is that correct?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Did you have an opportunity at that time to measure the length of
those gloves?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. You measured those gloves at this time.

What was the length of the gloves when you measured them, if you
recall?

A. Nine and three-eighths inches long.

Q. Approximately an inch less than the standard length?

A. Approximately.

Q. What percent is smaller than the standard extra large would that
have made them at this time?

A. Between 10 and 11 percent.

Q. And what would you attribute, or could you attribute that
differential of the 10 or 11 percent to anything?

MR. BAKER: I'm going to object. Foundation; calls for speculation.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: Combination of normal wear and tear, time, and shrinkage.

Q. MR. KELLY: Are you familiar with the sales receipts of
Bloomingdale's?

A. I've seen them.

Q. Okay.

You familiar with the different descriptions on them in viewing them?

A. Yes, I am.

Q. Okay.

MR. KELLY: If we can see 390, Steve.

(Mr. Foster displays Exhibit 390.)

Q. MR. KELLY: Are you able to see that where you're sitting, Mr.
Rubin, or would you like to step over?

A. I can see it. I'm familiar with it.

Q. Okay.

Can you describe --

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, I'm going to object. This is beyond the scope
of this criminal testimony, trial testimony.

THE COURT: Overruled.

You want him to look at that? Go ahead.

MR. KELLY: Yes.

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, may we be heard on this?

We had a stipulation relative to these witnesses, that they wouldn't
go beyond their criminal trial testimony. And that's what they're
attempting to do here. Plus, this is cumulative, Your Honor.

MR. KELLY: There was some testimony from the criminal trial --

THE COURT: Okay. Approach the bench.

(The following proceedings were held at the bench, with the reporter:)

THE COURT: What stipulation haven't I seen?

MR. BAKER: We have a stipulation, and I think the stipulation was that
we wouldn't take everybody's depositions, if they were not going to go
into the criminal-trial testimony -- he's an expert; he's part of the
stipulation. And unless I missed testimony -- I've been through three
days of his testimony in the criminal trial -- this was not in there.

THE COURT: Okay. Cite me chapter and verse.

MR. KELLY: Where he cites it?

THE COURT: Yeah.

MR. KELLY: Okay. Your Honor, this is foundational.

THE COURT: I don't care. When there's an objection, I have to rule.

MR. KELLY: Okay. Let me see if we can pull that out.

(Pause in the proceedings.)

MR. KELLY: Pull it up on our computer quickly.

Judge, in the prior testimony there, he repeatedly refers to the SKU
and style number used by Bloomingdale's of 70263.

This was the only thing I was going to ask him to testify to for
foundational purposes, is to the style number of the glove that's
listed on that receipt, also.

It's mentioned approximately 15 times in the trial transcript in his
testimony in terms of the style number of this glove sold by
Bloomingdale's.

THE COURT: Okay.

(The following proceedings were held in open court, in the presence of
the jury.)

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) Mr. Rubin, were you aware of a SKU number that was
assigned to this style of glove by Bloomingdale's for sales purposes.

A. I was aware of our SKU number.

Q. Was that a style number?

A. Yes.

Q. What style number was that?

A. 70263.

Q. And what was 70263 collective of?

A. Well, the first two digits reflected the fact that it was a men's
leather glove, and the next few digits are sequential as part of the
design process. Each new design was the next number.

Q. Okay.

By the way, do you know whether --

Do you know, in December of 1990, what the list --

THE COURT: Mr. Kelly.

MR. KELLY: I'm sorry, Your Honor. I'm sorry. An old habit.

THE COURT: I don't want Mr. Kelly to feel disadvantaged by the fact I
keep telling him to move over. I know it's kind of annoying,
sometimes, to have somebody standing behind you talking. And I'm
trying to make it comfortable for the jurors, so that none of the
attorneys stand behind the jurors when they're talking.

So I'm asking all of the attorneys to stay well to the right of that
last juror.

MR. KELLY: I'm not the only one that doesn't listen.

(Laughter.)

THE COURT: Thank you.

MR. KELLY: Okay.

Could I have my last question read back.

(The reporter read the record as follows:)

"Q. Okay. By the way, do you know whether -- Do you know, in December
of 1990, what the list --"

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) The list price of these men's Aris leather light
gloves was?

A. Fifty-five dollars.

Q. Do you know whether there was a sale going on at Bloomingdale's?

A. On occasion, they had sales.

And yes, at this time, they did have a sale.

Q. Do you know what the sale price of that item was?

A. It was -- this particular sale was a 30-percent discount.

MR. BAKER: No foundation, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Lay a foundation.

MR. BAKER: To this witness' knowledge.

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) Do you have any personal knowledge as to whether or
not the list price in Bloomingdale's for the Aris men's leather lights
had been changed at all in December of 1990?

A. On occasion, it was changed.

Q. Well, I have to ask you, specifically, do you have your own
knowledge whether that list price had been changed in December of
1990?

A. Yes, it was.

Q. And do you know what it was changed to?

A. Certain times it was 25 percent off; at certain times it was 30
percent off.

Q. In December of 1990, do you know what the percentage was?

A. Thirty percent off.

Q. Do you know what that would reduce that fifty-five-dollar list
price to?

A. Thirty-eight fifty.

Q. Would it be fair to say that two pair of those gloves at $55 each,
reduced by 30 percent, would be a total of --

A. Seventy-seven dollars.

Q. Now, I want to go back to Exhibits 129 and 204 a little bit.

Do you have those in front of you still?

A. Yes.

Q. When you indicated that you recognize those from the criminal trial
of Mr. Simpson's --

A. I recognized them long before the criminal trial, but I do
recognize these from the criminal trial, yes.

Q. Those particular gloves I'm speaking of.

A. This pair.

Q. Okay.

And did you have occasion, when you were testifying in the criminal
trial, to observe Mr. Simpson's conduct, a demonstration where he was
asked to put the gloves on?

MR. BAKER: I'm going to object. That misstates the evidence.

The prosecution and the judge ordered Mr. Simpson to put those gloves
on.

THE COURT: It's a neutral question. Overruled.

MR. KELLY: Can you read the question back to him, please.

(The reporter read the record as follows:)

"Q. And did you have occasion, when you were testifying in the
criminal trial, to observe Mr. Simpson conduct a demonstration where
he was asked to put the gloves on?"

THE WITNESS: Yes, I do.

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) Were you able to --

You actually saw him conduct that demonstration himself, where he did
put the gloves on; is that correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. And did you form an opinion, yourself, as to whether or not the
gloves fit?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. And what was your opinion on that?

A. They fit with a poor quality of fit, but they fit.

Q. And when you say they fit with a poor quality, what do you base
that opinion on, the poor-quality aspect?

A. They were --

They were one inch short in the wrist.

Q. And do you have an opinion as to what would have caused them to be
that one inch shorter in the wrist?

MR. BAKER: Objection. Foundation; calls for speculation.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: In this particular case, there were two issues: One was
the fact that he was required to.

MR. BAKER: I move to strike as nonresponsive, Your Honor, as to his
opinion, not the issues in the case.

THE COURT: You may state your response to the question

MR. KELLY: Can you read the question back to him, please.

(The reporter read the record as follows:)

"Q. And do you have an opinion as to what would have caused them to be
that one inch shorter in the wrist?"

Q. Were there any factors you take into consideration?

A. The first factor was that the gloves were actually one inch shorter
than standard --

Q. Okay?

A. -- in a north/south position.

The second factor was that there was a requirement to utilize latex
linings over the hands prior to putting the gloves on.

Q. You mean in simple terms, Mr. Simpson had latex gloves on; is that
correct?

A. Correct.

Q. Okay.

A. And the third issue was that the actual overall condition of the
gloves, being crumbled up quite a bit and not straightened out, I
would call it refurbished. It's really just they hadn't been used in a
long, long time.

Q. So when you put gloves on, you --

A. Work them out a little bit.

Q. To the best of your knowledge, that had not been done with these
particular gloves?

MR. BAKER: Objection. Leading.

THE COURT: Sustained as leading.

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) And those were the three factors that you base your
opinion on; is that correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. Okay.

And I believe earlier, you mentioned -- you stated your reasons for
the apparent difference of one inch between the normal length of the
extra large glove and these gloves when you measured them.

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Once again, what was that attributed to?

A. Normal wear and tear, time, and shrinkage.

Q. Okay.

Now, looking at 129 again --

Do you have that it in front of you, there Mr. Rubin?

A. This is the left-hand glove?

Q. Yes.

A. Yes.

Q. Okay. I'm going to ask you to examine that glove closely at this
time.

(Witness complies, reviews exhibit.)

THE WITNESS: Okay.

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) Okay.

You had a chance to look at it?

A. Could I put my hand in it?

Q. Sure. Yes.

(Witness puts hand in exhibit.)

MR. BAKER: Can you put your hands in it where I can see?

(Witness complies.)

(Witness puts on Exhibit 129.)

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) While you are on this, Mr. Rubin, if you can, take a
look at the characteristics we used earlier, the stitching and the
three needle points on the back of the hand, et cetera.

A. Yes.

Q. Can you describe all the characteristics of that particular glove
that you observed?

A. One would be the unique stitching, sewing the glove completely
together.

Two is this blind hem at the end of the wrist.

Q. I'm sorry. Going back, is there a name you had for that stitching?

A. Brossar stitching.

Q. Okay.

I'm sorry?

A. The blind hem at the end of the wrist. Then the other more common
characteristics are the three, needle points, where there are actually
three needles with thread that create these design elements.

And then there's a palm vent in the wrist.

And then there's this thin cashmere lining, ten-gauge liner.

Q. Okay.

Are you able to tell me, after looking at all those specific
characteristics, what type of glove it is?

A. It's still 70263, brown, extra large.

Q. There's another men's Aris leather light?

A. Yes.

Q. Is there a label?

A. Yes, there is.

Q. It says the same thing?

A. It says the name and the size and the content and manufacturer; it
does not say the style number.

Q. Okay.

Now, have you had an opportunity to look at the inside of the lining
of the glove, underneath?

A. I did during the criminal trial.

Q. If you recall still, are there any identifying characteristics or
anything that appear on the lining of the -- the inside of that glove?

A. There's a size marking, there's a cutter number, and a sequence
control number.

Q. Okay.

First of all, we know the size number just indicates the size of the
glove, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. Okay.

What is the cutter number?

A. I'm going to have to pull the lining out for a second to --

Q. Okay.

A. -- see that.

Q. Sure.

A. The cutter number is 359.

The sequence or control number is 9.

And then the XL is the size.

Q. Now, what exactly is a cutter number?

A. The cutter number is the actual individual who was given the
leather to cut X amount of pair of this style during the manufacturing
process. It was a way of controlling the leather.

Q. And what is the sequence number, by definition?

A. The sequence number was to keep all the parts together so that the
colors matched, because they did vary across the skins. They would
actually -- the cutter would say, this is the first pair; I made the
second, the third, the fourth. And he would keep all the parts
together. That way -- this was nine pair of that particular lot of
leather that was given to the cutter.

Q. Okay.

There was an extra large; the cutter number sequence number 9?

A. Yes.

Q. I'm going ask you to look at 204, which would be the right-hand
glove there.

Also, if you can go through the same process, first of all, of trying
it on.

MR. BAKER: I don't understand why he's trying it on, Your Honor. I
don't understand why this is relevant to any issue in this case.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) Now, while you're trying that glove on and looking
at it, I'm going to ask you to examine it closely once again for all
the specific characteristics we discussed before.

A. It has the same characteristics as the other half pair.

Q. That's the Brossar stitch and the three-point needles -- the three
needle points; I'm sorry, and the lined hem and the other things?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

And are you able to tell me with certainty who the manufacturer of
that glove is, also?

First of all, can you tell me, without looking at the label, Mr.
Rubin, who made that glove?

A. This is an Aris 70263 brown glove.

Q. Okay.

Now, I see you're already doing it. I was going to ask you to look
inside the lining of that glove, also, for those identifying
characteristics.

(Witness complies, turns glove inside out.)

A. Yes. The cutter number was 359; the sequence number is 9; and the
size is XL, makes it a pair.

Q. As a result of looking at those identifying characteristics of the
two gloves, are you able to tell me what, if any, relationship there
is between the two of those gloves?

A. They are a pair.

Q. No doubt about that?

A. No doubt about it.

Q. Okay.

MR. KELLY: Now, if I could just have one minute. (Pause in
proceedings.)

MR. KELLY: Steve, if we could go to --

Well, before we go to that --

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) Mr. Rubin, also in the criminal trial that we
discussed earlier, you had the opportunity to view a number of
photographs, also, did you not?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Okay. Those were basically Mr. Simpson wearing gloves at different
times?

A. That's correct.

Q. And in addition to viewing them in court, did you make some sort of
independent investigation and examination of those photos, also?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

MR. KELLY: Now, first of all, can we put up Exhibit 642, Steve

(Mr. Foster complies.)

Q. Now, first of all, do you recognize the individual in the
photograph?

A. Yes, I do.

Q. And that's Mr. Simpson?

A. I believe so.

Q. Okay.

The man you saw with the gloves in the criminal trial; is that
correct?

A. Correct.

Q. Okay.

Now, looking at 642 --

MR. KELLY: First of all, I didn't see -- Steve, can you put up 643?

(Mr. Foster complies.)

MR. KELLY: Steve, it's just the close-up. I want the close-up, please.

(Mr. Foster complies.)

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) This is basically the close-up of the picture you
were looking at a second ago, Mr. Rubin.

Could you examine the glove closely that's blurred on the screen right
now?

A. I can do my best.

Q. Okay.

MR. KELLY: Steve, can you take it back a little further, even?

(Mr. Foster complies.)

MR. KELLY: That's good.

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) I'm going ask you if you can look at this and
identify the specific characteristics of the manufacturer of that
particular glove.

A. I can see three characteristics.

Q. What characteristics?

A. The very fine rib stitches, which is indicative of the Brossar
stitch; the vent in the palm; and then on the lower left, if you see
where the shadow is, it would appear to be that the hem didn't have
any stitching on it; it was a blind hem.

Q. Okay.

And based on those characteristics, are you able to conclude the
manufacture and make model and style of that particular glove?

A. It would appear to me to be a Brossar 70263 style.

Q. The Aris men's leather light?

A. Yes.

Q. And based on the type of stitching, would you be able to opine as
to when that was manufactured, approximately?

A. The bulk of the gloves that we made Brossar stitches on were made
in the late '80s. So '88, '89, '90.

Q. That stitch wasn't used after '92, I believe you indicated.

A. That's correct.

MR. KELLY: Now, 655 Steve.

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) By the way, that picture that was just taken down.
What color was that glove?

A. It appeared to be black.

Q. Okay.

MR. KELLY: And just before you put that up, Steve, I want to ask him
one other question.

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) The previous glove -- I'm sorry, Mr. Rubin. I'm
going put this photo back up one more time.

I'm going to ask you, excluding color, would you be able to tell me
how it compares to Exhibit 129 and 204, the gloves in front of you
now?

A. It's the same.

Q. Identical manufacture, make, model, style, and everything?

A. Yes.

THE COURT REPORTER: Excuse me. Is a that 643?

MR. PETROCELLI: Yes.

(Exhibit 643 displayed.)

MR. KELLY: Now 645. I'm sorry.

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) Now, I'd ask you to look at that glove in that
photo, first of all, Mr. Rubin.

A. Yes.

Q. Are you able to observe some of the characteristics we've spoken of
before?

A. I can see two characteristics.

Q. Which ones are those?

A. The Brossar stitching and the three needle points that is in the
middle of the glove to the left.

Q. Okay.

MR. KELLY: And can you throw up 656, Steve?

Would it help for the lights to be turned off?

JUROR: Sure.

MR. KELLY: Your Honor, could we turn the lights off for this viewing?

THE COURT: You may.

(Exhibit 656 displayed.)

MR. KELLY: Little further back.

Q. Looking at that photo, are you able to observe any of the specific
characteristics we're speaking of?

A. Just the Brossar stitching at the top of the gloves, where it goes
around -- around the top.

Q. Okay.

And based on those, I believe you referred to them as "unique
details;" is that right?

A. Yes.

Q. Are you able to reach a conclusion as to the manufacture, make, and
model and style of that glove?

A. Both -- that is the most unique detail to style 70263, so I would
say this is a style 70263.

Q. I'm sorry. What is the most unique?

A. The Brossar stitching.

Q. Okay.

And excluding color, can you tell me how that glove compares to the
two gloves there in front of you, the 129 and 204, the right-hand and
left-hand gloves?

A. They're the same.

Q. Excluding color; is that correct?

A. That's correct.

MR. KELLY: Now, 660, please.

(Exhibit 660 is displayed.)

MR. KELLY: Focus in a little on that glove, Steve.

(Mr. Foster complies.)

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) I'll ask you to take a look at that glove.

Tell me when you can observe any of the specific characteristics we've
been speaking of.

A. In this glove, I can see the Brossar stitching around the fingers,
the three needle points down -- down the back of the glove. And then
actually, it appears that the Aris label is actually sticking out, to
the left bottom.

Q. You can actually see the tag, can you not?

A. But that is not an unusual characteristic; that just happens to be
there because every Aris glove had a label.

Q. This is sort of a throw-in?

A. Yes.

MR. KELLY: I'll withdraw the last comment.

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) Can you actually identify that as an Aris label?

A. I cannot read anything on the label.

It appears to be in the same location that we put our labels in,
compared to other manufacturers, and it appears to be the color that
we use, compared to other manufacturers. So I believe it's an Aris
glove.

Q. Okay.

And even excluding the tag altogether, would you be able to identify
that from the other specific characteristics you spoke of before?

A. Yes.

And in this one, there also -- you can see the brown tint to the
cashmere lining.

Q. And where is that, by the way,

THE WITNESS: Can you raise the glove up a little bit on the screen?

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) Can you point that out, please.

A. It would be in this area right here.

(Indicating.)

Q. And the stitch you spoke of, what year did they stop using that
particular stitch?

A. In 1992.

Q. Okay.

So if you had to date that glove in a particular time, would you?

A. Bulk of it is late '80s.

Q. But before '92?

A. Yes.

Q. And in looking in that glove, would you tell me how that compares
to the two gloves you have there in front of you, also?

A. Same style.

Q. Would it be fair to say it's identical, except for color?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

MR. KELLY: Now, if we could go to -- you can take that off, Steve.

(Mr. Foster removes exhibit from TV screen.)

(Counsel displays blow-up photo.)

MR. KELLY: Is that better, to use a picture?

Actually, if I could hand this to the witness first, Judge.

THE COURT: You may.

MR. KELLY: Yeah. Take a look at that.

Can you put that 641 up.

THE WITNESS: Okay.

(Witness reviews Exhibit 641.)

MR. KELLY: Why don't you lay it flat here for reference.

If you could, zoom in a little on the gloves, Steve.

(Mr. Foster adjusts TV screen.)

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) Now, looking at that glove, both on the screen and
the enlargement before you, are you able to observe any of the
specific characteristics we've been discussing before?

A. I can see the Brossar stitching on the photo.

I really can't see it on this screen, but I can see the blind hem and
the points in both places.

MR. KELLY: Get that in, Steve.

(Mr. Foster adjusts TV screen.)

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) Is that better, Mr. Rubin?

A. It is.

Q. Looking at the photograph, enlargements from the view, are you able
to --

A. I'd like to stick to the photo, please.

Q. Okay.

What specific characteristics are you able to observe?

A. The Brossar stitching on the top of the forefinger at the top, and
the three point, and the blind hem.

And also the characteristics of the light leather shows -- up here,
where you can see the wrinkles, you can see that it's very thin.

Q. And what color of manufacture is that glove, by the way?

A. It's a brown shade.

Q. That's a brown.

MR. KELLY: Steve, could I briefly see 645?

(Mr. Foster displays Exhibit 645.)

MR. KELLY: If you could, zoom in on the gloves a little bit.

(Mr. Foster adjusts TV screen.)

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) Are you able to see the -- any of the specific
characteristics from that photo?

A. On the screen, it's a little blurry, Mr. Kelly.

I've seen the photo before.

Q. Okay.

A. I've identified the photo before on the screen. I'm not -- I can't
say that I can identify much on the screen.

MR. KELLY: Can we try 646 to see if it's any better?

(Mr. Foster displays Exhibit 646.)

THE WITNESS: This is better.

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) Okay.

Are you able, from that photograph there, to identify the -- any of
the specific characteristics we've been speaking of?

A. I can see the fine ridge of the Brossar stitching on a couple -- on
a couple of the fingers, and I can see the point.

Q. Can you make any observation as to the hem we've been speaking of?

A. It's a little -- it's a little dark to -- I'll reserve judgment on
that.

Q. Okay.

Looking on the photo you have in front of you, though --

A. The hem is clear.

Q. And what observation do you make about the photo in front of you?

A. It's a blind hem.

(Referring to photo Exhibit 646.)

MR. KELLY: I'm going ask you to put up pictures 645 and 646 again, see
if they're clearer there.

(Witness reviews actual photo.)

THE WITNESS: Yes, I can see on both photos. I can see the Brossar
stitching, the points and the blind hem from these photos.

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) Okay.

If you could, just --

MR. KELLY: Actually, let me take them back from you.

Steve, if I could see 654, please, if we go to frame 4583.

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) I ask you to look specifically at the left-hand
glove in that picture, Mr. Rubin.

A. Yes.

Q. Can you make any observation as to specific characteristics we
discussed before with regard to that glove?

A. Yes. The palm vent is visible on the left hand.

Q. And what exactly do you mean by "the palm vent?" You keep
mentioning that.

A. In the palm of the hand, there's usually a vent that would help a
person slip the gloves on and off a little bit more easily and gives
you something to pull on.

Q. With 129 or 204, could you hold one of those up for the jury and
demonstrate, if you could, what the palm vent is?

A. This is the vent.

(Indicating to glove.)

MR. KELLY: I've shown you -- if we could go to, Steve, 5548, 49.

If you could look at the --

Take it back down, Steve.

Stop right there.

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) Are you able to make an observation -- I don't know
if it's real clear -- as to the right-hand glove?

A. It's totally blurred to me.

Q. Okay.

(Reviewing videotape.)

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) Would you agree with me that all of these
photographs were the same time, place -- same place?

A. It appears that way.

Q. Okay.

You've seen them all before, have you not?

MR. BAKER: Wait. I object. He is asking this witness to say that all
these photographs were at the same time and the same place.

MR. KELLY: I'll withdraw the question, Your Honor.

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) Okay.

With regard to 641, once again, which would be the enlargement down
here --

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

MR. KELLY: And if you could flip up, Steve, on the video once again,
frame 4583.

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) Could you state for me all the specific
characteristics of the Aris men's leather light that you're able to
observe between those two photographs?

A. There are four of them.

Q. What are those?

A. The Brossar stitching on the fingers closing the glove down the
side, the three needle points, and the blind hem and the palm vent.

Q. And based on those specific characteristics you just mentioned, are
you able to tell me with certainty what the manufacture, make, model
and style of those gloves are?

A. 70263, brown.

Q. That's the Aris men's leather light?

A. Yes, it is.

Q. Okay.

Can you tell me how that 70263 Aris men's leather light brown, those
gloves depicted in those photographs, compare to the two gloves you
have in front of you there?

A. Same style, color.

Q. Is it fair to say they're identical?

A. Yes.

MR. KELLY: If I could have one moment.

(Pause in proceedings.)

MR. KELLY: I have no further questions.

THE COURT: Cross-examine.

CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. BAKER:

Q. Mr. Rubin, how much time have you spent with the plaintiff
attorneys since Mr. Simpson was acquitted in October of 1995?

A. Less than three hours.

Q. How much time on the telephone and in person?

A. On the telephone, less than 15 minutes.

Q. If -- and the other three hours you've been together with them?

A. Yes.

Q. And how much time did you spend with the district attorney, when
you were testifying for them in the criminal trial?

MR. KELLY: Objection. Irrelevant.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: I lost count. However, I was out there four different
times. If I had to guess, 12 to 15 hours.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) And you viewed the videotape many times with Mr.
Simpson trying the gloves on in the courtroom, did you not?

MR. KELLY: Objection. Irrelevant.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: You've seen it.

MR. BAKER: And let's play that now, Phil.

MR. PETROCELLI: Our position is on the record, Your Honor.

THE COURT: It is.

MR. BAKER: We're going to get there. I'm sorry. You want to --

MR. KELLY: I'd object to the audio.

THE COURT: Excuse me?

MR. KELLY: I object to the audio being played.

THE COURT: All right. Keep the audio off.

(Video of Mr. Simpson putting on gloves is played while audio is
turned off.)

THE COURT: What are you doing?

MR. BAKER: I think he put the other one --

(Video continues playing.)

MR. BAKER: Okay.

(Video stops playing.)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) That's what you saw in the courtroom?

A. That's correct.

Q. Those gloves fit across the palm, did they?

A. I didn't say that.

Q. I just asked you that?

A. They actually did fit across the palm.

Q. They did?

A. Yes.

Q. What we saw is, in your opinion, those gloves both fit Mr. Simpson,
right?

MR. KELLY: Objection. Argumentative.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) In your opinion, sir, those gloves both fit Mr.
Simpson; yes or no?

A. Yes.

Q. And in your opinion, is that -- the latex makes it easier or harder
to put gloves on?

A. Harder.

Q. You should have never put the latex on in that courtroom that Mr.
Simpson put on, and you don't know whether or not talcum is over that
latex glove; isn't that true?

A. That's not true.

Q. Let me ask you a couple of questions.

Relative to your viewing of, first of all, the -- did you look at the
measurements of the gloves when they were first collected?

A. No, I did not.

MR. KELLY: Objection. Well --

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You don't know whether the D.A. measured the glove,
that is, the LAPD measured the glove and it was exactly the same
measurements as when you measured the glove?

MR. KELLY: Objection. Irrelevant, beyond the scope.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: I have no knowledge of that.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, let's talk about you say the gloves were
unused, that is, they hadn't been used in a while. Do you know how
many District Attorneys put those gloves on before the glove
demonstration that you just saw?

A. I have no knowledge of that.

Q. So you don't know, as you sit here today whether or not those
gloves had been used multiple, multiple times before Mr. Simpson was
required to put those on in the criminal trial; isn't that true, sir?

A. I -- that's not true. I had an indication that they had not been
used, or tried on due to the appearance of the gloves when I was first
shown them, upon arrival in Los Angeles, my first visit.

Q. Well, when Mr. Simpson put the gloves on, it wasn't your first
visit, was it, Mr. Rubin?

A. Yes, it was.

Q. Well, is it your testimony that you were told that no one, since
those gloves had been collected, had put those gloves on before they
were tried on Mr. Simpson?

MR. KELLY: Objection. Asking for hearsay, Your Honor.

MR. BAKER: Goes to the state of his mind, Your Honor.

MR. KELLY: Could I ask --

THE COURT: I'll sustain the objection.

MR. KELLY: Could I have that picture taken off the screen while we're
at this part of the examination?

THE COURT: Okay. Go ahead.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Did anyone indicate to you that the gloves had not
been used -- strike that.

In forming the opinions that you gave here today in court, was it your
opinion, based upon what you had learned from the D.A.'s office in
your multiple visits and your conversations with the District
Attorney, that the gloves had not been put on by anybody from the time
they were collected until the time Mr. Simpson put them on in the
courtroom?

MR. KELLY: Objection. Calls for hearsay, Your Honor.

THE COURT: You may answer, yes or no.

THE WITNESS: It was not discussed with me.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) So, you didn't have any knowledge based upon the
D.A.'s conversations with you, the amount of times those gloves had,
in fact, been dried on before Mr. Simpson put them on, correct?

MR. KELLY: Objection. Calls for hearsay, asked and answered.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Well, assuming those gloves had been tried on
multiple times, including the day of the demonstration, you would
agree that that wouldn't have inhibited their ability to be put on by
Mr. Simpson, true?

MR. KELLY: Objection. Argumentative.

THE COURT: Assumes a fact not in evidence.

MR. KELLY: Assumes --

MR. BAKER: It's a hypothetical, obviously. This is an expert witness.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. BAKER: On which ground?

THE COURT: Not a basis for the hypothetical.

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, I will tie it up.

THE COURT: I'll sustain the objection at this point.

MR. BAKER: Let me make an offer of proof. We will tie it up but those
gloves had been tried on multiple times. He's from another state.

MR. PETROCELLI: We object to his testifying.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. KELLY: Ask that last comment be stricken also.

THE COURT: It's stricken.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, let's talk a little bit about Brossar
stitching, may we, Mr. Rubin?

MR. KELLY: Objection to the form of the question.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, Mr. Rubin, Brossar stitching has been used for
over 100 years, has it not?

A. That's correct.

Q. And Brossar stitching is a particular type of stitching made from a
Singer sewing machine, right?

A. In the facility that I'm familiar with, it was.

Q. And it's been made, not only in the facility that's run by Aris,
but it's been made by other glove manufacturers for years, hasn't it?

A. I'm not aware of that.

Q. Did you check to find out?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. You checked with two glove manufacturers. How many glove
manufacturers are there, Mr. Rubin, in the United States?

A. None.

Q. Well, how many glove -- how many people do we import our gloves for
that distribute out gloves under their brand names? Let me ask you
that question.

A. There may be six or ten.

Q. It's over a dozen people, manufacturers that have labels on gloves
in this country, are there not?

A. No, there may be licensed products and importers, but as far as
manufacturers, there may be only 6 or 10.

Q. All right. Then, let's start back in. The Brossar stitching was not
unique to Aris. You would agree with that?

A. For my 14 years in the business, I was not aware of Brossar
stitching being used by anybody in present men's product. I did see it
in some lady's product, but I never saw it in a men's glove.

Q. Before you became involved in this case, you didn't do an analysis
to determine whether or not there was Brossar stitching in any glove
other than the Aris leather light, true?

A. Prior to this case?

Q. Yes.

A. I did nothing.

Q. Now, in manufacturers in the world, how many manufacturers in the
world are there that make penny leather gloves, to your knowledge?

A. I don't have a good answer on that. There may be hundreds and
hundreds of them. They may be small, but I'm only familiar with a
handful of large manufacturers.

Q. And did you say that the answer would be true relative to Brossar
stitching that you're not sure how many of those hundreds and hundreds
of -- or hundreds, at least, of manufacturers would use Brossar
stitching?

A. I'm not aware of them.

Q. In fact, smaller companies would generally use Brossar stitching
over large companies; isn't that true?

A. I don't have any knowledge to verify that.

Q. Well, the machines that you're company used were manufactured in
the 40's were they not?

A. Or before.

Q. And they were old machines that could be purchased relatively
cheaply because of the fact that they were -- had seen a lot of years
of service; isn't that correct?

A. The only reason I would have to disagree with what you're saying is
that the Brossar stitching system was so slow and so labor intensive,
it wasn't really very profitable. So that on balance, one would really
not want to be using this equipment. They would probably want to using
other equipment.

Q. Sir, maybe my question is a poor one. Certainly in modern countries
we want to, regardless of the look of the Brossar stitching, we
probably want to do it quicker and make it more efficient; isn't that
correct?

A. True.

Q. In -- a lot of gloves are manufactured in third world countries;
isn't that correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And in third world countries, the issue of efficiency isn't as
great as the issue of trying to get a machine that will, in fact, make
a stitch; isn't that true?

A. It's a combination of both.

Q. All right. Now, the three points on a glove, virtually every
machine's dress glove has that; isn't that true?

A. They have the three points. They're not all necessarily in the same
configuration.

Q. But I mean there's one down the middle and then they usually have
points to either side, don't they, sir?

A. That's -- I'm talking about a three-needle point versus just a
point.

Q. All right. And the palm, virtually every dress glove that are made
for men, and indeed women, have a palm fit, don't they?

A. Mainly in men's.

Q. Okay.

Now, as I understand it, these gloves are made to fit skin tight and
that's the style that they are made to; that's what their uniqueness
is, correct, these 70263 series?

A. Very dressy, very skin tight.

Q. And so they're not what one would consider a glove that you would
wear, for example, certainly at a ski lodge, right?

A. I wouldn't recommend it.

Q. If it gets 20 degrees below zero, it's not the type of glove you
want on; true?

A. That's correct.

Q. You want a bulky glove that has more leather an certainly a thicker
lining? I'll get it out yet.

A. That's correct.

Q. Just for the warmth of the glove?

A. That's correct.

Q. Especially, if you're going to use a glove, you know, and you're
going to be out in the -- in the weather for two to three hours,
that's not the type of glove you would choose. You agree about that --
with that?

A. Not in severe weather.

Q. Okay.

Now, the lining of that glove is as you suggested, I think,
particularly thin, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. And the lining of that glove would be the first thing to wear out
in the glove being normally used, correct?

A. In this model, yes.

Q. And in the linings, when you first look at those gloves, showed
very little wear at all; isn't that true?

A. That's true.

Q. And the palm of the glove should wear out after the lining in
normal usage, you would agree with that?

A. Yes, I would.

Q. And the palm in these gloves are in, I believe, which one is it,
the right or the left?

A. I don't know what the question is, so --

Q. That's a good point: There's wear indications in the right glove,
correct, all the way through the leather?

A. That's correct.

Q. In the palm. True?

A. True.

Q. With no corresponding wear in the lining underneath it, correct?

A. True.

Q. And indeed, Mr. Rubin, the gloves -- and I watched you put them on
-- you've even measured, pursuant to court order in the criminal
trial, Mr. Simpson's hands, haven't you?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. And Mr. Simpson's hands are considerably larger than yours, you
would agree?

A. They're larger than mine.

Q. The gloves are designed to be put on and then as you did, pushed
down between the fingers and to get a skin tight fit, true?

A. Yes.

Q. And those aren't gloves that come off very easily, are they, once
you get them skin tight and on a hand such as Mr. Simpson's -- and
let's put up number 641, if we may.

MR. P. BAKER: I have no idea what that is.

MR. KELLY: Your Honor, objection. I believe there's a question pending
right now that if we could have that read back, I believe there's a
question, no answer, we intend to request for an --

MR. BAKER: I'll withdraw it.

MR. KELLY: Thank you.

THE COURT: Take the lights down.

(Lights are lowered in courtroom.)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now looking at the glove, that glove appears tight;
is it not?

A. Across the knuckle area, yes.

Q. And that glove, to come off a human being such as -- well, strike
that.

In terms of your measurements, Mr. Simpson has a pretty wide palm,
does he not?

MR. KELLY: Objection to the form of the question.

THE COURT: Can't you get it better focused than that?

MR. KELLY: Objection was to the form, "pretty wide."

THE COURT: Rephrase it.

(Exhibit No. 641 is displayed.)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) I take it, in measuring the palm and the breadth of
Mr. Simpson's hand, you had measured others prior to the measurements
of Mr. Simpson, correct?

A. I've measured thousand of people's hands.

Q. In Mr. Simpson -- in terms of -- through the palm, that is the
width of the palm is relatively wide. You would agree?

A. Mr. Simpson's exact size is a -- is a perfect extra large in the
palm and a size large in the fingers.

Q. Well, in terms then of the width of his hand, the width, you say is
extra large as well as the meat, that is the breadth the between the
palm of his hand and the distal portion of his hand?

A. Gloves are measured across.

Q. Now, you have to answer my question.

A. He is a perfect, extra large across where you measure for size.

Q. And as I was attempting to ask you, sir, in terms of the size
across the palm, as well as across the back, how big is he, if you
measured?

A. Nine and a half on the left and nine and five eighths on the right
at that point in time.

Q. All right. And his hand is rather thick, is it not? That is the
area of the meat between the palm and the distal portion of the hand.

MR. KELLY: Objection as to the form of question, Judge.

THE COURT: What's wrong with it? I don't understand the objection.
Thick is -- thick isn't it --

MR. KELLY: Guess it's overruled then, right?

THE COURT: Yeah.

(Laughter.)

THE WITNESS: Mr. Simpson's hand is larger at the bottom compared to
proportion to where we measure a glove in the knuckle area.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) All right. And so once you would put these brown
gloves on, those are brown gloves that you see in photo 641, right?

A. They're a shade of brown.

Q. Those brown gloves in 641, which were a different shade than the
gloves you have in front of you. Would you agree with that?

A. I would.

Q. All right. So those aren't -- you're not suggesting those are the
same color when you suggested they were brown, were you?

A. I can't say that, because my experience is that gloves do darken
with age. And based upon the fact that there was lighting involved in
it, I stated prior that I will not make any speculations on color when
it comes to photographs or video.

Q. All right. So are you familiar with the Cincinnati Bengals uniforms
at all?

A. Yes.

Q. The colors that you see in Boomer Esiason's -- below his jacket.
Does that look authentic, like the Cincinnati Bengal's uniform? It's a
terrible question. I ask too many of those.

Let me -- You're familiar with their kind of -- their Bengal colors,
are you not?

Does this look like the Bengal colors?

MR. KELLY: Objection. Compound question. Lack of foundation, Judge.

THE COURT: He said he's familiar with them, overruled.

MR. KELLY: Oh.

THE WITNESS: It's in the same family of colors of the Bengal's
uniform.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) All right. And you don't have any indication that
the color that is indicated in that photo is the hue or anything in --
if that thing is off?

A. I wouldn't know one way or another.

Q. Okay.

Now, in terms of then putting on the gloves, this is the type of glove
that you have to pull on and then push the finger webbing down into
the hand, correct; cause it's a tight fitting, skin tight fitting
glove?

A. Each individual does it differently. But if you want to get it on
the best possible way, you'd have to gradually work your fingers into
the lining and pull the lining down a little bit.

The biggest problem with this glove, with this lining is you put your
hand in, there's a tendency to push the lining down into the fingers
which restricts the fit. So . . .

Q. Once you get the glove on, as you suggested earlier, it is
exceedingly skin tight. That's the design of it, right?

A. Yes.

Q. And so -- and that Mr. Simpson up there, that glove, whatever glove
it is, is tight on his hand. You would agree with that?

A. I would agree.

Q. All right?

A. Based upon the fact that his hand is cupped, that's what broadens
out the hand. That's what will make it appear tight.

Q. And to get that glove off, you're going to have to pull it off by
the finger tips, correct?

That's how the 70263 Aris leather light glove is made, is it not, so
it comes off hard and comes on hard so it looks sleek on the hand?

A. It shouldn't come off hard if your hand is straight.

Q. It's not going to fall off, is it?

A. It should not fall off.

Q. It's not going to fall off in two different locations, is it?

MR. KELLY: Objection. Argumentative, irrelevant, speculative.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Do you know if Mr. Simpson was ever known for
fumbling -- I'll withdraw the question.

MR. KELLY: Ask that the previous question be withdrawn. Also, there's
no answer to it.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, let's talk a little bit about the production of
these particular gloves. They were produced, you say, from 1983 to
1992 with the Brossar stitch, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. And they were sold at Bloomingdale's, that has 179 stores, correct?

A. They don't have -- to my knowledge, they do not have 179 stores.

Q. Did they have 179 stores in 1990?

A. They had 13 stores in 1990.

Q. Total? It's your testimony they had total of 13 stores in 1990?

A. Yes.

Q. What was the -- you seem to know specific numbers for 1990, the
production of these gloves, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. All right.

Now, tell me what the specific production of -- of the 70263 was in
1983?

A. I was asked that question. I estimate the production from '83 to
1988 and including the production of '89 for '90. I estimated there
were probably between 30- and 35,000 pairs made totally.

Q. Well, in 1989 -- for 1990, Bloomingdale's ordered 12,096 pairs, did
they not?

A. That -- they didn't order 12,000. I put 12,000 into production.
They ordered 10,000.

Q. So the 12, the 12,008 (sic) pairs was not the Bloomingdale's order
for 1990?

A. That was the -- that was the manufacturing order.

Q. Now, is it true -- well, strike that. What was the 1991 production?

A. I wasn't there.

Q. What was the 1992 production?

A. I was not there.

Q. What was the 1990 production?

A. A thousand dozen.

Q. I thought that was 1989 for sale in 1990?

A. No, no the production order was written probably in June of 1989
for production at the end of '89 and into 1990 for delivery into 1990.
So that in affect was the 1990 production.

Q. Okay.

What was the '89 production then?

A. Probably about 6,000 pair.

Q. How about '88, do we have an estimate of that, sir?

A. When I started with 1200 pair in '83 and I started graduating it up
based upon performance and it came to about 30, 35,000 pair total.

Q. Do you have an estimate of 1988 production, was the question. I
didn't ask you for history?

A. 4800 pair.

Q. And you don't know what colors were manufactured of those 30,
35,000 pairs, for example, in mean, do you?

A. Totally less than 5,000 pair.

Q. Now, that pair that you have in front of you is brown, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. The pair in 641 appears to be the color mean, does it not or does
it?

THE COURT: It's not up there.

MR. BAKER: Put it back up.

A. I'm really not sure what color it is. Otherwise it looks -- it's a
brownish shade. We had tremendous problems with brown. Every lot of
brown gloves that we produced, came out a different color. I've never
been able to be specific on the color, but it's in the brown family.

Q. Thanks so much.

(Exhibit 641 is displayed.)

Q. The glove you have in front of you are in the dark brown family,
aren't they?

A. These are in the brown family.

Q. The dark brown family as contrasted to the gloves in 641, which is
-- are not in the dark brown family?

A. They are dark brown now.

Q. All right. Tell me about the cuts that you know on those gloves.
You've done an inspection on those gloves, have you not?

A. I've seen them.

Q. And have you seen -- you've inspected them in detail, have you not?

A. Yes, I have.

Q. Tell me if there are any cuts over the left middle finger on the
left-hand glove which I believe is 129?

A. On the left hand, I do not see any cuts.

Q. Not a cut at all, correct?

A. Not on the left-hand glove.

Q. Okay.

I want you to inspect the palm. I want you to inspect every finger of
the glove and tell the jury whether or not there's any cuts on that
leather glove, Exhibit 129, whatsoever?

A. I do not see any.

Q. Okay.

Now, please look at Exhibit 204. That's the right-hand glove, sir.
Thank you. And tell me if you find any indication of a cut as
contrasted to a wear mark?

A. I don't think I'm qualified to tell the difference between a wear
mark and a cut.

Q. Well, then, we'll frame it a different way, if we can.

In terms of the indications on the palm of 204, the right-hand glove,
is there any indication that that's wear to you; or if you're not
qualified, just say so?

A. It doesn't appear as wear because it would -- if it was wear, it
would graduate like toward the weakness and tear a part, where it
seems to be just torn a part.

Q. Now, on the back of the glove is there any indication that a knife
may have been put in the glove up by the ribbons, those are petty,
pretty sharp, delineated lines on that glove, are they not?

A. I'm not qualified to answer that.

Q. Anything on the right thumb?

MR. KELLY: Objection. He's indicated he's not qualified to answer that
question, Your Honor.

THE COURT: I think he only asked anything on the right thumb.

MR. KELLY: It was a follow-up to the previous question that he
indicated.

THE COURT: Overruled.

MR. KELLY: Okay.

THE WITNESS: There's an opened cut mark of some sort on the thumb,
too.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Okay.

Now, did you -- when you inspected those gloves, did -- you looked at
the linings, did you not Mr. Rubin?

A. Yes.

Q. Did you know whether or not there was any appearance of anything
that appeared to be blood on the interior of the linings at all?

A. I wouldn't know it if I saw it.

Q. Was there any dark stains on the interior of the linings, Mr.
Rubin?

A. I did not see any.

Q. Did you see any stains at all on the lining?

A. I did not.

Q. Now, in the right-hand glove, there is an opening on the right
thumb, the back of the glove and two openings on the palm of the
glove, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. Now, did you have any discussions with anyone from the LADA's
office as to whether or not there had been any tests done to determine
if there was any blood on the linings of either of those gloves?

MR. KELLY: Objection. Calls for hearsay, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Sustained. Mr. Baker.

MR. BAKER: Thank you, sir.

THE COURT: 1:30, ladies and gentlemen. Don't talk about the case.
Don't form or express any opinions.

(At 11:58 A.M. a recess was taken until 1:35 P.M. of the same day.)


SANTA MONICA, CALIFORNIA
WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 6, 1996
1:35 P.M.

DEPARTMENT NO. WEQ
HON. HIROSHI FUJISAKI, JUDGE

(REGINA D. CHAVEZ, OFFICIAL REPORTER)

(Jurors resume their respective seats.)

RICHARD RUBIN, the witness on the stand at the time of the recess,
having been previously duly sworn, was examined and testified further
as follows:

THE COURT: You may proceed.

MR. BAKER: Thank you.

CROSS EXAMINATION (CONTINUED) BY MR. BAKER:

Q. Good afternoon, sir.

A. Good afternoon. Good afternoon.

Q. Did you tell me --

What -- did you get paid for your testimony in the District Attorney
-- From the DA's office in the criminal trial, sir?

MR. KELLY: Objection. Irrelevant.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: Not to this point.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Did you bill them, let me ask you that?

A. I filled out the form. I was never paid.

(Laughter.)

Q. You mean our tax dollars aren't being spent wisely?

Now, how much are you billing the plaintiffs' in this case?

A. I am not billing them anything.

Q. You're not charging anything?

A. No.

Q. And you became kind of enamored with the fact that you were
testifying in the criminal trial and wanted to keep some memorabilia
from that trial.

A. I don't believe I become enamored.

Q. Well, you suggested ways for the prosecution to get additional
evidence to convict my client, Mr. Simpson, did you not?

MR. KELLY: Objection. Hearsay, irrelevant, speculative, argumentative.

THE COURT: Overruled.

MR. BAKER: All known grounds.

THE WITNESS: Excuse me?

THE COURT: You may answer.

THE WITNESS: They asked me how they could find as much information as
possible regarding the gloves and what else was there regarding the
gloves.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) All right. So they asked you, regarding the gloves,
and you told them about -- this would be a new exhibit. This is your
correspondence of July 6, 1995, Mr. Rubin, is it not, sir?

MR. GELBLUM: We'll mark the document 2147 and the videotape as 2146.

(The instrument herein referred to Court TV videotape of glove
demonstration dated June 14, 1995 was marked for identification as
Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 2146.)

(The instrument herein referred to as correspondence from Richard
Rubin dated July 6, 1995 was marked for identification as Defendant's
Exhibit No. 2147.)

THE WITNESS: I'm familiar with this.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Okay.

Now, this letter is July 6 of '95, right?

A. That's correct.

Q. And that was before, of course, the defense had ever even started
putting on a defense in the case, right?

A. That's correct.

Q. And you say you're telling the D.A. there in your letter (reading):

As a point of reference, have all of the mens coats/jackets been
checked in the pockets in New York apartment and LA residence for a
second pair. It is highly probable that Mrs. Simpson bought one black,
one brown."

That's what you were telling -- giving advise to the district
attorney's office to do, correct?

A. That was actually in response to a question that was asked to me.

Q. I see. Was the next paragraph in response to a question that was
asked of you (reading):

"... If you should have any questions, please feel free to contact me
at any time. Please, thank everyone for their hospitality during my
visit. Maybe I can make it to the victory party!" Exclamation point.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Was that in response to a question, Mr. Rubin?

A. Actually the first two sentences are probably the end of every
letter I've dictated in my business career, but the last comment was
being gest.

Q. Gest about the victory party. You figured you did a pretty good job
for them and you were going to have a victory party as result of your
testimony in the case; isn't that true, sir?

A. Actually, I didn't think I did a very good job.

Q. I see. So you were just kidding around about the victory party for
the prosecution; is that right, sir?

A. As I said before I --

Q. Is that right?

A. It was in gest.

Q. Were you just kidding around?

A. Yes.

Q. And then you said, just kidding around.

(Reading):

"At your convenience, could you obtain business cards from all the
members of your staff as I want to make one and only one place or
piece for my office as memorabilia of my experience. Please include
Mr. Hodgman and Mrs. Clark."

Were you kidding around with that, sir?

A. No, I was not.

Q. Okay. You wanted all that. Did you ask for the cards of all the
lawyers representing all of the plaintiffs in this case?

A. They actually gave me their cards.

Q. You want mine?

A. If you like to give it to me, I'll take it.

Q. I don't think so.

(Laughter.)

Q. Now, relative to -- relative to the -- this morning, we took about
a 20 minute break and you were asked by the lawyers, specifically Mr.
Kelly, about the videotape with Mr. Simpson's and him trying on the
glove that didn't fit, right?

MR. PETROCELLI: Objection.

MR. KELLY: Objection. Argumentative, foundation, speculative, assumes
facts not in evidence.

THE COURT: I'll sustain the objection.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You asked -- Strike that.

You told Mr. Kelly that you could convince this jury, did you not,
that the gloves would have fit Mr. Simpson in the criminal trial if
you were allowed to go on the stand today in this case, true?

MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. There's no good faith basis to that
question at all.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) For 15 minutes, you were huddled right here at this
podium with Mr. Kelly, talking about the videotape of Mr. Simpson
trying on the gloves in the criminal trial, were you not, sir?

MR. KELLY: Objection, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: No, we were not.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You were here talking to Mr. Kelly how long about
the videotape of Mr. Simpson trying on the gloves in the criminal
trial?

A. Mr. Baker was not even aware that the tape would be shown when I
arrived here.

Q. I'm not talking about when you arrived here, sir. I was talking
about before, just immediately before you went on the witness stand,
you talked about the -- Mr. Kelly told you the judge ruled that tape
could be played and talked about the tape being played of Mr. Simpson
trying on the gloves, did you not, sir?

A. No, we did -- did not.

Q. Never touched on that at all?

A. Not today.

Q. When did you touch on it?

A. It was mentioned when I first arrived that the tape might
eventually get shown.

Q. And so you went over the fact that you could, in your mind --
Strike that. I have nothing further.

MR. KELLY: Can I have one moment, Judge?

REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. KELLY:

Q. Mr. Rubin, Mr. Baker had asked you to -- for an estimate of total
number of gloves manufactured by Aris. The Aris men's leather light,
between '83 and '89, you mentioned about 35,000 pairs; is that
correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. Did that number include gloves of every manufacturer make, size,
color, style, et cetera?

A. Every color, size within that style.

Q. Okay. That wasn't just the brown?

A. No, it was not.

Q. Okay. I have no further questions.

MR. BAKER: Nothing further.

THE COURT: Thank you. You're excused.

MR. PETROCELLI: Your Honor?

THE COURT: Yes.

MR. PETROCELLI: We have a two-hour and 50 plus minute videotape of the
deposition of Harry Scull, which we would like to play as plaintiffs'
next witness.

We can break it up as long as you would --

THE COURT: Two hours and what?

MR. PETROCELLI: 50.

THE COURT: Two hours and five zero?

MR. PETROCELLI: 47 minutes, Your Honor. The direct is very short, but
the cross-examination is somewhat extended.

THE COURT: Okay. You can run it 'till about 1:30, we'll take a break
-- 2:30, we'll take a break.

MR. PETROCELLI: Okay.

THE COURT: Okay.

MR. PETROCELLI: Thank you. I guess we should have the lights down.

(Recess.)

THE COURT: It's 2:30 and 3:30.

MR. PETROCELLI: 2:30 and 3:30.

THE COURT: Okay. Defense . . . Hello.

MR. BAKER: I'm sorry, sir.

THE COURT: Can we get a stipulation that the reporter does not have to
take down the testimony?

MR. BAKER: Yes, sir. No objection.

THE COURT: Thank you.

MR. PETROCELLI: I am proposing to have all the objections as to form
that appear on this video waived, deemed overruled so we don't have
you rule on that.

MR. BAKER: I'm not so willing. I can't remember what's on the video. I
didn't -- so I'm not willing to do that.

MR. PETROCELLI: As to form.

THE COURT: Would you -- unless you verbally state an objection live.

MR. BAKER: Okay. That's fair.

THE COURT: We'll deem it to be waived

MR. BAKER: That's totally fair. That means I have to stay in the room
for this.

THE COURT: Well, yes.

(Laughter.)

(The following proceedings were held in open court in the presence of
the jury:)

Q. In the event an objection is interjected, I'll stop the videotape.

(At 2:55 P.M., the videotaped deposition of Harry Scull was played.)

THE COURT: Okay. Take a ten minute recess, ladies and gentlemen.

(The tape was stopped and a recess Taken.)

(Jurors exit courtroom.)

(The following proceedings were held in open court outside the
presence of the jury.)

THE COURT: Jurors left the court room. Counsel, do we have to listen
to three hours of this?

MR. PETROCELLI: The direct is only about ten more minutes.

THE COURT: You know, if there are future videos, I would strongly
recommend that counsel get together and try to limit the video
testimony to something that's essential.

I mean, who cares how many rolls he's got or what the sequence of the
contact prints are, you know.

MR. PETROCELLI: In this case, Your Honor, their contention is the
picture is not authentic. That's why he was taken through the steps on
that. That was the only reason.

MR. KELLY: There's only a couple minutes left.

THE COURT: We're on page 29 and the direct goes to page 35.

All right. I'm just saying. It's really difficult to find it very
productive:

THE BAILIFF: We're in recess.

(Jurors resume their respective seats.)

(The following proceedings were held in open court, in the presence of
the jury.)

THE COURT: Okay. How are we proceeding?

MR. PETROCELLI: We have ten more minutes of direct on the video, and
then the defense, in lieu of playing the video, has agreed to read
some passages from their cross-examination, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Okay. You may proceed.

MR. PETROCELLI: Thank you. (Videotaped Deposition of Harry Scull
resumes playing.)

MR. KELLY: Your Honor, before we start the cross-examination, I'd like
to put the exhibits up on the Elmo quickly and move them into
evidence.

THE COURT: All right.

MR. KELLY: First of all, I'd like to do Deposition Exhibits 1, 3, 4,
5, and 6 that are cumulative, my Exhibit 724.

If we can put them on one at a time quickly, Steve.

(Mr. Foster displays series of photographs taken by freelance
photographer Harry Scull on September 26, 1993.)

MR. KELLY: That's Exhibit 1.

That's Trial Exhibit 724, also.

724, also, a series of photos.

Can you zoom in a little bit, Steve. Zoom in on that a little bit.

For example, can you do a large shot of the whole contact sheet once
more?

And can you put the rest of 724 up there.

And the large shot again.

And 1931, please.

And could you go back to the first shoe one more time.

I ask that they all be moved into evidence.

THE COURT: That's 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6?

MR. KELLY: 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6, cumulatively, our Exhibit 724.

And Deposition Exhibit No. 2 would be Exhibit 1931.

THE COURT: Okay.

MR. KELLY: Thank you.

(The instruments herein collectively referred to as a series of
photographs taken by freelance photographer Harry Scull, taken on
September 26, 1993, were marked for identification as Plaintiffs'
Exhibit No. 724.)

THE COURT: Proceed.

MR. KELLY: Thank you.

MR. LEONARD: May we, Your Honor?

Mr. Baker -- Mr. Baker Junior will play the part of Mr. Scull, Senior.

You set, Mr. Scull?

MR. P. BAKER: Yep.

photograph almost everything and then process and print the film -- or
process and print the film in-house.

MR. LEONARD: Okay. Line over to page 39, line 3. (Reading:)

"Q. Okay. Now, by the way, on 9/26/93, did the Associated Press pick
out any of our photos to use?

"A. I don't recall.

"A. I don't recall.

"Q. Do you remember if there was any wind before the game?

"A. I don't recall that either.

"Q. Do you remember whether or not the temperature was in excess of 50
degrees?

"A. Yes, it was.

"Q. And would that be throughout the period of the game it was in
excess of 50 degrees, you believe?

"A. I don't recall that.

"Q. Now, do you have all of the photos that you took on September 26,
1993 here today?

"A. No.

"MR. BAKER: Mr. O'Connor, why not?

"MR. O'CONNOR: Ask the witness. I have certain photographs that he

(Reading:)

"Q. Did you try to market that photograph to anybody other than the
National Enquirer?

"A. Yes.

"Q. And who did you try to market it to?

sense.

"Q. Well, Exhibit number 1, did you try to sell that picture to
anybody?

"A. No.

"Q. Well, what did -- what is your relationship to Gamma-Liaison?

"A. There is no --

"MR. O'CONNOR: Object to the form. You can answer.

"THE WITNESS: There is no relationship.

"MR. BAKER: Is it your testimony that you received absolutely no
remuneration for that photograph appearing in National Enquirer?

"MR. O'CONNOR: Object to the form. That's not the question that you
asked of him. You can answer the question.

"THE WITNESS: Would you rephrase it, please.

"MR. BAKER: Is it your testimony that you received absolutely nothing
of value for the photograph appearing in the National Enquirer that is
Exhibit 1 to today's deposition?

"MR. O'CONNOR: Form. You can answer?

"THE WITNESS: No.

"MR. BAKER: Okay. What did you receive of value for that photograph
appearing in National Enquirer?

"THE WITNESS: Myself, $2500.

"MR. BAKER: What else was received by anybody as a result of that
photograph appearing in National Enquirer?

"MR. O'CONNOR: Form. You can answer.

MR. BAKER: I don't think have you to read that, in view of the
stipulation.

MR. LEONARD: Okay.

(Continued reading as follows:)

"Q. When did he ask you if he could act as your agent?

"A. I received a phone call from him on March 28 of 1996.

"Q. Now, did -- between September 26 and March 20 -- strike that.
"Between September 26, 1993 and March 28, 1996, did you tell anybody
you had this photograph that was Exhibit 1?

"A. Would you rephrase that question again, please,

"MR. BAKER: Would you read the question back."

"THE WITNESS: Yes."

(Continued reading as follows:)

"Q. Okay. And who did you tell?

"A. The National Enquirer.

"Q. When did you tell the National Enquirer?

"A. Approximately June of 1995.

"Q. Did you tell anyone or any other entity between September 26, 1993
and June of 1995, you had the image that has become photograph Exhibit
number 1?

"A. No.

"Q. Why not?

"A. I didn't --"

(Continued reading as follows:)

"Q. You can answer the question, Mr. Scull.

THE WITNESS: "Would you rephrase it or repeat it, please."

MR. BAKER: "The question was, why not?"

THE WITNESS: "I didn't think it was of any value."

MR. BAKER: "Now, did you tell anyone else before March of 1996, or any
other entity. That you had the image that has become Exhibit 1?"

MR. LEONARD: Line 7.

(Reading:)

"A. Not to my recollection."

(Continued reading as follows:)

"Q. Did you talk to anybody?"

A. "Yes. Rob McCelroy. I thought that was already stated."

Q. "Okay. Now, in June of 1995, you thought the picture had some value
when you went to the National Enquirer, correct?"

A. "Yeah."

MR. BAKER: "You can answer the question, Mr. Scull"

A. "No."

Q. "When you contacted the National Enquirer in June of 1995, you
thought the image had some value, true?"

A. "Yes."

"Q. And you had contacted Mr. McCelroy by June of 1995, or did you
directly communicate with the National Enquirer?

"A. I directly communicated with the National Enquirer.

"Q. And at that time did you provide them with the negative of the
image that has been come Exhibit No. 1?

"A. Nope.

"Q. Why not?

"A. In my conversations" --

MR. KELLY: Objection. Hearsay.

I'll withdraw the objection, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Okay.

MR. LEONARD: (Continued reading as follows:)

A. "In my conversations with them, they were 'O.J.'d out' and didn't
want to see anything."

Q. "It's your testimony, in June of 1995, the National Enquirer told
you they were 'O.J.'d out;' is that correct?"

A. "Yeah."

Q. "Who was that?"

A. "Ray."

Q. "Who said -- who said that to you from the National Enquirer?"

"A. Ray Ferrall."

"Q. Did you then attempt to communicate with any other of the tabloids
to sell the image that has become Exhibit number 1?

"A. No.

"Q. Now, why in June of 1995 did you feel the image had value?

"A. I just had a head-to-toe picture of O.J. Simpson, and I hadn't
seen any to that point.

"I hadn't seen any photographs at that point.

"Q. Now, it's your testimony that the image that has become Exhibit
number 1 in this deposition was taken by you on September 26, 1993,
correct?

"A. Correct.

"Q. And it's your testimony that that was taken with your Canon
camera, correct?

"A. Yes, sir.

"Q. At what lens did you have on your Canon camera?

"A. A 500 millimeter lens.

"Q. That's the 4.5 500-millimeter lens?

"A. Yes, sir.

"Q. Who was the manufacturer of the optics?

"A. Canon.

"Q. Now at that point in time when you took the photograph, you were
standing where?

"A. In the end zone.

"Q. Where in the end zone?

"A. Along the goal line.

"Q. And on which -- you said you were on the Miami side of the field;
is that correct?

"A. It appears to be, yes.

"Q. And the Miami side of the field is -- we have got a picture of
Rich Stadium up there behind Mr. Petrocelli. Orient me, if you can,
sir to north, south, east and west.

"A. Well, I'm not --"

MR. LEONARD: I'm going to skip over now to page 54, line 3:

(Continued reading as follows:)

"Q. And Mr. Simpson was where?

"A. I believe by the -- around the -- near the Ls in Bills.

"Q. And as -- that would be --

"A. It would be in the middle of the two Ls.

"Q. All right. And you were standing?

"A. Yes.

"Q. And the viewfinder was at your eye level, correct?

"A. Slightly lower.

"Q. Why was the viewfinder slightly lower than your eye?

"A. Because the -- the monopad won't reach a six foot one -- won't
reach when it's fully extended, to my eye.

"Q. So you're six foot one, correct?

"A. Yes.

"Q. And you have a monopod that you put the camera on and shoot
because of the 500 millimeter telephoto; is that correct?

"A. Correct.

"Q. All right. And approximately how tall is the monopod fully
extended?

"A. I would say five foot.

"Q. You still have that monopod?

"A. Yes.

"Q. Now, what was the speed of the film you were using?

"A. 400.

"Q. Fuji?

"A. Yes.

"Q. And that's the same film you used all day --

"A. No.

"Q. -- correct? "What film -- what other speed film did you use that
day?

"A. I used some 1600. 1600.

"Q. Why did you change from 400 to 1600?

"A. Because approximately 1:05 it started to rain and the light
changed. The light diminished and I needed a higher speed film.

"Q. Now, it's your testimony it hadn't been raining until 1:05; is
that correct?

"A. Approximately, yes."

MR. LEONARD: Skipping over to page 57, line 5:

(Continued reading as follows:)

"Q. You do recall it was sunny at the time you took it?

"A. Yes.

"Q. And approximately what time do you think you took that photograph?

"A. Approximately 12:15.

"Q. Okay. And you don't recall any wind that day?

"A. No.

"Q. And you don't recall what the temperature was, except it was in
excess of 50 degrees, correct?

"A. To the best of my recollection, no.

"Q. Do you recall if it was in excess of 60 degrees at the time you
took the photograph?

"A. To the best of my recollection, no.

"Q. Somewhere between 50 and 60?

"A. To the best of my recollection, no.

"Q. What do you mean, no? Do you know what it was or do you not know
what it was? That is, the temperature.

"A. To the best of my recollection, I don't remember.

"Q. You don't have any recollection of what the temperature was on
September 26, 1993?

"A. I can tell you it didn't snow.

"Q. But you don't know, for example, were you wearing a coat that day
when you took that photograph?

"A. Yes.

"Q. What kind of coat were you wearing?

"A. I don't recall.

"Q. Do you usually wear a vest when you take pictures?

"A. Yes.

"Q. Were you wearing a vest?

"A. It's possible.

"Q. You don't have a recollection?

"A. No.

"Q. Do you recall then that you were, or do you have no recollection
whether you were wearing a coat or not?

"A. I was wearing a --"

(Continued reading as follows:)

Q. "You can answer the question Mr. Scull."

(Continued reading as follows:)

"Do you have a recollection, as you sit here today, that you were
wearing a coat on September --

"A. Yes, I do.

"Q. -- 6, 1993?"

(Continued reading as follows:)

"Was it a coat that was a down coat with quilting in it?"

(Continued reading as follows:)

"No. "Was it a down coat?" "To the best of my recollection, I don't
remember."

Q. "Now, when did you first meet with Mr. Kelly?"

(Continued reading as follows:)

"You can answer the question, Mr. Scull."

MR. PETROCELLI: Mr. Leonard, since you're deleting the objections, I
think you should delete the "you can answer the question," as well.

MR. LEONARD: Okay.

MR. PETROCELLI: Thank you.

MR. LEONARD: If you go over -- a little complicated -- over to line 6.

MR. P. BAKER: Yeah.

(Continued reading as follows:)

"Last night."

"Q. What time did you meet with him?

"A. Approximately 5:15.

"Q. Where did you meet with him?

"A. Mr. O'Connor's office.

"Q. How long were you there --

"A. Approximately --

MR. LEONARD: Over to 79, line 7.

MR. P. BAKER: Okay.

(Continued reading as follows:)

"Q. Now, in terms of your photograph, that's the image that's become
Exhibit 1, you were outside the yellow line in the end zone when that
picture was taken; is that correct?

"A. Correct. I didn't know if you wanted to --

"Q. Yeah, fine. Why don't you put that up. Do you know how wide the
football field is? Because I sure don't.

"A. No. 40 some -- 40 some yards, I believe.

"Q. So you were approximately 20 yards away from Mr. Simpson at the
time the photograph was taken?"

(Continued reading as follows:)

A. "I believe a little further."

Q. "Okay. 25 yards?"

A. "I don't know."

"MR. O'CONNOR: If you can -- If you can approximate, approximate" --

MR. LEONARD: Excuse me.

(Continued reading as follows:)

"Q. Yeah. If you have an estimate, just give it to me. If it was about
20, 25 yards?

"A. Approximately 30 yards.

"Q. If the football field's 40 yards wide -- and I'll take your word
for it because I don't know -- was he between, for example, the tunnel
and the right-hand sideline, as you see it in that picture?

"A. No. He was between the two Ls.

"Q. Okay. Which would be more centered than off to the right-hand side
of that photograph, correct?

"A. Correct.

"Q. All right. And so if that field is 25 -- strike that. If the field
is 40 yards wide, the first L would be approximately the middle, as I
-- at least as I see it from this angle, right? Almost adjacent to the
tunnel?

"A. Yes.

"Q. All right. And so it would be within 20, 25 yards of where you
were taking the photograph, correct?

"A. Yes.

"Q. And you were outside the -- okay.

"A. Yellow line that runs --

"Q. That runs perpendicular to the sidelines, correct?

"A. Correct.

"Q. All right. And at the goal line, true?

"A. Yes.

"Q. Okay. Now, the field's made of Astroturf, is it not, at Rich
Stadium?

"A. Yes.

"Q. And when you walk around at the stadium, you pick up the debris
that comes off the Astroturf on your shoes, do you not?"

(Continued reading as follows:)

"You can."

Q. "And I want you to look at Exhibit 1 and tell me if you see any
debris on Mr. Simpson's shoes that's consistent with the debris that
comes from the Astroturf that you're familiar with."

(Continued reading as follows:)

A. "No."

Q. "Do you know if Mr. McCelroy is familiar with darkroom techniques
including, for example, masking?"

A. "I don't know."

MR. LEONARD: Good news is, we've got a lot to skip. So ...

Okay. Page 93, line 14.

MR. P. BAKER: Okay.

(Continued reading as follows:)

"Q. Now, in terms of your recollection, was it sunny up until
approximately, say, 1:05, when it started raining?

"A. Absolutely.

Q. "Okay. And when at 1:05 then it became overcast -- excuse me.
"Okay. And then at 1:05 then it became overcast and commenced raining?

"A. Yeah. A front moved in.

"Q. Now, how do you remember precisely 1:05, sir?

"A. Well, because I remember that the national anthem had ended, they
got ready for the kickoff, and the light changed drastically at that
point and part of my images were a little underexposed because the 4.5
millimeter lens didn't stop down enough or didn't open up enough.

"Q. And at that time, did you change cameras, or did you change the
lens on your camera body?

"A. I had to change film.

"Q. Okay. So you changed films and continued to use the 500, 4.5 lens?

"A. Yes.

"Q. And that's manufactured by Canon, correct?

"A. Correct.

"Q. All right. Now, in terms of from the time you got there at 9:30,
it was sunny up until 1:05, right?

"A. To the best of my recollection, yes.

"Q. Okay. Did you ever ask Mr. McCelroy if he had done anything to the
negative while it was in his possession?

"A. Yes.

"Q. And he told you what?"

(Continued reading as follows:)

A. "No."

Q. "And he had it in his possession approximately six weeks?"

A. "I don't recall."

"Q. All right. Now, in terms of Mr. McCelroy having it in his
possession, did you ask for it back?

"A. Yes.

"Q. Okay. And did he return then all of the negatives, as far as you
know, that you gave him in the acetate sleeve?

"A. Yes.

"Q. All right. And did he tell you what he had done with them, if
anything, during the time period that he had those negatives?"

(Continued reading as follows:)

A. "Yes."

Q. "Why don't you answer that and we'll --"

A. Yes. I gave the negatives to Mr. McCelroy. He -- Mr. McCelroy -- in
turn, made some prints. The prints were sent along with the negatives
to the National Enquirer. From the National Enquirer, the negatives
went to Gamma-Liaison in London. Mr. McCelroy flew to New York City to
pick the negatives up from the Concord on a return trip. Mr. McCelroy
-- Mr. McCelroy delivered -- or hand carried, delivered the negatives
to the Rochester Institute of Technology where the photo experts
examined the negative there. And from there, I picked up the
negatives."

MR. LEONARD: Down to line 19.

(Continued reading as follows:)

"From that point on, I picked them up. When Mr. McCelroy arrived home
the next day, I picked those negatives up."

Q. "So it was your understanding that the negatives left the country
and went to London?"

A. "Correct."

Q. "And how long were they in London?"

A. "I believe two days."

MR. LEONARD: Down to line 14 on page 97.

(Continued reading as follows:)

"MR. BAKER: Mr. Scull, did you ever take a similar photo of Mr.
Simpson as is -- similar to as is depicted in Exhibit 1?"

(Continued reading as follows:)

"THE WITNESS: Not to the best of my recollection."

Q. "So that would be the only photo that you're aware of that shows
Mr. Simpson from head to toe, including his feet, that you have ever
taken in the years that you have been photographing at Rich Stadium?"

A. "Yes."

THE COURT: Mr. Leonard.

MR. LEONARD: Yes?

THE COURT: (Motions for counsel to come to sidebar.)

(Proceedings were held at the bench, without the reporter.) (The
following proceedings were held in open court, in the presence of the
jury.)

MR. LEONARD: Pick it up.

(Laughter.)

MR. LEONARD: Okay. Over to page 100, line 3.

MR. P. BAKER: Okay.

(Continued reading as follows:)

"Q. All right. Now, to your knowledge, were the negatives that you
have displayed to us here today ever duplicated?

"A. No.

"Q. And you know of no reason why those negatives would have been
duplicated if, in fact, they ever were, correct?

"A. Correct.

"Q. And do you know why the negatives went to London?

"A. Yes.

"Q. Tell me.

"A. Gamma-Liaison scanned it in the computer.

"Q. And do you know why Gamma-Liaison scanned the negatives into a
computer?

(Continued reading as follows:)

A. "For possible sales."

Q. "Well, explain to me who told you that Gamma-Liaison scanned this
photograph into a computer."

A. "Rob McCelroy."

Q. "And when you discussed this with Mr. McCelroy, did he tell you why
they needed to scan it into a computer?"

transaction of selling the photograph to National Enquirer?"

A. "To -- my recollection indicates that Gamma-Liaison was not
involved whatsoever in the sale."

"Q. Well, did the negatives go to Gamma-Liaison before the photograph
was printed in National Enquirer?

"A. No.

"Q. The photograph indicates in the National Enquirer that it is
copyrighted by Gamma-Liaison, does it not?

"A. Correct.

"Q. And is it your testimony that the photograph was copyrighted by
Gamma-Liaison before they had ever seen the negative?

"A. I don't -- I can't answer that. I don't know.

"Q. You just testified, unless I misunderstood, that the photograph
went to Gamma-Liaison; that is, the negative, the C-41 negative, went
to Gamma-Liaison after the photograph had been published in the
National Enquirer, correct?

"A. Correct.

"Q. How do you know that?

"A. I was told by Rob McCelroy.

"Q. Well, what did Rob McCelroy tell you relative to Gamma-Liaison and
why, after it had been published, it needed to go to London to be
scanned into a computer?

"A. It was their headquarters.

"Q. Well, how did he tell you Gamma-Liaison was involved at all in
this photograph being published in the National Enquirer?

"A. Gamma-Liaison Credit was used to, A, protect my identity and to
let other possible sources know that they had the image on file.

"Q. Well, why did you want to protect your identity, Mr. Scull?

"A. Because I just don't want my life interrupted. I wasn't ready to
be besieged by the media and everyone.

"Q. Well, you wanted to sell this photograph, did you not?

"A. Correct.

"Q. And you wanted the photograph to be published, did you not?

"A. Correct.

(Continued reading as follows:)

Q. "And when was it that Mr. Kelly and your attorney, if you know,
communicated?"

"Q. Did you direct your attorney to -- strike that. "Did you want to
communicate with Mr. Kelly relative to this particular photograph, Mr.
Scull?

"A. Yes.

"Q. Why?

"A. I wanted to -- I wanted to -- if this indeed was true, I wanted to
be able to help out in whatever way I could.

"Q. And when did you decide you wanted to communicate with Mr. Kelly?

"A. I was probably -- "

(Continued reading as follows:)

"Q. Now, did you ever communicate with Mr. Kelly before last night?

"A. Yes.

"Q. Okay. Now, tell me when the first time was you communicated with
Mr. Kelly.

"A. To the best of my recollection, shortly after my attorney had
contacted him.

"Q. Was that a telephone communication you had with Mr. Kelly?

"A. Yes.

"Q. So you changed your mind? You didn't care if you were besieged by
photographers? You wanted to, in your words, help out if you could,
right?"

(Continued reading as follows:)

"Would you repeat it, please."

MR. LEONARD: Question is reread.

(Continued reading as follows:)

"We talked about at that time, I wasn't voluntarily willing to go
forward with my name."

Q. "Now, as I understand it, in May -- strike that -- in April of
1996, you did not want to reveal your identity relative to this
photograph, correct?"

MR. KELLY: Page 66.

MR. LEONARD: Your Honor, can we approach?

THE COURT: Sure.

MR. LEONARD: Yes.

(The following proceedings were held at the bench, with the reporter:)

MR. LEONARD: It appears that Mr. Kelly is going to go back and try to
read portions of the cross-examination.

I don't think that's appropriate. They had an opportunity to get into
redirect. I don't think it's appropriate for him to read
cross-examination.

MR. PETROCELLI: Excuse me. First of all, I don't know of any such rule
of law. We're reading deposition transcripts two at a time.

I designated -- they directly informed me, Your Honor, that they were
doing the entire cross, so I had no way of knowing that they were
going to pick and choose. So we now want to read some portions that
they omitted on cross-examination.

THE COURT: Okay. I'll allow it.

MR. PETROCELLI: Thank you.

MR. LEONARD: Can I have that reference again?

MR. KELLY: Page 66, line 9.

MR. P. BAKER: Okay.

pictures.

"Q. For what?

(Continued reading as follows:)

A. "I went through the images or the negatives from the entire day to
print black and white panalor images."

Question from Mr. Petrocelli: "What's 'panalor' mean?"

A. "It's -- Panalor is the photographic paper in which you can print a
black and white image from a color negative."

"Q. Why did you want to do this?

"A. To send to Pro Football Weekly.

"Q. And how many of the photos -- strike that. "How many of the images
did you send to Pro Football Weekly?"

"A. Approximately 15 to 20.

"Q. And none of those included Mr. Simpson, correct?"

(Continued reading as follows:)

A. "Yes, they did include Mr. Simpson.

"Q. Now, which of the images did you send to Pro Football Weekly that
included Mr. Simpson?

"A. I don't recall all of them. I recall some of them but not all of
them."

MR. KELLY: Okay. Skipping over to page 84.

MR. P. BAKER: Okay.

MR. KELLY: Line number 7.

MR. P. BAKER: Okay.

(Continued reading as follows:)

Q. "All right. Now, which images did you sell to Football Weekly of
the 9/26/93 game?"

(Continued reading as follows:)

made up.

"Q. Why is it that you sent an image of Mr. Simpson to Pro Football
Weekly a week after the September 26, 1993 game?

"A. Mr. Simpson's a former NFL player, part of the national media, and
his photograph can be aired at any time regarding anything.

"Q. Which image did you send to pro football weekly of Mr. Simpson, if
you can recall, of the contact sheets you have in front of you?

number 5.

"Q. The same one that has appeared in -- which you say is unaltered,
that appeared in the National Enquirer on April 23, 1996?"

MR. KELLY: Okay. Skipping over to page 86, line 19.

(Continued reading as follows:)

"Q. Did you ever contact anybody from Pro Football Weekly to see if
they retained any of the photos that you sent them back in September
of 1993?

"A. Yes.

"Q. When did you contact them?

"A. Last week.

"Q. And why?

"A. I just wanted to find out if they had a copy of this from that
day."

(Continued reading as follows:)

"Q. Now, who did you contact at Pro Football Weekly?

"A. Bob Peters.

"Q. Did Mr. Peters tell you they had retained a photo that is Exhibit
No. 1?

"A. Yes, yes.

"Q. They still have it?

MR. LEONARD: Over to 89, 2?

MR. KELLY: 89, 2. "Now, why did you want the picture back from Pro
Football Weekly that you say is identical to Exhibit number 1?"

A. "I didn't ask for the picture back."

Q. "Did you ask -- what did you ask for back from Pro Football
Weekly?"

A. "Absolutely nothing."

"Q. Why were you interested if Pro Football Weekly retained that
photograph, Mr. Scull?

"A. Because I didn't want it published without my permission.

"Q. Did you make any arrangements with Mr. Bob Peters of Pro Football
Weekly to get the photograph returned to you?

"A. No."

MR. KELLY: Okay. Page 108.

MR. P. BAKER: Okay.

MR. KELLY: "Let me see if you can answer my question."

Actually, strike that. We covered this --

MR. LEONARD: Yeah.

MR. KELLY: -- Already. I'm sorry.

Page 110.

MR. P. BAKER: Okay.

MR. KELLY: Line 17.

MR. P. BAKER: Okay.

(Continued reading as follows:)

Q. "Who was the gentleman you spoke to at Pro Football Weekly?"

A. "Bob --"

(Continued reading as follows:)

A. "Bob Peters."

"Q. Tell me everything that you recall about that conversation.

his file on Mr. Simpson to see if, indeed, he still had the photograph
that I had sent him.

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Hearsay.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. KELLY: Line 16.

(Continued reading as follows:)

"Q. And did Mr. Peters indicate to you that he would keep the photo in
safekeeping?"

MR. LEONARD: Same objection.

MR. P. BAKER: Okay.

(Continued reading as follows:)

EXAMINATION BY MR. PETROCELLI:

"Q. All of the negatives that you have produced here today are the
ones that remain in your possession that contain images of O.J.
Simpson?

"A. Yes.

MR. PETROCELLI: 132 starting at line 22.

(Pause for the Court to read transcript.)

THE COURT: What's the objection?

MR. LEONARD: Your Honor, I think it's hearsay and it's not admissible.
This is a statement made out of court; it's not relevant.

THE COURT: What problems --

MR. PETROCELLI: Either admissions go directly to that claim that this
picture is being used.

THE COURT: Overruled.

MR. LEONARD: Go ahead; knock yourself out.

(The following proceedings were held in open court, in the presence of

took that has been marked here as Exhibit 1 is not a legitimate
picture that, it is doctored?

"A. Correct. Yes.

that?

"A. Correct."

(Continued reading as follows:)

"Q. Is that true?

"A. Yes.

"Q. That you have heard that, correct?

Would you please state and spell your name for the record.

THE WITNESS: Robert Huizenga, R-O-B-E-R-T H-U-I-Z-E-N-G-A.

DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q. Good morning, Doctor.

A. Morning.

Q. You and I don't know each other, do we?

A. No, we don't.

Q. We just met this morning in the men's room, right?

A. That's correct.

(Laughter.)

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) You're a licensed physician?

A. Yes, I am.

Q. What is -- you're an internist, right?

A. Yes, I am.

Q. Okay. Now, you were requested by Mr. Simpson's lawyer, Robert
Shapiro, in the criminal action, to consult with O.J. Simpson on June
15, 1994 correct?

A. That is correct.

Q. And Mr. Shapiro is a patient of your partner, right?

A. That is correct.

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Hearsay; lack of relevance.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) He's a friend of yours, also?

A. No, he's not.

Q. Social acquaintance?

A. I wouldn't say he's a social acquaintance.

Q. In any event, Mr. Simpson was brought to your office on the 15th of
June and you examined him, correct?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. And you then examined him on the 17th of June, two days later,
correct?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. 1994, right.

Now, the examination on the 15th occurred at your office, right?

A. Yes, it did.

Q. And the examination on June 17th occurred at the home of Robert
Kardashian, a friend of Mr. Simpson's, right?

A. That is correct.

Q. And at the time that you were from -- with Mr. Simpson, there were
a number of other folks present, as well, right?

A. That is correct.

Q. People involved with -- involved with Mr. Simpson's criminal
defense team, correct?

A. That is correct.

Q. Dr. Michael Baden, a forensic pathologist, was there, right?

A. Yes, he was.

Q. Dr. Henry Lee, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. And a lot of lawyers, right?

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Vague and leading.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: A lot of lawyers.

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Okay.

Now, you took some photographs of Mr. Simpson on the 15th, correct?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Did you also take some on the 17th, right?

A. No, I did not.

Q. But you saw others taking photographs on the 17th right?

A. That is correct.

Q. Okay. Just to simplify this, let me show you what has been marked
as --

MR. PETROCELLI: May I approach, Your Honor?

THE COURT: You may.

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) -- Exhibits 714 and 715.

And what they are collectively, are photographs from the June 15 and
June 17 -- the first group are photographs of the fingers and hands;
the second group are photographs of the rest of Mr. Simpson's body.

And I'd just like you to authenticate that those indeed are the
photographs that you took or saw being taken.

A. This is a combination of the pictures that were taken on the 15th
and the 17th.

Q. And you want to just take a quick look at the ones in it, the
notebook, as well, just to make sure?

MR. LEONARD: Your Honor, we offered to stipulate those are the
photographs.

MR. PETROCELLI: Okay. They've stipulated. There's no further need for
you to look at these.

You want to put these back in order and put them up on the Elmo?

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Now, on the 15th and on the 17th, you made
observations about the -- about the physical condition of Mr.
Simpson's hands, right?

A. That is correct.

Q. Is it fair to say that no material change had occurred in his hands
between the 15th and the th, correct?

A. There was subtle healing, but no material changes had occurred in
those two days.

Q. No new injuries or marks, correct?

A. There were no new injuries on the hands.

Q. So when asking the questions about the marks and injuries on the
hands, you refer to your observations both on the 15th and the 17th;
that would be fair, right?

A. That would be fair, in my opinion.

Q. Okay.

This way, I don't have to do each one separately.

Okay. We can speed it up a little bit.

Let me show you what we will mark as the next exhibit in order.

THE CLERK: 2148.

MR. PETROCELLI: Which will be 2148.

(The instrument herein referred to as diagram left hand drawn by
Robert Huzienga dated 6/15/94 was marked for identification as
Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 2148.)

MR. PETROCELLI: See if this will show up on the Elmo.

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) First, let me show it to you. And why don't you
identify it for the record.

A. This was the diagram that I drew initially, when I saw him on the
15th, of his left hand.

Q. And it is a diagram with notes on it, correct?

A. Yes, it is.

Q. And the notes describe injuries to his left hand, correct?

A. That is correct.

Q. Okay.

I can't read your writing, Doctor.

I guess that's not unusual.

I think you'll have to translate for us.

MR. PETROCELLI: Steve will that show on the Elmo?

You want to give it a shot?

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Can you walk us through those injuries?

That pointer opens up too.

MR. PETROCELLI: It might be easier, maybe, if you can move beside the
television and the jurors can see a little bit better, over to that
end or that end.

Can you all see?

JURORS: Um-hum.

THE COURT: Thank you.

THE WITNESS: That's a laceration.

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Speak up, Doctor.

A. You would like me to describe each --

Q. Yeah.

A. -- laceration initially, or --

Q. You -- the two days combined, you observed three cuts or
lacerations on Mr. Simpson's hand; is that correct.

Left hand?

A. Left hand; that is correct.

Q. And you observed seven abrasions, correct?

A. On his left hand; that is correct.

Q. So three cuts and seven abrasions on the left hand, right?

A. Correct.

Q. And on the right hand, you observed one cut, correct?

A. That is correct.

Q. Okay. So a total of eleven on both hands?

A. Correct.

Q. Can you -- now, this is the left hand. And could you please
describe what your observations were.

MR. PETROCELLI: You might try zooming in.

THE WITNESS: On the fourth finger, we call this here, would be his --
approximately where the fingernail ends; and he had just under the
fingernail, what we call the distal interphalangeal joint, on the left
fourth finger, on the medial -- the inside side, he had a -- the
beginning of a relatively easily sloped U-shape laceration that
extended from that distal interphalangeal joint to the proximal
interphalangeal joint.

And the initial half of it -- this was approximately a
two-and-a-half-centimeter laceration -- the initial half of that, the
initial centimeter and a quarter, was a very superficial laceration,
and then it went to a slightly deeper, but actually more of an
avulsion-type laceration, or the more proximal half of that lesion.

This initial portion appeared to have a point of entry something like
90 degrees to the plane of the hand. If this is the plane of the hand
(indicating), there seemed to be a flap-type of injury, so that the
injury seemed to be coming from 90 degrees in this direction and
parallel to the access of the fingers. So it appeared to be an area
right here, where you had this very thin, very small, serrated,
undulating edge flap here.

There was no flap or no indication at all it was a small, avulsed
segment. It wasn't necessarily a laceration, where you can take the
wound and slap both edges together. There was a tiny piece of skin
missing.

The second laceration was a relatively small, half of a centimeter or
three-eighths of an inch, semicircular laceration that appeared, when
you matched the hands together, to almost come contiguous with this
other injury.

This, on my initial evaluation on the 15th, was still open. There
wasn't necessarily a closure of that, but it was very superficial. It
looked like, kind of, you could call it a bad paper cut.

This was the smoothest of the injuries. And it appeared that the --
that the cut came something more in this direction to the plane of the
hand, so that it was more in, say, a 20-degree angle where this seemed
to have been cut open. And then the point of entry seemed to be,
instead of parallel, it seemed to have been coming in this direction,
perpendicular, actually, to the finger.

And the third laceration was a fishhook-type laceration that was
immediately over his left third proximal interphalangeal joint, this
proximal finger joint. And it was, if I remember correctly,
approximately a bit over a centimeter, to a centimeter and a half,
which would be something like a bit under a half of an inch. And it
had an angulated, almost fishhook appearance if you looked at it
coming from the other direction.

And there did appear to be a little bit more of a sharp angle right
here. It took a sharp angle at the very end. There was a little, tiny
dissel (sic). And this injury seemed to be something coming more,
again, at about 20 or 30 degrees, because it was a beveled, flat-like
injury, again relatively superficial, but in a bad area because it was
right smack in a moving joint.

And it also wasn't particularly deep, but it was in an area where
there was a little bit more erythema or redness heaped up in the
lateral areas.

And that was the three lacerations.

Q. You may resume the witness stand.

When you indicated in reference to one of the cuts that it seemed like
a paper cut, you were not suggesting that the cut was caused by paper,
correct?

A. No, I am not.

Q. That's just an expression that you use in describing a particularly
sharp cut, right?

A. Correct.

Q. Okay.

MR. PETROCELLI: The next exhibit in order, Erin?

THE CLERK: 2149.

MR. PETROCELLI: 2149.

(The instrument herein referred to as Robert Huzienga's report dated
6/15/96 was marked for identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No.
2149.)

MR. PETROCELLI: Just these two pages we're going to mark. They're from
a report that you gave on June 15, 1994.

THE WITNESS: Okay.

MR. PETROCELLI: I'm really only interested in these two pages.

I showed you these before court.

MR. LEONARD: I didn't know which part you're --

(Counsel reviews exhibit.)

MR. PETROCELLI: These are the other ones I'm going to show him. You
might as well take a look at them. Okay.

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Could you just briefly verify that these two
diagrams of the left and right hands were prepared by you after your
visit on the 15th with Mr. Simpson?

A. Yes, they were.

Q. Okay. And then we'll talk about them.

You have there exhibit --

MR. PETROCELLI: Move this into evidence, Your Honor.

THE COURT: It's three pages? How many pages is it?

MR. PETROCELLI: Two.

MR. LEONARD: I agree to the -- I don't have any objection to the first
two pages. There's more pages attached to the exhibit.

THE COURT: That's what I was concerned about.

MR. PETROCELLI: If it please Your Honor, I'll put the whole report in.
I was only interested in the two pages.

MR. LEONARD: That's all I'm interested in.

THE COURT: Receive the two and we'll have to detach the two.

MR. PETROCELLI: I'll detach the two.

THE COURT: Okay.

(The instrument previously marked as Plaintiffs' Exhibit 2148 was
received in evidence.)

(The instrument previously marked as Plaintiffs' Exhibit 2149 was
received in evidence.)

MR. PETROCELLI: Can you put the first one up, Steve.

(Mr. Foster complies.)

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Can you see that okay?

A. Yeah.

Q. Is that the diagram that you made after Mr. Simpson left your
office on the 15th, after you had made your notes in the office, when
you were typing things up and transposing [sic] them, right?

A. Correct.

Q. And there's the right hand, correct?

A. Yes, it is.

Q. And you see a notation there to a cut on the right hand, right?

A. Yes, there is.

Q. You want to point that out?

A. There is a small, half of a centimeter, four to five millimeter,
fine, linear laceration in the pulp area of that fourth finger.

Q. Okay. And you describe that, again, as a paper cut, but you didn't
mean to imply it was caused by paper, correct?

A. No. Only that it was a very sharp cut with very sharp linear lines.

Q. Okay.

MR. PETROCELLI: Now, could you, Steve, put the next page up of that
exhibit.

(Mr. Foster complies.)

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Now, this is intended, Doctor, to be a diagram
of the left hand, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. But accidentally, you gave us another picture of the right hand?

A. Right.

Q. So, just so the record is clear, this second page does indicate at
the top "L hand" meaning left hand?

A. Correct.

Q. It's supposed to be a sketching of the injuries you saw on the left
hand; is that correct?

A. That's correct.

MR. PETROCELLI: We can take that off.

You have the other ones I gave you?

MR. LEONARD: I gave them back.

MR. PETROCELLI: Okay.

(Mr. Foster hands document to Mr. Petrocelli.)

MR. PETROCELLI: What's the next one?

Going to put these in next. These are the ones on the 17th. All right.

THE WITNESS: That's right.

MR. PETROCELLI: We'll wait until the Judge is ready.

We're going to mark as 2150, the next two pages -- that's the next one
in order, correct, 2150?

THE CLERK: Yes.

(The instrument herein referred to as left and right hand sketches by
Robert Huzienga from report of 6/17/95 was marked for identification
as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 2150.)

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Is Exhibit 2150 a document prepared by you?

A. Yes, it is.

Q. And Exhibit 2150 consists of two pages sketching the left and right
hands, based on your observations on June 17, correct?

A. That is correct.

MR. PETROCELLI: Your Honor, I move 2150 into evidence.

THE COURT: Received.

(The instrument previously marked as Plaintiffs' Exhibit 2150 was
received in evidence.)

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Now, you made some notations in blue ink on the
left-hand sketch, correct?

A. That I did.

Q. And you did that last night?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Just to reorient yourself?

A. No. I just wrote out the things that I had put in chicken scratch a
little more legible.

Q. And this diagram shows -- the three cuts that you have just
described previously on the left hand, right?

A. Yes, it does.

Q. It also shows the seven abrasions, correct?

A. Yes, it does.

Q. Okay. And the right-hand sketch shows the cut that you just talked
to us about on the right hand, right?

A. Right.

Q. Let me put the left hand up, and you can talk to us about the
abrasions.

Without going through a description, can you point out on the sketch
where the three cuts or lacerations are on the left hand that you
previously testified about?

A. It's the fourth index -- ring-finger laceration.

Here is the distal third-finger laceration.

Here is the more proximal third left finger P.I.P. laceration.

Q. Okay. And could you point out each of the seven lacerations and
briefly describe each one.

A. He had a very fine -- this is not a very good demonstration, as
you'll see from the picture -- but a very fine, small, linear abrasion
over the base of his third finger.

He had three dot abrasions, just a tiny, little, flecks over three
areas, and he had two other abrasions in the lateral aspect of his
left hand.

And this circle right here indicates the ulnar styloid which is this
bone right here.

He had approximately a one-centimeter abrasion right here, and a
half-a-centimeter abrasion, a bit proximal for that ulnar styloid.

It was slightly irregular borders and relatively superficial, very
fine wound, with a little tiny bit of scabbing, but the scabbing
covered that area.

And he also had a very small, fine scab, indicating an abrasion in the
medial -- excuse me the lateral portion of his thumb, distal
interphalangeal joint. So something approximately in that location.

Q. Okay. Thank you.

MR. PETROCELLI: I'll put up some photographs.

Let me put up some photographs that we have been talking about. We'll
see if it shows up on the Elmo.

If not ... hmmmm.

Start with this one.

(Mr. Foster complies.)

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) You recognize the photo?

A. Yes.

Q. We previously marked these as 714 and 715. These are photos
depicting some of the cuts you've told us about.

(The instrument herein referred to as photo of cuts to O.J. Simpson's
hand was marked for identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 714.)

(The instrument herein referred to as photo of cuts to O.J. Simpson's
hand was marked for identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 715.)

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Why don't you describe in sort of simple terms
what that is.

A. This is the cut on his left fourth ring finger. That, as you can
see, extends from his distal finger joint in a very fine, ratty,
irregular fashion.

You can see the sawtooth pattern here, and you can see how it was a
blow, almost, coming at degrees to the finger here.

And you can see this U-shape that I discussed. And it continues on
here, although this is difficult to see in the picture, in a very fine
area.

Then we get to this little area that I said wasn't exactly a
laceration, but in fact, a little chunk of skin had been avulsed off.

Q. Is that another shot of the same thing?

(Photo displayed with finger and ruler.)

A. That is essentially the same photo. You can see the continuity
here. Q. You want to give us a wider shot first Steve, so we can get
the context and then you can zoom it in.

(Photo displayed of hands with knuckles of two fingers facing camera
with a ruler.)

Q. These -- why don't you describe those?

A. These are the cuts on the left third finger. First is the cut in
the lateral aspect, the side aspect of his third finger.

Q. Speak up a little bit, please.

A. Okay.

Q. This is the laceration, the cut we described of -- described in the
third finger, in the lateral, the outside side of the finger that
seemed to come at this angle that we discussed.

And you can see the flap. The cut comes up and around and you can see
the initial part of the healing phase has thickened this little area
of skin and made it come up a little bit.

And then here's the third cut that we've discussed again, over --
almost directly over his left third proximal interphalangeal joint and
coming down in a relatively linear fashion, then taking almost a sharp
60 degree turn here and then a little tiny dissel at the end coming
off.

And this also you can see from the tissue here, if this had been a
straight-on cut, you wouldn't have this amount of tissue swelling
here. And you can see that that also is a beveled, angulated
laceration.

This is a photograph on the 17th, of the lateral aspect of his left
hand.

And here you can see the light off his ulnar styloid this protubrant
bone right here. You can see proximal or closer to the body, upstream.
You can see the smaller irregular shaped, tiny little scab that we
talked about and down stream or distal. You can see the slightly
larger scab that we discussed in that location.

(Indicating to photo of a hand with a prominent knuckle and a ruler.)

A. And there you can see what I talked about as a dot abrasion. Just a
tiny little dot type of scab.

Q. So by the time you observed some of these abrasions, they had begun
to scab over?

A. That is correct.

Q. You want to put the next one up, Steve?

(Mr. Foster displays photo of hand with knuckle facing down.)

THE WITNESS: This is this very fine linear abrasion we discussed.

This is the left hand (indicating to his own hand), coming in this
direction, the same place as my pointer. And here is what they -- the
little tiny dots. Look like -- I believe that's the third dot. I'd
have to study that picture but . . .

(Indicating to displayed close-up of hand with ruler.)

A. This is another picture that includes the very petite linear
abrasion and one of the dot hemorrhages, and I believe this is another
one of the dot hemorrhages that we were discussing.

MR. LEONARD: Can we pull that out a little so we can see?

THE WITNESS: You can see that that linear abrasion measured
approximately one-half of an inch.

MR. LEONARD: Thank you.

THE WITNESS: And again 1, 2, 3 is what we were discussing about those
tiny little dots with a tiny little piece of scab.

MR. PETROCELLI: One more.

(Photo displayed dorsal side of hand with thumb and finger visible.)

THE WITNESS: Again, I can see the half of the small linear abrasion
there and one of the dot hemorrhages. I'm not sure I can see anything

MR. LEONARD: Your Honor, I'd ask to approach.

MR. PETROCELLI: Excuse me. That was a mistake on my part. Page 19,
line 1.

We'll start at line 4. (Reading:)

"... (sic) Detective Bongiorno and you went to the O'Hare Plaza at
around noon?

"A. Yes.

"Q. And that was in response to a call from the LAPD?

"A. Yes. It was a response to a request for assistance in their double
homicide investigation."

MR. PETROCELLI: Page 21. Line 6. And we'll skip the objections, Your
Honor, as to form. We've agreed they're deemed overruled okay as to
form only.

And when --

MR. LEONARD: Your Honor, may I approach on this?

THE COURT: I guess not.

MR. PETROCELLI: We'll just ask the --

THE COURT: No. You can approach, but I guess they weren't deemed . . .
whatever.

(The following proceedings were held at the bench:)

MR. LEONARD: Thought you weren't -- I thought we had an agreement, he
wasn't going to go into hearsay --

MR. PETROCELLI: I'm not --

MR. LEONARD: -- That elicit hearsay.

MR. PETROCELLI: Where?

MR. LEONARD: Which one you going to do?

MR. PETROCELLI: Page 19, line 1 to page 19, line 10.

MR. LEONARD: No, you skipped that, didn't you? That is hearsay. We
spoke to general manager blah, blah, blah, blah.

MR. PETROCELLI: Did I just do it?

MR. LEONARD: No, you didn't. You skipped it.

MR. PETROCELLI: No. I read that one. That one wasn't the problem. I
just read that one. The next one I indicated was page 21, line 6.

MR. LEONARD: It was your understanding that's from hearsay. That part.

MR. PETROCELLI: That's his statement. Why don't you read the answer,
Your Honor, starting on page 18.

THE COURT: Starting at page 18?

MR. PETROCELLI: I want to read from page 21, line 6 through page 23,
line 4.

MR. PETROCELLI: Just background.

MR. LEONARD: I don't care. It's hearsay. If you want that in here, I
want my hearsay.

MR. PETROCELLI: I don't think it's hearsay.

MR. LEONARD: That's -- he's responding to a call.

THE COURT: He's testifying about that he heard from Phillips that the
room --

MR. PETROCELLI: One at time. I can't hear the Judge. I can't hear what
the Judge is saying.

THE COURT: He's testifying that Phillips said he contacted somebody
who said that the room wasn't made up. That's pretty clear hearsay.

MR. PETROCELLI: Okay.

THE COURT: Double hearsay.

MR. PETROCELLI: Okay. Your Honor, take a look at -- I want to cut
through this now. Page --

THE COURT: It's hearsay of Phillips and hearsay of somebody who talked
to them.

MR. PETROCELLI: What about 22, line 11, Your Honor?

MR. PETROCELLI: That question and answer. I'm trying to get him into
the room.

MR. LEONARD: Well, get him into the room.

THE COURT: I -- you can get him in the room.

MR. PETROCELLI: I can't. This is how he described it. I can't make it
up.

MR. LEONARD: I'll stipulate he went in -- he went in the room, made
observations.

THE COURT: I think Mr. Leonard's objecting to the fact that the answer
includes the statement that the room was made up.

MR. LEONARD: Right. They're just going right to that question.

MR. PETROCELLI: Which question?

MR. LEONARD: Line 20. Fine. I don't care about that.

MR. PETROCELLI: Do you have a problem with 23, line 9?

MR. LEONARD: No.

MR. PETROCELLI: Okay. Then I'll read that, then I'm going to go to 26,
line 18.

MR. LEONARD: Not really. I don't know what the relevance is.

MR. PETROCELLI: It's just establishing foundation.

MR. LEONARD: Okay.

MR. PETROCELLI: Then we're going to go to page . That starts his
observations.

MR. LEONARD: Just -- I thought we had an agreement for hearsay. That's
my only problem.

MR. PETROCELLI: I'm trying to keep it out.

MR. LEONARD: Do a better job, will you?

(Continued reading as follows:)

"A. On both sides of the wash basin. The exact spots, I can't recall
right now. But I remember they were on -- I point them out because you
certainly can't see them in this photograph, but they were on each
side of the wash basin. I remember they were -- there were some down
as far as -- down this far on the vanity (indicating)."

MR. PETROCELLI: Line 24. And line 22.

(Reading:)

"Q. And where are you pointing on the other end of the vanity, just so
the record is clear?

"A. Would be to -- would be the left, would be approximately in the
vicinity of the coffee maker."

(Continued reading as follows:)

"Q. How many chips of glass did you find on the vanity?

"A. Total number, I can't recall. There were several. The exact
number, I really don't remember.

"Q. In the locations that you just described?"

(Continued reading as follows:)

"A. On each side of the wash basin along the vanity."

(Continued reading as follows:)

"Q. Let me show you the next exhibit, which is Berris Exhibit 23, and
can you please identify this exhibit?"

MR. PETROCELLI: Over to page 66.

(Reading:)

"Q. What does Exhibit 23 depict?

"A. That is a photograph of the wash basin, of the sink close-up,
showing the broken drinking glass, white cover; and off in the upper
right-hand corner, you can see a -- partially see the face towel that
was on top of the vanity to the right of the wash basin.

"Q. Does that photograph depict the condition of the basin when you
observed it?

"A. Yes.

"Q. So the broken glass that is depicted in the photograph was in the
same condition when you observed it?

"A. Yes."

(Continued reading as follows:)

"Q. Let me show you Berris Exhibit . Can you identify that Exhibit?"

(Continued reading as follows:)

"A. This --

"Q. What is it?

"A. This is a photograph of a wash cloth that was found underneath the
hand towel. Did I call it a face towel before? But the towel that was
to the right of the wash basin. This wash cloth was found underneath
that towel after the photographs had been taken by the Crime Lab
Technicians Stella and Naujokas processing the scene.

"It originally couldn't be seen because the towel had been on top of
it. And this being underneath it, we didn't move anything until after
it was photographed to show things in their original condition. After
the photographs were taken with the towel, the towel was picked up by
the technicians and they discovered this face -- this wash cloth with
a red stain on it, which I suspected to be blood.

"Also you can see one of the glass chips here."

MR. PETROCELLI: Okay. Page 68.

Can you read the answer on page 68, line .

MR. CALLAN: 68 line 6.

(Reading:)

"A. Here's one of the chips here.

That chip would have been hidden from view by the towel. That's why
you couldn't see it before.

"At any rate, this red stain here that you can see on the washcloth
was suspect blood.

"Q. You observed that washcloth with the red stain on it and the chip,
once the towel was removed?

"A. Yes, after it was removed.

"Q. And that's when that photograph was taken?

"A. That's when this photograph was taken. The others were taken
before. Now we discovered something new, so we took a photograph of
this so that it would be a matter of record.

MR. PETROCELLI: Go to page 69, Steve.

(Reading:)

"Q. Please identify Berris Exhibit number 25.

MR. CALLAN: Geez, I'm sorry. Excuse me, Mr. Leonard.

MR. LEONARD: On the okay

I think that was inadvertent.

MR. PETROCELLI: Yeah, that was.

MR. LEONARD: But your apology is accepted.

MR. CALLAN: Thank you.

MR. PETROCELLI: He was apologizing to me.

Can you read the answer on line 13?

(Reading:)

"A. This is another copy of the photograph of the washcloth which was
shown in Exhibit 24, showing the red stain which I suspected to be
blood at the time.

"And also the glass chip, with a bit of difficulty, can be seen here
in the photograph."

(Continued reading as follows:)

"Q. The next Exhibit is Berris Exhibit 26. What is it?"

(Continued reading as follows:)

"A. That's a photograph of the wastebasket in the same bathroom, with
pieces of torn-up green paper in the wastebasket. On the floor next to
the wastebasket are some other papers that were found there.

"Q. And those green pieces of paper that are in the wastepaper basket
were in that condition in that location when you observed that?

"A. Yes.

"Q. Did you at any point in time take those pieces of paper out?

"A. Yes.

"Q. Were you able to observe what was written on them, if anything?

"A. There was a -- the words -- as best I could piece them together,
the words 'Joe,' and I thought, 'Cocowitz' with a telephone number and
the word 'work' on it. But that was the best as I could piece it
together at the time.

"Q. And the pieces of paper on the floor next to the waste-paper
basket, did you pick them up?

"A. Yes.

"Q. And did you observe what they were?

"A. One was a -- The card key of the -- a card key holder with the
signature on it resembling that of Mr. Simpson's registration card,
O.J. Simpson, and the number, room 915.

"Another one had to do with an advertisement for, I think, a
restaurant in the hotel. Something to do with pizza or something like
that."

MR. PETROCELLI: And line 19:

(Reading:)

"Q. Were their" [sic] "any closets in this mini suite?

"A. Closets, not closed, opened-type closets that you could -- I think
there were two areas that might be considered open closet areas where
you could hang clothes but they weren't with a door to be locked.

"Q. Did you look into those closets?

"A. Oh, yes.

"Q. What did you observe?

"A. I observed that there were no laundry bags.

"Q. What else did you observe? Were there any hangers in the closet?

"A. Yes.

"Q. Were there any hangers on the floor?

"A. No."

"Q. Were there any hangers found elsewhere in the mini suite other
than in the closet?

"A. No.

"Q. Were the hangers in the closet hanging on the bar?

"A. Yes.

"Q. By looking in the closet, could you form an opinion as to whether
or not they had been used?

MR. LEONARD: May we approach?

MR. PETROCELLI: I'll withdraw the question.

Skipping over to page 74, line 19. Did you find any laundry bags
anywhere in room 915?

(Continued reading as follows:)

"A. No, none were found.

MR. PETROCELLI: Page 78. (Reading.)

"Did you find any" -- excuse me. Line 17.

"Did you find any broken pieces or shards of glass or chips of glass
on the floor in the bathroom?

"A. No.

"Q. And you found no broken glass anywhere else in this suite of
rooms, right?" Page 79. "Is that correct?

"A. Nowhere else in the entire mini suite, other than on the vanity
and in the wash basin.

"Q. Did you find anything else in the mini suite of rooms that was
broken?

"A. No.

"Q. Do you know what I mean by broken?

"A. Yes.

"Q. Like something else that had been ripped apart or torn apart or
broken?

"A. Nothing at all.

"Q. Okay."

MR. PETROCELLI: Page 104. Depo Exhibit 22, Steve.

(Mr. Foster displays Depo Exhibit 22.)

"Q. Could you look at the photograph of the basin?

Let's pick one. Let's look at -- Exhibit 22 is from a stain on the
basin?

"A. Yes, on the top.

"Q. Yes?

"A. Yes, there is.

"Q. And did you form an opinion as to what that was?

"A. There's a stain right here at the top of the basin. On the side,
right-hand side, that appeared to be a stain that would have been made
by possibly someone at some time, having laid a lit cigarette there
and the nicotine staining the porcelain on the sink top.

"Q. Did you form an opinion as to whether or not that stain was
consistent with blood?

"A. It was examined. It didn't appear to be.

"Q. It did not appear to be what?

"A. Blood.

"Q. Was there any furniture overturned over?

"A. No.

"Q. Was the furniture found in a neat and orderly condition?

"A. Yes.

"Q. The blood stains you saw on the sheets, were they located toward
the middle, center of the bed?

"A. Yes. They appear to be more centered than at the foot" --

MR. PETROCELLI: I'm sorry. Let me read that answer again. (Reading:)

"A. Yes. They appeared to be more centered than at the head or foot."

MR. PETROCELLI: Page 107 line 11. (Reading:)

"Q. Did you find any blood stains, blood-stained tissues inside the
room?

"A. None.

"Q. Did you find any blood-stained toilet paper at all?

"A. None.

"Q. Did you find any blood drops on the bathroom floor?

"A. None.

"Q. Did you find any drops of blood around the wash basin or the
vanity?

"A. None.

"Q. Did you find any drops of blood on the carpet?

"A. None.

"Q. Or next to the bed?

"A. None.

"Q. Or on the telephone?

"A. None.

"Q. Or on the counter where the telephone sits on the bed side table I
should say?

"A. None."

MR. PETROCELLI: That's it, Your Honor.

(Mr. Leonard is reading the questions and Mr. Callan is reading the
answers of the witness.)

CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. LEONARD:

MR. LEONARD: Detective Berris.

MR. CALLAN: Good morning, Mr. Leonard.

MR. LEONARD: A little thinner on the top than last we met.

Okay. If we turn to 110, line 14. (Reading:)

"Q. Let me ask you first of all when you -- did you receive the
initial call from LAPD to assist in the investigation of Nicole Brown
Simpson and Goldman murders?

"A. I personally did not.

"Q. At some point, shortly after the call was received, you were
assigned to take the lead from the Chicago end; is that fair to say?

"A. Yes, I was assigned with Detective Anthony Bojoirno for us
together to go to O'Hare Plaza hotel.

"Q. And you were attempting to do as thorough a job as you could in
the task that you undertook in the investigation, correct?

"A. Yes.

"Q. And to some extent you were directed by the LAPD, is that fair to
say?"

MR. LEONARD: Down to "question is read again." It's repeated. Over to
112, line 15. You with me?

(Continued reading as follows:)

"Q. Were you, to some extent, directed in what you were supposed to do
by the LAPD?

"A. We were requested to go to that location and to investigate Mr.
Simpson's presence there with respect to their investigation. To
collect any possible evidence and interview people who might have
spoken with -- concerning his presence there.

"Q. And do you feel that you and your colleagues did a thorough and
accurate, and a good job in doing that?

"A. Yes, sir.

"Q. You mentioned earlier that you -- you mentioned earlier that the
room was processed?

"A. Yes, it was.

"Q. 915, this suite, I should say?

"A. Yes, it was.

"Q. You have described in Mr. Petrocelli's direct examination of you,
everything that was done in what you called the processing of the
room.

"A. As best I can recollect with what was said, with what I said over
that period of time in his questioning, yes, I think that covers
everything.

"Q. You were there initially for about 20 minutes, correct?

"A. Initially to visually observe the interior of that room or the
rooms.

"Q. And thereafter, you went someplace else and you came back with
some criminalist, correct?

"A. Yes.

"Q. Again, in your direct examination, have you described everything
that the criminalist did at the scene?

"A. As best I can recollect, I think I covered everything.

"Q. Well, you just testified, what, for about two hours just before I
started questioning, right?

"A. Right. Yes.

"Q. And you have a pretty good memory of what you testified to?

"A. Yes. Generally I think we covered just about everything I can
think of.

"Q. All righty.

MR. LEONARD: Okay. Over to 11, line 1.

(Continued reading as follows:)

"... By the way, I notice you're lifting your glasses. Do you have any
trouble with your eyesight of any kind?

"A. I wear glasses. These are bifocals. Sometimes I just want to make
sure I'm looking at the picture correctly.

"Q. Just so in all fairness to everyone involved, you've been asked to
look at a lot of photographs throughout the deposition?

"A. Yes.

"Q. Have you had any difficulty seeing any of these photographs?

"A. No, I don't, none at all.

"Q. And just explain, why did you lift up the glasses like that?

"A. Sometimes I do that and sometime I don't. You know, I just -- I
could look at it this way out of the bifocals."

MR. LEONARD: Okay. Skipping over to 122, line and I've asked for some
answer assistance from Mr. Baker at this point. You ready? (Reading:)

"Q. The photograph which has been marked as Exhibit 16, that
represents a, more or less, full shot photographic shot of the bed
from the bottom end of the bed. Is that fair to say?

"A. Yes.

"Q. And you've testified earlier that that was the condition that the
bed was in when you first entered the room, correct?

"A. Yes.

"Q. And is it fair to say that the best you're able to tell us today
with regard to these red spots that you noticed, was that they were
somewhere in the middle and they weren't close to the head board. Is
that fair to say?

"A. Yes.

"Q. That is fair to say, correct?

"A. Yes.

"Q. Now, let me make sure the question is clear, I'm directing your --
I'm asking you to focus on the location on the bed, not at this point
on which sheet or on which pillow case or anything like that, but the
location of the spots on the bed. Are you following me?"

"A. Yes.

"Q. You're best recollection today is that these spots were somewhere
in the middle of the bed. Not down at one end and not close to the
head board; is that correct?

"A. Yes, for the most part they're toward the center of the bed and
not at the boot or the head. Although there were some spots on that
pillow case or cases -- excuse me. But for the most part, they were
centered toward the center of the bed more than at the end.

"Q. I think you testified earlier that there were spots on the bottom
sheet and the top sheet?

"A. Yes.

"Q. Okay. Did you make any effort to specifically identify where those
spots were or did you ask anyone else to do that by using any kind of
diagram or anything like that?

"A. No. That was not done.

"Q. For instance, you were shown an Exhibit earlier that you called a
blot or plaque?

"A. Yes.

"Q. I would call it a diagram --

"A. Diagram.

"Q. -- Of the suite, correct?

"A. Yes.

"Q. You did not create any such diagram of the bed to show where the
various spots were; is that correct?

"A. No. That was not done.

"Q. You didn't ask anyone to do that?

"A. No.

"Q. Did you make any other, other than to have the spots photographed
and other than your visual observations of the spots, do you follow me
so far? Did you make any other effort of any kind to try to document
where the spots were?

"A. No. Just the descriptions as they were made in the reports.

"Q. That's it?

"A. That's it.

"Q. And now those sheets were ultimately transferred to the LAPD?

"A. Yes.

"Q. What about the pillow cases?"

MR. LEONARD: Down to 20 on page --

(Continued reading as follows:)

"A. All bedding, the bedding which would include the top and bottom
sheets and the pillow cases were ultimately transported to Los Angeles
by the Los Angeles Police Department.

"Q. Okay."

MR. LEONARD: Over to 128, line 18. (Reading:).

"Now, directing your attention to the portion of the bottom of the
glass that's in the basin. Do you see that?"

Could we have 22 up, please?

Mr. Foster, can you do that for me?

MR. FOSTER: Yes.

MR. LEONARD: Hold on.

Line 22, page 128. Okay. Let me read the question again. (Reading:)

"Now directing your attentioon to the portion of the bottom of glass
that's in the basin, do you see that?

"A. Yes.

"Q. Do you recall, when you saw that portion of the bottom of the
glass, that there was a milky colored liquid in it? Do you recall
that?

"A. There was a small amount of what I described in the criminal trial
as a clouded liquid or, by your description, milky colored liquid.
That would be a fair description. Very small amount, though.

"Q. What, if any, observations did you make with regard to the bottom
of that glass when you saw it in the basin?

"A. It was broken.

"Q. Anything else with reference to whether it -- whether or not it
had any type of liquid in it? Did you make any observations?

"A. It had this clouded liquid, a very small amount of that in there,
just very small.

"Q. And what was the -- what was -- and what color was the liquid?

"A. Clouded, whitish liquid, not clear.

"Q. Would it, would you agree that that would -- that that liquid
would be consistent with the residue of water and tooth paste? Would
you agree with that?

"A. It could have been. It could have been.

"Q. Do you know if that liquid was ever analyzed?

"A. It was not analyzed."

MR. LEONARD: Over to 131, page 14. (Reading:)

"Are you aware of any attempts by your police department to do any
kind of analysis of the sink traps or the toilet or anything like that
to determine whether there was the presence of blood in that room?"

"A. That was not done.

"Q. Was there any, your familiar with luminol. Do you know what
luminol is?

"A. No I don't think so.

"Q. You do not?

"A. Can't recall.

"Q. Okay. Would it refresh your recollection if I suggested to you
that luminol is a chemical that can be spread to detect the presence
of blood that is not detectable to the human eye? Have you ever heard
of that before?

"A. No, I can't say that I have."

THE COURT: It probably be easier on our reporter if you --

MR. LEONARD: Slow down.

THE COURT: -- Slow down just a touch.

MR. LEONARD: Let me read that last one. (Reading:)

"Would it refresh your recollection if I suggested to you that luminol
is a chemical that can be spread to detect the presence of blood
that's not detectable by the human eye? "Have you ever heard of that
before?

"A. No, I can't say that I had.

"Q. Are you aware of any techniques that are available to detect the
presence of human blood such as that, in other words, chemical or
otherwise, that is not discernible by the human eye?

"A. Not offhand, no.

"Q. And to your knowledge, no such analysis was undertaken of any
portion of room 915; is that correct?

"A. Not such as that, no.

"Q. And in fact, the only analysis or examination for blood that was
done was simple observation, correct? Isn't that right?

"A. Observation to detect such -- any kind of suspect blood which
would be subsequently transported to the crime lab for analysis as
such.

"Q. So the answer is the only technique that was used was?

"A. Visual.

"Q. Visual observation?

"A. Yes.

MR. LEONARD: I don't have any further questions.

MR. PETROCELLI: Your Honor, a few more questions. (Reading:)

"Q. Detective Berris, do you recall there -- you recall a witness in
the criminal trial by the defense" --

MR. CALLAN: What page are you on?

MR. PETROCELLI: Page 133, line 17. (Reading:)

"Q. You were called as a witness in the criminal trial by the defense?

"A. Yes.

"Q. By O.J. Simpson's lawyers?

"A. Yes.

"Q. And analysis an testing of items of evidence, was that beyond your
scope of responsibility?

"A. Yes, it is."

MR. PETROCELLI: Thank you.

MR. LEONARD: Nothing else.

THE COURT: Okay.

MR. PETROCELLI: Your Honor, at this point in time I'd like to move
into evidence the various photographs which I will now read off for

will be excused.

Let me again remind you not to read anything about this case, not
watch anything on television or listen to anything on the radio. Don't
let anybody talk to you or approach you about anything connected with
this case or yourselves as service or as jurors on this case.

form or express any opinions until this case is finally submitted to
you.

MR. PETROCELLI: Can we take a short break?

THE COURT: Jurors are gone. Who's Werner Spitz on this list?

MR. PETROCELLI: Excuse me.

THE COURT: Warner Spitz.

MR. PETROCELLI: Tomorrow morning, first thing. He's a pathologist.

THE COURT: And you got another list for us?

filling out your list now.

THE COURT: Okay. Great.

MR. BAKER: Are they the same?

(Laughter.)

THE COURT: All right. So at 1:30 we'll resume with the motions; is
that right?

MR. PETROCELLI: Sure.

MR. BLASIER: Your Honor, I advised are even that one of the motions as
that we want to exclude autopsy photographs and mannequins.

I asked Mr. Medvene to have those over here this afternoon so we can
handle that this afternoon.

THE COURT: All right. Fine.

MR. PETROCELLI: No problem.

THE COURT: See you at 1:30.

SANTA MONICA, CALIFORNIA THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 7, 1996 2:05 P.M.

DEPARTMENT NO. WEQ HON. HIROSHI FUJISAKI, JUDGE

(REGINA D. CHAVEZ, OFFICIAL REPORTER)

(The following proceedings were held in open court, outside the
presence of the jury.)

THE COURT: This is a 402 motion.

Plaintiff, go ahead.

MR. GELBLUM: Your Honor, thank you.

We'd like to start with the issue of the admissibility of the
testimony of Dr. Park Dietz.

And before I call Dr. Dietz to the stand, we did submit a brief this
morning on this issue of the admissibility, and particularly on the
applicability of the Kelly Frye testimony.

We think that under the People v. Stoll case, which is a California
Supreme Court case, very recent chronologically, the Kelly Frye test
is not even applicable to this testimony because -- for two reasons:

It's not new to psychology, as you will hear from Dr. Dietz;

And secondly, it is not even conceivable for this testimony to be
considered in the words of Stoll, misleading of a scientific
infallibility. It will be clear that it's Dr. Dietz' testimony, his
personal opinion based on his expertise, there's no way the jury can
say, oh, that must be the answer; we'll have to go with that under
Stoll. That means Kelly Frye doesn't apply.

We would like to proceed with the testimony subject to your ruling.

THE COURT: Do you want to make an opening statement, too?

MR. LEONARD: No.

THE COURT: Okay.

MR. GELBLUM: We call Dr. Park Dietz.

THE CLERK: Sir, if you would, step up behind the court reporter.

Please raise your right hand to be sworn.

PARK DIETZ was called as a witness on behalf of the Plaintiffs, was
duly sworn, and testified as follows:

THE CLERK: You do solemnly swear that the testimony you may give in
the cause now pending before this court shall be the truth, the whole
truth and nothing but the truth so help you God?

THE WITNESS: I do.

THE CLERK: Please be seated.

MR. GELBLUM: Afternoon, Doctor.

THE CLERK: Doctor, would you state and spell your name for the record.

THE WITNESS: My first name is Park, P-A-R-K, middle name Elliott,
E-L-L-I-O-T-T, surname Dietz, D-I-E-T-Z.

MR. GELBLUM: Hello again.

DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. GELBLUM:

Q. Dr. Dietz, what is your current occupation?

A. I'm a physician, specializing in psychiatry; and for some years, my
practice has been limited to the subspecialty of forensic psychiatry.

Q. Okay.

Can you briefly tell the Court what your education is, your higher
education?

A. I received my bachelor's degree in psychology and biology from
Cornell University in .

I received my medical degree and M.D. from Johns Hopkins University
School of Medicine in .

In the same year, I received a master's degree in public health, also
from Johns Hopkins.

And upon completing a dissertation some years later, in 1984, I
received a Ph.D. in psychology, also from Johns Hopkins.

Q. And have you had any training in the area of forensic psychiatry,
Doctor?

A. Yes, I did.

Originally, as part of my residency training in psychiatry, I spent
two years as an assistant resident in psychiatry at Johns Hopkins
Hospital in Baltimore, and then spent my third year of residency as
the chief fellow in forensic psychiatry and resident in psychiatry at
the hospital of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.

MR. LEONARD: Your Honor, stipulate as to his qualifications as a
forensic psychiatrist.

MR. GELBLUM: I'd like to go through a little bit more, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Go ahead.

Q. (BY MR. GELBLUM) Dr. Dietz, can you tell us some of the positions
you've held that are particularly applicable to the testimony here?

A. I spent four years as assistant professor of psychiatry at the
Harvard Medical School.

And my first assignment was as the director of forensic psychiatry for
the hospital for the criminally insane, where I was responsible for
the pretrial evaluations of the more serious criminal defendants
thought to have mental disorders, for the trial courts of
Massachusetts.

Then I spent my third year at Harvard evaluating John Hinkley on
behalf of the U.S. Attorney's office in connection with charges
arising from the attempted assassination of President Reagan.

Then I spent a year studying mentally disordered offenders.

My next position was at the University of Virginia, where I was
originally an associate professor, and later professor of law and
professor of behavioral medicine in psychiatry.

And I was medical director of the Institute of Law Psychiatry and
Public Policy at the University of Virginia. I taught half-time at a
law school, teaching courses in law and psychiatry, criminal behavior,
crimes of violence, and related fields; and half of my time, I spent
directing the fellowship training program in forensic psychiatry and
bringing the forensic psychiatry clinic to the university.

During those years, I also began an active association -- or actually,
rather, continued an association with the FBI Academy in Quantico,
Virginia. That had begun in the late 1970s and was formalized in 1981.

And I have, for the years since then, been the psychiatrist for the
unit that's gone under a variety of names. Today it's called the
profiling unit. It had been the behavioral sciences unit. It is part
of the National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime.

And in 1988, I moved to southern California.

Today, I am clinical professor of psychiatry and biobehavioral
sciences at U.C.L.A. And I divide my time between a forensic
psychiatry practice which occupies half my time, which is actually a
group of -- a number of consultants and another activity, which is
called threat assessment group. And that's a firm which provides
consultation to employers for the prevention of workplace violence.

We also do some work for governmental agencies. It's preventative work
for preventing people from getting hurt.

Q. Did you bring a copy of your curriculum vitae with you?

A. Yes.

MR. GELBLUM: Your Honor, I submit that to the Court for his review and
shortcut the recitation.

THE COURT: I thought he gave it.

MR. GELBLUM: It's just the first couple pages.

MR. LEONARD: No. A lot more.

MR. GELBLUM: Would you like to mark it as an exhibit?

THE COURT: Whatever way you want to do it.

MR. GELBLUM: Shall we?

THE COURT: It's your witness.

MR. GELBLUM: Next in order?

THE CLERK: No; this is plaintiff. Can we mark it Plaintiffs' Exhibit 1
for this hearing.

(The instrument herein referred to as Curriculum Vitae of Dr. Park
Dietz was marked for identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 1 to
this 402 hearing.)

Q. (BY MR. GELBLUM) Dr. Dietz, let me show you, so we can get this
authenticated, what we can mark as Plaintiffs' Exhibit 1 for this
hearing.

Is that a copy of your curriculum vitae?

A. Yes, it is.

Q. And is this up to date?

A. It's up to date as of the date on it, which is October of 1995. So
actually, it's a year old now.

Q. And does it contain your major publications and research and
editorial boards you've sat on?

A. Yes.

Q. Doctor, do you have experience in the field of a crime-scene
analysis?

A. Yes, I do.

Q. And tell us a little bit about what that field is, crime-scene
analysis.

A. Well, crime-scene analysis, of course, is the effort to learn
information from the study of a crime scene.

And because that's the nature of what the field is; it's an activity
primarily of criminal investigators. It's in the routine order of
business for homicide detectives, and has also been, for many years,
indeed, centuries, some physicians, coroners, who include
nonphysicians, have always been involved in crime-scene analysis; and
forensic pathologists have more systematically developed the medical
aspects of crime-scene investigation over the decades.

Forensic psychiatry is rather a latecomer to the systematic analysis
of crime scenes. But that activity of learning from a crime scene what
it has to tell is not specific to medicine or to law enforcement, but
rather, bridges both, and indeed, other fields. There are other
analysts who go to crime scenes and seek to learn from them.

Q. Okay. And tell us a little bit about your experience in crime-scene
analysis.

A. My experience actually began while I was still a medical student. I
had a laboratory at the medical examiner's office in Baltimore and
began to go out to crime scenes with the investigators for the ME's
office.

I continued to work with medical examiner's office in Philadelphia,
when I moved there.

And so I had already been interested in how much one could learn from
crime scenes and from autopsies, about the manner of an offense and
about the behavior of the offender, even before I was formally in
forensic psychiatry.

Q. Did you have any experience with crime-scene analysis at the FBI
Academy?

A. Yes, beginning in 1979.

Q. How long?

A. I was done with my training.

Q. I'm sorry; how long were you there at the FBI Academy?

A. I've gone intermittently ever since 1979.

Q. And have you had experience with crime-scene analysis with other
law enforcement agencies?

A. Yes. I'm the forensic psychiatrist for the New York State Police,
and I have regular involvement both through the FBI and New York State
Police.

Many other agencies, possibly scores, have, over the years, consulted
me on one case at a time, though I have no ongoing relationship with
them.

Q. In your current work as the president of the Threat Assessment
Group, do you get involved in crime-scene analysis?

A. We get involved in the analysis of many unsolved crimes; they don't
always involve what ought to be regarded as a scene, but where there
is a crime scene to evaluate. We're involved in that.

Q. Are you familiar with the concept of indirect behavioral
assessment?

A. Yes.

Q. What is that concept?

A. That's actually a concept I introduced in the mid-eighties to
encompass a range of activities that people in my field of forensic
psychiatry and related fields were often involved in.

It was meant to encompass the activity of psychological autopsies.
That was -- had been ongoing since the 1960s, in fact, starting in the
LA Coroner's Office, where much of the original work was done on the
concept of psychiatric autopsies. It encompassed the efforts that
physicians were making to evaluate the mental state of testators who
were already dead and no longer available to examine.

It encompassed the work that was then called "profiling" being done by
the FBI, which was the effort to analyze a crime scene or series of
crimes, to be able to narrow the scope of the investigation toward a
smaller group of suspects. The term was also meant to encompass the
analysis of threatening communications or anonymous letters, bomb
threats, death threats, et cetera, where one was trying to infer about
human behavior from evidence of a kind that didn't include a
face-to-face interview with the person whose behavior was being
evaluated.

And there are other examples, as well, of the activities that forensic
psychiatrists and law enforcement officers engage in, where we have to
try to reason from data, other than interview, data about human
behavior.

Q. Is that something that forensic psychiatrists do routinely?

A. It is, as a matter of fact.

Unlike clinical psychiatry and forensic psychiatry, it's been long
recognized that because people who are parties to a matter are not
always truthful, the indirect evidence about behavior is often more
reliable than the direct evidence that might come from an interview.
So whereas in clinical psychiatry, doctors obviously rely greatly on
what their patients tell them. In forensic psychiatry, we have to rely
on more than direct sources of information.

Q. Now, in this case, Dr. Dietz, are you prepared to render an opinion
regarding a likely motive that Mr. Simpson had for committing the two
murders at issue here?

A. Yes.

Q. And is that opinion based on any technique, process or theory that
is new to science?

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Leading.

THE COURT: This being a 402 hearing, overruled.

THE WITNESS: Well, as a predicate to my -- and I want it to be clear
that your answer assumes that Mr. Simpson is indeed the killer.

And given that assumption, I'm prepared to offer an opinion as to
motivation.

And that opinion would be based on a kind of analysis that is not new
and that is not one that I would characterize as a scientific
technique.

Q. Can you describe the process for us?

A. Yes.

The process is a rather straightforward one of first looking at the
crime scene through photographs and diagrams, looking at the injuries
to the victims as portrayed in autopsy photographs, and then the
protocol from each autopsy.

And based on the information that comes from the scene and from the
autopsies, looking at the behavior that was necessary in order for
that scene to have resulted and for those injuries to have resulted,
and then reasoning about that scene and those injuries to examine what
inferences, if any, can be drawn behaviorally about the offender.

Q. Does that person you're talking about now assume that Mr. Simpson
is the perpetrator, or is that simply trying to figure out whoever did
it, what's the motivation for this particular crime?

MR. LEONARD: Vague. I didn't understand it.

THE COURT: Overruled.

MR. LEONARD: It's up to you if you understand it.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: What I said in my last answer is not based on any
assumption of who did it; but rather, my first approach to look at
motive is to look at the crime scene and the autopsy information.

Q. And that's regardless of who you think may or may not have done it,
has nothing to do with Mr. Simpson?

A. That's correct. That is one source of information as to motive. If
one of them then changes ground and says, assuming that Mr. Simpson is
the killer, what is the motive, that brings into play other data that
are specific to Mr. Simpson and to Ms. Simpson and to Mr. Goldman and
to the relationships.

And so with that other information, then it becomes possible to, of
course, be much more specific.

Q. Okay. Let's start just with the first one you described, which is
the analysis.

As I understand what you're saying, it's based solely on the
photographs that you've seen of the crime scene and the autopsies and
the autopsy protocols; is that right?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay. Now, when you're analyzing those, are you applying what you
would call any kind of scientific technique or method?

A. No.

Q. Are the materials that you just described that you relied on in
forming your opinion, materials that are typically relied upon by
other experts in this field?

A. Yes. And in any homicide case, a forensic psychiatrist ought to be
concerned with the crime scene and with the autopsies or autopsy of
the victim. And that kind of information is routinely relied on by
those who pay attention to the data as they should.

Q. What kind of people, in your experience, engage in that kind of
analysis; what kinds of occupations?

A. Well, for crime-scene analysis and looking at all autopsies to
learn about the behavior, that's possibly done most often by homicide
detectives who, at every homicide scene, are trying to do precisely
that, and who attend autopsies largely for that purpose.

It's also done by medical examiners and the other investigators who
work at medical examiners' offices, other people in the forensic
sciences, including, of course, forensic psychiatry.

Q. Is there published literature in this field?

A. Yes, there is.

Q. Can you cite any examples of it?

A. Certainly.

All textbooks of homicide investigation talk about crime-scene
analysis. And that's been true for more than a century.

Probably the earliest psychiatric writings just talk specifically
about crime scenes, which would be the writings of Richard von
Krafft-Ebing, who, unlike other forensic psychiatrists of his day, a
century ago, had developed a close friendship with the preeminent
professor of criminology at the time, Hans Gross, who was a student of
crime scenes and wrote the most important textbook of criminal
investigation.

In fact, it's still in print today.

Q. When was that first published?

A. Sometime prior to 1875.

Q. Okay. And that's essentially the same kind of crime-scene analysis
that we're talking about in this case?

A. Well, it starts from the same place. Now, over the years, we have
learned something -- or at least we all like to think so -- that the
techniques have been that -- that existed then have become enhanced
somewhat by further information that's developed over the years, and
it continues to evolve.

The first writing specifically about making behavioral inferences from
crime scenes might be a book by James Brussel, published in 1968,
called Case_Book_of_a_Crime_Psychiatrist.

And Dr. Brussel had been involved in solving the case known as "The
Mad Bomber," involving George Matesti and that by looking at indirect
evidence that helped him point toward a particular suspect.

Q. Can you cite any additional publications in the area of forensic
psychiatry relating to crime-scene analysis?

A. Yes. Well --

Q. Do you have a list of them?

A. In my head, not in my hand.

Q. Just give us, perhaps, the leading few.

A. Probably the best known work today would be the
FBI_Crime_Classification_Manual, which is not a

forensic psychiatry work, but a law enforcement work.

Q. Okay. Any others of particular note?

A. I wouldn't want to characterize them as leading, but I should
mention two of my own.

Q. Okay.

(Laughter.)

THE WITNESS: I published an article called Sex
Offender_Profiling_by_the_FBI.

Q. Where did you publish that?

A. It was originally in a Justice Department publication called
Proceedings_of_a_Forensic_Science_
Symposium_on_the_Analysis_of_Sexual_Assault_Evidence. And it was
reprinted in Clinical_Chronicles, which was published by the
University of Toronto.

Q. And what was the other article you were going to mention?

A. Another one of mine that I think is on point is entitled
Sexual_Fatalities_Behavioral_ Reconstruction_and_Equivocal_Cases.

Q. Where was that published?

A. Originally, in the Journal_of_Forensic_ Sciences.

Q. Doctor, have you ever qualified to testify as an expert in court on
a similar opinion; that is, testifying as to motive, based on an
analysis of the crime scene and autopsy?

A. Yes.

Q. Can you cite to us some cases?

A. Of course. That comes up as part of nearly every homicide case that
I testify in.

So, backwards, from most recent homicide cases where we've talked
about the crime scene and motive, would include
California_versus_Ernesto_ Anguiano, where I testified in October of
'96.

One was Wisconsin versus -- sorry; that one's not a homicide.

California_versus_Sally_McNeil, where I testified at trial in March of
'96.

California_versus_Erik_Menendez, where I testified in February of '96.

California_versus_Richard_Davis, which is the Polly Klaas case. I
testified at trial in May of '96.

Q. Did you justify arriving -- determining -- trying to determine
motive from an analysis of the crime scene in the Klaas case?

A. Yes. In fact, that was the principal purpose of my participation in
the case.

United_States_versus_James_E._Swann,_Jr., where I testified at trial
in September '94.

Q. Please tell us how many others there are in the last, say, five
years.

A. Nine others from that point back to the mid-90s.

Q. And each of those you were testifying -- part of your testimony had
to do with deriving motive from analysis of the crime scene and/or
autopsy photos?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, the other opinion you mentioned, opinion you said, assuming
Mr. Simpson is the perpetrator, trying to determine a likely motive
that he would have had; is that right?

A. Yes.

Q. And how did you -- what method did you use, or what did you do to
arrive at that opinion?

A. To the information that I already had from the crime scene and
autopsy information, I then added information specific to Mr. Simpson,
which included portions of his testimony; his prior statements; his
writings; Nicole Simpson's writings, including her diary; statements
that were transcribed -- that is, transcripts of statements made by
witnesses; some transcribed trial testimony; a 911 tape; and a
surreptitiously made recording known as the Lally tape; a transcript
of the conversation during the so-called slow-speed chase between Mr.
Simpson and the law enforcement.

Q. Are those kinds of materials the kinds of materials that are
typically relied upon by forensic psychiatrists in assessing motive?

A. Yes.

Q. Is there a body of scientific literature regarding motives for
homicide?

A. Yes, there is.

Q. Are you familiar with that body of knowledge?

A. Yes, I am.

Q. Is that something you keep abreast of in your work?

A. Yes, reasonably well.

Q. Okay. And have you been qualified as an expert to testify in other
cases about a particular motive, that is likely to be the defendant's
defense in the case, had for committing the crime for which he's on
trial?

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Not relevant as phrased.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: Yes, I have.

Q. (BY MR. GELBLUM) Can you give us a few examples?

A. I think all the cases that I just listed would be examples of that.

Q. You did -- you rendered both kinds of opinions in those cases? In
other words, an opinion that wasn't specific to the person on trial,
as well as an opinion it was specific to the motive of that person?

A. Well, they'd be opinions that were derived from both.

Q. Both from the crime scene and from the other information you just
described?

A. Yes. I think of the cases I specifically mentioned, all have a
known offender.

Now, there are other instances where I testified as to motive, where
the offender was unknown. But I don't think I listed any by name.

Q. Okay. And is the method -- are the methods that you used in
arriving at these two opinions, methods that are generally accepted in
the field of forensic psychiatry?

A. I think "method" may put it too strongly, but this approach is
generally accepted and is routinely done throughout the field.

Q. How do you know that?

A. Because I'm in touch often with colleagues. I'm the immediate past
president of our national academy. And so I do have a good sense, I
think, of what others are doing.

MR. GELBLUM: I have nothing further, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Cross.

CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. LEONARD:

Q. Nice to see you again.

A. Hello.

Q. Let me make sure I understand your testimony completely. You
testified that you that -- your testimony had been admitted in a
number of cases -- and correct me if I'm wrong, involving motive for
an offense, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Your assessment of what the motive was, right?

A. Yes.

Q. And in each and every one of those cases the perpetrator was
already known. In other words, there was an assumption that an
individual had committed the crime, right?

A. In each one that I listed by name, that's correct.

Q. Yeah. You were testifying, for instance, in the -- when there was
an insanity defense or diminished capacity defense raised, correct, in
most of those cases?

A. In most of those, that would be true also.

Q. So, you weren't testifying as to whether or not a particular
defendant was guilty based on your motive analysis, you were just
trying to gauge the motive for purposes of determining whether the
defendant had a diminished capacity. Is that defined under the various
laws and also whether -- whether or not there was a legitimate
insanity defense, correct?

A. In all but one, that's correct. That one of the named -- one of the
cases that I named earlier, the sole exception would be
California_V.__Davis in which my testimony did go specifically to his
guilt to one charged offense that he had denied committing.

Q. And -- but there were a number of uncharged offenses that were
involved in that case, correct or not? Correct me if I'm wrong.

A. Would you repeat the question?

Q. Were there a number of uncharged offenses that were at issue in
that case, in the Klaas case, Polly Klaas case?

A. I don't know what you mean by an uncharged offense being at issue.

Q. In that case, you had actually had some access to medical records
of the defendant, correct?

A. Many kinds of records of the defendant, including medical.

Q. Including medical records, right?

And you had -- you had had actually access to some evaluations that
had been done of the defendant by other psychologists or
psychiatrists, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay. Now, let me see if I can understand how you compartmentalized
your opinions in this case. Let's focus on the crime scene analysis.

What you've done, essentially, and you use the word "profiling"
several times, and I think I know what that means, but as I understand
it, what you do is that you look at crime scene photographs. You look
at the autopsy protocol and then you determine whether or not that
what you see in this information fits the pattern or profile that you
would expect to see in a certain kind of crime; that is, a certain
homicide that was motivated by a certain mental state of the
defendant, correct?

A. Not exactly, no.

Q. But in this case you, in fact, looked at the crime classification
manual, correct?

A. That is one thing I did, yes.

Q. You tried to determine whether the pattern that had been developed
by the behavioral science unit at the FBI was the facts, as you
understood them, fit into the pattern, correct?

A. Having reached an opinion, based on my own analysis, I then turned
to the manual and found that there was a correspondence between my
analysis of this case and their descriptions of a spontaneous domestic
homicide.

Q. And that's the kind of thing, for instance, that the behavioral
science unit did in the Richard Jewell case; is that right?

A. No, I don't think so. I think they were doing something different
there.

Q. They did a profile based on what they knew about the incident, the
bombing incident, correct?

A. I don't know what they originally did, and I'm unfortunately, not
able to discuss my current role in that case.

Q. Okay. You, in your testimony, and during your deposition, you
indicated that you had looked at crime classification manual, right;
and you had also thought about your own experience and your own -- The
information you had about various kinds of homicides and you decided
that this homicide fit a certain pattern, right?

A. "You decided?"

Q. You decided it looked like a spousal homicide to you; is that
right?

A. Based on my review of the autopsy information and the crime scenes,
I reached certain opinions about this crime. I then later turned to
the manual and found a correspondence between my own findings and
their description of spousal homicide, that's correct.

Q. Okay. Of course, it wasn't a perfect fit, was it? In other words,
the factors that were indicated in the crime classification manual,
you didn't find all of those with regard to spousal homicide, did you?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. Irrelevant.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: No. That's why this isn't an undertaking of trying to
look for a one-size-fits-all pattern.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Okay.

A. Instead, it's an analysis of a particular crime.

Q. Tell me, how can the judge, how can a jury, how could I, in
cross-examining you possibly test the accuracy of your opinion? What
could I look to? Tell me.

A. Well, the first thing you could do is test the logic of what I have
to say about the relationship between the scene or the injuries and my
conclusions.

You can probe whether they seem unreasonable. You can confront me with
evidence that seems to contradict what I've said. You can show me how
I've relied on incorrect information.

In other words, you can do the things that cross examiners always do
with expert witnesses; and in addition, you could point out
information that shows that I'm wrong, and that this crime wasn't a
domestic homicide; that it was committed by someone else.

Q. Okay. But there is no -- when you sat down and you decided that you
could render an opinion in this case, you had a pattern in mind,
correct? It was in your mind. It was in the crime classification
manual, right?

A. I think you misapprehend the pattern issue. When I sat down and
looked at this case, I was looking at a crime scene that had a lot of
information in it.

And my original opinions come from looking at that scene and what it
has to say.

Just as I think any experienced investigator would look at that scene
and reach largely, similar opinions. Those opinions don't purport to
prove who did it and it would be an inappropriate use of that kind of
analysis, to say this who did it.

Q. Thank you, Doctor.

Now, you would agree with me that this type of profiling you're
talking about or discerning appearance, that has no place in a court
of law in determining whether or not a defendant is guilty or
innocent, would you agree with that, sir?

A. I don't think that's for me to say. I think that's for the Court to
decide.

Q. Isn't that what you just said?

A. I think I just said that this kind of analysis does not purport to
prove who, in fact, committed this crime.

Q. Okay?

A. I think evidence is admitted throughout criminal trials that does
not in and of itself, taken alone, prove who committed this particular
crime. And the same thing is true in a civil suit such as this in
which no one piece of evidence may prove who committed this particular
crime.

Q. As a matter of fact, if I asked you, to a reasonable degree of
medical certainty, whether you can sit in front of this jury and tell
them that Mr. Simpson committed the crime, your answer is no; isn't
that right?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. Irrelevant.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Isn't that right?

A. My answer is even more helpful to you --

Q. Thank you.

A. I would say I wouldn't answer that question because that's not my
role.

Q. It would be unethical, wouldn't it?

A. I think it's so far beyond the pail that it would be out of the
question.

Q. Now, you also are of the opinion that based on everything you know
about the preoffense behavior of Mr. Simpson, that if you had to bet,
you would bet that he didn't commit the murder. Didn't you say that in
your deposition?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. Irrelevant. This isn't cross-examination on
his deposition. We're here to determine the Kelly Frye issues, not the
test of validity.

THE COURT: I assume you're going to be offering this witness for the
objective of proving your case.

MR. GELBLUM: Of course.

THE COURT: And I think reasonable cross-examination would encompass
this witness's opinion in that regard at that point.

This being a 402 hearing, overruled.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) You remember testifying to that in your
deposition?

A. That's a mischaracterization. I'll tell you what I did testify to
that you're misrepresenting. I testified that if the information
available prior to these homicides concerning an abusive relationship
were addressed for the purpose of prediction that one could safely bet
that Mr. Simpson would continue to abuse Ms. Simpson. But one could
not safely bet that Mr. Simpson would eventually, some day, kill Ms.
Simpson.

Q. And by the way, when you were at your -- Have you done anything
since your deposition? You review any materials, got any additional
information?

MR. GELBLUM: Your Honor this is not a discovery tool here, Your Honor.

MR. LEONARD: It's a foundational question.

THE COURT: Okay. I'll strike it if it isn't.

THE WITNESS: Not about this case.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) What case did you think I was asking about?

MR. GELBLUM: Your Honor, objection. Argumentative.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Isn't it true that at your deposition, that you
had very little knowledge at all about the prior history of Mr.
Simpson and Nicole Brown Simpson; isn't that true?

A. I think that's true.

Q. And you were willing to opine that point, that Mr. Simpson was the
kind of person to commit this crime; isn't that right?

Do you remember saying that?

A. Actually what I repeatedly said was that my testimony about
preoffense behavior would go to the point that there is nothing about
Mr. Simpson's preoffense behavior that would exclude him as the kind
of person who would commit this crime.

Q. Oh, okay.

So what you're saying is that you can't say that he did it, but you
can say that -- you can't say that he didn't do it, right?

Is that what you're saying?

A. What I'm saying is that I would not presume to say that he did it.
I would, however, be prepared to say that as to rebut any suggestion
that he's the kind of person who wouldn't have or couldn't have done
it.

Q. Let me read you from page 77 of your deposition.

MR. PETROCELLI: What line?

MR. LEONARD: Line 11.

MR. PETROCELLI: One second.

(Pause for Plaintiff's Counsel to read.)

MR. PETROCELLI: Okay.

MR. LEONARD: The question is (reading):.

"Okay.

"What I mean when I say that this preoffense behavior is such as to
make him the prime suspect in the eyes of an experienced investigator,
I mean to say that from behavior of him and characteristics of him
there for the offense that are highly suggestive, that's exactly the
kind of person who would do such a thing."

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Do you remember testifying to that in your
deposition, sir?

A. Yes.

Q. That's the basis to what you intend to elicit. That's what you
intend to tell this jury, correct? That's what you'd like the jury to
note at the end of your testimony?

MR. GELBLUM: Irrelevant what this witness wants this jury to know.

THE COURT: You may rephrase it.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Isn't that what you're trying to impart to this
jury, that Mr. Simpson is the kind of person that would commit this
crime?

A. Not me, no.

Q. That's what you said in your deposition, didn't you?

MR. GELBLUM: Your Honor, it's a deposition. It's irrelevant.

Your Honor, may I be heard on this to the extent that this --

THE COURT: This a 402 hearing.

MR. GELBLUM: That's exactly what I was going to say, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Go ahead.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Did you or did you not say that?

A. I said that in my deposition in response to whatever this line of
questioning was.

But I did not say that that's an opinion that I intend to offer at
trial. And I, of course, do not have anything in particular that I
care to tell this jury about. I'm responding to questions as they're
asked.

And my understanding of what you've been asked in this respect about
pretense behavior is to be able to rebut any suggestion that Mr.
Simpson couldn't have done it 'cause he's not the kind of person who
would.

Q. So I just wanted to make that clear for the Court that that's what
your -- that's what your intent here is, right?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. Asked and answered.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Let me ask you something. I found this curious in
your deposition.

When you -- when you're attempting to testify as to the behavioral
reconstruction, if you will, that is not just the -- not just the
information that's contained in the autopsy reports and the
photographs? You're relying on what you called -- what is -- what's
another phrase you used? I haven't heard that before, "indirect
behavioral assessment."

In other words, you're relying on what third parties have said about
Mr. Simpson or what they've said about Nicole Brown Simpson; is that
right? That's part of what you rely on?

A. All sources of information other than what the defendant himself
says are indirect.

Q. Yeah. Yeah. You wouldn't want to rely on the defendant, right?

MR. GELBLUM: Your Honor, he testified. He read the defendant's
deposition.

THE COURT: This is getting a little argumentative. You know there's no
jury here.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) You -- obviously you didn't interview Mr. Simpson,
right?

A. No, I haven't had that opportunity.

Q. Did you ask these attorneys if they could petition the Court for an
independent medical report?

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Did you -- did you -- did you look at any
standardized tests or have any standardized tests administered to Mr.
Simpson?

A. No. That isn't available to me either.

Q. Now, when you get this information that comes from third parties,
you know, statements or things they've said to the police or things
they've said to other third parties, how do you decide what to believe
and what not to believe?

A. Well, I start by believing photographs and what I can see with my
own eyes.

Q. I'll make the question very clear. I'm not talking about
photographs. I'm talking about information that you receive from third
parties' statements and so forth which you're relying on in rendering
your opinion in this case, right?

Tell me what -- how would you assess the veracity of those kind of
statements?

A. The same way anyone else does. That is by judging their internal
plausibility, by judging their consistencies with other information,
by judging whether they fit the other facts as they're known. By
learning whether the individuals have been discredited or have had
their reliability called into account in exactly the same way the
fact-finder does.

Q. Isn't that what the jury's supposed to do in a trial?

A. Absolutely.

Q. That's not your job, is it?

A. Well, it's also necessary in order to draw any opinions to be able
to look at what the facts seem to be and all facts are in play in the
midst of a legal dispute.

My role is different from that of perhaps fact witnesses in that I'm
required to be fair in my analysis of what to rely upon and by my view
that I'm ethically bound to disclose when I'm aware that there is an
unreliable source of information. Whereas fact witnesses don't have to
worry themselves about those things.

Q. How much you normally bill an hour?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. Relevance.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: My customary private fee is $600 an hour. My government
fee is $400 an hour and it's the latter that I'm charging on this
case.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Okay. No further questions.

MR. GELBLUM: Just a couple, Your Honor.


REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. GELBLUM:

Q. Dr. Dietz, you testified in cases other than the Davis case, as to
motive or the issue was whether a person had committed a crime as
opposed to an insanity issue?

A. Yes.

Q. All right. You -- do you know how many other cases -- about how
many other cases?

A. There are three that I can point to specifically. I don't know how
many additional ones there may also be.

Q. Okay. Do you know the names of those three?

A. I know the name of two. Vance_versus_ Krause which was a civil case
in Georgia known as the civil murder trial, in which a man denied
having killed his wife. But I was plaintiffs' expert in a case
designed to prove that he had killed his wife so that he wouldn't
receive the life insurance benefits from his murder.

And a second case that I can recall by the name South Carolina versus
Register. There was no mental defense raised and my recollection is
that it was based on crime scene and other indirect evidence of his
behavior that I testified as to the motive of the offender.

I don't recall too much detail about it. And then the third case that
I can recollect was an Ohio case in which a man was involved in the
asphyxia death of a woman he knew and I don't remember too much about
it.

But it was based on crime scene evidence and other indirect evidence
that I testified.

Q. You ever testified in premise liability cases?

A. Oh, yes. Well, I do that often. In many of those involved exactly
the issue of looking at a crime scene and talking about the behavioral
reconstruction of the offense and the motivation of the offender who
may well be unknown.

Q. And approximately how many times have you done that?

A. I don't have a list of all those along, but I would imagine it's
possibly been, oh, I'd say a dozen or more in the last two or three
years where I've testified at a deposition about those issues and a
few of them have come to trial.

Q. A few of them have come to trial?

A. Yes.

Q. And finally, Doctor, can you describe just briefly and generally
what you testified to in the Richard Davis case on this subject of
motive and identity?

A. In that case, the defendant had denied having committed lewd acts
against Polly Klaas which was one of the charged offenses. And there
were three crime scenes. The Klaas residence, from which she had been
abducted; a location on a hillside, where she was held for a time
while he got his car out of a ditch; and a third location where her
body was recovered.

And each of those crime scenes revealed evidence related to the
motivation of the offender.

For example, at the residence where Polly and her friends were first
approached by the offender, were found precut length of a
lingerie-like fabric that Davis had brought with him and had used to
restrain the three girls. The fact that he used lingerie fabric, that
he had precut it and brought with him a knife to the scene indicated
that he'd fantasized in advance about his crime and had intended to
restrain victims.

At the second -- oh, and he took with him from that scene tights and a
nightgown that he later put on Polly.

At the second scene, at the hillside, there was evidence of a clearing
in the woods. Davis had been seen there by witnesses with brush
residue on, like, leaves and pine, pine needles. There was a condom
wrapper of a brand that's unusual but to which Davis was known to have
access.

And at the third location, where her body was found, although she was
in an advanced state of decomposition, there was additional evidence
suggestive of sexual assault in that her nightgown was inverted in a
manner inconsistent with her having been dragged and thereby having
the nightgown removed because it was symmetrical.

Q. What conclusions did you come to and testify to on the basis of
your analysis of the physical evidence?

A. On the basis of that and more --

Q. Right?

A. -- I was able to conclude that Davis had, in fact, intended to
commit a sex offense against Polly Klaas and had, in fact, engaged in
lewd acts with her.

Q. And you were permitted by the Court to testify to that subject?

MR. LEONARD: Objection.

THE COURT: Overruled.

MR. LEONARD: Lack of foundation.

THE COURT: He testified or he didn't.

Q. (BY MR. GELBLUM) Did you testify to those conclusions in court?

A. I testified about it being a sexually motivated offense and about
his desire to control a helpless, suffering victim.

Q. Thank you, Doctor.

MR. LEONARD: Your Honor, couple more.

THE COURT: Go ahead.

RECROSS-EXAMINATION. BY MR. LEONARD:

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) In the Davis case, it was assumed and known who
the offender was, correct?

A. He had confessed to the murder.

Q. Right.

A. But not the sex.

Q. At issue was whether or not he had committed sexual acts in the
course of the murder, correct?

A. That was the issue for me, yes.

Q. It had nothing to do with whether or not he was the person who
committed the murder. He was -- he already confessed and was
identified, right?

A. Yes.

Q. And was your testimony challenged in that case in any way, if you
know?

A. Yes. There was a hearing prior to the -- to the trial that had to
do with what language I would be permitted to use.

Q. Oh, okay. Thanks. Nothing further.

MR. GELBLUM: Nothing.

THE COURT: You may step down.

(The following proceedings were held in open court outside the
presence of the jury:)

MR. PETROCELLI: With the Court's permission, I'd like to move in
Exhibit 204.

THE CLERK: It's actually 2148, the hand diagram.

MR. PETROCELLI: I'd like to move in Exhibit 21 --

THE CLERK: Next in order is 2160.

MR. PETROCELLI: From Detective Berris' examination.

Thank you.

THE COURT: Received.

(The instrument herein referred to was marked for identification and
received in evidence as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 2160.)

THE COURT: Next.

MR. GELBLUM: Your Honor, plaintiffs' call Dr. Dutton. Dr. Donald
Dutton.

DONALD DUTTON, called as a witness on behalf of Plaintiff Goldman, was
duly sworn and testified as follows:

THE CLERK: You do solemnly swear that the testimony you may give in
the cause now pending before this court shall be the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

THE WITNESS: I do.

THE CLERK: Sir, if you would, please swing that microphone under your
chin.

Thank you.

And would you please state and spell your name for the record.

THE WITNESS: Donald George Dutton. D-O-N-A-L-D, G-E-O-R-G-E,
D-U-T-T-O-N.

DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. GELBLUM:

Q. Afternoon, Dr. Dutton.

A. Afternoon.

Q. What is your occupation, sir?

A. I'm a psychologist.

Q. What kind of psychologist?

A. I'm a research psychologist with a specialty in forensic psychology
and specifically in spousal violence.

Q. And how long have you specialized in spousal violence?

A. Twenty-two years.

Q. Okay. Did you bring your curriculum vitae with you?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Okay.

MR. LEONARD: Stipulate he's an expert in forensic psychology, Your
Honor.

MR. GELBLUM: And family violence, as well.

MR. LEONARD: Whatever.

MR. GELBLUM: Yes.

MR. LEONARD: Sure.

Q. (BY MR. GELBLUM) Is this a copy of your C.V.?

A. Yes.

MR. GELBLUM: I'd Like to mark this Plaintiffs' 2 for this hearing.

THE COURT: Okay.

(The instrument herein referred to as Donald Dutton's curriculum vitae
was marked for identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 2 to this 402
hearing.)

Q. Dr. Dutton, have you ever testified or -- I'm sorry -- qualified in
court before as an expert on family violence issues?

A. Yes, I have.

Q. How many times?

A. Twelve times.

Q. Are those cases listed in your C.V.?

A. Yes, they are.

Q. Okay. The -- you currently conducting any research in the area of
family violence?

A. Yes, I am.

Q. Will you describe that research, please.

A. One's a continuation of a project that develops profiles of abuse
perpetrators, looks at what their psychological profile looks like.

And the other is a study that we're currently doing on men who have
been convicted of spousal homicide. These are men who are federally
incarcerated.

Q. Okay. And what are you studying them for?

A. We are attempting to ascertain if there's any sort of common
pattern in the modus operandi of the killing, if there's any common
factors that would characterize spousal killings, if there's any kind
of psychological profile that relates to either the modus operandi or
other characteristics of the killing.

Q. Are you prepared in this case, Dr. Dutton, to render an opinion
regarding factors that are characteristic of spousal homicide?

A. Yes, I am.

Q. Is there a substantial body of literature in the field of those
types of characteristics?

A. There is a substantial body. There's in the neighborhood of 40
separate research papers, and several books have been written on the
topic.

Q. Can you name some of the books?

A. Yes. As a matter of fact, I've got some of them here.

One of them is called Homicide_In_ Families by Ann Goetting,
G-O-E-T-T-I-N-G.

One of them is called Femicide: Politics_of_Woman_Killing by Joe
Radford and Diana Russell.

One of them is called When_Battered_Women Kill, by Angela Brown.

And there's a compendium of research here called
Lethal_Silence_2000,_The_Source_Book_on_Fatal_

Domestic_Acquaintance_and_Stranger_Aggression, that is an edit book
that has 40 plus chapters on various forms of violence, including
chapters on spousal homicide and spousal violence.

Q. Are there any journals that are devoted to the issue of family
violence?

A. There's at least three. One is called Violence_in_Victims; one is
called Journal Family Violence, and one called the Journal of Western
Violence. They are either exclusively or predominantly concerned with
issues of family violence.

Q. Are articles about family violence, including spousal homicide,
included in other journals?

A. Yes. American_Journal_of_Orthopyschology , criminology journals,
from time to time, will have articles on spousal homicide.
The_New_England_Journal of_Medicine and the
Journal_of_the_Medical_Association have recently published articles on
spousal homicide.

Q. Do many of those articles and journals and books discuss factors
that have been found to -- in research to be present -- to be
characteristics of spousal homicide?

A. Yes, they do.

Q. Are there conferences that are devoted to the issue of family
violence?

A. Yes. There's an international family -- family violence research
conference held annually at the University of New Hampshire that's
been held since . In addition to that, there's -- the International
Family Law Conference frequently has discussion of issues on family
violence.

The American Society of Criminology presents research papers on family
violence and spousal homicide.

And the American Psychological Association also does the same.

And there's a Division 41 of the American Psychological Association,
which is called Psychology and Law, which is a especially interested
in issues of spousal violence.

Q. You said you formed an opinion regarding certain factors that are
characteristic of spousal homicide?

A. Yes.

Q. How did you determine those factors?

How did you go about reaching that opinion?

A. Well, I examined the research literature that -- all of the
empirical studies that had been developed, which really examined the
circumstances surrounding the deaths of women, and in many cases
compared that to nonintimate homicide cases, and tried to ascertain
what factors characterized or stood out when one was examining
intimate homicide or an "intimate femicide," as it's sometimes called.

Q. Say what you mean by "intimate homicide."

A. Intimate homicide means any homicide that occurs in a relationship
where there's been an emotional or sexual intimacy between the
perpetrator and the victim.

And intimate femicide refers to the same thing, but where the victim
of the homicide is a woman.

Q. It's a little broader than spousal homicide; is that right?

A. Yes. That's -- it's broader.

Q. Are your familiar, Dr. Dutton, with the research methods used in
literature that you reviewed, to render your opinion, to form an
opinion?

A. Yes, I am.

Q. And are those research methods new research methods?

A. No, they're not new research methods; they've been in use for some
time.

Q. Do you have any idea how long they've been in use?

A. Well, the actual process of looking at both archival -- using
archival interview methods to study perpetrators has been in use since
the '30s. The specific application to spousal homicide and issues
having to do with intimate violence is new. We're -- because most of
the research on intimate violence really began in 1970s.

Q. Okay. Do the people who do the research, including yourself, in
intimate homicide, use the same methods of research that have been
used since the '30s?

A. Yes, they have.

Q. There's no new scientific technique applied to that research?

A. No. It's -- no. Essentially, the techniques are pretty much the
same.

Q. And do you use those methods?

A. Yes, I do.

Q. And are those the research methods that you're familiar with?

Are those generally accepted in the field of research psychology?

A. They're generally accepted. They're published in the research
journals. And in order to be published in a journal, it has to pass
peer review. If it's not an acceptable method, it wouldn't get
published.

Q. Can you briefly describe the research method used.

A. Well, in terms of examining spousal homicide, what you usually do
is, to start with a known group of offenders, and to obtain all the
archival material that's available, which means all of the police
records, coroners' records, any kind of medical or psychological or
psychiatric records that would be in that man's file.

And wherever possible, to go back and talk to what is called a "proxy"
for the victim. That is someone who knew the victim well and could
speak to the circumstances that were occurring in the relationship
between the offender and the victim prior to the victim's death.

Q. And in the peer reviewed articles that you discussed in the
journals, is the research methodology routinely laid out?

A. Yes; it has -- you have to describe your methodology in order for
the article to be published.

Q. And, Dr. Dutton, is it generally accepted in the field of family
violence that there are certain factors that are indeed characteristic
of spousal homicide, or intimate homicides, rather?

A. Yes, there are.

MR. GELBLUM: Nothing further.

CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. LEONARD

Q. Nice to see you again.

A. Hi.

THE COURT: Apparently, it's not mutual.

(Laughter.)

MR. LEONARD: I resemble (sic) that remark.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) It sounds to me like you're testifying as an
expert on homicide; is that right, or you plan to testify?

A. Well, I'm testifying on a form of family violence, which is an
extension of other forms of family violence, but it's still an extreme
form of family violence, called homicide.

Q. Can you answer my question?

A. I thought I just did.

Q. Are you attempting to -- to tell this Court that you will be
testifying at the trial as an expert on homicide?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. Asked and answered.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: I will be testifying about characteristics of spousal
homicides.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Are you an expert on homicide, generally, sir?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. Irrelevant, not being offered on that.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: Can you tell me what you mean by "homicide, generally?"

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Well, you testified at your deposition that you
weren't an expert on homicide, you were an expert on spousal homicide.
Do you remember that?

A. Yes, I do.

Q. Okay.

That's what I meant.

A. Okay.

I consider myself to be an expert on spousal violence and spousal
homicide.

Q. Okay. But what you're intending to do here is, you're intending to
take the stand, and as I understand it, testify as to a pattern or
profile of spousal homicide, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Without applying it to the facts in the case, right?

That's what the moving papers say.

A. I don't believe we'll be applying it specifically to facts in this
case.

Q. Okay.

A. It will be characteristics of spousal homicides in general.

Q. Just in the abstract?

A. Compared to nonintimate homicide.

Q. Well, but you're not an expert in anything else. How can you
compare it?

A. I can read the literature.

Q. If you do take the stand and I have the pleasure of cross-examining
you, you'll agree that you're not an expert in anything but spousal
homicide, right?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. Misstates the testimony.

THE WITNESS: Well, I don't know what else I can say. I'm an expert in
spousal violence, and that includes spousal homicide.

And I would just like to add one thing to that: In examining the
characteristics of spousal homicides, one compares them to nonintimate
homicides.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Well, that puzzles me. Because in your deposition,
I tried to do that. Do you remember?

I asked you questions about -- you mentioned something about wound
appearance or use of a knife or something. Do you remember that? Do
you recall that?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

And I asked you, "Well, wait a minute. Aren't there -- isn't that kind
of weapon used in other types of homicides?"

Do you remember that question?

A. Yes, I do.

Q. And you said, "I can't answer that. I'm not an expert in anything
but spousal homicide."

Do you remember that, sir?

A. Yes, I do.

Q. How are you going to be of any help to this jury if you can't
answer something as basic as that?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. Irrelevant, argumentative.

THE WITNESS: I don't --

THE COURT: Excuse me.

Well, at this point, it would appear to me that, based upon the offer
that the plaintiff has made, the Court has not the foggiest notion of
what this witness's testimony is going to be and would tend to
exclude.

MR. GELBLUM: May I reopen, then?

MR. PETROCELLI: Explain.

MR. GELBLUM: I can have him, if you like, Your Honor. That's what I
should do, probably, is have him testify about the factors that he
identified as there -- that have been characteristics of spousal
homicide.

THE COURT: The reason I mention that at this point is, Mr. Leonard has
intimated, by his question to this witness, something about use of
knife and appearance of injury. And I'm at a loss as to what the
proffered testimony is going to be, re factors -- characteristics of
spousal homicide.

MR. GELBLUM: I'll be happy to elicit that.

THE COURT: Go ahead.

MR. GELBLUM: Can you tell us, please, Dr. Dutton --

MR. LEONARD: You want me to sit down?

MR. GELBLUM: You can stay up.

MR. LEONARD: You want me to stay here?

THE COURT: You can sit down. You're possibly going to be standing for
a long time.

MR. LEONARD: I don't think so.


DIRECT EXAMINATION (REOPENED) BY MR. GELBLUM:

Q. Can you tell us, Dr. Dutton, what factors you have determined are
characteristic of spousal homicide?

A. Well, if we EXAMINE the research literature, we find, for example,
that one factor that's characteristic of spousal homicide is a
previous violence of -- previous history of violence in the family
between the eventual perpetrator and victim of the homicide.

In fact, it magnifies the risks by a factor of eight. That's one of
the characteristics or one of the factors that I will be testifying,
or I'll been describing.

Another factor is descriptions of jealousy that come out of the
reports and in the literature reports that -- where the perpetrator's
described as jealous to the point of obsessing over the eventual
homicide victim.

Another factor is an estrangement, which is a major risk factor. Most
women who are killed are killed, first of all, by a man that they knew
in an intimate relationship during the first two months of
estrangement.

That's pretty well established in at least five or six separate
research articles, including one of the books that Lenore Walker has
written, Terrifying_Love, where she talks about that being an
especially dangerous and risky time.

Q. Lenore Walker is a defense expert in this case?

A. That's right.

So, we'll be testifying about all of those particular issues.

And then, of course, there is an issue that I think Mr. Leonard was
alluding to, the use of overkill, and whether or not the pattern of
killing is one that -- well, it's described in the literature as being
excessive, as more than is required to dispatch or kill a victim. So
there's numerous stab wounds or numerous blows or numerous shots
fired. So it's what's called a rage killing.

Q. That's one of the characteristics of spousal homicide in the
literature?

A. That's right.

Q. You found that in your own research, as well?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay. Have you found it -- has the literature found -- and has your
research found that stalking is one of the characteristics?

MR. LEONARD: Your Honor, I know it's only you here, but I do object to
the leading.

THE COURT: It's only me.

Go ahead.

THE WITNESS: Stalking and threats are two other -- two other aspects
that have shown up and been described in most of the risk assessment
lists that are checklists, that are made to determine lethality.

So stalking and threats would both be important. And stalking, of
course, is important because it indicates a kind of obsession, where
the perpetrators are unwilling or unable to let go of at relationship
with a subsequent victim.

Q. Is there a general acceptance in the family violence community that
the notion -- that these factors are characteristics of spousal
homicide?

A. Yes, there is.

MR. GELBLUM: Thank you.

THE COURT: Okay. You may cross-examine.

CROSS-EXAMINATION (RESUMED) BY MR. LEONARD

Q. Do you recall at page 117 of your deposition, answering the
following questions?

Starting at 9: (Reading):

"Now, you talked about overkill, and by that you mean -- Describe
that. What do you mean by that?"

Your answer: "Well, there's a number of Stab wounds; the judgment
being it's more than sufficient to kill someone.

"Basically that's it."

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Do you recall that?

A. Yes, I do.

Q. Next question (reading):

"Now, each of these, what you've just described as factors in
homicide, spousal homicide, obviously, they could be factors in other
types of homicide.

"I mean, there are, for instance, serial murderers around that use a
particular MO, where they will stab the victim multiple times.

"A. I'm not an expert on that."

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Do you remember that?

A. Yes.

Q. (Reading:) "Q. You're not?

"A. No."

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Do you remember that?

A. Yes.

Q. (Reading:) "Q. You're not aware of any other types of -- are you
aware, in general, of other types of homicides?

"A. I'm aware. I'm not an expert."

THE WITNESS: Um-hum.

MR. LEONARD: (Reading:)

"Q. I'm asking you -- obviously, there are other types of murders and
other motives and other types of perpetrators where this MO could be
seen at the victim's home, right? ... Overkill as you describe it,
correct?"

(Continued reading as follows:)

"Q. Correct?

"A. Yes."

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) At that point, Mr. Gelblum interjects and says,
he's already said he's not an expert in other kinds of homicide. And
you agreed with that. Do you remember that?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay. Now, my question is: If you're not an expert on other kinds
of homicide, how can you make the comparison between spousal homicide,
as you've described it, at least the profile of spousal homicide, and
other types of homicide?

How can you do that and how can you testify to that in front of this
jury?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection.

THE WITNESS: First of all, you're talking about one of several factors
you've outlined here, which is the modus operandi.

Secondly, in most of the research articles that I'm referring to,
there are, in fact, specific comparisons made between spousal homicide
and other forms of homicide.

I am able and willing to comment on the conclusions drawn by the
people who did that research.

Q. Now, you will -- you will acknowledge that what you're doing is,
you're going to sit there and you're going to describe the typical
pattern that you believe exists in spousal homicide, and just leave it
at that; and that will be the end of your testimony, correct?

A. I wouldn't characterize it that way. I would say that I'm going to
summarize the findings of a number of independent researchers, which
shows several prevalent characteristics that are associated with
spousal homicide.

Q. But you don't intend to apply those risk factors to the facts of
this case, correct?

A. Well, seems to me that's up to the jury to do that.

Q. Okay. And again, you're not able to make comparisons between other
types of homicides because you're not an expert.

MR. GELBLUM: Objection.

THE WITNESS: No, I didn't say that. I said that there are comparisons
that are made in the literature by other people who do, in fact,
compare spousal and other forms of homicide in that literature, and
that I could make those differences, those comparisons explicit.

Q. Are you familiar with an article -- I think you mentioned in your
deposition, prediction of homicide of and by battered women, by
Jacqueline Campbell.

A. Yes.

Q. Do you find that to be an authoritative treatise on the subject?

A. It's one study of many. I don't think it's necessarily one of the
better empirical studies.

Q. It's something you relied on -- at least that's what you testified
to in your deposition -- something you relied on in rendering your
opinion?

A. I looked at it.

Q. Right?

A. Um-hum.

Q. And how often -- you say you've testified in what, eight or nine
cases; is that right?

A. Um-hum.

Q. And is it fair to say that in each and every one of those cases,
you were called as an expert on the question of the mental state of a
defendant who had already been identified; is that true, sir?

In other words, either for the defense that was asserting a
battered-woman-syndrome defense, correct?

A. Um-hum.

Q. Isn't that true?

A. Just running through the cases, yes, I believe that's true.

Q. You've never -- you've never been permitted to testify, based on
your pattern or your profile, as to the issue of whether or not a
defendant did the crime, that is, the identity of the defendant; isn't
that correct, sir?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. No foundation as to permit it. Irrelevant
whether he ever tried to do that.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: That's correct.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Do you agree with this proposition:

It is not appropriate for formal prediction -- strike that.

That the notion of danger assessment or risk assessment, okay, is not
appropriate for formal prediction as in court sentencing situations,
in its current state of development.

Do you agree with that or not, sir?

A. I think that the whole issue of prediction is a red herring and is
irrelevant. And what I -- what goes on in court has nothing to do with
prediction, and an event has already happened.

What you're trying to do is match up the characteristics of that event
with known characteristics of a similar event; you're not trying to
predict something.

Q. What -- so what you're doing, you're profiling something. That's
what it's called?

A. Well --

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. Irrelevant.

THE WITNESS: It's a little misleading because it talks about a
profiler, describing a set of prevalent and frequently occurring
characteristics that attend upon a particular kind of activity.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) And you want to -- you want to present the profile
to the jury, but you don't want to give an opinion as to whether or
not the profile applies to this case; is that your intention?

A. That's the intention.

Q. And do you think that all of the significant factors in the profile
exist in this case?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. Vague. What profile?

THE COURT: Agree on "what profile."

MR. GELBLUM: He seems to be looking at some piece of paper.

MR. LEONARD: I'll put it down.

MR. GELBLUM: Fine.

MR. LEONARD: That make you feel better?

Don't know.

THE COURT: Let's not talk among ourselves.

THE WITNESS: Can you repeat the question?

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) You talked about a profile. Does the situation in
this case fit the profile?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. Irrelevant. He's not going to be asked to
testify to that.

MR. LEONARD: If I may be heard.

THE COURT: Doesn't look right. The printout doesn't look like --
right. It's not what I heard.

MR. LEONARD: The question was, do the facts of this case, as you
understand it, fit the profile that you have in your mind as to
spousal homicide? That's the question.

THE COURT: Go ahead and answer.

THE WITNESS: Yes.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) All of the significant factors --

A. Yes.

Q. -- is that right?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay. Would you agree that one of the significant factors is the
use of a weapon in a prior abusive incident?

Do you agree with that, sir?

A. Now you're reading from -- you're reading from Jacqueline
Campbell's list.

Q. I don't you know what -- I don't know what your profile is, so it's
hard.

A. I'm talking about the factors that I just described.

Q. Okay. Describe them again.

A. History of family violence, jealousy, estrangement, stalking,
threats, overkill.

Q. Okay. Let's start with threats.

Was there any evidence of threats in this case, sir?

A. I believe there was.

Are we going to get into all the evidence?

Q. I want to know if, when you sit in front of this jury and you
describe what you think is a pattern, that it's fair; that it actually
applies to this case. Because otherwise --

A. Yeah.

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. It's not a question. He's making a speech.
It's argumentative. It's irrelevant to this hearing. There's very
narrow issues in -- on this hearing. This isn't one of them.

THE COURT: I'll allow some cross-examination.

Go ahead.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) What evidence of threats is there in this case,
sir?

A. Are we going to go into all the evidence now?

THE COURT: Just answer the question.

THE WITNESS: Okay.

THE COURT: Don't argue with him.

THE WITNESS: Okay.

A number of witnesses that I read, reported Nicole Brown Simpson
describing threats being made to her by O.J. Simpson.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Name one.

A. Cora Fischman.

Q. Okay. So if Cora Fischman doesn't testify at this trial that there
were threats made, what would you say about that, sir?

A. If none of the people who testified "there were threats made,"
testified at the trial, then, we couldn't apply it.

Q. Okay. And it wouldn't be fair to sit in front of a jury and talk
about factors or part of a pattern that aren't applicable to the case;
do you agree with that?

MR. GELBLUM: It's irrelevant about what's fair and not fair.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) How did you determine, sir, that you could even
sit on the stand and talk about a pattern of spousal abuse if you're
not applying it to the facts in the case?

Tell me how you did that.

MR. GELBLUM: I -- objection. Vague, as I don't understand the
question.

THE COURT: A bit argumentative.

I don't quite understand what you're getting at.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Now, can you testify to a reasonable degree of
medical certainty, that the factors that you've identified are
applicable to this case?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. Irrelevant. He's not a physician, Your Honor.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) A reasonable degree of psychological certainty?

A. I -- Yes.

Q. Okay. And you are basing that on third-party reports that you've
read, correct, primarily?

A. I'm basing it on the domestic violence books from the criminal
trial. I'm basing it on interviews that I made personally with Dennis
Brown, Judith Brown, Bruce Jenner, Giaconda Redfern.

I'm basing it on testimony that was given at the criminal trial. I'm
basing it on depositions that were given by O.J. Simpson, statements
of him -- by him. And I'm basing it on that material.

Q. And when you do that, sir, you're making an independent judgment as
to the veracity of these statements or as to the fact that some of the
statements aren't credible; isn't that right?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection, Your Honor. It's beyond the scope of what this
witness is being offered for. He is only being offered to describe the
factors that exist.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Again, you have never been permitted to testify in
a court of law about factors relating to spousal homicide when the
issue was the identity of the perpetrator of a murder; is that
correct, sir?

A. That is correct.

MR. LEONARD: No further questions.

REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. GELBLUM:

Q. Have you ever been asked to testify on that subject before in a
court of law and been turned down?

A. Never.

MR. GELBLUM: Nothing further.

THE COURT: You may step down.

(The witness stood aside.)

THE COURT: You may proceed.

MR. GELBLUM: Your Honor, we have no further witnesses. Those are the
only witnesses.

MR. LEONARD: I don't have any witnesses.

THE COURT: Okay. Go ahead.

MR. GELBLUM: First of all, Your Honor, we discussed the appropriate
standard. And it is our very, very strong and firm position that the
appropriate standard is simply Evidence Code 801, and not the Kelly
Frye standard, if the Kelly Frye standard applies. We've been
listening to testimony that meets all prongs of that test.

Under the California Supreme Court case People_v._Stoll, Kelly Frye
does not apply unless you have two factors present: One, the opinion
and methods used are derived from new scientific techniques and
procedures.

The testimony, I think, clearly shows that is not the case here.

THE COURT: Well, you're talking about two different people.

MR. GELBLUM: Yes, absolutely. And I do want to keep them separate.

THE COURT: I suggest you do.

MR. GELBLUM: Okay.

My position, of course, is that for each of them, neither of them is
testifying to a matter that is developed from new scientific
techniques and procedures.

In addition, neither Dr. Dietz nor Dr. Dutton -- I don't think their
testimony runs any risk, in the words of Stoll, carrying a misleading
aura of scientific infallibility. And if that's the case, Kelly Frye
simply does not apply.

This is not fingerprints or voice prints; it doesn't appear to have a
single, clear-cut answer.

In Dr. Dutton's case from the research that are characteristics of
spousal homicides.

In Dr. Dietz's case, his personal opinion based on his experience and
all the other things that he mentioned, the literature, in the field
and his many years of work in the field as to what you can tell from
the crime scene as to motive and what you can tell from the other
features that he talked about the relationship between the parties,
prior relationship between priors -- prior behavior of parties and
what what you can determine from motive.

Dr. Dietz has been able to testify on many occasions on both of those
issues repeatedly. He cited some of those cases more in his C.V. This
is more common expert testimony which has been received in California
courts and other courts.

THE COURT: I don't -- I haven't seen one case in which Dr. Dietz's
type of testimony has been offered to establish identity. Not one.

MR. GELBLUM: Your Honor, we cited People_v._ Phillips.

THE COURT: I read it.

MR. GELBLUM: Okay. The Munchausen syndrome by proxy case.

THE COURT: That was not an identity case.

MR. GELBLUM: Defendant denied.

THE COURT: That was a mother case.

MR. GELBLUM: The mother; I'm sorry. The mother --

THE COURT: It wasn't an identity case.

MR. GELBLUM: The mother denied committing the acts. And the issue was,
before she had committed the acts; the issue here is whether Mr.
Simpson committed acts --

THE COURT: The child was in the care of the mother. The child died of
a series of medical conditions. And the expert testimony had to do
with the interpretation of those medical happenstances as her history
progressed and the testimony from the expert with regards to what
constitutes Munchausen syndrome. And that formed a possible basis for
her motivation.

MR. GELBLUM: To show that she did it, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Yes.

MR. GELBLUM: Good. That's exactly Dr. Dietz.

THE COURT: It wasn't very much of a question, who was going to be
responsible, if anybody at all, in this case, was it?

MR. GELBLUM: I don't know if that's the appropriate analysis.

THE COURT: Who else were they going to point the finger at? Anybody?

MR. GELBLUM: If it wasn't her, then they had nobody.

THE COURT: Right.

MR. GELBLUM: Same thing here. If it's not Mr. Simpson, then we don't
have anybody. The issue is, who did it? The issue is whether the
person charged with this committed it.

THE COURT: And in Phillips, the question is whether or not she died of
natural causes, natural progression of her illness, as opposed to
maltreatment.

MR. GELBLUM: The issue was whether this defendant had deliberately --

THE COURT: We know what the victims of this case died of. It wasn't
because of --

MR. GELBLUM: It was whether she had done it -- it was whether she had
done it deliberately.

THE COURT: I don't agree with your argument.

MR. GELBLUM: We've also cited other issues in court in People v.
Robbins and People v. Poptoes (phonetic), where psychiatric testimony
as to motive was permitted.

That's exactly what Dr. Dietz proposes to testify about. Dr. Dietz
himself talked about the Davis case, the Polly Klaas case, where he
was permitted to testify based on crime-scene analysis of whether the
defendant had committed a certain act, and what his motive would have
been for committing that act.

Dr. Dietz also testified that there were -- I forget the number -- he
cited several cases where he had, in fact been permitted to testify
may not be recorded decision but there are trial courts that allow
that testimony besides the civil murder case cited it was an Atlanta
case; the civil murder case of a South Carolina case; an Ohio case in
which he had been allowed to testify on this exact same topic, as he
said from the stand under oath. That's unchallenged testimony; he has
been allowed to testify.

In fact -- and the defense has taken the position in their opening
statements, Your Honor, that Mr. Simpson had no motive to kill; he
never would have killed the mother of his children; Mr. Baker said he
had no motive.

We obviously are not legally required to prove motive as a practical
matter. He wants to put on evidence of motive; that's what Dr. Dietz
is there for.

THE COURT: Wasn't this case where there's ample evidence on which a
lay jury can look to ascertain whether there was motive and they don't
need an expert to testify to matters of common experience with regards
to the existence or nonexistence of whether it would appear you're
offering this expert to give plaintiffs' version of their
interpretation of what the evidence is with regards to motive. And in
essence, you're having somebody whose credentials make a closing
argument for you with regards to how they should review the evidence.

MR. GELBLUM: I think that hits the nail on the head, the issue on the
head.

THE COURT: Exactly.

MR. GELBLUM: I'm going to come to a different conclusion than you do.
I don't think that motives for homicides are a part of ordinary
jurors' knowledge. They're certainly not part of mine I luckily never
witnessed one, never been part of one, and I don't know what motivates
people to murder.

I also, frankly, Your Honor, think this defendant is a different
defendant than most defendants in cases like this.

Because of his celebrity status, many of the jurors feel like they
know this person, feel like they know something about him. In most
cases, the defendant is in court and the jurors know nothing about the
defendant other than what they see in court.

THE COURT: We're going through a whole bunch of motions in limine in
which the Court has already delineated what kind of evidence you're
going to be able to offer. And you certainly are aware that you're
going to be offering a considerable amount of evidence that the jury
is not privy to.

So how do you say that?

MR. GELBLUM: I'm sorry, Your Honor. I don't understand what you're
saying. I apologize.

THE COURT: Well, I don't think I can explain myself any better than
what I did.

MR. GELBLUM: I apologize, but I think it is. I think it is
particularly important in this case with this particular defendant,
and particularly with the position that the defense is taking, that
there just was no possible motive for this man to do this; he
wouldn't; there's no way he could have done this.

And this witness is capable of testifying, is qualified to testify,
and has been allowed to testify that, in fact, what you see isn't
necessarily what you get. People like this do have motives and can and
are capable of killing.

And that is not, I think, Your Honor -- I think to be fair, that is
not within the experience of the jurors. I think that we probably
weeded out people who had direct contact with homicide.

With a murder, those were people who may have been not on the jury. I
don't think these jurors do know what drives people to kill. They can
imagine, you know, but this isn't a situation, you know, where the
things you see in the movies, where a husband comes home and sees the
wife in bed with somebody else, or they're trying to protect from
immediate assault. This is something that I think is outside of the
understanding of the ordinary juror.

They can benefit from Section 801. All we need to do, the testimony
needs to be relevant and helpful to the jurors' understanding of the
issues. And I don't think there really can be any doubt of that.

THE COURT: You left out another thing that one talks about.

MR. GELBLUM: What's that?

THE COURT: It has to be beyond the common experience of jurors. Unless
people have been living in a vacuum for the totality of their lives,
the motivations that -- based upon your motion in limine, that the
jurors' going to be exposed to those, are not items that are out of
the common experience of man.

MR. GELBLUM: Motivations for murder are. I don't think we have any
jurors who have had a family member murdered or a close friend
murdered. I think we asked those questions. I don't think we have
anybody -- and frankly, I think that murder obviously is an extreme
form of human behavior, as extreme as it gets, and it is not within
the jurors' experience to know what drives somebody to do that. It's
just not.

You see a lot of movies, you can read books.

THE COURT: If Dr. Dietz's testimony is being offered to prove that,
based upon Dr. Dietz opinion as to motive, that you've made your case,
I think we have a real problem, in conjunction with all the cases that
both sides have cited.

MR. GELBLUM: We're not offering them as the have-all, end-all of our
case; it's one more relevant piece of evidence in the Bledsoe case.

THE COURT: I'm really concerned with the analysis of cases you offer
compared to the analysis in People_v._Bowker,_203_Cal.App.3d,_385 and
People_v. Bledsoe,_36_Cal.3d,_236.

MR. GELBLUM: Your Honor, Bledsoe and Bowker -- Bowker talks about
Bledsoe being a predictor. And we're not talking about prediction
here.

THE COURT: I think that's essentially what you're trying to -- that's
what you just finished talking to me about for ten minutes.

I don't know you realize it that's what you're talking --

MR. GELBLUM: I'm not talking about predicting what's going to happen.
I'm saying you have a crime; you have to figure out what happened;
that's very important. A distinction that the defense tries to muddy.

We have a completed crime here and we're trying to figure out what
happened. We're not going forward and predicting what may happen in
the future.

Bledsoe, Your Honor, the key distinction to Bledsoe, as I recall it,
was that child abuse

syndrome -- child abuse syndrome when it disallowed the testimony
because -- primarily because, if not solely, because the syndrome was
developed for therapeutic purposes, not to identify whether somebody
was abused. It was developed to help people who were identified as
sufferers of child abuse to deal with it. And the court said that's
not what you're trying to do here. We can't mix apples with oranges.

Dr. Dietz, as he testified, the crime-scene analysis, as well as the
motives, he's doing it exactly as he uses it in real life, exactly how
law enforcement, coroner, medical professionals use it in real life,
to figure out who committed the crime, to help figure out who did it,
to help identify the perpetrator. It's exactly how it's used in
Bledsoe and Bowker.

There's a distinction. I think it's a proper distinction. It's right I
decided because they're not applicable here because we are using the
methodology in precisely the way it was meant to be used, which was to
help to identify, or to narrow the range of people who could have
committed this. That's the response on Bledsoe, Your Honor.

I think it's not that if it was a be-all, end-all, we wouldn't put all
this evidence up and get him out and say who you do think did it.
Simpson he's not even going to say what he said in his deposition.
He's not going to say Simpson did it.

THE COURT: I think that's the --

MR. GELBLUM: No. There's two parts of his testimony, two very distinct
parts: The crime-scene analysis part, this simply looks like this was
committed by somebody who was in a rage, as opposed to a burglary,
drug hit, or any other kind of thing. This looks like somebody who was
in a rage and had an extreme emotional reaction and attachment to one
of the victims, probably Nicole.

He can determine that by, we didn't go into it all day, but by the
evidence found at the scene, by the wound pattern, the nature and
extent of the wounds.

The other -- and that's not saying Mr. Simpson. That's saying that I
think it's clear that somebody like this.

Now, if it just so happens Mr. Simpson is the only person in the world
with that, well, that's the facts; those are the facts. But he's not
saying Simpson did it.

Secondly, the other opinion is quite distinct. I'm assuming Mr.
Simpson is very -- assuming Mr. Simpson did it. I'm saying is there
some motive that I see in all the information I have about the prior
relationship between these people, and the other things that he
mentioned that would be based on my experience of looking at thousands
of homicides in my career, it would say that this person had a motive
or a likely -- had a motive to commit this crime.

And the jury will be told he's assuming he did it. Obviously, it's
their province. He's not going to mislead the jury in any way. He's
not saying this infallible. He's saying this is my opinion. He very
carefully -- he's going to be cross-examined -- lay out a foundation
for his opinion.

Again, this is testimony that is admitted frequently, as Dr. Dietz
testified, where he is not going to ever say, unless Mr. Leonard wants
him to, that he thinks Mr. Simpson did it. It's not his job.

He's doing two very different things: One, assuming he did it, I can
see a likely motive here based on my vast experience and knowledge;
and two, the crime scene shows this is somebody who had an emotional
attachment, was in a rage against Nicole.

And that's it. And it's that simple. And it goes no further than that.

The jury is certainly capable. We have a very intelligent jury here.
This jury certainly is capable of taking that information for whatever
it's worth; it will be subject to rigorous cross-examination; and they
can weigh it and everything.

I think everything that Mr. Leonard has brought up goes to the weight
of that testimony. It's certainly admissible; it's relevant testimony;
and if the jury wants to discard it, they can discard it. It will be
shown for exactly what it is, nothing more, nothing less.

THE COURT: You're finished with everything?

MR. GELBLUM: That's Dr. Dietz.

MR. LEONARD: Can I respond?

THE COURT: Why don't you wait?

MR. GELBLUM: I did want to make sure, Your Honor, we did have a
footnote. Couple parts of his testimony may be offered in rebuttal,
beyond what we -- but I thought we'd save that for later. We didn't
even talk about it today. That's his analysis of Mr. Simpson's
prehomicide and posthomicide demeanor. That would be rebuttal,
depending on what they put on in their case, Your Honor. We weren't
intending to address that today.

With respect to Dr. Dutton, again from the completely different point
of view, Dr. Dietz is a forensic psychiatrist. You have heard what he
does.

Dr. Dutton is a research psychologist; he's not even going to opine as
to whether the factors are present here. He's going to opine, look,
this is what I do, I've been doing this for 23 years; I'm good at
this. I wrote books on this. People ask me to edit journals on this.
I've read. I'm familiar with large amounts of research on this. People
have done empirical studies and then I share good research
methodologies. These are factors present in a spousal homicide: Boom,
boom, boom, boom.

Again, helpful to the jury to try to analyze whether, in fact, these
murders were a spousal or intimate homicide.

Again, not even close to representation of some infallible,
scientific, foolproof, scientific test. It's one man's opinion, as
well as it's one man's just -- really, disclosure of what the research
out there shows, and there is a general consensus of the research that
these are the factors generally accepted in the field that he
testified to.

And the jury can take that, and again, they can take it for what it
is, and their reaction to it, and go to the weight of it. But it's
beyond me that it's not relevant; it certainly can help them
understand these crimes.

And Dr. Dutton can say when you have these factors present, the
research shows that these are factors that are characteristic with
spousal homicide. The jury can decide whether those factors are
present. The jury can also decide whether Dr. Dutton is full of hot
air. It's up to them. But he's certainly qualified to render his
opinion. He knows the material, and he would be offering this to help
the jury analyze the evidence in the case.

And certainly, that's clearly something that would be far beyond the
understanding of the jurors, as to what the characteristics are of
spousal homicide. There's no way they could possibly know that without
all the research Dr. Dutton has done.

Thank you.

MR. LEONARD: Your Honor, just very briefly.

I think that, despite Mr. Gelblum's very brave attempt to characterize
this evidence as something other than profiling, that's exactly what
it is. Both of the witnesses were very candid about that. That's
precisely the kind of evidence that has been found to be inadmissible
time and again, for a very important reason.

And that is, that it does invade the province of the jury,
particularly in the case of Dr. Dietz, where he quite candidly admits
that he simply assimilates all of this information, decides for
himself on criteria that we could never fathom what is true and what
isn't, and then sort of pontificates to the jury about his opinion as
to what he believes and what he doesn't, and then applies it to a set
of facts to the case, and somehow at the end of this process, renders
an opinion that -- basically that Mr. Simpson did it because he had
the motive to do it.

As he said, again, in his deposition, as I pointed out, he's basically
trying to tell this jury that Mr. Simpson did it because he's the kind
of person that would do it.

And we obviously know that that is an absolute violation of basic
principles in our system of juris prudence, which is that if it's a
tort or a crime, the person that needs to be found liable or guilty of
committing the crime not of being someone who would commit the crime.

Propensity is an absolute; it's something that is absolutely barred
and inadmissible. That's precisely what Dr. Dietz is doing.

I also find it curious that Mr. Gelblum, on the one hand, says the
jury is intelligent enough to try to pick through what I found to be a
little bit confusing testimony by Dr. Dietz, in particular, and try to
figure out what is accurate and what isn't, and what they should
believe and what they shouldn't, and yet is not intelligent enough and
doesn't have the common sense that we all have to try to apply the
facts, not opinions, but the facts that Your Honor will permit them to
elicit with regard to motive, whether it be the prior relationships of
the parties or activities of Mr. Simpson, so forth and so on. I find
that to be a little bit of talking out of both sides of his mouth.

I think in a way, Dr. Dutton's testimony is more dangerous, if you
will, and I think the court in Bowler stated that --

THE COURT: It's Bowker.

MR. LEONARD: Bowker. Excuse me.

But on page 3 of our memorandum or our brief, it was precisely this
situation where they tried to put on an expert, just to throw out the
bare bones of the syndrome, without applying it to the facts.

And the Court said while the improprieties in the admission of this
type of evidence is clear as to where the expert testimony applies
this syndrome to the facts of the case -- and I'm paraphrasing -- in
fact, there may be more danger -- this is a quote -- "where the
application is left for the jury because jurors' education and
training may not have sensitized them to the dangers of drawing
predicted conclusions."

And I think, again, I think that Dr. Dietz's testimony is clearly
inadmissible under Bledsoe and Bowker, and in a number of other cases
in other jurisdictions that we've pointed out.

THE COURT: You talking about Deitz or Dutton?

MR. LEONARD: I'm talking about Deitz, but Dutton --

THE COURT: You started out with Dutton --

MR. LEONARD: I'm sorry.

THE COURT: -- and ended up with Dr. Dietz. I was wondering where
you're going.

MR. LEONARD: Two Ds.

Dr. Dietz is clearly inadmissible.

Dr. Dutton, on the other hand, it's hard for me to understand how his
testimony is relevant. If they just throw out, put them on the stand,
throw out the syndrome, he says -- again he said a couple of times, as
I pointed out, that he apparently isn't in a very good position to
compare homicides.

I found that strange in his deposition when he responded to my
questions, and yet, he's going to sit on the stand and just throw out
the pattern for the jury, leaving them to their devices.

Now, obviously, that puts us in the position, Your Honor, of calling a
counter-expert and, you know, if we have to, we will. And we'll -- you
know, this will extend the trial, I think. You have -- you have a --
certainly have the power to limit testimony, for no other reason than
it's really not going to be that helpful for the jury; it could
confuse the jury; and it's going to extend the trial.

So I think both the Dutton and Deitz testimony is inadmissible.

I think that the Deitz testimony has the additional infirmation that
he's totally usurping the power and the duty of the jury by, you know,
basically telling them, oh, I thought about all these things; I
weighed this evidence and that evidence or this report and that
report, and this deposition, many, many of which are going to be
inadmissible. He's looked at a whole bunch of material.

I can't imagine that half of it is going to actually end up on the
witness stand, or in admissible exhibits. And he's going to sit up
there and tell the jury what he believes. He's the expert. He believes
this witness but not that witness.

That evidence, that can't be admissible that has never been admissible
in a court of law. They haven't cited one case where it is.

MR. GELBLUM: We would never have him do that.

THE COURT: How about giving me a better understanding of your position
on Dutton?

MR. LEONARD: Well --

THE COURT: As I understand plaintiffs' offer of proof, they're going
to offer Dr. Dutton to show simply that a spousal homicide may have A,
B, C, D, E, F, G characteristics, period.

MR. LEONARD: Um-hum.

THE COURT: Nothing more.

MR. LEONARD: I don't know how to put it any more succinctly than the
Court did in Bowker.

If you look at page 3 of our brief, that's precisely what was
attempted in Bowker. It was found to be improper. And the reason was
that there may be more danger where the application of the syndrome is
left for the jury, because jurors' education and training may not have
sensitized them to the dangers of drawing predicted conclusions.

THE COURT: Let me take a look at your page 3.

MR. LEONARD: It's right in the offset quote, right in the middle.

THE COURT: That's where I'm looking.

(Pause in proceedings.)

THE COURT: Didn't the court have a problem in Bowker with the child
sexual abuse accommodation syndrome itself?

Didn't the court feel that the expert who formulated this child sexual
abuse accommodation syndrome was not able to support this syndrome or
pattern with sufficient foundation?

MR. LEONARD: Your Honor, the expert in that case didn't even try to
apply it to the case. He just sat up there like they want Dutton to
do; he didn't apply it to the case. He just described precisely -- he
did the precise thing that Dutton wants to do; and that is, to sit on
the stand and say, well, I have a certain pattern in my head. It may
not comport with the pattern in the literature, and here it is. And,
you know, knock yourself out, to the jury. You apply it.

I mean, that's something that doesn't belong in a court of law. That's
exactly what they're doing here.

THE COURT: Okay. Well, I'll take it under submission.

MR. GELBLUM: Can I ask just a couple more in response to Mr. Leonard?

THE COURT: Go ahead.

MR. GELBLUM: I thought the Court was interested in Bowker. I don't
know where Mr. Leonard started quoting in his brief. I suspect it was,
"While the impropriety."

Court look at the previous paragraph, which is really the relevant
paragraph, which says Bledsoe must be read:

"It is one thing to say that child abuse victims often exhibit a
certain characteristic or that a particular behavior is not
inconsistent with a child having been molested. It is quite another to
conclude that where a child meets certain criteria, we can predict
with a reasonable degree of certainty that he or she has been abused.
The former may be appropriate in some circumstances; the latter --
given the current state of scientific knowledge -- clearly is not."

And then the paragraph talking about the latter situation, which is
not what Dr. Dutton said, the latter situation being where the
testimony is, if a child meets certain criteria, we can predict with a
reasonable degree of certainty that he or she has been abused.

That's not what Dr. Dutton did. Dr. Dutton says the former, which is
what the Court says is okay, which is that victims of spousal
homicides often exhibit these characteristics. That's exactly what he
told you he is going to say. Under Bowker, this testimony is
admissible.

Secondly, Mr. Leonard argued that we just cannot be permitted to say
he's the kind of person who did it.

They're saying he's not the kind of person who did it. We've got to be
able to respond to say, they're wrong; yes, he is, at least in
rebuttal.

They're going to put that on in their case; I guarantee it. They've
already said it in opening statement, he's not the kind of person who
can do it.

We're entitled to prove he is the kind of person who can do it. That's
part of what the testimony is about.

And as to the relying on inadmissible evidence, the evidence code
clearly says experts can do that; they can rely on inadmissible
evidence, as long as it's the kind of evidence that's relied on by
experts in the field.

I think you listed each of those experts. They were relying on
material that is typically relied on by experts in their field.

Thank you.

MR. LEONARD: Your Honor, if what he said -- this is double talk. What
he's saying is that there are certain factors that exist in spousal
homicides. I mean, obviously, the factors existed before the homicide
occurred. If that isn't predictive, what's the relevance of putting
somebody up on the stand to talk about factors that exist if there
isn't the notion of predicting?

In other words, retroactively predicting. Why else would he be up
there?

I mean, he's saying that these factors exist. And when these factors
exist, we can assume or predict, whatever word you want, that
ultimately, there will be a homicide. That's what this is all about;
it's prediction. It's nothing else but prediction. Otherwise, it's not
relevant. Doesn't make any sense.

THE COURT: Okay. Thank you.

MR. GELBLUM: Thank you, Your Honor.

MR. PETROCELLI: Your Honor, we have the matter of the autopsy pictures
we'd like to take up now.

THE COURT: You've got one minute.

MR. PETROCELLI: Well, it's not our position, it's theirs. We intend to
use them tomorrow.

MR. BLASIER: Perhaps -- maybe it might be best to do it first thing in
the morning.

I was going to ask the Court to go over photographs that they intended
to use, to make a ruling as to the admissibility of the various
photographs.

MR. PETROCELLI: We have a lot of preparation in place. And for us to
-- tomorrow morning, to get a ruling that we can't use a lot of the
material, would be really prejudicial to us.

Dr. Spitz has come in from out of town, and we just heard about this
today. They wanted a hearing today, and here's where we are.

MR. BLASIER: I notified yesterday. I'm saying we can't do it in a
minute, is all I'm saying.

THE COURT: Well, how many pictures are you objecting to?

MR. BLASIER: I'm objecting to all of them. They intend to use all of
the exhibits that were used in the criminal trial, essentially all of
them, is what Mr. Medvene told me.

The coroner, in the criminal trial, testified for eight days. Every
single wound was described. And sounds explicit to the jury, in my
view for the purpose of inflaming the jury, not informing the jury.

There's very little controversy about the number of wounds, about the
type of wounds. There are a couple of wounds where there are some
issues involved.

I can see photographs would be appropriate for defense I have wound on
the hands, for instance, but there's really only one major ruling that
there's going to be controversy about: That's an abdominal wound to
Mr. Goldman, which I don't think they have photographs of tissue
inside the wound, which is what the relevant argument is going to be.

And it's our position that the photographs that are calculated to
inflame the jury, under 352, should be excluded.

THE COURT: How many are there?

MR. BLASIER: What's the total number?

Several boards with --

MR. MEDVENE: We have a number of boards.

THE COURT: How many pictures?

MR. MEDVENE: Approximately 35.

THE COURT: Why do you need 35 pictures?

MR. MEDVENE: Well, the pictures basically go to the issues that
defendants put in play. It's not just the cause of death, Your Honor.
The defendants have raised the length of the struggle, the nature of
the struggle, the amount of time that it took, could all of the wounds
have been caused by one assailant.

The pictures go to those issues.

And I might say, the examination, certainly compared to the criminal
trial, will be brief. I estimate the total examination on direct would
be -- with the pictures, will be in the area of two and a half hours,
give or take a few minutes, Your Honor.

So we intend to put in the pictures to show and to demonstrate our
point; that the struggle was in the area of a minute and not twenty
minutes, like the defendants contend, and to show the placement of
wounds and how the wounds could have been caused and placed by the
assailant within a relatively short period of time.

There's also a question in terms of what wound or wounds were the
fatal wound. And the pictures --

THE COURT: Mr. Medvene, without cutting you short, we'll go through
this tomorrow. I'm concerned that 35 photographs seem somewhat
excessive, without having seen the photographs.

MR. MEDVENE: We're talking about two different victims and two
different crime scenes, in effect, Your Honor, so you have -- About --

THE COURT: Mr. Medvene, I've only been in this business since 1963.

MR. MEDVENE: I understand, Your Honor.

THE COURT: And I've handled more than one homicide.

MR. MEDVENE: I understand.

THE COURT: And I must confess, never, ever seen that many photographs
in any homicide.

MR. MEDVENE: Fifteen pictures, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Autopsy photos? No, I haven't seen that many.

MR. PETROCELLI: Can we address this in the morning, Your Honor?

THE COURT: Yes, you may.

MR. PETROCELLI: Does court start at 9:00 tomorrow?

THE COURT: Yes.

MR. PETROCELLI: Thank you, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Thank you.

(At 4:30 P.M., an adjournment was taken until Friday, November 8,
1996, at 9:00 A.M.)

REPORTER'S DAILY TRANSCRIPT
NOVEMBER 8, 1996

SUPERIOR COURT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA
FOR THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES

SHARON RUFO, ET AL., N/A, PLAINTIFFS,

VS.

ORENTHAL JAMES SIMPSON, ET AL., DEFENDANTS.


SANTA MONICA, CALIFORNIA
FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 8, 1996
9:34 A.M.

DEPARTMENT NO. WEQ
HON. HIROSHI FUJISAKI, JUDGE

(REGINA D. CHAVEZ, OFFICIAL REPORTER)

THE COURT: Morning.

I understand counsel have worked out some stipulation with regards to
the exhibits that we're going to be ruling on this morning.

(The following exhibits were presented to the Court and marked for
identification purposes and retained by the Court: Plaintiffs' Exhibit
211; Plaintiffs' Exhibit 2142; Plaintiffs' Exhibit 2148; Plaintiffs'
Exhibit 2149; Plaintiffs; Exhibit 2150; Defendants' Exhibit 2147.)

MR. MEDVENE: If the Court please, we voluntarily eliminated -- of the
18 Ms. Nicole Brown photos, we eliminated all but five. And Mr. Baker
has an objection to one of those five, which is number 2014.

With respect to Mr. Goldman, we've eliminated 16 photos voluntarily,
and we're offering 10 of the original 26.

Of those ten, Mr. Baker is objecting to five. And those numbers are
1999, 2006, 2004, 2000 and 1986.

The number on the Ms. Brown photo that's being objected to is 2013.

The clerk has been kind enough to pull those photos for you, Your
Honor.

(Autopsy photograph of Ronald Goldman was marked Plaintiffs' Exhibit
1986 for identification.)

(Coroner's photograph of Ronald Goldman was marked Plaintiffs' Exhibit
1999 for identification.)

(Autopsy photograph of back of head was marked Plaintiffs' Exhibit
2000 for identification.)

(Autopsy photograph of side of head was marked Plaintiffs' Exhibit
2004 for identification.)

(Autopsy photograph of side of head and upper torso of was marked
Plaintiffs' Exhibit 2006 for identification.)

(Pause in proceedings.)

THE COURT: I'll hear from defense.

MR. BAKER: 352 -- I obviously don't have the photos in front of me
because I think the Court has those photos.

I think in looking at those photos, obviously the ones that have
probative value, we have not objected to.

The ones we feel the prejudicial effect far outweighs the probative
value that are exceedingly gruesome, I've objected to. And I've tried
to be relatively selective and only object to those that I feel that
have -- for example, 2013 is a photo that is pretty gory, and there
are other photos of that wound that we have not objected to.

20 -- 1986 also has exceedingly limited probative value, Your Honor.

And this is the one that I was just indicating to you, sir, 2013.

And again, if you look at 1999, there are other photos of that
particular wound.

And this one, I would suggest, is quite gruesome.

I don't feel strongly, Your Honor, about 2000, although I don't think
that it has very much probative value.

And again, I don't feel that strongly about 2004.

2006, I think, is very -- would certainly have on 2004 -- and if the
Court -- and the others that they've wanted to get in that we haven't
objected to, those will tell the story, I think, in great detail,
without getting quite as gory as some of these that we've objected to,
I'll submit, Your Honor.

MR. MEDVENE: Your Honor, we tried not to duplicate there's one I'd
suggest that maybe we can eliminate I believe we need the others.

The 2013 is the neck wound to Ms. Brown. We've only offered two
pictures of Ms. Brown with the serious wounds.

The importance of the neck wound is one important factor in the case
that the next witness is going to testify to, is the nature of the
injury where the assailant was standing, the fact that he was cutting
from one direction to another, from left to right.

This shows the wound quite clearly and permits him to explain, where
he's able to form an opinion, that the -- that the assailant had his
left arm over the victim when he cut right to left and slashed the
neck of the victim. And it shows -- because of the size increasing, it
demonstrates the basis for his opinion.

That's really the main picture on Ms. Brown, and one of the only two
neck pictures.

In terms of Mr. Goldman, we've eliminated most of the neck pictures.

1999 is the front of the neck.

2004 is the left side.

2000 is the right side.

We can do without 2006, if the Court pleases, in that it's covered in
one of the other three. But the other three are necessary, because we
want to show the struggle and the attempt to cut Mr. Goldman on the
left and the attempt to cut him on the right and the front, in terms
of similarity of modus operandi of the assailant to both victims. So
we don't believe there's any duplication there.

The last photo, 1986, is -- is a picture of Mr. Goldman, basically for
purpose of showing the left leg and the -- and the thigh, the result
of the thigh wound, and where the limited bleeding that's there was --
the limited external bleeding was that most of the bleeding was
internal, but this was basically the external bleeding.

We would submit, Your Honor --

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, we can block out the faces of these individuals
and still show the wounds.

THE COURT: Okay.

As to 2006, the Court will exclude that.

(Plaintiffs' Exhibit 2006 was excluded from presentation to the jury
by the Court.)

THE COURT: The remainder of the objection is overruled.

Okay. You ready for testimony?

MR. MEDVENE: Yes, Your Honor.

MR. GELBLUM: We have to go cover up that one photograph.

THE COURT: Okay.

MR. PETROCELLI: Your Honor.

MR. MEDVENE: Your Honor, there's one other point that we might take up
now, Your Honor, if it's agreeable.

We understand that the defense, Your Honor, that they might, on
cross-examination, use some sort of computer program that we were just
made aware of today. We don't know the nature of the computer program
in terms of how sophisticated, how rudimentary. We've not seen it
before. It seems to me, it's not impeachment document it's a document
that should have been listed so we have an opportunity to use it.

I might note that we were going to use several mannequins that we
listed on the board. Opposing counsel thought that they were at a
disadvantage with respect to them because we haven't shown them to
them.

I voluntarily did not use the mannequins, to be confronted with a
witness being examined with a computer program that hasn't been
verified. There's been no testimony about the program in terms of how
accurate it is, how crude or noncrude it is.

It would seem to us, it would be inappropriate. We think at a minimum,
it should be authenticated, and its accuracy should be authenticated.

We think it's too late to do that. It should have been listed already,
and we should have had an opportunity to examine it, and determine
just exactly how it worked and if it was accurate or not accurate in
particular areas. But to be confronted with it now, on cross, as if
it's an accurate demonstration of various body parts, we think, is not
well-founded and should not be permitted.

We might note also, it's not on the exhibit list.

The only reason we know about it is because it was being shown up on
the board, just to get it ready, and we first found out about it
today.

MR. BLASIER: Your Honor, what we intend to use is not a computer
program; it's simply anatomy charts on CD-ROM, with a readily
available -- like taking Gray's Anatomy and putting it on the Elmo.

It's not tailored to this case; it's not specific to the wounds in
this case; it's simply illustrative for the cross-examination for
impeachment purposes of this particular witness.

I'm happy to show these are routine anatomy charts that are used all
the time; they're noncontroversial. We intend to use it for
illustrative purposes.

In our opinion, it's not an exhibit; it's just illustrative evidence,
and ask that we should be allowed to use it.

MR. MEDVENE: As I said, we haven't seen it. We think the intent would
be to blow particular parts up. We don't know if it's accurate and --

THE COURT: Where's it from?

MR. BLASIER: It's called Adam, The Inside Story. It's simply a series
of anatomy charts on a computer, read into a book.

THE COURT: What is it called?

MR. BLASIER: Adam, The Inside Story, the 1987 edition. There are many
available that have been available and that are used by doctors.

THE COURT: Adam --

MR. BLASIER: Adam The Inside Story.

THE COURT: What's the source?

MR. BLASIER: There's another name of the program, Your Honor. The name
of the --

THE COURT: Who made it?

MR. BLASIER: Well, we can -- we'll be happy to show it. We can put it
up and you can see it.

THE COURT: Does it say who made it?

MR. BAKER: Adam Software, Inc., copyright 1996.

THE COURT: There's no authorship on it?

MR. BAKER: No.

If we put it up, it's like taking Gray's Anatomy, if we came up with
charts.

THE COURT: You put it on; let me see what it is.

(CD is played)

THE COURT: Not very realistic, is it?

(Indicating to photo.)

MR. P. BAKER: I can take the fig leaves off.

Just a Post-it note, examining areas of the body.

THE COURT: How about going to the beginning?

MR. P. BAKER: You want to see the original?

THE COURT: No. I want to see the credits.

No; I mean the first page, cover page.

MR. BLASIER: Go to help.

THE COURT: You don't have a first page?

There it is. There we go.

On the right side, Judge.

THE COURT: What's the next page?

There's no authorship to this thing.

Go up to help and about --

There we go.

MR. PETROCELLI: Stop it right there.

It says it's not warranted to be medically correct.

MR. BAKER: Oh, no.

MR. BLASIER: We can't back it up; we have to start it again.

THE COURT: All right.

MR. P. BAKER: You want me to run it again, Judge?

THE COURT: Yeah.

MR. BAKER: Anatomically correct.

MR. MEDVENE: It says, "This product not warranted to be medically
accurate."

MR. GELBLUM: For general --

MR. MEDVENE: Purposes.

MR. BLASIER: Dr. Spitz can say if the stomach is in the wrong place;
it's not rocket science. Dr. Spitz has done 60,000 autopsies. He
should know when it's anatomically incorrect.

(Pause in proceedings.)

THE COURT: What portions do you intend to use.

MR. BLASIER: Pictures of the abdominal area.

THE COURT: Show me the exhibits.

MR. BAKER: Drop it down. (Indicating to computer.)

MR. BAKER: That's one. To the side.

THE COURT: Okay.

What's next?

MR. BAKER: Side view.

Now, there we go.

That's it. (indicating to screen.

THE COURT: Any other view?

MR. BAKER: I don't think so.

THE COURT: Okay. I'll allow it.

(Jurors resume their respective seats.)

(The following proceedings were held in open court, in the presence of
the jury.)

THE COURT: Morning.

JURORS: Good morning, Your Honor.

THE COURT: You may proceed.

MR. MEDVENE: Thank you, Your Honor.

Dr. Werner Spitz.

WERNER SPITZ, called as a witness on behalf of Plaintiffs, was duly
sworn and testified as follows:

THE CLERK: You do solemnly swear that the testimony you may give in
the cause now pending before this court shall be the truth, the whole
truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

THE WITNESS: I do.

THE CLERK: And, sir, if you'd please state and spell your name for the
record.

THE WITNESS: Werner Spitz, S-P-I-T-Z.

THE CLERK: Werner is W-E-R-N-E-R?

THE WITNESS: Yes, ma'am.

THE CLERK: Thank you.

DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. MEDVENE:

Q. Good morning, sir.

A. Good morning.

Q. What's your profession?

A. I'm a medical doctor and I'm a pathologist and forensic
pathologist.

Q. What is a pathologist?

A. A pathologist is a physician who has done a residency in the
subject of pathology and specialized in the field where tissues and
body fluids are examined for the purpose of diagnosis.

And if a person should die in a hospital, such a pathologist may do an
autopsy on such an individual at the request of the family.

Q. And what is a forensic pathologist?

A. A forensic pathologist is a -- or a forensic pathologist's
sub-specialty of pathology, where specialization is in the area of
death and death from injury or suspected injury, and interpretation of
wounds in general.

Q. What is your educational background that qualifies you to be a
forensic pathologist?

A. I graduated from medical school in 1953; I did an internship and a
residency in pathology of five years.

I then did another residency in forensic pathology. I took the
American Board of Pathology Examinations in 1961 in New York, in
pathology and hospital pathology, and in '64 or '65 in forensic
pathology, in Washington.

And I worked in forensic pathology following my residency in Maryland,
at the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in Baltimore. I worked
there for two years.

I then went to West Berlin in Germany and worked at the Department of
Legal Medicine which is the same as the coroner's office or medical
examiner's office, in West Berlin for two years and three months.

And then I came back to Baltimore and was an assistant medical
examiner at the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner for Maryland for
several years.

I then was promoted to be the deputy chief medical examiner for that
office. During that time, I was appointed as assistant -- Associate
Professor of Pathology and Forensic Pathology at Johns Hopkins
University and at the University of Maryland, within the department of
pathology.

I left Maryland for Detroit, Michigan in 1972, to assume the position
of chief medical examiner for the County of Wayne, which is a Detroit
suburb, and held that position until 1988, in October.

During this time and to the present time, I'm Professor of Pathology
at Wayne State University School of Medicine.. And I'm a professor of
chemistry in the Windsor -- in Windsor, Ontario, Canada, which is
across from Detroit, where I teach forensic toxicology to students at
the department of chemistry.

When I came to Michigan, I also served and still serve as pathologist
for the County of Macomb, which is north of Detroit.

And as of 1988, I'm also pathologist for the County of Monroe, which
is south of DetroitN.

Q. You had mentioned, Dr. Spitz, that I believe you were board
certified in particular areas?

A. Yes; I'm BOARD certified in anatomic pathology and in forensic
pathology, by the American Board of Pathology.

Q. What does it mean to be board certified?

A. Board certified means to have undergone a period of training under
supervision in an accredited institution, such as one that would be
accredited for such training by the American Board of Pathology and
the accreditation committee of the American Medical Association in
Pathology that is five years in forensic pathology. That's an
additional year.

Q. Have you written various publications dealing with the subject of
forensic pathology?

A. Yes. I've written and published 90 scientific papers which were
published in medical journals, and I have published a textbook in
forensic pathology, which I edited and authored in large part, which
was published originally in 19 -- in 1972, and has since been
republished in an expanded version in 1980, and again in 1993.

Q. And the title?

A. The title is Medicolegal: An Investigation of Death.

Q. And did you both edit and write chapters in that book?

A. I'm the editor of the book. And I have written approximately, I
would say, 60 or 65 percent of it.

Q. And did you write any chapters in that book that deal with trauma?

A. I think most of the chapter dealing with trauma, I wrote, which
means gunshot wounds, and stab wounds, and shotgun wounds, and
asphyxiation, and child abuse, and traffic accidents, and drowning,
and maybe some others.

Q. And where, to your knowledge is that textbook used?

A. That book is used worldwide. It's the largest English book on the
market right now. It's used worldwide; it's used extensively in -- in
medical schools, in law schools, and by police academies, by lawyers
who deal with this kind of work.

Q. Are you currently spending any portion of your time writing or
editing various books or articles in the area of forensic pathology
and injury?

MR. BAKER: Objection. Relevance. Stipulate to qualifications.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: I'm in the process of collecting material for a fourth
edition. It takes about three years to do this. And the book should
really be updated every seven, eight years.

Q. You licensed to practice medicine in various states?

A. Yes, I'm licensed to practice medicine in Maryland, Virginia, the
District of Columbia, Michigan, of course, and all the common market
countries in Europe.

Q. Have you been appointed to any United States governmental
commissions that were involved in the investigation of death?

A. Yes; I was appointed years ago to a committee that was put together
by Vice-President Nelson Rockefeller, investigating the assassination
of President Kennedy.

Three years later, I was again appointed to the committee of the House
of Representatives investigating the assassination of President
Kennedy and Martin Luther King.

Q. Among your duties as a forensic pathologist, do you, on a regular
basis, determine the manner and cause of violent death?

A. Yes, I do.

Q. Do you frequently make such determination in cases where you have
not performed the autopsy?

A. Yes, I do.

Q. Can examinations of the cause of death and circumstances
surrounding the cause of death be done months and years after the
death occurred?

A. Yes, it can.

Q. And how is that done?

A. Well, it -- it is based on material that is generated at the time,
and -- unless, of course, there is a re-examination of the body -- but
mostly -- by far, mostly it is done on materials, such as an autopsy
report or results of various analyses that were generated at the time
of the incident in question, and that can be examined at any time.

Q. That generally include pictures?

A. Photographs, autopsy reports, results of various analyses.

Q. Is it customary in your field of work for one forensic pathologist,
on the basis of autopsy reports and pictures, to review the work of
another forensic pathologist or an individual who performed the
autopsy?

A. That is very common, yes. These materials that are generated are
really largely generated for the purpose of enabling to provide a
permanent record, for whatever purpose, which includes review by
others.

Q. In the course of your career, approximately how many autopsies have
you performed?

A. Many thousand. I wouldn't be -- I couldn't tell you. But many
thousand.

Q. Have you also --

A. I've been in the work for 43 years.

Q. Have you also supervised thousands of autopsies?

A. Yes, I have. Because back in Maryland, I was in charge of the
training program, which means that pathologists came to do a residency
and were trained for the purpose of becoming forensic pathologists.

Of course, when I was chief medical examiner, as chief medical
examiner, I would supervise the residents and teach -- teach them and
prepare them for the board examination.

Q. Do you still do autopsies yourself?

A. Yes, I do.

Q. Approximately how many a year?

A. I do between 300 and 350 autopsies a year at the present time.

Q. Are you presently called upon as a consultant to review the
findings of others in the field of medical examination relating to
death?

A. Yes, I am.

Q. Are you called by plaintiffs' attorneys, prosecutors, as well as
defense counsel, to see if you will consult with them?

A. Yes. I get called by attorneys representing both sides in civil
cases, that is, plaintiff and defendant, and in criminal cases, both
defendant and prosecution. Q. On occasion, in connection with your
consulting work, are you required to testify in court?

A. Occasionally. Mostly -- many times I evaluate a case and will
testify in court. Many times I get consulted and will not testify in
court. Maybe because I don't have the same opinion as the referring
party and maybe for some other reasons, which I don't know.

Q. Other than your official duties that you told us about for the
Counties of Macomb and Monroe, can you estimate approximately what
percentage of your time, when you do testify, is on behalf of the
plaintiff and/or the defendant?

A. You mean in all cases put together, criminal and civil?

Q. Yes. Other than your work for the Counties of Macomb and Monroe.

A. I would say that probably somewhat more in favor of the defense in
criminal cases. In civil cases, maybe the same.

Q. In your experience, do you always give an opinion that sides with
the side that hired you?

MR. BAKER: I'm going to object. That's leading and suggestive.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: No. Many -- many times what transpires is, I get a phone
call, then subsequently I get a file, and I review the file. Then I
call up with my opinion, or I write an opinion letter; and many times,
I don't hear again.

Other times, I am called back or a letter comes back, "thank you very
much," and they pay my fee who -- for whatever I generated and I never
hear from them again after that. And other times I may hear from them
and have to come to court and testify or give a deposition.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Have you testified many times in court as an
expert?

A. Yes, I have.

Q. And the majority of those times, did you personally do the autopsy?

A. No.

Q. And incidentally, were you present when the autopsy was done in
this case?

A. No, I was not.

Q. Can you tell us, in terms of your time you spend on business now,
in your work as a doctor, what percentage of your time is spent in the
area of academics, what percentage of your time is spent doing
autopsies, and what percentage being a consultant in matters involving
violent death?

A. As a crude approximation, I would say it might be safe to divide
this as a third -- a third.

Q. When you're called as a consultant by one side or another, do you
have a customary charge or fee?

A. Yes, I do.

Q. And how much do you charge an hour?

A. I charge $300 an hour for office work.

Q. And is that your charge in this case?

A. Yes.

Q. And you also charge a fee when you travel out of town and go to
court?

A. Yes, I do.

Q. When were you initially hired or retained, approximately, in this
matter?

A. Sometime early this year. I think it was January of 1996.

Q. And did you review certain material?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Could you tell us what material you have reviewed in connection
with giving the opinions that you intend to offer this morning?

A. I have reviewed the coroner's book, the coroner's documents
generated, to include the coroner's investigation, autopsy reports,
autopsy pictures, scene pictures. I've gone to the scene myself. I've
reviewed the police reports. I've reviewed various diagrams that
accompany the autopsy reports. I may have reviewed other things. I
don't remember.

Q. You review testimony of individuals?

A. Various testimony, yes. I've reviewed various previous court trial
testimony.

Q. All right. Let's go to this specific case now, if we can, Dr.
Spitz.

Based on your review of the material, do you have an opinion as to the
cause of death of Nicole Brown?

A. Yes, I do.

Q. And what is that opinion?

A. Nicole Brown died as a result of blood loss.

Q. Blood loss coming from where?

A. Coming from a large wound of the neck, severing the carotid
arteries and other vessels.

Q. Could you describe for us the nature of her injuries?

If you can, group them.

A. Nicole Brown had some superficial injuries of the hands. She had an
injury to the top of her head. She had four stab wounds, ranging from
approximately an inch or an inch and a quarter in diameter, because
it's a gaping wound, to one that is maybe estimated at an eighth of an
inch. Then two others of intermediate size, entering, but not --
entering the skin and tissues underneath, but not causing any major
damage.

And then a slash across the neck running from left to right, which is
a devastating slash, causing severage of the carotid arteries and
other vessels, cutting through the voice box, separating a part of the
voice box. In other words, cutting the voice box in two and entering
the -- the -- the bone of the -- the vertebral column. Going through
-- of course, on the way, it would have had to go through the tube
through which we swallow, the so-called esophagus.

MR. MEDVENE: May I approach, Your Honor, with your permission, to get
a board?

THE COURT: Go ahead.

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, may I move over there to see what he's talking
about during the examination?

MR. MEDVENE: I apologize, ladies and gentlemen, for the pictures.

Approach the witness, Your Honor?

THE COURT: You may.

(BY MR. MEDVENE) Dr. Spitz, I'm going to ask you certain questions
about a board that we put up for the jury. It's titled now "Defensive
Wound to Ms. Brown." It's No. 375.

(The instrument herein referred to as A board entitled "Blunt Force
Trauma and Defensive Wounds to Ms. Brown," was marked for
identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 375.)

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) So if you look AT 375, it has all the photos in
it, including ones that are on or not on the board?

A. Yes.

Q. And if --

MR. BAKER: Counsel, may I just --

(Pause for defense and plaintiff's counsel to converse sotto voce.)

(Plaintiffs' counsel approaches witness.)

(Plaintiffs' counsel and witness converse sotto voce.)

THE WITNESS: I'm fully aware of that.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) I think the best way to do this, Dr. Spitz, is,
could you first tell me from the exhibits in front of you that are
375, what they show in general in terms of blunt-force trauma or
defensive wounds?

And then I'm going to ask you, with the Court's permission, just to
come up to the board, because I'm not going to place them on the TV
screen.

If you could, just demonstrate to the jury what these photos show.
Would that be all right?

A. Yes.

Q. All right.

A. So if I just go through the injuries depicted in -- and describe
them.

I might say that there is a scraping, in a crude way of saying,
approximately the size of quarter coin on the back of the left
shoulder in it -- the level of the shoulder blade. And it's a
scraping, which means that it's not a blow, not a cut. It's a rubbing,
where the upper layer of the skin has been rubbed off and it dried and
it appears brown.

Then, of course, then there are -- then there is a scraping on the
back of the neck, also, in a -- occurring in a similar way. Then there
are some scrapings on the back of the right shoulder and over the
right shoulder blade, not very large. Not very impressive.

Then there are rubbings up against a cement or stucco wall or floor or
ground. There is a scraping on the back of the right elbow, all again
of similar size, also from rubbing against a floor, cement floor or a
stucco wall or -- or some kind of object that had that kind of
structure.

Q. Are these photos that you're looking at, but that are not on the
board?

A. They're not on the board.

Q. When we get to the ones on the board, if you could, if you wouldn't
mind, with the Court's permission, coming down and just pointing out,
when you discuss the photos that are on the board.

(Witness approaches large board.)

A. On the back of the left hand and over the knuckle of the ring
finger -- I'm sorry.

Yes. On the back of the left hand, over the knuckle of the left ring
finger, there's a scraping. And there's a small scraping on the back
of the ring finger in the level of where normally we'd wear a ring.
And it may be an eighth of an inch or so.

Then it looks like it's circular. Then on the back of the middle
finger, approximately a quarter of an inch forward of the joint -- of
the joint -- of the furthest joint on my hand, that would be about
(indicating to his own finger), about here, is a linear mark not --
not a scraping, but it looks like it's a somewhat deeper, little,
superficial tear of the skin.

The next picture.

Q. Excuse me. The next one is 2002 -- I'm sorry.

A. I might just tell you about the following picture, too.

Q. The following picture is 2023.

A. These two pictures show only that there are no injuries. These are
just the palm of the hand and the fingers, showing no damage.

Q. Next, sir, I'm going to ask you about -- and you can wait here, if
you want. (Counsel displays a new photo board.)

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) This is a little rough, I'm sorry -- "Entitled
Sharp Force Injuries and Blunt-Force Trauma To Head Face and Neck of
Ms. Brown."

Dr. Spitz, I'm going to ask you some questions about sharp force
injuries. And I hand you a number of pictures that include Exhibits
2019, 2018, 2017, 2016, 2014 -- excuse me -- 2016, 2024, 2014 and
2010.

And I have on the board what's been marked 2013, the picture to the
left. And that's 2015 and 2013, which is the picture to the right of
Ms. Brown and showing her neck.

Could you tell the ladies and gentlemen of the jury and the Court
about the sharp force injuries and blunt-force trauma that you
observed both with respect to the pictures on the board and the
pictures not on the board.

A. If I may go through the pictures not on the board first.

Q. Yes, that's fine.

MR. MEDVENE: May I have the witness stand here. Would that be okay?

THE COURT: Yes.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Turn around, if you don't mind. Don't display the
pictures.

On the top of the head, somewhat to the right --

A. To the right is a stab wound, and it's got a little extension, a
superficial extension running from it. It is a stab wound that I know
from the report -- the picture doesn't obviously show that -- that it
does not enter the -- it does not go through the skull. It goes to the
skull, but it doesn't go through the skull, and there's no injury into
the brain underneath.

There is another wound in the head, somewhat more to the back, also a
stab wound, also a wound that does not go into the bone. It just goes
into the skin -- to the skin in the scalp and through the scalp, but
not into the bone. It does not penetrate.

And subsequently there are -- there is another one, a relatively small
-- it is, I would say, -- maybe it's less than half an inch long, and
it is superficial. And it, again, didn't go into the bone. It just
involves the scalp. It is behind the left ear, somewhere behind the --
I'm sorry -- behind the right ear, somewhere where my finger is
showing.

Q. May the record show that Dr. Spitz is pointing his finger at
approximately 5 o'clock on the back side of his head.

A. On the -- I think it is the right side of the head, somewhat up
above ear level, there's a bruise. And the bruise is, I would say,
maybe an inch, maybe a little more than an inch in diameter.

And I think it's -- I think -- I say -- I think because the picture is
so close, that it's difficult to know exactly, but I think it's
somewhere up here on the scalp, there's a bruise.

(Witness indicates to head.)

And a bruise means -- a bruise -- people -- some people call it a
contusion, some call a black-and-blue mark.

Q. Let the record show Dr.` Spitz was showing the area at the top of
his head, about 3 o'clock.

A. There is -- in the next picture, there is a piece of -- a portion
of brain tissue. And this is a portion of brain tissue that was
obviously taken from the brain, and it shows bruising. It shows a
black-and-blue mark, if you will, in the brain, in the surface of the
brain.

And I am not sure whether it is from under the bruise that I just
described in the scalp, or whether it is from an opposite area.

The reason I'm saying this is because the brain in the skull is like
jello in a cup. And when you rattle it very sharply, the brain
strikes; or when you inflict a blow to it, the brain moves and strikes
the skull under the blow, and then it moves opposite and strikes the
inside of the skull on the opposite side.

So I don't -- either way, it would get a bruise. So I don't know
whether it's from under the bruise that is in the scalp. In other
words, from the bruise that was caused by a blow, or whether it is a
bruise of the brain from the opposite side, when the jello, or the
brains, went and hit the inside of the skull.

Q. On the right side -- I'm sorry. On the left side of the neck, below
the left --

MR. BAKER: I'm sorry, Doctor; could you identify, please, the number
of the photo you're looking at when you're making these descriptions.

THE WITNESS: I don't know the numbers.

MR. MEDVENE: This photo was on the board. It's 206.

MR. BAKER: I don't want to interrupt you, Doctor.

MR. MEDVENE: On the -- okay. It's 2015.

MR. BAKER: Thanks so much.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Okay.

A. This picture, 2015.

Q. The one next to it is 2013.

A. Okay.

2015 shows four stab wounds arranged in a vertical orientation,
meaning one IS closer to the ear, one below that one, below that one,
and one on the bottom.

They are in a vertical line, up-and-down line. Bottom part is the one
that I described earlier, which I said is approximately an inch to an
inch and a quarter and it's gaping. That's why, because it's gaping.
It is -- it is wide open and it looks round, but it is a stab wound.

Then above it is a smaller one, and then above that one is a tiny one,
which is maybe an eighth of an inch, and would correspond to the tip
of a blade.

And above that one is the fourth stab wound, which is approximately, I
would say, an inch and a half below the ear.

The picture also shows a vast gaping wound, deep wound on the -- as a
continuation of a horizontal superficial cut, which goes from the
level of the ear on the neck towards the right, and towards the right
end in a vast cut that involves primarily the right side of the neck.
And it starts -- the big cut starts right here; and the horizontal
superficial cut starts in the level of the ear.

Q. Can you tell, Dr.` Spitz, from the photographs when you have a
weapon, whether the assailant was in front of or behind Ms. Brown when
he slashed her throat?

A. The assailant was in back; and the slash runs from left to right.

Q. Could you -- with the Court's permission, could you just
demonstrate on me quickly how that would happen.

(Witness demonstrates on Mr. Medvene.)

MR. MEDVENE: May the record show that Dr. Spitz' left hand is across
my chin and his right hand is to the left of my neck, looking forward.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) And the wound would be delivered how?

A. The wound would be delivered, superficial deep --

MR. BAKER: Let the record reflect that his elbow is about at the left
jaw of Mr. Medvene, and that his left hand extended beyond Mr.
Medvene's face for a distance of approximately five inches.

Doctor -- correct, Doctor?

THE WITNESS: I didn't --

MR. BAKER: I was describing where your left hand was in holding Mr.
Medvene.

THE WITNESS: My left hand is somewhere on the face. I didn't
particularly concentrate.

MR. BAKER: Describe where you put it, sir.

THE WITNESS: I put it -- I put it roughly across the middle of the
face.

MR. BAKER: Thank you, sir.

The next picture, I believe, is 2013, you said?

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) 2013.

A. 1013 (sic) shows the gaping edge of the same wound that I just
described, the gaping portion of the wound that I just described,
which starts roughly in the level of the left angle of the mouth, and
then goes all the way to just below the right ear, which is not shown
on this picture, but is shown on another picture.

That the wound -- this gaping wound runs upward to the right and ends
in the level of just half an inch below the right ear.

The picture further shows an area which looks like it may be a -- may
be bruised on the left side of the mouth, the outside, the lips, here.

And below that, looks like there may be a bruise -- a bruise,
black-and-blue mark in this area. About -- together, but somewhat
bigger than a silver dollar. There are --

Q. Any other photos you haven't described?

A. Yes. There is a photo that I did not describe that I mentioned, but
I didn't -- it's not displayed -- is the photo that ends -- that shows
this gaping wound, ending just below the right ear.

(Witness resumes seat.)

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Dr.` Spitz, how soon, in your opinion, after the
encounter with the assailant began, was Ms. Brown's throat slashed?

MR. BAKER: I object to the vague, ambiguous -- I mean, is he -- is the
question asking from the first wound until the wound of the throat
being slashed, or is he asking for the first encounter with the
assailant until --

THE COURT: Clarify your question, please.

MR. MEDVENE: Yes, Your Honor.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Dr. Spitz, from the first mark or wound on Ms.
Brown, to the slashing of the throat, do you have any -- do you have
an opinion on how long it took before the assailant slashed her
throat?

A. I think the slashing of the throat was the terminal event, and I
think the entire scenario of Ms. Brown's altercation, from the first
wound to the last, was less than 15 seconds.

Q. And what do you -- what do you base that on?

A. On the nature and number of the injuries, and on the recognition
that it takes seconds to inflict four stab wounds, or even less than
seconds; and it takes a very brief time, indeed, again, seconds or a
second, perhaps, to slash the throat.

I mean, how long does it take to make a -- wielding a knife and
cutting into flesh, regardless of the depth? If the knife is sharp, it
will just penetrate.

Q. And how about whatever stab wounds there are on the neck; how long
does that take?

A. Seconds.

Q. Show me, please.

A. I will stand up here, then. The height is maybe a bit better.

(Witness demonstrates.)

Q. From your examination, do you have an opinion which way the blood
would flow from the neck when Ms. Brown's throat was slashed?

A. In order to tell you which way the blood would flow, I would have
to tell you that she was bent forward. She was -- may I use you again?

(Counsel and witness demonstrate.)

A. (Continuing.) She was bent forward, and this was done in this way.

She was bent further downward, and the blood then would run downward,
would run downward. Some of it would run forward, but most of the
blood would run to the ground.

Thank you.

Q. Would the blood, in your opinion, be in large quantity on the
assailant?

A. No, on the assailant, there would be very little blood, because as
the blood vessels that contain the blood are cut, the -- would you
come back?

(Witness and counsel demonstrate.)

A. (Continued.) As this occurs, that -- the cutting occurs, the cut
occurs very rapidly. The hand holding the blade moves away from the
source of the bleeding, so the body of the victim shields the
assailant, and the bleeding occurs after the hand has moved away.

If the left arm that's holding is above the injury, as it would have
to be, the bleeding is forward and downward and not upward.

Q. Where's the blood coming from?

A. The blood is coming from the two carotid arteries, which are each
the diameter of your little finger, which is very big for an artery,
and from branches of the carotid artery, and to a significant lesser
extent, from severed veins.

Q. Is it coming under pressure or --

A. The arterial pressure is such that if you cut an artery, you would
have blood and you let it bleed openly, it's a pulsating hemorrhage
that would go up to a 12-foot ceiling.

THE COURT: Okay. The Court will take a ten-minute recess.

Don't talk about the case. Don't form or express any opinion.

THE WITNESS: Yes, Your Honor.

(Recess.) (Jurors resume their respective seats.)

(The following proceedings were held in open court, in the presence of
the jury.)

THE COURT: Okay. The audience, first row by the jury box, there's a
complaint that the jurors are able to hear your comments that you're
making. And if you continue to talk and peer around that barrier, I'm
going to clear that first row.

You may proceed.

DIRECT EXAMINATION (Continued) BY MR. MEDVENE:

Q. Dr. Spitz, when we concluded, you made a reference to the arteries
and blood spurting from arteries.

Were you making a specific reference to this case or arteries in
general?

A. No, I was answering your question about pressure in the arteries.
And this is -- this was a general statement about how much pressure
there is in an artery, as opposed to some other blood vessels which
don't have this kind of pressure.

This is not applicable to this case at all. In other words, yes, there
is a lot of pressure in this case, but it didn't go to any ceiling.
There was no ceiling in this case.

Q. Now, in this case, in your opinion, from what you've seen and
viewed, where did the blood go?

A. She was -- maybe you can help me.

She was bent forward; I think she was (demonstrating). She was even
closer, I think, a foot above the ground, because the blood comes out,
gushes out under great pressure. There is no blood in the vast area
around; there is blood down below, running down from the bottom step,
down on the ground.

This is where the blood went. The blood shot downward because she was
down like so, and she was down like so. That's how the blood the got
there. Otherwise, the blood would have been all over the place.

Q. And her head was pulled out?

A. And her head was pulled back.

Q. How?

A. (Witness demonstrates.)

MR. BAKER: With the left hand underneath his nose?

THE WITNESS: Either that way or by the hair.

Somehow, the neck was taut; otherwise, you wouldn't get this kind of a
gaping wound.

Q. Okay. Thank you.

(Witness assists Mr. Medvene to stand up.)

Q. Let's move, if we might, to Mr. Goldman.

Based on your review of the -- of the material you previously
described, do you have an opinion as to the cause of death of Mr.
Goldman?

A. Mr. Goldman died as a result of blood loss. The cause of death is
the same in Mr. Goldman as it was in Nicole Brown.

Q. You say the cause of death is the same. What do you mean by that?

A. Blood loss.

Q. Could you describe for us his injuries and put them in groups, if
you could.

A. Ron -- Ron Goldman has injuries that can be grouped into four
categories. He had superficial wounds, superficial injuries,
superficial cuts and bruises, and various defensive-type wounds in
various parts of the body, including a cut on the left -- on the front
of the left thigh.

I know it looks wide and gaping.

This was also not a very devastating wound, because the there are no
major blood vessels in the thigh. There is skin and fat and muscle,
and they bleed, but they don't bleed very, very heavily, not anywhere
near what some of the other areas of the body bleed.

Then there is a set of wounds in the neck area, and one of them is a
stab wound that enters into the internal carotid or -- internal
jugular vein.

Thirdly, there is there are two wounds in the right side of the chest
with a penetrate into the -- through the chest wall into the chest
cavity and into the lung.

Lastly, there is a wound in the left flank, (witness indicates) here,
somewhere like in this area, 45 inches above the heels in this area,
(indicating) in the back side of the flank.

Q. Left side above your belt, approximately five inches?

A. Well, I wear my pants -- down in where like I'm showing.

Q. Yes, sir.

A. It's a short way above the hip bone in the back.

Q. Yes.

A. That's the last wound.

This wound is not very large in the skin, but it is the devastating
wound that caused the death before any of the other wounds. Even
though some of them may have been fatal or would have been fatal, this
wound would have killed Ronald Goldman in short order.

When I mention these wounds, I would like to emphasize that my listing
of these injuries does not correspond to the order in with a they were
inflicted.

Q. Were there wounds on both sides of the body?

A. There were wounds on both sides of the body. The wound that I named
the devastating wound on the left flank on the left side of the body,
and then there were the stab wounds to the lung on the right side of
the body. And there are wounds on both sides.

Q. What accounts for wounds on both sides of the body?

A. Well, there's movement. There is movement. There is an attempt to
get away from this situation. Sometimes the victim presents the right
side and sometimes presents the left side. And there's movement on the
part of the assailant, as well, but very fast movement.

Q. You said that you weren't putting the wounds in any sequence when
you listed the groups.

Do you have any opinion on the nature of the struggle, in some general
sense, when the thigh wound was inflicted and the wound to the aorta
or the left flank was inflicted?

A. The wound of the thigh and many of the superficial, or maybe most
of the superficial cuts and bruises were inflicted at the outset.

In other words, that's how it started. That's during the active
portion of the altercation -- of the -- of the encounter.

The wound to the left flank, I cannot say exactly when it happened,
but it occurred early on. And the reason I'm saying that is because
this wound entered through the skin, through a muscle adjacent to the
vertebral column, and into the aorta.

The aorta is a garden-hose-diameter pipe, tube. The aorta comes
directly out of the heart, makes a curve called the arch, runs to the
left of the vertebral column, and then comes down into the lower
abdominal area and bifurcates into each leg.

Q. When you use the words vertebral column --

A. The vertebral column is the backbone.

And within the aorta, with a is the large-caliber artery, there's very
large pressure, so that when there's a hole in the aorta, the blood
gushes out at fantastic speed.

And so, there are two holes in the aorta. There is one that is
described in the report as half an inch, and then the knife went
through the aorta a second time as it came out of the aorta, and
caused another half-an-inch opening.

I measured it on a picture and I found that it is indeed five-eighths
of an inch, but it's as close as half an inch as can be.

And the reason I'm saying that this wound was inflicted early on, is
because there is very little blood in the chest from two wounds that
injure the lung.

And the reason that there is so little blood in the chest is because
the blood had already been running out of the aorta, however little
time there was.

But as soon as there is a hole in the aorta, the pressure drops, just
as -- exactly the same as would happen if you make two half-an-inch or
two five-eighths-inch holes in your garden hose, you could not expect
that the sprinkler at the end of the garden hose is going to generate
a lot of water, because the water is running out before it gets to the
sprinkler.

Q. We'll talk about the aorta a little more in a moment.

But you mentioned a lot of blood coming out. Is that blood going out
externally or is it internal, within the body?

A. No. Most -- most of Mr. Goldman's blood was internal bleeding. And
the bleeding, in the case of Mr. Goldman, was from the aorta; all
other wounds combined caused little bleeding. But the bleeding from
the aorta was overwhelming, and is, in fact, is what killed him. And
this wound was bled internally.

Q. We'll talk more about it in a moment.

Let me go on to talk first in terms of the struggle about blunt-force
trauma, and put on the board Exhibit 383.

And if you would, look at all the pictures, please.

A. (Witness complies.)

MR. MEDVENE: Excuse me; I'm not going to put a board up.

I wonder if you can look at exhibits 1991, 93, -- excuse me -- 1991,
1993, 384, 1995, 1998, 1992, 1994, 385, 1996, and 1997 that I place
before you, and just generally describe the nature of what those
pictures depict. But we can do it in a general way?

A. Mr. Goldman had, I believe, two stab wounds in the head. Again,
small; again, penetrated through the scalp -- through the skin, the
scalp, but did not go into the bone or through the bone.

I do not have the same numbers that you have indicated.

(The instrument herein referred to as a document with six photographs,
collectively was marked for identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No.
383.)

(Counsel approaches witness stand.)

A. (Continuing.) Then, there is -- there are some cuts and bruises and
scrapings. There is a scraping and a bruise in the area of the left
lower chest. Maybe -- in fact, there are two there.

It's a superficial scraping, where you can see that the uppermost
layer of the skin, called the epidermis, is rubbed off.

The epidermis is what a snake has. We are covered with a very thin
membrane called the epidermis, and a snake is covered with this; and
once a year, it sheds this. And we don't shed it, but we're covered
with it, and it prevents -- its function is to prevent fluid loss. And
if it's rubbed off, then there will be some fluid loss.

But if the death follows in rapid succession, very quickly, then there
is no fluid loss, but there's drying of the area, and it becomes
brown. That's why these scrapings appear brown on the picture.

It's the same thing as what you sustain when you fall and scuff your
knee, and there is this little, white tissue membrane that you will
rip off and throw away. This is called a scraping. And then with time,
of course, if you are alive, then that will ooze and make a scab. In a
dead person, it will just dry and become brown.

So having said this, there is a scraping like this on the back of Mr.
Goldman on the left side. There are two like that, actually, and
they're not very large; they're a bit larger -- one them is a little
larger than a silver dollar; then there is one that is quite small;
then there is another one, a little bit higher, also not very large.
And that's a superficial scraping on the left side of the back,
roughly in the level of the elbow, so about where my finger is showing
(indicating.)

Q. Beyond the -- on the left of the back, looking --

A. On the left.

Q. -- looking forward, about 9 o'clock?

A. Yes.

Then, there are scrapings on the left wrist and hand over the fingers.
And over the left wrist, there is evidence that the epidermis is just
the same as what you have on the knee when you fall.

The epidermis, as seen on the picture, IS hanging from one end, and
that is due to grabbing and moving at the same time and pushing the
epidermis up from the skin. And the epidermis, the upper layer of the
skin, is still hanging on. And you can see it depicted on the picture.

There are some other scrapes on the wrist, in total, about two; and
then one looks like it could be a fingernail mark, and on the back of
the fingers, from grabbing and from holding and moving at the same
time. So it would be severe moving, causing the upper layer of the
skin to be scuffed off.

On the area between the right index finger and middle finger, there's
a cut. And it's fairly large cut; I would say it is a little less than
an inch, and it's a obviously a penetrating injury. And the fingers
are spread like I'm showing, and you can see the cut.

There is on the front -- on the front, I mean this area that I'm
showing -- the palm side of the right hand, on the index finger, in
the -- just below or at the level of the first joint, there is what
could be a fingernail mark, and what is possibly a fingernail mark on
Ron Goldman's right index finger.

Q. Let me -- you have one more?

A. On the left hand, first on the thumb, there is a scraping, again,
with some loose epidermis.

On the web of the thumb, there is a cut, and on the side of the palm,
in extension of the little finger, where my right finger is, showing
on the left palm there is a semicircular cut.

All the cuts in here are defensive wounds. "Defensive wound" means
that the hand was used to ward off a blade that was coming towards
him.

Q. Let's move -- let's move, if we can, to what we've marked as a
board -- as 382.

I want you to look at two photos and describe them. One is 2001 and
one is 2002.

Could you tell the ladies and gentlemen of the jury and the Court,
what that indicates in terms of blows or what happened to Mr. Goldman?

Do you have 2001 and 2002 before you?

A. I don't know with a ones those are.

(The instrument herein referred to as a document entitled "Sharp Force
Injuries and Blunt Force Trauma to Head of Mr. Goldman," was marked
for identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 382.)

(Counsel approaches witness stand.)

Q. Um-hum, um-hum; yes. Those two.

A. These are two superficial, small stab wounds in the head with a do
not penetrate. That means they don't go into the -- through the skull;
they just go into the skin, into the scalp.

Q. And I'm going to ask you now about certain sharp-force injuries,
and I'm going to put up a board. (Counsel displays board entitled
"Sharp Force Injuries, blunt-force trauma to Face, Neck, and Right
Shoulder of Mr. Goldman.)

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) You have certain photos in front of you, Dr.
Spitz. I wonder if you could -- this is Exhibit 378 -- if you might
take the photos you have in front of you that are part of 378, and
approach the board and describe for the jury the sharp-force injuries.

(The instrument herein referred to as A board containing six
photographs, collectively, was marked for identification as
Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 378.)

THE WITNESS: You are talking about the ones that are on the board?

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Yeah, the ones on the board and the others that
are part of that series.

A. The left lower picture.

Q. It's all right -- I think it's okay with the Court if you come up.

MR. PETROCELLI: Take the pointer, Doctor.

THE WITNESS: The left lower picture shows a large gaping cut, stab
wound, penetrating on the left side of the neck.

There is another stab wound -- also a stab wound, and they come
together, see, because of the movement of both parties.

When a stab wound is made, the opening is much larger, often, than the
knife -- of the blade itself, because as the stabbing occurs, the
victim moves away, the hand of the assailant follows, and there is
cutting, as well as stabbing.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) The doctor was speaking about Exhibit 2004.

A. That's the reason why these wounds look as large as they are. They
are stab wounds, but they are stab wounds with a cut with it.

And there are different superficial cuts around the -- or below and
behind the left ear, indicating an attempt to cut. Because of the
movement, the attempt was futile and ended up in a superficial cut.
Eventually, a stab did occur behind the ear and on the left side of
the neck.

Q. You're going now to exhibit 1999?

A. The Exhibit 99?

Q. 1999.

A. 1999 shows, again, the same stab wound as I've indicated on the
left side of the neck, but primarily it shows the front of the neck
with two horizontal superficial injuries that did not succeed in
penetrating as deep slashes because of the movement.

Q. Direct your attention now to Exhibit 2000.

A. Exhibit 2000 shows one of the superficial stab wounds of the skull
-- of the scalp in the area where the head is shaved, and a stab wound
of the left back of the neck behind -- I'm sorry -- right back of the
neck, behind or below, and behind the right ear and a cut of the ear
itself of the back portion of the ear.

The stab/cut, stab, stab/cut, because there is stabbing and movement
and cutting behind and below the right ear is associated with
superficial extensions on both sides.

"Superficial" means just involving the skin.

Q. If you'll remain there for a moment, Doctor, I'm going to put
another board up.

(Counsel displays board entitled Sharp-Force Injuries to Left Flank,
Left Thigh and Right Chest of Mr.` Goldman Blunt-Force Trauma.)

Q. This is board is entitled Sharp-force Injuries to Left Flank, Left
Thigh and Right Chest of Mr. Goldman Blunt-Force Trauma.

I direct your attention to that board, Doctor, which is Exhibit 386,
and ask if you would start with the picture to the left, which is
Exhibit 1988.

(The instrument herein referred to as Board entitled Sharp-Force
Injuries to Left Flank, Left Thigh and Right Chest of Mr. Goldman
Blunt-Force Trauma was marked for identification as Plaintiffs'
Exhibit No. 386.)

(The instrument herein referred to as a side view photograph of a
man's body was marked for identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No.
1988.)

THE WITNESS: This is Ron Goldman's flank area and lower chest area on
the left side. The picture is confusing.

Here, this is a table he is on. This is his arm. So you are seeing
this area (witness indicating to his own body.)

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Excuse me, Doctor. You said this is the table. He
saw -- he was pointing to what appeared to be --

A. This.

Q. -- metal from the right of the picture, over about four, five
inches, and then you were pointing to the flesh on the right of that?

A. Yes.

This is his armpit up here. This is his pubic area down here. This is
his left arm. And his left arm is next to the body, and the picture
actually shows this area (witness indicating to his own body). The
left arm shows all kinds of scrapes, superficial -- here you can see
pieces on the top one -- you can see pieces of epidermis hanging
loose.

These are all -- they all look like blunt injury. Here's a scraping,
like a linear scraping.

This is not a stab wound.

Here is a black-and-blue mark, a superficial bruise.

Q. That's to the right, about --

A. On the back of the hand.

Q. Yeah.

A. On the back of the left hand and over the back of the forearm -- I
say back of the forearm because normally this is the front of the body
and this is the back of the body -- this is the back of the hand; this
is the front of the hand. (Indicating.)

And the reason that this picture is important is because this is the
devastating stab wound. It is not very impressive; it's not a very big
stab wound; it is situated on the back of the left flank, and it is
just above -- here is the hip -- and it is just above, and it is about
(witness indicating to his own body) in this area.

Q. On the diagram, it's about a quarter of an inch, a half an inch
above the blue marker.

A. It is about, yeah, three-quarters of an inch above the blue marker,
the scale.

This is the stab wound that went into the aorta, the picture next and
below it.

Q. Excuse me. That's Exhibit 1990?

A. 1990 shows the cut in the front of the left thigh.

For orientation sake, here is the hand.

Q. You were pointing over to the upper right-hand corner?

A. Yes; the upper right-hand corner shows the -- some fingers, and
below it -- so, in other words, if I were Mr. Brown, [sic] the stab
wound would be about on my thigh, in the front, about where I'm
showing.

Q. You said Mr. Brown; you meant Mr. Goldman?

A. Mr. Goldman. (Witness indicates to his own body.)

And it's a gaping wound, but it doesn't bleed very much. You can see
the skin, the top layer; then the yellow underneath is fat; and then
the red in the depth is muscle. And the cut goes into the muscle, but
obviously not through the muscle. It's a slash more than a stab.

Q. What's 1990?

A. 1990 shows --

Q. Excuse me. That picture is 1987.

(The instrument herein referred to as a photograph of a man's body was
marked for identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 1987.)

A. 1987 shows the back of Mr. Goldman's body, undressed. The head is
shaved in the back because of the stab wound that was previously
discussed.

And there is the slash of the back of the right side of the neck,
which is seen there. And there is a scraping on the back of the left
shoulder, a small one, with a I think is a scraping from some wall,
the ground, or something.

And then there are two bruises over the middle of the back, of the
middle of the lower back, with a are two black-and-blue marks, each
about the size of a dime.

And because of the vertebral bodies having a little knob in the back,
this is an area that was hit against some flat object, like a wall or
the ground.

And then, more significantly is the exact location of the stab wound
that caused the death.

And that is a stab wound of the back of the left flank. And it is not
a very impressive wound, but this is the wound that went into the
aorta.

Q. All right. Direct your attention to 1989.

A. 1989 is a picture of the right side of Mr. Goldman, showing the
lower portion of the chest and the two stab wounds, 1 and 2.

Q. That's -- I'm sorry sir. That's at the top of the picture?

A. That's at the top of the picture. Of what number?

Q. 1989.

A. 1989.

Two stab wounds in the lower chest, roughly about where my hand is
showing (witness indicating to his own body); and these are the two
that went into the right lung.

The rest of this only shows some scrapings, superficial scrapings,
with a, as we discussed before, once they dried, they become brown,
brown and firm, and little bit like leather.

(The instrument herein referred to as an autopsy photograph of a man's
body with ruler was marked for identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit
No. 1989)

Q. Directing your attention to 1986.

A. 1986 shows Mr. Goldman dressed with shirt, blue jeans and shoes,
sneakers, and blood on the left pant leg from the slash with a I have
shown earlier.

Mr. Goldman was upright when this happened, as is evident by the
distribution of the blood.

Q. And the exhibit I showed you earlier, was that Exhibit 1990?

A. Yes. I was pointing to this. This is a slash and this is the
bleeding from it.

(Indicating.)

Q. Go to the picture on the far right; that's 1977. And can you tell
us what that is?

A. 1977 is -- shows the cut or the stab wound in the aorta. And the
aorta has been opened and is now not a tube, but flat, because it's
been cut open to show one of the cuts. There were two.

I measured it and found it to be five-eighths of an inch. The other
report describes it as half an inch, for what that's worth.

The aorta shows two little blood vessels down below the cut with a are
the origins of two arteries that come out of the aorta, because the
aorta gives rise to the entire blood system, the entire arterial
system in the body, and the blood vessels come out of the aorta and
they look just like that.

And what is significant is that the soft tissues, the fat and other
soft tissues behind the aorta, is totally infiltrated with blood.

(The instrument herein referred to as a photograph of flesh was marked
for identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 1977.)

Q. How do you know that?

A. Well, because this is all brown and -- or brownish-blue from blood.
The normal color of this is yellow.

Q. And this -- this photo was taken by the coroner's office?

A. This photograph was taken by the coroner's office. All these
photographs were taken by the coroner's office.

Q. You mentioned infiltrated. What was infiltrated?

A. Because of the cut in the aorta, the blood came out and spilled
into this whole area. The picture was meant to show the cut in the
aorta, but when the picture was photographed, the tissue around the
aorta shows the blood and filtration.

Q. You say this whole area. What do you mean "this whole area?" The
whole area that's depicted?

A. The whole area that is shown, yes, that is shown on the picture.

In fact, you can look through the cut and see the other side of the
aorta, and even see that's infiltrated.

MR. MEDVENE: Okay. Thank you, Doctor.

THE COURT: Ladies and gentlemen, we'll adjourn till 1:30.

SANTA MONICA, CALIFORNIA
FRIDAY, OCTOBER 8, 1996
1:35 P.M.

DEPARTMENT NO. WEQ
HON. HIROSHI FUJISAKI, JUDGE

(REGINA D. CHAVEZ, OFFICIAL REPORTER)

(Jurors resume their respective Seats.)

WERNER SPITZ, the witness on the stand at the time of the recess,
having been previously duly sworn, was examined and testified further
as follows:

THE COURT: You may proceed.

DIRECT EXAMINATION (CONTINUED) BY MR. MEDVENE:

Q. How long did the struggle take between Ron Goldman and the person
that killed him?

A. It is my opinion that this struggle took around a minute, give or
take.

Q. And what is the basis for your opinion that it took a minute, give
or take?

A. Primarily, the nature of the injuries, the injury in the left flank
was one that would have been incapacitating in very, very short time
because what it did -- What it caused is a near immediate fall of the
blood pressure, which means that because the blood oozes out from the
circulation in the body, from the blood circulation in the body, there
is not enough blood to reach the brain.

A person loses ability to stand up, loses ability to think, becomes
woozy and in very short order, becomes disabled.

The rest of the injuries, the superficial injuries in the fight, you
have to understand that many of these injuries occurred together in
one movement. There is a lot of movement in this kind of a situation.

And when the knife is wielded there and you use it to stab, there may
be a superficial injury in one place, the victim moves, and sustains a
second and a third injury by the same wielding of the knife.

So, yeah, there are a number of -- or a significant number of
superficial injuries and four or five other deep wounds. But as the
deep wound is inflicted, there is a scrape, a scraping of the tip of
the knife causing superficial cuts in other places, and then the
thrust, which penetrates.

So you have to understand that there is not a lapse of time between
wounds. It all goes in one context.

Q. Let me put on the board, a chart.

(Counsel displays cross-sectioned diagram of torso.)

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Would you, with the Court's permission, would like
to approach the chart and please tell me what the chart depicts?

A. May I approach, Your Honor.

THE COURT: You may.

MR. MEDVENE: Exhibit numbers 2025. You have it.

MR. GELBLUM: He has it.

(Indicating to pointer.)

MR. MEDVENE: Sorry.

MR. BAKER: Is there a question pending?

MR. MEDVENE: Yes. I asked what the chart depicts?

THE WITNESS: When we speak about the abdomen --

MR. BAKER: I'm going to move to strike as nonresponsive and ask the
Court have him answer the question.

THE COURT: Describe what the chart is.

THE WITNESS: I'm sorry.

THE COURT: Yes. Describe the chart.

THE WITNESS: The chart depicts or the chart shows a cut through the
middle of the body. The middle of the body in the area of the stab
wound in the left flank.

In other words, here is the tab wound of the left flank. This chart
shows the body cut through this area, and we are looking down on the
cut. And what it shows, is that the abdominal cavity, the abdomen, the
belly, is divided into two compartments.

The front compartment, which is shown in green, contains the liver,
the stomach, the small and large intestines, but not the kidneys and
not the adrenal glands and not the aorta. And not the vertebral
column. The vertebral column is behind --

Q. Where "L" is?

A. Where "L" is. "L" stands for lumbar because it's the lumbar level
of the vertebral column. This is a vertebral body. And there's muscle
on each side of the vertebral body.

And the stab wound goes through the muscle and into the aorta and
through the aorta.

It goes into the aorta, makes a half-inch cut and comes out of the
aorta, makes another half-inch cut.

Q. Does the tip --

A. And the tip of the blade, which already I said earlier in the
morning, that one of the wounds I believe in Ronald Brown (sic) --

Q. Ronald Goldman?

A. I'm sorry, Ron Goldman was made by the tip of the blade. So it is a
knife with a tip. The tip of the blade, just the tip pierces or enters
the sac, the membrane of the sac -- the wall of the sac that contains
the organs in the front compartment causing a small amount of injury,
causing a small amount of bleeding.

Q. Does that account --

A. That accounts for three ounces of blood in this large cavity which
contains the intestine and the liver and the large intestine.

Q. Does that cavity, as a general rule, have any blood in it?

A. Normally, there's no blood in there. Normally, there's no free
blood anywhere in the body.

Q. By free blood, we mean what?

A. Blood that is outside of blood vessels.

Q. Okay. Go ahead.

A. Except if there's an injury. When the aorta was injured, you can
see the aorta is in the white area, not in the abdominal cavity, in
the other compartment which contains the vertebral body, the kidneys,
and the aorta.

The aorta is situated to the left of the vertebral column.

The wound track from the left flank into the aorta was measured at
five and a half inches. It goes through the muscle.

Q. By wound track, what do we mean?

A. The track from the line of the knife, through the tissues, from the
entrance into the flank until it pierced the aorta.

All this space here lined the sac containing the organs, was filled
with blood because the aorta seized the aorta, when the damage causes
the bleeding into this area.

This area behind the front compartment contained quarts of blood.
Liters of blood.

Q. Now, to the right is -- could you make --

A. To the right.

Q. Do you relate the drawing to the right, to what you're explaining
to the jury now?

A. To the right is an enlargement of this area here.

Q. This area?

A. This area meaning the area where the knife has gone through the
aorta, comes out of the aorta on the other side and the tip of the
knife pierces the membrane, which is call the peritoneum.

Q. So --

A. This whole area here, in medical language is called the peritoneal
cavity because it is surrounded by a membrane called the peritoneum.

Q. And all of the blood then?

A. All the blood accumulated in the back compartment, in the
compartment behind the peritoneum called the retroperitoneal
compartment that is what this white area is, which also contains the
vertebral column, the aorta, the muscles along the spine, along the
vertebral column.

Q. Does the -- does the chest cavity have any blood?

A. No. The chest cavity has a few -- has maybe a fifth of an ounce of
fluid that is there to lubricate the surface, but contains no blood.

Q. So all of the blood went to the area you described?

A. All the blood, as soon as the aorta was cut, head into the space
behind the peritoneum.

Q. In terms of the chest cavity, does it generally have blood or
you're talking about in this particular case?

A. The chest cavity has no blood. There is no free blood anywhere in
the body except if there is an injury to a blood vessel.

Q. Now --

A. When I say free blood I mean loose blood, blood that's shed.

Q. Now, you mentioned and explain to us the hundred milliliters to 200
in the abdominal cavity?

A. 100 ml is described at the autopsy. One milliliter means three and
a third ounce.

Q. How about the jugular vein? You had mentioned earlier that there
was some cutting in the jugular vein area?

A. The left jugular vein was cut. In fact, the left jugular vein was
severed.

Q. Now --

A. The jugular vein is in the neck.

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, can we go back to question and answer forum
like we've done for years in court?

THE COURT: It would be nice.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Yes, sir. Would -- is the bleeding from the
jugular vein similar to, or different than bleeding from the carotid
artery that you described, that was slashed of Nicole Brown?

A. No comparison.

Q. Could you?

A. No comparison at all.

Q. Can you explain the difference to us?

A. The carotid artery being an artery that has a lot of pressure, the
heart -- can I make a drawing?

Q. Yes.

A. I'm not much of an artist. This is going to be very crude.

Here is the heart. The heart has two sides, the right side and the
left side. The left side of the heart generates the aorta. The wall of
the left side of the heart is thick. This is the wall of the left side
of the heart.

When the heart pumps, it squeezes, which when it squeezes again, it
has to loosen up, then it squeezes again.

When the heart pumps, it pushes blood on, under great pressure into
the aorta. From the aorta, all the blood vessels to the body run off.

The blood has to come back to the heart in order to be ejected by the
aorta. It comes back by way of the veins.

The veins, whereas the arteries run from the heart, the veins run to
the heart.

The wall on the right side of the heart is very thin because there is
no need for a lot of pumping because the blood comes back from the
head and neck area into the heart by gravity.

And in the lower extremities and the abdomen and chest, it comes back
because when the heart pumps and squeezes, the blood gets pushed out.
But when it relaxes, it creates a vacuum and that sucks the blood
back.

Veins suck, arteries eject under great pressure.

Therefore, the pressure in the jugular vein is very, very low. In
fact, it can be as low as zero because there is no need for pressure
from the head and neck. It runs down by gravity.

So there is -- When the jugular vein is cut, the bottom part of the
jugular vein sucks. The top dribbles out, dribbles down.

Q. Did the cut in Mr. Goldman's jugular vein cause outward bleeding,
in your opinion?

A. Very little of outward bleeding for two reasons.

First of all, there's no pressure. There's some outward trickle maybe,
but furthermore, I understand that there is tissue over the jugular
vein, muscle, fat, skin.

Q. Is there --

A. And I realize that the muscles are cut, but there not being any
pressure when the trickle occurs, the trickle would not bleed outward
but bleed inward, if at all.

Q. Is there any description in the autopsy report of a large amount of
blood in the soft tissue of the neck or the chest?

A. No. There's no description. There's description that there is blood
along the wound track, but no blood anywhere else.

Q. Any photographs to indicate the swelling, or evidence of swelling,
showing large amounts of blood in the soft tissue?

A. No.

Q. Of the neck or chest?

A. No. There are abundant pictures of the neck and chest area and
there is no swelling seen anywhere, nor is there a discoloration seen.

Q. Is the cause of death in this case a large amount of blood that
came from a jugular vein then?

A. No. There's only one cause of death here and the cause of death
here is the cut -- cuts in the aorta.

Q. How long before Mr. Goldman would become incapacitated and die if
he received the two stab wounds that you describe to the aorta?

A. Mr. Goldman would have been incapacitated and collapsed as he
bleed. He's unconscious. He's still bleeding, his heart is still
trying to contract weaker and weaker and weaker.

MR. BAKER: Move to strike as nonresponsive as to time, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Strike --

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) About --

A. Consequently.

MR. BAKER: Could we get an answer to the question, not consequently.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Approximately how long would it take for him to
die?

A. It may take him several minutes to die, but he is dying from the
moment the aorta is cut.

Q. Is there, in your opinion, because of the nature of the bleeding
you described, a likelihood of much blood, if any, going on to the
assailant?

MR. BAKER: Asked and answered.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: No.

Because Mr. Goldman did not bleed externally to a great extent.

The bleeding in the thigh bled into the pants, and stained the pants.
There is some bleeding from the other wounds, and possibly there is
some blood coming out on the knife as it is withdrawn between stab
wounds. But that doesn't necessarily come on the assailant.

And if it does, there would be splatters and not tremendous large
amounts of bleeding. This bleeding from the aorta is within tissue of
the back, the compartment of the abdominal area.

Q. Let me move to a different area.

We would mark the drawing, Your Honor, as next in order, which I
believe is 2160.

THE CLERK: 2161.

MR. MEDVENE: 2161.

THE COURT: So marked.

(The instrument herein referred to as drawing of heart done by
Dr.'Spitz was marked for identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No.
2161.)

(BY MR. MEDVENE) If I might move to another area.

Do you have an opinion as to whether all of the injuries inflicted on
Ms. Brown and Mr. Goldman could have been inflicted by one individual?

A. Yes. I'm of the opinion that all of the injuries of both victims
could have been inflicted by one individual, by a single individual.

Q. And what do you base that on?

A. First of all, I base that on the fact that the injuries on Nicole
took 15 seconds or less. And when I say 15 seconds, I'm being very
generous with time. I think probably less.

Once she was cut in the throat, they -- she was inactive. She was
collapsed. Instantaneously, immediately. The nature and the locations
of the wounds is, for practical purposes, the same or very similar in
both people.

Having said that my opinion is that one assailant caused these two --
The injuries in both people.

Q. Is there any evidence, in your judgment, that more than one knife
was used?

A. No. The injuries are totally compatible with a single knife.

Q. Could all of the injuries be caused by a single edged knife?

A. Yes.

Q. What is a single edge knife?

A. A single edged knife is a knife -- may I go to the board?

Q. Yes.

(Witness draws another diagram.)

A. A single edge knife is a knife that has a sharp edge on one side
and not the other. The other side is blunt.

A double edged knife is one that has a sharp edge on one side and a
sharp edge on the other. That would be a knife that is sometimes
referred to as stiletto would sometimes be referred to as a
stiletto-type knife.

Q. Dr. Spitz, you discussed the altercation, the fight between the
assailant and the two victims. Would the assailant, in your opinion,
have any injuries on his person or marks on his person as a result of
the struggle?

MR. BAKER: Calls for speculation.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: In the course of the struggle, there is holding of the
victims, each one from the back where the victim, obviously being
unarmed and capacity -- and rendered incapacitated by the hold, trying
to get away. During this holding, the victim one or the other, or
both, tried to remove the arm and hand from the hold.

During -- and this is a desperate attempt on the part of the victim.

During this desperate attempt, injuries from fingernails are likely to
be inflicted to the -- holding the extremity, to the hold of the
assailant.

Q. Would you put on the board please exhibit 171.

THE COURT: Who you talking to?

MR. MEDVENE: I'm sorry, Your Honor. Would you please put on the TV
monitor, exhibit 171?

(Exhibit 171 is displayed.)

(The instrument herein referred to as a photo description card of O.J.
Simpson's finger was marked for identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit
No. 171)

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Photo of Mr. Simpson's finger. Can you look at
that photograph that we've stated, for the record, was taken June 13,
some time in the afternoon and tell us what you observed?

A. I observed the middle finger with an injury over the -- roughly,
middle of the finger which oozes which is swollen, as evident from the
highlights around and from the general appearance of swelling. And
there is some discoloration and there is some blood around from this
injury.

And there is a second injury in this area here.

Q. I just placed before you, the actual photos.

A. Yes. And there is a second injury which is not terribly well
visible on this picture, but it's very well visible on the picture
that you handed me. Here, in this area, there's a second injury.

Q. That's above the nail?

A. I'm sorry?

Q. It's above the nail. I'm trying to describe it for the record.

A. No, it's not. It's below the nail.

Q. Below the nail?

A. But it's on the finger. It's right here. There's one injury here,
there's one injury here and there is something here, which I'm not
quite certain of, but is an injury -- this is an injury and both are
in my judgment fingernail marks.

Q. Let's go to 172.

(Exhibit 172 is displayed.)

A. This is the picture that was originally shown to me, and it shows
the same that 187 shows, except it's out of focus and shows it less
well.

Q. When you said 187, that would be 171, sir?

A. 171.

Q. Yes, sir.

A. It's the same area and the same injury.

Q. All right. There was reference made yesterday to exhibit 714 and
715 and, Steve, would you -- would you put on the board, number 9
from, I believe, 715.

(Mr. Foster complies.)

Q. Shown yesterday, I believe, during Dr. Huizenga's testimony.

I'm going to place a copy of that in front of you, placing four
pictures in front of you. First one is, I believe, number 9. You can
look on the back and I ask you, if you would, look on the TV monitor,
tell us what marks, if any, you observe.

Let's start with that and then what I'm going to ask you to do, is
circle those marks on the exhibit, the colored laser print that's in
front of you.

A. Let me be sure that I understood. You want me to explain the
picture?

Q. Yes.

A. On the monitor and then circle what I've talked about on the
picture on the -- on the -- on this ticket (indicating)?

Q. Yes, sir.

A. Okay.

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, this is the same picture he just talked about.
This is cumulative, sir.

THE COURT: Overruled.

MR. BAKER: The same cuts. I have an objection.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: This picture shows the same injury that we have talked
about, except later.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Okay.

A. And they show less swelling and more detail of the wounds. Because
the swelling has subsided and the wounds are not oozing any more.

The detail of the wounds is noticeable to a much better -- in a much
better way. What you are seeing is the wounds on the inside on the --
on the outside of the finger. And the wounds over the middle joint of
the finger, which is what I described earlier. Both wounds now are
much more explicit with regards to being fingernail marks.

You see the curvature on both, which is compatible with the curvature
of the fingernail and they -- the location of these wounds on the hand
is the result of this hand being exposed to the victim's hand when the
removal -- attempt to remove this hand was in progress.

Q. Would you please circle --

A. I did.

Q. May we mark this document 2162, Your Honor?

(The instrument herein referred to as a photo of hand with wounds was
marked for identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 2162.)

THE COURT: So marked.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Going to display quickly on the screen what you
marked, and ask for the record, if those are the places where you say
there were fingernail marks.

(Witness indicates with pointer.)

Q. Yes, sir. Let's go, if we can, to another photo introduced
yesterday, number 13, I believe, of 715. Is this a different mark than
we previously observed or you previously talked about on 2162?

A. This is a different mark. This is a different mark. These are two
different marks.

Q. Could you identify?

A. And again, here, this is -- this is one. And this is the other.

Q. The one is the one you said was the one -- was about where on the
ruler?

A. The one on this would be at the level of two-and-a-half inches.

Q. All right.

A. Two-and-a-half inches.

Q. All right.

A. Two-and-a-quarter to two-and-a-half inches.

Q. And the other one you pointed out?

A. And the other one is at one and three-quarters, approximately.

Q. And what?

A. So --

Q. What do those marks --

A. Those are, again, you'll have the curvature here. You'll have the
raggedness of the edge of the -- raggedness of the edge here. You have
a piece of tissue hanging out of this one.

Q. What are those marks?

A. Those are fingernail marks.

Q. Could those marks be from a cut glass?

A. No. Those are not cuts. These are injuries that were caused by --
not by sharp force, but by semi-blunt force.

Q. We'll mark it 2163. Would you be good enough to circle on what you
have, I believe it's 13, in front of you and could you also initial
it, please?

A. Initial it?

Q. Yes, sir.

Q. I'm going to ask you, with the Court's permission, if you could
also initial 2162.

(Witness complies.)

Q. Thank you. Could you put on the screen, may we mark this 2163, Your
Honor? j.

Would you put 2163 on the board, please.

(The instrument herein referred to as Photo with circles drawn by
witness was marked for identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No.
2163.)

Q. Are those what you described as fingernail marks?

A. Yes.

Q. Let me put back on the board for a moment, 2162.

(Exhibit 2162 is displayed.)

Q. I'm sorry, let me put back on the TV screen, the monitor, 2162.

And I ask you if what you have marked there in your picture, those
marks could have been caused by a glass cut?

A. No. These are not glass cuts.

Q. Thank you.

A. These are not sharp injuries. These are not caused by a glass and
these are not caused by a knife.

Q. If we can -- thank you.

If we can go now to number 8 of 715.

Another picture of Mr. Simpson's finger that was shown yesterday.

(Number 8 of Exhibit 715 is displayed on screen.)

Q. Do you see any marks on his finger that you could identify for the
jury?

A. Yes. There are two gouges. Gouges mean, where the upper layer of
the skin has been scooped out and it's gone. On both, here in the
front, which is the inner aspect of the base of the left index finger
on my hand. This would be right there.

Q. Which is this one?

A. This one is on the rib of the thumb, which is where I'm showing now
(indicating to his own hand).

These two are scooped out gouges by fingernail marks. They are typical
for that.

Q. Those two marks consistent with being a cut which glass?

A. No. These are not glass cuts.

Q. Would you be good enough, mark on the laser print before you, what
we've marked as 2164, the inner nail marks that you described.

A. (Witness complies.)

Q. And initial it, please.

(The instrument herein referred to as a photo of flesh with marks was
marked for identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 2164.)

Q. Put that up and identify, for purposes of the record, what those
marks are, the ones that you described. Are those the marks?

A. Yes. Yes, sir.

(Displayed photo with circle marks by witness.)

Q. Are there any photographs you -- Strike that.

You have talked earlier about a text that you edited and wrote?

A. Yes.

Q. In that text, are there any photographs of fingerprints or --
excuse me.

A. Fingernail marks.

Q. Fingernail marks?

A. Yes, there are.

Q. And have you -- strike that.

We'll put on the board -- put on the board what's been marked 1973.

MS. BLUESTEIN: Screen.

THE COURT: Excuse me, we'll put on the monitor what's been marked as
1973.

(Exhibit 1973 is displayed.)

(The instrument herein referred to as Photo of hand with fingernail
marks was marked for identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 1973.)

A. This is a hand with fingernail marks. This is not in focus.

MR. BAKER: Wait a minute. I'm going to object to this. Take that off
the screen. I want to approach.

THE COURT: Okay. Take it off.

(The following proceedings were held at the bench:)

MR. BAKER: Evidence Code 721, he can't use on direct, his book and his
photos. He can't do that under the Evidence Code 721. He can only be
cross-examined.

MR. MEDVENE: Well, they're in the exhibit book. They've been there for
a while. There's been no objection to them and we're using them to
show that he's going to compare the fingerprint marks with the ones
that he -- in the book or that he's collected with the fingernail to
support his conclusion that the fingernail marks, that the marks on
Mr. Simpson's finger are fingernail marks.

MR. BAKER: Can't do it, Your Honor. You can't use -- you can't use
your own writings to support it. He can only be cross-examined on his
own writings under 721(b) of the Evidence Code.

In fact, the Evidence Code, the fact they're in the evidence book is
meaningless.

THE COURT: What's the foundation for the photo?

MR. MEDVENE: Going to lay the foundation that he's taken the photo.
He's aware of the photo and all he wants to do, if it's permissible,
is compare the photo.

THE COURT: What's the foundation for the photo?

MR. MEDVENE: His knowledge of the taking of the photo and the source
of the marks.

THE COURT: Excuse me. Did he take the photo?

MR. MEDVENE: I'll have to ask him.

THE COURT: You don't know, do you?

MR. MEDVENE: I really don't, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Okay.

(The following proceedings were resumed in open court in the presence
of the jury:)

THE COURT: Ten minute recess, ladies and gentlemen. Don't talk about
the case, don't form or express any opinions.

(Jurors resume their respective seats.)

(The following proceedings were held in open court, in the presence of
the jury.)

THE COURT: There's an objection pending.

MR. MEDVENE: If the Court please, the picture was taken under the
supervision of Dr. Spitz, and results from a strangulation case where
the victim supposition would have acted in a similar way. That's our
foundation, Your Honor.

MR. BAKER: I don't think that's adequate foundation.

Number one, under 721 of the Evidence Code, he cannot be examined, and
his supposition is pretty loose; and,

Number two, his supposition as to how somebody was struggling is
exactly the same supposition he's made here today. I don't think
that's appropriate foundation for either supposition.

THE COURT: You may inquire.

MR. MEDVENE: Do it now, sir?

THE COURT: Well, yeah, before the jury comes in, so I can decide.

MR. MEDVENE: Yes, sir.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Dr. Spitz, with respect to the picture, could you
tell us what part, if any, you had in the taking of that picture?

A. Your Honor, I was the chief medical examiner. And the picture -- we
had a photographer -- two photographers, actually and the photographer
would take pictures of deceased people at my direction. And I would
tell the photographer what I wanted photographed, how I wanted it
photographed; and what he would do is focus and pull the shutter.

THE COURT: Okay. Further foundation as to its relevance?

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) And the particular victim, or the particular hand
that was photographed, what was the event that encompassed the injury
on the hand?

A. This is a strangulation case, where an assailant had his arm around
the victim and strangled her.

MR. MEDVENE: That's our foundation.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) What does the photo intend to illustrate?

A. Well, you see, this is a textbook, and it's meant to depict typical
injuries for students of this discipline, and so, depicts a typical
type of a fingernail mark.

Q. And?

A. Fingernail marks may be difficult to diagnose, especially for
somebody who is learning the profession.

Q. And what is the similarity, if any, between the photograph of a
different person and the marks that you described on Mr. Simpson's
finger?

A. Well, I think there is considerable similarity.

Q. If you want, we can put it back up.

A. Well, I know what it shows, but I think there is considerable
similarity.

Fingernail marks may have different configurations. Some fingernail
marks look this way; other fingernail marks look differently. And this
fingernail mark, or the fingernail marks on the picture in question,
are very much like the fingernail marks in question here. They are
ragged; they are jagged; they are the same similar size. I mean,
everything about this is the same.

MR. MEDVENE: May I approach, Your Honor?

THE COURT: You may.

(BY MR. MEDVENE) I place before you -- oh, I'm sorry.

(Defense counsel reviews book.)

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) I'm placing before you, your book, Medicolegal
Investigation of Death, third edition, in particular page 265.

And could you tell the Court the heading and the purpose.

A. The -- what do you mean by "purpose?"

Q. The purpose of those photos.

A. Oh. The purpose of the photos is to show fingernail marks
resembling gouges, as the caption indicates, on victims' wrists,
indicating a struggle had taken place. The struggle in this case was a
struggle to get a hand off somebody's neck.

Q. And are those the photos that we put on the board --

A. Yes.

Q. -- on the monitor?

Is that one of the photos?

A. One the photos, yes.

Q. And are you using it just for an illustrative purpose?

A. That's correct.

MR. MEDVENE: That's our foundation.

THE COURT: Well, the foundation is, I think, still lacking as to how
this witness determined that the photograph that he had his
photographer make shows fingernail marks.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) How do you know it's a fingernail mark?

A. Well, for several reasons.

First of all, it looks like fingernail marks.

Secondly, there is no other type of trauma.

Thirdly, we know how the strangulation occurred. I cannot, as I sit
here, tell you whether the police found other evidence that would be
corroborative or not, but there is no question in my mind. I would not
have put it in the book as a typical case if it weren't a fingernail
mark.

THE COURT: On that basis, I think foundation is lacking.

Sustain the objection.

MR. MEDVENE: All right, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Bring the jury back.

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, on the basis of what was just related, I would
move to strike all of his opinions from the testimony relative to what
are fingernail marks.

He obviously relied on what's in his book. There's inadequate
foundation to show those are fingernail marks. I move to strike all of
his testimony relative to his opinions concerning the cuts on Mr.
Simpson's hands being fingernail marks.

THE COURT: That motion is denied.

This witness is testifying as an expert. Whatever experience and basis
on which he formed those opinions, subject to your cross-examination,
will simply go to its weight.

(Jurors resume their respective seats.)

(The following proceedings were held in open court, in the presence of
the jury.)

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Dr. Spitz, before the break, I inadvertently, on
2164 -- that's number 8 -- showed you a picture, and I believe I
referred to it as a finger.

MR. BAKER: I object, Your Honor. He did not refer to it as a finger.

MR. MEDVENE: Well.

THE COURT: Overruled. Just start.

MR. MEDVENE: Okay.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Could you tell me, did you have an opportunity,
Doctor, to look at 2164 -- that's number 8 -- at the break?

A. Yes.

Q. And could you just -- whatever I called it, could you tell me what
it is?

MR. BAKER: I object. He didn't call it anything.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: The error was mine.

I attributed the gouges on the web side of the hand, and it is the
opposite side of the hand, two gouges on the side of the little, pinky
finger.

Q. Okay. And?

A. And they show -- you see the edge of the -- of a bone here, and
under the skin, a little, white tissue area.

Q. Can you see the whole hand from the picture?

A. No, you cannot. That's where I made the error, because it's too
close.

Q. Place on the board number 2, I believe, from 715, and ask if you
would please put it on the screen.

(Photo displayed.)

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) This is Mr. Simpson's hand, discussed yesterday by
Dr. Huizenga.

Can you tell the jury rather, the Court, if you see any marks on Mr.
Simpson's hand?

A. Yes, I see marks. I see little -- a row of little superficial
injuries, drying injuries on the back of the left hand, in proximity
of the middle knuckle, and at least one additional one there.

Q. Can you please circle them on the copy in front of you and initial
them.

(The witness complies.)

MR. MEDVENE: Exhibit 2165, Your Honor.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Can you give us your opinion of the cause of those
marks?

A. These are my view of fingernail marks, too.

Q. Why? What causes you to say that?

A. These are little superficial gouges. And the reason that there are
many is because they're skipping; the movement caused the hand of the
individual in collecting these, to skip from one to the next, to the
next, to the next. And here on the other one, it didn't skip.

Q. Dr. Spitz, in your opinion, would one that causes fingernail marks
on another individual necessarily have that other individual's skin
underneath their nails?

MR. BAKER: Leading. Suggestive.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Do you have an opinion whether or not the person
who received the fingernail -- excuse me -- do you have an opinion
whether or not the person who caused the fingernail marks would
necessarily have skin underneath their nails?

A. No.

MR. BAKER: Leading. Suggestive, as well, Your Honor.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Why not?

A. Well, because in the case of gouges, there's a substantial amount
of skin. The skin, many times, remains suspended on the individual on
whom the fingernail mark is.

It remains suspended; it does not get any blood; it dries up and falls
off in a day or two.

MR. MEDVENE: Would you put on the board 826, please.

Q. Doctor, I show you a picture that's been previously marked. It's of
Mr. Simpson somewhere prior to -- I believe the facts are somewhere
prior to 7:00 p.m. on June the 12th.

I ask you to look at that picture.

If we can narrow it down or get a close-up of Mr. Simpson's hands.

(Photo displayed.)

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Do you see on Mr. Simpson's hand in this picture,
taken sometime on the 12th before 7:00 p.m. at his daughter's recital,
any of what you have identified as the fingernail marks?

A. No, I don't see any here.

If you make it less magnified, there are no -- there are no marks
here, either.

Q. I have nothing further, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Cross-examine.

MR. BAKER: Put up 2165.

CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. BAKER:

Q. Those are -- all of those marks that you've circled, Dr. Spitz, are
about the size of the head of a pin or less, right?

(Exhibit 2165 displayed.)

THE WITNESS: Well, they're not very large, though.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) About the size of a head of a pin, right?

A. I don't know. I can't tell you whether they're the size of a head
of a pin or less, depending on the pin. I suppose there are pins with
little heads and big heads.

There's no scale on this. I could say that they are small, but I
cannot tell you how small they are.

Q. And in virtually -- as I understand your testimony, virtually every
cut, abrasion that you saw on Mr. Simpson's hand, it's your opinion,
was caused by a fingernail, correct?

A. Well, those I saw are, in my opinion, fingernail marks.

Q. And this obviously was a sharp fingernail because they're very
little cuts and they're not broad-base cuts, right?

You understand the question?

A. No.

Q. What was it, a pointed fingernail that skipped across the top of
Mr. Simpson's hand that caused that?

A. No.

Q. All right.

Now, in terms of your opinions relative to these fingernail marks,
there was absolutely nothing found under Mr. Goldman's fingernails
that matched anything having to do with Mr. Simpson, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And the only thing that was found under any fingernail in this
case, was found under the fingernail of Nicole Brown Simpson; and that
genetic marker matched neither Mr. Simpson nor Mr. Goldman nor anyone
that was knowledgeable to be at the crime scene, true?

A. Yes.

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Assumes facts not in evidence, Your Honor.
Move to strike about the genetic markers.

THE COURT: Counsel asked the question; the witness answered.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, Dr. Spitz, as I understand it, you have spent
considerable time on this matter, have you not?

A. Yes.

Q. And you bill $3,000 per day?

A. For what?

Q. For doing what you're doing today?

A. For testifying in Los Angeles, yes.

Q. Or testifying in Detroit, Michigan?

A. No.

Q. Now, you would agree you're well compensated for your forensic
pathology testimony, correct?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Calls for conclusion, Your Honor. I mean
vague, ambiguous, "well compensated."

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: I don't know if my testimony's well compensated or not.
This is my fee schedule; this is what I bill, whether I'm billing one
party or another party.

Q. Well, It's your view that forensic pathologists take sides in a
case, is it not, sir?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Vague, ambiguous as to what point in time,
Your Honor, before or after an opinion has been drawn.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: I don't know if that's the right way of putting it. You
don't take sides; you interpret the evidence.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Well, let me read what you told the Detroit News on
October 17, 1994. Quote: "Invariably, the forensic pathologist will
take sides."

Do you recall saying that?

A. Can you read me the whole sentence.

Q. I'd be happy to.

A. Or could you let me see it, perhaps.

Q. Let me read it to you.

A. I'd like to -- if you don't mind, I'd like to see it.

Q. Did you --

MR. MEDVENE: Excuse me. Could we have a copy, Mr. Baker, of what --

THE COURT: If you're going to read from something, show it to counsel.

MR. BAKER: Sure.

(Counsel reviews document.)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You have -- while they're looking at that, you have
-- you have given a lot of interviews to various media relative to the
O.J. Simpson case, have you not, Dr. Spitz?

A. I've given some, yes.

Q. And you have been quoted in the L.A. Times?

A. I've been quoted in the Detroit paper.

Q. And others, true?

A. I don't know where I've been quoted. Those I read, I can tell you,
but then, many I didn't read.

Q. All right.

Now, in terms of this case, you would agree that you were taking sides
relative to the plaintiffs' position in the case, correct?

A. No.

Q. All right.

And you wouldn't be taking sides, correct?

You just, in looking at the evidence, giving your best independent
judgment of what that is, true?

A. I believe that I looked at the evidence in this case and
interpreted it the best way I know how.

Q. Fair enough.

Now, you told the -- let me get the name of the paper correct -- The
Detroit News --

MR. MEDVENE: Excuse me.

MR. BAKER: -- October 17 --

MR. MEDVENE: Your Honor, this is out of context. The two sentences
before -- put it in context. It's unfair to ask it this way. The
witness says --

MR. BAKER: Don't need an argument.

THE COURT: Excuse me?

MR. BAKER: I'm sorry.

THE COURT: Excuse me. You may rehabilitate your witness at a later
time if you wish.

MR. MEDVENE: But he's reading from a document unfairly. He's -- if you
could look at the document.

THE COURT: Excuse me. This is cross-examination. And let's proceed.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You told the Detroit News on October 17, 1994, in
talking about the O.J. Simpson case, "Invariably, forensic
pathologists will take sides, who are not part of the prosecution at
all. We work in an adversarial system. Some other expert is going to
come in and try to challenge us."

That's what you told the Detroit News, correct?

A. I couldn't tell you; I don't know. Maybe I did tell them that;
maybe I did not.

Q. Have you ever written to -- the Detroit News is a paper in your
hometown --

A. Yes.

Q. -- is it not?

A. And --

Q. Do you read it?

A. No; I read The Free Press.

Q. I'm sorry?

A. I read The Free Press.

Q. Okay.

Have you ever indicated to the Detroit News or The Free Press that
you've been misquoted?

MR. MEDVENE: If the Court please, may we approach? This is unfair.
He's quoting part of it --

MR. BAKER: You know --

MR. MEDVENE: -- out of context.

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, his characterization of unfair is improper.

THE COURT: Excuse me. He's making a speaking objection and you're
making a speaking response. I don't think it's helpful to anybody.

Objection's overruled. Let's get on with it and finish this.

MR. MEDVENE: Yes, sir.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, in this case, you talked about being -- being
part of the select committee to investigate the assassination of JFK
and Martin Luther King. Do you recall that?

A. Yes.

Q. The chairman of that committee was Michael Baden?

A. Yes.

Q. You know who Michael Baden is, do you not, Dr. Spitz?

A. Yes.

Q. You're aware he was called by the defense in the criminal case?

A. Yes.

Q. And you are aware that he is going to be called by the defense in
this case?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Relevance, materiality, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, let's talk just a little bit about you were
retained in January, February of this year?

A. I think it was January.

Q. And from that day to this day, have you prepared a single note
relative to this case, Dr. Spitz?

A. No, I have not.

Q. Not one single piece of paper, you will agree, that you have
prepared relative to this case, correct?

A. That's correct.

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Asked and answered.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, Doctor, how much blood is contained in the
average human body?

A. I don't know. I suppose it varies. And there is no complete
agreement, I don't believe, in that regard. I would say, I would
estimate maybe eight quarts.

Q. Doctor, isn't it true that there's eight to ten quarts of blood in
a human body?

A. That may be.

Q. So, eight quarts is two gallons?

A. Eight quarts is two gallons.

Q. And in this particular case, you are of the view that Ms. Nicole
Brown Simpson died or -- strike that.

There was 15 seconds or less between the first and the last wound,
correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, sir, will you put that -- Phil will you put that card -- well,
never mind.

You would agree, Dr. Spitz, that the way the human body functions, is
that for us to survive, we have to have oxygenated blood to every part
of our body, right?

A. Yes.

Q. And what occurs is that the heart pumps blood in a closed system,
if there aren't any cuts or vents, if you will, in any part of the
cardiovascular system, true?

A. Yes.

Q. And what occurs is, as we inhale, we send oxygen down into our
lungs; the oxygen transfers and goes into the blood through the lungs,
and is pumped from to the various parts of every part of our body,
true?

A. Yes.

Q. And if, in fact, we do not get oxygenated blood to our body for a
period of time, that tissue that is deprived of oxygenated blood will
become necrotic or gangrenous and die, true?

A. I suppose, yes.

Q. And so the system --

A. There -- excuse me. Though, that is only partially correct, because
what happens if you don't get oxygenated blood to every part of the
body, as you say, the whole body is going to die. And then once it
dies, then we become gangrenous or decomposes, you might say, but it's
not that, as we are alive, little bits and pieces of us start falling
apart. That's not how it works.

Q. Well, Doctor, let me just see if maybe we can get on the same
wavelength.

If I take and put a tourniquet around my arm at the forearm level and
tighten it so as to preclude oxygenated blood flow from going through
there, the first thing that will occur is, everything posterior or
distal to the tourniquet is going to turn blue, correct?

A. No, it's not going to turn blue; it's going to turn white. It's
only going to turn blue if you obstruct the veins. If you obstruct the
arteries and you put a tourniquet on the arm, then you will obstruct
the arteries; it's going to turn white because it's not going to get
any blood.

Q. Doctor, it's going to have blood in it before you ever put the
tourniquet on it?

A. Well, it's got blood in it now.

Q. That's what I mean.

A. As a result of that, my hand is not blue. At least I don't think
so.

Q. Well, I agree with you; I don't think it is, because it's got
oxygenated blood in it.

In any event, Doctor, let me move on.

The blood customarily is depicted -- our arterial blood flow is red in
your medical circles, is it not, and blue when it's on the venous
return, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And what occurs is that, after the oxygenation has been used to
nourish the various tissues in the body, the unoxygenated blood flows
through the veins, back to the lungs, to be reoxygenated and pumped
again by the heart, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And when that occurs, if we take and have a situation where we are
frightened, scared, at the risk of losing our life, a couple of things
happen to the human body, do they not?

One is that the heart rate increases dramatically, true?

A. Yes.

Q. The other is that the blood vessels constrict; that is, the aorta
and the vessels that feed not only the aorta or the vessels that feed
various parts of our body constrict, so that to pump more blood
quicker to the various areas, true?

A. There is a constriction which raises the blood pressure. The amount
of blood that flows remains the same.

What happens is, there's a regulatory system in the body, and that
regulatory system provides no constrictions, which at the same time
increases blood-vessel pressure. So the amount of blood that comes out
is the same when you are scared or not scared.

Q. Doctor, that's actually exactly what I was getting at.

If you take a person that has a blood pressure and -- let's talk about
systolic pressure, okay, because that's the pressure when the left
side of the heart pumps and the blood is then pushed through our body,
correct?

A. Yes; that's what I mentioned earlier.

Q. And if the systolic blood pressure is 110, that means that the
blood pressure will hold up a column of 110 millimeters of mercury,
true?

A. Yes.

Q. And that is the pressure that will increase during a time of fright
or when the victim is afraid, correct?

A. I just said that the blood pressure rises.

Q. And so you can get a blood pressure over 200 at the time that you
are, in fact, frightened?

A. Yes.

Q. True?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, the blood pressure, when there is a cut in the enclosed system
that we, as human beings have, that keep the blood inside of our
bodies, if it is then severed, that blood, especially in an area such
as the carotid arteries, comes out of the human body with great force,
does it not?

A. It comes out with great force; however, at the same time, as you
correctly indicated a minute ago, there is constriction of the artery.
So it doesn't come out with a whole lot more force than it would have
if the blood pressure were lower.

Q. Doctor, if we take a hose and we use a three-quarter-inch hose, and
we have a volume of water going through that hose, and we reduce it to
a half-an-inch hose, and put the same -- increase the pressure by 50
to 100 percent, the amount of water coming out into that hose is going
to almost double. In other words, by that, I mean the distance that
that water will arc from the exit of the hose until it hits the
ground; you would agree with that?

A. No doubt. But the hose hasn't got a regulatory mechanism, nor have
I ever known of a hose that was scared.

(Laughter.)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Well, I certainly hope not.

Have you talked to many hoses?

A. No, not yet.

Q. Okay.

(Laughter.)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Be nice to me, now.

Now, doctor, In terms of the -- when a person is killed, after the
person is deceased, we don't bruise; you would agree with that?

A. That is only partially correct. If I may explain.

Yes, we do not bruise. However, if there is an injury that causes
blood vessels to rupture, like in a case of a -- what would have been
a black-and-blue mark, but is not because the individual is dead,
blood still runs out of the injured blood vessels. And because of the
pressure, even though little of the gravity of the blood, it will
somehow percolate into the environment, into the area of this injury.

So although there is no bruising -- the word "bruising" would be
incorrect to use -- but there would be some blood outside of a blood
vessel, which is the equivalent of a bruise in the area of damage.

Q. All right.

And you have, as I understand it, read and reviewed the autopsy
reports in some detail of both of the victims in this case, have you
not?

A. Yes.

Q. And as I understand it -- strike that.

Let me ask you this: You seem to have pretty certain opinions on
exactly how these events occurred. And I want to know -- tell us,
Doctor, how long before the first wound was inflicted did the
altercation take place?

A. How long before the first wound?

When you say "first wound" what do you mean, major wound, or do you
mean a defensive-type, scratch-like, superficial wound or any wound?

Q. Any wound, sir.

A. I don't have any idea.

Q. So you --

A. Before there was contact, I don't know what transpired.

Q. Okay. So I want to be clear, then, that you have no idea how long
the assailant or assailants were in the area where the murders took
place before there was a first wound?

A. I have -- I only can make a judgment for the duration of the period
that involves injury and incapacity and death, but not what occurred
before there was contact.

Q. Okay. So the answer to my question is, you don't have an opinion as
to how long the assailant or assailants was in the area where the
murders took place before the first wound was inflicted on whoever it
was inflicted on, right?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

Now, your view, as I understand it, is that Nicole Brown Simpson was
killed first, right?

A. That is my opinion.

Q. And your view is that the reason she was killed first is because if
she wasn't killed first, she would have run away, right?

That's what you testified to in your deposition, true?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

So -- and you believe from the first wound to the last wound was 15
seconds; and that given a lot of time, you think it's actually
possibly less than that, true?

A. Yes.

Q. And you are aware, of course, that Nicole Brown Simpson had a
bruise on her forehead in the upper portion of the head, that went
into brain tissue, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. That was a pretty good bruise, wasn't it?

A. Well, it's a bruise in the skin. The scalp bruise is about the size
of a silver dollar.

Q. So she was certainly alive at the time that that bruise was
inflicted, because bruises are not inflicted after the person's
deceased; I think we've already agreed on that, correct?

A. Well, this particular bruise, I agree with you, because there is an
injury to the adjacent brain.

Q. And your view relative to that particular bruise is that it didn't
cause her to be unconscious, nor was she severely subconscious,
correct?

A. No. My opinion about that bruise is that it could have dazed her. I
cannot really make a definitive judgment --

Q. Okay.

A. -- of how intense that bruise is.

The bruise, in and of itself, is not of the kind that would
necessarily cause loss of consciousness or severe subconsciousness,
that is, where she is still conscious, but barely.

I could not make a judgment on that.

I would rather think that the bruise was not of such magnitude, but it
could have significantly dazed her to the point where she would lose
her footing.

Q. Well, you testified when we took your deposition, that it may not
have affected her at all; it may have dazed her some.

A. Yes.

That's correct.

Q. Now, this bruise was inflicted, in your opinion, before there was
any wounds to her body, true?

A. No; I don't know specifically when that bruise occurred. It just as
well could have occurred as a result of striking the ground, and that
the slashing of the neck followed, because I'm nearly certain that the
slashing of the neck followed that bruise.

Q. Well, now, the slashing, as I understand it now, she had a couple
of defensive wounds on her hands; is that right?

A. She had a couple of defensive wounds on her hand.

Q. That didn't take, in your view, any time at all, correct?

A. Well, nothing takes no time at all.

Q. A second, two seconds?

A. It takes very little time to inflict that, yes.

Q. And your view, of course, Dr. Spitz, is that when those wounds to
her hands were inflicted, the assailant was behind her, right?

A. To her hands?

Q. Yeah.

A. No. At one point, I said he was in front of her.

Q. Oh, okay.

So the assailant was in front of her at one time; and within 15
seconds, the assailant is behind her, has stabbed her four times in
the face and slashed her throat; and this is even before she has any
contusions at all, true?

A. No.

No, not true.

Q. Well, in your opinion, when the assailant or assailants are in
front of Ms. Nicole Brown Simpson, did she have the contusion to her
head that may not have affected her at all, or may have affected her,
or may have caused her severe subconsciousness?

A. You're asking me whether she already had that? Is that what you're
asking me?

Q. I'm asking you, sir: When the assailant or assailants were in front
of Ms. Nicole Brown Simpson and she got these defensive wounds to her
hands, had she already incurred the bruise to her head and brain?

A. I doubt that, although it's not impossible.

I don't know when she sustained the bruise to the head. She could have
--

Q. She couldn't have sustained the bruise to the head after the slash
to the neck; you'd agree with that?

A. I doubt that she sustained the bruise to the neck after the slash
of the neck.

Q. The bruise to the head after the slash to the neck.

A. Yeah, I think the slash of the neck was the last event.

Q. Because if, in fact, she had incurred the -- sustained a blow to
her head after the slash, there wouldn't be a bruise there; you'd
agree with that?

A. Or less of a bruise, yes.

Q. Now, we know that's a severe bruise because we know the brain is
bruised. It goes -- she's got a bruise an inch square on the top of
her head, where she's got the hemorrhagic blood tissue, and then she
has brain tissue underneath the skull, whereas the petechiae are also
infiltrated with blood?

A. I don't know what you mean. I don't know what you mean by
"petechiae."

Q. Okay.

Let me get the autopsy report. I may be totally wrong. It wouldn't be
the first time.

Okay.

It says there are focal areas of concentrated intercerebral petechiae
characteristics of acute cerebral cortical contusion; is that correct?

A. Yes. I think I said yes.

Q. Okay.

And that indicated to you that there was bleeding in the brain tissue
itself, true?

A. No. What that means is that the bruise or the contusion in the
brain consists of tiny, little gashes. The word petechiae, which are
pinpoint size hemorrhages, those are not -- that's not a massive
hemorrhage in the brain.

The bruise, one, consists when there is a bruise in the brain, or what
we call a bruise in the brain, consists of an area of brain tissue in
which are little pinpoint hemorrhages. That's what he means.

Q. It was a subdural hematoma; it was petechiae that had ruptured as a
result of the blow that she took to the head, correct?

A. No, no. The petechiae don't rupture.

When there is a blow to the head from falling on the floor or hitting
a wall, there develops a bruise or a black-and-blue mark in the brain.

What is a black and blue mark in the brain?

A black-and-blue mark in the brain is a little area -- or big area,
for that matter -- in this case, the size of -- silver-dollar-size
area in which there are a lot of pinpoint-size bleedings. And that is
what we look at when we say oh, there's a bruise in the brain.

Q. Okay.

Now, that indicated to you in doing your reconstruction of the time
frame within which it took for Nicole Brown Simpson, from the first
wound to the last wound, being 15 seconds or less, that sometime
between the assailant being in front of Nicole Brown Simpson and then
subsequently being behind her, that she went to the ground or fell and
lost her footing and hit one wall or the other, correct?

A. Or some other firm thing.

There's a bannister there. I don't know what she hit. She hit
something as she may have lost her footing, as she may have been
pushed, as she may have fallen because of some other reason, but in
that area. And I believe it's here that Nicole's head -- she hit
something flat and hard, consistent with paved floor or a wall.

Q. Now, you went out to the scene of the murders, did you not?

A. Yes.

Q. And you saw that in the area where her body was found, there was a
concrete stairway directly behind where her body was, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And there was a wall on either side of that stairwell that was rock
or concrete or whatever, something of substance, correct.

A. Yes.

Q. And she hit something and then went on the right side of her head,
as you pointed out, close to the top; isn't that true?

A. Yes, somewhere like I'm showing here.

Q. Yeah. And that is not -- if you're going to fall to the right or to
the left, that's not where you would normally hit your forehead, is
it, right up on the top on the right-hand side?

A. No I'm not saying here.

Q. No, I know; it's right here.

A. It's here.

Well, people fall --

Q. It's not on the side; it's closer to the top of the head?

A. Well, here in this area.

Q. Doctor, did you look at the pictures in the autopsy report as to
where that particularly was? Did you, sir?

A. I don't have it here.

Q. You've got it. Let me --

THE COURT: Is that one of the photographs that was not received?

MR. BAKER: No; it's a drawing in the autopsy report on a form, sir. It
isn't -- I gave it to you; I'm sorry.

(Indicating to reporter)

MR. BAKER: Did you review -- this is -- I guess this is just a form
28. 28, yeah. It's labeled 00049. Okay.

THE WITNESS: May I request, could we use the photograph rather than
the diagram, because the diagram is not as accurate as the photograph.

MR. PETROCELLI: We have a photo here, Your Honor. I believe it was on
the board, too.

MR. MEDVENE: It's 2016, I believe, Your Honor.

MR. BAKER: Okay.

(Counsel hands photo to witness.)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Dr. Spitz, that's up by where Ms. Brown had her hair
parted on the top?

A. It is above the ear. You can see -- in the picture, you can see Ms.
Simpson's nose.

Q. Can you answer my question, sir?

I said, it is up on the head, certainly above her ear, where she parts
her hair?

A. No.

Q. Towards the top?

A. No; I disagree.

Q. Then just answer the question.

A. I know it's not where she parts her hair.

Q. All you have to say is no.

A. There is a parting, but the parting is artificial, because the
parting is made to get the hair away, so it -- to enable the
photograph, because the area needs to be devoid of hair.

This is not where she normally keeps her parting.

Q. You're sure of that?

A. I'm sure of that.

Q. Okay.

A. Because the -- look at the parting. I cannot imagine that Ms.
Simpson would have a parting that's all zig-zag.

Q. You can't? Okay.

A. Besides, you see exactly where it is because you see the nose in
the picture.

Q. Okay.

Doctor, that indicates to you that she fell to the side?

A. Yes.

Q. And if she, in falling to the side, that type of blow, you would
agree that it's more likely than not that Nicole Brown Simpson went
all the way down to whatever was beneath her at the time she fell,
true?

A. I cannot tell you whether she definitely struck the stair or the
floor or the wall. I -- the bruise does not permit a very definitive
conclusion. All that the bruise says is that she could have hit the
floor in any one of these areas.

Q. But after she hit it, she went all the way down; in your opinion,
more likely than not, Nicole Brown Simpson then went to the area of
the walkway where her body was found, that she went all the way down
on her hands and was essentially prone on the walkway, it's terra
firma, whatever. You would agree with that?

A. She could have. She didn't have to.

Q. More likely than not, if in the struggle that caused this woman to
hit her head on a wall or a concrete step or a walkway, she went all
the way down to cause that degree of bruising; you would agree with
that?

A. First of all, this is not a huge bruise. This -- she could have
gone all the way down; she didn't have to.

Q. Well, then, I got the impression, sir, from your testimony in the
last few hours in the courtroom, that you had done, in your mind, a
complete reconstruction of how these murders took place, how these
defensive wounds took place, and how these wounds were inflicted, to
come up with your opinion that within 15 seconds from the time the
first wound was inflicted, Ms. Nicole Brown Simpson was deceased or
had a fatal wound inflicted on her; and within less than one minute
from the first wound of Ron Goldman, he had a fatal wound inflicted in
him.

So, is that correct? You did a full reconstruction of how these
murders took place, in your mind, that you're willing to sit here and
tell us about?

Yes?

A. Yes.

Q. Yes or no?

A. Yes, I do --

Q. Thank you.

A. -- However

Q. Thank you.

Now, let's go through it. After Nicole Brown Simpson is in front of
the assailant and has defensive wounds inflicted upon her hands, is
she standing in front of the stairs?

A. I don't know where. Her fingernail -- her hands were injured.

Q. Is she standing on the stairs?

A. I don't know where the hands were injured.

Q. Was the assailant directly in front of her when the wounds were
inflicted upon her hands, sir?

A. I don't know. He could have stood sideways.

Q. Do you want to look at the autopsy report again and tell us whether
or not you believe that the assailant was sideways of Nicole?

A. Sideways, meaning -- you asked me whether he stood exactly in front
of her.

I don't know that. Maybe he -- there was somewhat of an angle. That's
what I'm trying to say. I don't know that the autopsy report indicates
that.

Q. Well, you can tell a little bit about how the assailant or
assailants and Nicole Brown Simpson were standing by the way the
wounds were inflicted, can you not?

A. I can say that the confrontation was from the front.

Q. Face to face?

A. Yes. But -- okay. Face to face, but not necessarily full face to
face.

Q. And then in your reconstruction scenario, Dr. Spitz, after she
takes a couple of defensive wounds to her hands, she then is knocked
or loses her footing to the extent that she takes this blow to the
head, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. That's before she's taken any stab wounds to any other area than
her hands, true?

A. I believe that's a likely scenario.

Q. And then, did you know if Nicole Brown Simpson was in good physical
condition?

A. I'm sorry?

Q. Did you know if she was in good shape and worked out and stayed
relatively muscular for her size and weight?

A. All I can -- I don't know if she worked out. I don't know. I don't
think she was weight-lifting. I don't know if she took steroids. I
doubt it. I can tell you that she was a healthy young woman.

Q. Do you know how easy it would be, for example, if she were standing
in front of the stairs, for an assailant to get behind her after the
assailant has been in front of her?

A. How easy it would be?

Q. Yeah.

A. That depends on the relative size of the assailant and her. For
some assailant, that would be very easy; for another assailant, it may
be more difficult.

Q. And then your scenario is that after she's down, she gets back up,
at least partially, and the assailant is behind her, right?

A. She does not necessarily get up.

Q. I thought you said that she was not unconscious and that the blow
to the brain, contusion, may not have affected her at all.

A. That is a possibility.

But once she is down, it is easy to grab her from behind and to pull
her head back and inflict the stab wounds and the slash.

Q. So your scenario is that after she hits the head, she is then down,
and the assailant goes behind her and pulls her head back and slashes
her throat, right, after she is at that time, let's say, quasi
conscious, she's been dazed, is that right, when he's inflicting
these?

A. I think she may have been dazed because of the injury at the sides
of her head. And she may have also been dazed because of a blow to her
mouth which may be the one that pushed her on over so that she
sustained the one -- the blow to the head. And at that moment, it
would be easy to grab her by the neck and --

Q. Okay. And you testified earlier today that the reason there were
four wounds to her face is because there was so much movement just
before the fatal wound was inflicted, that the assailant could not do
the job, essentially. And if that's true, Nicole Brown Simpson isn't
dazed at all, she's fighting, correct?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. It's a speech and it misstates the evidence;
assumes facts not in evidence.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. That's what you testified to --

MR. BAKER: Want to break?

THE COURT: Let's take a ten-minute recess.

Bring the jury back in ten minutes.

(Recess.)

(Jurors resume their respective seats.)

CROSS EXAMINATION (CONTINUED) BY MR. BAKER:

Q. Now, Dr. Spitz, as suggested, you've been to the crime scene?

A. Have I been to the crime scene?

Q. You have been there?

A. Yes, I have.

Q. You're aware that the area where Mr. Goldman's body was found, in
that dirt area over to the right, as you face the condominium facing
west is about six feet by four feet, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And the area where Ms. Nicole Brown Simpson's body was found would
add another 36 inches to that width and would be approximately the
same length, so would add another three feet by four feet, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And so that is a very, very closed-in area; is it not?

A. Yes, it is.

Q. And during the -- we have on the -- on the monitor, sir, a diagram
of that area.

Now, at the time the killing of Ms. Simpson was taking place, and you
say, with her confronting the assailant in front of her, whatever
happened after that, that caused her to fall and strike the right side
of her head and her mouth. And then the assailant, getting behind her
and then the four stab wounds on the left side of the face?

A. Of the neck.

Q. Neck, pardon me. Preceding the fatal wound to the neck that, in
your opinion, took less than 15 seconds, right?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay. And then, was it your opinion in your reconstruction that you
had done, in your mind, sir, that Mr. Goldman was in that closed-in
area during that 15 second altercation?

A. I think he probably was, but --

Q. Okay.

A. I really don't know that he was, but I think he probably was; or
was arriving at that time.

Well, I'm not sure. I'm not sure.

Q. You actually don't know 'cause you certainly weren't on the north
side of the fence, looking. This is your opinion based upon your
reconstruction; is it not?

A. Yes. My reconstruction is primarily based on wounds and not on the
overall field of criminalistics.

Q. Well, Dr. Spitz, I take it that before you come into court, you
raise your right hand and swear under penalty of perjury that you're
going to render your opinion, that you want to take into account,
every piece of information that you can so that your opinions are as
accurate as possible, true?

A. No. My oath relates to my giving truthful testimony to the best of
my ability, based on my area of expertise.

Q. I take it, before you come in here and tell this jury that the
whole struggle took a minute and 15 seconds or less, you want to
review and analyze all of the information that is available to you so
that you can render the best possible opinions that you have, true?

A. Of course.

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. It's been asked and answered.

MR. BAKER: I agree. It's been asked.

THE COURT: Well that's too productive.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, Dr. Spitz, in terms of the gate, that is the
front gate, sir, do you know whether that gate was locked or unlocked
before you rendered the opinion that Mr. Goldman was in the closed-in
area at the time the altercation with Nicole Brown Simpson took place?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, Your Honor. It misstates his testimony. He
didn't say he was in the area or not. He said he didn't know.

MR. BAKER: He said he believed he was in the area.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Did you just tell us, sir, that your best opinion
was that you believed Mr. Goldman was within the closed-in area that
you've depicted, by both the dirt and the walkway at the time the
altercation took place with Ms. Nicole Brown Simpson and the assailant
or assailants?

A. You're asking me whether I said that?

Q. Yeah. Do you believe that Mr. Goldman was in that area when that
altercation and struggle and ultimate demise of Ms. Brown Simpson took
place?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, Your Honor.

THE WITNESS: I believe --

MR. MEDVENE: Excuse me. Objection calls for conclusion, lack of
foundation. Witness said he wasn't there. He's just testifying from
wounds.

THE COURT: Overruled. The witness testified on direct examination as
to certain conclusions and defense has a right to cross-examine him.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Go ahead, sir.

A. I personally believe that he may have been there, but I'm not
basing that opinion on any scientific evidence or any material
evidence that I really have. My area of expertise are injuries.

Q. All right. Now, but you've opined here not only about injuries. You
opined about how long it took to get the injuries. You've opined about
what angles the assailant was. You've opined about how the knife
wounds were inflicted. And you weren't there when you opined about all
of those things, correct, sir?

A. No. No, all I did -- I testified to is appearance of injury, types
of injury, how injuries were inflicted, how long it took to inflict
the injuries, how much blood was lost from injuries, and this kind of
thing.

Every time you want to characterize my testimony, you'd have to submit
that it is -- my testimony intended to convey information about
wounds; about injuries, not whether who was present or how long
interaction took place before the first wound was inflicted. That, I
do not know.

Q. Now, sir, did -- the gate was locked and Ms. Nicole Brown Simpson
had to open the gate to allow Mr. Goldman in the gate. They would have
been approximately how far from each other, if Mr. Goldman's inside
the gate an Nicole Brown Simpson is down from the first step where her
body was found.

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, Your Honor. It assumes facts not in evidence.

THE COURT: Sustained. I don't think this witness is competent to
answer that.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Well, in terms of -- you've testified as to where
you thought the assailant was. You've testified as to you thought the
assailant was in front of, behind. You've testified that Nicole Brown
Simpson was killed first because if she wasn't killed first, she would
run away.

Those are all your opinions, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And in your opinions, and you sure don't know whether Nicole Brown
Simpson were to run away or not, do -- you weren't there and you've
never met her; isn't that true?

A. That's correct.

Q. And you've testified that the assailant was in front and then
around behind, and you weren't there and you don't know whether the
assailant was or wasn't in front of her, do you?

A. Yes, I do know that he was in front of her when the hand wounds
were inflicted. And I -- when I say -- let me repeat when I say in
front of her, I do not mean at a 90-degree angle or parallel to her.
What I mean is somewhere in the front semi-circle.

Q. And you don't know that it took any 15 seconds from the first
defensive wounds, to the last because you weren't there, isn't that
true, sir?

A. No.

Q. Okay. So you know that?

A. I know -- that's not the best way to say it. I know that to sustain
these type of injuries that Ms. Simpson had would take less than 15
seconds.

Q. Okay. And that -- I mean you sat up here and you demonstrated umpf,
umpf, umpf about three times with your hand and, you know, do you, Dr.
Spitz, that's how fast the assailant did it because you were there and
you saw him, right?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection.

THE COURT: It's argumentative.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You don't know, sir, how fast the wounds were
inflicted, do you, now, do you?

Would you just answer my --

A. Yes, I do know.

Q. Now, let's, in terms of your opinions relative to Mr. Goldman, as I
understand it, sir, you believe that the wounds to the left flank was
either the first wound or very early, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And that is the wounds that entered the left flank, and we'll put
the diagram --well, let me, wait a minute. I apologize.

Let's talk a little bit about the anatomy of a human being. In the
anatomy of a 25-year-old young man, we have, as you described, the
peritoneal cavity where you have the intestine, you have the large
intestine, the small intestine, you have the duodenum, spleen, and
that is --

A. The liver.

Q. -- The liver is all -- And it's from about the diaphragm down in
the abdomen, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And that is encased in that thin cell, fine-like membrane called
the peritoneum, true?

A. Yes.

Q. And the organs contained therein -- are called the -- or the area
is called the peritoneal cavity, true?

A. Yes.

Q. In the area behind the peritoneum is called the retroperitoneal
space, true?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, in the retroperitoneal space -- Phil, you want to put up that
side-view, if you can?

From the retroperitoneal space, we have -- that's a side-view and it
shows -- (indicating to TV screen) -- This would be the lungs up in
here and the thoracic lungs and thoracic cavity, right where I'm
pointing, with the red?

A. This is the heart.

Q. Well, but that's all in the thoracic cavity, right?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

A. The lung has been taken out.

Q. In the lower -- below that is the peritoneal cavity?

A. You know, this is -- I have some difficulty with this picture
because this is over simplification of the anatomy for a high school
student.

Q. Well, that's about my level of education.

A. Yeah, but not mine.

Q. Okay.

(Laughter.)

I understand that. You have more degrees than a thermometer, right?

(Laughter.)

Now, in the -- in the retroperitoneal space, and that's the area that
I'm pointing to, back here -- in other words, if you hit somebody in
the kidney, punch -- the kidneys are retroperitoneal?

A. The kidneys are retroperitoneal.

Q. And that space, the retroperitoneal space is relatively dense. You
would agree with that?

I mean it's filled with fat, muscle, kidneys, correct?

There is no, like, cavity, there. It is all solid?

A. Well, it's not -- It contains -- It contains, yes, fat; a little
fat. I mean, Ron Goldman didn't have a lot of fat. It contains loose
tissue. I don't know how to describe --

Q. All your back muscles are back there in the retroperitoneal.

MR. MEDVENE: Excuse me, the witness was answering the question.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) I'm sorry. Go ahead.

A. No, the back muscles that we know as back muscles, those strong
muscles that allow us to lift, those are outside of that. Those are
behind there. The muscles that I showed surrounding the vertebral
column, those were on my diagram.

Q. Let's use your diagram, then. I'll get it for you, sir.

I've got this one.

MR. MEDVENE: There's a front and a back, Bob.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Maybe you better get it. I can't find --

A. Should be this one. This is from the view.

Q. Okay. All right.

A. The other one is a view from the front.

Q. Okay.

Now, the density of the area, the retroperitoneal area is more dense,
that is, in terms of space for blood to accumulate than the peritoneal
cavity, you'd agree with that?

(Indicating.)

A. Could you -- excuse me, but could you say it again?

Q. I'd be happy to.

In terms of, let's just call it space, there is more area for blood to
accumulate if there is blood bleeding in the peritoneal cavity than
there is in the retroperitoneal space. You would agree with that?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay. And would you further agree, sir, that in terms of blood loss
and blood leakage that blood being a fluid, follows the normal fluid
dynamics of any fluid, that is; it will take the path of least
resistance. You would agree with that?

A. Yes.

Q. All right.

Now, the thing that we know about the flank wounds to Mr. Goldman from
the autopsy -- by the way, sir, you did rely upon the autopsy report
and the work of the L.A. County coroner's office in arriving at your
opinion and conclusions in this case, did you not?

(Indicating to boards.)

A. Yes.

Q. As I understand it, you correct me if I'm in error, you did not
view any piece of evidence, would that be true?

A. Well, Yes, I did view evidence. I think the autopsy report is
evidence. I think the photographs are evidence.

Q. Okay.

A. I think that it is evidence that, with everything else I reviewed
to get it such in my mind that I would see totally clear, I also
called Dr. Golden and -- who did the autopsies and talked it over with
me.

Q. When we took your deposition, you hadn't talked to Dr. Golden?

A. No, I didn't. I talked to him afterwards.

Q. I want to talk to you about -- a little bit about, you didn't
review any physical piece of evidence. I mean, you looked at the
reports. You looked at the photographs. But as far as reviewing, for
example, the tissue that you showed us in one of the photographs, you
didn't review that tissue, did you?

A. No. I saw the piece of tissue on the picture and then I spoke to
Golden about it.

Q. Okay. All right.

Now, in terms of the drawing that is on the board, this exploded area
is a little bit inaccurate. Because it shows a space between the aorta
and this would be the lining of the peritoneal cavity or the
peritoneum, correct?

A. Well, it's not -- it's inaccurate and not inaccurate. It's the
peritoneal, as I testified right over the aorta. It dresses the aorta.
It is practically -- it's not adherent, but it lies against it.

Q. And --

A. Right here, there is a small space because I wanted to show how --
(Indicating to drawing showing aorta) -- I want to make it clear that
the arrow goes through -- I thought it was clearer this way.

Q. Fine. Then all I'm trying to get you to agree with me, and I think
you have, is that the peritoneum, that is the lining of the peritoneal
cavity, lies adjacent to the aorta?

A. Yes, it does.

Q. And rests upon it or one or the other?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay. Now.

THE COURT REPORTER: Excuse me. Does this have a number?

MR. MEDVENE: 2025.

Q. In the autopsy property -- property of Mr. Goldman, in the photo
that you showed us, there is a one-half inch measured by Dr. Golden, a
one-half inch entry wound, and a one-half inch exit wound, right?

A. That's correct.

(Indicating to 2025.)

Q. And the opening at the left flank of Mr. Goldman was how big, sir?

A. You mean the wounds in the skin?

Q. Yes, sir.

A. I can't say that I recall. I can't say that I recall, but I'll look
it up.

Q. It's three-quarters of an inch, I believe.

A. I think you may be right.

Q. So -- and the wounds where it perforates the aorta, is
five-and-a-half inches from the entrance wound which is three-quarters
of an inch, true?

A. Yes.

Q. So what we have is we have a knife that is at least five and a half
inches long. We have a knife that has a blade that probably goes at
least a half inch wide and was a half inch wide at the end of the
blade, correct?

A. No.

Q. It had to be a half an inch wide going through the aorta, right?

A. No.

Q. When it went through the aorta, that blade had, of necessity, to go
through the peritoneal lining, did it not?

A. You mean the tip of the blade had to go through the peritoneal; is
that what you're asking me?

Q. The blade entered and put a slice or a rent to use your medical
terms, in the peritoneum at the same, virtually simultaneously with
entering one side of the aorta, coming out the other side of the aorta
and having the peritoneum lining adjacent to it, right?

A. Yes, it did and I testified to that.

Q. Okay.

A. I said that earlier.

Q. Okay.

Now, in terms, sir, of your construction of this being the first
wounds, you were of the view that that was the first wound and that as
you testified, that the whole incident took somewhere around a minute,
right?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, Your Honor. Misstates the evidence. He didn't
say it was the first wounds necessarily, he said the flank wound was
the first wound or the thigh wound, I think.

MR. BAKER: Well --

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) The sequence reading from your deposition page 24,
line 22, of injuries from Goldman, I believe is that the injury to the
posterior abdominal area is either first or very early on?

A. That's correct.

Q. Okay.

Now, if that -- this -- if that was true, when you had the perforation
of the aorta -- Phil, will you put up the circulatory system, if we
can, on the monitor?

(Mr. P. Baker complies.)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) As I understand it, and I agree, you have more
education than I do, the blood, after it leaves the heart, goes on the
arch, comes down the aorta and bifurcates into the femoral arteries,
right?

A. Yes, that's correct.

Q. And the blood pressure in the aorta is at a minimum. The blood
pressure that the human being would have, that is if it was -- if that
human being was frightened and it was up to 200 over 140 at the time
that the heart pumped, the left side of the heart pumped, you would
have 200 milliliters of pressure in the aorta before the knife went
through the aorta, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And if, in fact, the knife went through the aorta, then went
through the other side of the aorta, and went into the peritoneum, you
would have to agree, because you just testified that the density of
the tissue in the retroperitoneal space is greater than the density of
the tissue in the peritoneal cavity, that the first place blood would
go is into the peritoneal cavity, true, sir?

MR. MEDVENE: If the Court please, we object. The question's compound
and it assumes facts. He made a statement.

THE COURT: He's asking an anatomical question. If it's incorrect, the
doctor can tell him it's incorrect.

MR. MEDVENE: All right, your Honor

THE WITNESS: No, sir, I don't think I testified about density of
tissues in the retroperitoneum versus the peritoneum.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) I see.

A. I said that there is loose tissue in the retroperitoneum in the
abdominal cavity. They are --

Q. Is the answer to my question simply no?

MR. MEDVENE: Excuse me. The witness is in the middle.

THE COURT: Finish your answer.

THE WITNESS: In the abdominal cavity, there are all kinds of organs. I
don't know that anybody ever measured the density of the
retroperitoneal content versus the density of the abdominal content.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Just let me ask you to assume hypothetically, sir,
hypothetically, let's just assume that the contents of the
retroperitoneal space are denser than the contents in the peritoneal
cavity. Let's further assume that the rent or cut into the aorta goes
in one side, out the other side into the peritoneal cavity.

You would agree, that if that is true, the blood would go into -- more
blood would go into the peritoneal cavity than would go into the
retroperitoneal space?

A. No. I would definitely not agree to that.

MR. MEDVENE: Objection.

THE WITNESS: Let me just give you an example --

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) No you've answered the question.

A. -- Why, I don't agree with you.

Q. You answered the question.

A. Okay.

Q. If this were the first wound, Mr. Goldman would be incapacitated
within a matter of seconds. You would agree with that?

A. Probably.

Q. Because what happens is, if this is the first wound, you have an
enormous loss of blood in terms of blood recirculating to the heart
and then being pumped up the carotid arteries to put oxygenated blood
to the brain, correct?

A. Well, he would lose consciousness very quickly because the brain
would not get, although it would get blood, but it would not get
enough blood. The brain is very susceptible of oxygen deprivation.

Q. And, Doctor, you're certainly familiar with some people get what
they call positional hypotension; that is, people with low blood
pressure stand up and they start to faint, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And that's because they have not adequate oxygenated blood going to
the brain, true?

A. Presumably.

Q. Well, it's presumably true; isn't it? Okay.

In other words, so Mr. Goldman, upon being inflicted with this right
flank pain -- right flank wound, I'll strike it again.

Left flank wound that goes through the aorta, is going to have an
immediate loss of blood pressure and an immediate -- and by immediate,
I mean within five or ten seconds, he is going to have a -- he's going
to know that something's seriously wrong. He's going to go
semi-conscious and then within ten seconds, he's going to be down on
one knee. And within 15 seconds, he's going to be down. You would
agree with that?

A. No.

Q. Well, let's go through, now, the wounds to the -- if the fatal
wounds -- if the sequence is the wound to the internal jugular vein,
Mr. Goldman would have the ability to fight for a period of time. You
would agree with that?

A. Yes.

Q. And the reason he would have an ability to fight for a period of
time is because, as you suggested earlier, the veins are not under the
same pressure as the arteries, true?

A. Yes.

Q. And, in fact, he could fight for ten or 15 minutes with the
internal jugular vein severed, correct?

A. I don't know if he could fight for ten or 15 minutes with the
internal jugular severed, but he could continue being active and doing
things for some time.

Q. Okay. I don't want to be -- to go as far as to say 15 minutes.

Phil, put up the diagram, please, of the closed-in area at the Bundy
crime scene.

(P. Baker complies, displays diagram.)

Q. Have you seen the photos of the closed-in area, sir?

A. Yes.

Q. And have you seen the -- Thank you.

MR. P. BAKER: That's exhibit 867 on the screen and exhibit 1342 on the
board:

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now --

A. I'm sorry these pictures I have not seen before.

Q. You've never seen these?

A. No.

(Indicating to 1342.)

Q. Were you aware that there was blood smears on the whole of the gate
right at the commencement of the closed-in --

A. Am I aware there are some blood splatters.

All right.

I'm not aware of large volumes Of blood. I'm aware of some blood
splatters and I mean, in terms of quantity that's an insignificant
amount of blood. But in terms of other values, in terms of other
points to -- for the use of these splatters for reconstruction of the
events here for criminalists that I'm not aware of.

Q. Well, so I'm to understand then, Dr. Spitz, that in arriving at
your opinion, that Ron Goldman from the first wounds to him being
incapacitated and in route to death, was one minute or thereabouts,
you never looked at photos in the closed-in area; is that true?

A. Yeah. My testimony is one minute or less.

Q. Okay. Or less?

A. Yes. And that is based on the wounds and not on the area where the
body was found -- the bodies are found other than what I gleaned when
I went to the scene.

Q. Okay. Now, would you be kind enough, sir, to go over and look at
the top two photographs on the right and tell me if you see blood
pooling?

For example, the top photograph on the right, if you see blood pooling
the right, sir?

A. On the right?

(Indicating to top right of exhibit 1342.)

A. I don't see blood pooling. I see some blood here.

Q. Well, right below your pen; is that blood pooling or is it not?

A. This?

Do you mean this?

Q. That's what I mean.

A. I don't know what that is.

Q. Don't know what that is. Okay.

A. I've never seven it before so I cannot tell you.

Q. Do you see the boot that Mr. Goldman had in the lower right hand?

A. Yes.

Q. And you would agree, would you not, sir, that there is blood and
dirt on that boot?

A. Yes. Well, I don't know if it's blood. It looks like it could be
blood.

Q. And you don't have any -- well, strike that.

Do you think that is indicative that there was a significant amount of
blood that was in that closed-in area that got in the dirt, and then
when he was struggling and fighting for his life in the closed-in area
got on his boot?

A. You know, I cannot --

Q. Do you have an opinion at all?

A. If this is blood, I don't know where this blood came from and if
blood could have got on him in the area where Nicole Simpson was.

(Indicating to photo of Ron Goldman's shoe.)

Q. Really? I do know where the area of where Nicole Brown's. One was
an area of tile?

A. There was tile with a lot of blood on it.

Q. There was blood up into the crevice in those boots, is there not,
assuming that is blood?

A. There is blood on the photo of this shoe. That's what -- I don't
know that it is, but if you tell me that it is, then I have to believe
you.

Q. Well, it --

THE COURT: Have you -- you have an estimate as to how long you're
going to be?

MR. BAKER: Going to be a while. I'm going to be a while on Tuesday, I
assume.

THE COURT: Okay. Give me an idea.

MR. BAKER: About two hours.

THE COURT: Ladies and gentlemen, we'll adjourn until Tuesday at 8:30.

Let me remind you not to talk about this case among yourselves.

THE BAILIFF: We are still on the record. The judge is still on the
bench.

(Pause in the proceedings.)

THE COURT: You know, if you can't maintain yourself in the audience,
you are going to be out of here.

(Indicating to audience.)

THE COURT: Ladies and gentlemen, you're not to talk about this case
among yourselves or with anybody else; not to form or express any
opinions about this case; not to watch anything on television, listen
to anything on the radio, read anything in the press. Don't watch any
re-enactments, nothing connected with this case.

Jay Leno has a skit. Don't watch it. Okay?

Everybody understand that.

JURORS: Yes.

THE COURT: It's very important that you comply with it. And if anybody
pressures you about talking about this case or anything like that,
please be sure to let me know.

Okay. Have a nice weekend. We will see you Tuesday morning at 8:30.

JURORS: Thank you.

(At 4:31 P.M. a recess was taken Until Tuesday, October 12, 1996 at
8:30 A.M.)

DEPARTMENT NO. WEQ
HON. HIROSHI FUJISAKI, JUDGE

(REGINA D. CHAVEZ, OFFICIAL REPORTER)

(The following proceedings were held in open court outside the
presence of the jury:)

MR. LEONARD: Morning, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Okay. Somebody has something they want to address?

MR. PETROCELLI: Yes, Your Honor.

With regard to the Court's confidentiality order, we understand that
there was a modification with regard to witnesses on the theory that
the lawyers cannot control witnesses. But we have here, an expert
witness consultant, retained by the defense, paid by the defense, on
television last night commenting specifically about the testimony of a
pending witness who's testimony is not even concluded.

Dr. Baden is the fellow who is was on TV. He's going to be in court
testifying for the defense, talking about Dr. Spitz's testimony in
court. I don't think it's appropriate that witnesses under the control
of a party, retain witnesses who are thereby agents and
representatives of counsel or a party be talking about the
proceedings, specifically the subject matter of their testimony while
this case is pending; and that's why we filed the application.

THE COURT: Well, bearing in mind that the Court addressed the summary
issue with regards to the jury selection expert, I indicated at that
time that the Court did not feel it had personal jurisdiction over
that person. And in this instance, I don't feel that I have personal
jurisdiction over Dr. Baden.

However, as in the case of a jury selection expert, I indicated that
if the defense cannot keep control of their people, the people they
hire, they pay money to, the recourse that's available to the Court is
to not permit them to testify. And that's exactly what's going to
happen if Dr. Baden continues to comport himself in the manner which
he's allegedly comported.

MR. BAKER: Understood, Your Honor. We have one other matter.

THE COURT: All right. In lieu of an Order to Show Causes re: Contempt,
the Court orders that should Dr. Baden or any other any other defense
witness get on television or news media and broadcast anything,
connected with this case, the Court will do -- the defense and the
plaintiff have been forewarned and any witness who prejudices this
trial by making public comment on the media with regards to the
matters that are directly involved in this case, will be precluded
from testifying.

That's going to be my -- That's the way I'm going to handle it. Okay.

MR. BAKER: That witness' under our control, right?

THE COURT: Well, you -- Dr. Baden appears to be your expert witness.

MR. BAKER: He's our expert witness. I agree with that.

THE COURT: You pay him. You have control over him.

MR. BAKER: I don't know that -- adopt the Court's linkage. I
understand the Court's order.

THE COURT: All right. Anything else?

MR. BAKER: Yes.

THE COURT: Yes.

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, during Friday's session, Dr. Spitz indicated at
page 141 that after we took Dr. Spitz' deposition on August 16, he
then had a conversation with Dr. Golden, this is at page 141 of the
daily that I got, volume 12, lines 18 through 21.

And I would move the Court that he not be allowed to discuss anything
relative to that conversation. He certainly had the opportunity to
talk to Dr. Golden between January, when he was retained, and August
16, when we took his deposition and he indicated in his deposition as
well that he hadn't talked to Dr. Golden, the autopsy surgeon under
the case of Kennemer at 233 Cal.App. 3d.

We would request the Court to order him not to discuss or to bring
into his testimony, any of the information gleaned from that
conversation because we obviously didn't have an opportunity to
cross-examine him about that and go back to Dr. Golden about that
conversation, and I think that would be sandbagging us in this case
and I don't think it's appropriate and the Kenner case so holds."

MR. MEDVENE: If the Court please, Dr. Spitz did not indicate it was
the basis for his opinion and further what he said was in response to
a question from the defense. He has no intent to raise that.

THE COURT: Excuse me?

MR. MEDVENE: Unless the defense raises it.

THE COURT: What was the question?

MR. MEDVENE: My memory of the question.

THE COURT: Mr. Baker, you have the transcript right there.

MR. BAKER: Question (Reading:)

"As I understand it, you correct me if I'm in error, you did not view
any piece of evidence, would that be true.

"A. Well, Yes. I did view evidence. I think the autopsy report is
evidence. I think the photographs are evidence.

"Q. Okay. I think that the -- that --

"A. I think that it is evidence that, with everything else, are viewed
to get it, such in my mind that I would see totally clear. I also
called Dr. Golden, who did the autopsy and talked it over with me."

Q. When you took your deposition, you hadn't talked to Dr. Golden.

A. No I talked to him afterwards.

THE COURT: Okay.

The witness is ordered to the -- not order -- not to refer to any
conversation that you had with Dr. Golden.

THE WITNESS: Yes, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Okay. Thank you. Okay. Bring the jury in.

(The following proceedings were held in open court in the presence of
the jury:)

(Jurors resume their respective seats.)

THE COURT: Good morning.

JURORS: Morning, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Okay. You may proceed.

THE CLERK: You are still under oath. Would you state your name again
for the record?

THE WITNESS: Werner Spitz.

WERNER SPITZ, having been previously called and sworn as a witness by
the Plaintiffs, testified further as follows:

CROSS-EXAMINATION (CONTINUED) BY MR. BAKER:

Q. Morning Dr. Spitz.

A. Morning.

Q. Did you enjoy our southern California weekend weather over the
weekend?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Now, would it be -- would it be accurate, sir, for the first time
since you've been involved in this case, that being from the criminal
trial to this last weekend, you finally took some notes relative to
this case?

A. Well, Yes, I did. That's correct. I did make some notes over the
weekend to refresh my memory on certain points and to -- and you know,
it is really my habit to make notes. I didn't make notes before, for
some unknown reason. I don't know why there was so much overwhelming
material that I didn't make notes, but ....

Q. Let me ask you, Doctor, you were consulted by the prosecution
during the criminal case, were you not, sir?

A. No. I was consulted. I was called by the prosecution during the
criminal case to request permission to use pictures from my book.

Q. Now, throughout the criminal case, throughout your retention in
this case, in a complex matter, you say where there's so much
information, you never took a note until this weekend; is that
correct?

A. Yes.

Q. All right. Now, let me ask you in terms of your review in arriving
at your opinions, you read and reviewed the autopsy reports in some
detail, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And is there anything that you disagree within the autopsy report?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Compound.

MR. BAKER: Either one.

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Compound, Your Honor and it's vague and
ambiguous. The autopsy reports are 30 or more pages.

THE COURT: You may answer yes or no as a preliminary hearing answer.

THE WITNESS: No, I don't disagree with anything that's in the autopsy
report.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) The autopsy reports, as your counsel for plaintiffs
just mentioned, are 20, 25 pages; are they not?

A. Whatever they are.

Q. Your usual autopsy report is a page or two; is it not?

A. Yes.

Q. So these have somewhat more detail than your customary autopsy
report, you would agree, correct?

A. Possibly. I'm not even sure of that. I know that 25 pages as
appeared to one and a half or two pages sounds a bit different.

Q. Sounds a lot different?

A. Of course, but your including in the 25, 20 or 25 pages, I think
you said diagrams and results of toxicological analyses and
investigative reporting. I don't include all that. Mine is a -- my
reports are single space densely typed. And when they are two pages
like this, they -- I mean, you could extend that into easily six,
seven pages if you typed it a little differently.

Q. Now, in Ron Goldman's report, there's 18 pages of single space,
typed written report, then 6 pages of addendum for 24 pages before the
forms or diagrams are even shown. You would agree with that, correct?

A. Yes. And you would also agree, Dr. Spitz, that when an autopsy
surgeon pathologist is reporting, they put in their reports in the
anatomical summary on page 1, in the order of importance, their
findings. You would agree with that, true?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Calls for conclusion, Your Honor.

THE COURT: You may ask whether or not that is the case in this
instance.

MR. MEDVENE: If the Court, please, he may be -- he's opening an area
that we discussed, which is fine with us, if he knows.

THE COURT: I don't know what your talking about.

MR. MEDVENE: I didn't want to make a speaking objection. Can we
approach, Your Honor?

THE COURT: You may.

(The following proceedings were held at the bench:)

MR. MEDVENE: Mr. Baker, what the autopsy report says, the autopsy
report makes reference to the aorta wound.

THE COURT: To what?

MR. MEDVENE: The wound to the aorta and the blood flow.

What the question is: Doesn't the autopsy report indicate certain
findings and isn't that, in your experience, what the autopsy surgeon
found?

This witness knows more on what the autopsy surgeon found 'cause he
actually spoke to them this morning.

Your Honor ruled in a vacuum that he could not make reference to the
conversations with Dr. Golden. It would be unfair to ask this witness
what doesn't the autopsy surgeon indicate, X, when the witness knows
from conversations with the autopsy surgeon the significance of what
he wrote and why he wrote what he wrote.

And what I'm saying is I think Mr. Baker's opening the area, which is
fine, but the witness ought to be able to answer within -- if it's
within Mr. Baker's question, what he learned from the autopsy surgeon
as it's pertinent to Mr. Baker's question.

In other words, the autopsy report says certain things. Dr. Spitz
interprets them certain ways and formed certain conclusions. He then
spoke to the autopsy surgeon who confirmed, as I understand it, Dr.
Spitz conclusions.

What Mr. Baker I think is trying to elicit is the autopsy report
doesn't say everything that Dr. Spitz is saying, and isn't it true
that the autopsy surgeon, in affect, doesn't believe what Dr. Spitz is
saying, which is untrue; based on Dr. Spitz's conversation with the
autopsy surgeon.

So what I'm saying is we think Mr. Baker has opened up the area of Dr.
Spitz conversation with Dr. Golden.

MR. BAKER: I don't understand what he's talking about. In an autopsy
report, in the anatomical summary, every -- and the autopsy report
list the most important first. That's what I'm talking about. I'm not
talking about any conversation he had with Golden whatsoever.

THE COURT: Well, as I said before, you can ask him about this
particular autopsy report. We haven't established that there's a
national uniform autopsy protocol.

MR. BAKER: That's what I'm trying to do.

THE COURT: But I don't want to get into the protocol autopsy.

MR. BAKER: We're not -- the purpose of this is that No. 1 on the list,
in the anatomical summary and then is in virtually every autopsy, is
the primary cause of death, this and this one. It's the severance of
the internal jugular vein for Ron Goldman. There's some evidence
because that -- because of the order and that's all I'm going -- then
I'm moving on.

MR. MEDVENE: We think the witness --

THE COURT: I don't think you've opened up to any avenue to Dr. Golden.
If there's something that's contradicted in the autopsy report, maybe
you might consider Dr. Golden as a rebuttal witness. But at this
point, I don't see how I can permit this witness from testifying as to
his conversations about Doctor -- with Dr. Golden after his
deposition.

MR. MEDVENE: But if what he's trying to elicit is that Dr. Golden felt
that the aorta wound had no significance and there was no bleeding,
that's not accurate.

THE COURT: He's trying to establish that the autopsy report says what
it says in the order in which it says.

MR. MEDVENE: There's no problem with that. But he's asking, as a
background question, doesn't the person writing the report -- wouldn't
ordinarily do A, B, and C.

THE COURT: Yeah, so.

MR. MEDVENE: Okay.

THE COURT: You can't rehabilitate his opinion on the autopsy report
from a conversation that was had after the deposition.

MR. MEDVENE: All right, Your Honor.

(The following proceeding were resumed in open court in the presence
of the jury:)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, as we were saying, Dr. Spitz, on the anatomical
summary, if we look at Nicole Brown Simpson, the first indication of
cause of death is a transection of left and right common carotid
arteries, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And you would agree that that is the primary cause of death in
Nicole Brown Simpson, true?

A. Yes.

Q. And if we look at Ronald Goldman, the primary cause of death
listed, No. 1, sharp force wound of neck, left side with transection
of left internal jugular vein and that was listed first in the Ron
Goldman autopsy report, correct?

A. Well, I suppose it's listed as No. 1.

Q. All right. And did it -- is it correct, the custom and practice of
autopsy surgeons in listing in the anatomical summary, the cause of
death is that the primary cause of death is listed first, true?

A. No.

Q. Okay. Now, in terms --

A. May I explain?

Q. You'll have plenty of time, sir.

Now, in terms of your full reconstruction of the murders of June 12,
1994, and you did do a full reconstruction, in your own mind, did you
not, sir?

A. Of what?

Q. Of how the murders took place?

A. I did a reconstruction, a full reconstruction, as you call it, in
my area of expertise.

Q. Let me read what you --

A. I mean, if I did not do a full reconstruction in encompassing other
disciplines. I'm a forensic pathologist. I did a full reconstruction
from my angle?

Q. Let me read what you told us on Friday afternoon on page 126 of
volume 11 of your testimony on Friday. Starting at line 14 (Reading:)

" ... You did a full reconstruction of how these murders took place in
your mind, and you're willing to sit here and tell us about them?

"A. Yes."

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, you didn't qualify anything about your area of
expertise when we asked you the question about full reconstruction,
true?

A. I don't know that that's true because I don't know what comes in
the sentences before and what comes in the sentences after.

If the question is fingerprint analysis or shoe print analysis or hair
and fibers or DNA, I'm no expert in those -- in those areas. It goes
without saying. There's a lot of things people say when they talk that
isn't qualified. But it is certainly evident that I'm not an expert in
areas in which I haven't had training.

Q. Now, have you had training, sir, in how assailants inflict knife
wounds on human beings?

A. Yes. In that area, I think I have had training.

Q. And you've had training, I take it, sir, then in timing of the
infliction of wounds and reviewing a murder scene, to determine
whether or not the estimate -- Strike that.

Whether or not your time periods would fit within the parameters of
what actually occurred at the time the murder took place, true?

A. No. The main reason why I --

Q. Can you answer my question, sir?

Can I ask the Court to --

A. No. That's not the only reason why I go to a crime scene.

Q. Didn't ask you whether it was the only reason you go to a crime
scene, sir. I said, have you had training where you attempt to
assimilate all of the information of the crime scene to determine
whether or not these estimates or -- strike that.

Not these estimate, these absolute timeframes you gave this jury were,
in fact, accurate when pragmatically compared to what occurred at the
crime scene. You had training in that, sir?

A. I wish I could answer you. I did not understand your question.

Q. Well, in other words, sir, you gave this jury, on direct
examination Friday morning, some pretty concrete timeframes within
which all of these wounds were inflicted to these two human beings,
true?

A. Yes.

Q. And my question to you, sir, is: Have you had any training in
looking at all of the elements of a crime scene, so that these
absolute timeframes that you gave this jury on Friday can be compared
to the crime scene and what actually occurred to determine whether or
not your time periods are, in fact, accurate in --

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, Your Honor. Assumes facts not in evidence that
you have to go to the crime scene.

THE COURT: Okay. Sustained. That's a multifaceted compound question
that is starting off on one track and ending on another.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Well, let me ask you this question in terms of the
injuries. We were talking about Ron Goldman on Friday in doing the
accident, the -- not the accident, the reconstruction of the crime
scene, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And you -- I -- you have not seen any of the photos that were of
the closed-in area, correct?

A. I had not seen these pictures. I'd seen other pictures of the same
areas but these pictures, I had not seen. The other pictures, I would
say, show the same area. But these very pictures, I have not seen.

Q. Okay. Now, I showed you a picture in the upper right-hand corner,
and -- on Friday and you couldn't tell us whether or not you thought
that that was blood 'cause you just didn't know, correct?

The upper right-hand corner -- what's that chart number, please, Phil.

MR. P. BAKER: 1342.

MR. BAKER: 1342?

THE WITNESS: May we -- may I approach the board?

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Well, I put that, Monday, on the monitor, put a
close-up picture of that on the monitor and you can tell us whether
you believe that this is, in fact, blood of Mr. Goldman?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Relevance, outside the scope of the direct,
"what's on the fence."

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Can you see that, sir?

A. Yes.

Q. What number is it?

MR. P. BAKER: Going to mark that next in order. Sorry.

THE CLERK: 2166.

(The instrument herein referred to as Photo on Exhibit board 1342
showing blood stains on bar was marked for identification as
Defendants' Exhibit No. 1342.)

Q. Is that a close-up of the photo the upper right-hand photo of the
board 1342, sir?

A. I'd have to go and look at it.

Q. Go ahead.

A. Yes.

Q. And would you now agree, sir, that that was, in fact, blood?

A. You're talking about this area here?

Q. Talking about on the lower horizontal bar of the fence.

A. This?

(Pointing to photo on board.)

Q. Correct?

A. Yes.

Q. I'm talking about dripping down off of that horizontal bar into the
dirt area in front of the concrete stone, whatever it is?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay. And you would agree that's blood, correct?

A. I would agree that that looks like blood, yes.

Q. All right. And for a person to have bled in that particular manner,
the person has to be above it, correct?

Bled down on that horizontal bar, true?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Lack of foundation, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: I --

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You can answer.

A. It looks to me --

Q. Can you answer my question. I didn't ask --

MR. MEDVENE: If the Court please --

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) I didn't ask what it looks like to you.

A. I'm not a blood splatter expert.

Q. Would you agree that the person who left the blood there, had to be
above the area where the blood is dropped on the horizontal rail of
the fence and then puddles into the dirt area.

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Asked and answered. The witness said he's not
a blood splatter expert and he wasn't put on for that purpose.

THE COURT: You can answer yes or no. He testified in direct
examination with regards to blood flow.

THE WITNESS: The origin of this blood could be from a higher level. It
could be from the same level.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) It's going to take some period of time for that
blood to accumulate on the horizontal bar as well as to accumulate in
the puddle areas that are about -- in the center of the TV monitor.
You would agree with that?

A. You mean that it takes time for this blood to accumulate here?

Q. Yes, sir. That's what I mean.

A. Everything takes time. There's nothing in life that doesn't take
time. The question is: How much time, but it takes time. It takes
time. Everything we do takes time.

Q. Now, if you would come over, I want to point out on 1342, the
middle picture on the left-hand side and ask you if you have looked at
that area where there is a hole that is approximately 12 inches by 12
inches, maybe 8 to 10 inches deep?

A. Yes. There is a hole.

Q. And I want you to further assume that Detective Lange came into
this courtroom and said that hole, more likely or not, in his opinion,
was made during the struggle that culminated in the death of Ron
Goldman. Now --

A. He said that this hole was made during the struggle.

Q. That's what he said.

A. Okay.

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Assumes facts not in evidence.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, do you have an opinion as to whether or not you
can dig that hole, and you can have the blood that is indicated on the
TV monitor, now, would that take over five seconds?

A. I don't know how big the hole is. I don't know. I'm not an expert
in hole digging. I don't base an opinion on the hole digging. I have
really no opinion about whether that hole existed -- preexisted,
existed or was done after the fact. I have never seen the hole. I
don't know what it is.

Q. Well, but you never took that into account in asking, for your
opinion and conclusion, that within 60 seconds, the first wound was
inflicted on Ron Goldman and until the last wound was inflicted on Ron
Goldman, correct?

A. My opinion is --

Q. Did you take --

A. Has been --

Q. Did you take it into consideration, was the question, Doctor, not
what your opinion is.

THE COURT: Did you take that into consideration, the hole?

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) The hole and the blood splatters and the -- that are
on the photo on the monitor, did you take those, just those two
elements into consideration in arriving at your opinions and
conclusion that it was 60 seconds from the first wound to the last on
Ron Goldman?

A. Can I answer, Your Honor?

Q. You may.

THE COURT: You may.

THE WITNESS: I took into consideration, the blood that I saw. I did
not take into consideration the hole.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Well, you didn't take into consideration the blood
you saw on the horizontal bar of the fence, on the north end of the
caged-in area because you didn't know it was blood on Friday; isn't
that true?

A. I took into consideration everything that I thought was blood in
the -- in that general area.

Q. What's the number of this one?

MR. P. BAKER: 2134.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) On 2134, do you know where this blood came from?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, Your Honor. No testimony about the back gate
and the case --

THE COURT: This --

MR. BAKER: This is not the back gate, Mr. Medvene.

THE WITNESS: Who's blood is this?

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Do you know where it is in terms of taking into
consideration, your opinions that it took 60 seconds from the first to
the last wound on Ron Goldman?

A. These blood splatters were taken into consideration, although at
this moment, I cannot tell you where this is. I looked at the scene. I
looked at other pictures of the scene. I got a very excellent idea of
what the scene looked like. I went to the scene a couple of times and
I studied the scene.

My opinion in regards to the length, to the duration of the
altercation with both individuals has not changed one iota and will
not change unless there is new evidence that comes in.

Q. I'm sure of that.

Now --

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. We object and move to strike Mr. Baker's last
remark.

THE COURT: Last remark stricken. Jurors to disregard it.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) On -- put up the diagram, Phil, of the closed-in
area, please.

(Mr. P Baker complies.)

Q. No. Back off a little bit.

(Indicating to monitor.)

Q. Is your gate open or close at the time the altercation took place;
that is the front gate?

A. I believe that the gate was possibly open.

Q. And --

A. But there's no lock.

Q. Where was the first wound? Where was Mr. Goldman standing when the
first wound was inflicted on Mr. Goldman?

A. I think Mr. Goldman was probably in the area, in the general area
in which he was eventually found dead.

Q. Now, where was Nicole Brown Simpson standing when the first wound
was inflicted upon her?

(Indicating to diagram with yellow figures and red footprints.)

Q. Where she's at the time she sustained her first injuries?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. Also in the general area in which she was found, the picture I just
showed you, was a picture of the front gate which you believe was
open.

Now, does that indicate to you that there was blood spatter from Mr.
Goldman, who was standing near the front gate at the time the first
wound was inflicted upon him, rather than over in the dirt area or the
closed-in area.

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, Your Honor. Assumes facts not in evidence in
testimony of exactly where he was standing. He didn't say he was
standing where Mr. Baker said he was standing.

THE COURT: Overruled. But I'll sustain the objection because this
witness didn't say the gate was open. He made a reference to the gate
being either open or unlocked.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Did you not indicate that you thought the gate was
open at time?

A. I said the gate was opened but qualified it by saying unlocked. I
didn't say that the gate was ajar. You didn't ask me that.

Q. Did you believe that Mr. Goldman was standing on a tile walkway at
the time the first wound was inflicted?

A. He may have. The area is so small. It is six by four feet, so if
you'd like me to show you what six by four feet is, I'd be glad to do
that, if somebody has a tape measure.

Q. The area is actually nine by four feet, when you put the tile area
in it as well; isn't that true, sir?

A. I'm talking about the area of altercation with Mr. Goldman. I'm not
talking about the area, the areas that are adjacent. I'm talking about
the area of the -- area in which Mr. Goldman met his -- met his death.

Q. Okay. So that we're clear, the reason we're not --

A. Let me just show you what --

Q. Let me you ask you a question so that we're clear. The reason that
we're concentrating on the area of six feet by four feet, is it's your
view that Mr. Goldman did not incur any wound while he was on the tile
area, only while he was on the tile area which is six feet by four
feet, true?

A. Yes.

Q. All right.

A. Yes. Let me just say that I am not certain whether he was standing
near the tile or off to one side of the tile or to the other. But the
area, where he incurred his injuries is the six by four feet.

Q. All right. And that's -- all his wound were incurred in there,
right?

(Witness indicates with measuring tape.)

A. This would be four feet.

Q. Okay. Can you hold this for me?

(Mr. Medvene complies.)

A. This would be six feet.

Q. Okay.

A. So, in other words, the area in question is this area here, a
little less than this area here because it only goes to here. This is
--

Q. If we have the tiled area, that's another three feet right, this
way?

A. You go -- you mean over this way?

Q. Right.

A. Whatever it is, yes.

(Indicating to diagram.)

Q. Then three the six feet dimension is what I'm trying to get at. The
six feet dimension you're talking about, is from the walkway to the
fence on the north side, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Um, and four feet is from the east side fence to the area where the
tree is, correct?

A. Yes. This is on the Bundy side.

Q. Yes. The east side. All right.

In terms of your analysis, Mr. Goldman and Nicole Brown Simpson, never
came into contact with each other, correct, met?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Vague, ambiguous "came into contact."

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) They never had physical contact with each other at
any time during the murder scenario, true?

A. Who didn't?

Q. The two victims.

A. Once the altercation started or once the -- The injuries started --

Q. Okay. They did not have contact with each other?

A. Once the injuries started, no, I don't believe that they
necessarily had contact.

Q. Well, not necessarily. Is it your belief that they did not, sir?

A. I believe that -- I believe this, from my understanding, the way I
understand the scene, but I am not the one and only in this case
giving opinions.

So from my angle, from the way I see it, based on injury and injury
pattern and understanding of the scene from my angle, that's my
opinion.

Q. All right. Now, that's -- you read Dr. Lakshmanan testimony in the
criminal trial, in preparation for your testimony before your
deposition on August 16, 1996, correct?

A. Yes. And you disagree with Dr. Lakshmanan in a couple major areas,
do you not, sir?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, Your Honor. It's not relevant. It also
misstates the record. Also compound.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. BAKER: On which ground, sir.

THE COURT: Dr. Lakshmanan has not testified in this case and
apparently is not going to.

MR. BAKER: I don't know about that.

MR. MEDVENE: Excuse me. We'd ask Mr. Baker's remark be stricken.

THE COURT: Stricken.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) In any event, sir, you read and reviewed his
testimony so that you would have some semblance of what his thoughts
were, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And, well, let me ask you to go back just a minute. Did you -- did
you believe that any of the wounds to Mr. Goldman were, could be
classified as a taunting wound?

A. As what?

Q. Taunting.

A. No.

There are no taunting wounds. Taunting mean, torture-like wound, if
that's what you mean.

Q. Yeah.

A. No. There are no torture wounds.

Q. Let me go back a minute.

You believe that the wound to the left side of Nicole Brown Simpson's
neck, those were all wounds that were made in anticipation or in
attempts, rather, to make the fatal wound that was ultimately made,
correct?

The slashing wound from left to right that cut both carotid arteries?

A. Yes. Those wounds on the left side of her neck, the four stab
wounds, the slash across the neck, the stab wound on the head were all
done in an effort to kill her.

Q. And -- but my question, I hope, was a little more specific than
that. That the wound, the four wounds to the left side of the neck
that are under the left ear, you testified, I believe, Friday were all
made after Nicole Brown Simpson was being held -- and do you need a
picture, Doctor?

A. I would like to see the picture because I would like to know what
you're talking about.

Q. Well, let me just ask you a question, sir first. You can look at
anything you want.

A. Yes.

Q. Did you not testify on Friday that the wounds that were made to
Nicole Brown Simpson, under her left ear were made while she was in a
position with the assailant, left arm around her stretched back and
the wounds were made like with four stabbing wounds and then a slash
across her neck from left to right. That's what you testified to; was
it not, sir?

A. Yes. I testified -- let me tell you what I testified to.

Q. Can you just answer that yes or no.

MR. MEDVENE: Excuse me, your honor, he's trying to answer the
question.

THE COURT: Answer; yes. You may -- he answered yes. You may ask
another question.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now is it your view then, that the assailant that
had one knife that was single, single sharp-sided knife that made all
five of those wounds in very rapid succession, the four underneath the
left ear and the slash that ultimately severed the carotid?

A. It is my opinion that all the wounds were inflicted with a knife,
consistent or compatible with a single-edged sharp knife.

Q. Didn't ask you that question. Maybe it was a poor one, I apologize.

Is it your testimony that those four wounds underneath the left ear
were made with this compatible single-edge knife and they were a
precursor, they were made all in rapid succession just prior to the
lashing wounds from left to right across Ms. Brown Simpson's neck that
turned out to be fatal?

A. You mean all five wounds?

Q. Yes, sir.

A. Yes.

Q. Now, the one directly under Ms. Nicole Brown Simpson's ear has --
the blunt part of that wound is vertical and towards the ear lobe,
true?

A. No.

Q. Did you look at the diagrams drawn by doctor --

A. I've -- I have looked at the diagram. If you like me to I'll be
glad to explain to you why I'm saying, no.

Q. Your view of the photographs, you believe, is better evidence of
the angle of the cuts than the diagram of the autopsy surgeon who made
the diagram, correct?

A. Please, let me explain to you why I'm saying that.

Q. Can you answer my question for a change?

A. No. I'm not. I'm not in agreement with you because what you're
doing is misleading.

MR. MEDVENE: If the Court --

THE WITNESS: I would like the opportunity, sir.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) No. No, have you --

MR. MEDVENE: If the Court please, there's no need for Mr. Baker to
behave like this.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) He's here to answer questions. He's not here to give
a speech.

MR. MEDVENE: There's no reason for Mr. Baker to talk like this or
behave like this, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Ask your question.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Your view then, Dr. Spitz, is that you're looking at
-- a photograph is more reliable than the drawing made by the autopsy
surgeon at the time he did the autopsy, correct?

A. My view is that I need to explain it.

THE COURT: You can agree or disagree, Doctor.

THE WITNESS: Your Honor, it's misleading for me to give a definitive
opinion on somebody's observation of a wound when I know full well
what the relevance is and it's not coming out.

THE COURT: Excuse me. You will answer the question that's asked.

THE WITNESS: I will, Your Honor, of course.

THE COURT: Answer yes or no or you can't answer the question.

THE WITNESS: Well I can't answer the question without qualifying it.

THE COURT: All right. Move on to the next question.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, in your -- in your view of reconstruction of
this, Mr. Goldman was -- Was in the caged-in area at the time this 15
second attack took place on Nicole Brown Simpson, right?

A. Yes.

Q. And, is it your view, based upon your reconstruction of this, that
he just stood there during that period of time?

He didn't run, he didn't yell, he didn't do anything? He just stood
there for the 15 seconds while Ms. Nicole Brown Simpson was being
attacked?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Assumes a fact not in evidence that Ronald
Goldman was there at the time her throat was slashed and it's outside
the scope.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You just indicated that your opinion was that Mr.
Goldman was present during the time that Nicole Brown Simpson was
attacked and murdered; isn't that true?

MR. MEDVENE: Court please, that misstates the evidence.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Did you not -- well, let me get it.

Page 131. This is your testimony from Friday (reading):

"... And then it was your opinion and your reconstruction that you had
done, in your mind, sir, that Mr. Goldman was in the closed-in area
during that 15 second altercation.

"A. I think it possibly was."

Is that your testimony, sir?

A. Yeah. Yes, my testimony that he was either there for that time or
for part of the time, I don't know if he was there for all of the 15
seconds. I have my thoughts that he was there for the entire duration.
And besides, I don't know that the altercation with Ms. Brown took 15
seconds. I always said 15 seconds or less.

Q. And during this 15 seconds or less, when Mr. Goldman probably was
in the -- in the area, did he attack the attacker in your
reconstruction of the event, sir?

A. He may have.

Q. And if he attacked the attacker, most certainly the assailant would
have had some bruises, correct?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Calls for conclusion.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Well, if he attacked the assailant, in your
scenario, sir, the assailant -- if Mr. Goldman came in through the
gate, the assailant had his back to Mr. Goldman while he's at the
initial stages of the attack, true?

A. I don't know whether he had his back or whether he didn't have his
back.

Q. Well, did you -- Was it your view of the event that Nicole Brown
Simpson was the person who took off the glove of Mr. -- of the
assailant?

A. I don't know who took off the glove. I know the glove came off, but
I don't know who took it off.

Q. Well, where did all of these fingernail gouges come from, did they
come from Nicole Brown Simpson or did they come from Ron Goldman or
did they come from somebody else?

A. You mean the fingernail marks that we were talking about on Friday?

Q. Sir, you have testified that every mark on the pictures of Mr.
Simpson's was, in your view, made by a fingernail?

A. Oh, I understand.

Q. You testified to that right. Every one?

A. Yes. May I have -- may I have the pictures back?

Q. May I conduct this examination?

A. Of course.

Q. Thank you.

Now, you testified that every one of those marks on his hands was, in
fact, a fingernail gouge mark, correct?

A. Now, when you say gouge, you're using the wrong term. If I'm to
qualify the fingernail marks, they are fingernail marks of three
different types. They are gouges, too. But they are not all gouges.

Q. Okay. But in any event, sir, those fingernail marks are not going
to be made from somebody wearing a glove. You would agree with that?

A. Yes. All right.

Q. And you would agree that --

A. Yes, that's correct. I'm sorry.

Q. Now, I take it that in doing your careful analysis, you noted that
and went down and reviewed the fingernail clippings of Ron Goldman at
the County Coroner's Office, County of Los Angeles, true?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You did --

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Assumes a fact not in evidence.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) I agree.

You didn't look at any fingernail clippings of Ron Goldman to
determine whether or not he even had fingernails that could have
produced any gouge marks on Mr. Simpson, did you?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, Your Honor. Assumes a fact not in evidence,
that there were fingernail clippings taken.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. MEDVENE: Mr. Baker knows there weren't.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Did you attempt to find out the length of Mr.
Goldman's fingernails to the -- to determine whether or not he could
have made any gouge marks in Mr. Simpson's or any other assailant?

A. Yes.

Q. And did you find that his fingernails were of inappropriate length
to make any gouge marks in Mr. Simpson's?

A. No, I did not find that. May I explain?

I will be glad to explain that to you.

Q. Go ahead.

A. Thank you.

Q. No. No, just sit right there and explain to us, will you?

A. Mr. Goldman had short fingernails. I have short fingernails.

My fingernails are approximately those of Mr. Goldman's. Would you
like me to show you how this works?

Q. Sure. Gouge me.

(Laughter.)

A. You may be sorry.

Q. Go ahead.

A. Well, take your sleeve up.

Q. No. Go ahead. Do it right on my hands where Mr. Simpson's (sic)
hands were. Go ahead.

A. You want me to scoop?

You want me to scoop, tear you out?

Q. I want you to scoop, tear it out.

(Laughter.)

THE COURT: Mr. Baker, I'm not going to have any gouging of flesh out
in my courtroom.

(Laughter.)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) I'm willing to see if he can do it.

A. I wasn't going to do it, but what I would like to indicate to you,
and I'll show you. I can show it to you on me rather than on you
because I know when it hurts and when to stop. On you, I don't know
when it hurts.

So therefore, let me say what happens. When you fight for your life
and you dig in deep, without concern of whether it hurts or didn't
hurt, you push back the top of the flesh of the fingers and the
fingernail suddenly becomes much longer. Now. Having said that, if you
want to, I'll show you what I mean.

(Witness removes jacket and lifts up shirt sleeve.)

I'm not going to gouge, and you're not going to see blood. You're
going to see the indentation. (Witness demonstrates on his own arm.)

THE WITNESS: Can -- you like to see them?

MR. MEDVENE: May the record show that there are indentations on Dr.
Spitz's left arm?

THE WITNESS: I'll be glad to.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) May Dr. Spitz show that to the jury, Your Honor?

THE COURT: I think he's made his point. Go on and ask another
question.

MR. MEDVENE: Yes, sir. Thank you.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, Dr. Spitz, then is it your opinion that the --
that the --

A. Go ahead. I'm sorry.

Q. The fingernail gouge marks are made by Ron Goldman. Is that your
opinion or do you have an opinion as to who they were made by?

A. I'm not able to look at the fingernail marks and say who made them,
obviously. I can say that Mr. Goldman could have made them, Nicole
Brown could have made them.

Q. Well, let's talk about her fingernails for a minute.

What about her fingernails?

Did you examine anything that indicated what type of fingernails she
had on the night of the murder?

A. I understand that she had, what they call --

Q. Fake?

A. Fake fingernails.

Q. Resin fingernails, right?

A. I don't know.

Q. They're included on --

A. I don't know what you call them. There's a name for this, I know,
but I don't know the name.

Q. Well --

A. They're included on --

Q. You would at least agree that the only genetic marker that was
found under any fingernails of either victim was a genetic marker
inconsistent with Mr. Simpson's, true?

A. No, I -- I cannot really answer this with yes or no because there
are -- there is no analysis ever made of Mr. Goldman's fingernails.
There is a record in the report in the autopsy report --

Q. Dr. Spitz, we can't --

A. -- Which says that --

Q. -- We can't talk about evidence that wasn't processed. We don't
know what it is; isn't that true?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Vague, ambiguous, calls for conclusion. I
don't know what it means.

MR. BAKER: I'll withdraw the question.

The only genetic marker that was found under any nails was a genetic
marker inconsistent with Mr. Simpson's, true or untrue?

A. I cannot comment on that.

Q. Well, you commented on it on Friday, did you not?

A. I said no on Friday. And I'm sorry, I did that because it's a
misleading answer.

Q. So you want to change that answer today?

A. I want to say.

Q. Do you want to change the answer? I didn't ask you what you wanted
to say. I asked you if you wanted to change the answer.

A. Yes. I want to change the answer from --

Q. All right. From -- it is not the only genetic marker to what?

A. Well, Goldman is excluded, to begin with, because his wasn't even
taken for analysis.

Q. Is that the change you want to make?

A. The other change I want to make is that it really doesn't concern
me whether there is anything under the fingernails or not and I'll
elaborate on that in a minute if you let me.

And I -- To indicate to you that when the fingernails of Ms. Brown
were examined, there was a red substance on them, which was believed
to be blood.

Q. And there is no typing of blood to match Mr. Simpson from Nicole
Brown Simpson's fingernails, true or untrue?

A. I --

Q. True or untrue, sir?

A. No. This isn't true and it isn't untrue either because --

Q. Thank you. You've answered the question then if that's what you --
Now, I want to ask you, sir, from the front gate around item No. 119,
you can tell that there's this metal meshing here that a -- that's a
gate?

A. Yes.

Q. There was blood on the front gate. I showed you that picture which
had the label of item No. 116 on it a few minutes ago. You want to see
that again?

(Indicating to upper left-hand photo in Exhibit 1342.)

A. Yes, I understand that.

Q. That is down below here?

A. Yes.

Q. So we had blood on the front gate, that would appear from these
photographs, at least, when we were taken to be in an open position,
correct?

A. Yes.

Q. We had, as we go around the area to the east side where Bundy is,
out on the east side, we had more blood smears. We then have a hole in
the northeast corner, correct?

(Indicating to middle photo.)

A. There's a hole on the picture.

Q. We have keys that were dropped in the area or discarded or flung or
whatever?

A. You mean, within the four to -- four to six feet?

Q. Yes. At the feet of Mr. Goldman, do we not?

(Indicating to diagram with yellow figures and red footprints.)

Q. Do we?

A. Yes.

Q. We have a pager that has been dropped or flung in the area behind
the fence on the north side, actually onto the adjacent property,
correct?

(Indicating to diagram.)

A. Behind Mr. Goldman's body.

Q. Correct.

A. In that you mean in that little space here or under the fence,
there's a little level under the fence that you see over there on that
picture where the pager may have been found.

Q. Well, here's the pager right here?

A. Yes. That's right --

(Indicating to 1342, left hand photo.)

Q. It's indicated in this diagram. I think that's a photograph exhibit
outside the fence. I think that's supposed to be a symbolic depiction
thereof.

And then we had Mr. Goldman lying on the right side, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And that indicated to you that there was a struggle that took place
in that closed-in area that you measured off, four feet by six feet,
correct?

A. Yes.

Q. It also indicated to you that struggle consumed some period of
time, did it not?

A. As I indicated already, everything in life takes time.

Q. And --

A. And, it was my opinion that this struggle took place in less than a
minute.

Q. And actually, would you agree or disagree that a forensic
pathologist can only indicate the minimum time it takes to inflict
wounds, but it can never indicate the maximum time?

A. I don't necessarily agree with that. You can indicate what you
believe is a reasonable estimate for a minimum time and you can
indicate what, within reason, may be the range of something taking.

And it is because of that, that I said that the injuries to Mr.
Goldman took a minute and maybe less and the injuries to Ms. Simpson,
Ms. Brown took 15 seconds or less.

Q. And --

A. 15 seconds is a maximum time and a minute for Mr. Goldman is a
maximum time. So I beg to disagree with you there.

Q. Okay. So in your view, based upon the wounds itself, you can
extrapolate that regardless of whether a hole was dug, regardless of
whether keys were flung, regardless of whether an envelope is between
the two victims, regardless of whether a pager is flung, regardless of
whether Mr. Goldman had a bruise on his hand, that regardless of pools
of blood and regardless of blood going down the pant leg of Mr.
Goldman; that you can opine that all of those wounds were inflicted
first to last within less than 60 seconds, true?

MR. MEDVENE: Argumentative question, Your Honor. Object on that basis.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: Yes. That is my opinion and I would like to show you.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You answered the question, Dr. Spitz.

Now, let's examine, did you ever physically, in person, examine the
clothes of Mr. Goldman?

A. No, I saw the pictures.

Q. All right. Now, you have testified that the thigh wounds to the
left thigh did not bleed very much because what we have in our -- in
the thigh area of our body is, we have the quadriceps muscle is that
true; and we don't have a major artery until we get behind the femur,
correct?

A. Yes.

Q. So in other words, when Mr. Goldman suffered the wounds in the left
thigh, you certainly didn't think that that was a wound?

A. Let me just say, because I don't want to go on the record as having
said that the arteries are in the back, because that's not 100 percent
true. I didn't say that.

Q. Okay.

A. But having said that --

Q. Now, Dr. Spitz, you, in terms of your analysis of this case,
believe that the left thigh wounds did not bleed very much, correct?

A. The left thigh wounds did not bleed very much when compared to the
other wounds. The left thigh wounds entered a different type of tissue
so as compared to the other areas in the body, like the aorta and
other places, that thigh wounds bled very little. But as we know, it
was enough to stain the pants and it was probably enough for some of
the blood to go on the ground.

Q. Well, let's talk about that a little bit.

Where was the thigh wound in terms of it's relationship between, let's
say, the knee and the pelvis?

A. The thigh wound, as is shown on the photographs is about here.

Q. Okay. Now, Phil, can you put that picture of --

MR. PETROCELLI: Hold on.

JUROR: We want to see what he was doing.

THE WITNESS: The thigh wounds is about here.

MR. MEDVENE: If the Court -- if the Court please, may the record
indicate Dr. Golden is pointing to his --

THE WITNESS: Spitz.

MR. MEDVENE: Excuse me, Dr. Spitz is pointing to his left leg,
approximately how -- below your belt, Dr. Spitz.

(Witness measures with tape measure.)

THE WITNESS: Approximately 10 inches.

Q. It was 33 inches from his heal, was it not?

A. I measured 32.

THE COURT: Let's take a 10 minute recess. That's Dr. -- that's Dr.
Spitz's leg that was measured. (Break.)

(Jurors resume their respective seats.)

MR. BAKER: Thank you, Your Honor.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Dr. Spitz, Ron Goldman had what, 30 wounds?

A. I never counted them, but that could be.

Q. Well did it make any difference, the number of wounds he had, in
arriving at your opinions that he all the wounds from first to last
were inflicted in 60 seconds?

A. Yes. It made a difference in my -- My decision. My determination
was that the all these wounds were very likely inflicted in less than
a minute.

Q. But you didn't think it was necessary to count the wounds to come,
to any conclusion that they were, in fact, inflicted in 60 seconds or
less, right?

A. I decided it doesn't make any difference whether that's 29 or 35.

Q. And relative to the all of the blood in the caged-in area, that we
have been talking about, did you make a determination whether or not
there was any blood on the plant, the plant life that was in the
closed-in area?

A. I did not make any determination, but I wouldn't be surprised if
there was blood on the plant life.

Q. Now, the blood from the thigh wounds certainly did not travel
towards the waist of Mr. Goldman. You'd agree with that?

A. You mean upwards.

Q. That's what I mean.

A. No.

Q. You would not agree with it or you would agree with it -- poor
question.

A. No. I would agree that it probably did not travel upwards.

Q. Now Mr. Goldman's left pant leg was thoroughly encased with blood,
was it not, from the waist on down?

A. No.

Q. This photo's going to be a little rough, so -- That one.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) I apologize. What I want you to look at, sir, is the
left pant leg, and then answer the question again, sir, if, in fact,
the left pant leg is encased in blood from the waist on down.

MR. P. BAKER: This is 860.

(The instrument herein referred to as Photo of Ron Goldman on ground
lying in area of open gate was marked for identification as
Defendants' Exhibit No. 860.)

(Witness reviews exhibit 860.)

Q. Yes or no?

A. No, it's not, because some of it is a shadow. Because I have a
picture of the same area that shows it differently.

MR. P. BAKER: No. 38.

(Exhibit 38 is displayed.)

Q. From the waist on down?

A. This picture was taken at night and there is --

Q. From the waist on down?

A. I understand that.

Q. Can you answer my question for a change Dr. Spitz?

A. No, I disagree.

Q. Just say you disagree?

A. It is not encased in blood.

Q. You don't have to make a speech every time.

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, Mr. Baker's remarks.

THE WITNESS: It is not encased in blood.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) The blood comes from the waist and goes down towards
the feet, does it not?

A. It does.

Q. And, in fact, the left boot was bloody and the right boot was not,
correct?

A. There was blood.

Q. Put up the photo?

A. On the left boot and there was not, is my understanding, on the
right.

Q. That indicates that's quite a bit of blood; is it not?

(Photo is displayed.)

A. Well, there is blood on the boot, yes.

Q. And that blood came down the Levi's and was absorbed in the left
boot, correct?

A. Yes it went down on -- on the leg and this shows that the pants are
not drenched, as you say, and my picture doesn't show it's drenched
either and it came down, ran down on the boot, yes.

THE COURT REPORTER: What number is that, please?

MR. P. BAKER: That is 860.

(Indicating to exhibit 860.)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) The levis, the blood came down the levis, the Levi's
more likely than not were at this area over the boot and because
there's no blood here, and then bled into the boot area and was
absorbed by the canvas portion of that boot, correct, sir?

A. Yes.

Q. And there is that bleeding pattern, you would agree, is totally
consistent with the internal jugular vein being severed in this man as
one of the first wounds of the altercation, true?

A. Absolutely not.

Q. All right. Now, in terms of the amount of blood that is shown in
that photograph, sir, Mr. Goldman was upright for a period of time in
excess of 60 seconds, true, after the bleeding started?

(Indicating to Exhibit No. 860.)

A. No.

Q. Is it your testimony that all of the blood that we see in that
photograph is from the thigh wounds?

A. At least most of it, if not all of it is from the thigh wounds. And
as far as -- it's 60, more than in a minute of him being upright, I
disagree that it took longer than a minute and I disagree that he was
necessarily standing for that duration. But much of the time, held
upright.

Q. He was held upright?

A. Yes.

Q. All of the area above the -- what would be right about the pocket,
left pocket. All of that blood cannot be caused, we would at least
agree on that, by the wounds of the thigh, correct? Gravity has not
been repealed?

A. I'm sorry.

Q. Gravity hasn't been repealed. All of the blood above the pocket
area, is going to be caused by the internal jugular vein bleeding from
this man while he is in the fight, true?

A. No. No. No, there's a misinterpretation here.

MR. MEDVENE: Objection.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, in terms of your analysis of the altercation,
did Mr. Goldman attempt to kick the attacker?

A. Mr. Goldman did not attempt to kick the attacker. Mr. Goldman used
his left leg as a defense weapon.

Q. Okay. It was his left leg that was a defense weapon, right?

A. It was his left leg that he used to defend himself.

Q. Okay. How did he use -- to defend himself with his left leg?

A. If I may show, Your Honor.

(Witness demonstrates.)

Q. So that's how he got the wounds?

A. That's how he got the wounds to the -- to the thigh. That's how he
got the wounds to the hands. That's how he got the wounds to the
flank.

Q. Now, in your -- and you're sure, as you sit her now, that Mr.
Goldman was -- had his left leg extended in the air and he was
attacking or warding off an attacker who was to his left side,
correct?

You just demonstrated to us, sir, that you had your left leg extended
and you had your hands extended out to the left, did you not?

A. No.

I don't know. Maybe I did -- my opinion is that he exposed his left
side to the assailant and went like this (indicating).

If I'm showing a -- stretching my arms out to the -- to the left so be
it, like this --

Q. Okay. Fine and if you're standing?

A. I can further tell you that at that time the attacker was jabbing
the knife this way (indicating).

Q. He was jabbing it right at him. He had all of his weight basically
on his right foot, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, look at the TV monitor and tell the jury, if that is not a
cut, fresh cut in his right boot, that was made at the time of the
attack, and you can tell that because it's a fresh cut from a knife,
true?

A. It looks that way, yes.

Q. So he was kicking at the attacker with his right foot; was he not?

A. No.

Q. No?

A. I'm saying that he used his lower extremities right or left, or
both to defend himself.

Q. Well, I didn't hear right or left or both. When you were
demonstrating twice to the jury, I heard you say that the reason that
he was attacked on the left side, that the left thigh wounds and the
left flank wounds was, he was attacking or warding off his attacker
who was to his left side?

A. That's correct.

Q. Now it's to his left or right?

A. No. No. No, that's not what I said. I said at the time that he
sustained, that was the question, that he sustained the wounds in the
thigh, he went like this (indicating.)

Later on, or before we -- he may have done the same with the right leg
except at that moment when he did that, he did not get a wound on the
thigh or elsewhere.

Q. Where was he, in the closed-in area when he was warding off the
attacker with his left thigh?

A. Somewhere in the four by six.

Q. Can you be more vague?

A. Vague, no.

MR. MEDVENE: Objection.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. MEDVENE: If the Court, please, it's not called for, the remark by
Mr. Baker.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, in terms -- In terms of your examination and
determination of where everybody was in this reconstruction.

If in fact the internal jugular vein was the first vein severed, and
if, in fact, it bled down his left side and down his pants and down
into his boot, you would agree that he would still have the ability to
fight off an attacker for a period of time, five minutes or longer,
true?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Assumes facts not in evidence, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled. Hypothetical question.

THE WITNESS: Are you asking, if I may, so I can understand the
question, are you asking me whether with a severed jugular vein, he
could still fight for five minutes?

Is that what you're asking me?

Q. I'll be happy to rephrase the question.

THE COURT: Excuse me. Ask the -- asked the question. Answer that.

THE WITNESS: Yes. None of the injuries of Mr. Goldman were immediately
incapacitating.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Well, if in fact, he had the severed internal
jugular vein, he could then have fought off his attacker at the front
of the gate, could he not?

A. Theoretically, yes.

Q. He could have fought off his attacker as he went into the dirt and
closed-in area where the keys and the envelope were found, could he
not?

A. Theoretically, yes. He could have fought his attacker anywhere.

Q. And he could have continued to fight and kick at his attacker
during the time period that the -- that the struggle took place,
correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And he could have actually taken a swing or hit his attacker during
that period of time, could he not?

A. He could have.

Q. And this picture is a little rough as well. Mr. Goldman had
substantial bruises on his right hand, didn't he?

A. Bruises?

Q. Yes.

A. He had some bruising. I wouldn't say -- I wouldn't call that
substantial. He had a lot of cuts and he had a lot of scrapings.

MR. P. BAKER: Exhibit 878.

(The instrument herein referred to as Photo of Ron Goldman's hand was
marked for identification as Defendants' Exhibit No. 878.)

Q. The bruises on the middle knuckle and the knuckles, those are
substantial bruises, are they not?

A. I don't know what you call substantial.

Q. Those are consistent?

A. These are all bruises.

Q. Those are consistent with him attempting to, or hitting his
attacker, are they not, sir?

A. I am not sure whether they're from hitting at an attacker or
whether they are from hitting the ground or from hitting the wall or
from hitting the fence, or from hitting the tree. There is abrasions
in there as well. There's a little abrasion in this area and here. I
am not certain, exactly what he hit. He hit something.

(Indicating to photo.)

Q. Doctor, let me ask you the question again.

Those bruises are consistent with Mr. Goldman hitting his attacker
somewhere on his body, regardless of when you know, specifically,
whether he did or not, would you agree with that? True?

A. Sir?

Q. True?

A. They are consistent with him hitting anything.

Q. But we know at least one thing, he wasn't fighting the fence, he
was fighting his attacker, don't we?

A. But we -- he collapsed at some time.

Q. Sir, can you answer my question?

A. Yes. We know he was fighting his attacker.

Q. And in fighting his attacker, it is not inconsistent for Mr.
Goldman to try to have hit his attacker. You would agree with that,
this is a fight for his life; is it not?

A. Yes.

Q. And those bruises on his right hand are consistent with hitting an
attacker, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Thank you. Take that down, please.

Now, did you review any of the photographs of Mr. Simpson's that were
taken on the 15th or the 17th day of June 1994 other than his hands?

A. Yes.

Q. Did you see any bruises on Mr. Simpson's body that would be
consistent with having Mr. Goldman attempt to hit him with a hand that
produced a bruise such as we have just put on the board?

A. I saw a bruise on Mr. Simpson's left arm.

Q. You saw a bruise on Mr. Simpson's left arm?

A. Yes.

Q. And --

A. There's a picture that shows it.

Q. Okay.

And you think that's consistent?

A. I'm saying -- you are asking; is there a bruise? I say there is a
bruise and if there's a bruise, it's consistent.

Q. Okay. And did you see -- well, strike that.

Now, in terms of the marks that you say of Mr. Simpson's, are all
these fingernail marks. These you testify to these are quasi cuts,
correct in your deposition?

A. Semi-used.

Q. Well, let me see exactly what you used?

A. I said I didn't say semi-cuts, I said semi-blunt.

Q. Well, let's see exactly what you said?

A. That is exactly what I said.

Q. Page 55 line 7. (Reading:)

"Q. Do you have an opinion on the amount of bleeding that would have
occurred in the time that wounds was inflicted until it closed?

"A. The amount of bleeding.

"Q. Or the type of bleeding.

"A. What do you mean by type?

"Q. How much bleeding would there have been?

"A. Not much.

"Q. Why do you say that?

"Q. (sic) Because these are not cuts; they are, for lack of a better
term, quasi cuts. They're cuts by a blunt, semi-blunt object, which is
a fingernail. A fingernail is not sharp, a fingernail has measurable
thickness necessary and it crushes the skin and it causes more damage
inside than outward. So therefore you have a lot of swelling and
probably some pain associated with it."

That's what you said; is it not?

A. Fine.

Q. And so you don't believe that Mr. Simpson's, if it was him who was
the attacker, would have bled, correct?

A. No. That's not what this implies. This doesn't say he wouldn't have
bled.

Q. Dr. Spitz --

MR. MEDVENE: The Court please --

MR. BAKER: If you, and my question -- move to strike as not -- as not
responsive.

MR. MEDVENE: Your honor, he's in the middle of answering the question.

THE COURT: The answer's stricken. You may re-ask the question.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) In your view, there would not -- There would have
been no bleeding, correct?

A. From what?

Q. We're talking, sir, about what you have characterized in your
testimony as every one of the cuts on his left hand being a
fingernail, crush type, semi-blunt injury?

A. Yes.

Q. And so I take it, sir, that if these crush type semi-blunt
injuries, which cause more damage inside than outward, Mr. Simpson
would not have been bleeding, right?

A. I never said that.

Q. Which cut, in your opinion, would have bled, if any of them?

A. They probably would have all bleed, but not instantaneously.

In a crush, if you let me explain, the tissue, as the term implies or
indicates, is that the tissue is crushed and if blood in the bottom
bellows up, comes up, it needs to overcome the crushed area of tissue
which is crushed down.

It takes a few seconds for that to happen. So -- and furthermore, if
the hand is down, it may bleed a little sooner. If the hand is up, it
will take a little longer.

We all know that when we cut ourselves, if you raise the extremity,
the bleeding may even stop.

If you put it down, the bleeding will come.

Q. And what is -- are any of those cuts going to bleed more than a few
drops?

A. Yes. Some of them may.

Q. Which ones?

A. They are -- there are gouges in the side. Those will bleed. There
are fairly deep fingernail marks along the inside and the outer
surface on the back of the -- I think it's the ring finger or the
middle finger.

Those injuries will bleed. Those were fairly deep injuries. In fact,
there's one picture of the one on the middle finger, which bled, which
it is still bleeding when the picture was taken, which is many hours
later.

Q. That was bleeding. That wasn't oozing, that was active blood?

A. Oozing. Oozing to me is still bleeding just at a lower pace.

Q. When you were shown this picture by Mr. --

MR. MEDVENE: What's the number of this?

MR. P. BAKER: 714.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You told the jury, and demonstrated to the jury that
that was in the webbing of Mr. Simpson's hand. And you actually got
out of your chair and pointed to the webbing of his hand, did you not,
sir?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. And you meant to do that, Dr. Spitz, because you meant to have the
victim pulling down on his hands and grabbing him in the web of his
hands so as to cause those particular cuts, right?

A. No. I meant to do that because that was my opinion at that time
where these -- this one and that gouge -- These two are gouges, where
they were situated.

I subsequently, as you remember, corrected it and said that I was
wrong and repeat now that was wrong and that the actual injuries were
in the extension of the little finger if I'm not mistaken.

Q. You went outside. You talked to Mr. Medvene. You talked to Mr.
Petrocelli and they told you, you were wrong on this photograph. That
this photograph was not in the web at all. This photograph was under
the -- The what's this, the distal aspect or what is it called?

A. The extension of the little finger. There's clearly a medical term
for it.

Q. Well, don't you know it?

A. No. It's a hypothenar eminence.

Q. And you can see the wrist bone in that photograph, right?

A. I beg your pardon?

Q. You can see the bone that protrudes?

A. No. Mr. Medvene or Mr. Petrocelli did not tell me. I made a
mistake. Mr. Medvene or Mr. Petrocelli, or one of the other gentlemen
told me.

Q. Can you answer my question?

A. Whether -- I would like to see the picture, another picture which
will tell me better where these injuries are located.

Q. Now, you want to go back -- move to strike as nonresponsive -- and
see if you can answer my question.

THE COURT: Stricken.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) My question was, sir, that you can see the wrist
bone in that photograph, right?

A. Yes.

Q. And it doesn't make sense that somebody's hand is underneath and
around back in here when they could pull their hand all the way over
into the webbing. That's why you wanted that photograph to be in the
webbing because you are partisan advocate as you sit in this witness
chair?

A. Absolutely not. Absolutely not. Under any circumstances.

THE COURT: Just a minute. I'm going to sustain the objection, that
it's argumentative.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, in terms, did either of those cuts produce a
drop of blood, in your opinion, sir?

A. I would say they probably did.

Q. They did?

A. Yes, they possibly did.

Q. How many drops did they produce?

A. I don't know that.

Q. How soon would they coagulate?

A. Mr. Baker, I don't know that they have coagulated on this picture.
There's a crust over this one and a crust over there. I would have to
be a wizard to tell you how many drops of blood came out of that and I
am not a wizard.

Q. Stipulated.

Now, what's a normal coagulation time for a -- for a human being?

A. A few seconds. It varies significantly.

Q. Well, give us the parameters?

A. It depends, as I indicated to you earlier, it depends on whether
the arm -- I'm not talking about a laboratory now, I'm talking about
whether the arm is down.

The practical thing, like grandmother has taught us, if you put the
arm down, it's going to bleed. So don't put it down, put it up. It
will stop.

Q. What's the coagulation time? I didn't ask you about when you put
the arm down or when you put the arm up, what's a normal coagulation
time?

A. Somewhere around ten seconds.

Q. And?

A. Ten, 15 seconds.

Q. And so if Mr. Simpson or any assailant gets gouged, there's going
to be a coagulation of those cuts in a very short period of time,
correct?

A. No. I didn't say that. I said that is not in a laboratory. I said
if the arm is down, it will bleed longer. If the arm is up, it will
bleed less or not at all.

Q. Well, but certainly those cuts are not going to take any three,
four, five minutes to coagulate before they quit bleeding, are they?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, Your Honor. Asked and answered. He explained
where the arm is.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, you wouldn't anticipate that any of these blunt
force, alleged fingernail marks would produce a trail of blood ten
minutes later, would you?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, Your Honor. Assumes facts not in evidence,
that something happened ten minutes later. There's no evidence of
that.

THE COURT: Rephrase that.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) As I understand the scenario that you believe
occurred, sir, is it your belief that these gouge marks were made by
Nicole Brown Simpson, and you demonstrated to us on Friday the
position that she was in, correct?

A. I don't know if I said that Nicole Simpson necessarily inflicted
these or that Ron Goldman inflicted these or that both of them
inflicted these.

I cannot tell you. Or that one inflicted one and the other one was
inflicted by somebody else. I did know that I said that I cannot tell
who inflicted the fingernail marks.

Q. And you don't know if the fingernail marks were inflicted by
anybody on June the 12, 1994 to Mr. Simpson's, hands, do you?

A. Yes, I do know. I have -- mean, I have some ideas about that. I
don't know if I know to tell you I was there and saw how they were
being inflicted. But I have reasons that I can give you why I think
that these are fingernail marks sustained which is consistent with the
timeframe of this altercation.

Q. There is no such thing as a typical fingernail mark. You would
agree with that?

A. There is no such thing as a typical fingernail mark, but there is
--

Q. You've answered the question.

A. A --

Q. And that was your testimony, in fact, when you had your deposition
taken on August 16, 1996 there -- that there is no such thing as a
typical fingernail mark and testified that every one of these was a
typical fingernail mark; isn't that true?

A. Yes. They are typical fingernail marks. I have to explain to you --

Q. No. You answered the question, Dr. Spitz.

Now in terms of the reconstruction of this case, did you then
determine after -- Well, strike that.

Your view was that Ron Goldman was upright when he got stabbed in the
left flank and it was either the first cut or very early on, right?

A. Yes.

Q. And was he standing, then, with his back to the assailant by the
front gate where we have blood?

A. He was standing with the left flank exposed to the assailant, the
way I told you earlier when I showed the raised leg --

Q. Now --

A. -- Raised left leg.

Q. Have you ever looked at -- At photographs of him while he was in
the closed-in area after his demise, and the blood pattern coming out
of that wound in the left flank?

A. I know that there -- yes, I have.

Q. Have you looked at a photograph?

A. Yes, I have.

Q. And you would agree that if this was a very early-on flank wound,
the blood from that flank wound would go down Mr. Goldman's side and
there wouldn't be wounds going, blood going across his back and down
to his right side, correct?

You don't understand the question?

A. No.

Q. Okay. The flank wound is one of the first wounds. The blood from
the hemorrhage from the track of that wound is going to come out the
wound and it's going to go down his back towards his waist, true?

A. No.

Q. If he's upright, it's going to go down his back and towards his
waist, true?

A. No, he's -- your making a wrong assumption.

Q. He's lying on his side and flank wound is inflicted before he
expires. The blood will emanate from that wounds and it will go across
his back from left to right. You would agree with that?

A. No, I will not agree with that. Let me explain to you why.

Q. Doctor, just answer my questions.

A. Okay.

Q. Will you -- Would you show that photograph?

MR. BAKER: Apologize. I'm having some trouble locating that
photograph.

Now, we'll come back to that as soon as we find that. Did you get it?

MR. P. BAKER: No, not yet.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) In terms of your scenario, then, Nicole Brown
Simpson and Ron Goldman, after the attack on the Nicole Brown Simpson,
never came in contact with each other, correct?

MR. MEDVENE: Asked and answered, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. BAKER: It's foundational.

THE COURT: I don't want to rush you, but you said two hours and I'm
waiting. So let's get on with it.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) In terms of the clothing of Nicole and Ron Goldman,
in your scenario, he comes in the gate. She's attacked, then he is a
attacked, correct?

They never touch each other; isn't that true?

MR. MEDVENE: Same objection. Asked and answered.

THE COURT: Answer the question.

THE WITNESS: Yes.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) And you don't have an explanation why there is
transfer of blood between Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman, that
there are 11 separate transfers of blood, on one clothing and the
other clothing, correct?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, Your Honor. Assumes facts not in evidence.
There's no facts to support that, none.

MR. BAKER: We'll make an offer of proof that that is in fact a fact --
facts of this case.

THE COURT: Okay. I'll sustain the objection. You may state it as a
hypothetical.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) I want you to assume that after the murders, and
there was an analysis done of the clothing of Nicole Brown Simpson and
Ron Goldman, there were 11, at least 11 separate transfers of blood
from one clothing to the other clothing. That is contrary to your
professed scenario of how these events occurred, true?

MR. MEDVENE: If the Court, please, lack of relevance. Objection, and
there are no facts to support that, Your Honor, that we know of.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Ladies and gentlemen, a hypothetical question is one where the
attorney possessing the hypothetical, sets the question up. And if
later the evidence does not support that hypothetical, then you must
consider the answer that he elicits from the witness in view of the
fact that the basis for the hypothetical was not established.

Okay. Everybody understand what that means?

That means the basis for that question, we allow the lawyer to ask the
question supposing that he's going to be able to prove something about
that at a later time. If he doesn't prove it up, then the question and
the answer is no good or you can give it the weight to which it's
entitled, subtracting out the hypothetical evidence that was not
proved. Okay?

Q. You want to answer the question, Doctor?

A. My opinion of this is that it supports my conclusion that there is
a single assailant with a single weapon.

Q. Well --

A. Because if there is a transfer, then there is others, of course.
There is blood of one victim on the weapon and then there will be
blood on the same weapon from the next victim.

Q. Doctor, You, if that were true, there would be minuscule -- that is
small amount of blood transferred because it would only be blood
transferred by the knife, correct?

A. I cannot discuss that. I am not an expert in blood spatter. I have
no expertise. I have no training. I have not read about it and I think
that if I'm going to go into the detail of how much is enough, I will
be misleading you and the jury and the judge.

Q. Let's just talk about simple physics for a minute.

If you say that -- That 11 transfers of blood from -- a hypothetical:
11 transfers of blood from clothing of one to the other, in fact is
made by a knife, they would be the blood of one victim taken to the
blood of the next victim only on the knife, correct.

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Lack of foundation, speculation, outside the
scope, no foundation.

MR. BAKER: He just said it, Your Honor.

THE COURT: I'll sustain the objection.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, in terms of your view of this particular case,
and your 60 seconds and 15 seconds, were you of the opinion that there
was any noise made whatsoever while these vicious and violent attacks
were going on?

A. There was.

Q. And what noise was -- were you of the opinion was made during this
minute and 15 seconds?

A. "Hey, hey, hey."

Q. Anything else, sir?

A. That's enough for me. That's enough for me.

Q. What else happened in the other minute and 14 seconds?

Any noise whatsoever that occurred, in your opinion, sir?

A. I am not aware of noise. I am only aware of that noise which I've
heard about, which I've read about. I'm not aware of other voice
noise. I don't think there's need to be -- for a need for other noise.
These people were busy.

Q. Well, isn't it true, sir, or do you know that when somebody is
being attacked, they commonly scream? They commonly yell?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Lack of foundation.

THE COURT: Sustained.

THE WITNESS: Yes, that is true. But somebody would have to explain to
me how Nicole Simpson could scream with her throat cut because when
you utter sound, what you are doing is bringing air from the lung
through the airway. Her airway was severed.

So how would she bring air over the vocal cords.

Q. Well, she only had, in your view, less than 15 seconds. But Mr.
Goldman had, in your view, 60 seconds plus. He was there while, for
the 15 seconds or thereabouts when Ms. Nicole Brown Simpson was being
murdered. And he said -- if he said anything at all, "hey, hey, hey,"
which took about one second, right?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, Your Honor sustained the last objection.
That's where this question is going.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Your view, Dr. Spitz, is that the L.A. County
Coroner's Office bungled everything they did in this case; isn't that
true?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Relevance, materiality, outside the scope.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. BAKER: You relied for your opinions on the photographs in the
autopsy report of the L.A. Coroner, County Coroner who you believe
bungled everything that they did in this case, correct?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, Your Honor. Compound.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. BAKER: On what ground, sir.

THE COURT: You may ask a specific bungle, but I'm not going to go
through this whole scenario of going through the coroner's reports in
terms of bungle.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You told the Los Angeles times on or before October
8, 1995 the following, quote "the O.J. case has vastly exposed the
inadequacies of that department," unquote.

MR. MEDVENE: Objection.

THE COURT: Sustained. It's irrelevant. You may ask about this killing
and these killings and the findings.

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, I'd like to approach.

THE COURT: No.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You said that, "I don't believe for a minute that
the verdict would have been different if the Coroner's Office had done
everything by the book and they bungled everything."

MR. MEDVENE: Objection.

THE COURT: Sustained. The jury's to disregard that. Court made a
ruling and attorneys continue to ask the same question. Counsel you're
not to do that.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Did you believe that the L.A. County Coroner's
Office bungled the autopsy report?

MR. MEDVENE: Same Objection, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. BAKER: I think it goes to his bias.

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Making argument in front of the jury.

THE COURT: Bias. Is he bias? He's plaintiffs' witness.

MR. BAKER: Can I have just a couple seconds? I want to get a
photograph, Your Honor.

(Pause in the proceedings.)

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, let me go to another area while they're doing
that.

Now, Dr. Spitz, your view is, of course, that this aorta was severed
and I believe within a very short period of time, Mr. Goldman would
have been incapacitated, correct?

A. I believe I stated that none of the wounds were immediately
incapacitating.

Q. Well, let me -- let me read what you testified to on Friday at page
147, volume 12, lines 25 discussing the wounds, flank wounds.
(Reading:)

"Q. And if this were the first wounds, Mr. Goldman would be
incapacitated within a matter of seconds. Would you agree with that?

"A. Probably.

"Q. Because what happens is, if this is the first wound, you have an
enormous loss of blood in the -- in terms of blood recirculating to
the heart and then being pumped up to the carotid arteries to put
oxygenated blood to the brain, correct?

"A. Well, he would lose consciousness there (sic) very quickly because
the brain would not get, although it would get blood, it would not get
enough blood."

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) The brain is very susceptible to oxygen deprivation.
That's what you testified to on Friday?

A. That is correct.

Q. All right. And so, if Mr. Goldman -- and you've testified that that
wound was either the first or very near the first wound he incurred,
that is the wound to the abdomen, correct?

A. If that's the impression I get, it is an early-on wound. I believe
that the defense wound on the leg, on the hands occurred earlier. It
is in my view the first of the major wounds --

Q. Well, let me read to you what you said in your deposition, sir.
(Reading:)

The sequence of the injuries to Mr. Golden -- page 24, line 22 -- I
believe is that the injury to the posterior abdominal area is either
first or very early on.

Q. That's what you said, correct, sir? That's what you said?

A. I know that that's what I said. What I'm trying to tell you is of
the major wounds --

THE COURT: Just a minute, Doctor.

MR. PETROCELLI: We'd like to have a page reference also. The time Mr.
Baker read from the trial at page 147. He neglected to read the
remainder of the answer which concludes at the top of page 149, which
was part and parcel of that inquiry Your Honor. And I object to this
and we ought to have time beforehand to know what he is reading so the
jury is not misled.

MR. BAKER: Well, I object to those comments.

THE COURT: Excuse me, Mr. Baker, if you're going to read from
anything, I think it is required of you to notify the opposing counsel
as to what you're going to read.

MR. BAKER: I have. I gave them the page and line number.

THE COURT: No, you didn't.

MR. BAKER: I did.

THE COURT: This last one.

MR. BAKER: All right. Now --

THE COURT: Okay. Let's take a ten-minute recess. Direct the jury back
in 10 minutes.

(Recess.)

(Jurors resume their respective seats.)

THE COURT: Mr. Baker, I think you gave them a page number. You didn't
give them enough time to get the document out.

MR. PETROCELLI: Exactly.

MR. BAKER: I'll give them more time.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, Dr. Spitz, you believed early on that the area
behind the peritoneal area, there was quarts of blood, liters of blood
in that area of the peritoneal space, right?

A. Well, when -- yes. Well, liters sounds like a -- quart sounds like
five, ten. That's not how it works. It's --

Q. Well, was that your belief or was that not your belief?

A. Yeah. My belief is that there was more than one.

Q. Now, on page 70, line 27 through 8, on page 71, let me just read
quickly what you said on Friday.

Okay. (Reading:)

"Q. By wound track, what do we mean?

"A. The track from line of the knife, through the tissues, from the
entrance into the flank until it pierced the aorta.

All this space here lined the sack containing the organs, was filled
with blood because the aorta seized the aorta, when the damage causes
the bleeding into this area.

This area behind the front compartment contained quarts of blood.
Liters of blood."

Q. That's what you testified to on Friday, right?

A. Yes.

Q. And how many quarts or how many liters of blood did it contain?

A. I don't know. But it in order to be filled with blood, you can
possibly have two or thereabouts.

Q. Two or more or just two?

A. Maybe two or less. Maybe two or more.

Q. Is it your opinion, then, sir, that Mr. Goldman's blood loss of two
quarts of blood caused his demise because there was an substantial
bleeding in the lungs, you agree to that?

A. Yes.

Q. There was insubstantial bleeding in the peritoneal cavity. You
agree with that?

A. Yes.

Q. And, in fact, if the aorta had been cut on one side, the other side
and the knife had gone through, as it had to, because you have an inch
cut in the exit hole of the aorta, there should have been, if the
bleeding had occurred early on, as I you say it occurred, there should
have been quarts of blood in the peritoneal cavity, true?

A. No, never. Never. Shall I explain it to you.

Q. Well, put up the picture, Phil.

MR. P. BAKER: Which one?

MR. BAKER: Yeah. And I apologize for the quality of this picture.

MR. P. BAKER: Page 1 of 1420.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) This is a --

MR. MEDVENE: Excuse me. Could we get a look at what this is?

MR. BAKER: On the contact sheet, page 1 of 1420.

THE COURT: I don't know what that means.

MR. P. BAKER: Contact sheet are the negatives of what Mr. Rokahr took.
This is page 1 of the pages of contact sheets which is a collage of
negatives.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, that red spot we're seeing is, in fact, a flank
wound, which you say was this devastating wound that you said early
on, caused the demise of Mr. Goldman?

A. This wound here is a stab wound situated right there.

Q. And the blood tract from that stab wounds goes across the back and
down towards the ground. There's a picture of Mr. Goldman lying on the
ground, correct, after he has expired?

A. From this injury?

I'm not sure I understand.

Q. Let me --

A. You mean externally or internally?

Q. This is a picture taken after Mr. Goldman has expired and is still
at the crime scene, lying on the dirted area with his shirt pulled up
as it was when they found him, correct; on the right -- left side?

A. Yes.

Q. This is the blood tracking down towards the ground area; is it not,
from the flank wound?

A. No. This is not blood tracking. This is a smear of blood which
probably occurred when they removed the body.

Q. Did you --, the body has not been touched when this picture was
taken?

A. Then it is.

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Assumes facts not in evidence.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. MEDVENE: Mr. Baker is testifying.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) I want you to assume that the body has never been
moved when this picture is taken and I want you to further assume that
this wood stake is a stake on the tree in the closed-in area. You have
any problem assuming that sir?

A. No.

Q. And then that the body has not been touched in the area of the
flank whatsoever at the time that photograph has been taken. Does that
alter your opinion in any way that that is blood coming from the flank
wound?

A. This is --.

Q. Does that alter your opinion?

A. No. It does not alter my opinion. This is --

Q. Thank you.

A. This is blood.

Q. Thank you. Now, if you have two quarts of blood in the back of the
retroperitoneal space of Mr. Goldman, this is going to cause certainly
a protuberance in tissue. It's not -- that's going to be visible by
the human eye just looking, true?

A. No.

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Assumes facts not in --

THE COURT: Excuse me.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) If you put two quarts of blood in your abdominal
cavity --

THE COURT: Did you make an objection -- I can't hear you.

MR. MEDVENE: Assumes facts not in evidence, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) If -- hypothetically, if you are correct, and there
is two quarts of blood that is in the retroperitoneal space, we can --
you know, maybe as I get older, my back is a little more firmer than
my abdomen. If we put two quarts of blood in the abdominal cavity,
that causes a major protuberance or expansion of the abdominal cavity,
true?

A. This is not the abdominal cavity.

Q. I understand that, sir.

A. That's behind the --

Q. Could you --

A. -- Behind the abdominal cavity.

Q. Sir?

A. And my answer to you is no, it does not cause any protuberance.

Q. Okay.

A. I'd explain that to you if you like.

Q. I'm sure you have an explanation for everything.

MR. MEDVENE: Objection to Mr. Baker's comments. Move to strike and ask
that he cease making them.

MR. BAKER: I think in view of this witness's comments, that I'm
totally entitled to make those comments, Your Honor.

THE COURT: I'll sustain the objection. Please don't make -- because
this witness is also being admonished not to volunteer any answer that
is not asked by the question, please.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, did you review any of Dr. Goldman's (sic)
testimony in the preliminary hearing?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Relevance, hearsay, Your Honor.

And it opens up an area.

THE COURT: Does not open up an area. If it's something he read before
the deposition, he may inquire.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Did you or did you not?

A. I don't recall.

Q. You don't have a recollection one way or the other?

A. No.

Q. All right.

Now, in terms -- one more area, sir. In terms of the -- of Mr.
Simpson, you went through all of the photographs -- well, strike that.

In the closed-in area, this four foot by six foot area, based upon
your reconstruction, there was hand-to-hand combat going on in that
area between Mr. Goldman and -- Mr. Goldman and the assailant,
correct?

A. Yes.

Q. He was striking out. He was kicking. He was attempting to hit the
assailant, correct?

A. No, I don't think so. I think he wasn't kicking. I think he was
using his lower extremities to defend himself, to put them out as a
barrier. That's what you do. Like when you put your hands out to grab
the knife or to do something to prevent the blade from hitting your
body.

So that's when you do, these kind of things instinctively, protecting
the face and chest.

Q. Well, instinctively protecting the face and chest. We saw where the
bloody boot had, more likely than not, came in contact with the knife?

A. That is correct. He fought off the assailant like that.

Q. Okay. Except with the other boot, right?

A. I beg your pardon.

Q. The cut is on the right, sir?

A. I'm talking about the injury to the thigh. When he turned and got
the cut on the boot, he used his right leg.

Q. He wouldn't have been kicking, and you can tell that he wouldn't
have been trying to kick the knife out of -- out of the assailant's
hand?

A. He may have been kicking. But the usual and the expected is that
people use their extremities to ward off an on-coming blade, other
than in contrast to what happened -- what happens in gun shot wounds.

Q. The usual and expected, right, in a knife fight?

A. This is --

Q. Okay. Thank you, sir.

Now, you -- Mr. Goldman is not only trying to ward off, he's trying to
get the knife away from the attacker. That's usual and expected; isn't
it?

A. And he is, exactly that. That's when he got the stab wounds between
the fingers.

Q. All right.

Now, Mr. Simpson's had some photographs taken, six of him, within a
couple of days of the murders and you reviewed those photographs,
correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Did Mr. Simpson's have any bruises on his abdominal area, chest or
abdomen?

A. I'm not aware of any.

Q. Put that up.

(Indicating to photo 4 of Exhibit No. 714.)

(The instrument herein referred to as a series of photos of O.J.
Simpson was marked for identification as Defendants' Exhibit No. 714.)

MR. P. BAKER: This is photo 4 of 714.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You see any bruises whatsoever?

A. No, I do not.

Q. Did you see any bruises on his face?

Put up the facial shot.

MR. P. BAKER: This is photograph 1, 2 and 3 of 714. (Photo Nos. 1, 2
and 3 or Exhibit No. 714 are displayed on TV screen.)

Q. No bruises there?

A. No. There are no bruises and I wouldn't expect any bruises, either.

Q. Put up his arm.

(Photo Nos 4 and 5 of Exhibit No. 714 are displayed.)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Bruises there, sir?

A. Here, there is a bruise.

Q. You believe that's a bruise?

A. That's what I thought, leaning on -- gleaned of a picture that I
saw of this area.

Q. So you think that's a bruise?

A. If it isn't so, let it not be, but it looks like a bruise.

Q. All right.

Those are the only two options.

Now, in terms of the -- that was the only thing on any part of his
body that you felt even resembled a bruise, right?

A. You mean this area?

Q. Yeah.

A. I would not expect bruises.

Q. I didn't ask you what you expect.

A. Yes. That is correct. That's the only bruise that I saw on the rest
of the body, other than the hands because there are bruises on the
hands.

Q. I've gone into the bruises on the hands from your quasi, crushing
fingernail cuts in some detail?

A. And bruises.

Q. And by the way, Doctor, when -- Mr. Goldman had some significant
blood on his hands, did he not?

A. Yes.

Q. And if he had, of course, come in contact with Mr. Simpson, if in
fact, Mr. Simpson were the assailant, blood would have been
transferred from the cuts that you saw on Mr. Goldman's hands to
clothing that Mr. Simpson, if he were the assailant, was wearing,
true?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Vague, calls for speculation. Calls for a
conclusion, lack of foundation.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) There would have to have been, if Mr. Goldman hit
his assailant and the cuts were made on his hands, there would have
been a transfer of blood from Mr. Goldman hands to the assailant,
correct?

MR. MEDVENE: Same objection. It's an argumentative question, Your
Honor.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) On which grounds, sir. I'm not following.

THE COURT: You can argue that to the jury.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Well, then, let's go back one thing and I'll try to
sit down.

When Nicole Brown Simpson had the carotid arteries severed, blood went
splirting out of those carotid arteries onto the attacker, onto the
tile and onto Ms. Simpson, true?

A. No.

Q. When you cut the carotid artery, Dr. Spitz, that carotid artery --
well, let's go back.

When the heart pumped blood, it pumps 20 percent to the brain, 80
percent to the rest of the body, correct?

A. I never thought of it that way. Maybe that's correct. I don't know
if it does that or not.

Q. And when it pumps blood from the heart, the two most direct sources
of oxygenated blood to the brain are the carotid left and right, true?

A. Yes.

Q. And they are a force relatively close to the heart as contrasted,
for example, to our abdomen, to our legs, et cetera?

A. Yes.

Q. And when that area is severed --

A. Yes.

Q. -- The blood, the heart is still pumping and the blood pushes out
of there when the left side contracts, true?

A. Yes.

Q. And so that is why this is an exceedingly bloody scene; is because
both of this young woman's carotid arteries were severed, true?

A. Because, of course, it's a bloody scene, all you need to do is look
at the walkway.

Q. I understand, sir. And if, in fact, someone had their left arm
where you placed it, that left arm would be covered in blood, wouldn't
it?

A. No.

Q. So your view of the severance of the carotid are that -- and when
you have whoever is the attacker, and you know kind of the position
that Mrs. Nicole Brown Simpson was in, down, with her head back and
all of that; have you a clear picture of -- and you're clear picture
of the bleeding that is caused by the direct severance of two carotid
arteries in this young woman does not cause closed bleeding upon the
assailant? True or untrue, sir?

A. Correct. My opinion is that in the scenario which I described, and
which is the basis of my opinion, there would be very little and maybe
none on the assailant.

Q. And there would be none on the assailant from Mr. Goldman attacking
the assailant after he had defensive wounds on his hands, correct?

A. Again, the same thing.

Q. Can you answer?

A. It may be.

Q. Can you answer my question for a change?

A. That is correct. There may be very little blood on the assailant
from Mr. Goldman.

Q. And?

A. Or from the first victim.

Q. Now, if Nicole Brown Simpson, she had defensive wounds on her hands
as well, didn't she?

A. Not bleeding defensive wounds, scratches.

Q. Okay.

So let's see if I got this straight, her wounds don't bleed but Mr.
O.J. Simpson if, in fact, he was the attacker, those nail crushing
injuries they bleed, right? Is that true? Is that your testimony or
not?

A. That is absolutely my testimony. All he need to --

Q. Nothing further from this witness.

A. You have to look at the witness' pictures.

Q. Nothing further from this witness.

THE COURT: Anything further?

THE CLERK: For the record, I like to clear up something about an
exhibit number, number 1420 was referred to earlier and it's not --
that's not the right number. It should be number 2051. That's already
been received in evidence.

REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. MEDVENE:

Q. Would you explain your last answer?

A. The --

MR. BAKER: Please ask a question, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled. Go ahead.

THE WITNESS: The injuries on Nicole Simpson's hands are superficial
scratches. They are not through the skin. They are not even far into
the skin. They are abrasion type injuries which scuff off the upper
most layer of the skin, the epidermis and then dry and become dark,
dark brown or black. These kind of injuries do not bleed.

The blood vessels in the skin are deeper down. So --

Q. How do you -- deep?

A. In the case of fingernail marks, if you look at the picture of the
fingernail marks, you see that the depth of a fingernail mark is
entirely different. All you need to do is display it on the camera, on
the -- on the television.

There is a depth to the fingernail mark, the fingernail markings into
the skin. The fingernail digs into the skin and there is a crater, in
the case of Nicole Simpson's abrasions, on the fingers, those don't
bleed.

Q. Now, you gave an opinion about whether or not you believe there
would be blood or much blood on the assailant who slashed the throat
of Nicole Brown Simpson by cutting the carotid arteries?

A. Please understand, first of all, the victim shields the assailant.
Her body shields him.

Secondly, I'm not sure that necessarily the hand was held across the
face, it probably was at one time or another. The same affect would be
from holding the hair back. She's got fairly long hair and it's
easiest and most available to be grabbed and pulled back.

The further -- when you hold a person over down like so (indicating).

MR. BAKER: I'm going to object to this. I'm going to object to his
demonstrating that. He should be required to answer a question.

THE COURT: What is the question?

MR. BAKER: I don't know.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) We were -- we were discussing, Your Honor, blood.
The likelihood that blood would not be on the assailant if the
assailant slashed Ms. Brown's throat. And the witness was answering
the question and attempting to explain why, and attempting to explain
the position and shielding by the -- by the assailant of the blood.

THE COURT: All right.

Finish your demonstration.

THE WITNESS: If the victim is held like this over the ground, and the
throat is slashed or stabbed, I can't -- I don't -- I can't see why
there should be blood on the assailant. The assailant is behind her,
either holding her head like so or holding the hair back.

All I can say is that the neck was taut, otherwise the knife would
never have gone into the vertebral column. She bled. She bled out
tremendous amounts, but downward and forward not upward and sideways
and certainly not through her body.

Q. Now, with respect to Mr. Goldman, what is the basis for your
opinion that there would not necessarily be much blood on the
assailant as a result of the assailant's --

A. Goldman was held in a grip, too. The same way, only the slashing of
the throat did not materialize and remained superficial because at
that time, there was no more resistance.

When Goldman was killed, he was held and all the assailant had to do
was leave go. That's when Goldman collapsed.

He's unconscious, unresponsive. Goldman was not dead at this time.
Goldman was left dying. He was not expired. He was expiring. He was --
he still had a heart beat, a mild heart beat. Not a good heart beat
because he had lost a lot of blood. But he died with time. He didn't
die at that moment.

MR. MEDVENE: Can you put up 2051 on the board, please.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) You wanted to give an explanation with respect to
2051 and the wounds and what appears to be blood shown. Could you give
that explanation now?

(Exhibit No. 2051 is displayed.)

A. This is blood that I think was transferred from the clothing. My
opinion is that somebody moved the clothing to the side to take the
picture. This is a very unimpressive wound.

But it's a fatal wound. Because this wounds goes into the aorta. This
is not a very big wound at all. This is what, three-quarter of an inch
or maybe an inch or half an inch, but it goes into the aorta. That's
the problem. This wound in the skin looks like nothing.

Q. By the way, does the autopsy report refer to this wound as a fatal
wound?

A. The autopsy report refers to it as a fatal wound. The autopsy
report describes that this is a wound that goes into the aorta. By
necessity, it would be a fatal wound and it refers to it. It says so
in the report.

Q. Exhibit 2053 not 2051. Why would there be no protuberance in the
retroperitoneal space if there was one to two quarts of blood?

A. May I have the chart back that we used on Friday?

Q. Yes.

A. With --

Q. Yes, sir. May I go get it, Your Honor?

THE COURT: (Nods in the affirmative.)

(Diagram displayed with section of human and aorta and knife cut
through it.)

Q. Can you explain, sir?

A. When the aorta is injured like it is here, this is the stab wounds
in the skin. This is the back. This is the front. This is the
abdominal cavity. There is the retroperitoneal cavity.

This is the area where the bleeding occurred, up and down. This is a
cupped section through the middle of the body. This is the stab
wounds. This is the aorta.

When there is bleeding into this area, you have the back, and there is
a vertebral body and there are lower ribs. So you don't -- there's no
protuberance here that back the muscles, shield it.

We all know that when you eat a heavy meal you have all this food in
the stomach, your abdomen protrudes because there's nothing in the
front here except skin and a little fat or sometimes more fat. But in
the back, there is heavy muscle that precludes swelling. People who
die from a ruptured aneurysm. An aneurysm is a bubble of the aorta
that suddenly busts and they bleed into the area in question here.

And I go and do an autopsy on a person like that. I don't know what
they died from. All I know is that they were found dead and I open the
body and I don't find any protuberance.

It would be wonderful if I looked, opened the body and I looked at a
protuberance. I wouldn't have to do an autopsy. This bleeding here
never protubes (sic). There is no such thing. That's a strange type of
medicine.

Q. Do we have 1977?

THE COURT REPORTER: Excuse me, what number is that diagram, please?

MR. GELBLUM: 2025.

(Referring to exhibit 2025, a diagram.)

(BY MR. MEDVENE) I want to show you now, remember we spoke earlier
about the photo of the aorta that was taken by the coroner?

A. Yes.

Q. And I want to put that up if I might.

MR. FOSTER: You want it up?

MR. MEDVENE: Yes.

MR. GELBLUM: 1977.

(Exhibit No. 1977 displayed.)

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Can you -- would you tell us what that photo taken
by the coroner shows?

MR. BAKER: Asked and answered Your Honor. That was all gone into on
Friday.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: This area here.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) The area in the front?

A. The yellow area, this area is the area of the aorta which is a pipe
opened up.

In other words, the aorta was slit across the side and opened up like
so. And it shows a nearly through and through cut nearly severed.

This tissue here, by the way, these two holes are origins of other
arteries. The aorta is the main artery of the body and from it, all
the other arteries emanate and these two are origins of two other
arteries.

This dark tissue, all around that the aorta is resting on -- is
totally infiltrated with blood tar.

This should be yellow, like chicken fat or like you can see in the
wounds of the thigh where you can see. Because of the slicing, you can
see the cut and then the yellow fat underneath.

If you want to put this on, then I can show this. There is --

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, who's directing the examination?

(BY MR. MEDVENE) While that's being put on --

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Can you draw the significance of the homogeneity
of the fat and what that has to do with blood pressure?

Steve, you want to put the aorta picture back up?

MR. BAKER: Outside the scope, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled. But I may sustain it for relevance.

(Referring to previous photo.)

MR. MEDVENE: We're going to tie it in in one second.

THE WITNESS: The fact that the entire area, every where that this
picture shows is infiltrated with blood indicates that there was a
blood pressure at the time, because otherwise the bleeding would not
have homogeneity infiltrated all this tissue with the same extent of
bleeding.

Q. What's the significance of there being a blood pressure in terms of
the sequencing of the aorta wound and any other wounds?

A. What the significance is, is that the heart was pumping with vigor
like at the outset of the altercation.

Q. And does that indicate anything to you in terms of the timing of
the wounds to the aorta and the timing of the cutting of the jugular
vein?

A. This supports that this occurred early on. Early on in the course
of this struggle and certainly before the jugular vein, because the
jugular vein is in the -- in the neck is covered by muscle, by skin,
and other soft tissues. And when that bled, it would bleed into these
tissues.

There is some bleeding described along the wound track, but there's no
bleeding anywhere else here because this was opened up and there is no
bleeding in this area under the skin.

The bleeding outward would have occurred to some extent. But most of
the bleeding from a semi severed jugular vein would have been inside.
There is no such bleeding.

Q. Now, Mr. Baker talked in a hypothetical about bleeding for five
minutes or more from a cut in the jugular vein. And can you fight, or
couldn't you fight? Is there any evidence that you found that that
jugular vein was bleeding for five minutes or more before death?

A. No. There's no -- no five minute jugular vein bleeding, not before
death. Maybe after, after Goldman was in the -- collapsed in the four
by six area that the jugular vein still oozed out some blood. But the
jugular vein -- but it's nature is a vein, not an artery.

Veins don't bleed like arteries. The aorta bleeds with great force,
very extensive. As I described on Friday, would hit -- a severed
artery would hit a 12-foot ceiling. A vein wouldn't do that, whether
it's a jugular vein or any other vein.

Q. Is there any indication from an examination of the tissue around
the jugular vein of swelling or anything that would support a
significant bleeding?

A. No swelling, no evidence of bleeding under the skin to any extent
or under the chest because that's where it would percolate downward.
In an upright individual, that's where it would go.

Q. In other words, if it was bleeding, it would have to be somewhere.

A. Where is that blood?

Q. Now, reference was made by Mr. Baker to certain stab wounds to Ms.
Brown's neck, and your basis for saying that they occurred in rapid
succession.

MR. MEDVENE: I want to get the board that shows 2015 and 2013, please.

(Mr. Foster complies. Indicating to display board marked "Sharp Force
Injuries and Blunt Force Trauma to Head Face and Neck of Ms. Brown." )

MR. MEDVENE: I'm sorry?

THE COURT REPORTER: May I have the number of that, please.

MR. MEDVENE: Yes. Number 2013 and 2015.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Dr. Spitz, would you come down, if you would, with
your pointer and point out what it is about those wounds that leads to
your conclusion that they were struck in rapid succession and very
quickly.

(Witness complies approaches board.)

MR. LEONARD: May I, Your Honor?

(Mr. Leonard repositions himself in courtroom.)

A. There are four wounds on the left side of the neck in a vertical
line all in one area.

There is the wounds across the front of the neck which starts, as you
can see here, right at this point (indicating).

If you make a schematic out of that -- Do you have a felt writer?

MR. PETROCELLI: Felt -- or I have --

THE WITNESS: There you go. If you make a schematic out of this, you
have four wounds, one, two, three, four, and you have the fifth wound
right there. This one is the fifth wound. The first, the second, the
third, the fourth.

I do not know whether this is one, two, three and four. I -- or
whether this is one, two, three and four.

I don't know whether they go from the top to the bottom or the bottom
to the top. But I do know that this is one action. One action in which
there is, like I demonstrated on Friday, a very rapid succession
before there is possibility of moving.

There is a holding and no movement sideways, because otherwise they
wouldn't all be oriented in the one perfect line. And this one,
extending from the same area, this is one unit.

Q. And where does the -- where does the slashing movement of the
throat start?

A. The slashing movement starts in the extension of the left lower
lip, the left angle of the mouth. If you run that, a vertical line
right through the bottom, that's where the deep side slash starts. The
actual slash starts much further over in proximity -- Right here.

Q. And how long did it take, in your opinion, in your judgment, to
deliver those stab wounds to the neck and then the slash cutting her
carotid artery?

A. One, two, three, four, angh (witness makes grunt sound) --

Q. Seconds?

A. That is seconds?

MR. MEDVENE: Good time to break.

MR. BAKER: Let me put, for the record, there were four movements
straight down by Dr. Spitz and a movement across from right to left.
The first four went straight down and his right hand was moving in a
vertical position from top to bottom and went down four straight
times. Before then, he moved his hand over to the left and moved it
across in a horizontal movement from left to right.

MR. MEDVENE: Dr. Spitz, where you made the movements were where the
stab wounds appear in the picture on the neck; is that correct?

A. Let me do it again.

THE COURT: Okay. Jurors. Jurors.

JUROR: Yes.

THE COURT: You're a juror. You have to watch the testimony and you
have to watch the witness as the witness is testifying. All right.

THE WITNESS: Difficult to. Difficult to do it on me, but this is how
it went.

(Witness demonstrates on himself.)

MR. BAKER: Now --

THE WITNESS: I'm sorry.

MR. MEDVENE: Excuse me, Mr. Baker.

MR. BAKER: I'm sorry.

THE WITNESS: One, two, three, four.

MR. BAKER: So now the record reflects that in this demonstration he --

MR. MEDVENE: If the Court please, I wonder if Mr.` Baker has an
opportunity --

MR. BAKER: No. I want the record to show, this is -- this is visual
testimony. I want the record to be complete with the visual
demonstration he just gave because it was nonverbal communication.

And now, instead of having four vertical up and down motions with his
hand, he had four straight in movements underneath the left ear and
then a movement across, from left to right across the neck area.

THE COURT: The record will indicate that the witness had a pencil or a
pen in his hand, made four movements into the neck area and then
across the neck.

MR. MEDVENE: Thank you.

THE COURT: Okay. 1:30, ladies and gentlemen. Don't talk about the
case, don't discuss the case.

(At 12:01 P.M. an adjournment was taken until 1:30 P.M. of the same
day.)

DEPARTMENT NO. WEQ
HON. HIROSHI FUJISAKI, JUDGE

(REGINA D. CHAVEZ, OFFICIAL REPORTER)

(The following proceedings were held in open court, out of the
presence of the jury.)

THE CLERK: For the record, Exhibit 2051 that was referred to this
morning, is actually 2053.

MR. PETROCELLI: Your Honor, at this time, I'd like to move all of the
exhibits into evidence that were referred to in the course of our
direct examination of Dr. Spitz.

The clerk requested it might be easier if we do it now than later, so
I will do so.

They are Exhibits 375, 2021, 2022, 2023, 3373, 2013, 2015, 378, 1999,

MR. BAKER: I'd like to -- I'm sorry; were you finished?

MR. PETROCELLI: No.

2000, 2003, 2004, 2005, 386, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1977, 2025,
2161, 2162, 2163, 2164, 2165, 1973, 826, 171, and 172.

And we'd also like to move in 2167, the notes -- the handwritten notes
taken -- of Dr. Spitz, made just before the noon hour.

MR. BAKER: I'd like to reserve on that, Your Honor. I can't remember
verbatim what all those are. 2167 -- these are cumulative, number one;
and number two, I don't think I heard 2051, which is Ron -- I just
referred to in the last few minutes -- maybe that's 2053.

THE CLERK: I said it exactly wrong; it's supposed to be 2051, not
2053.

MR. PETROCELLI: 2053 was referred to by you, not by us. Do you want
that in?

MR. BAKER: No, no, you put it on -- on the Elmo in the last few
minutes before --

MR. PETROCELLI: 2053 is fine

THE CLERK: No, no. 2051. 2051.

MR. BAKER: Who's on first?

MR. PETROCELLI: Where do we stand with these exhibits?

THE COURT: They're all received, subject to any objection Mr. Baker
may discover at a later time.

MR. PETROCELLI: Erin, do we have a final ruling? Is it 2151 or 53?

THE CLERK: It's 2051, 2051.

MR. PETROCELLI: Okay.

THE COURT: Okay. Bring the jury in.

MR. MEDVENE: If the Court please, there was one exhibit, 2016, that we
brought -- or wanted to bring to your attention. Originally, it was
not going to be shown.

There were some questions asked of the sequence of injuries to Ms.
Brown, and we wanted to show that one photo of the injury to the head.
And the doctor was going to relate it to when that occurred, as well
as when 2013 occurred. He was going to try to put those in sequence.

I believe that area was opened up on the cross-examination.

THE COURT: All right. I will allow it.

MR. MEDVENE: It will take us one moment to put that on the board, Your
Honor, because we had taken it off.

THE COURT: Counsel, tomorrow we're going to adjourn at 4:00.

JURORS: Thank you.

MR. PETROCELLI: Your Honor, I advised the clerk we have a change in
the order of witnesses. I also advised Mr. Blasier.

After Robin Cotton, we will have Renee Montgomery instead of Gary
Sims. We will be reversing the orders of Montgomery and Sims.

THE COURT: Thank you.

(Jurors resume their respective seats.)

(The following proceedings were held in open court, in the presence of
the jury.)

WERNER SPITZ, the witness on the stand at the time of the recess,
having been previously duly sworn, was examined and testified further
as follows:

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Dr. Spitz, when we were discussing the sequence of
injuries to Nicole Brown, we hadn't discussed what's been marked 2016,
which is a picture entitled, Right Side of the Head.

And I would appreciate your coming down, if you could, and giving us
your opinion when, in the -- roughly in the sequence of injuries, the
right side of the head injury occurred and how and its relationship to
2016, the picture of Ms. Brown with the carotid artery slashed.

(Witness approaches board.)

A. On Nicole Simpson's left side of the face in the -- around the left
side of the mouth, there is an bruise. It's obviously and definitely
there.

There is evidence of swelling and bruising of the lower lip on the
left side. The bruise extends down to the level of my pointer here.
And the top of the bruise is like that. (Indicating.)

Q. Around the upper lip?

A. Above the upper lip, which is also a little swollen.

Q. This, in my opinion, by its oval shape and the configuration of
this injury, that it's a punch with a fist.

This caused her to fall back and sustain the injury on the right top
of the head here, (indicating) from striking the stucco wall or the
bannister over it.

There is on -- when you look close at this, there are two areas where
the upper layer of the skin is scuffed off, like in a scraping, where
-- which we discussed earlier -- the upper layer of the skin is
hanging loose; you can actually see it there on the -- on the left,
and to a lesser extent, to the one on -- it's right where the skin is
hanging loose, and it's like a white tissue, little piece hanging. And
this would have occurred, in my view, probably -- more probably than
not, from striking the wall, the stucco wall.

In addition to that, she struck on the same wall, the back of the
right shoulder and the elbow, as she went back somewhat dazed from
this blow. And she was pulled up and held and stabbed and slashed.

Between the two, between this set of injuries and the ones I just
described, the blow to the face and the falling over on the wall, are
four stab wounds to the head, which did not penetrate the skull and --
and just manifested by a little cut in the skin.

So all these injuries: The head, the punch, the head wound and the
ones in the neck area, they're all in one area of the body, inflicted
in very rapid succession.

Q. Thank you, doctor.

JUROR: Could you tilt the exhibit forward? There's a glare across the
picture.

Thank you.

(Witness resumes seat at witness stand)

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Doctor, how much blood, in your opinion, would an
individual have to lose in order to die?

A. In a rapid blood loss, in an acute type of blood loss like in this
case, or in a shooting or a stabbing, there is usually one and a half
to two quarts of blood.

In a cavity -- assume somebody is shot in the chest and there's an
injury of the heart or the aorta or lung.

When we do an autopsy, normally there is one and a half to two quarts
of blood -- one and a half to two liters of blood. In a rapid blood
loss, the body cannot get used to the -- to the loss, and the heart
fails.

In a lung, people would lose blood over a long period of time, like
from a bleeding ulcer or some intestinal problem, they can use lose a
lot more than that: Much, much more than that, and survive and be
treated and do well.

Q. You said in a rapid blood loss like this case. If you would have
the amount of blood loss to cause death, why would this be rapid?

What would cause it to be rapid?

A. Well, the injury to the aorta would cause it to be rapid.

Q. What happens with the blood pressures?

A. All the injuries bled here. It's not like just the aorta bled; all
the injuries bled together.

The injury in the leg bled, as manifested by the blood on the pants.
All the injuries -- every time there is an opening in the -- in the
skin, it all adds together in the loss, and it's all lost within a
confined period of time.

Q. Now, I'm going to ask to be put on the board next in order, 216 --
I'm sorry -- to be put on the TV monitor. And this was some picture of
Mr. Goldman's jeans.

And where, in your opinion, did the blood come from?

A. This blood that's running down in here, you see very nicely how it
stains the pants -- it goes from practically the top of the pants, all
the way down to the leg -- to the end of the leg, where the shoe is.

This is blood that runs down from the -- runs down from the wound in
the -- in the thigh, runs down on the leg. The wound bled and run down
on the leg, and then was soaked up by the pants.

This blood is not blood that came on -- from the pants to the outside;
this is blood that ran down the leg and stained the pants from the
inside and was soaked into it.

(Indicating to photo number 216.)

A. (Continuing) Similarly to the blood on the upper portion of the
pants, which is -- which is all soaking from the bleeding wound and
the thigh.

Q. And the blood on the left shoe?

A. The blood on the left shoe is blood that runs down here, that
didn't meet the pants on the way, or did meet the pants up to where
the pants go, and then went on the shoe, eventually soaked into the
shoe and spread on the shoe.

MR. MEDVENE: Thank you, Steve.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Now, I believe there was a suggestion by counsel
of a jugular vein cut and some blood coming from the jugular vein and
finding its way to the pants.

And you were asked if, in your opinion, that occurred. And your answer
was?

A. No. In fact, I said never.

Q. And would you explain why you say that?

A. First of all, there is not this trail of blood from the jugular
vein down.

Secondly, as I explained earlier, the jugular vein only partially bled
to the outside. Most of the blood -- if the jugular vein is really
bleeding, then the jugular vein would cause bleeding under the skin
and into the muscles, not in the area of the neck and chest.

Thirdly, there is a wound in the chest which is totally, completely,
and entirely capable of explaining how the blood got over the pants
and onto the shoe. So I find it very difficult to take some remote --
remote possibility that to explain an event that is far more likely to
be explained in the way that I did.

Q. Now, you've possibly covered this, but when we're talking about the
pants and the blood on the pants, you'd made some reference to some of
the blood being somewhat above the thigh wound.

How, in your opinion, did it get there?

A. You mean on the pants?

Q. Yes.

A. Well, it means it gets soaked in and it spreads. Once it gets in
the fabric, it spreads. This is what makes a spot on fabric look like
more than it really is in terms of quantity of blood.

Q. I want to briefly -- since time was spent on it and in the
cross-examination -- talk for a moment about the sequence of wounds to
Mr. Goldman, and ask, with the Court's permission, if you'd be good
enough to -- you still have your ruler? If you would, mark off the
four-by-six area for me.

(The witness complies, uses measuring tape.)

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) This is roughly six feet. And so with the area,
could you describe the area for me?

A. May I borrow your chair?

(Bailiff nods affirmatively.)

THE WITNESS: This -- wait a minute.

MR. BAKER: It's your courtroom, Judge.

THE WITNESS: This would be the area.

(Indicating.)

THE WITNESS: This would be the area.

Is that okay?

Q. Yes.

(Indicating to coat hanger.)

Q. That would be the area where the struggle occurred?

A. That would be the area where the struggle occurred.

Q. In that area is marked by the --

A. By the coat hanger.

Q. -- by the coat hanger?

A. I --

Q. Yes.

(Counsel assists witness with tape measure.)

THE WITNESS: It's a little less than that.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) All right.

A. And this is four feet.

Q. Yes, sir.

A. Yes. It's a little less than this. It's about up to where the --
where the wrapping paper is.

Q. So within this area?

A. In this area.

Q. And within this area, when Mr. Goldman was stabbed in the aorta?

A. Yes.

Q. You had mentioned that he could have struggled for 40 to 60
seconds.

What could have happened -- could all the actions that Mr. Baker asked
you about have occurred within this confined space in that 40 to 60
seconds?

A. Absolutely.

MR. BAKER: Objection. Leading, vague, ambiguous as to what actions.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. Now, Mr. Baker mentioned an envelope being somewhere and a pager
dropping, how -- and some blood on a railing.

How long would it have taken for those actions that Mr. Baker asked
you about, in your opinion, to have occurred within this confined
area?

A. You mean dropping these objects?

Q. Yes.

A. Seconds. Seconds.

Q. And could a violent struggle have taken place over the period of
time after Mr. A -- or Mr. Goldman's aorta was stabbed?

A. Absolutely. The aorta is not an immediately incapacitating wound,
not in that sense, not instant by -- this is not you cut the nervous
system. Bleeding has to occur first.

Q. Do you have a watch?

A. Not only bleeding, but a lot of bleeding.

The watch, yes.

Q. All right. What I'd like you to do, because you've described --
well, first, if you would just describe for me quickly the wound that
-- how many major wounds were there, because Mr. Baker asked you about
a number of wounds.

How many major wounds were there?

A. There were -- there were, going from top to bottom, not in sequence
-- there was -- there were the wounds in the neck area; there were two
stab wounds in the chest on the right side. There was one wound in the
left flank.

I do not consider the wound in the thigh as a major wound, for the
simple reason that it is not a life-threatening injury.

Q. Now, were there wounds to the lung?

A. The two stab wounds in the right side of the chest entered the
lung, penetrated the lung.

Q. When Mr. Goldman died, had his lungs collapsed?

A. No. The right lung could have collapsed, given time, but it did not
collapse because there was no time.

Q. And what is the significance of that in terms of the time that it
might have taken Mr. Goldman to die?

A. His breathing stopped relatively early and his -- a significant
exit of air from the lung into the chest cavity did not occur to cause
a compression and collapse of the lung.

If I -- if I -- well, I can say that in the chest cavity, normally
there is a mild vacuum to keep the lung suspended; otherwise, the lung
-- the lung would collapse. Inside the lung is what is atmospheric
pressure. The lung is opened by way of the air ways to the atmosphere.
Atmospheric pressure is, as we know, quite high. Around the lung, it
is a negative pressure, mild vacuum, not a very strong vacuum, a mild
vacuum, so that when that vacuum is interrupted by a stab wound in the
lung, there is atmospheric pressure transferred into this space around
the lung, and the lung would collapse.

It did not collapse in this case.

Q. Now, during the struggle -- you saw some pictures of what appeared
to be bruising on Mr. Goldman's hand, around his knuckle area?

A. Yes.

Q. In your opinion, what is the -- you weren't there, but what is the
most likely cause of that?

A. There was not only bruising, there was bruising, and over the
bruising, in the middle, there were abrasions. And if you look at the
picture, you will see that there is a dark area in the middle. That's
an abrasion. That's where the upper layer of the skin is scuffed off.
And it dried and became like leather and became dark brown to black.

That, in my opinion, is far more likely the result of striking a
rough, firm object, like the wall or the bannister or the tree, or
something of that nature, rather than a person.

Q. I'm going to ask, with the Court's permission, if you could --

You said the struggle lasted approximately a minute. And you've heard
the questions of Mr. Baker in terms of the various activities that
occurred within the struggle.

Could you mark off on your watch for me -- and I'll be quiet for a
minute -- 60 seconds, that period within which you said the activities
occurred, starting now.

A. Let me start according to my watch.

(Witness pounds pager against witness stand.)

(Pause in proceedings.)

(Witness hits pager against witness stand.)

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Is there any question, any actions Mr. Baker asked
you about, or all the activities you described, could have happened
within the 60 seconds?

A. The 60 seconds is long.

Q. Let me move to the topic of fingernails, if I might.

MR. MEDVENE: And put on the board, please -- I'll look at 545 and 547
and 548 on the TV monitor.

(The instrument herein referred was marked for identification as
Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 545.)

(The instrument herein referred to was marked for identification as
Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 547.)

(The instrument herein referred to was marked for identification as
Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 548.)

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Can you describe for the jury and the Court where
on there you've identified his fingernail marks.

And I'm going to ask you some follow-up questions.

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, I object. This is cumulative; asked and
answered.

THE COURT: Sustained. We went through this on your direct examination.

MR. MEDVENE: I did. Mr. Baker asked some questions on cross but I
didn't ask.

THE COURT: If you want to redirect, redirect; Let's not go over the
same testimony we got on direct.

MR. MEDVENE: All right, Your Honor.

THE COURT: It's a day and a half with this witness, two days.

MR. MEDVENE: All right, Your Honor.

Mr. Baker asked you some questions about typical fingernail marks or
typical fingernail injuries.

Could you look, if you would, at 545 and -- or -- let's step back.

Could you go through for me why you say the marks you identified, not
only on this picture but the other pictures, in your opinion, were
fingernail marks?

A. Whereas there is not such a thing as a typical fingernail mark is
only because there are various types of fingernail marks.

The fingernail marks, as this picture shows, can have gouges, where
the fingernail scoops out a piece of tissue. This is not due to what I
did this morning, digging in my fingers into the skin. This is a
digging in and scooping out. And it gives rise to a missing piece of
skin.

That is what this is and this is.

Don't make it too big.

This and that.

And then there are scratches, and those are like here, and there is
another one here. And this one here is one line. And then on -- within
that line are little, dark spots, dots, if you will, which are due to
the fact that as the finger or fingers scrape the skin, they create a
creasing of the skin, and the finger continues, or fingers continue
over the crests of the creases, causing little defects in the crease,
causing little scabs to form.

So we have a fingernail mark and we have a -- totally different
fingernails marks, and yet both are typical fingernail marks, but they
look completely different.

Then we have a third type of fingernail mark, which is on the fingers,
which is here and there. And there are some more on the inside
surface, which are not depicted here.

And these -- you will see all of these that I will show you are
curved, and ones on the inside are curved, too. And they are done by a
fingernail which digs in, and the fingernail is curved and it leaves a
curved mark.

That's what you have here and here.

And then, as I say, there were some others. There's another picture.

Q. Does the location of the marks have anything to do with your
conclusion that they're fingernail marks?

A. The location is significant, because it is between the fingers. It
is in an area that is accessible to the victim. It is only on the left
hand.

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, I'm going to object at this point. We've been
over this all on Friday.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. MEDVENE: I have nothing further, Dr. Spitz. Thank you very much.

MR. BAKER: Recross.

RECROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. BAKER:

Q. Now, Doctor --

MR. BAKER: Flip that back on, whatever number that is.

MR. P. BAKER: The finger?

MR. BAKER: The finger.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, Doctor, just a couple quick questions.

You've testified in your deposition, there was no typical fingernail
marks, right?

A. Yes.

Q. All right. In every mark on that hand, some of us believe that we
have had on our hands at some time without any fingernail coming
anywhere near our hands.

A. I'm sorry; say that again.

MR. MEDVENE: Objection it's an argumentative statement.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You know, when you get a cut on your hand and you
don't -- get out of the shower or something and you see there's a
couple scabs there and they look like the scabs that you say are
fingernail cuts, here, and these are fingernail cuts there, and --

Have you ever had the experience of seeing scabs like that and you
don't have any idea where they came from?

A. Mr. Baker --

Q. Have you ever had those types of scabs and have no idea -- on your
hands and have no idea where they came from? Yes or no?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Thank you.

Now, in terms, Doctor, of curves --

MR. BAKER: Move that back a little bit.

Q. (Continuing) -- these curves, cuts with curves, you say that's
caused with the fingernails, that's caused by grabbing, right?

That's your view of how those cuts are incurred, correct?

A. No, Mr. Baker. I never used, and never will use the word "cut" for
a fingernail mark, because a fingernail mark is not a cut.

Q. Okay.

And I thought that you testified earlier that the Ron Goldman ones,
the aorta was punctured, would lose consciousness very, very quickly?

A. Yes, I did. But he wouldn't lose all of the consciousness all at
one time.

Q. Well, let me talk about the -- just the concept of consciousness
okay?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, Your Honor. Outside the scope of redirect.

MR. BAKER: I don't think so, sir.

THE COURT: The question on redirect was time of death, as opposed to
time of consciousness.

Sustained.

MR. BAKER: May I be heard on that, Your Honor?

THE COURT: No. We've been through this once already. Let's not belabor
the same issues over --

MR. BAKER: Okay.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Okay. Let's put this other board up we had over
here.

THE COURT: You might turn it around the other way.

(Counsel displays exhibit)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) As I understand, sir, you are of the opinion, in the
lower left-hand corner of Ms. Nicole Brown Simpson's mouth, she was
punched, right?

A. Yes.

Q. And that punch, in your analysis of the situation, took place with
the assailant in front of her, correct?

A. (No verbal response.)

Q. They're going to get tougher, these questions.

A. No, that's not a tough question. It's just that I'm thinking, would
they necessarily have to be standing in front of her, because she is
turning her face that way (indicating), then she is still, with her
body facing forward, and with her face turned like (indicating) in my
case, now turned to the left. And if the assailant is on her left, he
could punch her and create the same injury.

Q. Doctor, do you have an opinion, not if he was turned this way and
she was turned that way and whatever -- you have testified in this
court of law, that the assailant was in front of her for a period of
time when she got the defensive wounds on her hand.

A. Yes.

Q. Did you form an opinion, yes or no, that these bruise marks,
including the swelling, was made with the assailant in front of her?

A. What swelling are you talking about?

Q. You came up here and pointed out swelling on Ms. Nicole Brown
Simpson's lip?

A. Yes. This is -- I don't know if he's in front of her or if he's
sideways.

Q. And if the assailant is in front of her, that's consistent with
being on the left side of her face, with someone attempting to make
physical contact with the right fist, correct?

A. I never said the right fist, did I?

Q. I didn't ask you what you said; I asked you a question, sir: Is it
not consistent with an assailant being in the front of Ms. Nicole
Brown Simpson and making contact with her face with his right fist?

A. Yes, it is consistent. However --

Q. You've answered the question, sir.

It is also consistent that it had to happen early because there's
swelling; and you testified on Friday, you wouldn't get a bruise and
swelling after death, true?

A. Yes.

Q. Also, true that, if on your Exhibit 2167, the assailant is behind
the victim, the knife has to be torqued around and come down; and then
as you demonstrated right where I'm standing, then go sideways, left
to right; isn't that true?

A. No. Absolutely not.

Q. Isn't it true, sir --

MR. BAKER: Put up the picture with the, you know, Levi's.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) On this particular picture, you testified a few
moments ago that you believe somebody moved Mr. Goldman's shirt to
take that picture. Is that what you testified?

A. I don't know if they did. All I said was that was a possibility. If
you tell me that's not a possibility, so be it.

Q. That would be evidence tampering, would it not, sir?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection.

THE COURT: Sustained. Jury to disregard that question.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) This indicates there is blood from that wound that
is going from the left side of Mr. Goldman, down into the area of the
dirt below him; is that not true. Sir?

A. This indicates that there is a small amount of blood running
downward, yes.

Q. And there isn't any -- strike that.

MR. BAKER: Put on the other photo. Yeah.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Did you look at this photo, sir?

A. Yes.

Q. And that photo was represented to you to depict Mr. Goldman as he
was discovered at the crime scene?

A. Yes.

Q. With his shirt up?

A. This is out of focus.

Q. I didn't ask you if it was in focus.

A. Well, I can't see what you are talking about.

I'd like to see what you're talking about, too.

MR. P. BAKER: It's 38.

THE COURT: Is that the best focus you can do?

(Referring to Exhibit 38.)

Q. That was represented to you to be Mr. Goldman as he was found at
the crime scene, with the shirt in the position that is depicted on
Exhibit No. 38 on the monitor, true?

A. Yes.

Q. And that doesn't indicate to you that anybody has moved a shirt
from one of those photos to the other, true?

A. Possibly not.

Q. And now, relative to your view that there would be great force,
very high blood pressure from the puncture of the aorta, that would
have taken place, in your opinion, as you indicated, first, one of the
first wounds, true?

You're not following me?

A. No.

Q. You indicated when Mr. Medvene was asking you some questions about
the great force, the great pressure of the aorta when it is perforated
by this knife -- that is a knife five and a half inches long and at
least a half an inch wide -- when it enters the aorta, right?

A. I indicated that the pressure in the arterial system of the body is
increased during an altercation, and that it is anyhow very -- quite
high and much higher than in the venous system.

Q. You have testified before, sir, that if in fact there is an
aneurysm -- the lining between the aorta and the peritoneum -- the
peritoneal cavity, the -- namely, the peritoneum is so thin and the
blood pressure is so great, it will burst through the peritoneum and
bleed into the peritoneal cavity, right?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Assumes facts not in evidence. I believe it
misstates his testimony.

THE WITNESS: I don't think I said that.

MR. BAKER: Have you never --

MR. MEDVENE: I thought he was talking about here, Your Honor.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You have never said that in any of your testimony,
correct?

I'm not talking about this case; I'm talking about any case ever --
never testified under penalty of perjury, or written in any book, that
if in fact you have an aneurysm of the aorta, where you have it in the
location below the rib cage, that it will cause enough pressure to
perforate the peritoneum and bleed into the peritoneal cavity?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection. Outside the scope of redirect.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: No. I don't see how there will be 100 ml or 100 cc's of
blood entering the peritoneal cavity, other than the perforation by
the tip of the knife as it goes through the aorta, perforation of the
peritoneum, which covers the aorta and the tip of the knife, makes a
hole in the peritoneum, and small amount of blood enters the
peritoneal cavity.

Q. And I think we've discussed at some length that blood, like other
fluid, takes the path of least resistance, whether under pressure or
not, correct?

A. I, to this -- I know you have brought that up, but I don't know
what you mean by that.

Q. Well, does not fluid, such as blood, take the path of least
resistance; that is, it will flow to the area of least resistance,
doesn't flow uphill; it flows downhill, doesn't flow into solid space,
flows into where there's a space for adequate volume for the fluid to
flow to; isn't that what path of least resistance means?

A. Well, that my be true when blood from the top of the mountain flows
into the valley. I don't know if that's applicable to what happened
here.

Q. Let me give you a hypothetical.

You have determined, based on your analysis of the case, that the
wounds to the chest occurred late because there is a lack of blood in
the right chest cavity, true?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, Your Honor. Outside the scope of redirect.

MR. BAKER: He talked about that.

THE COURT: He did. Overruled.

THE WITNESS: Can you ask me again?

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Well, in terms, sir, of your analysis and the timing
of the wounds, it was your conclusion, was it not, that the wounds to
the chest that perforated into the thoracic or lung cavity, and
perforated the lungs themselves, occurred late in the struggle,
because there was a small amount of blood accumulated in the right
pleural cavity?

A. Yes.

Q. All right.

Now, I want you to assume the following facts to be true. I want you
to assume that, as this altercation takes place, the first wound is
the internal jugular vein. And I want you to assume that Mr. Goldman
continues to fight after the initial injury to the internal jugular
vein.

And I want you to assume that there is an all-out war in the area, six
feet by four feet.

And I want you to further assume that after Mr. Goldman has fought,
bruised Mr. Simpson, or the assailant in multiple places, because
there is a huge fight in that area and he is fighting for his life.

I want you to further assume that after all of this occurs, there is
stab wounds to his hands, to his neck, to his head. That then there is
a wound. He -- strike that -- then he goes down on his right side.

And as he is down on his right side, the last wound is the wound with
his left flank sticking in the air, and the assailants or assailant
puts a knife into that area.

That would be consistent with 100 cc's of blood going into the
peritoneal cavity; that would be consistent with the wounds and the
chest wounds taking place just before he goes down; and that could be
-- would be consistent with him fighting for a period of time. And all
of the hole being dug. There's an envelope, pager being spread
throughout the area: Blood at the front pole, blood on the north gate,
blood on the east side, blood pools on the north side. You would agree
or disagree?

MR. MEDVENE: Objection, your honor. Improper hypothetical.

THE COURT: Overruled.

MR. MEDVENE: Also compound.

THE WITNESS: This scenario that you have indicated is a different
case. That is totally impossible in so many places. I'd have to go
through them and tell you.

Q. Thank you.

Now, doctor, one area -- and I'm going to put up this hand. You talked
about abrasions and this hand being consistent with --

MR. P. BAKER: 878.

(Exhibit 878 displayed.)

Q. (Continuing) -- Consistent with scraping himself on the ground,
correct?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. There's no scrapings in the area over the knuckle, is there, sir?

A. No, there's no scraping. That's the only place where there's no
scrape.

Q. There's no scraping there, is there?

A. I'm not so sure about that, because there is a scraping here; there
is a scraping here. (Indicating.)

Q. Was that a finger?

A. Excuse me. You asked me the question. I'd like to answer it.

There's a scraping here, here, here, here, there, there, and there and
over these and here and here and there. (Indicating.)

MR. MEDVENE: If the record could show that Dr. Spitz has pointed out
scrapings on each of the four fingers shown in various locations on
each finger.

THE COURT: So indicated.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Are those fingernail cuts?

A. No.

Q. They're not typical of fingernail cuts, are they?

A. They are not, not typical. A fingernail cut does not have a bruise
around it.

Q. Doctor, are they typical of fingernail cuts?

A. No; they're not fingernail cuts.

Q. Thank you.

MR. BAKER: Your Honor --

A. They're not fingernail marks. There is no such thing as a
fingernail cut.

Q. A fingernail quasi cut?

A. 0h, yeah.

Q. That's what you called them, fingernail quasi cuts.

THE COURT: Let's not go through that again.

MR. BAKER: I don't have anything further.

MR. MEDVENE: Just one question, Your Honor.

FURTHER REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. MEDVENE:

Q. You were asked a question if the blow to the jaw was consistent
with coming from the right hand.

Is it also consistent with it coming from the left hand?

A. It is coming from -- it is consistent as coming with the left hand;
absolutely.

MR. MEDVENE: Nothing further, Your Honor.

THE COURT: You're excused. Thank you.

THE COURT: Ten-minute recess, ladies and gentlemen .

(Recess.)

(Jurors resume their respective seats.)

(The following proceedings were held in open court, in the presence of
the jury.)

MR. MEDVENE: If the Court please, we would move in 2168 and 545.

I believe the other exhibits have been moved in already from the last
witness.

THE COURT: Okay. Received.

(The instrument previously marked as Plaintiffs' Exhibit 545 was
received in evidence.)

(The instrument previously marked as Plaintiffs' Exhibit 2168 was
received in evidence.)

MR. MEDVENE: Douglas Deedrick.

DOUGLAS DEEDRICK was called as a witness on behalf of the Plaintiffs,
was duly sworn, and testified as follows:

THE CLERK: You do solemnly swear that the testimony you may give in
the cause now pending before this court shall be the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

THE WITNESS: I do.

THE CLERK: And would you please state and spell your name for the
record.

THE WITNESS: My name is Douglas W. Deedrick. Deedrick is spelled
D-E-E-D-R-I-C-K.

DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. MEDVENE:

Q. Mr. Deedrick, where are you employed?

A. As Special Agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. I'm
currently assigned at the FBI laboratory in Washington, D.C.

Q. How long have you been with the FBI?

A. I've been with the FBI for over 24 years. I've been an agent since
February of 1986 (sic); a little over 20 years as an agent.

Q. What is your current assignment?

A. I'm the chief of the Hairs and Fibers Unit in the Scientific
Analysis Section of the FBI Laboratory.

I've been the unit chief now for about three years.

Q. Can you explain to the ladies and gentlemen of the jury what kind
of work the Hair and Fiber Unit does?

A. Well, our unit receives evidence from all around the country; and
also, we receive some items sometimes from foreign countries.

Most of the evidence that we look at comes from state, local police
investigating crimes of violence: Homicides, aggravated assaults,
sexual assaults, cases that may involve physical contact between
individuals, between a suspect and a victim, between a victim and an
object, or between two objects.

Q. You say you receive evidence. What do you mean?

What do you receive?

A. Well, evidence mainly comes in the form of clothing that may have
been worn by individuals suspected of crime to have been worn: Items
recovered and submitted from a crime scene, where a crime may have
been committed, where a crime they think may have been committed,
items from vehicles. It may come in clothing; it may -- could come in
debris packets, a lot of times.

From around the country, evidence is submitted in small packets. They
actually do the processing and we receive just the debris for
analysis.

Q. What do you try to determine when you examine the debris?

A. Well, we try to determine whether or not contact may have occurred
between two individuals, most of the time; as whether or not we can
link an object to an individual or two individuals to each other by
the evidence of hair evidence, fiber evidence, feathers, wood
particles and other -- other materials.

Q. How do you determine if contact between individuals or an
individual and an object has occurred?

A. Well, contact occurs all the time. We all know it; we may not
realize it. In fact, it can occur from a direct physical contact --
it's called the primary transfer -- or it can occur as a secondary
transfer.

A secondary transfer would be one where I might be sitting in a chair
somewhere; I deposit fibers as a primary transfer. The next person
coming in the chair sits in it, picks up the fibers or hairs, and it
becomes a secondary-type transfer.

So by looking at this hair and fiber evidence, it's possible to
determine whether or not, for instance, two people may have had
contact at one point.

Q. And how do you know that through this primary transfer or secondary
transfer?

A. Well --

Q. Give me -- if you can, give me an example.

A. Well, for instance, when clothing might be submitted from an
individual, say a victim in a case, it's processed for trace material,
such as hair and fiber.

These are then prepared on slides and examined with microscopes. These
questioned pieces of material, these question hairs, question fibers
are compared to known hair standards or known fiber standards from
another individual, or from -- from a particular location.

And once the comparison is made, then a determination as to whether or
not they match or they exhibit the same characteristics or if they're
different.

Q. In your opinion, what determines if there is an exchange or
transfer of hair and fibers from an object to an individual or an
individual to an individual?

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Vague.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) What's the nature, in your experience, of the
contact that must occur before there's a transfer of hair and fiber?

MR. LEONARD: Vague. Calls for speculation.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) How do hair and fiber get exchanged?

A. I mentioned that this type of evidence can be exchanged through
physical contact; that is, the hairs could come out of, off of a
hair-bearing surface, from the hair in the pubic region, from some
other surface, and what actually comes in direct contact with an
object, these hairs could be transferred.

Many times hairs would be deposited on the clothing routinely, as we
go through our normal day. And these hairs then may be deposited onto
an individual many times.

That's what happens in crimes. For instance, we find a sexual assault;
the hairs and fibers that transfer often come right off the clothing
of the individual, but they're from that individual, and you can show
that through a microscopic comparison.

Q. Why do you care?

Why do you spend the time determining whether hairs and fibers have
been transferred or exchanged?

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Vague.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) What's the significance of determining whether and
what types of hairs and fibers have been transferred?

MR. LEONARD: Same objection, Your Honor.

THE COURT: I'm going to sustain the objection.

I don't want to suggest how you should put on your case, but if this
witness is being offered for a specific purpose, it might be more
helpful to establish what this witness did, and then ask the
significance of that examined material with it's relationship to the
case.

MR. MEDVENE: Yes, Your Honor.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) If you're given an adequate hair sample of several
individuals, are you able to differentiate between them?

MR. LEONARD: Same objection.

THE COURT: Sustained.

THE COURT: You're just shooting in the dark at this point, Mr.
Medvene.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Did you, Agent Deedrick, examine certain hairs and
fibers in this case?

A. I did.

Q. And could we step back for a minute.

And could you tell me, what can you tell from a hair analysis?

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Vague.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. MEDVENE: If the Court please, may we approach, Your Honor?

THE COURT: No. My suggestion is, let's put this witness on and hear
what he has to say about what he did 'then you can ask him what the
significance of his findings were.

We don't need a course on -- on hair and fibers at this point. It's
not particularly relevant until we get to some issue.

MR. LEONARD: Your Honor, may we approach?

THE COURT: No.

MR. LEONARD: It's not about this issue.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Can you tell me, Agent Deedrick -- then we'll move
to the items in this case -- where does the FBI Hair and Fiber Unity
receive trace evidence to analyze?

Who sends it to you?

A. Well, local police, state police, FBI field offices, for the most
part; and as I said, we may get evidence from foreign countries, as
well.

Q. Have you -- about how much of your work is -- does the material
come from FBI-related matters and how much from state-related matters?

A. It's close to half, I believe. A little bit more comes from local
and state police.

Q. Do you do some work for foreign governments?

A. We do some work, yes.

Q. What's the nature of your training, education, and background that
led up to your becoming chief of the Hair and Fiber Unit for the
Federal Bureau of Investigation?

A. Well, I came into the FBI in 1972, with a bachelor's degree in
biology from the Indiana University.

When I came on board in 1977 as a trainee, an agent trainee/examiner
in the Hairs and Fibers Unit, there's a year of training under the
supervision of the unit chief and other more experienced examiners.

And then you go through a year of reviewing material, becoming
familiar with the cases that are received, learning how to do -- and
examine hair evidence and fiber evidence, attending schools, both at
the FBI Academy and outside the FBI. And at the end of that year, a
determination is made as to whether you're qualified. That's based on
recommendations of the people in the unit and the unit chief.

Once you start working cases, you gain a lot of experience just by
seeing a pretty broad cross-section of what types of crimes, what
types of evidence come into the laboratory from all around the
country.

And I've worked thousands of cases, testified hundreds of times. I've
just about been in every state, I believe, as far as testimonies go.

I speak at different groups, both at museums, Smithsonian, foreign --
I've spoken at a number of different foreign societies regarding hair
and fiber evidence. So all of that is part of the learning process,
keeping up the literature 2:53PM 11/12/96

Q. Are you involved in any training program with the FBI for hair and
fiber exam?

A. Yeah. For a long time, now, I've been the training coordinator in
the unit, so I'm responsible for designing the training program,
seeing that all the new people that we hire get through the program,
or make a determination about their expertise, kind of do the same
thing that my unit chief did for me when I was going through.

Q. And are there certain proficiency tests that are taken by you and
other hair examiners?

A. Yes.

Q. And what's the nature of the testing?

A. Well, there's internal open testing, and there's external testing.

We get external tests, some corroborative testing services. We also
get external tests from other groups outside. Most of the tests we've
had external have come from foreign countries, working in
collaboration with us.

Q. What is the nature of the test?

What are the tests attempting to determine?

A. Well, whether or not you can identify something properly and
compare it properly. Could be a hair, could be a fiber.

Q. In testimony of the way you work the Bureau, before testimony is
presented such as you're going to present today, is it just your
opinion, or is there any second check?

MR. LEONARD: Objection. That calls for hearsay.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: No. All hair matches, hair associations are confirmed by
another examiner independently before they go out.

Q. Was that done in this case?

A. Yes.

Q. And how about fiber matches or fiber associations?

A. All fiber associations are confirmed, most of the time with
instrumental techniques. With fibers, you're able to use an infrared
spectroscopy, a microspectrophotometry. You can use a number of
techniques to confirm an identification and a comparison. So those are
the tests that are used for that purpose.

Q. Now, in the case involving Mr. Simpson, did there come a time that
you became involved in doing any work in connection with the People of
the State of California versus Mr. Simpson?

A. Yes.

Q. And when were you first assigned to the case?

A. Well, I guess when the evidence first came in? Some evidence was
first submitted to our laboratory in August of 1994.

It was delivered by Susan Brockbank, from the LAPD crime lab.

Q. As time went on, did you receive other material?

A. Yes, there were a number of submissions of evidence from -- at
different times after that.

Q. Could you summarize for me the material you received, the hair and
fiber evidence that you received relative to what you're going to
testify about today.

A. Well, the first evidence submission consisted primarily of debris
packets; that is, debris that had been collected by the police
department crime laboratory from different items of clothing and from
different items.

This would have been from the crime scene, 875 Bundy and 360
Rockingham, as well as there was some other items that were submitted.

And we also received some hair samples, head-hair samples from Nicole
Brown Simpson, Ron Goldman, and also from O.J. Simpson.

The second batch of evidence that came in consisted of carpet samples
from the Bronco. There were a number of other submissions, including
some clothing items, as well

Q. Now, you've referred to debris packets, having received them. What
are debris packets?

A. Well, it's a paper, full, that contains hairs, fibers, and other
material that's been processed off of an item of evidence; could be a
shirt or pair of pants. And it's folded up and put into a small
envelope for preservation, and it could be examined -- a lot of times
it's examined by a crime lab, after they collect all of the evidence.

In this case, they brought it to me and I opened it there in the FBI
lab.

Q. Now, when you first receive the debris packets, do you inventory
them or account for them in some particular way?

A. Right. Each of the items -- each questioned item and the known
items are given a Q number, and just start numerically, start with
Q-1. That's the first item you look at with the corresponding
identifier that's provided by the police department. And all known
items are just given Ks; we know where they came from. Head hair
samples would be Ks; carpet samples would be Ks. All question items
would be given Qs.

Q. Q for question, K for known?

A. Right.

Q. And after you -- and the known items you had to work with were
what?

A. Well, initially they were the head-hair samples from Ron Goldman,
Nicole Brown Simpson, O.J. Simpson, and also the carpet samples. Those
are the first few that we got.

I also received some fabric samples from Nicole Brown Simpson's dress
and from the clothing of Ron Goldman.

Q. Now, after you received the items that you've told us about, what
did you do with them?

A. Well, debris packets are opened individually, and hair evidence,
fiber evidence is monitored on a glass microscope slide. All the known
samples, kind of same thing: You open them up, you mount up a
representative sample, or you mount -- name out all of the hairs that
are found on the sample on separate glass slides.

Each slide is given the corresponding K or Q designations, so you
don't mix them up.

When I say "mounts on a slide," a slide is a glass microscope slide is
one by three inches, and you put the hair or fiber on the surface of
the slide and you add a material to it. It's like a glue; it's called
Permounts. It's a permanent fixture.

From that slide, then you conduct your microscopic analysis.

Q. Now, what specific items that you're going to testify about today,
or today and tomorrow, did you receive for analysis?

A. Well, I received debris packets from a knit hat at Bundy, a glove
found at Bundy, some debris packets from the clothing submitted from
the victims at Bundy.

There were some items that were recovered. There was an item recovered
at O.J. Simpson's residence, I believe a pair of socks; and also,
there was a glove that was recovered. Those items came in as debris
packets.

And I've already mentioned the known hairs. There was some dog hair
samples, as well, and a few other things.

Q. You received some clothing?

A. Well, the clothing -- the only clothing that I received, the first
time was the knit hat that was found at Bundy.

Later on, I received some other items, and I also looked at some of
the items at the Los Angeles Police Department crime lab.

Q. Now, did you have occasion to examine any hair samples?

A. Yes.

Q. And you said you were sent certain known hair samples?

A. Right, from the two victims and a suspect.

Q. Okay.

Can you tell us, related to this case, not generally, but what did you
do with regard to those three known hair samples you received?

Can you go through the procedure and why you did it?

A. Each of the known hair samples is characterized. That is, the
description of the characteristics is written down. And I do that to
determine the range of characteristics of that known sample. I do that
with each of the samples, take some notes, and using that as a basis
of record, then conduct my analysis.

And then the analysis conducted through the microscope notes are there
just for me to identify some of these characteristics, just -- and
also to note the range, because not all the hairs are identical to
each other. There's a range of characteristics that we have and these
hairs had, as well.

Q. And with respect to the known hairs you received, how did you
examine the microscopic characteristics?

A. It's examined with a research microscope.

And again, the hairs are mounted on the slides, and you look at them
under the microscope at magnifications anywhere from 400X -- we go up
to about 450X on our microscopes.

Q. What does that mean, 400X or 450X?

A. 40 (sic) times the actual items, or 450 times the actual size, by
focusing up and down through the hair. It's called an optical
cross-section. You can actually look through the hair because of the
light transmitted through the base of the microscope.

And then the hairs are characterized. You just describe them.

Q. In the hairs you looked at, the known sample of Ms. Brown, the
known sample of Mr. Simpson, the known sample of Mr. Goldman, what are
the things you're looking for in terms of differentiating those hairs?

A. Well, it's possible to determine, first of all racial origin, such
as there are three main racial groups that we work with: Caucasian,
Negroid and Mongoloid, Mongoloid being Asians; Negroid, African
persons, would be an example. Caucasians, there's a lot of varieties
of Caucasian people.

Each racial group exhibits characteristics. It's possible to determine
the part of the body the hair came from. I would look at that. I know
they were head hairs, so that wasn't a question. If there's damage, if
there's disease, if there's treatment, if the hairs fill out
naturally, if hairs are forcibly removed. All of these things can be
determined from each of the samples.

There are a number of microscopic characterizations that I used.
They're internal in the hair and they're found throughout the length.

There's an outer layer called the cuticle. It's made up of scales;
they overlap like the shingles on a roof towards the end, and they may
protrude a little bit; they may lay very close; they may be very
thick, sometimes very thin.

Asians have very thick cuticles, but Caucasians sometimes have very
thin.

The cortex is just underneath. It's like the wood of a pencil, if you
think of the paint being the cuticle and the wood being the cortex.
Most of the hair is the cortex. Hair is a long cylinder of different
lengths; so it's three-dimensional.

This cortex has pigment in it, pigment granules to give it color. They
can be distributed different ways. I look at how the pigment is
distributed in each of the known samples. Some of the hair has air
spaces; they're air spaces. They're called cortical fusi F-U-S-I.

And you also may have ovoid bodies, which are big, brown footballs --
if you think of footballs; it's what they look like inside the hair --
of different sizes and shapes.

And the distribution of all these characteristics, whether or not
they're present, how much they're present, how dense they are, all of
these things were compared in all three of these samples.

First of all, we had one individual of Negroid origin, and we had two
Caucasian individuals.

So it was easy to distinguish those hair samples. The colors were
completely different, lengths were different, characteristics were
different. No question about being able to distinguish these -- these
samples, which is routine for any two samples that I get in.

Q. Have you encountered a situation where you haven't been able to
distinguish between two samples you received?

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Relevance.

THE COURT: In this case?

MR. MEDVENE: In this case.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: In this case, it was -- it was not difficult to
distinguish samples. And that's been the case ever since I've been
there.

MR. LEONARD: Move to strike.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Now, when you examined the known hair samples of
Mr. Goldman, Nicole Brown Simpson, and Mr. Simpson, were you able to
tell the differences between those samples?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, you told us you received -- I want to just talk about -- we'll
continue talking just about hair, and then we'll go to fiber later.

You told us you received certain hair and fiber that was removed from
items of evidence at the crime scene at Bundy and at Rockingham. And I
want to start now talking about the hair, fiber, and other debris
removed from Ron Goldman's shirt.

And did you examine that debris?

A. I did, yes.

Q. And did you get that from the LA Police Department?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Did you collect any yourself?

A. I did, yes.

Q. And how did you do that?

A. Well, I collected that at the crime lab.

I happened to be in Los Angeles -- and again, I may have been at
pretrial -- pretrial or some other trip that I was on -- happened to
stop in and I asked to take a look at the evidence, if that was
possible.

In looking at the shirt, which was Ron Goldman's shirt, I determined
that, you know, it might be a good idea, if possible, to reprocess it,
because it appears to me there were some hairs and fibers on it that
hadn't been removed.

And they agreed and I went ahead and processed it.

Q. When you examined the debris from Mr. Goldman's shirt, did you find
any hairs on that shirt?

A. Yes.

Q. And what general types of hair did you find on the shirt?

A. I don't know if I quite understand the question. You're referring
to all the items from the shirt that I received, including the debris
packets?

Q. I just wanted to focus, if I could, on whether or not you were able
to identify at least three different kinds of hair.

MR. LEONARD: Your Honor, I have an objection as vague, as to on what
occasion, whether it was from the debris packet or from the occasion
on which Agent Deedrick personally did some reprocessing. And I think
he has a problem with it, too.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. Okay. Most of the hairs that I examined from the shirt were from
the debris packet. That was the material that was examined by the
police department originally and then packaged in the paper fold and
then submitted to me for analysis.

In the debris packet there were three different types of hairs found;
couple different types of Caucasian hairs and one hair of Negroid
origin. There was also some Negroid limb hairs found on that shirt.

Q. At my request did you prepare a chart?

A. I did.

Q. And what information did you put on the chart?

A. Well, the chart listed some items across the top which included
items taken from the Bundy crime scene which would have been Ron
Goldman's shirt, a hat and a glove and from Rockingham location would
have been a glove and a pair of socks.

Q. Would you mind approaching the chart if you would and removing the
paper and tell us what's that represent. Are these the items that
you're going to testify about?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

(Witness approaches board.)

Q. 2169, Your Honor.

(The instrument herein referred to as a chart by Douglas Deedrick was
marked for identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 2169.)

Q. Again at the top of this chart, are those the items over the next
several hours you're going to discuss?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay. Now, you said you found certain hairs, three different types,
two Caucasian, one Negroid and one Negroid limb hair, could you put
that on the chart.

(Witness complies writes on chart.)

MR. LEONARD: Your Honor, may I move over to this side.

Q. Now, by putting what you put under the heading Ron Goldman's shirt,
what were you meaning to convey, what information?

A. Well, that these are the types of hairs that were found on that --
on the shirt from processing the shirt.

Q. Now, can you generally describe what HH stands for what?

A. Head hair.

Q. Can you generally describe the two types of Caucasian head hair
that you found on Mr. Goldman's shirt?

A. Most of the hairs were long perhaps up to a foot in length. There
was about 35 of them all forcibly removed. There were a number of
short cut hairs that were darker Caucasian those were the two
Caucasian types of hair that were found.

Q. Did you have occasion to compare those hairs with any known hairs?

A. I did, yes.

Q. And what known hairs did you compare them with?

A. Okay. I compared all the head hairs Caucasian hairs with the two
white individuals Nicole Brown Simpson, Ron Goldman a Negroid head
hair was compared that with O.J. Simpson initially.

Q. And what kind of examination -- strike that.

Did you perform the same or different examinations in terms of your
comparison of all the hairs you've told us about?

A. Well, the comparison process is the same. I mean, you take it and
you compare it under a comparison microscope.

Q. And did you reach any conclusions when you compared the known hairs
with the question hairs?

A. I did.

Q. And what conclusions did you reach?

A. Well, most --

Q. We're talking about the Caucasian hairs?

A. This is the Caucasian hairs.

Most of the hairs that came off the shirt matched with Nicole Brown
Simpson's head hair. That would have been all the forcibly removed
hairs, the lighter blond, treated-type hairs.

Q. Can you put that on the board in the appropriate place.

(Witness complies.)

Q. Do you recall the proximate number of hairs that you found of
Nicole Brown Simpson's, related to Mr. Goldman's shirt?

A. Yeah. There was about 35.

Q. And could you tell from looking at the hairs, how they had been --
how they the been removed?

A. Well, some were cut, some were broken, and some actually had the
root present, and it had been pulled out of the scalp.

Q. When you say "cut" what do you mean, "cut?"

A. Well --

Q. You mean with an instrument?

A. Yes.

Q. Such as?

A. Knife, scissors. They were cut.

Q. Now, how many of Mr. Goldman's hairs did you find?

A. Well, there were a number. I don't recall the exact number, I mean,
in terms of the question hairs. I compared the other questioned hairs
with Mr. Goldman's known hairs, and they matched up with Mr. Goldman.
They were found on his own shirt.

You want me to write Ron Goldman?

Q. Yes.

(Witness complies, writes on chart.)

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Can you tell how Mr. Goldman's hairs came out,
naturally or some other way?

A. No, they were cut. They were cut.

Q. Again, with an instrument like a knife?

A. A pretty sharp cut. It would have been consistent with an item like
a knife, as opposed to scissors, because they were both cut and torn.

Q. Does it affect your conclusion at all -- strike that.

Does it affect your conclusion at all, certain of the hairs found were
microscopically similar to Nicole Brown and certain microscopically
similar to Ron Goldman's?

In Nicole Brown's case, you had 35 hairs?

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Vague as to conclusion. I'm not sure which
conclusion he's talking about.

THE COURT: I'll sustain the objection on the grounds that the question
is unintelligible.

MR. MEDVENE: All right, sir.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) When you compared Nicole Brown's hairs with the
known sample, what is the significance, if any, you had 35 of her
hairs found on the shirt?

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Vague.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Now, you could ask this witness about transfers.

MR. MEDVENE: All right, sir.

THE COURT: You can lay a foundation as to transfers.

MR. MEDVENE: Thank you, Your Honor.

THE WITNESS: With regards to the number of hairs, each hair has
certain characteristics. I mentioned a range of characteristics.

You have 35 independent comparisons that you make. The fact that you
have 35, you've got two people laying next to each other, dead. In all
likelihood, they're her hairs. You don't have to be a microscopist to
make that determination. You could, if you want to make a scientific,
valid analysis.

In this case, they looked the same. They should have been there in
that location. And that would have been my opinion: They're probably
hers.

Q. In your opinion -- you were discussing primary and secondary
transfer before.

What is your opinion of how Ms. Brown's head hair gets on Mr.
Goldman's shirt?

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Calls for speculation; lack of foundation.

THE COURT: Sustained.

You may inquire of this witness what those terms are and what possible
application they might have to this case.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Could you tell us what primary transfer is and
secondary transfer.

And tell us, if you would, what application those principles have to
this situation of Ms. Brown's hair being found on Mr. Goldman's shirt.

MR. LEONARD: Same objection, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: Okay. We have about 100 hairs, they say, shed every day,
each of us do. And we grow new ones, most of us, and some don't grow
back. But about 100 a day. So you're going to have primary transfers
onto your own clothes; you have primary transfers if you rub your head
against somebody, and hairs could get transferred that way.

Many times, hairs will move as a result -- as I mentioned before,
secondary transfer.

In this particular case, you have 35 hairs. If the hairs were clenched
in the hand of Ron Goldman, for instance, I might think that that is a
primary transfer.

The fact that we have a movement in -- and these people are separated
-- either they came out just forcibly onto his clothes during a
struggle between these two people, or some intermediary came in
between and transferred it as a result of secondary transfer. So I
would suspect secondary.

Q. By transfer as a result of secondary transfer, how would that
happen?

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Vague, lack of foundation.

THE COURT: Overruled.

You may explain secondary transfer.

THE WITNESS: As when I mentioned secondary transfer, they had to have
come off her head through some other intermediary, some other object.
In this case, the person that may have been involved in killing the
two individuals.

MR. LEONARD: Your Honor, I move to strike as speculative, the last
statement.

THE COURT: Overruled.

That's an explanation of secondary transfers.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Now, you've told us about matching the Caucasian
hairs of Ms. Brown, Mr. Goldman, as being on his shirt. You also
mentioned that you found certain Negroid hairs.

Well, let me -- let me do it this way. And I'm sorry.

We were talking about Nicole Brown's hairs.

Did you find head hairs matching hers on any of the other items that
you have on your chart?

A. I did.

Q. Where?

A. Well, they would have been all the way across, except for the
Rockingham socks, on the Bundy glove, Bundy hat, the Rockingham glove.
All of those had hairs like hers.

Q. Can you put that on the chart.

A. How about if I put -- should I put an arrow?

Q. Yes; that's fine.

(Witness marks chart with arrow.)

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Now, can you tell us again, in talking about
primary and secondary transfer, your opinion of whether there was a
primary other or secondary transfer which caused Ms. Brown's hair to
be on the Bundy glove and the Bundy hat the and the Rockingham glove.

MR. LEONARD: Your Honor, that's compound, calls for speculation, lack
of foundation.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: Well, there's no way to know precisely here, except that
we're talking about gloves which are worn on hands. Those could have
been the result of primary transfer.

The Bundy glove, for instance, was found on the ground in an area
where she was. So if her hairs had been deposited onto the ground and
the glove landed on these hairs, it would -- it could have been a
secondary transfer.

On the Bundy hat, again, it could have been either: Could have been a
primary transfer or a secondary transfer. Again, the hat on the
ground, as well.

The Rockingham glove, that could have -- could be either, to tell you
the truth.

Q. Did you prepare a board depicting the microscopic characteristics
of the head hairs that you found on items of evidence and that you
matched to Nicole Brown's known hairs?

A. I did.

Q. We would put up now what's been marked 520.

(The instrument herein referred to as Chart entitled Known Head Hairs
of Nicole Brown Simpson was marked for identification as Plaintiffs'
Exhibit No. 520.)

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) I put on the board what's marked as 520, and ask
you if you prepared or caused that exhibit to be prepared?

A. I did.

Q. And could you please explain to the jury what it is.

A. Well, these are photographs, each one taken about 250 times
magnification, of known head hairs, which are across the top. These
would have been the known head hairs of Nicole Brown Simpson.

The question hairs were also photographed, same magnification, same
microscope camera, setup of hairs from different items.

Q-1, the first item I looked at in this case, was from debris from the
Rockingham glove.

Q-7b, just one of the debris packets, which was a hair in the glove
from Bundy.

Same from the one next to it on the right on Q-23, that's one of the
hairs that came from Ron Goldman's shirt.

Ron Goldman's shirt debris packet was number Q-23.

And over on the far right, both top and bottom just represent what a
hair looks like forcibly removed. The bottom, one being one of the
hairs that came off of Ron Goldman's shirt, the top one being one of
the known hairs that were pulled out of the head of Nicole Brown
Simpson.

And the photographs that I displayed here kind of correspond top to
bottom, if you go across the board.

The Q-1 hair, which is found at -- on the Rockingham glove, was about
12 inches, 10, 12 inches, something like that, had been forcibly
removed. That was on the Rockingham glove.

This Q hair, again, a little bit lighter because she had her hair
treated; it was like treated or frosted. There was some change in the
color along the length, so as you went out near the end, it seemed to
get lighter.

This is another hair, a lighter hair that matched up with one of her
hairs.

And then this is probably a distal fragment, distal being the furthest
out, away from the head, and it's by far the most bleached out.

Q-23 had a lot of hairs that work with Q-23 -- I mentioned I had about
35 hairs all together. And this -- I think this represents -- gives
you an idea of the range. You see a range of characteristics of an
individual.

MR. LEONARD: Your Honor, may I ask what the magnification is?

THE COURT: I think he testified to that.

MR. LEONARD: I'm sorry?

THE WITNESS: Yeah. It's 250.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Did you take the photographs on the chart?

A. I did.

Q. And how do you go about taking them?

A. Well, you put the hair under -- on the slide underneath the
microscope, just like you're looking at it, and you have a camera
that's sitting up on the top. You can actually look at the hair and
photograph at the same time, if you want to. And the camera, as the
focal point, it's set focus on the same material that you're looking
at through the eyepieces, and you push a button and there's an
automatic camera system that does the work for you.

Q. So there are pictures of hair under a microscope under what
magnification?

A. 250.

Q. Do the pictures depict what you're actually seeing when you look
through the microscope?

A. It's right on track. There's not a whole lot of difference.

Q. Do the six photographs across the top depict all of the known hairs
that you determined match the head hair recovered from Mr. Goldman's
shirt, the Bundy glove, the Bundy hat, and the Rockingham glove?

A. Yes.

Q. How did you select the six photos of Nicole Brown's known head
hairs to place on the chart of all the ones you have?

A. It's just random, just pick a representative sample.

Q. When you looked at the hairs, did you examine the whole length of
the hair?

A. Yes.

Q. And are the photographs of the whole length or some portion of the
hair?

A. Well, it's just a portion, and it's two-dimensional.

Keep that in mind, I mentioned before, the hairs are cylindrical.
They're actually three-dimensional. We're capturing just a
two-dimensional, very short segment of her hair.

Q. Now, if you look at the chart comparing the hairs found on the
Bundy glove that's depicted, I think, on the fourth photograph from
the left on the bottom row, that appears to be lighter than the other
hairs in that row, does it not?

A. Right. I mentioned that it's probably been bleached.

Q. Okay.

Can you tell, Agent Deedrick, in looking at any of the photos of the
hair, whether it appears any have been forcibly removed?

A. Well, yes. I mentioned that the one on the far right, which is just
one of them, an example of one of the roots that came off of the
debris packet from Ron Goldman's shirt.

Q. And what appears on the hair, as far as your opinion is concerned?

A. Well, looks like blood.

Q. And what would account for the blood being on the hair?

A. Well, the known sample -- she -- I understand she was bleeding, so
that would be a good source of the hair -- the question hair on Q-23.
That blood was not tested, but it could be from either bleeding
individual.

(Witness reassumes witness stand.)

(Counsel displays chart created by Mr. Deedrick containing hair
samples.)

Q. Now, you told us, I believe, earlier, that you had found two types
of Caucasian hair on Mr. Goldman's shirt, and you've told us that one
matched Nicole Brown Simpson.

Did you attempt to make a determination whether you could find a match
or nonmatch for the other hair?

A. Well, on Ron Goldman, the hair -- the question hair, on Ron
Goldman's hair, I compared that with Ron Goldman's known hairs. I
mentioned that they exhibited the same characteristics as his.

Q. Now, did you find his hair on any of the other items that are on
the chart?

A. I found -- I found some hairs on the Rockingham glove, head hairs,
both cut and torn at the proximal end, and that would be the end
nearest the root. They were found on the Rockingham glove debris.

Q. Would you mind putting that on the chart.

(Witness complies, marks chart.)

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) And could you tell us again, utilizing the
definition you previously gave us of primary and secondary transfer,
how, in your opinion, you would account for Mr. Goldman's hair being
on the Rockingham glove.

A. Well, there's no way to know precisely how that happened. Again, as
the glove on the hand possible primary. You can't rule out secondary.

Q. When you say "possible primary," what is possible?

MR. LEONARD: Calls for speculation, based on his last answer.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: It could have been directly from contact, from contact
with the glove with the head, or it could have been contact the glove
with the shirt. That had cut hairs on it, as well. That would be a
secondary transfer, a close secondary.

Q. And the glove being deposited at Rockingham?

A. Right.

Q. Can you, if you wouldn't mind, on Nicole Brown to maybe under the
Bundy glove, Bundy hat, and Rockingham glove. Instead of an arrow, put
NBS, just so it will be a little clearer.

(Witness complies.)

Q. Did you prepare a chart depicting the microscopic characteristic of
the hair you found on Mr. Goldman's shirt and the Rockingham glove
showing why, in your opinion, it matched the known hair of Mr.
Goldman?

A. I prepared a chart.

Q. I'm going to place before you what's been marked 521, chart
entitled known head hairs from Ronald Goldman, head hair from
Goldman's shirt.

(The instrument herein referred to as chart entitled "Known Head Hairs
from Ronald Goldman" was marked for identification as Plaintiffs'
Exhibit No. 521.)

Q. When you say you prepared a chart, can you tell us in summary
fashion, did you go through the same steps you previously described in
analyzing hair before you got to the stage of taking the pictures?

A. The whole process from start to finish is the same. Any time you do
a hair comparison, you follow the same procedures.

Q. And the procedure again, quickly, so I know we have it is?

A. You put on a slide. You examine it, identify the type of hair, the
race, the body area, whether it's suitable for comparison or not and
then compare it with a known standard.

Now the comparison, I didn't really go into this. With a comparison
microscope, there are two microscopes connected by an optical bridge.
It allows you to look into the eye pieces and see both hairs at the
same time. So the determination as to whether or not they look the
same or they look different, is based on an actual view of both hairs
at the same time.

You can compare them all the way up and down the length of the hair at
the same time. They're all mechanical stages.

Q. And once that's done, then the determination of taking a
photograph, the way the photographs are done, again, to clarify that
is the camera is set up. There are little knobs at the top of this
bridge and you can kind of change which side you want to take the
picture of, left or right.

So when I put the known hairs on the right side, the question hairs on
the left side, and then when I get it to where I want to demonstrate
how these hairs look best, then I would shut off one side and
photograph the question; shut that side off, open the other and
photograph the knowns. So you get an idea of what I'm saying. What I
say, I'm making a comparison while I'm looking at, are these two
things in the same field of view.

Q. By these two things, you're pointing at?

A. Well, the head hairs. The question hair and the known head hair.

Q. Going to put on the TV monitor what's been marked as exhibit 503
that's right behind you.

(The instrument herein referred to as A Chart of Microscopic
Comparision of Hairs was marked for identification as Plaintiffs'
Exhibit No. 503.)

Q. Can you tell us what that chart depicts in terms of what you've
been telling us about?

A. It's kind of the same idea in graphic form where you have the
circle representing your field of view. It goes off the field just a
little bit. It's not really exact because it would actually be shown
inside this circle there.

Q. This lines represents a split screen, question hair on one side,
known hair on the other side. What you try to do when you're doing the
hair comparison, the best comparison you can come up with, like a
mirror.

A. And -- but actually it looks like one hair down the whole length,
from question side to known side to compare all the characteristics;
the cuticle, the cortex the gray area cuticle, not brown. It's for
illustrative purposes.

Most of the time it's clear. If it has dye, it could be colored. These
little footballs I mentioned before ovoid bodies. You may have air
spaces, which are -- this is -- it's hard to see, but these other
things might be pigment granules, those small dots.

Q. Now, could you go through what's marked 521 for us and tell the
jury why you found that there was a match between the hairs of Mr.
Goldman that you found on the Rockingham glove and his known hairs?

A. Okay. With regard to the Rockingham glove, the hairs that you see,
there's a little bit of a range characteristic. I mentioned before
about primary transfers and secondary transfers. An example might be
the Rockingham glove hair here. This is one of the hairs taken from
his shirt, very similar.

It might have been a secondary transfer.

The more amber-colored hair, a little bit different -- difference in
diameter, very similar characteristics.

Again, hairs may vary a little bit as to their thickness. Some are a
little thicker than others and also might be the orientation. Cause,
you know, you're looking at hair laying on the slide. It's moving
around. It may turn a little bit on side. This hair lined up pretty
well.

As you can see, there is -- there is medullation, which is dark. It
has air surrounding, when you're looking at it through the microscope,
it looks opaque or dark here. The medullation is clear or broken up a
little bit.

Medullation or the medulla in the center -- in the center canal, like
the lead of a pencil, is in different forms, cuticle difference. I
think you can see the cuticle a little bit. You may have a better look
later. It says, "clear layer, outside cortex" here. Pigmentation a
little bit to one side, sort of patchy; a little bit patchy. It looks
like little cloudy areas. You may see some of the air spaces, air
bubbles that are found in a hair shaft. It's just a comparison of all
the characteristics. We're just picking out one area here to
photograph.

Q. And did you have more known samples of Mr. Goldman's hair than
you've put on the board?

A. I did. There were a lot of hairs from him.

Q. And why did you decide to put the ones you put up?

A. Well, just to represent the hair association. It was selection.

MR. LEONARD: That's 250 as well?

THE WITNESS: 250.

MR. LEONARD: Okay.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Again, as on the chart with Ms. Brown's hair, did
you look at the entire length of the hair in doing your examination.

A. They were shorter, they're shorter hairs. Especially the hairs, the
question hairs. They were taken from the shirt and from the -- from
the Rockingham glove. They were cut and torn shorter fragments of
hair.

Q. Now, you mentioned that you also found some Negroid limb hair on
Mr. Goldman's shirt.

THE COURT: All right. Before you get into that, ten minutes, ladies
and gentlemen.

Don't talk about the case. Don't form or express any opinions. Direct
the jury back in ten minutes.

(Recess.)

(Jurors resume their respective seats.)

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) When you say, Agent Deedrick, in discussing with
us the matching between Nicole Brown Simpson known hairs and the
question hairs, you've described Mr. Goldman's known hairs and
question hairs, what is it that you're determining when you say
there's a match or whatever word you feel is appropriate to use?

A. Well, when a question hair is matched to a known hair sample, we
say it exhibits the same microscopic characteristics and is consistent
with having originated from that person.

Hair examinations are not to the point where you can say absolutely
that this hair came from the person. The known hairs, we know that.
That's why we call them "K" or knowns.

But with question hairs, we don't say absolutely. We never have. And
we also qualify that in our reports that they're not an absolute form
of identification.

Q. And even though you say, as you've just told us, that it's not an
absolute form of identification, then what, in your opinion, is the
significance of the findings that you make when you use the term
"match."

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Vague.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: Well, with regards to hairs, what I found, through my
experience of looking at hairs through 19 years now, is it's unusual
to find two people that have hairs that exhibit the same microscopic
characteristics. I have reasonable doubt, no difficulty in
distinguishing one hair sample from the next hair sample because of
the variety that's out there. It makes -- it's very significant, in my
opinion, when you can associate or match a hair, a questioned hair
with a known hair sample. 'Cause it's just not going to match just
anybody chosen at random out of the population.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) How many known hair samples have you examined over
your career?

A. Well, at least.

MR. LEONARD: Irrelevant.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: At least 10,000, probably more.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) And has there ever been a case where you haven't
been able to differentiate between the known sample from the victim
and the sample from the suspect?

MR. LEONARD: Your Honor, that is vague and it's irrelevant.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) We had started talking about Negroid limb hair.
You told us earlier that you found certain Negroid limb hair on Mr.
Goldman's shirt; is that correct?

A. That's right.

Q. Going back to the chart, did you find Negroid limb hairs on any
other items of evidence that are listed on the chart?

A. On the Rockingham glove.

Q. Would you mind writing that on the chart?

(Witness complies. Writes on Exhibit 2169.)

Q. Can you describe for us, the type of examination that you conducted
to reach your conclusion that there were Negroid limb hairs on Mr.
Goldman's shirt and on the Rockingham glove?

A. Well, it's simply a microscopic identification. Once the hairs are
on the slide, it's just a matter of looking at it and drawing from
your own experience. As I mentioned before, it's possible to
distinguish different hairs in different body areas.

Q. Is it possible to associate these hairs with a specific individual?

A. No.

Q. Why is that?

A. Well, limb hairs are not as good as head hairs and pubic hairs for
association purposes. What we're saying is that these limb hairs, arm
hairs or leg hairs originated from a Negroid individual. I didn't
compare these two hairs together. And if I did, it would not mean as
much as a head hair or pubic hair.

Q. And again, it wouldn't mean as much because?

A. It wouldn't mean as much simply because they don't suppose enough
individual characteristics like head hairs and pubic hairs do for
individualization.

Q. Now, you told us earlier that you found certain Negroid head hairs
on Mr. Goldman's shirt; is that correct?

A. Right. There was one Negroid head hair.

Q. Did you compare that head hair with the known head hair of Mr.
Simpson?

A. I did, yes.

Q. And what type of comparison did you make?

A. Same type comparison, with a comparison microscope.

Q. And based on your examination, what did you conclude?

A. Well, that one hair matched the known hairs of O.J. O.J. Simpson,
four head hairs.

Q. And when you -- when you say it matched, what do you base that on?

A. No significant differences. They looked the same microscopically.

Q. Would you put that on the chart, please?

(Witness marks on chart.)

Q. Excuse me, Agent Deedrick, under the Rockingham glove its says
COHH. What did that stand for?

A. That's Caucasian origin. It's kind of a short hand.

Q. And the HH?

A. Head hair. Negroid would be NO and Mongoloid, MO just for
expediency.

Q. Now, with respect to the other items of evidence listed on the
chart, did you find any Negroid head hair that matched Mr. Simpson's?

A. I did.

Q. And on which item?

A. It would have been the Bundy hat.

Q. Would you mind putting that down, please?

(Witness marks chart.)

Q. Now, using the primary and secondary methods of transfer that
you've talked to us about before, based on your expertise, can you
give us an opinion as to how those head hairs were deposited on Mr.
Goldman's shirt, first off.

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Lack of foundation. Calls for speculation.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: There was only one, and again, one head hair that was
found on Ron Goldman's shirt. And again, that could have been the
result of actual physical contact with a body that had a hair on the
surface of the clothes or it could have been directly as the head
making contact with -- With the clothing; with the shirt. It could
have been either.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) And how about your finding that -- How many head
hairs on the Bundy hat that matched Mr. Simpson?

A. There were 12.

Q. And then, your opinion of how those head hairs might have been
deposited on the Bundy hat --

MR. LEONARD: Same objection.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: Well, it depends on where you get hairs on hats. To reach
that conclusion in this case, most of the hairs came from inside the
hat which suggests primary transfer.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) What does that mean in that case, say, primary
transfer.

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Vague.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: Well, it means that either O.J. Simpson wore the hat or
somebody else who had hairs that exhibit the same individual
microscopic characteristics. That's what that means.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Now, have you ever found a case in the 10,000 you
examined, where party A had the same microscopic characteristics of
head hair as party B?

MR. LEONARD: Your Honor, lack of foundation. Irrelevant and vague.

THE COURT: Sustained as to the last.

MR. MEDVENE: Sustained.

THE COURT: Sustained as to vagueness "party A and -- A and party B."

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Have you ever encountered a situation in the
10,000 odd that you've examined, where the head hairs from one
individual matched microscopically with the head hairs of another
individual?

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Same objections, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: In all the cases I've worked, I've never had a problem. I
think I mentioned this of -- about, I never really had a problem
distinguishing the known hairs from individuals in the case.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Now, you said on the Bundy hat you found 12 head
hairs that matched Mr. Simpson's. Do you recall where you found them?

A. Well, I mentioned -- I mentioned about, I think there were about
nine inside -- inside the hat. The others were found on the outside of
the hat. Two of the hairs I removed myself.

Q. And where did you remove them from?

A. I -- they were removed from the inside -- they actually had
entwined themselves into the fabric yarn of the hat.

MR. LEONARD: Your Honor, I'm going to object and move to strike on the
basis that he just testified he only removed two himself. He can't
know where the other ones were removed from. There's a lack of
foundation.

THE COURT: Lay a foundation as to the other seven.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) With respect to the head hairs, other than the two
that you found embedded inside the hat, where were they found?

MR. LEONARD: Same objection.

THE COURT: Foundation. Overruled.

A. I would have to base that on the information provided to me by the
police department, debris packets. And on the debris packets, they
indicate --

MR. LEONARD: Your Honor, calls for hearsay. Move to strike.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: Look at the debris packet. In the debris packet it was
listed as to exactly where that hair was removed that was in the
packet and I used that as a basis of my statement.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) And where was it removed from?

A. Well, the other 7 --

MR. BAKER: I'm going to object. I'm sorry.

MR. LEONARD: Same Objection, Your Honor. Hearsay.

THE COURT: Overruled. The witness said he read it from the debris
packet.

THE WITNESS: As I said, those other hairs were identified as coming
from the inside of the hat.

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Now, is there any significance, as an expert in
this area, in the fact that two of the hairs matching Mr. Simpson's
were found embedded in the fabric?

A. Well, hairs, from my experience, that are in -- actually embedded
in fabric, are -- it's often the case that they had been there a
while; they just work their way into the fabric. We see that on
blankets, sometimes, as well as other items, knit items.

Q. Is there any greater significance for matching 12 head hairs, as
you did in this case, to a known head hair of Mr. Simpson's, than
there is to matching one questionable head hair to a known sample?

A. Yeah. I think I went into this before a little bit as to
independent individual variables. You have 12 hairs; each one has --
it falls within a range of characteristics of the known standards. You
have 12 independent associations. Obviously, that has more
significance than a single association.

Q. Did you prepare a chart depicting the microscopic characteristics
of the head hairs you found on the Bundy knit hat that you say matched
the known four head hairs of Mr. Simpson?

A. Right. I prepared two charts.

Q. I'm going place on the board, 524.

(The instrument herein referred to as Chart entitled Known Head Hairs
from Orenthal J. Simpson was marked for identification as Plaintiffs'
Exhibit No. 524.)

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Agent Deedrick, would you be good enough to tell
me if you caused that board to be prepared?

A. I did.

Q. And what does it indicate?

A. Well, the top row are photographs of known head hairs that were
taken from the head of O.J. Simpson. And the bottom row are hairs that
are questioned hairs taken from, I believe, different areas of the
knit hat.

And I can't see all the way down. If I could step down and take a
look.

Q. Could you?

A. Yeah.

Right. These are all from from the knit hat, different hairs that,
again, that I photographed the same way that I photographed the top
hairs. I have them lined up as best I could as to give you an idea of
the range of characteristics and how some of the associations that I
was looking at would be represented, as to the pigmentation, the
distribution of the pigment, coloration, the fineness of the hair, the
thickness of the hair, things of that nature.

Q. Could you take us through the chart, if you would, and explain to
the jury why you feel the particular K numbers are known Mr. Simpson
hair matches, the particular Q numbers that you have on the chart.

A. Okay. Again, it would be just from describing some of the
characteristics that I was looking at, the hair samples, most of the
hairs that I -- that I -- in fact, almost all of the hair samples I
got from Mr. Simpson, I had a brownish coloration they're a little bit
different than what I typically find in hairs of Negroid origin. They
tend to be a little darker. And little heavier clumping pigmentation
often makes the hair almost opaque they're very easy to see, very
distinctive, one-sided pigmentation. Some of the pictures show that
patches in the pigmentation that you see.

Again, you see it here on this side; this hair is a little more
gray-brown. And again, it ranges in thicknesses from some of the finer
hairs and some of the thicker hairs, just gives you an idea of what I
compared.

Q. And why did you pick these particular known hairs?

A. It's just a selection based on what I was looking at to demonstrate
similarities of the characteristics.

Q. Can you go through or pick any of the pictures and talk about some
of the particular areas or microscopic characteristics that were
significant to you.

A. Yeah. I think you've already done that pretty much.

The main point of comparison would have been the coloration. And what
you can't see is the shape of the hair. I mean, you kind of see a
little arc to it, but you really don't see the shape of the overall
hair.

That's another key point of comparison, because some hairs of
black-headed individuals are very tightly coiled; others are
relatively separate.

This one, he had more of an S-curve to it, and the same -- both
question hairs and known hairs.

The coloration: I mentioned the pigmentation distribution. Dark hairs
illustrate this very well. There were a number of these, as you can
see, dark pigmentation of the lower portion of the hair; and just
happens, the pigment tends to group itself on one side.

Medullation -- not a lot of medullation. I mean the medulla in the
central canal, that wasn't that obvious.

The thickness of the cuticle, actually, it was relatively fine. It
wasn't real thick.

Protrusion, how the scales protruded away from the cuticle, didn't
really protrude away too much.

Again, that's a another variable used for comparison, protrusion of
cuticle, thickness of cuticle, the delineation or how easy to see the
inner border of the cuticle, which is this outside clear layer, the
size of the pigment granules, and I'll find a medium in size. The
presence or absence of clumping, patching, distribution of the
pigment, ovoid bodies, and fusi, cortical fusi, they were not present
to any significant degree.

Now, another point of comparison I had was the root. Again it doesn't
show it here. I compared the root, as well as the tip of the hair.

Again, two-dimensional. Keep that in mind.

Q. You say two-dimensional as compared with what?

A. Three.

Q. And?

A. The real world.

Q. And the real world is what you're actually seeing and not the
photograph?

A. That's right.

Q. Now, again, the pictures on this chart, did you take them?

A. I did.

Q. Did you prepare another chart of Mr. Simpson's hairs?

A. I did.

Q. The known hairs and also the questioned hairs?

A. Same idea.

MR. MEDVENE: Put on the board 525.

(The instrument herein referred to as Chart of Known Head Hairs of
Orenthal J. Simpson was marked for identification as Plaintiffs'
Exhibit No. 525.)

Q. (BY MR. MEDVENE) Could you go through for us what 525 is.

A. 525. Again, here we have, again, six known hairs that are
photographed on the top portion of the chart. The bottom six are
question hairs. Most of them came from the cap. One of the hairs
originated -- identified as coming from Ron Goldman's shirt. And the
same characteristics and descriptions apply. I don't need to go into
all of those again because distribution of the pigment, the
coloration, the range in characteristics, everything I mentioned
before.

I tried to line them up so they correspond top to bottom. There might
be some variations in some of the thickness in the orientation, and
also again how the photograph was taken. If it looks like it's on the
right side or the left side of that distribution, just how the hair is
laying on the stage when I -- when I took the picture.

Q. Now, you said you found the -- you compared the known hairs of Mr.
Simpson with the questioned hairs from the knit cap and you found
those matched. And certain of the slides relate to that; is that
correct?

A. That's right. Five of the six.

Q. And could you go -- because you've spoken about the other chart,
524, also matched the number of the questioned hairs from the Bundy
cap with the known hairs, right?

A. That's right. That's right.

Q. Now this one also deals with Mr. Goldman's shirt?

A. That's right. So we have 11 and one -- essentially, 11 from the
cap, one from the shirt.

Q. Could you -- we've talked about the match between Mr. Simpson's
hair and the hairs found on knit cap.

Could you go through a little bit of detail for us with respect to the
shirt.

Why did you feel that the -- why was it your expert opinion that Mr.
Simpson's known hair matched the hair on Mr. Goldman's shirt.

A. Well, when I say the hair matched the known hairs, the exhibit, the
same microscopic characteristics, I put them side by side, they
appeared the same in all respects. If I saw something significantly
different, even the slightest difference; they were right on with the
actual known hairs from Mr. Simpson.

Q. Did you compare the Negroid hair found on Mr. Goldman's shirt and
the hair found on the Bundy hat with any other hair samples from other
people that were submitted to you by the police department?

A. I did.

Q. And what was the purpose of doing that?

A. Well, elimination standards. It's not an uncommon practice for a
police department to submit elimination standards from individuals who
may have been at the crime scene, who may have handled the evidence,
who may have had old -- removed the body or bodies, and who may have
actually processed, maybe, some of the evidence in the laboratories.

So I received a lot of elimination standards, hair standards from
Caucasian individuals, Mongoloid individuals, and Negroid individuals.

Q. And from what institutions?

A. The LAPD.

Q. Where else?

A. Coroner's office. There were detectives, a number of the detectives
that were there, and the crime -- crime lab people. I believe that's
pretty much all.

Q. And based on the comparisons you did, were there any hair matches
by any of those individuals with the hair that you say was Mr.
Simpson's found on the Bundy cap and the Rockingham glove?

A. Right.

No, there weren't. The question hairs could not have originated from
any of those people, based on my comparisons.

Q. Only one that it could?

A. Why, in this case, yes.

Q. Is Mr. Simpson?

A. The only one I matched it to.

MR. MEDVENE: This would be a convenient time, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Okay.

Ladies and gentlemen, 8:30 tomorrow.

Don't talk about the case. Don't form or express any opinions. Don't
read any news articles, watch any TV or listen to any radio programs
concerning any subject matter concerning this case.

See you tomorrow.

(At 4:30 P.M., an adjournment was taken until Wednesday, November 13,
1996, at 8:30 A.M.)
