(Photograph of Ron Goldman and Kim Goldman walking with their backs to

A. Ron and Kim.

Q. And is that about the time when Ron and Kim came to live with you?

A. It's actually before that. It was when Ron was a little past six
and Kim three. It was shortly after we were divorced.

Q. And then you raised Ron and Kim on your own for a number of years,
right?

A. Yes.

Q. And then, at some point, did you get married again?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. And when was that?

Q. And --

MR. PETROCELLI: Would you put on the next picture, the second photo.

THE COURT REPORTER: Exhibit number, please?

MR. PETROCELLI: They're all from Exhibit 771.

(Photograph of Fred Goldman wearing a tuxedo, Ron Goldman, and Kim
Goldman was displayed on the Elmo screen.)

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) That is a picture of Ron and Kim and you?

A. Yes.

Q. What is the occasion?

A. The day that I got married.

Q. To your second wife?

A. Second wife.

Q. And her name was?

A. Joan.

Q. And did Joan, you, Ron, and Kim all live together?

A. Yes, we did.

Q. For how many years?

A. Four.

Q. Up until the time when Ron was about what?

A. '77, -- '81 -- 13 -- 13 or 14, if my math is correct.

Q. And at some point in time, did your relationship with Joan come to
an end?

A. Yes, it did.

Q. You and she were divorced?

A. Yes.

Q. Did Ron and Kim continue to live with you the whole time?

A. The whole time.

Q. Can you tell us a about your relationship with your son when he was
a boy?

What kind of boy was he? And we just want to share some of your
thoughts about that.

A. Ron was -- Ron had a smile on his face from the day he was born,
and he was a happy-go-lucky kid that never seemed to have a care in
the world.

He was truly Kim's big brother. She always referred to him as her
second father.

He was always there for Kim.

Q. Did you do the normal things a father and son do together?

A. Yeah. We were in Indian Guides together; that's a program through
the YMCA for fathers and sons.

Ron was in little league, and we did all of that stuff together. Ron
and I, neither one of us were major fans of -- of sports, so we did a
little of that, but not a lot. But all the normal father and stuff --
father-and-son stuff.

Q. Did you take vacations together?

A. All the time.

Q. Can you put up the next picture, Steve

(Photograph depicting Fred Goldman, Ron Goldman, and Kim Goldman, who
was wearing a sombrero, displayed on the Elmo screen.)

Q. Can you tell us about this photograph?

A. That was a trip to -- the three of us went on alone. I surprised
Ron and Kim. They didn't know where we were going until we got to the
airport. We went to Alcapulco.

Q. So the three of you were all very close growing up?

A. Very much so.

Q. Okay.

And when Ron got into high school, did you -- did your relationship
with him stay close?

A. It was always close. There was something special about our
relationship. No matter what, nothing ever seemed to get in the way.
It was always this bond that never dissipated.

When Ron went into high school, it was the same.

Q. And what about discipline?

A. Well, I think we had probably the normal father/son/daughter
problems.

The one that I can probably think of was that Ron and I had a deal
about him getting to school when he first started high school.

We lived about six or -- yeah, maybe five or six miles away. And there
was -- there was a bus service from the school, but if you missed the
bus, you were out of luck. And there were numerous times that Ron
missed the bus, and I was -- became the designated driver. And we had
kind of a deal at some point, that, if Ron missed the bus again, he'd
have to walk to school. And he did -- and he did. And that was the
last time he walked to school.

Q. Did you --

MR. PETROCELLI: Could you put on the third photo.

(Photograph of Ron Goldman, lying down, wearing a yellow shirt, was
displayed on the Elmo screen.)

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) This about high school for Ron?

A. Yes. That was in 1985, December of 1985, December or January of
'85.

Q. And put on the next photo.

(Photograph of Ron Goldman, wearing cap and gown was displayed on the
Elmo screen.)

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Is this Ron's high-school graduation --

A. Yes.

Q. -- in Illinois?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, after Ron graduated from this, Mr. Goldman, what did he do?

A. After he graduated from high school?

Q. Yeah.

A. Ron went to Pierce -- Not Pierce College -- went to Illinois State
University in -- in Illinois.

Q. For how long did he go there?

A. Ron went for only one semester.

Q. And why did he stop going to college for one semester at Illinois
State?

A. Like with a lot of things, we had a deal, if you would, about
goals. And Ron's goal was certain grades in college. And the deal was
that if he didn't make his goals at the end of first semester, he'd
have to come home at the end of first semester.

And he spent a little too much time playing and not enough time
studying, and he ended up coming home.

Q. Okay.

And after he came home from college, did -- was it about that time
when you married Patty?

A. Yes. Patty and I got married in February of 1986.

Q. And Patty brought to your family children of her own?

A. Three.

Q. And they are --

A. I think I just said '86. We got married in '87.

She wouldn't let me forget that we missed that one.

Q. And Patty's children are?

A. Patty's children are Bryan, who is now 21; Michael, who is 18; and
Lauren, who is 16.

Q. And with Patty's three children and your two children, what did the
new family do after your marriage?

A. Well, three days after we got married, we put two families together
and moved to California, and -- what some people, I guess, call the
Brady Bunch. But I can assure you, that's not real life, but it was
still a lot of fun.

Q. And you moved to California?

A. Moved to California three days after we got married.

Q. And you moved into Agoura?

A. Agoura, yes.

Q. And that's where you still live?

A. Still live.

Q. Now, Ron was about 19 years old then?

A. Ron was -- in '87, he would have been 17. He was just 18.

Q. And Ron moved in with you?

A. Correct. Correct. We all lived together.

Q. What kind of relationship did Ron have with Patty's three children?

A. Ron instantly became everybody's big brother, besides Kim. He was
Brian's, Michael's, and Loren's instant big brother.

Ron loved kids, and it was real easy for him to take on the additional
role.

Q. And what did Ron --

Well, let me ask you this: How did Ron take to living in Southern
California?

A. He loved it. He was like a duck to water. He absolutely loved
California, loved the mountains, loved the ocean.

He was in -- he was in ecstasy when he came here.

Q. And what did he begin to do with himself?

Did he go to school?

A. Shortly after we moved here, Ron -- that's September -- started at
Pierce College.

Q. And how long did he stay there?

A. Ron was there, again, one semester.

Q. And how did Ron do in school?

A. Okay.

But Ron, I guess, at that point, and me later, discovered that Ron
just wasn't cut out to be a student. He had other aspirations. And it
was -- it was tough for me to accept that for a while, but it made
sense, ultimately.

Q. It was tough for you in what way?

A. Well, I guess like a lot of parents, perhaps, it was my feeling
that the way to -- to success was going to be college. And -- but to
-- the way around success wasn't going to -- going to be -- wasn't
going to be college; it was -- it was going to be other things. It was
hard for me to accept that.

Q. When Ron left Pierce College, did he do something with his time?

A. When he left?

Q. Yeah.

A. Oh, yeah. Ron was always working. He had jobs during Pierce --
during Pierce. Ron actually had several jobs.

He applied for a job that was -- there was one at -- Pierce, had a
little -- as it was ultimately explained to me, they -- they had a
little table out, looking for students to apply. And it was for a
camp, to be a counselor. And Ron applied and was hired.

Q. It was a camp for?

A. Inner-city kids, a sleep-over camp, and Ron was hired as a
counselor.

Actually -- excuse me -- a nighttime counselor. Ron would go there
late in the afternoon and stay overnight.

Q. And Ron enjoyed helping the children?

A. He loved it.

I met the -- the woman that hired Ron, and she told me once that Ron
was the only student from Pierce that applied that was enthusiastic,
and that was the reason she hired him. And she said that Ron would
stay up late with the kids, helping them with -- with their future.
And she said the one thing that she remembered that Ron would always
tell them, is go to school; I didn't, but you need to get your life
organized. And I made enough mistakes for all of us, so don't any of
you make them.

Q. Did Ron, at some time, get a job working with patients at the
United Cerebral Palsy Hospital?

A. Yeah. Ron first got a job at a resident's home in Westlake with
cerebral palsy patients.

First, it was a volunteer position that ultimately turned into a paid
position. He was responsible for the care of the patients, helping
them get dressed, helping feed them, outings, and the like.

Q. And during this time, Ron is still living with you in your home in
Agoura?

A. Yes, yes.

Q. Now, there came a time in about 1990, when Ron decided to move out
on his own?

A. Yes, he did.

Q. And he's about 20, 21 years old then?

A. 1990, Ron was almost -- going on 22.

Q. And where did Ron go?

A. Ron lived first in Calabasas, and then ultimately -- he moved -- he
moved a couple of times -- Woodland Hills.

Q. And Ron was living in apartments, would you say, for the next
several years?

A. Yes.

Q. And during that period of time, did you maintain a relationship
with Ron?

A. Always. It never stopped.

Q. And what sort of things did you do together?

A. I guess the normal things. You know, we spent as much time as
humanly possible. I'd meet Ron for lunch, or dinner, or he'd meet us.

Ron, since he lived close, it was easy to always stop by the house.

Ron was always involved with everybody and if -- if some of the kids
had things going on, Ron was always there for those, as well.

Q. And what was Ron doing with -- with his time when he was living out
-- what kind of work was he doing?

A. Primarily waitering. He had a job for a short while, working for a
job recruiter, but ultimately, Ron was doing a lot of work -- working
as a waiter.

Q. In various --

A. Various restaurants, right.

Q. And did Ron have his share of screw-ups as a young man?

A. He did. Without question.

Probably the two biggest, or maybe the single biggest for Ron was a
combination of things.

Ron would say, as would Kim, that they learned to drive with a little
lead foot from me. Ron got himself a pack of traffic tickets and
ultimately lost his license. And then, even worse, he was picked up
for driving with a suspended license, and he was, in fact, arrested.

Q. And he called you from the jail?

A. He called -- it was late one night. He called the house. Kim woke
me up. And I went down to get him out.

That happened, actually, one more time. But that time, it seems to me,
almost a year later, his license had still been suspended and he had
risked it again and was driving. And at that point, I was not aware of
it, because he called Kim who was up at Santa Barbara, going to
school.

He told her that he didn't want me to know about it. He wanted to
handle it on his own. And as I found out later, he went before the
judge, and the judge offered him a choice of, pay a fine or go to jail
for four days.

And he made the choice to go to jail for four days.

Q. And you didn't know about it at the time?

A. I didn't know about it until after the fact, no.

He said -- told us later that he wanted to handle it on his own.

Q. And in regard to handling his finances, working as a waiter, how
good did Ron do?

A. Oh, Ron got himself into a bit of a financial pickle.

He literally got himself into debt over his head. And we had numerous
conversations about that. And there was some discussion at one point
about filing bankruptcy. But at first, Ron wanted to try to work it
out. But it -- it became way too -- way too burdensome. He wasn't
making enough money through his -- his waitering job to cover that and
-- And rent, et cetera. And he ultimately, after he and I went to a
financial counselor to see if he could work it out, he ultimately,
about six months after that, filed bankruptcy --

Q. And --

A. -- reluctantly.

Q. -- how much did he owe?

A. He really got himself in deep. He owed somewhere close to $12,000,
real deep.

Q. Did you offer to just give him the money?

A. No. It was a tough decision. I didn't.

I had always, I guess you can say, practiced tough-love parenting, and
I -- it was something -- that was something I would have had a problem
doing, bailing him out.

Ron understood. Ron didn't have a problem with that. He wanted to
handle it on his own.

Q. As part of this, did Ron make the decision to move back into your
home?

A. It was in good part because of that. The ultimate move back home,
finances were just getting too tough.

Q. This is around 1992 --

A. 19 --

Q. -- that he moved back?

A. It was either somewhere between '90 and '92. I can't remember
exactly.

Q. He lived at home for a period of time?

A. About a year, again.

Q. And while he was living at home, again, he was working in various
jobs as a -- as a waiter?

A. Right, correct.

Q. What was your relationship like?

A. Always -- it was always good. Ron -- Ron never let his
relationships in any way suffer because of anything. Our relationship
was always good. His relationship with everybody in the family was
good.

Q. And did he attend family outings and family functions?

A. Always, always.

The last -- The last big function that Ron attended was -- was
Lauren's Bat Mitzvah in 1993, November.

MR. PETROCELLI: Can you put the photo up.

(Photograph of Fred Goldman, Ron Goldman, and Kim Goldman, wearing a
black dress, displayed on Elmo screen.)

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) That's what you're referring to?

A. Yeah. That was taken just before --

Q. It's November 13, 1993?

A. Yes.

Q. It's about seven, eight months before Ron's death?

A. Right.

Q. During this period of time, did Ron begin to mature and set some
goals for himself?

A. Yeah. Actually, it began -- it began not that long before we got
here, Ron went through a transformation. He came here as a skinny kid,
and Ron started to eat healthy, more healthy than ever before; started
to work out; never -- stopped completely any drinking of beer or
anything; never smoked -- stopped completely. His big push was to get
as healthy as possible, and he did.

It was amazing to see pictures of him over a couple of years.

He made just enormous changes. And likewise, along with the issue of
in and out of the various jobs.

Ron made a decision among all of these various waiter jobs, that that
was going to be his career. And we found out lots later how much.

Q. Sometime in 1993, did Ron approach you about being a partner of his
in business?

A. Yeah. Ron came to me about oh, six or nine months before he was
murdered, and said he had an idea about a restaurant that he wanted to
-- to do, and wanted to know if -- if I would invest in it.

I told him that the answer was yes. But did he have anything more --
more information. And he said, I'll let you know when I have more. I
just want -- I just want to know if you will.

Q. What did you say?

A. I said yes.

Q. And did you hear anything more from Ron about his plan of opening
up this restaurant?

A. No, I didn't. Not -- No, not from Ron, directly.

Q. And after his death, did you find out something about this?

A. Yeah.

MR. BAKER: I'm going to object on relevancy grounds and hearsay.

THE COURT: Approach the bench.

(The following proceedings were held at the bench, with the reporter.)

MR. PETROCELLI: I have a few more questions in this line. After Ron's
death, when they went to his apartment, his father found Ron's plans
to open up his restaurant, and there's a little diagram of what it was
going to look like. And I'm just going to ask him a few questions
about that.

It's not offered for the truth of the matter, so it's not hearsay. It
goes to the nature of the relationship between the two of them, which
is the heart of the issue here.

MR. BAKER: It doesn't go to the nature of the relationship at all.
He's testified as to he would -- whether he would invest. Whether Ron
had made some plans to do it or not is totally irrelevant. There's no
issue of Ron ever supporting his father in this case at all. There's
no economic relationship at all. And hence, it has no relevancy in
this case.

MR. PETROCELLI: It's not a monetary issue; it goes to the loss of
society. That's the only issue that we are proffering in this case.

MR. BAKER: A business enterprise doesn't go to loss of society, in my
opinion, sir, and it's irrelevant.

THE COURT: Overruled.

(The following proceedings were held in open court, in the presence of
the jury.)

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Sorry, Mr. Goldman.

You were saying after Ron's death, you found out some information
about his plans to open up a business, a restaurant?

A. Yeah.

After Ron was murdered, we were cleaning out Ron's apartment, and we
found a -- a file with all kinds of information in it.

There were proposed menus, ideas for the kinds of things that Ron
wanted to have on the menu. He had names of various chefs that he had
met, had names of people that were apparently interested in -- in --
in being involved. And he had a drawing of what he wanted his
restaurant to look like.

(The instrument herein referred to as a Hand-drawn Diagram of Ron
Goldman's planned restaurant was marked for identification as
Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 772.)

(Diagram displayed on the Elmo screen.)

Q. Is that the drawing on the TV?

A. Yeah.

I never realized how far Ron had gotten with his plans and his dreams.

Q. Mr. Goldman, what is the shape of that diagram? Does it have any
significance?

(Pause in proceedings. Mr. Goldman sobbing.)

A. I'm sorry.

It's the Egyptian symbol that Ron wore around his neck. It was an
Egyptian symbol, the round shape with the line across it, and then the
vertical line below it, was the Egyptian symbol of an ankh.

Q. What does the ankh stand for?

(Pause in proceedings. Mr. Goldman sobbing.)

A. It meant eternal life.

Q. And Ron were the ankh around his neck?

A. Yes.

Q. Are you able to finish this up, Mr. Goldman?

A. Yeah.

Q. Okay.

A. Doesn't wear it anymore; Kim wears it now.

Q. And Ron talked to you about wanting to have a family?

A. Yeah.

Besides wanting a restaurant, Ron wanted only two other things: Wanted
to be married and have children.

Ron -- Ron absolutely adored kids. It was probably part of the reason
why he was so good at his job at the camp; was also the reason why he
took a job as -- as a tennis coach for the high-school tennis team.

When we were ever with any of our friends who had little kids, as with
Michael and Lauren, especially, when they were little, Ron was always
like the Pied Piper. And he'd have little kids following him all over
the place. And Ron wanted to have kids of his own.

Q. Did he have a name picked out for his first child?

A. Yeah.

Q. What was that?

A. Ron picked a name out of -- I'm not sure where it came from, but he
had decided that he was going to name his first child Dakota, whether
it was a boy or a girl.

Never had that chance.

Q. Mr. -- I'm sorry.

Focusing on the last several months -- several months of Ron's life,
did you see him during that period of time -- let's say from Lauren's
Bat Mitzvah, in November of '93, till Ron's death in June of 1994?

A. Yeah. We spent Thanksgiving together, my birthday in December,
Kim's birthday, the end of December. Patty's birthday in February.
Michael's birthday in March. Mother's Day --

Amazing I can remember these.

Mother's Day in May.

Something tells me I'm missing something.

Q. And in between those various family events --

A. Oh, had Passover in there someplace.

Q. -- did you see Ron in between those times?

A. Yeah. Ron and I always found a way to see each other. He had -- he
had his schedule for work, was always varying from day shifts to night
shifts. But I'd either meet him at work or we'd meet somewhere. Yeah.
Yeah, we always found a way to meet, or he was always coming out to
the house.

Q. Now, this period of time, end of '93 into '94, by then, had Ron
moved out of your home again?

A. Yeah. Ron moved out again. He moved --that's when he moved into
Brentwood.

Q. And did you ever have a chance to go to his apartment in Brentwood?

A. Yes. I -- we went there numerous times.

Q. Did Ron talk to you about whether he liked Brentwood, living there?

A. He liked Brentwood.

I wish he hadn't moved there.

MR. PETROCELLI: Can you put up that last picture.

(Photograph of Ron Goldman, wearing blue shorts, with his arm around a
person wearing red shorts, displayed on the Elmo screen.)

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) What is this photo, Mr. Goldman?

A. As best as I know, that's one of the last -- last pictures taken of
Ron.

Q. You found that after his death?

A. Yes. He was -- he played softball in Brentwood with a bunch of
kids.

My favorite picture of him.

MR. PETROCELLI: Take it down.

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) The last video you have of Ron is at the Bat
Mitzvah?

A. Yeah.

MR. PETROCELLI: Can you play it.

(Videotape originated on November 13, 1993, was played.)

(Videotape concluded playing.)

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Mr. Goldman, did you love your son?

A. Oh, God, yes.

Q. Do you miss him?

A. More than you can imagine.

Q. Do you think about him every day?

A. There isn't a day that goes by that I don't think of Ron.

Q. Will your life ever be the same again?

A. Never, ever be the same. A hole missing.

Q. Thank you, sir.

THE COURT: Take a brief, ten-minute recess, ladies and gentlemen.

(Recess.)

(Jurors resumed their respective seats.)

MR. BAKER: Thank you.

CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. BAKER:

Q. I've got a few questions.

Now, as I understand it, Sharon Rufo was the mother of Ron; is that
correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. And Sharon Rufo, to the best of your knowledge, had not seen your
son 13 or 14 years before -- for a period of 13 or 14 years before
Ron's death; is that correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. And you have seen her in this courtroom, have you not?

A. Yes.

Q. She did not, however, make it out to Ron's funeral, did she?

A. I didn't hear you.

Q. I apologize.

She did not attend Ron's funeral. Was she --

A. She was here for Ron's funeral.

Q. Now, in terms -- in your deposition you indicated I thought that
she had not.

MR. PETROCELLI: I don't think so, Mr. Baker.

MR. BAKER: Okay. I apologize.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) In terms of your notification, the LAPD did not
notify you of your son's demise?

A. We were notified by the coroner's office I believe.

Q. And you were notified by the coroner's office at about 5 p.m. on
June 13, 1994; is that correct?

A. Correct.

Q. Now, in terms of Nicole Brown Simpson, you -- you didn't know that
your son even knew her at the time he was murdered, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. You did find that her phone number was in his apartment when it was
cleaned up?

A. As I recall, there was a phone directory that had the name Nicole
in it. I don't recall the number or anything like that.

Q. And just on another area, you -- since the murders of Nicole Brown
Simpson and your son, you have become friends with Detectives
Vannatter and Lange, correct?

A. You said friends?

Q. Friends.

A. No, I don't --

MR. PETROCELLI: Outside the scope, Your Honor.

THE WITNESS: Should I answer?

THE COURT: Yes.

A. No, I don't know that friends is accurate.

I mean I -- I consider friends someone you constantly spend a lot of
time with. That's not the case.

Q. Did Detective Vannatter spend -- was he at any of the fund raisers
that you gave?

THE COURT: Mr. Baker, if you're going to proceed on this, you're not
going to call this witness on your direct.

MR. BAKER: I understand.

MR. PETROCELLI: I have an objection to scope.

THE COURT: Overruled. Treat this as defense witness called out of
order.

MR. BAKER: Under 767?

THE COURT: 776.

MR. BAKER: That's right.

A. I'm sorry, you asked --

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You invited Detective Vannatter -- Mr. Vannatter to
funds raisers that you put on, did you not?

A. No, that's not true.

Q. You went to Detective Vannatter's retirement party, did you not?

A. We -- our family, my wife, my daughter and I went to Detective
Vannatter's retirement party, correct.

Q. Went to Detective Lange's retirement party?

A. Correct.

Q. You became friends with FBI agents Deedrick and Bodziak, correct?

A. No.

Q. How is it Detective Bodziak -- you have his picture with Detective
Bodziak and Kim, do you know?

MR. PETROCELLI: That's Deedrick.

MR. BAKER: I apologize. It was Deedrick.

A. If you're talking about the picture that was testified to --

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Yes.

A. -- I assume -- I don't recall, but I assume that was taken at -- at
one of the retirement dinners.

Q. Now, when Detective Vannatter was -- did Detective -- Deedrick come
out for one of the retirement dinners?

A. It was either there or it was at the police -- at the D.A.'s
office. There's only a handful of places that it could have been. More
likely it was at the D.A.'s office.

Q. And in fact, after the criminal trial, you participated in a news
conference with the detectives, as well as the district attorney,
indicating your displeasure with the jury verdict?

MR. PETROCELLI: Irrelevant, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Does your daughter call Mr. Vannatter Uncle Phil,
ever refer to him as that?

A. No.

Q. Now, you've talked to Detective -- Mr. Tippin and Mr. Marlow, have
you not, relative -- when they were on the LAPD investigating this
case?

A. As I recall, the only time I talked to Detective Tippin was when we
went to Ron's apartment.

Q. You've talked to Detective Marlow certainly after this case as a
civil (sic) case has been prosecuted, have you not?

A. I don't recall ever talking to Detective Marlow.

Q. Mr. Goldman, since the trial started, how many press conferences
have you held, since this trial started in September? We started jury
selection on September 18, 1996.

A. Press conferences?

Q. Press conferences.

A. As I recall, there was one when I announced my new job.

Q. And you also had one out here on the front lawn of the -- of the
court house after you appeared on "Larry King Live"; is that true?

MR. PETROCELLI: Your Honor, this is really irrelevant.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) And you -- you have now signed a book deal that --
that was discussed in your deposition; is that correct?

A. My family in total is writing a book, that's correct.

Q. And the guaranteed advance on that book, Mr. Goldman, is how much?

MR. PETROCELLI: It's irrelevant.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. The total advance is 450,000. Out of that, my family gets
approximately half.

MR. BAKER: That's all I have.

MR. PETROCELLI: Nothing, Your Honor.

I've got to move in Exhibit 771 and 772, and I want to reserve the
right to put on any additional evidence with regard to the reservation
by the defense to our exhibits 'cause they have reserved in regard to
a number of exhibits.

THE COURT: All right.

(The instrument herein described was received in evidence as
Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 771.)

(The instrument herein described was received in evidence as
Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 772.)

MR. PETROCELLI: And finally, Your Honor, I would like to reserve the
right to call Alfred Acosta pursuant to the Court's previous order. He
had to go out of town on a family emergency.

THE COURT: Yes.

MR. PETROCELLI: And subject to those reservations, Your Honor, the
plaintiffs rest.

THE COURT: Thank you.

Defense.

MR. BAKER: Defense calls Phil Vannatter.

THE COURT: You can have a seat on the witness stand.

THE CLERK: You can have a seat on the witness stand.

Sir, you've already been sworn. You are still under oath.

Would you state your name again for the record.

THE WITNESS: Philip Vannatter.

PHILIP VANNATTER, called as a witness on behalf of Defendants, was
previously sworn and testified as follows:

DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. BAKER:

Q. Good morning.

A. Good morning.

Q. Mr. Vannatter, when did you arrive in southern California?

A. Saturday afternoon.

Q. And did you spend yesterday in any type of preparation for your
testimony here today, sir?

A. Yes, I had a meeting with Mr. Kelly, yesterday.

Q. And how long did that meeting take?

A. Approximately two hours.

Q. And did you review any of the testimony that you gave, for example,
at the grand jury hearing?

A. No, I did not.

Q. Did you review any testimony you gave at the preliminary hearing?

A. I was asked questions about the trial testimony.

Q. All right.

And did you review the trial testimony that you had given?

A. I didn't read it. I was asked questions by Mr. Kelly.

Q. And did you review any of the transcripts of any of the TV shows
that you've been on since the verdict of October, 1995?

A. No, sir, I didn't.

Q. Now, as -- as I understand it, at the time in June of 1994 when you
were called on this case, you had been a detective for 26 and a half
years in LAPD, correct?

A. No. That's -- I had been a police officer for 26 and a half years.

Q. All right.

How long you been a detective?

A. I transferred to detectives, I believe, in 1971, September of '71.

Q. So 23 years, roughly?

A. Approximately, yes.

Q. Okay.

And you had risen through the ranks to a Detective 3 by the time that
you investigated the double murders at 875 South Bundy, correct?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And Detective 3 was -- you were the highest ranking detective among
the four detectives who were at the scene on June 13, 1994, correct?

A. The highest ranking detective -- there were two other Detective
3's.

Q. You were the most senior Detective 3, so you were in charge by
virtue of your seniority and the fact that you were a Detective 3,
correct?

A. It was a dual in charge with Mr. Lange.

Q. So is there a Detective 4 at the LAPD or is Detective 3 as high as
you get?

A. Detective 3 is an advance pay grade, as high as you go, yes.

Q. So you were a Detective 3 and Tom Lange was a Detective 3, correct?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And because you had been a Detective 3 longer, if in fact push came
to shove, you were in charge, correct?

A. Not necessarily. We were partners. I believe there was a month
difference in our pay grade promotion.

Q. And as the detective from robbery/homicide -- we're going to get
into that in a minute -- you were in charge in directing the criminal
fingerprint people as well as the coroner, true?

A. At that crime scene?

Q. Yes.

A. No, sir, I wasn't. Detective Lange was.

Q. All right.

Now, you would agree as a detective of 23 years that there are certain
fundamentals in investigating the crime scene that must be adhered to
to ensure not only the integrity of the crime scene, but the chain of
custody of the evidence, true?

A. I'm not sure I understand what you mean, fundamentals, there are
certain things that have to be done, yes.

Q. Well, one of the fundamentals of a crime scene is obviously to
recognize what is evidence, correct?

A. Yes.

MR. KELLY: Objection, Your Honor, speculative. If we're talking about
this particular crime scene, that's something different.

THE COURT: I'll allow a certain amount of preliminary, but after that,
stay with this case.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Well, you didn't reinvent fundamentals of the double
murders at 875 South Bundy. These are fundamentals you had to
investigate crime scenes when you started investigating crime scenes
23 years ago, correct?

MR. KELLY: Objection, vague.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) The investigation, sir, of a crime scene has certain
fundamental procedures that you go through to ensure that the crime
scene integrity is maintained and that the change of custody of the
evidence is preserved; you would agree with that?

MR. KELLY: Same objection, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. Each crime scene is unique in itself. So ones you're talking about
could be different from crime scene to crime scene.

Q. The first thing you have to do, Detective Vannatter, is to
recognize what's evidence and what isn't, true?

MR. KELLY: Same objection. If we could focus in on June 12.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. I would -- I would hope that you would recognize what is evidence
and what isn't, yes.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) The second procedure that you must use in that crime
scene is to collect the evidence that you recognize as to be relevant
to any portion of the crime, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And the third and very important step in crime scene procedure, is
the documentation of what you do, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And that is, that you have to document where you've been, what
you've done, what evidence you've collected and where you personally
have been throughout the crime scene, and your processing of a crime
scene, correct?

A. I -- I'm not sure. You can't do it on a minute-to-minute basis. You
attempt to keep a chronological record of what had occurred, yes.

Q. And then you didn't do that at all, did you, by the way, you didn't
document where you were at 4 o'clock in the morning, did you?

A. It was -- it was documented, yes.

Q. I said you didn't document it at all, did you, sir?

A. Well, I checked in at the crime scene with the log personnel, yes.

Q. Did you document your movements at 875 South Bundy at all from 4 to
5 o'clock in the morning on June 13, 1994?

A. Are you asking me did I write notes?

Q. That's what I'm asking you.

A. No, sir, I didn't.

Q. And you also had investigated, by -- at least you indicated in your
sworn affidavit in furtherance of a search warrant on June 28, 1994,
that you investigated over 200 homicides by the time you investigated
the crimes at 875 South Bundy, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And so you certainly knew that documentation of your movements and
what went on at a crime scene was important, true?

A. Again, each crime scene is unique. If it's being done by someone
else, then there's no need to duplicate that effort.

Q. Okay.

So you didn't feel that there was any need to document anything at 875
South Bundy when you were there from 4 to 5 o'clock in the morning,
true?

A. I didn't do anything other than look there one time briefly, no, I
didn't.

Q. So the answer to my question is no, you didn't feel any need to
document anything at that crime scene, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. Now, another fundamental is the preservation of evidence at a crime
scene, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And as I understand it, sir, when you were notified of the double
homicide at -- it was approximately what, 2:30 in the morning, of June
13, 1994?

A. No, sir. It was 3 o'clock in the morning.

Q. In any event, you got to 875 South Bundy at approximately 4 o'clock
in the morning, did you not?

A. Approximately, yes.

Q. And you had been a detective at West LA division of the LAPD for at
least what, three years, at the time that you investigated this crime
scene on behalf of robbery/homicide division, true?

A. No. I was not at West LA then. I had worked there previously, yes.

Q. You had worked there for three years at as a detective -- homicide
detective, had you not?

A. Yes, back in the mid 70's, that's correct.

Q. You knew the area around 875 South Bundy, did you not?

A. No, I don't think I've ever been there, except on this case.

Q. You have never been down Bundy?

A. No, I've been down Bundy. I've never been to that location.

Q. Okay.

I said -- maybe my question was unclear.

I said you knew the area around the Bundy double homicide location,
did you not, sir?

A. I had worked at West LA and I know a lot of the city. I don't know
that I knew specifically where 875 South Bundy was.

Q. All right.

In any event, the procedure, as I understand it, of the L.A.P.D. is
that once robbery/homicide division takes over a case, that the local
detectives from -- in this case, West Los Angeles, simply discontinue
investigating the crime scene, right?

A. They lose responsibility for the crime scene. In many, many
instances they are asked to assist in the crime scene investigation.

MR. BAKER: Well, pull up 19137, please.

MR. KELLY: What are you referring to?

MR. BAKER: Pardon?

MR. KELLY: Transcript?

MR. BAKER: 19137, trial.

MR. KELLY: Trial.

Could we have a line.

MR. BAKER: Lines 27 to 4 on the other -- 19138.

Are you ready?

MR. KELLY: Okay. I'm sorry.

(Transcript displayed on Elmo.)

MR. BAKER: Bottom of the page.

(Reading:)

Q. Once local detectives

R/H/D . . . that's robbery/homicide

division . . . take over, should they

continue to investigate the crime? A. No, they shouldn't. They

should only maintain the security and

integrity of the crime scene.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) That was your testimony at the trial, was it not,
sir?

A. That's correct, sir.

Q. And so is it true that, once robbery/homicide takes over, the
entire investigation simply stops, that's LAPD procedure, right?

A. I don't understand that.

Q. I don't, either, but let me -- let me see if we can get it
straight.

At 2:45 on the morning of June 13, 1994, robbery/homicide division
took over the investigation of the double homicide at 875 South Bundy,
correct?

A. I was not aware of that. I was aware when I got there at 4 o'clock
in the morning.

Q. In any event, assume that at 2:45, the robbery/homicide division
takes over. That means that the local detectives from West LA are to
do absolutely nothing; that is, they are not to continue their
investigation, but they are only to maintain the integrity of the
crime scene, correct?

MR. KELLY: Objection, calls for hearsay, speculative. This witness
indicates he has no knowledge of that, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) In the procedure that the police department uses,
once robbery/homicide division takes over, the local detectives, in
this case Detectives Phillips and Fuhrman, are not supposed to do any
further investigation, correct?

A. Well, I think that could depend on the situation. What --

Q. No, no.

A. What --

Q. Maybe you didn't understand my -- You have testified, have you not,
that the local detectives are not to investigate the crime scene -- to
continue the investigation of the crime scene.

THE COURT: Mr. Baker, I'm going to interject myself. I don't want to.
I'm going to interject myself. You've already established through his
agreement as to the trial testimony. We're just going around in
circles. I'm sustaining my own objection.

Move on, please.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, now, you knew that the call had come in at
approximately 10 minutes after midnight, relative to the notification
that there were two bodies found at 875 South Bundy, correct?

MR. KELLY: Objection, calls for hearsay, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Well, what time did you think that the crime scene
was -- When you got to the crime scene it was approximately 4 o'clock
in the morning?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. You talked to Detective Phillips, did you not?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And he told you that -- informed you approximately what time the
crime scene had been set up at 875 South Bundy?

MR. KELLY: Objection, same thing, calls for hearsay, Your Honor.

THE COURT: I'll permit that.

A. Yes.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) And so you were aware that the crime scene was
already approximately four hours post discovery by the time that you
arrived there, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And you did not at that time, that is 4 o'clock in the morning, you
did not call any criminalist, did you?

A. No, sir, I didn't.

Q. You did not call any coroner, did you?

A. No, sir, I didn't.

Q. And you were aware that you were to notify the coroner's office
under the directives and procedures of LAPD immediately, true?

A. I -- I don't think that means immediately when you arrive on the
crime scene, that means immediately when you need their assistance at
a crime scene.

Q. So the word immediately is a judgment call, in your opinion, that
you can decide on your own when to call a coroner, that the LAPD
requirements to call the coroner immediately is a judgment call, true?

A. I think what you're talking about when you say --

Q. Can you answer that yes or no, sir?

A. I'm trying to, sir.

Q. Well, answer it yes or no?

A. I can't answer it yes or no.

Q. The regulations of LAPD require you, once you get to a homicide
scene, to notify the coroner, and the words in the regulations are
immediately, correct?

A. That's a first call notification, yes.

Q. And you didn't do it, did you?

A. No, sir, I didn't.

Q. Now, one of the things that is important in the investigation of
any homicide is the time of death, you would agree with that?

MR. KELLY: Objection, Your Honor, with regard -- it's vague with
regard --

THE COURT: Overruled.

MR. KELLY: With regard to any homicide?

A. The time of death?

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) The time of death of the victims?

A. That helps you with the investigation, yes.

Q. And that's important in any investigation, is it not?

A. Yes.

Q. And to your knowledge, although the crime scene had been discovered
at 12:10 on the morning of June 13, there had been absolutely no
notification of the coroner when you arrived at 4 o'clock, correct?

THE COURT: Sustained. That question's been asked and answered.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) When you left at 5 o'clock and -- left the crime
scene, to your knowledge, there had been no notification of the
coroner, true?

A. True.

Q. And there had been no notification of any criminalist, correct?

A. True, to my knowledge.

Q. Now, one of the things that can be used to determine the time of
death is the temperature of the liver of the decedent?

MR. PETROCELLI: I'm going to object, Your Honor.

MR. KELLY: Objection.

MR. PETROCELLI: This is not an issue.

Secondly, we have a motion in limine, No. 11, on these points here.

THE COURT: Approach the bench.

(The following proceedings were held at the bench with the reporter:)

MR. BAKER: Wait a minute. I object to him saying anything. This is not
his witness.

(Indicating to Mr. Petrocelli.)

MR. BAKER: This is his witness.

(Indicating to Mr. Kelly.)

MR. BAKER: As I understand it, one person gets one witness.

THE COURT: You haven't been observing it, Mr. Baker.

MR. PETROCELLI: My objection -- in the first place, time of death was
not established in any way, shape, or form by LAPD evidence or coroner
evidence. It was simply the lay testimony of when they first showed up
and found the bodies. We did not proffer the coroner whatsoever, for
any issue about the time of death. That's number 1.

Number 2, he's arguing about other superior and better techniques for
investigating the homicide and for detecting evidence and so forth.
That was specifically precluded by No. 11.

This is not a malpractice case. Your Honor has ruled that he has to
tie in the alleged omissions or acts to the evidence that we submitted
in this case to show that it somehow affected the quality or integrity
of it. And he is not doing so in this line of questioning at all.
Particularly when he ventures into an issue that we did not even
raise.

MR. BAKER: First of all, they put in the issue of time of death and
they opened up all of these issues through Werner Spitz. Every issue
that we're going to talk about, they went through through Werner
Spitz, this is fundamental in a crime scene, as to the time of death,
and he's already indicated that that's fundamental.

THE COURT: Excuse me. I'll permit the defense to raise and establish
whether or not the time of death was established, but that's it.
Proper technique, I'm sustaining the objection.

MR. PETROCELLI: For the record, I want to establish that or note that
Werner Spitz had never testified at all about time of death. It's
simply not an issue in regard to experts. The body was discovered at
around -- you know -- Sukru Boztepe discovered it a little after
midnight.

THE COURT: I think time of death is inherently at issue.

MR. PETROCELLI: We didn't proffer it through the expert.

MR. BAKER: You're talking through the time --

THE COURT: Excuse me. I think my ruling was made and it's clear.

(The following proceedings were held in open court in the presence of
the jury.)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, we were talking about liver temperature and
time of death before the objection.

And I want to go back and ask you again: You were certainly aware that
liver temperature of a victim can be used to establish time of death,
or an estimate of time of death, true?

A. Depends on the circumstances of the crime scene. That's not always
true.

Q. In your 23 years of being a detective, Mr. Vannatter, have you ever
seen the coroner attempt and take the temperature of the victim's
liver for the purpose of attempting to establish an estimate as to the
time of death?

A. Many, many times. And I've seen times that they haven't taken liver
temperatures.

Q. And in this case, they took the liver temperature in both of the
victims, did they not, sir?

A. Well, I was --

MR. KELLY: Objection, calls for hearsay unless he has personal
knowledge, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You saw the reports in this case, and went through
the reports in this case before you testified at the grand jury
hearing, did you not?

MR. PETROCELLI: Different case, object.

MR. KELLY: Objection, different case. Still calls for testimony of
hearsay from -- they're not his reports.

THE COURT: Overruled. You may testify what you saw in the autopsy or
coroner's report?

A. I was aware that he had -- they had taken liver temperatures, yes.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) And you were further aware, sir, based upon your 23
years as a detective that when liver temperatures are taken, the
closer they are taken to the time of death, the more accurate they are
in estimating the time of death, true?

MR. KELLY: Objection, vague. It's still not talking about this
particular case and these victims.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. That would generally be true. But again it would -- It would depend
on the environment that the crime scene was in.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You had a 60 degree environment at the crime scene
on Bundy, did you not?

A. I believe that's correct, yes.

Q. And basically, no humidity, correct?

A. Basically. I believe there was a little fog or mist in the air.

Q. Under the circumstances that when you arrived at the crime scene at
4 o'clock on June 13, 1994, had you called the coroner, you could have
had a liver temperature taken and an estimate as to the time of death
if you called the coroner, correct?

MR. KELLY: Objection, calls for speculation.

THE COURT: That's -- that's sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Well, you knew in June of `1994, that the liver
temperature decreases approximately -- what, a degree and a half for
the first four hours after death?

MR. KELLY: Same objection.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Well, did you have any knowledge as to whether or
not liver temperature readings are more accurate say 10 hours after
death than they would be 4 hours after death?

MR. KELLY: Same objection again, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Sustained:

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Did it occur to you whatsoever, Mr. Vannatter, to
call the coroner to obtain a liver temperature of the decedents at 4
o'clock in the morning on June 13, 1994?

MR. KELLY: Objection, asked and answered, argumentative.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. No.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) It obviously didn't occur to you at 5 o'clock when
you left the crime scene, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. Now, at the crime scene, between 4 and 5 when you were there, did
you make any efforts whatsoever to identify the second victim?

A. Personally?

Q. Yes, sir.

A. No, sir, I didn't.

Q. You didn't know -- you never tried to pull the wallet out of the
second victim to see the name of the second victim?

A. By California law I couldn't do that.

Q. You didn't check the neighborhood to see what cars were registered
to whom in that area, did you?

A. Not personally. It was being done.

Q. You didn't know that the second victim wasn't the target of the
murders, did you?

MR. KELLY: Objection, calls for speculation.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. BAKER: Well, it goes to his state of mind.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Did you have any knowledge as to who was the target
and who -- or the perpetrator of these crimes, when you were at the
crime scene between 4 and 5 o'clock in the morning on June 13, 1994?

MR. KELLY: Objection, still calls for speculation.

THE COURT: Overruled. He either knew or he didn't.

A. No, I had no idea.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) And you then were at the crime scene for a period of
one hour when, as I understand it, sir, there was a decision made to
go to Rockingham, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, at the crime scene at approximately 5 o'clock in the morning
on June 13, 1994, there are at least 25 other members of LAPD, true?

A. I -- I don't know the exact number but that's probably pretty close
to correct, yes.

Q. And your story, as I understand it, is that you personally made the
decision to notify O.J. Simpson of the demise of his ex-wife, correct?

A. That was discussed with myself and Mr. Lange when we made the
decision, yes.

Q. And your decision was made independently of any purported decision
by Commander Bushey to Ron Phillips, correct?

A. I would have gone whether the order was there or not, but I was
also aware that there was an order by Commander Bushey for that to be
done.

Q. So, you -- as I understand it, you made your own determination that
there should be personal notification of O.J. Simpson, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And at the time you made this -- your own personal decision at 5
o'clock in the morning, you were aware that there were two victims at
875 South Bundy, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. You were aware that the crime scene included a hat, gloves, true?

A. One glove. Not gloves, one glove.

Q. Fair enough.

Hat, glove, keys, pager. All of that was at the crime seen at 875
South Bundy, right?

A. That's correct.

Q. You were aware that there were blood drops at 875 South Bundy?

A. Yes.

Q. You were aware that there were blood smears at 875 South Bundy?

A. Yes.

Q. You were aware that there was blood drops on the back of victim
Nicole Brown Simpson at 875 South Bundy?

A. I -- No, I can't say that I was aware of that. I didn't do that
crime scene. I -- I -- that was done by Mr. Lange.

Q. You were aware that there was copious amounts of blood at 875 South
Bundy?

A. Yes.

Q. You were aware that there were shoe prints at 875 South Bundy?

A. What appeared to be shoe prints, yes.

Q. You were aware that there were paw prints that went 50 feet south
on the walkway on the south side toward Bundy?

A. Yes.

Q. All of those were at 875 South Bundy when you left the crime scene
and went to Rockingham, true?

A. True.

Q. And at the point that that was a crime scene at 875 South Bundy,
Mr. Vannatter, that was rich in evidence, correct?

A. It appeared to be, yes.

Q. You were also aware when you left that crime scene there would be
no detective work going on because you and Detective Lange were in
charge of the investigation from robbery/homicide investigation,
correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And you were aware that basically there had been no detective work
done on that crime scene for the first five hours after that crime
scene had been discovered, at the time you made the decision to
personally notify Mr. Simpson of the death of his ex-wife, true?

A. That's correct.

Q. And so there were at least 25 other people who could have gone to
Rockingham to personally notify Mr. Simpson of the deaths of his
ex-wife, isn't that true?

A. Yes.

Q. And you made the decision to personally do it at 5 a.m. in the
morning, and leave the crime scene where no detective work had gone on
for five hours, right?

A. Yes.

Q. And at the time that you left 875 South Bundy you were aware that
one of the victims was the ex-wife of Mr. Simpson, true?

A. Yes.

Q. You were also aware that there had been an issue of domestic
violence between Mr. Simpson and the victim, true?

A. I was aware that there had been an incident in which a uniformed
officer had gone up there, yes.

Q. And in your mind, Mr. Simpson was a suspect, that's why you left
875 South Bundy and went to Rockingham; isn't that true?

A. That would have been a real rush to judgment if I had went up there
thinking he was a suspect. No, he was not a suspect.

Q. I totally agree with you.

A. He was not a suspect.

Q. And, in fact, he was a suspect from the time that you arrived at
875 South Bundy; isn't that correct?

A. In my mind?

Q. Yes, sir.

A. No, that's not correct.

Q. And let's -- Was it your -- Was it your sworn testimony, sir, in
the trial that Mr. Simpson was no more a suspect than Mr. Shapiro, one
of his criminal attorneys?

MR. KELLY: Objection, calls for hearsay.

MR. PETROCELLI: No foundation for prior inconsistent statement at all,
got to be just the opposite.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Do you believe that Mr. Simpson was no more a
suspect than Mr. Robert Shapiro, one of O.J. Simpson's criminal
lawyers, at the time that you went from 875 South Bundy to Rockingham
knowing that O.J. Simpson and Nicole Brown Simpson were divorced, and
knowing that there was an issue of domestic violence between O.J.
Simpson and Nicole Brown Simpson?

MR. KELLY: Objection. Argumentative, irrelevant, compound.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. BAKER: On what grounds, Your Honor?

THE COURT: Grounds Mr. Kelly stated.

Q. Now, you felt that the -- the evidence that there could be an
emergency inside the house was based upon how the vehicle was parked,
the Bronco, that was part of it, right?

MR. KELLY: Objection, relevance.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Your belief that there was an emergency -- your
state of mind that there was an emergency, was based upon a finding by
Detective Fuhrman of a blood spot over the left door handle, a spot
that you indicated was human blood over the left door handle of the
Bronco, true?

MR. KELLY: Objection. Once again I'd refer to your prior ruling.

THE COURT: Probable cause is not an issue.

You may inquire of this witness what he saw, what he did. I have
allowed you this much to explain why he's there.

Now, let's get on with it. I've already ruled.

MR. BAKER: As I indicated, Your Honor, his state of mind is relevant
relative to a rush to judgment. That's what we're getting to here.

THE COURT: You can argue that. You've had all the preliminaries up to
here.

Now you may inquire as to what he saw and did.

MR. P. BAKER: 108.

(Exhibit 108 displayed.)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You see on the monitor Exhibit 108?

A. Yes, sir, I can see that.

Q. And when you -- you went -- you were called to the Ford Bronco by
Mark Fuhrman sometime before 5:45 when he went over the wall, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And Mark Fuhrman was the one that discovered or purportedly
discovered this mark above the left door handle on the Bronco, right?

A. Yes.

Q. And you can -- can you see that at all, can you see any mark on
that door handle in that photograph, 108, that's on the monitor, sir?

A. No, I can't see it, no.

Q. At 5:45 in the morning it was dark, was it not?

A. Yes, it was dark.

MR. BAKER: Show him the other one.

MR. P. BAKER: 109.

(Exhibit 2249 displayed.)

MR. BAKER: Can you focus that a little better.

MR. P. BAKER: There we go.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, is what is on 109, that is on a ruler that has
Mr. Rokahr's name on it, is that the mark that Detective Fuhrman
pointed out to you in the dark on the morning of June 13, 1994?

A. Yes.

Q. And it is something, what, 3/8th of an inch long?

A. I'll accept that representation. I can't tell from here.

Q. A 16th of an inch high, an elliptical shape?

A. Elliptical.

MR. KELLY: Objection.

THE COURT: Excuse me.

MR. KELLY: Objection, no foundation unless this witness can testify as
to the exact dimensions.

Actually, I'll withdraw it, if you can answer it.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) That's the mark that you say Detective Fuhrman
pointed out to you before the request was made for him to go over the
wall, right?

MR. PETROCELLI: I'm going to object, Your Honor. It's one thing to
testify what he saw and did. He keeps tying it into the same issue.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. PETROCELLI: He ought to be admonished. This is now the 30th time.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, that was -- that spot was of significance to
you, Mr. Vannatter?

MR. KELLY: Objection, argumentative in terms of significance. We're
going back to the same thing again, Your Honor, in terms of what the
significance was.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. Yes.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) And you thought that that spot that we have on the
TV monitor on photo 109 was human blood, right?

A. I -- yes, I did.

Q. And before Detective Fuhrman and the rest of the three of you
detectives entered Mr. Simpson's property, you saw absolutely nothing
else that you believed was or could have been human blood, true?

A. Before we entered the property?

Q. That's right.

A. No, sir, I didn't.

Q. And did that spot on Exhibit 109 give rise in your mind to the fact
that there was a possible hostage situation, that somebody was
injured, bleeding or dying inside the Simpson property?

MR. KELLY: Objection, asked and answered, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You thought that the Bronco was parked askew; is
that right?

MR. KELLY: Objection, asked and answered, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. BAKER: Put up the photo, please.

MR. LEONARD: Mr. Baker, I think the plaintiffs have a readily
available copy of that photograph.

MR. BAKER: I thought we had that.

MR. LEONARD: Young Baker can't find it.

THE COURT: Take a 10-minute recess, ladies and gentlemen.

(Recess.)

(Jurors resumed their respective seats.)

THE CLERK: Your Honor, for the record, the exhibit that was referred
to as Exhibit 109 is not Exhibit 109. We already have a 109. This is a
new exhibit, it's marked as 2249, defense exhibit.

THE COURT REPORTER: 2249?

THE CLERK: Correct.

(The instrument herein described as a photo with a ruler with the name
Rokahr on it, and a blood spot on the door handle of the Bronco was
marked for identification as Defendants' Exhibit No. 2249.)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) All right.

Now, your concern prior to 5:45 was -- we talked about the spot, and
you also had a concern about the way that the Bronco was parked,
correct?

MR. KELLY: Objection, asked and answered, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Let's get over the hump.

MR. P. BAKER: 2038.

(Exhibit 2038 displayed.)

(The instrument herein described as a photograph of the back view of
the Bronco was marked for identification as Defendants' Exhibit No.
2038.)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, on the monitor is 2038. That is a picture of
how the Bronco was parked on -- in the early morning hours of June 13,
1994, right?

A. Yes.

Q. Was the back of the vehicle, in your opinion, jutting out in the
street?

A. The back of the vehicle was parked farther from the curb than the
front of the vehicle.

Q. Was the back of the vehicle in your opinion jutting out into the
middle of Rockingham?

A. In the middle of Rockingham, absolutely not. The vehicle appeared
to be hastily parked.

Q. And you determined that it was hastily parked from the location
that it's in?

A. It appeared to me to be hastily parked, yes, sir.

Q. And the -- the white area that we see down by the tires, that's a
concrete apron before the asphalt starts, is it not?

A. Yes.

Q. And would you agree with me that the front right tire is halfway
onto that concrete apron?

A. Yes.

Q. And that the back tire is adjacent or an inch away from that apron?

A. I didn't measure it. It's not sitting on the apron. It is away from
the apron.

Q. Tires on that vehicle, what, about 7, 8 inches wide?

A. Probably, yes.

Q. So that the difference would be what, 3, 4 inches, between where
the front tire is on the apron and the back tire is not on the apron?

A. I guess that's possible. I didn't know what the measure of it was.

Q. And that, of course, in your professional opinion of being a
detective for 23 years, indicated to you that the vehicle was hastily
parked as contrasted to anything else, right?

A. It appeared to be hastily parked to me, yes.

Q. That's the only thing that would give you any impression of a
hastily parked vehicle, is the difference of 3 or 4 inches between the
front and the back tires on the concrete apron at 360 North
Rockingham, right?

MR. KELLY: Objection, misstates his testimony. He said he didn't even
have any occasion as to measurements; he'd just be guessing.

MR. PETROCELLI: Also barred by ruling number 15. It's irrelevant.

THE COURT: You may testify whether it was hastily parked, period.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) That was the basis of your professional opinion as
an LAPD officer -- detective of 23 years, that the 4 or so inches in
difference between where the front right tire was parked on the apron,
and the back tire was not on the apron, that's the only thing you saw
that led you to that conclusion, right?

A. It appeared that the vehicle had been pulled into the curb and not
leveled up, hastily parked, someone pulled in and got out.

Q. And that, of course, couldn't have been done in a -- in a fashion
that was over a period of time, that difference is, in your
professional opinion, hastily parked?

MR. KELLY: Objection, argumentative, speculative, irrelevant.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, based upon the location of the Bronco as seen
in this exhibit, and based upon the spot that we talked about earlier,
you then entered into a discussion with Detective Tom Lange concerning
entering the premises of Mr. Simpson, right?

MR. KELLY: Objection, misstates his testimony, Your Honor, once again.
Irrelevant.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, it goes to, obviously, this witness's
credibility, sir.

THE COURT: I'll sustain the objection. You may inquire as to what he
did.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) The next thing that you did after the determination
that there was a spot that could have been human blood -- you
certainly didn't know that at the time, right?

A. No, I didn't know that.

Q. And that -- that blood, by the way, was never determined to be
human blood by SID or any -- any scientific investigation done by SID,
isn't that true?

MR. KELLY: Objection, calls for hearsay if he knows, plus relevance,
Your Honor.

THE COURT: Okay. Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Well, you then have a discussion -- after you viewed
the location of the vehicle and you viewed the spot, you have a
discussion with Lange and you decide what we discussed earlier, that
there was an emergency situation in that house, right?

MR. KELLY: Objection, asked and answered, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You then ordered Fuhrman to go over the wall, did
you not?

MR. KELLY: Objection, asked and answered, misstates his repeated
testimony as to he didn't order.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Is it your -- is it your testimony you didn't order
him over the wall?

THE COURT: I sustained the objection. He explained what he did
already. And we're repeating it.

MR. BAKER: Respectfully, Your Honor, this is --

MR. PETROCELLI: I'd --

MR. BAKER: This is cross-examination.

THE COURT: You examined him on this very point.

Q. Now, in view of the fact that there was a -- was a possible
emergency in the Simpson property, I take it that after Detective
Fuhrman gets over the wall and gets over the gate, that you all have
your guns drawn, right?

A. No.

Q. Not a gun drawn, is there?

A. Not to my knowledge.

Q. A dog sitting on the front lawn hadn't moved, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. The dog moved later, didn't it?

A. We actually walked up and petted the dog.

Q. So it looked like an emergency situation, when you looked through
and saw that dog in there, right?

MR. KELLY: Objection, argumentative, irrelevant again.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. You did go to the front door, and no one has their guns drawn
whatsoever, true?

A. That's true.

Q. You rang the door bell, and there was no answer, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And you kind of had a hunch there would be no answer because you
rung the buzzer and you heard the phone ring from outside; isn't that
correct?

MR. KELLY: Objection as to what his hunch was.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) It was your state of mind that you didn't anticipate
when you went to the front door that anyone would answer, correct?

MR. KELLY: Objection as to the relevance of his state of mind.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) After you got to the front door, you walked around
the north side of the house, did you not, sir?

A. Yes.

Q. And you went to the guest area, in the back of the house, along the
south side, true?

A. Yes.

Q. And you and other detectives knocked on the door of what turned out
to be Mr. Kaelin's room, true?

A. Other detective -- detective did, yes.

Q. Had you first knocked on any of the glass sliding doors that are in
the back of Mr. Simpson's house or to the -- around the pool area?

A. I believe that was done by one of the other detectives. I didn't.

Q. You don't have any recollection of watching that occur?

A. I was -- I was looking around. I believe it was done by someone,
but I didn't do it.

Q. All right.

And so were you in the little area --

MR. BAKER: Phil, can we get that blow-up of the diagrammatic of
Rockingham --

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Were you in the area right in front of the guest
room of Mr. Kaelin, when the door was knocked upon?

A. I was in the area of -- of the front door.

Q. Of the door of Mr. Kaelin's room?

A. As I recall, I was standing -- there were steps that went down to
the walkway in front, and I was standing up on the top of the steps.

Q. And Mr. Kaelin ultimately opened the door, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And I assume that the four of you identified yourself as police
department officers, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And you heard Mr. Kaelin indicate what happened, did O.J.'s flight
-- did O.J.'s plane go down? You heard that, did you not?

A. No, I never heard that.

Q. Well, did you hear Mr. Kaelin say anything, at anytime before 6:15
in the morning, about the flight of Mr. Simpson, you personally?

MR. KELLY: Objection, calls for hearsay, except for yes or no answer,
Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. The first he told me about -- or the first I heard about a flight
was when I was directed to him by Mr. Fuhrman and I talked to him.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) So it's your testimony then that when Mr. Kaelin
opened the door, the first words out of his mouth were simply not
anything to the effect that what happened, did O.J.'s plane go down,
nothing like that occurred, because you would have heard that,
standing on the step right in front of the door, true?

MR. KELLY: Objection as to the form, calls for speculation, and
misstates his testimony; said he heard no statement by Mr. Kaelin when
he opened the door.

THE COURT: Sustained. That wasn't his testimony.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You heard nothing from Mr. Kaelin that -- after the
police officers identified themselves, that indicated a statement,
question; what happened, did O.J.'s plane go down? Never heard
anything about that out at the guest house, just after Mr. Kaelin had
opened the door and the officers identified themselves, true?

MR. KELLY: Objection, asked and answered, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. No, I never heard that.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) And you -- they were directed to -- strike that.

No officer had any weapons drawn when you were back there by Mr.
Kaelin's room, correct?

A. Not to my knowledge.

Q. Then, you went to Arnelle Simpson's room, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And in the back of your mind, I take it, there was still this
possibility that this could be a second murder scene, there could be a
homicide, somebody dead, or some kidnapping or hostage on the premise,
correct?

MR. KELLY: Objection, relevance.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Did you ask anybody else to draw their weapons
before you went to Mr. Kaelin's room?

A. No.

Q. Did you -- after you went to Arnelle Simpson's room, did you
believe that there was still an emergency situation on the property of
O.J. Simpson?

MR. KELLY: Objection. Same objection in terms of the circumstances and
the witness's state of mind.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Once you got to the guest house where Arnelle
Simpson was -- that was the second guest room in the back of the
house, correct?

A. I believe that's correct, yes, it was the second one.

Q. And once you got there, did you -- was there -- How many detectives
were there?

A. I believe three.

Q. And Fuhrman was left with Kato Kaelin, right?

A. Fuhrman stayed with Kaelin, yes.

Q. And when Fuhrman was with Kato Kaelin, initially, were you still
there?

A. No, I went to Arnelle Simpson's door.

Q. And now, when you went to Arnelle Simpson's room, it was still your
belief that Mr. Simpson was not a suspect, right?

MR. KELLY: Objection. Same objection.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) After you aroused Arnelle Simpson -- there were
three of you; that is Phillips, Lange, and yourself, went to Arnelle's
door and knocked on her door; is that right?

A. Yes.

Q. And Fuhrman was left alone with Kato Kaelin, right?

A. Yes.

Q. And then, after that occurred, you went back down the alleyway --
the walkway rather, and picked up Detective Fuhrman and Kato Kaelin
and went in the house, true?

A. No, that's not true. I don't recall Kato Kaelin and Fuhrman being
with us when we entered the house.

Q. All right.

So it was you and the other three detectives; is that your
recollection?

A. Me and the other two.

Q. I'm sorry. The other two detectives and Arnelle, right?

A. That's correct, yes.

Q. And you went down -- you went down the walkway, correct, from
Arnelle's room, up the stairs?

A. Yes.

Q. And did you, in fact, go in the back entrance of the house?

A. That's correct, we did.

Q. And is it your testimony that Arnelle Simpson had a key to get into
that back door?

A. I asked her if she had a key. She opened it with a key.

Q. And is it your testimony, Detective Vannatter, that she turned off
the alarm before she went in with a keypad on the east side of that
house and that back entrance?

A. I don't recall her turning off the alarm.

Q. Never occurred, right?

A. I don't know. I don't recall seeing her turning off an alarm.

Q. It's your testimony that Arnelle Simpson and you, and the other
three detectives, opened the door that is indicated on whatever
exhibit --

MR. P. BAKER: 145.

(Exhibit 145 displayed.)

(The instrument herein described as a photograph of the glove found at
360 North Rockingham Avenue on June 13, 1994, was marked for
identification as Defendants' Exhibit No. 145.)

Q. At the southeast opening to the -- to the property, correct?

A. That's what occurred. Arnelle Simpson opened the door.

Q. And no alarm went off?

MR. KELLY: Objection, asked and answered.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. I never heard an alarm.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) And you didn't walk around the north side of the
property back onto the driveway and enter the front entrance after
Arnelle Simpson pushed off the alarm, correct?

A. No.

Q. You're sure of that?

A. I'm positive of that.

Q. Now, in terms of your being positive of that -- Well strike that.
When you went in the house, I take it by this time, because of the
situation you previously described to us, the officers had their
weapons drawn, correct?

A. I didn't have my weapon drawn.

Q. In fact, none of you did, did you?

A. Not to my knowledge, no.

Q. In fact, you let Arnelle Simpson go into the house first, didn't
you?

A. I can -- I can hear you very well.

Yes, I did, she opened the door.

Q. You'll hear a lot.

And you let her go in first, into this emergency situation, right?

MR. KELLY: Same objection, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Nobody proceeded into the house to do any
investigation about any emergency as Los Angeles Police Officers,
before Arnelle Simpson was allowed to go into the house, true?

MR. KELLY: Objection.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. KELLY: Your Honor, I'd ask Mr. Baker to keep -- not keep
predicating his questions about this emergency situation. He's been
cautioned on it before.

THE COURT: Sustained the objection.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) So you don't recall when Mark Fuhrman came into the
house, after you had allowed Arnelle Simpson to go into the house,
before any LAPD detective, true?

A. The first time I saw him in the house was after I had asked Arnelle
to show me the -- the maid's quarters. I checked the maid's quarters
to make sure everything was okay there.

Q. So you asked Arnelle to show you the maid's quarters, right?

A. That's correct.

Q. And you were concerned perhaps something was wrong in the maid's
quarters, right.

A. I didn't know.

Q. You were concerned perhaps something was wrong in the maid's
quarters?

A. That was a possibility. I didn't know.

Q. And, in fact, you let Arnelle walk into the maid's quarters room in
front of you at that time, didn't you, Detective Vannatter?

A. Yes, sir, I did.

Q. I take it your concern wasn't very great?

MR. KELLY: Objection. Ask that that comment be stricken.

THE COURT: Stricken.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Then did you take -- did you then, I take it, go
upstairs and investigate the upstairs portion of Mr. Simpson's house?

A. Did I? No, I did not.

Q. And what you did was, you sat Arnelle down and chatted with her,
correct?

A. I did not.

Q. You waited until Kato Kaelin got there, then you sat him down and
chatted with him, right?

A. After he was brought to me, yes.

Q. And he was brought to you by whom?

A. Mark Fuhrman.

Q. Where were you?

A. I was leaving the kitchen area to walk back into the bar area to
shine my light around the bottom floor and make sure everything was
okay when he approached me.

Q. The bar area is the area, according to your testimony, you just
walked through, is it not?

A. That's correct.

Q. Are you telling us that when you walked through the bar area with
Arnelle Simpson and the other three detectives, you didn't turn the
lights on?

A. I don't recall the lights being turned on until we got into the
kitchen area.

Q. So you walked through the bar area with no lights on, with Arnelle
Simpson leading three detectives of the LAPD into the kitchen area,
and then turning lights on in the kitchen area?

A. I believe that's correct, yes.

Q. So you walked through the bar area, not knowing what was in there
'cause you'd never been there before, correct?

A. Never been there.

Q. And you walked through the dining room area and you never been
there before, correct?

A. I'd never been to the location in my life.

Q. And so, there was no lights on until you walked into the kitchen of
the residence, and turned the lights on in the kitchen, right?

A. There was a light on in the front portion of the house that
illuminated part of the area there.

Q. When you say light on in the front portion of the house, you are
talking about the west portion of the house?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, you spent some time there on June 13, 1994, did you not, sir?

A. At what point, sir?

Q. Well, from the point of 5 to 7:30 you were at 360 North Rockingham,
were you not?

A. I was outside, yes, until about 5:45, and then I was inside from
about 5:45, and on the grounds until approximately 7:30, yes.

Q. All right.

And you were in the area that includes the family room of Mr. Simpson,
correct?

A. In the area -- I -- I never went totally into the area. I shined my
flashlight around, and it appeared okay, and I didn't go in there.

Q. Well, the area where the bar is, isn't that the area where you
interviewed Kato Kaelin?

A. Yes.

Q. The family area is right behind it, and adjacent to it, is it not?

A. Yes, it is.

Q. Are you telling us you never went into that area?

A. I don't think I did. After -- after the maid was accounted for, and
Mr. Simpson was accounted for, there was no need for me to go into the
house anymore.

Q. Now, let's go back -- the maid was accounted for, it was your
testimony?

A. Yes, I believe -- or Arnelle told me that the maid was not working,
and it appeared to be the -- the room appeared to be made up, and in
good order, and everything seemed fine.

Q. Now, it's your testimony Arnelle told you that the maid was not
working; that's your testimony, sir?

A. That's a possibility. I don't recall every word that was said at
the scene. But everything appeared to be in order -- in order. Mr.
Simpson was accounted for, and everything seemed fine.

Q. In fact, Arnelle never told you where the maid was, and that's why
you went in the maid's room, isn't that true?

A. I asked Arnelle where the maid's room was, so I could check the
maid's room.

Q. Let me see if I can make my question so you can understand it.

Arnelle Simpson never told you that the maid was there or not there,
and that's the reason you proceeded to the maid's room, true or
untrue?

A. Your -- no, that's not a true statement. I asked her where the
maid's room was because I wanted to physically check it, because I had
been told by Westec that there was a full-time, live-in maid at the
house.

Q. You don't have a recollection as you sit here now, although you've
told the jury that Arnelle told you the maid was taken care of, you
have no recollection of her ever saying that, do you, sir?

A. I don't have a total recollection of that, no.

Q. Now, in terms of your interrogation of Kato Kaelin, he was a
suspect, wasn't he?

MR. KELLY: Objection as to relevance, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. He was a potential suspect.

Q. Well, let me ask you this: Is Mr. Simpson a potential suspect when
you left 875 South Bundy at 5:00 a.m. in the morning?

A. Of course he was. Anybody who had personal contact with any of the
victims could have been a potential suspect.

Q. He was under suspicion for the murders when you left at 5 o'clock
in the morning on June 13, 1994, that is, O.J. Simpson, true?

A. Not true.

MR. KELLY: Objection, asked and answered repeatedly.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, when -- as I understand it, then, Detective
Fuhrman was the person who had questioned Kato Kaelin out in his room,
correct?

A. Yes. To my knowledge, he had done that, yes.

Q. Yeah. He had gotten some information from him, had he not?

A. I assumed he did, yes. I wasn't there when he was talking with him.

Q. And so you don't know what transpired between Mr. Kaelin and Mark
Fuhrman out in his guest room at all, do you?

A. I do not, no.

Q. And so I take it that it would be good LAPD procedure to have Mr.
Fuhrman continue the interrogation of Kato Kaelin because he already
has information that he wouldn't have to go over again, true?

MR. KELLY: Objection, relevance, argumentative, calls for speculation.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) How long after Mr. -- Detective Fuhrman lateralled
(sic) Kato Kaelin to you to interrogate, was he out of sight, that is,
Mark Fuhrman?

A. I would have to guess at that and -- and I think maybe 10 minutes
or something like that. I'm not positive on that.

Q. Now, during -- actually, he was gone from 6 o'clock, and you had
previously testified that he came back to tell you about his discovery
of this purported glove on the south side of Mr. Simpson's residence
between 6:15 and 6:30, right?

A. That's possible, yes.

Q. And so he was out of sight anywhere between 15 and 30 minutes at
the Simpson property, true?

A. That's possible.

MR. KELLY: Objection to the form in terms of this "out of sight."

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Well, you and Detective Phillips and Detective Lange
have gotten together more than once to talk about exactly the time
period we are talking about, isn't that true, in front of the D.A.'s,
correct, sir?

MR. KELLY: Objection as to the form. Which time period, Your Honor.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) From 6 o'clock in the morning till 6:30, correct?

MR. KELLY: Objection, calls for hearsay.

THE COURT: You may answer yes or no.

A. I have talked with the D.A. regarding the time frame, yes.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) And you've done it -- you've also talked to
Detective Phillips and Detective Lange about this particular time
frame and the whereabouts of Mark Fuhrman during that period, isn't
that true, sir?

A. Well, Detective Lange was my partner. I talked to him every day.

Q. Maybe you didn't understand the question. You want me to reask it?

A. Regarding Mark Fuhrman?

Q. Regarding Mark Fuhrman and his whereabouts from 6 o'clock to 6:30
on June 13, 1994, you all got together and talked about where Mark
Fuhrman was during that period, did you not?

MR. KELLY: Objection, calls for hearsay except for yes or no.

THE COURT: Yes or no.

A. I don't think I ever had a conversation like that.

Q. Never talked to Marcia Clark, Bill Hodgman, Chris Darden or any of
them about this time period, in the presence of the other detectives,
correct?

A. That's possible. I may have -- I know I personally had
conversations with them about the events that occurred, and what I
knew, and what I did.

Q. All right.

Now, let's -- as I understand it, then, you are in the bar area
talking to Kato Kaelin, and in the kitchen area is Detectives Phillips
and Lange with Arnelle Simpson, right?

A. To my knowledge, that's the way it was, yes.

Q. And up until this point in time, is it your testimony, and this
point in time being at approximately 6 a.m. on June 13, 1994, that
there had been no revelation to Arnelle Simpson that her stepmother
had been murdered?

A. I -- I don't know when she was informed. I was not aware of when
she was informed.

Q. So as I understand it, she was in your presence from the time that
you knocked on her door, then -- you allowed her obviously to put some
clothes on, I assume?

A. Yes.

Q. And after that, she walked out with you down the walkway and into,
as you say, the back or east entrance, southeast entrance to the
house, and then you stayed in the bar area, or did you go to the
kitchen area with her?

A. She led me directly to the maid's room, and after I looked at the
maid's room, I walked back through, walked through the kitchen and
went into the bar area.

Q. Where's the maid's room?

A. It would be off to the -- let me acclimate -- off to the south of
the kitchen, there's a laundry room there, and the maid's room
connects with the laundry room.

Q. Essentially, where that depiction of a door is in the south side of
the premises of Rockingham, right here (indicating to diagram)?

A. Essentially, yes.

Q. Then, sir, you went back into -- left Arnelle, and went back into
the bar area, and was Kato being brought in at that point in time?

A. Shortly after I entered there, I was approached by Fuhrman, yes.

Q. Why did you go back into that area if Kato wasn't there?

MR. KELLY: Objection, argumentative, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. I think I answered that before. It was my intention to look into
the rooms, and make sure everything was okay.

Q. Now, at this point in time, had you heard anything about any noises
that had been reported by Kato Kaelin? And we're talking now about 6
o'clock in the morning on June 13, 1994.

MR. KELLY: Objection, calls for hearsay.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. No, I had not heard anything about that.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) So you didn't know anything about noises when Kato
Kaelin was given to you to question, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. And did Mark Fuhrman tell you that Kato Kaelin had described to him
some noises?

MR. KELLY: Objection, calls for hearsay, Your Honor.

THE COURT: You may answer yes or no.

MR. KELLY: It also has to be put in a time frame, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. I don't honestly know that. I know he told me that I should talk to
this guy and hear what he had to say.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Mr. Vannatter, you were informed in the process of
turning over Kaelin for you to question, that Kaelin had informed
Fuhrman of some noises and Fuhrman was going to go out to investigate,
isn't that true, sir?

A. I -- again -- I think I just answered that. I don't honestly know
that. I do recall him telling me that I should talk to the man and
hear what he had to say.

Q. Isn't it true that you were told by Fuhrman that he was going to go
investigate some noises, true or untrue?

A. I -- that's a possibility. I don't recall that exact conversation,
but that could have happened.

Q. And now you had -- from the time Mr. Fuhrman went over the gate and
opened the gate for the other three detectives, approximately 10 to 15
minutes had elapsed, correct?

A. An approximation, yes.

Q. And during that 10 to 15 minutes, you certainly had not gone
upstairs at any point in time, during that 10 to 15 minutes, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. You hadn't gone into the living room, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. Hadn't gone into the downstairs office, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And you had then been asked to talk to Kato Kaelin, and you were
informed that Mark Fuhrman was going to go investigate, correct?

A. I don't know whether that's correct or not. As I said, again, I
don't recall that conversation. It could have occurred.

Q. Well, let me ask you this: Did Mark Fuhrman ask you for any backup
because he was going to go try to determine the source of any noises
that had been reported to him by Kato Kaelin?

MR. KELLY: Objection, calls for hearsay, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Did anybody leave with Detective Fuhrman when he
left the premises, or the interior portion of the house?

MR. KELLY: Objection, calls for speculation, except for this officer's
observations, I'd object to the form of the question, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Rephrase it.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) To your knowledge, did any other detective leave the
interior of Mr. Simpson's house when Fuhrman exited the house?

MR. KELLY: Same objection. Calls for speculation unless directed to
his own observations, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Did you see? You may answer that.

THE WITNESS: Did I see anyone leave with him?

THE COURT: Yes.

THE WITNESS: No, Your Honor, I didn't.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) And did you see Mark Fuhrman draw his weapon as he
left the interior premises of the house?

A. I didn't see him leave the house. I don't know whether he did or
not.

Q. Well, you didn't see him walk out the back southeast exit?

A. I -- I don't know how he exited the house. I didn't see him leave
the house.

Q. Don't know if he went out the front, that is, the kitchen nook
area?

MR. KELLY: Objection, calls for speculation. He indicated he didn't
see him leave the house.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, you had some discussions with the other
officers who were interrogating Arnelle, did you not, after you had
interrogated Kato Kaelin?

MR. KELLY: Objection, misstates his testimony. He never indicated
anybody was being interrogated at all.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. I had discussions with Detective Lange all the time. He was my
partner.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) And at the time that this -- inside Mr. Simpson's
house is, and the questioning of Arnelle Simpson, and the questioning
of Kato Kaelin taking place, you subsequently learned that nobody knew
exactly where Mark Fuhrman was, correct?

MR. KELLY: Objection, calls for hearsay.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, up until 6:30 on the morning of June 13, 1994,
there were four detectives and only one detective had discovered any
evidence, that being Mark Fuhrman, right?

MR. KELLY: Objection, calls for an opinion on this witness's part, and
it is argumentative.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. That's my understanding of it, yes.

Q. And that was the purported blood spot on the door, right?

A. And I believe the glove had been discovered by 6:30 in the morning.

Q. We'll get into the glove.

And so then, Detective Fuhrman comes back to you and tells you that he
has made yet another discovery on the Simpson property, that being
this glove, right?

MR. KELLY: Objection, calls for hearsay, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: Yes.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) And so you then go out, walk around the front of the
garage, down the south side of the house, and view this purported
discovery of Mark Fuhrman's, right?

A. I was led there by Mr. Fuhrman, yes.

Q. Was anybody else with you, any other detective?

A. At that point, no.

Q. Did he tell you that he led each detective out there individually?

MR. KELLY: Objection, calls for hearsay.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) To your knowledge, did Mark Fuhrman take each of the
three of you out there individually?

MR. KELLY: Same objection unless it's observations, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. I was informed of that later, yes.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) And obviously if you detectives are walking down the
south side of Mr. Simpson's property in this concrete area --

(Indicating to diagram.)

Q. -- if there were any latent prints, they would be destroyed by your
walking there, by Ron Phillips walking there, and by Tom Lange walking
there, true?

MR. KELLY: Objection, calls for speculation, argumentative, no
foundation, et cetera.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You don't know of any reason why all three of you
couldn't have gone out there, or do you?

MR. KELLY: Objection, argumentative.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, when you went out there at 6:30 in the morning
or thereabouts, it was light, wasn't it?

A. It was getting light, yeah. Dawn was breaking, yes.

Q. In fact, the sunrise was at 5:42 that morning. Take my word for it,
okay.

MR. KELLY: Objection to taking his word.

MR. BAKER: We had a stipulation.

MR. KELLY: That's fine. I'll withdraw the objection, Your Honor.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) So by an hour later -- 45 minutes later, it was
light, was it not, sir?

A. It was, yeah. I could see, yes.

Q. You didn't have your flashlight with you, did you?

A. This was dark along the side because of the foliage alongside.

(Indicating to diagram)

Q. Was the foliage thick along the side?

A. Appeared to be thick to me, yes.

Q. And there was a Cyclone fence there, right?

A. Yes. I believe it was approximately 5 foot high or so.

Q. 5 foot high on the Simpson side of the fence, correct?

A. Yeah, on the south side of his property.

Q. Okay.

But in other words, that fence borders the neighbor's property to the
south of Mr. Simpson's property, correct?

A. I would -- I would make that assumption, yes, sir, because that
would be the property line.

Q. And did you ever go into the property to the south -- I believe
it's the Salingers, and look to see whether or not it was 7 feet from
their driveway to the top of that fence or more?

A. No, sir, I didn't.

Q. Wasn't anything you investigated, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. Now, in terms of your going out to where Mark Fuhrman said he had
discovered the glove; you walked out, how close did you get to the
glove?

A. Four to five feet.

Q. That would be four to five feet to the west of the glove?

A. That's correct.

Q. And how long did you view the glove?

A. Short period of time. I don't know exactly how long.

Q. Did you see any blood drops around the glove?

A. No.

Q. Did you see any trail of blood from the glove heading either south
towards either of the entrances that border the south side of the
house or north towards the air conditioner?

A. No.

Q. Did you see anything that remotely appeared to be insect activity
on the glove, any bugs crawling on it, anything of that nature?

A. I don't recall seeing any insect activity on it.

Q. Did you see any dirt at all on the glove?

A. It appeared to be a bloody glove. There appeared to be blood on it.
There could have been dirt mixed into the glove. I don't know. It
appeared to be a bloody glove.

Q. Now, from five feet or six feet to the west of the glove, you
viewed that and saw that there was blood on it, right?

A. Appeared to be blood on it, yes.

Q. And -- And you were five feet south, and you're about what, six
feet tall?

A. Yeah, approximately.

Q. All right.

And in this -- on this particular morning, would you say that you
viewed blood that you thought was on that glove from that distance?

A. I'm saying it appeared to be blood on the glove, yes.

Q. It's your testimony here in this courtroom, that you thought from
your vantage point you could tell it was human blood on that glove,
correct?

A. It appeared to be blood on the glove. It appeared to be a bloody
glove.

Q. So, being a detective of 23 years, I take it that you looked around
the surrounding area to see if there was any other element that looked
like blood in the area, true?

A. That's true.

Q. And you found absolutely none, correct?

A. That's true.

Q. And you obviously, because you had looked at a glove at 875 South
Bundy between 4 and 5 o'clock in the morning, looked to see whether or
not the shrubbery had been broken over on the south side of the fence,
whether there were any branches that were down indicating somebody had
recently come through this heavily wooded or hedged area, did you not?

A. At the Rockingham location?

Q. Yes.

A. There didn't appear to be any evidence, that I saw, of anyone that
had come through the heavy foliage there.

Q. All right.

I take it, sir, that this was because you are aware of the glove at
875 South Bundy when it was brought to you, a major discovery by Mark
Fuhrman, was it not?

A. It was a piece of evidence.

Q. Well, now, Mr. Vannatter, you were aware that this was a high
visibility, high publicity case long before you ever got to
Rockingham, correct?

A. I was aware that it had the potential, but the only difference
between this case and any other murder case I worked as a Los Angeles
Police Officer is the media coverage of this case. Every case, every
murder case has the same importance to me regardless of who's involved
in it.

Q. You were aware that there was going to be immense pressure put on
the LAPD to find a suspect in this case, certainly before you ever got
to Rockingham, correct?

MR. KELLY: Objection, argumentative, calls for speculation, no
foundation.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. There's immense pressure on every case to come to a successful
conclusion.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) And there is much more pressure put on the LAPD to
get a suspect, and to arrest a suspect, in a high profile case than
there is in a case where the victims are unknown by anybody; you would
agree with that?

A. That may be on the higher echelon of the LAPD. That never affected
me in my work.

Q. Never filtered down. It never affected you at all, right?

A. Never.

Q. Not even in the Christian -- did you investigate the Christian
Brando case?

A. I did not.

Q. The linkage in your mind, at 6:30 in the morning, was immediate
when Mark Fuhrman says I have found a glove in the south area of Mr.
Simpson's estate, was it not, sir?

A. What do you mean by the linkage, you mean did he become a suspect?

Q. Did you, in your own mind, think one glove Bundy, one glove
Rockingham, wow, anything like that?

A. Sure, I did.

MR. KELLY: Objection. His state of mind with regard to that is
irrelevant.

THE COURT: Overruled at this point.

A. Sure, I did. He became a suspect at that point.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Instantly, he is a very serious suspect, that is
O.J. Simpson, right?

A. He became a suspect, a viable suspect, yeah.

Q. He became instantly the suspect, did he not, sir?

A. He became a viable suspect at that point.

Q. Now, I want to go back to your observations on the morning of June
13, 1994.

Now, the chain link fence comes -- goes up as you suggest, about five
feet above ground level on the Simpson side of the fence, correct?

A. Yeah, I believe that's correct.

Q. And then there are bushes that have become -- it's become heavily
wooded in that area, hasn't it?

A. Yeah. It has heavy foliage, yes.

Q. And the trunks -- what type of plant is that, do you know?

A. No, I don't.

Q. Eugenia. The Eugenia bushes have trunks on them, some of them, four
and five inches thick in that area, correct?

MR. PETROCELLI: Your Honor --

MR. KELLY: Objection as to this area. If he wants to ask a specific
question about a location -- we're just talking about an area right
now.

MR. PETROCELLI: He said he wasn't closer than four to five feet from
the glove.

THE COURT: Overruled.

You may inquire.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) The area I'm talking about is the area of the
Eugenia bushes that go down the south side of Mr. Simpson's property.

And let's just take it from where the -- well, just the garage area,
down to where the glove was viewed by you.

A. I'll accept that they're Eugenia. It's possible that they had big
trunks. I don't -- I don't know how big they were.

Q. But certainly, when you were there, you looked very closely, based
upon your 23 years of being an LAPD detective, to make the
determination as to if someone had used that area to enter the
property, that is coming over the Cyclone fence and through the
Eugenia bushes onto the concrete walkway, true?

A. I didn't see any evidence of that west of the glove, and I never
went east of the glove to protect the possible other evidence that may
be there for the criminalist.

Q. And you certainly shined your flashlight in the area east of the
glove to see if there was any branches or any elements of a
disturbance, correct?

A. I didn't see anything, any disturbance.

Q. In fact, you shined your lights and saw cobwebs in the area east of
where the glove was located, indicating that no one had come through
there; isn't that true, sir?

A. No, that's not true.

Q. Did you have a discussion with Mark Fuhrman that he had gone into
that area, and had been met by cobwebs in the area to the east of
where the glove was located?

MR. KELLY: Objection, calls for hearsay.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) In terms of your investigation of this particular
area, sir, I take it that you gathered information from all sources,
to come to your own opinions and conclusions, did you not, sir?

A. I tried to, yes.

Q. And one of those sources of information is Mark Fuhrman, because he
had been back there and purportedly had been there first and found the
glove, true?

A. True.

Q. And so all of this information flow is part of what you used to
come to some conclusions and opinions relative to your detective work,
true?

A. True.

Q. And you did discuss with Mark Fuhrman that there were cobwebs on
the east side of where the glove was located, indicating that
absolutely no one had come from east to west, correct?

MR. KELLY: Objection. Same objection. Still calls for hearsay, Your
Honor.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) And you went back to that area again on June 13,
1994, after Mark Fuhrman had been into the area and you had been into
the area, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And you had discussions with the other two detectives, who were
also taken back into that area by Mark Fuhrman, that is Tom Lange and
Ron Phillips, true?

A. I did what I did. Whether Tom Lange --

Q. And in those discussions no one ever indicated to you that they saw
any evidence whatsoever that anybody had gone into or through those
Eugenia hedges; isn't that true.

MR. KELLY: Objection, calls for hearsay.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You concluded as a detective of 23 years'
experience, based upon your own observations, your discussions with
Ron Phillips, all the information that you had, that absolutely no one
had come over the Cyclone fencing through the Eugenia hedge because
there was absolutely no evidence of that, correct, sir?

MR. KELLY: Objection, misstates his testimony, Your Honor, also calls
for speculation and hearsay.

THE COURT: Overruled. You may inquire as to what he saw and what he
concluded.

A. I didn't see any evidence of that. However, I don't know how it was
put there. I don't know whether someone came over the fence or walked
back there. That's -- I don't know that.

But I didn't see any evidence of anybody coming over the fence.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You say, you don't know how it was put there. Let's
go back just a moment, for a second.

Those hedges are so thick on the south side of the property, your
observations were at the time -- in the multiple times that you were
on the south side of Mr. Simpson's property on June 13 and thereafter,
that if somebody had come through those hedges, there would have to be
evidence of it, correct?

MR. KELLY: Objection, calls for speculation. He's repeatedly testified
he never got closer than 4 to 5 feet west of the glove in that south
walkway.

A. Other -- I answered this a number of times. I don't believe anybody
came over the fence. I didn't see any evidence of anybody coming over
the fence.

MR. BAKER: Is this a good place, Your Honor?

THE COURT: Yes. Okay.

1:30, ladies and gentlemen. Don't talk about the case. Don't form or
express any opinion.

(At 12:12 P.M. a recess was taken until 1:30 P.M. of the same day.)


SANTA MONICA, CALIFORNIA
MONDAY, DECEMBER 9, 1996
1:45 P.M.

DEPARTMENT NO. WEQ
HON. HIROSHI FUJISAKI, JUDGE

(REGINA D. CHAVEZ, OFFICIAL REPORTER)

(The jurors resumed their respective seats.)

PHILLIP VANNATTER, the witness on the stand at the time of the
luncheon recess, having been previously duly sworn, was examined and
testified further as follows:

DIRECT EXAMINATION (Resumed.) BY MR. BAKER:

Q. Now, when you -- Mr. Vannatter, you went to view that glove, it
appeared to be, to your visualization wet, rather moist, and tacky.
True?

A. It could have been categorized as that, yes. It looked shiny.

Q. It didn't appear to be dry, did it? That is, the blood you were
able to visualize, did not appear to be dry, caked, or cracked, did
it?

A. I didn't know. I didn't get closer than four, five feet to it.

Q. Maybe you visualized the glove -- you saw what you believed was
human blood, or at least blood, on the glove, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And you were close enough to look at it, and see that the
appearance of what you thought was blood, was shiny, and it appeared
to you to have the appearance of being moist and tacky, correct?

A. It could have been moist; it could have been dry. I don't know.

Q. You don't know?

A. It appeared to have shiny areas.

Q. Mr. Vannatter, if you don't know the answer to my question, please
tell me, if you can, answer my question, did it appear to be shiny and
moist and tacky? Yes, no, or I don't know?

A. I don't really know whether it was moist and tacky.

Q. All right.

You never testified before, in any of the forums that you've been in,
that it appeared moist and tacky. True or untrue?

A. I could have.

It had a shine to it that could have indicated that maybe it was
moist.

I don't know. I never touched it. I never got closer than four or five
feet to it.

Q. Did you see Mark Fuhrman pick the glove up?

A. No.

Q. Did you see Mark Fuhrman ever move the glove at Bundy?

A. No.

Q. Did you see Mark Fuhrman ever move the envelope at Bundy?

A. No.

Q. Now, in terms of your analysis, you were kind of lead detective at
the Rockingham scene, right?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And you have absolutely not one note indicating any -- any evidence
that you found at the Rockingham crime scene. Would you agree with
that, true?

A. I didn't write any, but I caused a lot to be written.

Q. You never wrote one note, sir, did you?

A. Personally, I didn't. But I caused a lot to be written.

Q. You caused a lot to be written by Mark Fuhrman, maybe?

A. No, by the criminalist, Dennis Fung.

Q. Let's talk about your observations, sir, before the criminalist
ever got there.

Those were never documented anyplace, were they?

A. No, sir.

Q. And you -- you didn't call the criminalist upon your arrival to
Rockingham, did you?

A. No, I did not.

Q. Any more than you called the criminalist upon your arrival to
Bundy, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. Nor did you call -- well, strike that.

Then, you -- after this glove was viewed, did you find out whether
there were any cuts in that glove?

MR. KELLY: Objection. Calls for hearsay, unless it's his own
observations.

THE COURT: Sustained.

(The instrument herein referred to as board entitled Glove Found at
360 North Rockingham was marked for identification as Defendants'
Exhibit No. 145.)

(Counsel displays board entitled Glove Found at 360 North Rockingham
Avenue, Exhibit 145. June 13, '94.)

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, I'm not offering it for the truth of the matter
asserted.

MR. P. BAKER: That board is 145.

MR. BAKER: I'm not offering that information for the truth of the
matter asserted; I'm offering it for his subsequent conduct.

THE COURT: Okay. Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, did -- From your visualization, can you tell if
there were any cuts in the Rockingham glove?

A. I never saw any.

Q. Subsequently, did you find out that there were cuts in the
Rockingham glove?

MR. KELLY: Objection. Calls for hearsay, unless it's his own
observations.

THE COURT: I previously overruled it because Mr. Baker said he is
offering it for some other purpose.

I'll entertain a motion to strike if that's not established.

A. To this day, I don't know whether there were any cuts in the glove.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You never compared any cuts in the Rockingham glove
to Mr. Simpson's hands, at any time, sir. Is that your testimony?

A. Me?

Q. Yes, you.

A. No, sir, I never did.

Q. All right.

MR. KELLY: Objection. Ask that the previous answers now be stricken
based on that response, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Okay. I think it explains the second answer.

Denied.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, after the glove had been shown to you by Mark
Fuhrman, you then directed Fuhrman to go back to Bundy to compare the
Rockingham glove to the Bundy glove, right?

A. Yes.

Q. And did Fuhrman tell you that he had had his picture taken in close
proximity to the Bundy glove before he had ever been to Rockingham?

MR. KELLY: Objection. Calls for hearsay.

MR. BAKER: It's not being offered --

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. BAKER: It's not being offered for the truth.

THE COURT: I would sustain the objection.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You had no idea, when you sent Fuhrman back to Bundy
to compare the gloves, that Fuhrman had already had his picture taken,
pointing at the glove in close proximity. True or untrue?

MR. KELLY: Same objection.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. That has never occurred.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) And so he never indicated to you, said, well, gee
whiz, that glove looks exactly like the glove that I visualized at
Bundy.

He never said that to you, did he?

MR. KELLY: Objection. Calls for hearsay.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. BAKER: Again, it's not being offered for the truth of the matter,
sir.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) So now, what time is it that you sent Fuhrman back
to -- to Bundy?

A. I believe approximately 6:30 in the morning.

Q. And by now, it was six and a half hours, and there had been no
criminalist, or no investigating at 875 South Bundy. Correct?

A. There had been no -- I don't remember crime-scene investigation.

A canvas of the neighborhood was going on by uniform officers, and a
check of the vehicles in the area was going on.

Q. The actual crime scene where the victims were found, there had been
no investigation into that crime scene, for, now, six and a half
hours. You agree with that?

A. Other than walking through and viewing the evidence that could be
seen, yes, I would agree with that.

Q. And by 6:30 in the morning, did you think it was appropriate to
call a criminalist, Mr. Vannatter?

A. Well, I had one called before that.

Q. You didn't call the criminalist to the Bundy crime scene, did you?

A. No, I didn't.

Q. You called the criminalist to Rockingham, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, in your years of experience, do you believe that it is
appropriate for the criminalist to go from one crime scene to another
crime scene and risk the possibility of contamination?

MR. KELLY: Objection. Relevance, argumentative, calls for speculation.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Well, I take it that you wouldn't have called Dennis
Fung or Andrea Mazzola to go to the Rockingham crime scene, and then
go on to the Bundy crime scene because of the risk of contamination,
correct?

MR. KELLY: Objection. Same objection.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Well, what time did the criminalists finally arrive
at Rockingham?

A. Shortly after 7:00 that morning.

Q. What time did you call them?

A. I think approximately 5:30 to 5:40 that morning.

Q. And so, it took approximately an hour and a half to get there?

A. Yeah. I would say that was close, yes.

Q. And would that be the normal time that criminalists take to respond
to a homicide crime scene?

A. Well, I --

MR. KELLY: Objection to relevance in terms of a normal time to respond
to a crime scene.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. I don't think there would be a normal time. I think it would depend
on the time of day and whether criminalists were working or not
working. And it could vary. It could be from ten minutes to three
hours sometimes.

Q. Well, in terms of your 23 years of experience investigating 200
homicides, I take it there are certain parameters within which
criminalists respond. Is that not true, sir?

Is it ten minutes to three hours? Is that the parameter?

A. It could be -- it could be that, yes. They don't come to every
crime scene; they only come to crime scenes that they're requested to
come to.

Q. And they are generally requested to come to double homicides, are
they not, sir?

A. Maybe, maybe not. I mean --

Q. Those are the only two alternatives, right?

A. Well, that's a decision made by the detective handling that crime
scene, whether he feels he needs a criminalist or doesn't need a
criminalist.

Q. And you felt, approximately 5:30 in the morning, that you needed a
criminalist, not at Bundy, but you needed a criminalist at Rockingham,
right?

A. Yes.

Q. And so the criminalists were called. They got there about 7 o'clock
in the morning.

And you left Rockingham at what time, sir?

A. Approximately 7:30.

Q. And at 7:30, you went back to Bundy?

A. I went back to -- yes, I did.

Q. Now, before you went back to Bundy, were you concerned that the
evidence should be secured at the Rockingham scene?

A. The evidence was secured at the Rockingham scene.

Q. Were you concerned that the glove on the south side of the property
could be possibly lost or have -- have at the -- elimination of hair
and fiber evidence on them?

A. No, I was not concerned about that. It was secured.

Q. All right.

Let me read from your deposition in this case, taken on July 6, 199 --
I'm sorry. It is not your deposition; it is the trial transcript --
July -- preliminary hearing, July 6, 1994. Page 64, line 26 through
line 7 on page 65.

Okay.

Now, you had, by the time you testified on July 6, 1994 -- that was
about three weeks after the murders?

A. That's approximately three weeks, yes.

Q. And you'd already testified at the grand jury proceedings, did you
not, before you ever took the stand in the preliminary hearing?

A. Yes.

Q. And so let me read what you testified to some three weeks after the
murders. "Q. And that --"

MR. KELLY: Line? Line, Mr. Baker? I'm sorry.

MR. BAKER: Pardon me; I gave you the line and page.

MR. KELLY: I'm sorry. Okay.

MR. BAKER: Is that okay?

MR. KELLY: Yes.

MR. BAKER: All right.

Why don't we put it on the Elmo, Phil.

(Portion of transcript referred to was displayed on the Elmo screen.)

"Q. And that glove that you

saw on the south side of the property

that you've already identified in

photographs, you're concerned about the

loss of evidence that you've earlier

identified on that glove?" Your answer: "Oh, definitely.

The glove was in the elements, was

outside. There could possibly be trace

evidence on it, fiber, hair, and what

have you. Also, there was an animal, a

dog, running loose in the residence

lawn; I wanted to make sure it was

protected before I left that scene."

Now, that's what you testified to on July 6, 1994, is it not, sir?

A. Yes. And that's what happened.

Q. And so you were concerned about the glove evidence being protected,
and trace evidence being on the glove, and possibly lost at that time,
were you not?

A. Before I left the scene? Of course.

Q. And you were concerned about the fact that it was a dog that had
been running loose in the front yard that you had seen while you were
there at the Rockingham property, true?

A. Before I left the scene, yes.

Q. And there was a dog at Bundy, was there not?

That's how the crime scene was discovered, isn't that true? Or did you
know that?

MR. PETROCELLI: Objection to compound. I don't know what time frame.

THE COURT: Compound. Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You knew there was a dog at the Bundy crime scene,
as well, did you not?

MR. PETROCELLI: Time frame?

MR. KELLY: Object --

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) On June 13, 1994 did you know there was a dog at the
Bundy crime scene?

MR. PETROCELLI: Time.

MR. KELLY: At what time?

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Anytime you were there, Detective Vannatter.

MR. PETROCELLI: Still vague, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Let's get on with this.

A. There was not a dog there, when I was there at the crime scene.

I knew there had been a dog there previously, yes.

Q. Now, you then went to -- after you had gone to Bundy, you went to
the West LA police station to -- to prepare a search warrant, right?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, you have been on -- on various television shows, protesting
the fact that -- and suggesting that you have never lied, true?

A. I have never lied.

Q. And you said that on -- in front of Tom Brokaw on -- what was it --
March 29, in your interview on Dateline?

A. If that was the date, yes.

Q. Then you said it on subsequent occasions, did you not, sir?

A. And I'll say it right now: I've never lied.

Q. And when you produce a search warrant, as a police officer of 26
years and a detective of 13 years, you know that an affiant, that is,
the person who is swearing under penalty of perjury, that everything
they put in their affidavit is true and correct, is important, do you
not, sir?

A. To the best of my knowledge, yes.

Q. And you know that it is a declaration or affidavit by you, under
penalty of perjury, that carries with it the same force and effect as
your testimony here in this courtroom, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And you knew when you produced the declaration for the search
warrant, that Mr. Simpson, had gone on an expected flight to Chicago
on the early morning hours of June 13, 1994, did you not?

A. No, I did not.

Q. So it's your testimony in this courtroom that, although you
interviewed Kato Kaelin in the bar area of Mr. Simpson's house on June
13, 1994, he never told you about any expected flight of Mr. Simpson;
is that your testimony, sir?

A. That's absolutely correct.

Q. And I take it, as a detective of 23 years, that you would
certainly, after you had known of Mr. Simpson's being a probable
suspect, have interrogated Mr. Kaelin relative to the whereabouts of
Mr. Simpson, correct?

A. I had him interrogated. I had him transferred -- transported to
West LA and interviewed, yes.

Q. Well, you're sitting there with him in the bar area of Mr.
Simpson's family room, as you've testified in this courtroom, Mr.
Fuhrman told you to question Kato Kaelin, right?

A. Yes.

Q. And you questioned Kato Kaelin about the events of the previous
evening, did you not, sir?

A. Partially of the previous evening. He was telling me about what he
had heard, and about the telephone conversation he was having, and
that the limo driver had picked up Mr. Simpson.

Q. So he told you the limo driver had picked up Mr. Simpson?

A. Yes.

Q. So you knew that much, right?

A. Yes.

Q. And put that on the --

MR. P. BAKER: Exhibit 1797.

(The instrument herein referred to as Copy of Search Warrant was
marked for identification as Defendants' Exhibit No. 1797.)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You said in your declaration to obtain a search
warrant for Mr. Simpson's property at 7:30 in the morning, it was
determined that -- it was determined by interviews with Simpson's
daughter and a friend, Brian Kaelin, that Simpson had left on an
unexpected flight to Chicago during the early-morning hours of June
13, 1994, and was last seen at the residence at approximately 2300
hours June 12, 1994.

That's what you said, right?

A. Yes.

Q. And you even included in your own handwriting, based on interviews
of Simpson's daughter and a friend, Brian Kaelin.

That's your handwriting, isn't it?

A. It is.

Q. And that's your initial at the -- up there, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And you knew, as a matter of fact, that, if there's a limo coming
to pick him up, it sure as heck was an expected flight; isn't that
true?

A. No, that's not true.

Q. Well, let me ask you this:

Detective, do you think it was important to ask if the flight was
expected or unexpected?

MR. KELLY: Objection. Calls for speculation, argumentative, Your
Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. I asked where his whereabouts was, and -- and from Kaelin, who
deferred to his daughter. And his daughter gave me the impression, or
indicated that he -- she thought he should be home.

Q. Is it your testimony --

MR. BAKER: Well, Phil, pull up Detective Vannatter's testimony on
March 21, 1995, 19,616.

By the way, the word --

The word that's gone.

(Indicating to Elmo screen no longer displaying document.)

MR. P. BAKER: There we go.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) The words that "he left on unexpected flight," those
are your choice of words, correct?

A. That was my understanding, that it was not an expected flight.

Q. I didn't ask you if it was your understanding.

I said, the choice of the words, unexpected flight to Chicago, those
were your words, correct?

A. From my understanding, yes.

Q. And you, of course, would have never put in any affidavit, under
penalty of perjury, an unexpected flight, unless you truthfully
believed it, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. And so you had learned from Kato Kaelin and/or Arnelle Simpson,
that Mr. Simpson had taken a flight to Chicago. And one or both of
them told you it was unexpected, true?

A. What you're asking me is, Arnelle Simpson told me that she, or
indicated that she thought her father was at the residence, when I
asked her where he was at.

Q. Maybe you didn't understand the question.

A. I understood it perfectly, sir.

Q. Then answer it.

A. I'm trying to, as best I can.

Q. Did you -- were you told then by Kato Kaelin, that the flight to
Chicago was unexpected? Yes or no?

A. No, I was not.

Q. In fact, you were told by Kato that he had gone to Chicago because
he was doing a trip for Hertz; isn't that true?

A. That's a possibility, yes.

Q. Okay.

MR. P. BAKER: 19616, line 18.

MR. KELLY: Judge, I'd object to this. It's not inconsistent at all
with his testimony just now.

MR. BAKER: I think it is.

THE COURT: It's not inconsistent, but since the jury's seen it, we'll
leave it as such.

MR. KELLY: Okay.

MR. BAKER: (Reading:)

"Q. At that time, were you

aware of where O.J. Simpson was? Yes or

no. "A. I may have been. I'm not

sure. "Q. Did you ask Kato, where's

O.J.? "A. Yes, I did. "Q. And did he tell you he

had gone on a trip to Chicago for Hertz? "A. Yes, he did."

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, that's what you knew when you wrote it was an
unexpected flight, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And you knew that Mr. Simpson had gone on an expected flight for
Hertz, correct?

A. No, I did not.

Q. So it was your choice to put the word "unexpected," when neither
Kato Kaelin, or Arnelle, or anybody else told you it was unexpected;
is that true?

A. That was -- that was a choice of words I made from the
understanding I had, that he had left and not notified anybody that he
was leaving.

Q. I see.

So it was your view that it was unexpected because, in your -- You,
first, had never heard Kato ask if O.J.'s flight had gone down, true?

A. That's true.

Q. And you had never asked him, Kato Kaelin, in your interview with
him, whether or not the flight was expected or unexpected, because he
was going on a trip for Hertz?

A. I never asked him that, no.

Q. And of course, if he's going on a trip and he's doing it at the
request of somebody, it would be your view that that's probably
unplanned and unexpected, right?

A. I don't know what the trip consisted of.

It was my understanding he left and didn't tell anyone where he was
going, because of the responses I got from his daughter, who thought
he was at the residence.

Q. Well, you talked to Kato about it and you interviewed Kato about
it; isn't that correct?

A. I -- I asked him where -- where Mr. Simpson was.

Q. You wanted to put "unexpected flight" in your search warrant so
you'd be sure and get a search warrant issued; isn't that true?

MR. KELLY: Objection. Irrelevant, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You put nothing --

THE COURT: Excuse me. The Court is only allowing this testimony
because counsel wanted to examine with regards to whether he made an
untruthful statement.

With regards to the intent or purpose of the search warrant, I've
already ruled on that. That's not before the jury.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) In -- In terms, sir, of the declaration that you
prepared at about 7:30, after you'd been at the Rockingham home, did
you include in there that O.J. Simpson had been communicated with in
Chicago, and voluntarily agreed to return?

A. No.

MR. KELLY: Objection the document, if it were at issue, it would speak
for itself. It's not at issue and is irrelevant.

THE COURT: Overruled. The answer remains.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, before you ever went to the West Los Angeles
Police Department to prepare the search warrant, you had Mr. Simpson's
daughter call Kathy Randa, didn't you?

A. No, I didn't.

Q. Arnelle Simpson had called Mr. Simpson's personal assistant to find
the exact hotel Mr. Simpson was staying at; and you were aware of
that, correct?

A. I found that out later, yes.

Q. You were all -- those three detectives -- you were all in the house
within 10, 15 feet of each other when Mr. Simpson was reached on the
telephone at the particular hotel he was staying in in Chicago, were
you not, sir?

A. I was not with Arnelle Simpson when they were making the phone
calls.

Q. Is it your testimony, sir, as lead detective, that you have no
idea, and didn't have any idea when you left the Simpson residence at
7:30 on June 13, 1994, that there had been a communication to Mr.
Simpson's assistant?

They had determined where he was in Chicago on a preplanned trip, and
gotten the exact hotel and room he was in? You have -- you no
knowledge of any of that?

MR. KELLY: Objection. Calls for hearsay, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. I was informed by Detective Lange that he had been located, and
that he had talked to him. And that was what I was told.

Q. And were you informed by any of the detectives that this was a
planned, expected trip?

A. No, sir.

Q. Cause you would put that in there; you wouldn't lie to any
magistrate, trying to get any search warrant, would you?

A. I would not lie, period.

Q. And when you put in your search warrant that the blood on the door
-- strike that.

The mark on the door of the Bronco appeared to be human blood, later
confirmed by the Scientific Investigation Division that it was human
blood, that was just an error, correct?

A. That was -- that was an error. But it was based on my experience
and the location of the blood. And I believed it to be human blood.

Q. Well --

A. I wrote it wrong. I should have said it appeared to be human blood.

Q. Well, let's examine this statement that you -- that you put in your
search warrant, sir.

"Detectives observed what appeared to be human blood." You can put a
period.

MR. KELLY: I'm going to object to this. This is not inconsistent with
the testimony.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You could put a period right there, couldn't you?

A. I certainly could have.

Q. But you put later confirmed by Scientific Investigation personnel
to be human blood on the driver's door handle of the vehicle.

And that was a lie; isn't that true, sir?

A. That was not a lie; it was a misstatement

I was told that it had been tested, and tested positive for blood. And
I just -- that was a mistake on my part.

Q. By 7:30 in the morning, the SID people had been there for a total
of 20 minutes, and you, a detective of 23 years, knew that they could
not do a positive identification for human blood in 20 minutes at the
scene. True?

A. I wish I was a perfect human being. I made a mistake.

Q. Can you answer my question, Detective Vannatter?

You knew at 7:30, when you left the scene to go help prepare the
search warrant, that SID had been there, and in the form of Mr. Fung
and Ms. Mazzola, for a total of about 20 minutes; and that they could
not do any examination at the scene to determine that it was, in fact,
human blood, correct?

A. The same answer. I made a mistake. I wish I was a perfect human
being. I'm not. I made a mistake.

Q. You lied to the magistrate to get the search warrant issued, true?

A. No, that's not true. That's nonsense.

Q. Yeah.

Now, let's go -- it is, in fact, is it not, sir, true that, in
virtually every homicide, LAPD issues a press release?

MR. KELLY: Objection as to what LAPD does with every homicide.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Did you give information to anyone at the police
department concerning the investigation of the double homicide of
Nicole Brown Simpson and an unidentified victim, at any time on June
13, 1994?

A. Did I give it -- I spoke with my supervisors, of course.

Q. And the reason, of course, that you went to Rockingham, had nothing
to do with a follow-up investigation of the murder scene at 875 South
Bundy, right?

It had to do with notification, taking care of the kids, and that sort
of thing, true?

A. Exactly.

MR. KELLY: Are you using this?

MR. BAKER: Yes, I am.

(Referring to document handed to Mr. Kelly.)

MR. KELLY: Your Honor I'm going to object to what they proposed
putting on the Elmo right now. There's certainly no foundation and
there's no reason to put it up there, based on his testimony.

THE COURT: Okay. Approach the bench.

(The following proceedings were held at the bench, with the reporter.)

MR. KELLY: Judge, it's apparently some sort of press release from the
LAPD.

First of all, Detective Vannatter has indicated he hasn't spoken to
anybody or, as far as he knows, released any information regarding the
events of June 13 that were used for any sort of press release.

He's never been shown this before. It's obviously not attributed to
him. There is no basis to indicate that it was attributed to him.

Furthermore, it's not inconsistent with any of his testimony. He said
he learned that Simpson had flown to Chicago, but it's also hearsay,
too. Had flown to Chicago.

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, this is a document that was created by the
police department, the Los Angeles Police Department. I will represent
to the Court that we will have a witness who will testify that the
LAPD squelched this particular press release; that this information
came from him -- that is, from Vannatter, that the big issue was why
no press release. There was another press release that was issued. The
reason this press release wasn't issued is because they had a
follow-up investigation of detectives that went to Mr. Simpson's
residence.

He has testified it wasn't a follow-up investigation. And I think it's
very relevant to his testimony, and that it can always be stricken
later.

THE COURT: I'll sustain the objection.

You can impeach him by your other witness. If the witness is going to
come forward and testify as to what you said, that's admissible. But
this isn't admissible. (Indicating to document.)

(The following proceedings were held in open court, in the presence of
the jury.)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, what time on the morning of the 13th did the
search warrant issue?

A. I think --

MR. KELLY: Objection. Relevance, Your Honor, with regard to the search
warrant.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Well, sometime, Detective Vannatter, you went back
to Rockingham, did you not?

A. Yes.

Q. What time was that?

A. Approximately noon.

Q. And you had been at -- after you -- well, strike that.

Let's just go through it.

You were at Bundy from 4:00 -- a little after 4, around 5 o'clock,
correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And then you were at Rockingham from 5 o'clock until approximately
7:30, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And you left Rockingham at 7:30, with the criminalists still there,
true?

A. Yes.

Q. So you didn't direct what they picked up, what they didn't pick up,
what was evidence, what was not evidence, correct?

A. No, that's not correct.

Q. Well, had you been upstairs by 7:30 and viewed any portion of the
upstairs of Mr. Simpson's property by 7:30 in the morning?

A. No.

Q. It's your testimony that, although you'd been there for
approximately two and a half hours, and you'd been inside the
residence for at least an hour and 45 minutes, you never looked
upstairs at all, correct?

A. I did not.

Q. And it's your testimony that no other police officer ever went
upstairs, correct, that you know of?

MR. KELLY: Time frame, judge.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Till 7:30 in the morning, when he -- when you left?

A. Not to my knowledge, no one was up there.

Q. Okay.

And this is in the face of what could have been an extreme emergency
situation. It's your testimony, you have no knowledge of any police
officer going to the second level of Mr. Simpson's home, true?

MR. KELLY: Objection. Asked and answered.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. Once it was determined everything appeared to be okay, there was no
reason for anybody to go up there.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) So, the answer to my question is no, nobody went up
there?

A. No.

Q. And you determined -- well, strike that.

So after you left at 7:30, you went back to Bundy to tell your partner
that you were going to get a search warrant, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And how long did you remain at Bundy at this time?

A. A couple of minutes.

Q. Now, did you have any radio communication with your partner at any
time on the 13th?

A. No, I didn't. The only radios we had were in vehicles, and that
would have been the only way we could talk, is if we were both in our
vehicle.

Q. And you hadn't gotten any telephone numbers over at Bundy?

A. No. I didn't talk to him on the telephone.

Q. Those telephones had been repeatedly used by the LAPD that is, the
telephones inside Bundy, before the Bundy scene was ever released as a
crime scene; you'd agree with that?

MR. KELLY: Objection. Assumes facts not in evidence, no foundation,
Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. I've heard that, but I never saw that happen.

Q. Now, how long did you stay at Bundy before you went to the West
L.A. station?

A. I was only there a couple of minutes.

Q. And then you went to West LA and went back to Bundy, right?

A. Yes.

Q. After the search warrant issued, you were back at Bundy, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Why?

A. To stop by and check with my partner, and to let him now what was
happening.

Q. I see.

And did you -- did you walk through the crime scene at that point in
time?

A. I walked up to where he was at, yes.

Q. Well, you walked right up the sidewalk, and walked right in the
area where the bodies had been removed before the crime scene had --
had been released, didn't you?

A. There was no other way to get there. I couldn't levitate over the
crime scene. I needed to speak to my partner.

Q. Let's talk about whether you could levitate, Detective Phillips
(sic).

Do you think you had to walk on the tile?

MR. KELLY: Vannatter.

MR. PETROCELLI: You called him Phillips.

MR. BAKER: I'm sorry. I wouldn't do that to Phillips.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Did you think you had to --

MR. PETROCELLI: Move to strike the comment. It's inappropriate.

THE COURT: Let's get on with it.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Did you think you had to walk on the tiles to get to
where your partner was?

A. I walked on the tiles to get to where my partner was, yes.

Q. You walked on the tiles and walked right in the area where the
bodies and the blood was, did you not, sir?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. And you walked right on the blanket that had been placed on one of
the victims that could have evidence on it, did you not?

A. That's a possibility, yes.

Q. You want to see it?

A. Oh, I believe you.

Q. Let's play it.

MR. P. BAKER: Exhibit 892.

(The instrument herein referred to as a Videotape of Mr. Vannatter and
others at the crime scene located at 875 South Bundy was marked for
identification as Defendants' Exhibit No. 892.)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) That's you right there, is it not, sir?

A. Yes; it is the back of my head.

Yes.

Q. You walked right up the sidewalk where the blood was, did you not,
sir?

A. Yes.

Q. You walked right on the blanket that had been on the body of Nicole
Brown Simpson, did you not, sir?

A. Yes.

Q. And then walked right up the steps, where there was blood, true?

A. True.

Q. And that crime scene had not been released, and was not released
for at least three and a half hours after that, correct?

A. I don't know what time it was released.

Q. Now then, you went back to Rockingham after you had walked through
the crime scene at Bundy, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. By the way, do you think that was good practice, Detective
Vannatter?

MR. KELLY: Objection.

THE COURT: Sustained as to good practice.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You certainly could have walked up the side of the
walkway, could you not, like you came up the first time you were there
at 4 o'clock in the morning?

A. Yeah, I certainly could.

Q. Yeah. Didn't think that was necessary?

MR. KELLY: Objection. Argumentative.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Didn't think that was necessary, did you, sir?

A. I don't -- I don't know what I was thinking. I walked in there,
according to the videotape.

Q. Now, after you left the Bundy crime scene, you went back to
Rockingham and you thought that a serious, most probable suspect was
O.J. Simpson, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And you had full license to search every portion of his -- the
interior of his house, did you not?

A. Yes.

Q. And I take it at that point, you went upstairs, true?

A. No.

Q. I take it that since you were aware that there was a bloody crime
scene, that there were shoe prints at the crime scene, there were
blood drops at the crime scene at Bundy, you wanted to do a thorough
search of Mr. Simpson's house and any articles of clothing that he
had, so you could make a determination as to whether or not he was, in
fact, the perpetrator, or had anything to do with those crimes. True?

A. True.

Q. And you went into his -- his house, and you --

By the way, you had a videographer that afternoon, did you not?

A. I didn't.

Q. Did you ever call a videographer to that location?

A. No, sir, I didn't.

Q. Did you ever tell Detective Luper to move a glove out of Mr.
Simpson's closet, and put it down in the living room, where it could
be photographed by the videographer?

A. No, sir I --

Q. You sure of that?

A. Well, I -- I know -- I don't know -- I don't think I did that.

Q. Are you telling this jury that you didn't go and look in Mr.
Simpson's closet in his bathroom, in the area of his bedroom, for
bloody clothes; is that what you are telling me?

A. Me personally?

Q. Yes, sir.

A. The first time I got to the upstairs of his house was after 5
o'clock that evening.

Q. So you came back armed with a search warrant and never went
upstairs; that's your testimony, correct?

A. That's exactly true.

Q. All right.

And you waited there, and knowing that Mr. Simpson was coming to the
residence, did you not?

A. No, that's not true.

Q. Is it your testimony that you didn't know that Mr. Simpson was
coming back from Chicago and was coming directly to 360 North
Rockingham?

A. I didn't know that.

What I knew was, we had attempted to locate him at the Los Angeles
International Airport. I was told that he had been missed.

And when I got back to the location, I went into the kitchen area of
the house and met with Detective Luper to organize the search, to do a
grid-type search of the house.

And while in there, I saw Mr. Simpson in the front yard of the house.
That's why I never had a chance to get to the upstairs.

Q. And was it -- did you request Mr. Simpson to be handcuffed by
Officer Thompson?

A. I did not.

Q. Why -- Did you think it was necessary that he be handcuffed on his
property --

MR. KELLY: Objection.

Q. -- at noon, June 13, 1994, at 12:30?

MR. KELLY: Objection. Argument, though he already testified he did not
instruct Mr. Simpson --

THE COURT: That wasn't the question. Overruled.

THE WITNESS: Did I think it was necessary that he be handcuffed?

Q. Yes, sir.

A. I took the handcuffs off. I didn't think it was necessary he had to
be handcuffed.

Q. Actually, Howard Weitzman asked you to have him removed from the
handcuffs, didn't he?

A. Asked me if I thought it was necessary, and I said no. And I took
them off.

Q. And then you had a conversation with Mr. Simpson, did you not?

A. Just a brief conversation, yes.

Q. And you requested that he go down to Parker Center with you, true?

A. True.

Q. And at the time that you requested him to go to Parker Center, he
had -- Mr. Weitzman and Mr. Taft were there, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And was it your decision make -- was it your decision that he
didn't ride with his attorneys; he had to ride with you?

A. I asked him if he would go with me, and he said yes.

Q. Was it your decision that he ride with you, as contrasted to
letting him ride with his attorneys?

A. I asked Mr. Simpson if he would accompany me to Parker Center.

He said yes, so I took him with me.

Q. You put him in the back seat with another detective, did you not?

A. I did.

Q. And you had a conversation with him on the way down to Parker
Center, didn't you?

A. Other than to ask him how he was doing and if he was all right, and
to explain what we were doing, no.

Q. Did you have any conversation of any substance whatsoever with O.J.
Simpson before you turned on the tape recorder in Parker Center and
recorded his statement?

A. I did not.

Q. You didn't have any conversation about, for example, where he had
been the night before?

A. I did not.

Q. Have no conversation with him about whether he had gone out to get
a burger?

A. I did not.

Q. And Lange was not in the car with you, was he?

A. He was not.

Q. And the only two detectives that were in the room when you took a
recorded statement from O.J. Simpson was you and Lange. True?

A. True.

Q. Now, when you took -- strike that.

Mr. Simpson volunteered to go to Parker Center with you, did he not?

A. Yes, he did.

Q. Mr. Simpson volunteered to get in an airplane and fly back from
Chicago to Los Angeles immediately when he was told of his ex-wife's
murder?

A. You're asking me something I have no knowledge of.

Q. You never talked to Detective Phillips to determine whether or not
Mr. Simpson had volunteered to get to LA as quick as possible?

MR. KELLY: Objection. Calls for hearsay.

MR. BAKER: No. I asked if he had a conversation.

THE COURT: You may answer yes or no.

A. No.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, I forgot something.

By the way, when you were walking through the Bundy crime scene there,
and going up the walkway, and on the blanket and up the steps, you
didn't wear any protective booties, did you?

A. No.

Q. In fact, you've never worn any booties at any crime scene you've
ever been at?

A. No.

Q. You certainly didn't do it that day, right?

A. No.

Q. Now, at the -- at Parker Center, you asked to take a statement from
Simpson, did you not?

A. I asked to take a statement. I asked his attorneys if I could
interview him, yes.

Q. And they indicated to you that was fine, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And you asked O.J. if you could do it, true?

A. I explained the circumstances, and he agreed to talk with us.

Q. Now, you, as a detective of 23 years and a police officer of 26 and
a half, you felt that if Mr. Simpson's attorneys were not in the room,
you would have more freedom to interrogate him, would -- did you not?

MR. KELLY: Objection. Irrelevant, Your Honor.

THE COURT: As to relevance, overruled.

MR. KELLY: Argumentative.

MR. BAKER: You're own two --

MR. KELLY: We didn't get a ruling.

MR. BAKER: It's not argumentative.

THE COURT: He may answer.

A. I would -- I would always like to interview someone without their
attorney.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) And you told O.J. that you wanted to, you know, you
had some things that you wanted to find out about, and you had -- you
wanted to discuss with him, and -- and he should give you a statement,
correct?

A. I -- I told him that we were going to talk to him about the murder
of his ex-wife, yes.

Q. Did you tell him, Detective Vannatter, that he was the only suspect
you had, before you asked him to take the tape-recording?

A. No, I did not.

Q. Did you tell him that he was the principal suspect, and you felt
that he was responsible for the murders, before you turned on the tape
recorder?

A. No.

Q. And did you tell him that he would be best served by having an
attorney in the room, before you turned on the tape recorder?

A. I read him his constitutional rights. That includes that he had the
right to have an attorney present.

Q. In fact, you read it to him. And he said, well wait a minute, and
you turned off the machine before you flipped it back on, did you not?

A. That's not true, no.

Q. So as far as -- it's your testimony in this courtroom, under
penalty of perjury, that there is no other tape anywhere that exists
between you and Mr. Simpson relative to his statement, correct?

A. Another tape?

Q. Yes, sir.

A. Between me and Mr. Simpson?

Q. Yes, sir.

A. No, there's no other tape.

Q. So you turned the tape-recording on. And you were aware, certainly,
at that time, that is -- it's now what, 1 o'clock in the afternoon,
1:30, I believe?

A. Yeah. I think it was about 1:30.

Q. And you are aware, at that time, about the fact that the murders
were committed with a knife, correct?

A. You know, actually, it looked like blunt-force trauma to me. I
looked at the crime scene. I never inspected the bodies up close until
the autopsy.

Q. Is it your testimony that you never had a conversation with
Detective Lange, who documented 875 South Bundy, and took the
measurements, and looked closely at the body, that the cause of death
was penetration by a sharp object, as contrasted to blunt-force
trauma?

A. No. He told me there were sharp-instrument wounds.

Q. Blunt-force trauma is when somebody is hit with a blunt object,
like, for example, a shovel or a hammer or something like that,
correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And -- And that crime scene is totally different in terms of how
the victims looked than a crime scene where a person has been murdered
with a sharp object such as a knife. You would agree with that?

A. Yeah, they could or -- or they could have similar type injuries.

Like I said, I never inspected the bodies closely, but I was told that
they had had sharp-instrument injuries.

Q. So my question -- to go back to my original question is that,
before you turned on the tape recorder, you knew there were two
victims, correct?

A. Oh, yes.

Q. You knew that they were victims of murder from a knife or knives,
correct?

A. Sharp instrument, yes.

I didn't know it was a knife.

Q. You knew that more probably than not, both victims had bled to
death, correct?

A. Well, I knew that they had what -- what appeared to be fatal wounds
from sharp -- or from injuries, yes.

Q. Is this a good place, Your Honor?

THE COURT: Okay. Ten-minute recess, ladies and gentlemen.

(Recess.)

(The jurors resumed their respective seats.)

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, may we approach just on a -- schedule matters
for a moment.

(A bench conference was held which was not reported.)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) All right, sir. Let me ask you a couple questions
before we play the tape of the interview.

Now, obviously, you knew when you saw Mr. Simpson at approximately
12:30, in his yard, that he had come back from Chicago, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And did you at that time request all of Mr. Simpson's luggage?

A. No, I didn't.

Q. In fact, you didn't request one piece of luggage, did you?

A. I was given a piece of luggage.

Q. Mr. Simpson walked through the gate with a bag that we have called
the grip in this case, and what was called the grip in the criminal
case. You know the bag I'm speaking of, do you not?

A. Yes, sir; the travel bag.

Q. And he also had other luggage, a golf bag and a Louis Vuitton bag
that not you, nor one LAPD officer would let in Mr. Simpson's
compound, isn't that true?

A. I was not aware it was there. I'm sure it didn't come in if I've
never seen it.

Q. Well, you don't think when you saw Mr. Simpson standing there with
that little duffel bag, that's what he went to Chicago with, did you?

MR. KELLY: Objection. Argumentative. Calls for speculation on this
witness' behavior.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. You never asked for any of Mr. Simpson's luggage at any time during
your being lead Detective in the Simpson case, did you, sir?

A. No.

Q. In fact, the only time that the golf bag and the Louis Vuitton bag
was ever brought downtown was during the criminal trial; and Mr.
Simpson had his lawyers bring it in. Isn't that correct?

A. I believe it's correct, yes.

Q. In terms of Mr. Fuhrman was he back when you were there at noon?

MR. KELLY: Objection as to the form. Where?

MR. BAKER: I apologize. Poor question.

Was Mark Fuhrman back at Rockingham when you returned there around
noon on June 13, 1994?

A. I believe he was there. I saw his partner, Brad Roberts, there,
yes.

Q. The last thing you had directed Mark Fuhrman to do was to go over
and compare the glove that he says he found at Rockingham with the
glove at 875 South Bundy, correct?

A. The last thing.

Q. Yeah. That's the last communication --

A. No.

Q. -- you had with him before noon on June 13, 1994, correct?

A. No.

Q. I strike it.

You did talk to him about whether or not he felt the glove was the
same, did you not?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, you never requested Mark Fuhrman to leave Bundy and go back to
Rockingham, did you?

A. I think that was probably implied because I asked him to go compare
the gloves and have it photographed, the one at Bundy, and let me know
on it, yes.

Q. Well, maybe my question was unclear to you.

You never requested him to go back to Rockingham, correct?

A. I asked him to let me know if the gloves appeared to be a match,
yes.

Q. And so Fuhrman goes from Rocking -- after he'd already been at
Bundy, he goes to Rockingham, makes the discovery of the mark on the
door of the Bronco, makes the discovery of a glove over on the south
side of Mr. Simpson's house, goes back to Bundy and then back to
Rockingham, right?

A. Yes.

Q. All right.

And at any time during the time that you saw Mark Fuhrman, was he
wearing a coat?

A. I don't recall him wearing a coat. He may have at some point, but I
don't recall him wearing one.

Q. Not at Rockingham, not at Bundy, correct?

A. Right. He could have been, sir, I don't recall him wearing one.

Q. You have no recollection one way or the other, correct?

A. No, sir.

Q. Now, in terms of the statement, sir, when that statement was --
tape recording was begun, it was, according to the statement itself,
13:35, which is 1:35 in the afternoon, right?

A. Yes.

Q. And now, you had been with Mr. -- Mr. Simpson in his yard at
Rockingham, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And you hadn't told him anything that you knew about the murders,
had you?

A. No.

Q. You had been with him in the automobile going down to Parker
Center, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And again, you had told him absolutely nothing that you knew about
what was going on with the murders, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And he had asked you, hadn't he?

A. No, he didn't ask me anything about it.

Q. You went on television, on a couple of shows, and said you thought
that O.J. Simpson's demeanor was inappropriate because he never asked
you about what had happened at the murders, right?

A. That's right.

Q. And you even said that in your deposition, isn't that true?

A. Yes.

Q. And then we played the tape for you where Mr. Simpson says, you
guys won't tell me anything about what's going on.

You recall that?

A. Yes. That was like a statement; not a question.

Q. Well, let's see if it's a statement or a question.

Mr. Simpson, at page 23, 810 (sic), in response --

MR. KELLY: One moment, Mr. Baker.

MR. BAKER: 810 (sic) is the D.A.'s number.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) (Reading:) Mr. Simpson: You guys haven't told me
anything. I have no idea what happened. When you said to my daughter
-- said something to me today that somebody else might have been
involved, I had absolutely no idea what -- what happened. I don't know
how, why or what. You guys haven't told me anything. Every time I ask
you guys, you're going to tell me in a bit.

Is it your statement that you had never been asked by Mr. Simpson
anything about the murders in Rockingham or in the car or at Parker
Center?

A. That's my statement. This was never asked.

Q. And when he says, every time I ask you guys, you say you're going
to tell me in a bit, you don't say anything to the effect that you've
never asked us at all, do you?

A. I didn't say that. Did I? Don't guess. Do you have a copy of that
so I can refresh my memory?

Q. Sure, be happy to show it to you.

Why don't you read to the jury what you said, sir.

MR. P. BAKER: Exhibit 783.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) In response to Mr. Simpson requesting, every time I
ask you guys, you say you're going to tell me in a bit. Tell the jury
what you responded to?

A. Well, one of us responded, I don't know whether it was myself or
Lange, one of us responded, well, we don't -- we don't know a lot of
the answers to the questions ourself yet, O.J.

Q. And I'd like to play the tape for you now, Detective Vannatter, and
I'd like you to concentrate on the tape and tell me if that was you
who said those words?

MR. PETROCELLI: Excuse me. You're playing this portion of the tape?

MR. BAKER: The whole thing.

MR. PETROCELLI: Your Honor, may I be heard, briefly.

(The following proceedings were held at the bench with the reporter:)

MR. PETROCELLI: Under what legal theory is he entitled to play the
tape? Self-serving, hearsay as to his client and what's the relevance
of the -- playing the whole tape? It's an admission to what I
introduced it against the parties.

THE COURT: Excuse me?

MR. PETROCELLI: It's an admission when we introduce his statement of
the party. How can he put on a conversation of his client? That's
inadmissible hearsay, Your Honor.

MR. BAKER: It is not inadmissible. They've cherry picked this
document, and it's the completion doctrine, we're entitled once they
open the door.

THE COURT: Excuse me?

MR. BAKER: Once they open the door --

THE COURT: Wait. Let me ask him.

(Indicating to Mr. Petrocelli.)

THE COURT: Did the plaintiff offer a portion of this?

MR. PETROCELLI: Yes, Your Honor.

MR. BAKER: Then overruled.

MR. PETROCELLI: Is that the theory, completion doctrine?

THE COURT: (Nods.)

(The following proceedings were held in open court in the presence of
the jury.)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) By the time you took this interview, you knew that
Mr. Simpson had taken a redeye on Sunday night back to Chicago,
correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And you knew that Mr. Simpson then had been awoken after a couple
hours sleep and had caught another flight directly back to Los
Angeles, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And you knew he was tired when you took that interview, did you
not?

A. Yeah.

I knew I was, too.

Q. So you were both tired, right?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

MR. P. BAKER: Exhibit 782.

MR. BAKER: We don't need this reported because there's a transcript of
it.

THE COURT: Thank you.

MR. BAKER: With plaintiffs' permission.

MR. PETROCELLI: Yes.

(Tape is played but not reported.)

(Tape concludes playing at 3:44 p.m.)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Mr. Vannatter, you were the person that questioned
Mr. Simpson when he indicated, you guys haven't told me anything,
every time I ask you guys, you're going to tell me in a bit, that was
you doing the questioning, correct?

A. It was me that answered it, yes.

Q. It was you that not only answered it, it was you doing the
questioning, was it not?

A. Yeah, I asked him what he thought had happened.

Q. And then you say, we don't know a lot of answers to those questions
ourselves yet, O.J., correct?

A. That's right.

Q. And when you said you've never asked us one thing about what
happened in those murders, you've never said anything to that effect?

MR. KELLY: Objection, argumentative.

THE COURT: Argumentative. We heard the tape. I think I'll sustain the
objection.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, Mr. Simpson, during the interview, indicated to
you that you -- that he had some guns and that you could go take all
of them, did he not?

A. Yes.

Q. He volunteered to take a blood test when you said there was blood
all over the place, did he not?

A. Yes.

Q. And he didn't ask to see an attorney or anything, did he?

MR. KELLY: Objection. At what time? He got --

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) When you're talking about blood all over the place,
he said, I'll take a blood test, take my blood, words to that effect?

MR. KELLY: Objection.

A. We were talking about blood only at the Rockingham location. We
never told him about blood at the Bundy location.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) All he indicated to you when you were talking about
blood, was take my blood test, correct?

A. Yes. In fact, he said the blood at his location -- at the
Rockingham location was probably his.

Q. Now, you had apparently brought up a polygraph test to Mr. Simpson
previous, did you not, that is, previous to starting the tape recorder
at 13:35 on the afternoon of June 13, 1994, true?

A. Me?

Q. Yes.

A. No.

Q. When you said, quote, "Did Mr. Weitzman, your lawyer, your
attorney, talk to you, anything about this polygraph we brought up
before," were you talking about you brought up a polygraph to Mr.
Weitzman, not Mr. Simpson?

A. I didn't say that. That was Detective Lange's words.

Q. You were still there; you hadn't left the room yet?

A. I was still there, yes.

Q. And Detective Lange was not at Rockingham, was he?

A. No.

Q. Detective Lange was not in the vehicle when you came from
Rockingham to Parker Center, was he?

A. No.

Q. And my question, then, again to you is, did in fact you bring up a
polygraph to Mr. Weitzman in front of Mr. Simpson?

A. No.

Q. And did you want Mr. Simpson to take a polygraph test?

A. I would have liked for him to, sure.

Q. In fact, Mr. Simpson made an offer in writing to you to take a
polygraph test, did he not?

MR. PETROCELLI: Your Honor, I'm going to at this point lodge an
objection for the record in view of his prior position, and your
instruction, and serve notice that I intend to follow up on this if
this question is answered.

THE COURT: Well, I'll serve notice on you that you may follow up
within the parameters of my ruling, and the limitations of the rules
of evidence will apply.

MR. KELLY: Can I see what that is before you throw it up there?

MR. BAKER: Sure.

(Mr. Kelly reviews document.)

MR. KELLY: Okay. I'd object to this going up there, Mr. Baker.

MR. BAKER: You want to give us a ground?

MR. KELLY: It's hearsay, it's self-serving, not relevant, no
foundation.

THE COURT: Self-serving. Sustained.

MR. BAKER: You haven't even seen the document, Your Honor.

MR. PETROCELLI: Would you like --

THE COURT: You told me what it was.

MR. PETROCELLI: I would object to it.

THE COURT: Approach the bench.

MR. BAKER: It's been overruled before, you've seen it.

THE COURT: You indicated it's a written request for polygraph. It's
self-serving. That was the objection and it's sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Did you receive a written offer to have Michael
Baden and Henry Lee assist you in the investigation, Detective
Vannatter?

A. Yes.

MR. KELLY: Same objection, self-serving document.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, you -- after you took the statement from Mr.
Simpson, he didn't restrict in any way, shape or form the numbers of
questions you could ask, correct?

A. No.

Q. And you asked all the questions you and your partner thought were
necessary, true?

A. No. I don't think that's true.

Q. You had no parameters put on you in terms -- by the attorneys
representing Mr. Simpson, did you?

A. No, no, but I realized that if I --

MR. BAKER: I move to strike everything after "No," Your Honor, as
nonresponsive.

THE COURT: Stricken.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, so -- and there was nothing that was forbidden
to you during that interview or Detective Lange to investigate Mr.
Simpson?

MR. KELLY: Objection, asked and answered several times, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. No.

Q. And you were in a room in Parker Center, at the LA Police
Department, downtown Los Angeles, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And it was a room where no one else is present, true?

A. Yes.

Q. Just you, Lange and O.J. Simpson, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, after that, you took Mr. Simpson and you had a police nurse,
Thano Peratis, take blood, did you not?

A. After the interview?

Q. Yes.

A. No, after the interview we took him to the photography lab and had
his hand photographed.

Q. Okay.

Now, this was your prime suspect in this high-publicity case, that is,
O.J. Simpson, and you had him in Parker Center, and you had him
without any attorneys or anyone else around, and you took him to get
his hand photographed, right?

A. Yes.

Q. And I take it, sir, that between you and Detective Lange, there was
close to 50 years detective -- certainly at least 40 years of
detective service at LAPD on that day, true?

A. Yes.

Q. And you were looking for anything that you felt would tie Mr.
Simpson to the murders, correct?

A. We were looking for evidence, yes.

Q. 'Cause he was the primary and only suspect you had, right?

A. At that point, there could have been other suspects. I didn't know
exactly what had happened at that point.

Q. Well, you didn't look for -- for any suspects, did you?

A. There was an extensive investigation done.

Q. So you had Mr. Simpson, this primary suspect, and you had him in
Parker Center and you took him to get photographed, did you not?

A. Yes, his hand.

Q. And you looked at both his left hand and his right hand, did you
not?

A. I did not personally examine him. I saw him from a distance.

Q. Are you telling these ladies and gentlemen of this jury that you,
as a detective of 23 years, thinking you had a prime suspect that had
a cut on his hand, didn't pick up his hand, turn it over and look for
every cut on his hand? You didn't do that?

A. I didn't do that. I saw the cuts on his knuckle and I had him
photographed.

Q. And are you telling these ladies and gentlemen of the jury that you
never looked at his right hand to see if there were any cuts on his
right hand?

A. I didn't see any cuts on his right hand.

Q. It's true -- you picked up his hands, you inspected the up -- the
palmar surface, the dorsal surface on both hands to see if there were
any cuts other than the cut over his knuckle on his left middle
finger, true?

A. No, not true.

Q. How close did you get to Mr. Simpson's hand to observe the cut or
to inspect it to see if there was more than a cut?

MR. PETROCELLI: Assumes facts not in evidence, Your Honor. He didn't
say anything about inspecting.

MR. BAKER: I'll be happy to try and lay a foundation.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) In terms of Mr. Simpson being the prime suspect and
having a cut on his hand, and you knowing that the murders had taken
place with a knife, the cut's pretty important, isn't it, sir?

A. It appeared to be a piece of evidence, yes.

Q. Well, I mean if this was a shooting, that piece of evidence would
have different significance than a killing of two individuals with a
knife or knives, true?

A. According to the circumstances of the murder. I don't know. It
would be according to what happened with the murder.

Q. Well, let's talk about what happened, that you knew, at 2:30 on the
afternoon of June 13, 1994.

You knew two people were deceased, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And you knew that they were murdered with knives or sharp objects,
correct?

A. Sharp instruments, yes.

Q. And you knew that there was a cut on Mr. Simpson's hand, correct?

A. That's why I photographed it, yes.

Q. And you knew that he was your suspect, the primary suspect and the
only suspect you had, true?

A. You keep -- no, I didn't know he was the only suspect. I knew he
was a suspect in that case, but there could have been more people
involved.

Q. You knew at the time that you -- after you took him in and
photographed the hand, that he was the only suspect that you, as lead
detective for this double homicide, was aware of, correct?

A. Aware of at that point, yes.

Q. And you also knew that there was going to be some pressure brought
to bear on the LAPD by the media, to get a suspect, and to get someone
arrested for this heinous crime of June 12, 1994, true?

A. That wouldn't have bothered me.

Q. Didn't care whether you say it bothered you or not, you knew it,
didn't you?

A. No, I didn't know that.

Q. Oh.

A. Pressure from the media really had nothing to do with investigating
a case. I mean that has nothing to do with a murder case.

Q. Absolutely nothing to do with anything that you did, right?

A. No.

Q. Oh.

A. It's -- that has nothing to do with the circumstances of the
murder.

Q. You certainly wouldn't rush to judgments in a high publicity case?

A. I wouldn't rush to judgment in any case.

Q. You'd want to do a thorough and complete investigation, right?

A. As best I could.

Q. Part of that thorough and complete investigation is when you have
the prime suspect, to inspect that prime suspect's hands once you see
that there is a cut on his hand and the murder has occurred as a
result of a sharp object penetrating two human beings, true?

A. I photographed the cuts I saw on his hands.

Q. Now, you saw when you say cuts, you saw exactly one cut, isn't that
true?

A. No, I saw two.

Q. You saw two cuts.

Did you make any notes of the two cuts, Detective Vannatter?

A. No. I had them photographed and then I had them examined by the
registered nurse in the jail dispensary.

Q. And you saw absolutely not a single cut on Mr. Simpson's fourth
finger of his left hand, did you?

MR. PETROCELLI: No foundation that he looked, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. I don't recall seeing it, no.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Well, it's certainly something you look for with any
cut that you could find on Mr. Simpson's hands, isn't that true?

A. I didn't -- I don't recall seeing a cut on his fourth finger.

Q. I understand that, sir.

In terms of the murder of two human beings with a sharp object, and
you have a cut and the prime subject, you certainly looked on every
finger, every digit of both hands to determine whether or not there
were any other cuts, because you wanted to be a good, thorough police
detective having 23 years experience and examined over a hundred
homicides, right?

MR. PETROCELLI: Objection, asked and answered, compound,
argumentative.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. Sir, I photographed the cuts I observed on his hand.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You can answer my question, Detective Vannatter.

And that is, you certainly would look at every digit on both the right
and left hand, on the palmar aspect, the dorsal aspect, and make sure
that there was not any other cuts because that could be crucial
evidence, true?

A. I didn't do that. I photographed the cuts I saw on his hand.

Q. Are you telling the jury you never looked to see if there was
anymore cuts than the obvious cut on the left knuckle of Mr. Simpson's
hand; is that what your telling us?

A. I'm telling you that I photographed the cuts that I observed on his
hand.

Q. I understand that, sir.

Maybe my questions are unclear.

Are you telling us you never looked except for the obvious?

A. I guess if you want to put it that way, yes.

Q. So you didn't want to do a thorough investigation, true?

MR. KELLY: Objection, argumentative, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, you then took O.J. Simpson and had blood
removed from O.J. Simpson, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And for the first time in your entire career as a detective, you
took reference blood from Parker Center, to the crime scene that is
some 15 miles away, correct?

MR. KELLY: Objection. This area was covered once before on the direct
case.

MR. BAKER: No, it wasn't.

MR. PETROCELLI: Yes, it was.

THE COURT: I think it was covered on cross-examination.

MR. PETROCELLI: It was indeed.

MR. BAKER: That was gone into only minutely due to the Court's
rulings. I request the Court's indulgence. And it will be very brief.

MR. PETROCELLI: Misstates what happened.

MR. KELLY: It was covered very clearly, this particular area.

THE COURT: I'll allow you to examine on the issue provided you stay
within your promise of being very brief.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) It was the first time you've taken blood from Parker
Center out to a crime scene, true.

MR. KELLY: Objection to the relevance of that particular question.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. This was a unique situation.

I believe this is the first time in my career I ever got a voluntary
sample from a person that wasn't in custody.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Did you rehearse that answer with Mr. Kelly?

A. Absolutely not.

Q. Is the -- Now, can you answer my question.

That's the first time you ever took a reference sample of blood to a
crime scene, true?

A. That could be, yes.

Q. And you could have got a DR number and booked the evidence in
Parker Center, true?

MR. KELLY: Objection. This was covered thoroughly the first time,
about the DR number.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. Yes, I could have done that.

Q. In fact, you told this jury the last time you were here you
couldn't have booked the evidence at Parker Center; isn't that true,
sir?

A. I couldn't have booked the evidence without obtain a DR number,
without knowing the item number, but it could have been done. It could
have taken me a long time.

I couldn't have left it without booking it. And I realized that Mr.
Fung was itemizing items of evidence, and to ensure the chain of
custody and control, I took it to him.

Q. Ensure the chain of custody and control.

MR. BAKER: Put up the map.

MR. P. BAKER: This is 891.

(The document herein described as a map of Los Angeles was marked for
identification as Defendants' Exhibit No. 891.)

(Exhibit 891 displayed on Elmo.)

MR. BAKER: Can you focus that.

(Indicating to Elmo.)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Parker Center, 150 North Los Angeles Street?

A. Yes.

Q. You can get a DR number at Parker Center, correct?

A. I would have had to obtain one in West Los Angeles.

Q. Just answer the question, Mr. Vannatter.

You can get a DR number at Parker Center, can you not?

A. May I properly answer the question?

Q. Why don't you answer mine?

A. I would have had to obtain a DR number from West Los Angeles
Division.

Q. And you could have gotten a DR number and they had facilities at
Parker Center to book that evidence, true?

A. Yes, that's true.

Q. And they had -- They had facilities to book that evidence
approximately a mile away at Piper Tech, right?

A. That's correct.

Q. And you didn't know when you retained the reference sample of Mr.
Simpson, whether or not Fung was at Rockingham, or Bundy, or someplace
else, true?

A. I knew that the search warrant hadn't been shut down at Rockingham,
and I made the assumption that he was there because they were still
doing the search.

Q. The answer to my question is true? You didn't know whether he was
at Rockingham, at Bundy, or if he had left both of the scenes, true?

A. I didn't know for sure, that's true.

Q. All right.

MR. BAKER: And back it off.

(Indicating to Elmo.)

Q. And you got back in your car and went 18.7 miles to Rockingham,
correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. You, sir, told us the last time, that you believe you got a manila
envelope out of your desk and put the vial in the manila envelope,
right?

A. Well, you corrected me last time and refreshed my memory.
Apparently, I had taken an envelope down to Mr. Peratis because he
signed it and the affidavit portion of it.

Q. You never took an envelope down to Mr. Peratis.

He gave you a signed evidence envelope at the time when the blood was
taken, true or untrue?

A. That's a possibility. I -- I know that I had a signed envelope from
him.

Q. Did you have one note about the chain of custody of this reference
vial from the time you took it at 3:30 until you were at Rockingham at
5:26?

A. No.

Q. So there is no document that records this all important chain of
custody from the time you took custody of the blood vial until the
time you arrived at Rockingham, and the only reason we know at 5:26 is
because the media taped it; isn't that true?

MR. KELLY: Objection, argumentative, compound.

THE COURT: It's compound. Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Let me put it this way then, sir, you certainly
never made a note of when you arrived at Rockingham, did you?

A. No.

MR. KELLY: Objection, asked and answered.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You never even got one slip of paper, a receipt or
anything else from Dennis Fung for this all important 8 cc's of O.J.
Simpson's reference blood, true?

MR. KELLY: Objection, assumes facts not in evidence with regard to the
8 cc's.

THE COURT: 8 cc's. Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Didn't have him sign a piece of paper, nothing,
right?

A. No.

Q. And that's your idea of preserving the chain of custody, Mr.
Vannatter?

A. Yeah, I personally hand carried it and gave it to him.

Q. And did you watch this all important piece of evidence taken to the
crime scene being placed in a trash bag?

A. No, sir, I didn't.

Q. Did you -- Was Ms. Mazzola watching this transfer of this blood
vial that contained Mr. Simpson's reference blood when you --

MR. KELLY: Objection.

Q. -- when you handed it to Mr. Fung?

MR. KELLY: Objection, calls for speculation as to what Ms. Mazzola was
doing, Your Honor.

THE COURT: As to whether she was watching, as phrased I'll sustain it.

You can rephrase it.

MR. BAKER: Thank you.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, where were you physically when the transfer of
this blood vial was made to you to -- from you to whoever it was made
to?

A. In the foyer of the house, right inside the front door area of the
residence.

Q. Who was present when this transfer was made?

A. I don't know. Other than Fung and myself, I don't know.

Q. Oh, was Ms. Mazzola present when you were handing this --

A. I just answered that I don't know.

Q. Well, you sat through a lot of the criminal trial and sat right in
the spectator section and watched it, didn't you?

MR. KELLY: Objection, argumentative and obviously asking for hearsay.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. KELLY: This witness's answer --

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) So you can't assist us at all, whether anybody else
was present at the time that you say you transferred this vial to Mr.
Fung, right?

MR. KELLY: Objection, asked and answered, Your Honor.

THE COURT: You may answer.

A. I don't know.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) So you took this gray envelope containing Mr.
Simpson's vial, and you handed it to Mr. Fung, right?

A. Yes.

Q. And did you tell him this is O.J. Simpson's reference vial, we just
took this blood at Parker Center, or words to that effect?

A. I told him it was a sample of blood from Mr. Simpson, yes.

Q. And what did you observe him do with it?

A. I don't -- I don't know what he did with it. The criminalist
controls the evidence. Once it goes to him I -- I have absolutely no
control of it anymore.

Q. Well, maybe I misunderstood. I thought when we started the
examination of you this morning, you agreed, as you previously
testified, that you were co-lead detective, you were in charge of the
fingerprint people, you were in charge of the criminalists, and you
were in charge of the coroner, did you not?

A. Once a piece of evidence is collected, it then becomes the property
of the Property Division or Scientific Investigation Division. We do
not have any more control over it.

Q. Didn't understand my question, sir?

A. I understand it very well.

Q. Then answer it.

A. That's the best answer I can give you.

Q. You were in charge of the criminalist when you handed the vial --
the envelope that you say contained the vial, to Mr. Fung, right?

MR. KELLY: Objection, argumentative and vague in terms of in charge
of.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. We're in charge of instructing them what portions of evidence we
want collected. Once that evidence is collected, we no longer have
control over those pieces of evidence.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) All right.

Now -- well, you weren't -- what time did Mr. Fung arrive at
Rockingham, since you were in charge of telling what evidence to
collect on June 13, 1994?

A. Shortly after 7 o'clock.

Q. What time did he leave?

A. I don't know. I wasn't there.

Q. Well, what time did he come back to Rockingham, do you know that?

A. I don't know that. I wasn't there.

Q. So the only thing -- when you left Rockingham to go to Parker
Center with O.J. Simpson, Fung wasn't there?

A. I don't -- I don't recall seeing him there. I don't know where he
was at that point.

Q. The only thing that you recall was he was there early in the
morning, at a little after 7, and wasn't there when you returned
around noon, correct?

A. I -- before I left there, I walked him through the evidence that
had been found, and instructed him to collect that.

Q. I didn't ask you when you walked him. I gave you certain time
parameters.

A. How else can I answer the question?

He was there when I left. I don't believe he was there -- I didn't see
him when I came back at 12 o'clock. I was there for approximately 5
minutes, and I left again, and I didn't get back there until after 5
o'clock that evening.

Q. So when you left Parker Center with this all important piece of
evidence that you were so concerned about the chain of custody, you
didn't know whether the crime scene had even been released at Bundy;
isn't that true?

A. Yes, I knew it had been released.

Q. Oh, I see.

How did you know that?

A. Because Mr. Lange had been notified of that by someone.

MR. PETROCELLI: What exhibit is this?

MR. P. BAKER: This is next in order.

THE CLERK: 2250.

MR. KELLY: What is it?

MR. PETROCELLI: What is it?

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Well, how long after you arrived was this transfer
made of this blood vial?

A. It was made immediately. When I walked inside to see Mr. Fung, I
gave it to him.

Q. So you immediately walked into the premises, found Mr. Fung in the
foyer, handed him the envelope, correct?

A. I believe he was in the kitchen area when I first walked in. And I
-- and I asked him to come over, or someone asked him to come over,
and I immediately gave him the envelope.

Q. And what did you see him do with the envelope?

A. I don't know what he did with the envelope.

Q. I didn't ask you if you knew.

I said, did you visualize him do anything with the it.

Did he turn around and walk away?

Did he walk down the foyer, past the dining room, or into the living
room?

A. Sir, I don't know what he did with the envelope.

Q. You don't have any recollection of what occurred, correct?

A. I don't know.

MR. KELLY: Objection. Asked and answered previously.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. BAKER: I'd like to play the videotape of you arriving at
Rockingham, and the time that Mr. Fung leaves Rockingham.

MR. PETROCELLI: I assume this is not edited in any way, Mr. Baker; is
that right? This tape isn't edited? You'll show the complete footage?

THE COURT: Is that an objection?

MR. PETROCELLI: Yes.

THE COURT: Thank you.

MR. BAKER: It's just like the depositions of various people, that has
-- starts, it has a time on it, and it stops and it has a time on it.
And it starts and it has the time on it when Mr. Fung leaves
Rockingham with the trash bag.

MR. PETROCELLI: I would object if it's not a continuous depiction of
him.

THE COURT: Overruled. If it's a segment and it's got time, that's
fine.

(The videotape referred to was Played in open court, "TCR 17:16:50,
stopping at 17:16:53.)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) That's you at 5:16 and 53 seconds arriving at
Rockingham, correct, sir?

A. Yes.

MR. BAKER: Go ahead, Phil.

(The videotape referred to was played in open court, starting at
17:42:54.)

MR. PETROCELLI: That's another problem, Your Honor.

MR. BAKER: This is --

MR. KELLY: Your Honor, we just went back 11 minutes.

MR. BAKER: Went back 11 minutes?

MR. MEDVENE: Forward.

MR. PETROCELLI: That was the problem I was afraid of.

THE COURT: Back it up.

MR. P. BAKER: Back it up?

THE COURT: Yeah.

MR. PETROCELLI: It's before and after, but not the during.

MR. BAKER: Maybe you can get a videotape from the street into the
foyer. No one else can.

MR. PETROCELLI: Then don't show it.

THE COURT: What's the objection?

MR. KELLY: It's edited. It skips 26, 36, 26 minutes or something like
that.

MR. PETROCELLI: It's irrelevant.

MR. KELLY: It's irrelevant, is the objection. No foundation and --

THE COURT: As I understand, the defense is offering this to show when
this witness arrived at the scene, at that time and when Mr. Fung
left.

Is that all you're offering it for?

MR. BAKER: That's all we're offering it for.

THE COURT: Okay.

MR. PETROCELLI: In that case, no objection to those.

(The videotape referred to was again played, starting at 17:42:55.)

MR. BAKER: Now, cut it, Phil.

(The videotape referred to stopped playing.)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, in the 24 minutes between the time you arrived
and the time that the trash bag is carried out, did you have any
conversations with Mr. Fung or Andrea Mazzola about the blood vial?

MR. KELLY: Calls for hearsay, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Answer yes or no.

A. No.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You never saw Mr. Fung or Mr. Mazzola -- or Ms.
Mazzola leave Rockingham after you arrived at 5:16, until they left at
5:42, correct?

A. What was the question again? I never saw them leave before --

Q. You never saw them leave the premises and go outside the gate and
put any evidence into the van between 5:16 and 5:42, correct?

A. Not to my knowledge.

Q. You don't think, you know, if that blood went directly into the
trash bag or anywhere else you've never seen him and had not one
conversation with him after you handed it to him?

A. That's correct.

Q. Now, let's talk a little bit, then -- strike that.

After that, you attended, the following day, the autopsy of the two
victims, right?

A. Yes.

Q. And after that, you went and picked up the blood of the two victims
at the coroner's, did you not?

MR. KELLY: Objection. Same objection as the prior sequence, Your
Honor. This was all thoroughly covered on cross the last time Mr.
Vannatter testified.

MR. BAKER: No, it wasn't.

I'm trying to get done.

THE COURT: You said an hour. You're already 15 minutes after your
hour. I'm just wondering whether I'm going to do a rerun -- allow to
you do a rerun, consume a little more time.

How much longer is this going to be?

MR. BAKER: My examination of him?

THE COURT: Yeah.

MR. BAKER: We'll finish it by 4:30.

THE COURT: Okay.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You picked up the blood at the coroner's office. You
hadn't done that before, either, had you?

A. No, I've picked up blood from the coroner's office before.

Q. If the coroner said he'd never given it to a detective in his
entire life, you wouldn't have any way of disagreeing with that,
correct?

MR. KELLY: Objection. Calls for hearsay.

THE COURT: Stricken.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) To your knowledge, was anyone other than yourself --
Detective Vannatter had custody of all of the victims' -- and the
suspect, at any time from June 13, 1994 to June 17, 1994, other than
yourself?

MR. KELLY: Objection.

THE COURT: That question --

MR. PETROCELLI: Vague.

MR. BAKER: Pardon?

MR. PETROCELLI: Objection.

THE COURT: I think you left out some important items in that question.

MR. BAKER: I apologize.

MR. KELLY: If he adds them, it's compound, Your Honor.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) The only -- they were persons that you're aware of
that had custody of both victims' and Mr. Simpson's blood, with nobody
else being around them, being with them, is you. True?

A. I don't know whether that's true or not. I don't know how it was
handled after I turned it over.

Q. You do know, sir, that when you take evidence, and you maintain
evidence, that you are required to book it immediately, correct?

MR. KELLY: Objection. Not relevant to this particular situation, Your
Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. You book it as soon as practical, yes.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) The manual says the word "immediately." It didn't
say that Phil Vannatter gets to use his judgment as to when "as soon
as practical" is; isn't that correct, sir?

A. Sometimes it's impossible to do it immediately; you do it as soon
as practical.

Q. And the booking of evidence on June 13, 1994, of the blood, could
have been done within ten minutes at the Parker Center, true?

MR. KELLY: Objection. Asked and answered.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) In any event, sir, I want to go into one other area.

When you took Mr. Simpson from Rockingham to Parker Center, you took
his grip, or duffel bag, or travel bag, whatever it was, with you, did
you not?

A. I placed it into the vehicle with us, yes.

Q. You had it in the front seat of your vehicle, did you not?

A. Front passenger's floorboard.

Q. And you testified in the criminal trial, that you got Mr. Simpson's
permission to look into that grip, didn't you?

MR. KELLY: Objection as to the form of the question as to what he
testified to at criminal trial, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Ask your question.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Well, you looked into his grip and you inspected the
contents thereof, did you not?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. And in the grip, when you inspected it --

and by the way, you have testified both that you had permission from
Mr. Simpson, and that you haven't had Mr. Simpson's permission to get
into that grip; isn't that true?

MR. KELLY: Objection. Argumentative.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. Well, I don't think I ever personally asked him, but I think there
was implied permission when he cooperated with us.

Q. So you think that if he says, I'll give you a statement, and I'll
give you blood, that that gives you permission to do anything in any
of his property without asking, right?

That's you your view of what the --

A. I did it, sir.

Q. -- of what the Fourth Amendment --

A. I looked in the bag.

MR. KELLY: Objection.

THE COURT: Sustain as to Fourth Amendment, counsel.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Anyway, you looked in there, right?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And you went through the contents of that grip, did you not?

A. I looked at the contents to see if there was any visible blood in
it, yes.

Q. And you saw a passport in there, didn't you?

A. I don't recall seeing a passport.

Q. You saw a disguise in there, didn't you?

A. No.

Q. You saw items in that duffel bag or grip that Mr. Simpson kept --
there was cash in there, wasn't there?

A. I don't recall seeing any cash.

Q. Well, do you have a recollection of seeing anything in there?

A. There was clothing in it.

Q. What clothing?

A. I don't know. I wasn't looking to identify each item. I was looking
to see if there was any evidence of what appeared to be blood on
anything.

Q. It's your testimony --

MR. KELLY: Well, Your Honor I'd object and ask that the witness
complete the answer to the last question before --

THE COURT: Sounds like he completed it.

Ask another question.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) So you don't remember the items of clothing. That's
all that was in there was clothing, right?

A. No, there were some other items.

Q. What else was there.

A. I can't tell you exactly, sir.

Q. Do you have a recollection of a phone being in there, a cell phone?

A. Could have been, yeah.

Q. No, I didn't ask you if there could have been. There could have
been an elephant in there.

The question was, was there a cell phone in there, to your
recollection?

No recollection, right?

A. I don't recall seeing one.

Q. Do you recall that there was a cell phone kit, battery and charger,
so that if you're away on a trip, that you've got the apparatus to
recharge your cell phone?

Do you recall that being in there?

A. I don't recall seeing that.

Q. Only things that you can recall are clothes, and you have no
recollection what they are, right?

A. That's absolutely correct.

Q. Now, let me ask you this: You had custody of that overnight, right?

A. No.

Q. Well, you certainly didn't -- didn't give it back to Mr. Simpson
when he left the LAPD, did you?

A. I returned it to Rockingham when I went to Rockingham.

Q. Maybe you didn't understand my question

You certainly didn't return it to Mr. Simpson, while he was at LAPD
and before he left; isn't that correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. And -- and you had full -- you could go in there once you decided
that you had implied permission -- I take it you thought you had
implied permission to do anything you wanted with that grip, do --
that is, test any item, do anything you want, correct?

A. I could have booked it as evidence, yes.

Q. Well, no. You'd have had to have taken it to Rockingham to do that.

MR. KELLY: Objection. Argumentative.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You want to answer that or not?

A. What I would have had to do is taken to Rockingham.

Q. You could have?

A. I took it to Rockingham, and returned it to him, Mr. Baker.

Q. You took it to Rockingham and gave to Mr. Simpson?

A. I returned it to the location, yes.

Q. And while you were there, on the afternoon of the 13th, I take it
that -- at least at that point, you went in and inspected Mr.
Simpson's closet, right?

A. Yes, I went into his closet.

Q. And looked thoroughly for bloody items, did you not?

A. That had already been done during the service of the search
warrant.

Q. Well, didn't you tell a second magistrate on June 28, 1993, that
the search was ineffective; that you hadn't done a thorough search of
Mr. Simpson's house?

Let me see any can refresh your recollection with the search warrants,
June 28.

MR. MEDVENE: Page, Bob?

MR. BAKER: I'm trying to get it. I'm trying to get it.

MR. P. BAKER: 1798.

MR. BAKER: 1798.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) And there is the search warrant that you caused to
be issued on June 28, 1994, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And you told the magistrate that -- by words or effect, that you
people just hadn't picked up enough stuff at Mr. Simpson's house
pursuant to the search warrant of June 13, 1994, right?

A. I would categorize it as saying it was a search for additional
evidence that had not been recovered to that point.

Q. Well, look at the last page, and tell us if the words about the
gloves inadvertently not being taken or something to that effect --
tell us if those are your words.

(Witness reviews documents.)

A. Yes.

Q. Now, you didn't ask to search the golf bag or the Louis Vuitton bag
on June 28, 1994, did you?

A. No.

Q. You never asked for that, did you?

A. No.

Q. Now, in terms of the search warrant of June of 19 -- June 28 of
1994, you asked to look for a knife, didn't you?

A. Yes.

Q. Didn't find a knife, did you?

A. No.

Q. Did you -- do you know -- did you go upstairs in Mr. Simpson's
bedroom?

THE COURT: When?

MR. BAKER: Pursuant to the search warrant of 6-28. I'm sorry.

A. There were people assigned to search the bedroom, yes.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) And did you go to the area where there's, right
outside of his bathroom, the dressing area?

A. There was a thorough search made of the location.

Q. Anyone ever pull open the medicine cabinets to see a stiletto with
a six-inch blade in there --

MR. KELLY: Objection.

Q. -- on subsequent searches to June 28, 1994?

MR. KELLY: No foundation. Argumentative, irrelevant.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. There was no knife there. There was a thorough search done of the
location.

Q. You sure of that?

A. I'm positive.

Q. There wouldn't have been a knife there, and no judge (sic) ever
went up there and got it after your thorough search had been
accomplished?

MR. KELLY: Objection.

MR. PETROCELLI: Lack of foundation.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, sir, relative to your participation in the
case, you have been on how many television shows subsequent to the
murder?

A. Seven or eight, probably.

Q. Denouncing my client, right?

A. Denouncing your client?

Q. Yes.

A. Well, I believe your client is guilty of murder, yes.

MR. BAKER: Move to strike as nonresponsive.

That's about as much denouncement as you can get.

MR. PETROCELLI: It was responsive.

THE COURT: Overruled, I think.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) That's about as much denouncement as you can get?

A. The evidence indicates that to me, yes.

MR. BAKER: Move to strike. Nonresponsive.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. You were just absolutely -- Strike that. How much money are you
getting for writing your book?

A. How much money am --

Q. Money, dollars.

A. Mr. Lange and I were lucky enough to get a contract with two other
people for $115,000.

Q. So you, sir -- so you're cashing in on your belief, right?

A. Well, like a lot of people are, I'm attempting to better my
lifestyle and make some money, certainly.

Q. Yeah.

So you're attempting to better your lifestyle and make some money, and
you want to cooperate with the plaintiffs in this case as much as you
can; isn't that true, sir?

A. I'm attempting to tell you the truth, as best I can recall --

Q. I see.

A. -- how things occurred.

Q. Now, let's try it again. Same question, second time.

You are attempting to cooperate as much as you can, because you hope
that your appearance on this witness stand, in this courtroom, gets
you more money for your book deal; isn't that true?

A. Boy, I would have given the book deal up not to testify from this
stand anymore. I'm not happy to be here at all.

Q. Really?

A. Yeah.

Q. You'll give it up?

A. I'm not happy to be here, believe me.

Q. You're cooperating as much as you can with the plaintiffs; isn't
that true, sir.

MR. KELLY: Objection as to the form, "as much as you can."

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You have -- you wouldn't shade your testimony in
favor of the plaintiffs in this case, and against Mr. Simpson,
regardless of your feelings; you call it right up to the middle; isn't
that true?

A. Again, I've attempted to tell you --

Q. And can you answer my question for a change, Detective Vannatter?

A. I would not shade my testimony. I've attempted to tell you the
truth, as best as I can recall, how things occurred.

Q. And what you wanted to do is, you want Mr. Simpson to be held
responsible, so your book deal is better, and so that you're
vindicated for your inactions in investigating O.J. Simpson subsequent
to June 12, 1994; isn't that true?

A. Whatever happens here is out of my control. I'm here because I have
been asked to be here, and I'm here because I promised the Judge that
I would be here the last time I was here.

I have traveled from out of state to come here. I have left my wife by
herself. And I would rather not be here; I would rather be home.

Q. Detective Vannatter, let's just ask a couple more questions, and
I'll conclude.

THE COURT: I hope so, because it's almost 430.

MR. BAKER: I understand.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You were aware when you were in Indiana, before you
appeared in this courtroom, before, that you couldn't have been
subpoenaed from Indiana to this courtroom, correct?

A. Well, I could have been subpoenaed with an out-of-state service;
sure, I could.

Q. No. You were aware that you could not, any more than Detective
Fuhrman could be; isn't that true?

MR. KELLY: Objection. Argumentative, irrelevant.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) And you voluntarily appeared to assist the
plaintiffs and to lean your testimony as far as you could for the
plaintiffs. True or untrue?

A. Untrue.

MR. BAKER: Nothing further of this witness.

THE COURT: Can I see the reporter at bench.

(The following proceedings were held at the bench, with the reporter.)

THE COURT: That document that you mentioned, offer --

MR. BAKER: What about it?

THE COURT: I want to see it.

MR. BAKER: Okay.

MR. PETROCELLI: Are you talking about --

MR. KELLY: Polygraph, yeah.

(Pause for Mr. Baker to retrieve document.)

THE COURT: Okay.

Ms. Reporter, that portion of the testimony where Mr. Baker said you
have not seen -- even seen the document, Your Honor. Mr. Petrocelli
would you like, and then you have on here the Court, I -- you told me
what it was. That's not what I said. So I want to clarify the record.

(Referring to realtime computer screen.)

MR. PETROCELLI: What I recall, Your Honor saying --

THE COURT: Well --

THE REPORTER: I can't tell -- I can't tell without looking at the
notes. It might have mistranned.

THE COURT: I want to clarify the record today. I don't want to be in a
position of coming back the day after and trying to explain why it
wasn't correct at the time that it came to my attention.

(Court reporter reviews Judge's realtime computer screen.)

THE COURT REPORTER: I can tell, Your Honor, it was -- you said, "You
told me what it was." And Mr. Petrocelli said "I would object to it."

(Referring to page 163 of daily transcript.)

THE COURT: Okay.

(Pause for the Court to review documents.)

THE COURT: Okay.

The document that Mr. Baker referred to appears to be a letter dated
June 15, 1994, which reads as follows:

Dear Detectives Vannatter and Lange: At our meeting today, I offered

to provide the services of Dr. Michael

Baden, Pathologist, and Dr. Henry Lee,

Criminologist, to aid in the

investigation of the murder of Nicole

Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman.

These gentlemen are employed by the

state governmental agency, and, in my

opinion, are the leading experts in the

United States. I think it is imperative prior to

internment, that a second autopsy be

performed that may produce evidence

relevant to the murders. Detective Tom Lange requested a

polygraph of Mr. Simpson. Mr. Simpson

will be willing to consider a polygraph

examination, with the stipulation that

the results would be admissible in any

potential criminal investigation. We have written" --

Appears to be a new paragraph.

At any rate, on the second page, quote: We have written to the
coroner,

requesting a second autopsy, and would

like you to contact the next of kin for

permission in this regard, since I feel

it would be inappropriate for me to

contact them directly during this

period.

It's signed Robert O. Shapiro.

Thank you.

Okay. It's my opinion that this is probably the most troublesome
aspect of this case that has been brought about by the reference by
defense of the polygraph, the failure of the plaintiff to object at
the time, and we are in a state of our case wherein reference to the
polygraph had been made.

The Court is satisfied that the state of the law is, polygraphic
evidence is not admissible by statute, as well as by case law in this
state. And the Court is inclined to not permit the evidence in this
regard.

Before counsel may be permitted to make any argument in closing
argument in this regard, I will visit this issue again and allow
counsel to submit points and authorities in that regard.

My inclination is not to permit at this point any further comment on
the polygraph, because to permit comment on it, it would appear to me,
it would be to permit a contention that the polygraph has probative
value as to truthfulness or untruthfulness, there being no evidence
being received in that regard. Number one.

Number 2, the Court, having the understanding that it's not admissible
evidence statutorily or by case law, that such comments should not be
permitted, possibly with the exception of a stipulation by counsel
that it were to be considered and there not be any such stipulation,
the Court, the same preclude any reference to polygraphs pending
further points and authorities on that issue.

MR. PETROCELLI: For the record, I want to object to the Court's
ruling.

He opened the door once in opening, after your Court's limiting
instruction, to which I objected because of the scope of it.

He then opened it up a second time on this witness's examination. He
elicited that Mr. Simpson, once again, wanted to take one. The
implication being if he had taken one, he would have passed. The
implication being that it was trustworthy and reliable as a scientific
device. And I don't see how I could possibly be precluded at this
time, after he elicited this testimony, from me responding to it.

THE COURT: Mr. Petrocelli, so far as I've seen, this far, based upon
all of your papers, your points and authorities, there is no
admissible evidence in that regard that you can offer.

MR. PETROCELLI: Mr. Simpson testified that he was hooked up to a
polygraph operator. And I can produce a witness that can say he did
take a test, irrespective of the outcome of the test. But it's unfair
for him to keep throwing this up to the jury and we can't respond to
it.

THE COURT: You have a witness that was present at the event?

MR. PETROCELLI: We have Robert Kardashian; we have the polygraph
operator, and we have whoever else was there. I'll serve a subpoena on
them and bring them in.

He keeps saying that Mr. Simpson would gladly and happily have taken a
test.

The fact is, he did take a test.

THE COURT: Well, how do you get around work product and privilege?

MR. PETROCELLI: How does he -- How does he get around opening up a
subject matter that, at the same time, he claims is work product and
privilege and then bars us --

THE COURT: Mr. Petrocelli --

MR. PETROCELLI: -- inquiring --

THE COURT: At this point, I'm going to stand on what I said today. I'm
not permitting any further movement on this issue, and I'm not going
to permit defense to argue this.

MR. PETROCELLI: He's precluded from asking any further evidence --
questions about this?

THE COURT: At this point.

MR. PETROCELLI: Including his --

THE COURT: You show me some points and authorities that allows to you
do that.

MR. BAKER: For the record, I, first of all, have disagreed with the
Court's opinion relative to the fact that -- that I opened the door in
opening statement.

As this Court is well aware, an opening statement is not evidence,
number one.

Number two, the -- the incident of this letter and the incident that
he's talking about are totally separate and apart.

Mr. Brewer gets up and announces to the jury in opening statement, the
title of my remarks is The Presumption of Guilt, Consciousness of
Guilt. This goes to the consciousness of innocence that was opened by
them. And I objected to the -- any going into the polygraph test by
Mr. Petrocelli.

We had a side-bar. I was totally overruled. And I've also moved for
mistrial on that basis.

And he opened the door and represented to this jury what a purported
score was, what it meant, and that Mr. Simpson took a test without any
good-faith belief in any of the above.

THE COURT: I've ruled on those issues already.

MR. BAKER: I understand.

MR. PETROCELLI: Well, for the record I did have a good-faith basis.

THE COURT: Okay.

(The following proceedings were held in open court, in the presence of
the jury.)

THE COURT: Ladies and gentlemen, you are excused until tomorrow at
8:30.

(The following proceedings were held at bench outside the presence of
the jury and counsel.)

THE CLERK: Yes. I wanted to enter into the record, I'm doing a nunc
pro tunc entry in the minute order regarding Plaintiffs' Exhibit 25.
It is not by reference, as I misstated on Friday, December 6. It is a
photograph that was admitted in evidence.

Thank you.

(At 4:40 p.m., an adjournment was taken until Tuesday, December 10,
1996, at 8:30 a.m.)

VS.

ORENTHAL JAMES SIMPSON, ET AL., DEFENDANTS.


SANTA MONICA, CALIFORNIA
FRIDAY, DECEMBER 6, 1996

DEPARTMENT NO. WEQ
HON. HIROSHI FUJISAKI, JUDGE

(REGINA D. CHAVEZ, OFFICIAL REPORTER)

(Jurors resume their respective seats.)

THE COURT: Morning.

JURORS: Good morning, Your Honor.

MR. PETROCELLI: Good morning, Your Honor.

MR. LAMBERT: Plaintiff calls Dr. Bruce Weir, Your Honor.

BRUCE WEIR, called as a witness on behalf of Plaintiffs, was duly
sworn and testified as follows:

THE CLERK: You do solemnly swear that the testimony you may give in
the cause now pending before this court shall be the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

THE WITNESS: I do.

THE CLERK: Sir, if you would, please state and spell your name.

THE WITNESS: It's Bruce Weir, W-e-i-r.

DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. LAMBERT:

Q. Good morning, Dr. Weir.

A. Good morning.

Q. Would you please tell the jury what your occupation is, sir.

A. I'm a -- a professor of statistics at North Carolina State
University.

Q. Could you briefly state for the jury, your formal educational
background, starting with your graduation from college.

A. I have an undergraduate degree taken in New Zealand in the subject
of mathematics. I did a Ph.D. in this country at -- at North Carolina
State University in statistics and genetics.

Q. What year did you receive your Ph.D.?

A. 1968.

Q. And after obtaining your Ph.D. in statistics and genetics, did you
do any postdoctoral study?

A. I had a one-year postdoctoral year out of U. C. Davis in the field
of genetics.

Q. And since that time, have you been affiliated with a university in
a teaching or study capacity?

A. Yes. I think I -- since 1970, I've been on the faculty of two
different universities, teaching and conducting research in the area
of statistics, as applied to genetics.

Q. What was what the first university, doctor?

A. It was a university that was back up in New Zealand.

Q. At some point, you joined the faculty at North Carolina State?

A. Yes. That was in 1976.

Q. What was your position there at North Carolina State, initially?

A. At this time, I was an associate professor of statistics.

Q. And what is your position now?

A. I -- I'm now a full professor of both statistics and genetics.

Q. Is that a tenured position at North Carolina State?

A. Yes, it is.

Q. Do you also hold any chairs at North Carolina State University?

A. I -- I have a title; it's called the William Neil Reynolds
Professorship.

Q. What is the duration of that professorship?

A. It's a lifetime appointment.

Q. Let me show you, Dr. Weir, a copy of your curriculum vitae, which
is Exhibit 435, Your Honor.

(The instrument herein referred to as Curriculum Vitae of Dr. Bruce
Weir was marked for identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 435.)

A. Thank you.

Q. (BY MR. LAMBERT) Dr. Weir, is this a current copy of your
curriculum vitae?

A. Yes, it is.

Q. Does this list, at least, the preponderance of the articles that
you have -- you have had published, Dr. Weir?

A. Yes, I believe so. It goes through earlier to 1996.

Q. It lists at least 106 articles that you've either authored or
coauthored?

A. That's correct.

Q. And a number of commentaries and several books, as well?

A. That's right, yes.

Q. And what is the field in which all of those articles and books have
been written?

A. They are all in the same field, and they talk about applying
statistical methods to analyze genetic data.

Q. Are some of those books and articles also dealing with the subject
of the forensic uses of DNA and statistical data?

A. Yes. For about the past four years, a lot my publications have been
in the area specifically to deal with the interpretation of a DNA
profile.

Q. And have you ever testified on that subject in court?

A. Yes, I have. About 20 times, I think.

Q. Have you been qualified as an expert on those occasions?

A. I have.

Q. And have any of those occasions been in courts in California?

A. Yes. I think three or four times.

Q. Let me now show you now, Dr. Weir --

MR. LAMBERT: We'll put on the Elmo, as well, and this will be the next
exhibit in order, Your Honor which is?

THE CLERK: 2231.

MR. LAMBERT: 2231.

(The instrument herein referred to as Document entitled Summary of
Mixture Frequencies was marked for identification as Plaintiffs'
Exhibit No. 2231.)

A. Thank you.

(Witness is handed document by counsel.)

(Exhibit 2231 is displayed on Elmo Screen.)

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Would you please, Dr. Weir, describe what this
document is?

A. Well, overall, it's a series of numbers that helps us to assess the
evidentiary strengths of some of the stains in this case, particularly
those stains where there are DNA from more than one person. So we call
these -- it's so called mixed stains.

Q. So the stains that are listed on the document which are listed on
the left-hand side, item 31, items 303, 304, and 305, and the various
nine items, those are all mixed stains, Dr. Weir?

A. That's right. All those stains contain DNA for more than one
person.

Q. And you've done a -- have you done a frequency calculation in
regard to those stains?

A. Yes, I have. These -- these are numbers I displayed that tell us
the probability of finding those particular types of mixed stains if
they came from two unknown people.

Q. So let's take, for example, item number 31, the top item, where the
Department of Justice obtained PCR results, indicating as a possible
source of that item, Mr. Simpson and Mr. Goldman.

What does your calculation in the right-hand column tell us about that
particular item?

A. That 6800 number tells us if we went into the population and took
from the population two people and typed them, we would find that they
had the same PCR profile as those in item 31.

You've got the 6800 plus the 19,000, and that's a fairly wide range
that reflects the fact that I used different data bases corresponding,
broadly speaking, to a different racial group of these two unknown
people.

Q. Taking the next item, 303, 304 and 305, where the Department of
Justice obtained RFLP results indicating possible sources of that
stain, that being Mr. Simpson and Mr. Goldman, could you explain your
frequency numbers there, please.

A. Yes.

Both the numbers are a great deal bigger in this case because the RFLP
profile, I believe, was based on four different probes. So it's quite
an extensive profile.

And in order to get that particular set of alleles, that set of bands,
and no other bands from two people taken at random is a fairly rare
event. And I've estimated that to be somewhere between 1 and 800
million and 1 and 4 billion.

Q. And the other calculations on this exhibit are all of the same sort
that you've described for 31 and 303?

A. That's correct. They all talk about the probability of seeing the
stain from two unknown people.

Q. Now, in doing this calculation, the frequency calculation that
you've done, you've calculated for two possible unknown persons being
the contributor to the stain.

Is it possible that three or four persons could have been the
contributors to those stains?

A. Well, it's certainly possible. We can't tell simply by looking at
the profile how many people are represented in the DNA.

We can tell by looking at the profile, because there were never more
than four alleles or four bands for each probe. That suggests that
there were any two contributors. But certainly there could be three or
four or even a bigger number, I suppose.

Q. And why did you choose to just calculate on this list for two
persons, as opposed to more?

A. For simplicity, mainly. That is, I think, the easiest and the most
-- the most obvious explanation of these profiles if they did not come
from the people named as the possible sources.

Q. And if you were to calculate the number of unknown contributors and
frequency of unknown contributors, three or four were considered, in
what way would the numbers change?

A. Generally speaking, these numbers become more extreme as the number
of contributors go up. It becomes increasingly difficult to have a
large number of people with only this particular set of alleles.

Now, there are exceptions, of course, to all general rules. And the in
the cases where there are fewer than four alleles, some of the RFLP
only had three bands. And then we have to do some very conservative
calculations to allow for there being an unseen band. So in those
cases, the numbers could go the other direction.

Q. In this presentation you've made, you believe this is the most
presentation of the frequencies for these particular stains?

A. I think it's the one consistent with the fact that there were never
more than four alleles at each probe.

Q. Now, these numbers that you've given us, these frequency numbers,
are they intended to be precise numbers, Dr. Weir?

A. Certainly not. These are estimates.

I'm a statistician. I cannot simply give you a single number. You've
always got to accompany this by some indication of how much reliance
we can put on these numbers.

Q. And what -- how would you accompany these particular numbers to
show the degree of reliance we can put upon them?

A. Well, the bottom line is that I would, particularly for the more
extreme numbers, both provide, and divide, and multiply by a factor of
10 to the 800 million. That's the best estimate from the data we have
available.

But I must say we should accompany that 800 million by a range
anywhere from 80 million to 8 billion, just in the same way when we
read public-opinion surveys in the newspaper, we see 47 percent
support the president, plus or minus 3 percentage points. The plus or
minus in these calculations is a lot bigger than 3 percent; it's about
a factor of 10.

Q. For example, on the RFLP results for 303, 304 and 305, if you
applied the factor of 10 to both the highest and lowest frequency,
another lowest would -- could become 89 -- lowest would be 89 million
and the highest would be 40 billion?

A. Yes. If the low end of the smallest number is 89 million and
biggest end of the largest number is 40 billion.

Q. The frequencies you put up here, your best estimate of those
frequencies based upon the available data?

A. Yes. I believe they are the appropriate numbers to report.

MR. LAMBERT: Your Honor, I'd move into evidence Exhibit 435 and this
new exhibit, number 2231.

THE COURT: Okay.

(The instrument previously marked as Plaintiffs' Exhibit 435 was
received in evidence.)

(The instrument previously marked as Plaintiffs' Exhibit 2231 was
received in evidence.)

MR. LAMBERT: I have no further questions, Your Honor.

Thank you.

THE COURT: Cross.

THE WITNESS: Thank you.

CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. BLASIER:

Q. Morning, Dr. Weir?

A. Good morning, sir.

Q. Yesterday, you were kind enough to submit to a deposition at Mr.
Baker's law office, with being present -- me being present, Mr.
Lambert being present; is that right?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And at that deposition, you explained that the assumptions that you
used to come up with the figures that you've presented were
assumptions chosen by yourself correct?

A. Yes, that's correct.

Q. Nobody told you to assume one thing versus another thing?

A. That's right.

Q. And in doing these calculations, you did a whole different -- all
sets of possible combinations of racial groups, to come up with a
range from one number to another number in terms of how common these
patterns might be. Is that a fair way to describe that?

A. That's absolutely right, yes.

Q. And what you tried to do was to use that combination that would
produce the number that is the most frequent number. In other words,
the number that would be most helpful to Mr. Simpson, for instance, on
one end of the range, and on the other end of the range, would be the
more extreme number that would be more incriminating; is that correct?

A. I think I understand.

I did a series of California calculations according to different
racial backgrounds of the unknown contributors and chose the ranges,
the smallest and the largest, yes.

Q. What you were trying to do is come up with the figures that would
be most favorable to the defense and least favorable, correct?

A. No. I'm just simply giving the range of numbers. I could have
presented the whole 16 numbers.

Q. Okay.

A. And this was just some.

Q. I'm sorry?

A. This was some to present the two ends of the ranges.

Q. The bottom end of the range is the number that is the most common
appearance of that particular pattern, correct?

A. That's true, yes.

Q. Now, in doing these calculations, did you try to be fair and
impartial to both sides?

A. Yes, as far as I know.

Q. Did you try to do that in all your calculations in the cases that
you worked on?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. Now, you have particular expertise in calculating statistics for
mixtures of different DNA patterns, correct?

A. Well, I've been thinking about it recently, yes.

Q. Well, you've done quite a bit of work in that area have not?

A. Over the last year.

Q. Is it accurate that you consider yourself to be perhaps the world's
foremost expert on that topic?

A. No. I wouldn't say that, no.

Q. Is there anybody you would put above you, in terms of level of
knowledge and ability, to calculate these kinds of numbers?

A. I don't think I want to play that kind of a game. But there are
several people who do these calculations just as well as I do.

Q. Anybody that does it better?

A. Oh, I'm sure there are.

Q. Who?

A. A Dr. Evett in the United Kingdom, Dr. Buckleton in New Zealand, I
would say, are at least as good as I am.

Q. Better than you?

A. Certainly.

Q. Anybody other than those two gentlemen in the world that are better
than you?

A. I don't think I should answer that because the -- the situation is
conceivable. Anybody who thought about this issue, who's a competent
statistician, would be at least as good as I am. So to put me on a
pedestal merely because I've thought about it is a little unfair.

Q. Would you say you thought about it more than anybody else, other
than those two gentlemen?

A. I couldn't answer that.

Q. Okay.

Is it fair to say that with DNA testing, it's broken down into three
basic steps: The first one being the generation of an Autorad or a
testing strip; the second one being the interpretation of that to
determine whether it matches the evidence -- matches the suspect; and
then the third step being what you do is calculate the frequencies of
the possibility that it might be someone else, as opposed to the
defendant, that resulted in that match; is that correct?

A. No. I have to restate -- state the last statement. These numbers
don't talk about the probability of coming from someone else; these
frequencies talk about the frequency or the probability of seeing this
probability, if it comes from someone else.

Q. It's very easy to get confused in the terminology that's used in
this, with respect to mixtures, is it not?

A. I don't think so. I think, if we think carefully and slowly, we'll
be fine.

Q. Would you agree with me, the three steps that I described, it's a
logical way to break down the analysis of DNA testing results?

A. Yes, I think that's fair.

Q. And you have nothing to do with the first part; that is, nothing to
do with what goes into generating an Autorad, collecting evidence, or
generating a DQ alpha testing, for instance?

A. That's right.

Q. And in your analysis, you don't have anything to do, really, with
the second step of determining whether or not there is a match to a
defendant in a case; is that correct?

A. No, I'm not competent to do that.

Q. Okay.

So your area of expertise is the third step; that is, calculating
these frequencies that you've talked about?

A. That's right.

Q. Now, where you're talking about an evidentiary stain that only has
two alleles, that's an indication that the source of that is one
person, correct?

A. If we see two alleles at every one of the probes used, yes.

Q. And calculating a frequency for that situation is a lot easier than
calculating frequency for mixture; would you agree with that?

A. I -- to a -- only to a degree. I think the concepts are the same.
We ask the question; here's the profile. What's the chance of that it
has this type, if it came from an unknown person? That's the single
stain.

For mixed stain, we say here's the profile. What's the chance it has
this stain? It came from two unknown people or three.

So it's really the same question.

Q. But with the single stain you're talking about, what's the chance
that if I go out into the population of Caucasians, for instance, and
pick somebody at random, that they would have that same pattern --
correct?

A. That's true.

Q. Now, where you're talking about mixed stains where there may be
two, three or four contributors, it gets more complex in terms of the
number of possible alternatives that you could have, that could
account for those results, other than the defendant contributing the
sample, correct?

A. Well, it's still the same question.

We just have more -- more people that could have contributed, so I
don't see a logical distinction.

But you're certainly right; there are more combinations in the sense
of different combinations of the different racial groups.

And I say "racial group" as the shorthand for the different data bases
I've been using.

Q. And if we take an example of a DQ alpha result that has four
alleles, this -- let's say the 1.1, the 1.2, the 1.3 and the 4 -- tell
me how you would analyze the number of -- the possible numbers of
people that could have created that stain.

A. Sir, we're talking about a stain where we know that there were four
alleles present?

Q. Correct.

A. And so let's start out with that.

We know that couldn't have come from one person -- one person.

So the next step would be to say, what's the chance of seeing these
four alleles if they came from two people. And then we need to say
what alleles do these two people have? And that's alleles 1, 2, 3, and
4 for the moment. What's the chance that two people have these four
alleles?

Well, the first person could have 1 and 2, and the second person could
have 3 and 4; that would work. Or the first person could have 1 and 3
and the second person could have 2 and 4; that would work. And we just
go through a list.

And I think there's about six different combinations of the way that
two people between them would have this particular set of those four
alleles.

Q. Now, if you wanted to take into account the number of -- possible
combinations of three people that could create that would be
consistent with those four alleles, how would you go about doing that?

A. Same question, same procedure.

We say here's four alleles, 1, 2, 3, 4. And I want to ask the
question, how likely is it that I see those four when I take three
people. So I take three people and I say, what does the first one
have.

Well, the first one could have 1 and 2; the second person might have a
3 and a 4; and then the third person doesn't have to do anything else
for the mixture because I've already got the four alleles accounted
for; so this third person could have any combination of those four
alleles.

The important thing is that person could not have any additional
allele. DQ alpha has six alleles, so that third person couldn't have a
5 and a 6.

So, once again, it's not difficult to say in words; it's a little
time-consuming to write down all the combinations.

And that's what I do. That's what I used to do a year ago. And that is
error prone when you write down a lot of combinations, it's easy to
leave some out. So with a little careful thinking, we came up with a
formula which said if these are the alleles, we need to account for --
if these are the number of people that we think account for them,
here's an equation, a formula which will tell you the probability.

Q. Now, you can do the same kind of analysis if there were four people
that contributed to that stain that has four alleles?

A. Certainly four, five, six, whatever.

Q. And then what you do, in order to come up with the range of numbers
that you've presented here, is to take each one of those possible
alternatives, and take all possible combinations of racial groups that
might fit into that combination of two people, three people or four
people, and calculate how common or what's the frequency of that
particular pattern in the population, and in the particular population
you choose, right?

A. That sounds right, yes.

Q. And you come up with a whole series of numbers; if you've got 16
possible combinations, you could have 16 different numbers, couldn't
you?

A. Well, as I say, that -- yes, but that's not the way we now do it,
we don't have a long list of numbers, we have an equation which spits
them out for us.

Q. You take the ends of it, you take the one that's most favorable to
the defense; in other words, the one that's the most common
possibility and then the one that's the least common possibility, or
the most rare?

A. We give the range, yes.

Q. Now, I want to take a look at 2231 for a minute.

(Exhibit 2231 displayed on Elmo.)

Q. That's not the first table that you generated in preparation for
your testimony today, is it?

A. The one -- the one we're talking about, no.

Q. In fact, you generated this table yesterday morning, correct?

A. Yes, that's right.

MR. BLASIER: Now, I want to mark as the next --

THE CLERK: 2232.

MR. BLASIER: 2232.

(The instrument herein described as a table generated by Dr. Weir was
marked for identification as Defendants' Exhibit No. 2232.)

Q. Let me show this to you first, and tell me if this is the one, the
table that you generated before you generated this one?

(Witness reviews exhibit.)

A. Yes, that's right.

Q. And when did you generate this one?

A. Earlier this week.

Q. I want to put them side by side, if we can fit them both.

Let's just get into these numbers.

(Indicating to documents.)

With respect to the stains G1 and G2, which were found on the
Rockingham glove, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. The table that you presented here today has the upper range number
as 1 in 300 billion, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And the one that you generated earlier this week has a number 1 in
200 billion, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. The 300 billion being 50 percent more than the 200 billion?

A. That's extremely large numbers, yes.

Q. The 300 billion being 50 percent more than the 200 billion,
correct?

A. Yes. The one extremely large number is 50 percent bigger than the
other extremely large number.

Q. The difference between the 300 billion is simply due to the
difference that you rounded or truncated numbers, right?

A. That's right, yes.

Q. It's the same underlying data, but it gives you different results
to the extreme of 100 billion possibilities, correct?

A. No, that's a misstatement.

Q. Well, what accounts for the difference between 200 billion and 300
billion?

A. When I generated the first number, I truncated the numbers then I
did when I generated the second number, it's the same underlying data.

Q. Same?

A. I chose to represent it differently.

Q. Same underlying data, same formula, correct?

A. Yes, sure.

Q. I'm sorry?

A. Yes.

Q. The numbers were different because you dropped some digits off on
the first one that you didn't on the second, correct?

A. No, no. The numbers that I put into my program to calculate the
formula were the same, and the numbers that came out were the same
numbers. I copied down off the screen, on my yellow piece of paper to
do the multiplication when I truncated and when I didn't, and that was
probably a foolish thing to do, trying to be overly conservative.

You wouldn't have seen this difference had I rounded -- I took numbers
like a 1.9 and called it a 1 on Tuesday and yesterday I called it a
1.9. Before I did the multiplication, if I had rounded I would have
called it a 2, and we wouldn't have seen this difference.

I was being -- I guess I was being lazy on Tuesday.

Q. Did Mr. Lambert or anybody tell you that you shouldn't be quite so
conservative and ask you to generate another table that was a little
bit more --

A. No, I've had no instruction from Mr. Lambert.

Q. No instruction at all. So you did that on your own?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, you testified in the criminal trial in 1995, did you not?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. How much time did you put into preparing -- doing your calculations
and preparations for your testimony in the criminal trial?

A. About three days in my hotel in Los Angeles.

Q. You did all of the work in three days?

A. I did.

Q. And about how much time have you put into the calculations that
you've done for the plaintiffs in this case?

A. Well, the immediate calculations have been just over the last week,
but I've had a year to write out the theory, to think about things, so
that these numbers reflect much greater theory than gestation.

MR. BLASIER: Next in order.

THE CLERK: 2233.

MR. BLASIER: 2233.

(The instrument herein described as a document entitled Frequencies
Most Favorable to Defense - Dr. Weir was marked for identification as
Defendants' Exhibit No. 2233.)

(Exhibit 2233 placed on Elmo.)

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Let me give you a copy of this.

I'd like you to take a look at that document and compare it to your
table.

And would you agree that in the left-hand column under "Item," we have
the same sets of stains that you have in your table, and just in
slightly different order?

A. They seem to be the same, yes.

Q. And what we're talking about here, so it's a little clearer, G10 is
a stain from the Rockingham glove, correct?

A. All the G'S are stains from the gloves, yes.

Q. Okay.

And there were PCR results from that particular stain, correct?

A. Right.

Q. And it's those PCR results from which you did your calculations,
correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And now you have testified in this case -- in the column that
you've labeled "Civil," this is the lower range numbers for these
various stains that you've testified to; is that correct?

A. They seem to be.

Q. So in other words, these are the numbers that --

A. No, no, no. Well, you throw me with the different order.

Q. Yeah, go ahead, take your time.

A. It would have been easier to do it in the same order that I had
done.

Q. Well, there's a reason --

A. These look to be the same.

Q. Okay.

A. No, I think there's one difference.

Q. Which one?

A. 303, those are just PCR. We left out the larger numbers from the
RFLP.

Q. That's correct.

So the numbers that are on there --

A. Some -- there are some RFLP numbers.

Q. Correct.

A. We've left out some. What have we left out? You have to help me.

Q. I think 303, 304, 305 RFLP.

A. Okay. Thank you.

Q. The numbers up there, this is what you -- the hypothesis that you
adopted, the assumptions that you made to come up with numbers that
you felt were most favorable to the defense, correct?

A. Now, you have to restate that for me.

Q. The numbers that I have here in the "Civil" column are the
frequencies that you've presented here that are the lower ends of the
range that you felt, in doing your calculations, were the ones that
were most favorable to the defense?

A. In the case where the stains came from two contributors.

Q. Dr. Weir, do you remember testifying in your deposition when I
asked you -- (Reading:) Q. Why did you only do calculations for pairs
of people rather than for also three contributors and four
contributors?

Your answer was: Because this is the more conservative number.

Remember saying that yesterday?

A. Yes, I said that, and as I said in my direct examination, that's
generally true. There are exceptions to that, particularly for the
RFLP where there are some unseen bands.

Q. Well, you didn't qualify yesterday, did you?

A. No, I didn't, but as a result of you asking me that, I thought
about it again and I actually did those calculations, and we can go
through them if you wish.

Q. Well, I think we will.

And you said also in the deposition that, when questioned --
(Reading:) Q. So when you say more conservative?

Your answer was -- (Reading:) More favorable to the defense.

Correct?

A. That's true.

Q. Now, what you're telling us now is that these numbers aren't
necessarily the ones that are the most favorable to the defense,
correct?

A. No. What I said on my direct examination, and again on cross, is
that these numbers are the most conservative assuming two
contributors. That's my testimony.

Q. But they aren't the most conservative numbers, are they?

A. We can have --

Q. Dr. Weir --

A. We could have other explanations, which might get more
conservative.

Q. More favorable to the defense, right?

A. In some stains, that might be the case.

Q. And you didn't do those calculations until I questioned you --
until after I questioned you yesterday, correct?

A. No, I didn't, because I thought that generally that wouldn't be
appropriate.

Q. You were trying to come up with the number, the lower range that
were most favorable to the defense?

A. That's right. And as a general rule, that's what happens. I would
be happy to make other calculations.

Q. You're the one who chooses which assumptions to make which
calculations to present to this jury?

A. Yes, I did the simplest ones consistent with the evidence, which
has 4 alleles to the probe, which suggests two contributors.

Q. You didn't do the ones that were most favorable to the defense, did
you?

A. Most cases I did.

Q. Some cases you didn't, did you?

A. That's right.

Q. Now, in the criminal trial, you testified, did you not, that the
frequency most favorable to the defense for G10 for the PCR results
was 1 in 3900; isn't that correct?

A. I have no idea.

Q. You want to -- I asked you that yesterday, if you reviewed your
trial testimony, correct?

A. I've read the transcript. I don't remember the numbers.

Q. Let me refer you to 33775 of the criminal trial transcript,
starting at line 27, would you look at that to yourself, you can look
above it too, as well, and tell me if you did not, in your direct
testimony in the criminal case, state the frequency of G10, the most
favorable to the defense, as 1 in 3900?

A. Well, it's not laid out here. Looks like the 3900 goes -- yes, it
does say there are two contributors, that's right.

Q. Let's write 3900 under G10 criminal trial number one.

Now, during the course of your cross-examination in the criminal
trial, the defense made you aware of the fact that you had made a
mistake, hadn't you?

A. Yes, and I left out one of the DQ Alpha bands, yes.

Q. And what you did was, you didn't count all the possible
combinations that might result from the presence or absence of the 1.2
allele in the DQ Alpha system; isn't that correct?

A. That's right. That's the danger of trying to enumerate instead of
using a formula, yes.

Q. That was as a result of a fundamental misunderstanding that you had
about the DQ Alpha system and the 1.2 allele, isn't it?

A. No, I think the record is clear that that's exactly wrong. I have a
complete understanding of that at this time. When I read the program
in the hotel room, I left out a line.

Q. So you understood at the time that where there was a 1.2 allele in
the DQ Alpha system, that sometimes you could tell it was there and
sometimes you can't; isn't that correct?

A. That's right.

Q. You knew that?

A. Oh, I knew it, yes.

Q. So you went back and recalculated the numbers after the defense
brought to your attention your mistake and presented a second number,
1 in 1600, isn't that correct, for G10?

A. You have to tell me the page.

Q. Same page.

A. You have to tell me the page number.

MR. P. BAKER: 33775.

MR. BLASIER: 33775 to 33776.

(Mr. Blasier assists witness with transcript.)

A. Thank you.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Is that -- isn't that correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Let's cross out the 3900 because that's an error and let's put 1 in
1600 which is the second number you gave in the criminal trial, okay.

And the reason for that error was you didn't count the 1.2 allele
combinations that could have been there. Correct?

A. That's fine.

Q. Let's put 1.2000 (sic) there, shorter band. That's the reason for
that error.

Now, Dr. Weir, your testimony today in the civil case is that that
frequency that's most favorable to the defense is 1 in 2600, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And that's because this number that you testified to under oath in
your cross-examination in the criminal trial was wrong, correct?

A. No.

Q. Is it the right number?

A. It's not the most appropriate number. It's not wrong, however.

Q. Remember yesterday, in your deposition, we asked questions about
that?

A. Yes. And I was -- I think we talked some time to explain the
difference between appropriate numbers and wrong numbers. The number
is correct. And I'm sure you recall that I said it was not a mistake.

Q. So you don't call it a mistake?

A. The number is correct. What it is, I had doubled it, I think,
unnecessarily.

Q. I asked you a question, is it a proper way to do it, to count that
combination twice, which is the reason why -- for the difference of 1
in 1600 and 1 in 2600, and you said no. Correct?

A. That's not the proper way to present it. The calculations were
correct. I think it's better to present it the way I have now.

Q. You counted one set of alternatives twice, that's why this number
is almost half of this number, isn't that true?

A. That's right.

Q. And that's not the proper way to do it, is it?

A. The calculations are correct. I don't think it was the proper way
to present it. I notice, however, that these numbers are consistent,
they both fall in the ranges of the others I've already presented.

Q. Dr. Weir --

A. I don't think -- I can't get excited about it, using 1600 and 2600.
I have already --

Q. My question is --

A. I haven't finished.

Q. My question is, the criminal trial number is not the proper number,
is it?

A. It's not the number I would give now, no.

Q. And that's because of the double situation that you described,
correct?

A. That's right.

Q. So let's put down, up here, reason, in red, for that improper
number.

Now, in the criminal trial, on your direct testimony, for stains 303,
304 and 305 PCR, you testified that the frequency most favorable to
the defense in that case was 1 in 1400, didn't you?

A. You have to tell me the page number. I don't have any of these
numbers in my mind.

Q. 33774.

A. I see the 1400 here.

Q. Why don't you write 1400 -- 1 in 1400 in that column.

Then, after you were cross-examined in the criminal trial, you
recognized that you had made the same mistake with respect to the 1.2
allele on that number, isn't that true?

A. All the calculations I did involving DQ Alpha in my hotel room were
wrong.

Q. Dr. Weir, you recognized that you made the same mistake with that
number that you had made with G10, correct?

MR. LAMBERT: Asked and answered. He just said that, he just answered
that.

MR. BLASIER: No, he didn't answer the question.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. I changed my computer program once, one line, one program, which
changed all the DQ Alpha results.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) This number was wrong, wasn't it?

A. All the numbers involved in DQ Alpha were wrong.

Q. Including this one?

A. All the numbers involved in DQ Alpha were wrong for the same one
line in one computer program.

Q. Now, when you calculated again for your cross-examination in the
criminal trial, you presented a number of 1 in 570 as the now correct
number, isn't that accurate?

A. As to then correct number.

Q. The right number?

A. As the number -- that was the number I presented then, yes.

Q. Let's put 1 in 570. Then this was the 1.2 error. Let's write 1.2
over here. Let's cross out this number and let's cross out this number
too.

Now, you've testified that the proper number for 303, 304, 305 for the
PCR results is 1 in 960, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. That's because of the double issue, counting something twice that
shouldn't have been counted twice, correct?

A. That's right.

Q. So let's cross out 1 in 570 and put double over here.

MR. BLASIER: Could I have a number next in order.

THE CLERK: 2234.

MR. BLASIER: 2234?

THE CLERK: Yeah.

(The instrument herein described as document entitled "Results of DNA
Analysis - Bronco automobile" was marked for identification as
Defendants' Exhibit No. 2234.)

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Doctor, let me show you Exhibit 2234.

Remember looking at this yesterday?

A. Yes.

Q. And that being the results that you testified to in the criminal
case for various stains?

A. I think that's right as -- I can't remember all the numbers. That
looks like it.

Q. Isn't it accurate, that for stain 303, 304 and 305, the number most
favorable to the defense was not any of these numbers, but was the
number that you derived if there were three possible -- I'm sorry --
four possible contributors; isn't that correct?

A. At that time, yes.

Q. And that number is 1 in 41, isn't it?

A. That number was, yes, um-hum.

Q. That's the number that's most favorable to the defense, is it not?

A. No, because that number is not the appropriate one at that time --
at that time it was, yes.

Q. Okay.

Let's write 1 in 41 here. And let's just write MC, for multiple
contributors.

MR. P. BAKER: Under the reason?

MR. BLASIER: Yeah.

(Mr. Philip Baker complies.)

A. Would you tell me what you've done, please.

Q. I'm sorry?

A. This -- excuse me. You have to tell me what you've done there.

Q. I wrote MC for multiple contributors.

We get a more favorable number from you where more than --

A. No, no, I must protest. That 41 is not a number I'm testifying to
here.

Q. You testified to it in the criminal trial, didn't you?

A. Yes.

Q. Thank you.

A. It's not a number I'm testifying to here. It's not the appropriate
number for mixed contributors.

Q. It was appropriate when you testified in the criminal trial?

A. That's not -- that was the correct number that had the double
issue. I would no longer talk about it now.

Q. Oh, so now this one is wrong as well?

A. Well, all --

Q. For more than one contributor?

A. All these numbers which had multi contributors will be wrong, in
that sense, um hum.

Q. Let's cross this one out then.

A. But that's not a number -- you're misstating my -- my testimony
here this morning. I haven't testified to a four contributor number
here.

Q. I understand you didn't. You did in the criminal trial?

A. I haven't made a mistake here on the four numbers.

Q. The number that's most favorable to the defense is the situation
where you have four contributors, as you testified at the criminal
trial, and that number, at that time, was 1 in 41, which is now wrong,
correct?

A. You have to tell me what the question is.

Q. At the criminal trial, you testified that the most frequent number
-- the most frequent situation where you would get that pattern from
picking people from the population at random was with four
contributors and you would get that pattern 1 in 41 times, wouldn't
you?

A. You wouldn't get it. That's what I said then. That's not the answer
I'd give today.

Q. Okay.

The number's wrong because of the double issue, correct?

A. That's right. It's substantially wrong.

Q. It's certainly -- it's going to be -- it's not going to be any more
than 1 in 82, is it?

A. Oh, yes, it is.

Q. All right.

Do you have any idea what the correct number is for four contributors?

A. I've offered to go through them with you. I have them with me.

Q. What is the correct number now for four contributors?

A. May I refer to my notes?

Q. Sure.

A. We're talking about 303, 4 and 5?

Q. Correct.

A. For four contributors, about 6400 to 140,000.

Q. So it's now 1 in 6400 for four contributors.

What's the difference, the double issue, the error you made in the
criminal trial?

A. That's right.

Q. For G11 and G13, two glove stains, the PCR number you testified to
in the criminal trial, I'll represent to you, was 1 in 14. Sound
right?

A. I'll -- just say that again. For G11, 13 --

Q. On your direct testimony in the criminal trial, you testified --

A. I'm just looking for the --

Q. Now, the charts you're looking at --

A. I don't --

Q. The second set of numbers, I'll represent to you --

A. Oh.

Q. -- to save time, that it was 1 in 14.

A. For how many contributors?

Q. Two, I believe.

1 in 14 here, please.

And again you made the same error on that one that you made on the one
above, it is double -- I'm sorry, the 1.2 error, I'm sorry, you did
not make that error on that one. That doesn't have 1.2 allele.

You're not testifying that the number most favorable to the defense is
the 1 in 27 rather than the 1 in 14, correct?

A. The 1 in 27 is the number for two contributors.

Q. Is the more appropriate number?

A. Yes.

Q. So let's cross this one off.

And again that's the doubling issue that we talked about, correct?

A. That's right.

Q. And in the criminal trial -- you can look at that, refer to that
chart -- you testified that actually the most favorable number for the
defense for three contributors was 1 in 7, did you not?

A. I don't have the glove chart. We're talking about the glove still,
aren't we?

Q. Oh, I'm sorry.

MR. BLASIER: Next in order, please.

THE CLERK: 2235.

(The instrument herein described as a document entitled "results of
DNA analysis - Rockingham glove" was marked for identification as
Defendants' Exhibit No. 2235.)

(Counsel hands Exhibit 2235 to the witness.)

A. So for the G11, the three contributor number at this time I
reported as 1 in 7 to 1 in 1300.

Q. All right. Let's write 1 in 7 here.

Are you saying now that's the wrong number, too?

A. I don't follow you. We're talking about the civil -- the criminal
trial number?

Q. No. This is the number you gave in the criminal trial.

A. Well, I thought --

Q. For three contributors?

A. I thought we agreed we were not using those numbers.

Q. I'm asking you about prior testimony under oath, Dr. Weir, the
number you gave under oath in the criminal trial, in your
cross-examination.

A. Was 1 in 7.

Q. Was 1 in 7?

A. Yes, uh-huh.

Q. Which is about four times more frequent than the 1 in 27, correct?

A. Yes. But it's not the number I would give today.

Q. Well, I understand that.

A. So that's --

Q. Is this more accurate?

A. No.

Q. Cross it off.

Why isn't it accurate, doubling issue?

A. Yes.

Q. Double -- oh, we got that already. We got two double errors -- I'm
sorry, we got one.

Now, for G1, G2 and G4, the PCR results, I'll represent to you that
your criminal trial direct testimony was that that number, the most
frequent pattern favorable to the defense is 1 in 240.

And that was wrong, correct?

A. Yes. It's not the number I would give today. It's not the number I
did give today.

Q. And you give a number of 1 in 430, twice as rare as what you gave
in the criminal trial?

A. That's right.

Q. That's again because of double?

A. Yes.

MR. LAMBERT: Objection, cumulative, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled. It's the same issue of course.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Now, 31 -- PCR results in No. 31 -- 31 is again a
stain from the Bronco, correct?

A. Right.

Q. I'll represent to you that your criminal trial testimony was 1 in
4700. Your testimony here today is 1 in 6800, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And so the 1 in 4700 is not the appropriate number, is it?

A. That's not what I testified here today.

Q. Okay. Cross it off.

And what's another difference between these two numbers?

A. It's this double issue.

Q. Okay.

Let's put double.

A. It's the same issue.

Q. And for 31, you testified that for four contributors, in the
criminal trial, the frequency most favorable to the defense would be 1
in 1300, correct? That's on your chart?

A. Do I have 31 on this chart?

Q. It may be on the other one, on the Bronco?

A. Oh.

Q. Yes?

A. Yes. The four number that time was 1 in 1300. It's not now.

Q. That would be wrong?

A. Yes. I would give 150,000.

Q. What is the difference between what you gave under oath?

A. It's the same double issue.

Q. We got two double situations here, right?

A. No, it's only one. There's only one issue in all these things.

Q. But it's -- the reason this number is wrong and the reason this
number is wrong are both because of the doubling issue, right?

A. Well, I think that's right.

Q. G12 and G14, the PCR results, I'll represent you testified at the
criminal trial the most frequent occurrence was 1 in 6.

And your testimony here today is that that actual number is 1 in 11,
correct?

A. My estimate is 1 in 11. It's not the actual number.

Q. So your estimate. All right.

And this one's wrong. All right.

And that's another double issue; is that correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, the G4, the RFLP results, your testimony here is that the
number most favorable to the defense is 1 in 1 billion, correct?

A. That's right.

Q. At the criminal trial?

A. That's the number from the two contributors, yes.

Q. For the two contributors.

The criminal trial you testified that that number was 1 in 1 million,
correct?

A. Do I have that written down here?

Q. We talked about it yesterday, remember that?

A. Yes. I'd like to see it.

Q. What? It's on your chart.

A. Yes, that's right.

Q. That's a thousand-fold difference, isn't it?

A. That's right.

No -- Yes, excuse me. Yes.

Q. 1 billion is a thousand times more than 1 million?

A. Yes. Thank you, yes.

Q. Which is the right one?

A. The 1 billion is the more accurate estimate.

Q. So let's cross out the 1 million.

Tell me why you made that mistake?

A. I have no idea.

Q. You have no idea, whatsoever, how you made that mistake, do you?

A. No.

Q. Let's put a question mark there.

Now, the number for multiple contributors most favorable to the
defense for G4 is 1 in 20,000, is it not what you testified to at the
criminal trial?

A. Are we still talking RFLP or PCR?

Q. RFLP.

A. The RFL -- This is G4, RFLP -- and tell me again the question.

Q. The --

A. The three contributor number.

Q. Is the number that's most favorable to the defense 1 in 20,000?

A. The three contributor was 1 in 20,000.

Q. Which is substantially different than 1 in a billion, is it not?

A. You could say that, yes.

Q. And that was --

A. That's not the today number, of course.

Q. So this one is wrong, too. Let's cross it out.

That's another double issue?

A. Yes.

Q. Do you know -- all right. Double. And MC for multiple contributors.

A. So the three number I think is a hundred million.

Q. So G1 and G2, the RFLP results, again we're talking about glove
stains at the criminal trial.

You testified that the number most favorable to the defense was 1 in 6
million, correct?

A. I think that's right, yes.

Q. You testified here today that the more accurate number is 1 in 6
billion, correct?

A. That's right.

Q. Again, thousand-fold difference, correct?

A. That's right. It's the same -- it's the same difference because
it's the same probes, that's really the same stain. They have almost
an identical profile so that is a little misleading to separate them
like that.

Q. Let's cross it off. It's wrong, right? Correct?

And you have no idea where this number came from?

A. It's the same -- it's the same discrepancy.

Q. Okay.

Let's put a question mark over there.

And the most favorable number that you testified to in the criminal
trial was for three contributors for this stain and it was 1 in 3,000,
correct?

A. This is G2. Yes, the 3,000 was the number then. The number now is
vastly different.

Q. So let's cross that out.

And is that again the double issue?

A. Yes, it's the same issue.

Q. Double.

Now, number 9, the PCR results from the glove, I'll represent to you
that you testified that the number most favorable to the defense in
the criminal case was 1 in 14.

And you've testified here today that the number, the more accurate
number is 1 in 29, correct?

A. That's right.

Q. Twice as rare as what you said in the criminal trial?

A. That's right.

Q. And this one's wrong, correct?

A. The number is --- the number is calculated correctly, but it's not
the number to present the 29.

Q. It's not the proper number?

A. It's not the number I would present.

Q. Not the number?

A. It's not the number to present.

Q. It's not the proper number?

THE COURT: Come on, Mr. Blasier, let's get on with this.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Let's cross it off.

And the number that you presented in the criminal trial for three
contributors for stain No. 9 as the one most favorable to the defense
is 1 in 4; isn't that correct?

A. That's right, yes.

Q. Now, is that one right or wrong?

A. That's -- I wouldn't present it today.

Q. Okay. Cross it off.

And that's again the double issue for this one and the doubling issue
for that one, correct?

A. That's right.

Q. So we had double over here.

Now, at your deposition you turned over some articles that you had
written, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And you were ordered to turn over a paper called or from the --
called the Promaga (sic) Conference, correct?

A. Yes. I didn't know that I was ordered. I did turn it over.

Q. That was a conference that you made a presentation at approximately
when?

A. I think it was October of '95.

Q. And in that paper you discuss the appropriate way to calculate some
of these frequencies, correct?

A. That's right.

Q. And you also presented me with an article from "Advanced Forensic
Haemogenetics," correct?

A. "Advances in Forensic Haemogenetics."

Q. Why don't you spell that one so we don't ruin the court reporter's
weekend.

A. Haemogenetics. It's h-a-e-m-o-genetics.

THE COURT REPORTER: Thank you.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) That also discusses the procedure that you
advocate for calculating percentages and mixtures, correct?

A. That's right.

Q. And you also presented a chapter from one of your books called
"Genetic Data Analysis," correct?

A. A section of a chapter, yes.

Q. Now, you actually wrote an article about the Simpson case, after
the criminal case, that you didn't present yesterday; isn't that
correct?

A. That's right.

Q. And that's an article which detailed DNA statistics in the Simpson
matter from "Nature, Genetics, Volume 11, December 1995," correct?

A. That's right.

Q. Now, let me ask some questions about what those numbers don't take
into account.

You would agree that these numbers assume that the evidence was
properly collected, properly processed, there was no planting, no
cross-contamination, that the actual results that the lab got were all
correct, don't they?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection, argumentative, assumes facts not in evidence,
beyond the scope, and in addition, the results have been admitted.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Isn't that correct?

A. I'm not -- I think I need to answer carefully.

The calculations I do, start with the profile determination given to
me by the forensic scientists. What -- Anything that goes on before
then is beyond my knowledge or expertise.

Q. Okay.

But you're making the assumption that these results are the correct
results?

THE COURT: I'm going to sustain my own objection. I think the witness
answered the question.

MR. BLASIER: Okay.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Tell me if you agree with the following statement:
It is essential that the integrity of DNA evidence with regard to
collection, potential contamination or tampering be beyond doubt?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection, beyond the scope.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. LAMBERT: Assumes facts not in evidence.

THE COURT: Just testify to numbers.

MR. BAKER: Can we be heard on this?

THE COURT: No.

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, this is his writing.

THE COURT: He's testified to numbers.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) The integrity of your numbers depends on the
integrity of the underlying evidence, does it not?

A. I don't see the connection.

I'm saying that the calculations follow from the profile. Anything
else is not -- is not here. I've taken the profile, done some
calculations. I don't know what else to say.

Q. You're assuming that the evidence was properly collected and
properly tested, aren't you?

MR. LAMBERT: Um --

THE COURT: Sustained.

Excuse me, Mr. Blasier, you can develop, if you can, through competent
examination and competent evidence any issues in this regard. That
does not permit this witness -- I will permit examination of this
witness on that. You may examine him as to his computations.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) Now, Dr. Weir, you've testified here, I think you
said it a couple of times, that the methods that you used here and the
statistics that you have presented, are the most appropriate, correct?

A. Yes, I think I said that.

Q. Isn't it true, that it is actually your belief that the more
appropriate statistics to present are not these, but likelihood
ratios?

A. I -- we're talking words, Mr. Blasier. These are -- these are --
can be interpreted as likelihood ratios. The numbers are the same.

Q. The numbers aren't the same, are they, Dr. Weir?

A. Mr. Blasier, I'm the statistician. The numbers are the same.

Q. You said several times in the writings that you gave me, and in
this article that I've talked to you about, that the more appropriate
statistics, rather than these numbers, is a likelihood ratio, correct?

A. You are misquoting me.

The numbers are the same. They've been presented in court today as
either frequencies or probabilities, which they are. They could
equally have -- well have been described as likelihood ratios. The
numbers, however, are identical.

Q. Don't you point out in your paper that the requirements of
likelihood ratios not being presented in the criminal trial emit that
only certain numbers were given which ironically could have hurt the
defense's case.

MR. LAMBERT: Objection, beyond the scope, irrelevant what happened in
the criminal trial.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. You are quoting from my paper? I said that.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) I am. And you still agree with that?

A. Yes.

Q. Let's go to the bottom of this chart.

And in that paper, you used as an example from the criminal trial,
stain No. 31, which you've testified to about here that for four
unknown contributors, the probability of the RFLP profile in Item 31
varies between 1 and 240 million and 1 in 2.7 billion, correct?

A. I'm not sure what the question is.

Q. In your paper, you state that for four unknown contributors with
respect to stain No. 31, the probability for the RFLP profile varies
between 1 in 240 million and 1 in 2.7 billion, correct?

A. I don't have the paper. If you're reading it, I must have said
that.

Q. I'll show you.

(Witness reviews document.)

A. Yes. You read that accurately.

Q. Okay.

Can we write 240 million to 2.7 billion, please. Just do an M.

A. Excuse me, I don't think I'm testifying about RFLP for 31.

Q. Well, I'm going to ask you about that.

Then you say further on your paper, that if you consider that --
rather than four unknown contributors, only have two unknown
contributors, that the number gets reduced to 1 in 200,000, which
would be much more favorable to the defense, correct?

A. That's right. That's consistent with what we've -- we were talking
about earlier. The more contributors you have the less likely it is
that those higher number of people have a particular profile.

Q. Well, the number --

A. So it -- that's the general statements that I made to you earlier.

Q. The number of unknown contributors also makes a difference in terms
of what a likelihood ratio number would be and a frequency number;
isn't that correct?

A. No.

Q. Then you say in your paper that if the defense had been willing to
concede that the blood in the Bronco was consistent or was from Mr.
Simpson, then there would be a difference in the numbers that would
reduce the frequency to 1 in 1,000, correct?

A. Well, you're asking me quite from memory. If that's the quote, then
it's correct.

Q. Let me show you.

MR. LAMBERT: Before they put these numbers up, Your Honor, I would
like to ask whether they are conceding in fact the blood in the Bronco
belongs to Mr. Simpson. It appears to be the thrust of the question.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. Yes, that's right.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) And the tone of that, would you agree, is that
again if the defense had done it the right way, with your assumptions
that you make in that article, they would have come up with a much
more favorable number than the way they wanted to do it, correct.

MR. LAMBERT: Objection, argumentative.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. I'm not sure what the question is. What the quotes you wrote out or
are accurate. I think they speak for themselves.

Q. The point you're making there is, is it not, that had the defense
done it the way you thought was the appropriate way, with more
reasonable assumptions, they would have come up with numbers much more
favorable to the defense than they actually did?

A. That's not what I said, and it's certainly not what I meant.

Q. What did you mean?

A. The words "more appropriate" are not in this article or in my mind.

Q. What did you mean by this example, then?

A. Simply, as I said, if the defense had stipulated to one of the
contributors, then the numbers change.

Q. Become much more favorable, correct?

A. In this case, yes.

Q. Now, Dr. Weir, by the way, was that article peer reviewed?

A. No. Well, excuse me. Yes, it was. It was invited and then it was
reviewed before it was accepted.

Q. And how many people reviewed it?

A. Well, the editor told me of two.

Q. And the peer review process involves someone else with
qualifications similar to yourself, I presume, reviewing your work,
checking your data, making sure that what you've stated in here is
accurate; is that fair to say?

A. That's the peer review process.

Q. I'm sorry?

A. Yes, that's the peer review process.

Q. Now, tell me, Dr. Weir -- oh incidentally, by the way, none of
these frequency calculations takes into account the possibility that
an Asian person might have contributed to some of these stains,
correct?

A. The numbers presented here haven't used an Asian data base.

Q. And so we're -- and Asians make up about what percentage of the
world's population?

A. Well --

MR. LAMBERT: Objection, irrelevant.

THE COURT: Sustained as to the world population, yes.

Q. Well, United States population?

A. I don't know.

Q. A lot, right?

A. What can I say.

Q. And your numbers don't even count the possibilities that an Asian
might have contributed?

A. No, that's not what I said. The numbers presented are not based on
Asian data. I can talk about Asian frequencies if you wish.

Q. You didn't present any?

A. I didn't present any.

Q. Now, this article that was peer reviewed, where you talk about Item
31, and a four probe RFLP match, where did you get your information
that there was a four probe RFLP match for Item 31?

A. I don't remember at this time if it -- I imagine it came from the
proceedings of the criminal trial if I -- if that's what I said.

Q. Can you find --

A. I don't recall. I'm having trouble with this. I don't recall 31
having an RFLP or am I wrong?

Q. You're correct here that 31 did not have any RFLP results, but your
article that was peer reviewed said it did, correct?

A. Whatever the article says doesn't make it a fact.

Q. And that's wrong in your article, isn't it?

A. If is says that and if it wasn't that, it's not true. That's true.

MR. BLASIER: Thank you. I have no further questions.

THE COURT: 10-minute recess, ladies and gentlemen. Don't talk about
the case. Don't form or express any opinions.

(Recess.)

(Jurors resume their respective seats.)

(The following proceedings were held in open court, in the presence of
the jury.)

THE COURT: Okay. Your redirect.

REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. LAMBERT:

Q. Dr. Weir, you testified on cross-examination that you made some
calculation mistakes when you did the calculations of the frequencies
at the criminal trial?

A. That's right, yes.

Q. What were the circumstances under which you did those calculations?

MR. BLASIER: Objection, irrelevant.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. Well, the prosecution called me to Los Angeles two weeks earlier
than they said they would. At that time when I went out, I'd done no
calculation for more than two contributors. The prosecution asked me
to do three-contributor calculations, which I did in my hotel room.
After testifying about them for a full day, the judge ordered me to do
four-person calculation before 9 o'clock the following morning.

I think my only mistake was in agreeing to work under those
conditions.

Q. (BY MR. LAMBERT) The calculations that you presented to the jury
today, were those calculations done under those kind of conditions?

A. No, sir.

Q. What conditions were they done under?

A. Well, after the trial, I -- as I said earlier, I sat down and
thought about the issue a little more carefully, and developed some
formulas to avoid having to do these tedious enumerations. So it's
almost 18 months since I first met this problem, and I've had the
opportunity to think about it a great deal.

Q. And have you been able to put that formula into your computer so
you can avoid having to do hand calculations in these matters?

A. I have.

Q. And these calculations that you presented here today, they're the
result of that -- of the use of that formula?

A. They are.

Q. Have you presented some of these same results in some of these
seminars you've attended with other statisticians to review them?

A. I was present for some of the conversation and several forums and
I've also had the methodology peer review that will appear in the
press early next year.

Q. And, Dr. Weir, are you comfortable that these numbers are the
appropriate numbers to be presented to this jury for the frequencies
that are set forth on them?

A. I am.

MR. LAMBERT: Thank you. No further questions.

THE COURT: Recross.

RECROSS-EXAMINATON BY MR. BLASIER:

Q. Dr. Weir, how long have you been a statistician?

A. Oh, probably since 1965.

Q. And you teach statistics, don't you?

A. Yes, I do.

Q. You have students and you have them do calculations, don't you?

A. I do.

Q. And you've done these kind of calculations all your life, haven't
you?

A. Which ones exactly?

Q. Probable -- conditional probabilities?

A. I've done some of them a long time, yes.

Q. In the field of conditional probabilities, it's a topic that's been
part of statistics for years; isn't that true?

A. Oh, I understand the methodology very well, but I'm not going to be
responsible for particular implementation done on the trying
conditions.

Q. When were you hired by the prosecution in the criminal case?

A. We're not -- you mean when they first discussed it?

Q. Yes.

A. At the beginning of '95 I think.

Q. When did you testify?

A. Well, I'm going to answer that slowly.

The issue of mixtures arose in the middle of May. I testified in June.

Q. The chapter in your book that talks about mixtures is from 1990,
isn't it?

A. No, no. '96.

Q. I asked you to write down the citation for this book, the chapter
which you gave me yesterday, didn't I?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And you wrote down genetic data analysis to 1990, didn't you?

A. No, sir.

Q. What's the number?

A. 1996, sir.

Q. Let's take a look under the Elmo.

A. It's also referred to on my curriculum vitae.

Q. Now, Dr. Weir --

MR. BLASIER: Take it off.

A. That is a 1996.

Q. Thank you, sir.

Now, Dr. Weir --

MR. PETROCELLI: Can you put it up there so the jury can see.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) You knew you were going to be asked to testify
under oath, in a murder case where someone was on trial for their life
in May?

A. That was in mid May. At this time I was told I would be called
sometime late in July. I then went on vacation and thought in the
middle of June -- I was called on the 17th of June to be in Los
Angeles on the 19. I testified on the 23.

Q. Did you ever tell the prosecutors, gee, I really need more time to
do my addition and subtraction and multiplication better?

A. As I said, that was my mistake, to be bullied by lawyers on both
sides.

Q. You let yourself be bullied by lawyers on both sides; is that your
testimony?

A. That's what I said.

Q. Now, how long have you been working with the DQ Alpha system?

A. I'm not sure. I'm not sure what you mean. I don't work with the DQ
Alpha system.

Q. How long have you been working with statistics that relate to DQ
Alpha results?

A. Well, my systems are not specific to a particular probe, so -- I've
been working in this area since 1990.

Q. 1990?

A. Um-hum.

Q. And the mistake that you made with respect to not counting the
number of combinations for the 1.2 allele, are you saying that you
weren't aware of that situation prior to your testimony in the
criminal trial?

A. No.

MR. LAMBERT: Objection, asked and answered.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. As we both know, I did know how to calculate it when I did my two
calculation -- the two-person calculations before going to Los
Angeles. I had been correct.

When I wrote the program in my hotel room in Los Angeles I left out
that extra step.

Q. Now, Dr. Weir, you're familiar with the National Research Counsel
report of 1992, are you not, on Forensic Applications of DNA
Technology.

MR. LAMBERT: Beyond the scope.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BLASIER) You have participated in discussions, written
articles about how to analyze mixed stains for some time now, haven't
you?

A. Not before the criminal trial of course. About a year.

Q. You never dealt with that issue before the criminal trial?

A. Didn't come up until May of '95.

Q. How much are you asking to be paid for your preparation time in
this case?

MR. LAMBERT: Objection, beyond the scope.

MR. BLASIER: Last question.

THE COURT: I'll permit it.

A. Nothing.

MR. BLASIER: Thank you. REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. LAMBERT:

Q. (BY MR. LAMBERT) Dr. Weir, that number that you wrote on the piece
of paper that you gave Mr. Blasier, what was the number?

A. It was 1996. I do know the date on which my own book was published.

Q. Did you provide him a copy of your curriculum vitae that
specifically listed that date and the date it was published?

A. Yes.

Q. He has that?

A. Yes, sir.

MR. LAMBERT: Thank you, Your Honor.

THE COURT: You're excused.

MR. BLASIER: Your Honor, I would like to move in 2232, 2233, 2234, and
2235.

THE COURT: They're received.

THE WITNESS: Yes. Leroy, L-e-r-o-y, Taft, T-a-f-t.

DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q. You are a very close personal friend of O.J. Simpson?

A. I think that's true.

Q. And have been so for 27 years, right?

A. Over the 27 years, the friendship has grown closer.

Q. Also, you are business manager, business advisor to him during this
time?

A. And his personal attorney, that's correct.

Q. And his personal attorney, right.

You picked up Mr. Simpson at the airport on June 13, 1994, right?

A. Correct.

Q. And you drove over to Rockingham, right?

A. Correct.

Q. And a little bit later you went down to Parker Center, right?

A. Correct.

Q. And you were in a room with Mr. Simpson and another lawyer named
Howard Weitzman, right?

A. Correct.

Q. And at that time, you had occasion to observe Mr. Simpson's left
hand, right?

A. Correct.

Q. We're talking, now, about 1 o'clock in the afternoon on June 13,
correct?

A. Correct.

Q. Okay.

And you saw some cuts on Mr. Simpson's left hand, correct?

A. As I sit here today, I recall one cut, Mr. Petrocelli.

Q. In fact, you saw more than one cut, correct?

A. No. I say, as I sit here today, I recall seeing one cut and -- and
early in my deposition that's what I said.

Q. You said something else in your deposition, which we will get to in
a minute.

MR. BAKER: I move to strike the gratuitous preamble from Mr.
Petrocelli's --

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Let me show you this photograph, Mr. Taft, of a
picture of Mr. Simpson's fourth finger on his left hand.

(Indicating to photo.)

Q. Do you see that?

A. Yes.

Q. And do you see the cut on that finger, sir?

A. Yes.

Q. And you saw that cut at 1 o'clock p.m. on June 13, 1994, true?

A. No, not true.

MR. PETROCELLI: Okay. Put it up on the Elmo.

THE COURT REPORTER: The number again, please.

MR. FOSTER: 548.

(Exhibit 548 displayed on Elmo.)

Q. When I took your deposition, that was August, 1996, right?

A. That's correct.

Q. And you understood you were under oath and had to tell the truth,
right?

A. Absolutely.

Q. You're a lawyer and you understand the obligation to tell the
truth?

A. Absolutely.

Q. And have you had a chance to speak to Mr. Simpson, or any of his
lawyers, before coming here today?

MR. BAKER: That would be -- he's one of Mr. Simpson's lawyers. That's
privileged.

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) About your testimony, about what you might be
asked on the witness stand?

MR. BAKER: Anything?

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. PETROCELLI: Okay. Now, let me -- let me put this on the -- well,
no leave this on the Elmo.

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Let me read to you from your deposition.

MR. PETROCELLI: Mr. Baker, page 132.

MR. BAKER: Got it.

MR. PETROCELLI: Starting at line 9.

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) (Reading:)

Q. You were present when Mr. Simpson had his wound dressed?

A. I wasn't present when his wound was dressed but I was present when
we talked with him alone, Howard Weitzman and myself.

Q. Is that when --

A. I believe I observed it at that time.

Q. His cuts?

A. Yes.

Q. How many did you observe?

A. Well, that cut -- (Indicating)

Q. Referring to depo Exhibit 38.

A. -- Which I believe is on his -- It's his fourth finger.

Q. Yes.

Fourth finger?

You recall giving all that?

A. I recall that, reading that, yes

MR. PETROCELLI: Page 133 line 1. A. I saw that cut.

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Do you recall giving that testimony?

A. Yes.

MR. BAKER: You better read the whole --

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Do you recall giving that testimony?

A. Yes, I do.

Q. Okay.

Now, in issue to the cut on the fourth finger which you testified
under oath just a couple months ago that you saw, you also said you
saw a cut on his middle finger, true?

A. That's true.

Q. So at your deposition, you said to me under oath, that you saw two
cuts -- at least two cuts, correct?

A. I said in one part of my deposition, that's correct, but --

Q. Okay.

A. Earlier in my deposition when you --

Q. Sir.

A. You asked me that question. May I finish my answer.

Q. No.

MR. BAKER: Your Honor.

MR. PETROCELLI: It's not responsive.

MR. BAKER: He's entitled to finish his answer.

THE COURT: He said yes. Ask another question.

MR. PETROCELLI: Thank you.

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Did you not tell me at page 133, I'll let you
look at it, sir, pages 130, 1, 2 and 3, you can look at it yourself.

Excuse me, Gina.

THE COURT REPORTER: (Nod.)

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Did you not tell me, sir, that you saw at least
two cuts on Mr. Simpson's left hand, one on his fourth and one on his
third, and perhaps a third cut on his third?

A. I didn't say perhaps a third cut. I said I thought I saw two cuts.
But I was referring to the pictures that you were showing me.

Q. And I showed you a picture of that finger with the fourth cut, the
fourth finger, right?

A. That's correct.

Q. And you looked at it, at the deposition, right?

A. Yes.

Q. And you said that you saw that cut, correct?

A. Yeah, but I saw --

Q. Yes or no?

A. I saw it on the picture, Mr. Petrocelli. I saw it on the picture.
Earlier I said I saw one cut.

Q. Excuse me. Excuse me, sir.

A. I think on page 118 and 119.

Q. You've really read this, haven't you?

A. Of course.

Q. Of course.

A. Of course. Take a look at 118 and 119.

Q. Excuse me, sir, at no time did you ever tell me at 20 pages later
133, wait a second Mr. Petrocelli, I only saw one cut. You never said
that, correct?

MR. BAKER: Argumentative.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. No, I never said those words.

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) How about this, Mr. Taft. (Reading:)

Q. So you saw a total of three cuts at Parker Center on June 13, on
Mr. Simpson, on the fingers of his left hand, right?

A. I saw for sure two. I'm not sure of that third cut that you pointed
out in that picture.

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) How about that, Mr. Taft?

MR. BAKER: Wait a minute.

MR. PETROCELLI: Put that on the Elmo.

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, what is this "how about that." That's not a
question. If he wants to argue the case, he ought to wait until the
end of the case to argue.

MR. PETROCELLI: Put that on the Elmo.

THE COURT: Just a minute, counsel. You will not argue with the
witness.

Witness, if you persist in arguing with your questioner, then I will
permit that question.

Do you understand me?

THE WITNESS: Yes, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Okay.

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Let's take a look at this. (Reading:) I saw
that cut and I saw that on the left hand.

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Do you see that?

MR. PETROCELLI: Now, go up to where I just read. Keep going.

(Indicating to Elmo.)

MR. PETROCELLI: Keep going. Keep going. Keep going.

Can you not find it, Steve? (Indicating to Elmo.)

MR. PETROCELLI: Right here, right there.

(Indicating to transcript. Assisting Mr. Foster at Elmo.)

Q. Did you give that testimony under oath?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Now, I'd like to you tell the jury -- are you now telling the jury
that that was wrong, now? You saw one cut; is that your testimony
today?

A. No. My testimony today is that I'm sure I saw one cut in -- my best
recollection, any other cut -- I lost my time reference with respect
to Mr. Petrocelli showing me pictures and asking me if I saw them.

I saw those pictures, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, many times
afterwards, in meetings with attorneys.

And you have to realize that on the 13th, we were all in a major state
of shock.

Q. Have you finished?

A. That's my answer.

Q. Okay.

You didn't tell me any of that, did you, sir, when you gave me that
answer: "I saw for sure, two," correct; you didn't tell me?

A. Correct.

Q. You had every word in the universe to choose when you answered my
question, sir, and you said, "I saw for sure two," correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And then you, on your own, said, "I'm not sure of that third cut
that you pointed out in that picture," correct?

A. Correct.

Q. Those are all your words, correct?

I didn't lead you into those answers, did I?

A. Well, you did.

Q. Oh?

A. You did. And I'll tell you where you did. Because if you look
earlier in my deposition --

Q. Okay.

A. -- I said I think I saw one cut, but when you pulled out a set of
pictures, and started showing me other cuts in the picture, the time
reference all came together.

Q. Let me ask you this: Were you in a state of shock at your
deposition?

A. No.

Q. Clear-headed when you gave that testimony?

A. I believe so.

Q. Now, when you -- before coming to this court today, telling this
jury now, that you saw one cut and not two --

A. That's my best recollection.

Q. Excuse me. I'm not finished with my answer [sic].

Before coming here and taking that witness stand and telling this jury
that you saw one cut and not two, you understood the importance of
saying that Mr. Simpson only had one cut on his finger at that time;
true or untrue?

A. I understood the importance.

Q. Just answer --

A. The importance of telling the truth here today.

Q. Excuse me, Mr. Taft.

MR. PETROCELLI: Your Honor, could you direct him to answer my
questions?

THE COURT: Answer the question, counsel.

A. I understood it was correct to tell the truth today.

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Now, you want to answer my question? Let's try
it a third time.

A. Please repeat the question.

Q. Okay.

You understood the importance to Mr. Simpson's side of the case, in
saying that there was only one cut, not two, on his finger, correct?

You understood that?

A. I understood that I was here to tell my best recollection of the
situation.

THE COURT: Excuse me, Mr. Taft. I'm going to direct you just one more
time to answer the question.

THE WITNESS: I can't answer the question the way you've put the
question. You're --

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) You also understood, by the way, how important
it was to tell the truth at your deposition, right?

Yes or no?

A. Yes.

Q. You -- you understood before you took the witness stand, and turned
to the jury, and told them that you only saw one cut instead of the
two, that you said at the deposition, that Mr. Simpson had testified
before this same jury that there was only the one cut on his finger.
You knew that, didn't you?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Of course you did.

And you knew that Mr. Simpson, on that same witness stand where you
are sitting, denied having that cut on his fourth finger, that you
said he had in August, true?

A. True.

MR. PETROCELLI: I've got nothing further.

THE COURT: Cross-examine.

CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. BAKER:

Q. You knew before either your deposition or your testimony, that the
LAPD, on June 13, had looked at both of his hands, because he was a
murder suspect, and inspected them completely, and found one cut on
the middle knuckle of his hand.

MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. Lacks foundation. Calls for hearsay, no
testimony.

A. That's correct.

MR. BAKER: That door has been opened.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You knew that the police, after 1:30, when they had
taken his statement, go down to dress his hands, had inspected both of
his hands, forwards, backwards, upwards, downwards, and taken a
picture of the only cut he had, the cut on the middle knuckle of his
left hand, did you not, sir?

MR. PETROCELLI: Excuse me. There's no foundation. Secondly, it's all
leading.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Tell us what you knew about what the police
inspected on June 13, 1994, after they had taken blood from Mr.
Simpson.

MR. PETROCELLI: Excuse me. That calls for speculation upon
speculation, about what the police knew.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. PETROCELLI: And so forth.

MR. BAKER: That is the same question asked again. Did he know.

THE COURT: I don't think so.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Did you know what the police inspected relative to
looking for cuts on Mr. Simpson's hands, before you testified in your
deposition in August of '96, and before you took the witness stand?

A. Yes.

Q. What did you know?

A. I knew that the police inspected his hand and found one cut on the
left hand, middle finger knuckle.

Q. And you've testified in your deposition at page 118, before Mr.
Simpson -- Mr. Simpson -- I'm sorry -- Mr. Petrocelli had given you
any pictures, about your recollections relative to cuts on his hand,
did you not?

A. Yes.

MR. PETROCELLI: Excuse me, Mr. Baker. Can you give me a page?

MR. BAKER: I apologize.

MR. PETROCELLI: That's all right. Give me a line.

MR. P. BAKER: 118, line 16.

MR. PETROCELLI: 118 what?

MR. BAKER: 16.

MR. PETROCELLI: Thank you.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You're talking about the cuts Mr. Simpson had that
you observed when you were asked this in your deposition, before he
had given you any pictures, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And you said after the question was, when Mr. Simpson entered your
car, did he have a cut in -- anywhere on his body.

Your answer was, I think he had. I don't know which hand it was, but
he had -- it's one of his -- it was either his middle -- his middle
finger, (indicating) I think on one hand, he had a cut.

That's what you testified, to correct?

A. Correct.

Q. Now, Mr. Taft, when you picked up Mr. Simpson at the airport on
June 13, 1994, were you in a period of emotional shock and grief?

A. Completely.

Q. Was Mr. Simpson's demeanor one of emotional shock and grief?

MR. PETROCELLI: Excuse me, Your Honor. This is leading and it's beyond
the scope.

THE COURT: Sustained as leading.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) What was Mr. Simpson's demeanor when you picked him
up at -- at -- in the -- I guess it would be the morning, local time
-- what was his demeanor in the car and -- when you got him into the
vehicle and headed back to Rockingham?

A. He was in a complete state of shock.

MR. PETROCELLI: That calls for speculation, Your Honor. I move to
strike it as self-serving.

THE COURT: Denied.

Mr. Baker, if you're going to proceed in this line, he's not coming
back as a defense witness, okay? Make up your mind.

I don't want a double shot at him. This is the end of plaintiffs'
case, and I'm giving you some latitude, as you've noticed in the last
few days, so we can avoid having witnesses come back.

If you want to examine him further on that area, which is clearly
beyond the scope, then you have to call him back. Unless you're not
going to call him back.

MR. BAKER: You made your point.

THE COURT: Okay.

MR. BAKER: I have no further questions at this time.

THE COURT: Thank you.

REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q. Let's go back to the testimony at 118, that you apparently had
memorized before coming to the courtroom.

By the way, how much time did you spend with the lawyers talking about
the cut issue?

MR. BAKER: I object, Your Honor. Attorney-client privilege.

MR. PETROCELLI: He opened the door by getting back into this, Your
Honor, showed him the deposition and everything.

MR. BAKER: That doesn't waive the privilege.

MR. PETROCELLI: Asked him how much time --

MR. BAKER: Doesn't waive the privilege.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. PETROCELLI: He is not his lawyer.

THE COURT: Claimed he is.

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Is Mr. Baker your attorney?

THE COURT: No. He claimed he is Mr. Simpson's attorney.

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) I'm asking you about conversations with the
defense team here.

MR. PETROCELLI: I want to know about those conversations, Your Honor.
I'm not asking about conversations between --

THE COURT: I'll sustain the objection.

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) How long of a time did you spend, without
telling me what was said?

MR. BAKER: I want to approach if we're going to continue this.

MR. PETROCELLI: That doesn't call for any communication --

MR. BAKER: I want to approach.

THE COURT: Excuse me. I'm sustaining the objections.

MR. PETROCELLI: 118, page 118.

MR. FOSTER: Line --

MR. PETROCELLI: What was it, line 6?

MR. P. BAKER: 16.

MR. BAKER: Starts at 16.

(Transcript displayed on Elmo Screen.)

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Now, was this the testimony that you were
relying on to support your statement that you talked about a single
cut.

MR. BAKER: Argumentative and form.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Is that the testimony that you were relying on
when you told the jury how you had testified that there was only one
cut on Mr. Simpson's finger that you observed on June 13? Is that it?

A. That and a little further down, Mr. Petrocelli.

Q. Okay.

You want to show us?

A. Yes. I'd like you to see at the bottom of page 18, and the first of
19 -- 119.

Q. That's 119.

I want you to point to all the words, sir, that you're relying on.

A. I don't -- I don't see it there.

In one place, around page 118, 119, I say I'm not even sure that I saw
the first cut. And -- and it's only on my recollection that I believe
I saw one cut.

MR. PETROCELLI: You want to help me, Mr. Baker? You know where that is
in the deposition.

MR. BAKER: You want to cross-examine me?

MR. PETROCELLI: No. You have a depo cite we can show him?

MR. BAKER: Look, Mr. Petrocelli, so interested, at page 119.

THE COURT: Excuse me. I don't think that's appropriate now.

If you want to show --

MR. BAKER: If --

THE COURT: Excuse me. Can I run the trial?

MR. PETROCELLI: Trying to find the spot.

THE COURT: If you want to show him the transcript, show him the
transcript, Mr. Petrocelli. Don't look to Mr. Baker to do that.

MR. PETROCELLI: Here.

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) I'll show you the transcript. I want to make
sure we have everything that you've relied on, sir.

(Witness reviews transcript.)

A. It's at the bottom of 119, and I guess the top of page 20, line 25
at the bottom of 19 -- 119 and line 1 of -- top of 20.

Q. So -- well, let me read this.

Q. Starting at page 118, line 16:

When Mr. Simpson entered your car, did he have a cut anywhere on his
body?

A. I think he had. I don't know which hand it was, but he had -- it's
one of his -- it was either his middle -- it was his middle finger,
(indicating). I think on one hand he had a cut.

Was he bleeding in the car?

No.

Did he have a bandage on?

I believe so.

Did you see any blood in the car?

In my car?

Yes.

No.

Did you see any blood oozing through the bandage on his finger?

I don't know.

How did you know he had a cut on his finger?

I learned later, because O.J. and I went down with Howard Weitzman to
Parker Center, and I know that he -- they wanted to take blood from
him at that time, and they may have asked questions about that finger,
because he may have had it redressed there by the nurse.

Prior to that time, though, when you were picking him up at the
airport --

MR. BAKER: Wait a minute. If you're going to read it, read it
correctly. Read where the word "indicating" is and where I indicate
that he was indicating the middle finger of his --

MR. PETROCELLI: Reading question -- and I'll be happy to read your
comment prior to that time, Mr. Baker.

(Reading:)

MR. BAKER: Indicating the middle finger of the left hand.

MR. BAKER: He indicated in his answer you know it -- it's right here
on line 16.

MR. PETROCELLI: I'm reading what he said.

MR. BAKER: Read the --

THE COURT: Let him read the transcript.

MR. BAKER: He has to read it accurately.

THE COURT: Mr. Baker, the transcript is the transcript. Now read it.

MR. PETROCELLI: (Reading:)

Q. Now, when you were picking him up at the airport and going to
Rockingham, did you know that he had a cut on his finger?

A. I consciously, at this point, don't know that I knew.

Q. Did he change his bandage in the car?

No.

What kind of bandage was it on his finger?

Just a band-aid.

Just a regular band-aid?

As far as I know, it was just a regular band-aid.

What was he wearing?

You meaning his clothes?

Yeah.

It was a white golf shirt.

MR. BAKER: I object, Your Honor. This is beyond the scope.

MR. PETROCELLI: I'm going to page 120, where he asked --

THE COURT: Overruled. Go ahead.

MR. BAKER: He isn't going to 120.

MR. PETROCELLI: Where would you like me to stop, sir?

THE WITNESS: I think --

(Witness reviews transcript.)

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) I was --

A. I was -- I was mentioning this sentence here, that I consciously
didn't remember.

Q. Have we gone past the point?

A. Yes.

Q. Can I stop reading now?

A. Yes, you may.

Q. Okay.

Now, when you were questioned by me about that subject matter, we were
referring to the time when Mr. Simpson got in your car from the
airport, and you drove him to Rockingham, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And at that time, as you testified, he had a band-aid on, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And you --

A. My best recollection.

Q. Excuse me?

A. Well --

Q. He had a band-aid on, correct?

A. To my best recollection.

Q. And you testified under oath at your deposition, that you did not
consciously know at that time, whether he had any cuts, correct?

A. Other than the one I said I thought I saw under the band-aid, or
that I was aware -- he didn't wear a band-aid unless he had a cut.

Q. Sir, you never said in your deposition that you saw a cut under his
band-aid, did you?

A. No.

Q. And, in fact, you were testifying under oath, that when you did
learn about the cut, was later on, when you were at Parker Center with
Howard Weitzman and Mr. Simpson and you, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. And isn't it -- isn't it the truth, sir, that the first time that
you really learned about a cut or cuts on Mr. Simpson's finger, and
could see cuts or a cut, was at the room in Parker Center with Mr.
Weitzman, yourself, and Mr. Simpson, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And what you were saying under oath in your deposition was that, in
the car ride, because Mr. Simpson had a band-aid, you did not
consciously see any cuts at that time, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. So the only place where you actually observed a cut or cuts on Mr.
Simpson's hand is at Parker Center, 1 clock p.m., on June 13, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And that is where we started this examination some time ago,
correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And furthermore, you knew, Mr. Taft, when you completed this
deposition, that you had the right to review it, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. You also knew, Mr. Taft, when you received this deposition, that
you had the right, the absolute right, to make any changes at the time
that you reviewed it, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And you did not do so, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And the truth of the matter is, Mr. Taft, that you saw a cut on Mr.
Simpson's middle finger in that room, correct?

MR. BAKER: What room?

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) In the room at Parker Center with Mr. Weitzman
and yourself and Mr. Simpson. Correct?

A. I saw a cut on his middle finger.

Q. Correct?

A. Is that -- is that the question?

Q. That is a question.

A. Yes.

Q. And you also saw the cut on his fourth finger, did you not?

A. No, that's not correct.

Q. You deny that under oath?

A. Yes, I do.

Q. Let's take one more like look.

MR. BAKER: Object. This is asked and answered.

MR. PETROCELLI: Look, let me read it. It's a little easier.

MR. BAKER: It's asked and answered.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) I'm going to read you the whole line. It's
about a page, page and a half.

Where's Exhibit 38?

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, we've been through this on direct.

MR. PETROCELLI: We haven't been through this before.

Depo 38. Put Depo Exhibit 38, which is the same one we put on the
deposition. Keep it up on the monitor.

It's at page 131, line 23, Mr. Baker.

(Reading:)

I have a better picture of Exhibit 30, the cut on the side of the
finger. That's Exhibit 38.

Are you with me now, sir? That's Exhibit 38 at the deposition.

(Reading:)

MR. BAKER: Don't guess or speculate if you've seen that before, Mr.
Petrocelli.

Q. You said at Parker Center. A. Yeah, I believe I saw that

cut at Parker Center. Q. You recall giving that

answer while you were looking at that

picture, at the deposition? A. Correct. Q. On what day, A. The 13th.
Q. You were present when

Mr. Simpson had his wound dressed? A. I wasn't present when his

wound was dressed, but I was present

when we talked about it with him alone.

He, Howard Weitzman, and myself. Q. Is that when -- A. I believe I
observed it at

that time. Q. His cuts? A. Yes. Q. How many did you observe? A. Well
that cut (indicating). Q. Referring to depo

Exhibit 38. A. Which I believe is on

his -- it's his fourth finger. Q. Yes. A. Fourth finger. Q. Correct.
A. I saw that cut and I saw

the -- on the left hand, correct.

And then this is your answer:

(Reading:)

And then I saw the cut on his

knuckle, on his left knuckle.

Do you recall giving that testimony?

A. Yeah.

Q. So, sir, after telling me you saw the cut on the fourth finger, you
pointed out to me that you saw the cut on the knuckle of his third
finger, correct?

A. Whatever the deposition says.

Q. Is that correct?

A. Whatever the deposition says.

Q. Is that what you did? You told me, and then you saw the cut on the
knuckle of the third finger, true?

A. But I was referring to the picture.

Q. True, sir?

A. I was not referring to the June 13 physical inspection where I saw
one cut.

Q. Excuse me, sir. Is that a knuckle right there?

A. I don't believe so.

Q. Okay.

So when you told me in your deposition about -- when you said, and
then I saw the cut on his knuckle, on his left knuckle, you then were
directing me to his middle finger, to a different cut, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And, in fact, I then showed you a picture of it, right?

MR. PETROCELLI: Let's put on depo Exhibit 31.

(Deposition Exhibit 547 displayed on the Elmo Screen.),

MR. PETROCELLI: (Reading:) Q. Let me show you that cut.

That's depo Exhibit 31; is that right. A. Yes. Q. And you see a cut
above

the knuckle? A. Yes. Q. And then one a little bit

lower than that, right? A. Right. Q. How did Mr. Simpson tell

you --

MR. PETROCELLI: Excuse me. Question: Now, did Mr. Simpson

tell you how he got those cuts? MR. BAKER: At the time or later?

Then there's some objections which I won't repeat for the record. Is
that okay, Mr. Baker?

(Continued reading as follows:)

MR. PETROCELLI: Picking up at line 5 at 134. Q. So you saw a total of
three

cuts at Parker Center on June 13 on

Mr. Simpson, on the fingers of his left

hand. Right? A. I saw for sure two. I'm

not sure of that third cut that you

pointed out in that picture. Q. The third cut you are

referring to is the one at the top of

the ring finger? A. Yeah. I don't have any clear

consciousness of that cut as I do of the

one on the fourth finger, and the one on

his middle finger knuckle.

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Do you recall giving that testimony under oath,
sir?

A. Yes.

Q. Do you recall it is true, as you testified under oath, that you had
a clear consciousness on June 13 of the cut on the fourth finger and
the cut on the middle finger, true?

A. I didn't have a clear consciousness of it on the 13th.

Q. So you lied to me in your deposition?

A. No, I didn't lie to you.

MR. BAKER: That's argumentative.

MR. PETROCELLI: I have no deposition records.

THE CLERK: For the record, what's the number

MR. FOSTER: 549.

MR. BAKER: Leave that up there.

RECROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. BAKER:

Q. Now, that 549 was taken on the 15th.

Do you know if it was taken on June 15?

A. I don't know.

Q. Do you know when the photos were taken that you subsequently
reviewed in meetings with attorneys relative to the defense of Mr.
Simpson in the criminal case?

A. I believe it was the week of the 13th through the 17th.

Q. And by the way, when you were there on the 13th with Mr. Simpson,
and you and Howard Weitzman had gone down --

MR. PETROCELLI: He's opening the door that was forbidden into
inquiring, Your Honor, last two questions.

THE COURT: Well --

MR. BAKER: I'm not asking --

THE COURT: I'll just caution counsel --

MR. BAKER: That's nonsense.

THE COURT: -- that nobody has been turned -- it hasn't been opened. If
it opens, it opens.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Did Mr. Simpson have a band-aid on the fourth finger
of his left hand when you were in Parker Center on June 13, 1994 Mr.
Taft?

A. No.

Q. And he had a band-aid on the middle finger of his left hand or over
the knuckle; is that correct?

A. That's my best recollection.

Q. And your recollection relative to the cuts that he had that day --
strike that.

Were you attempting to find out what cuts he had on his hands?

A. Absolutely not.

Q. Nothing further.

MR. PETROCELLI: I have nothing further for this witness.

THE CLERK: I don't think that's the right exhibit number.

MR. PETROCELLI: By the way, we're moving in Exhibits 548 and 549.

THE COURT: Hold on.

THE CLERK: What number?

MR. FOSTER: 547.

THE CLERK: Last exhibit is 547.

MR. PETROCELLI: We were moving in exhibits 547 and 548.

THE COURT: Received.

(The instrument previously marked as Plaintiffs' Exhibit 547 was
received in evidence.)

(The instrument previously marked as Plaintiffs' Exhibit 548 was
received in evidence.)

MR. PETROCELLI: Your Honor, at this time we'd like to read in
deposition testimony of Robert Kardashian.

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, we're going to have to have a hearing on that.

THE COURT: All right. Let's have a hearing.

How long is it?

MR. PETROCELLI: The readings -- I'd say my readings are ten minutes.

THE COURT: Okay.

Jurors, I'm going to excuse you for lunch until 1:30.

Don't talk about the case; don't form or express any opinions.

(Jurors exit courtroom.)

(The following proceedings were held in open court, outside the
presence of the jury.)

MR. BAKER: I was reading Mr. Kelly's declaration, Your Honor, and they
have not proved unavailability; they've never attempted to serve him
with subpoena, and he's not unavailable under the code; and therefore,
I would object to them reading his deposition. Serve him with a
subpoena, and they can bring him into court and have him testify.

MR. PETROCELLI: He's in New York, Your Honor. He's -- you know, I
mean, Mr. Kelly had a dialogue with the lawyer. He fully expected them
to cooperate.

At the last minute, when he's out of town, they pull the plug.

And this is deposition testimony that all lawyers have been there;
he's been fully examined. They gave me counter-designations already
that they want to read back.

It's like a 15-minute, 20-minute witness, Your Honor and the guy is in
New York. He's on TV.

MR. BAKER: Your Honor --

MR. PETROCELLI: He's on TV, talking.

MR. BAKER: I'll trade one Kardashian for one Fuhrman.

(Laughter.)

MR. BAKER: It's just a technicality. You know, everybody was there.
They know all about his trial testimony.

MR. PETROCELLI: He is unavailable. He's in the State of New York, and
he is unavailable.

MR. BAKER: He could have been subpoenaed anytime from September 17 to
yesterday.

THE COURT: Nice try, Mr. Baker.

You may read it.

MR. PETROCELLI: Thank you.

THE COURT: I find him to be unavailable. He's in New York.

Okay. 1:30.

THE BAILIFF: We are in recess. 1:30.

Doors open at 1:15.

(At 11:40 A.M., a luncheon recess was taken, until 1:30 P.M. of the
same day.)

MR. PETROCELLI: By deposition, we call Robert Kardashian.

Mr. Kardashian's deposition was taken in May 1996. We'll be reading
from certain portions of it.

(Selected portions of the deposition of Robert Kardashian, taken in
May 1996, were read into the record, Mr. Petrocelli reading the
questions, and Mr. Gelblum reading the answers.)

MR. PETROCELLI: Starting at page 85, lines 14, 15, and then picking up
again at line 23.

Okay. (Reading:)

Q. When did you first meet Mr. Simpson?

A. 1970.

MR. PETROCELLI: Down to line 23. (Reading:)

Q. After that first meeting of Mr. Simpson, did you develop a
relationship with him?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. You became close friends to him?

A. Yes.

Q. And did you see him and socialize with him, in addition to
providing or having business interests with him, from the early 70s
onward?

A. Yes.

MR. PETROCELLI: Okay. Page 90, line 21. (Reading:)

Q. Did you share -- did Mr. Simpson live with you at some point prior
to his getting married to Nicole?

A. Yes, he did.

MR. PETROCELLI: Now, moving over to page 245, beginning at line 6.

Wait a second.

For context, we're at Mr. Simpson's office in Brentwood on June 14.

(Reading:)

Q. Can you tell me what the substance of the conversation you had with
Mr. Taft at this time at the office was?

A. Sure.

Q. Okay.

A. Let's call Robert Shapiro.

Q. Short conversation?

A. Pretty much. I mean, that was the essence of it. All I know is, we
picked up the phone and called Shapiro.

MR. PETROCELLI: Now, going over to page 249 at line 8. (Reading:)

Q. And what happened next, after you had this conversation with
Shapiro about reactivating your license?

A. Mr. Shapiro left and we had telephoned A.C. I believe O.J. did; I
don't think I did; I think he did.

Q. Can you speak up a little, Mr. Kardashian; it's hard to hear you.

A. I'm sorry.

Mr. Simpson telephoned Mr. Cowlings and -- 'cause Mr. Cowlings was to
bring his children to my house, and he asked Mr. Cowlings, you know,
when would he be up to my house. And Mr. Cowlings had indicated he
hadn't left yet, but he would be there in about an hour, hour and a
half, something to that effect.

Q. And after that phone call was made, what happened after that?

A. Mr. Simpson, either he or Mr. Taft called Hertz to find out about
his golf clubs -- I believe Mr. Simpson did -- and got the individual,
whose name I don't know, on the phone and asked him about where his
golf clubs were.

Q. Did you see Mr. Simpson writing things down as he made that phone
call?

A. I don't recall.

Q. Do you recall anything else Mr. Simpson said while he was on the
phone?

A. No, no.

Q. Okay.

Did he make any other phone calls after that?

A. I don't think so.

Q. What happened next?

A. O.J. asked me if I would drive him to the airport to get his golf
clubs and --

Q. And what did you say?

A. And I said, sure.

He said -- you know, so we drove to --

Q. Okay. Okay.

Anything else before you left the office?

A. I don't think so.

Q. Did you say anything to Skip Taft when you were leaving?

A. I'm sure -- I don't recall, but I would imagine we told Skip where
we were going, and then we would be at my house after that.

Q. Where did you tell Skip Taft you were going?

A. To the airport, to get O.J.'s golf clubs.

Q. Did you hear Simpson say anything to Taft?

A. I -- again, I'm sure Simpson is the one who said it to him and not
me, I would imagine, but I don't know for sure.

Q. Did Skip Taft display any reaction to the statement that you were
going to the airport to get the golf clubs?

A. Not that I recall, no.

Q. Okay. What happened next?

A. We went to American Airlines -- I think it was American.

Q. You drove the Rolls Royce?

A. Yes, drove the Rolls Royce.

Q. You and Mr. Simpson?

A. Yes.

MR. PETROCELLI: Skipping down to line 23 on page 252.

(Reading:)

Q. Did you have any conversation on the way to the airport?

A. Yes.

Q. Can you relate to me any of the substance of that conversation you
had on the way to the airport?

A. I really don't remember much of the conversation.

Q. Do you recall any part of the conversation being about Mr. Simpson
playing golf?

A. No.

Q. Do you remember any part of the conversation being about why Mr.
Simpson needed his golf clubs?

A. No.

Q. Do you recall any part of the conversation being that Mr. Simpson
had golf plans the next few days?

A. No.

Q. Any -- well, do you recall any part of the conversation being about
Nicole?

A. I just don't remember. I couldn't answer it. I don't recall.

Q. No recollection as to the substance of the conversation?

A. I don't know what we talked about.

Q. How long of a drive is it from Rockingham to the airport?

A. Well, we were at Skip's office --

Q. Yeah.

A. -- so --

Q. How long a drive was it that morning when you went to the airport?

A. About 20 minutes.

Q. And you have no recollection of any of the conversation?

A. No, I do not.

Q. Could you describe Mr. Simpson's general demeanor during that drive
to the airport?

A. He was very -- I just took it that he was pretty much in shock the
whole week. He wasn't the way he was previously.

Q. I'm asking specifically on the drive to the airport, could you
describe his demeanor to me?

A. He was pensive. He was quiet, which is unlike him.

Q. Do you recall him even speaking at all on the way?

A. I --

Q. Let me finish the question.

A. I'm sorry.

Q. Do you recall Mr. Simpson even speaking at all from the time you
left the office till the time you arrived at the airport?

A. I don't know.

Q. And did you go to the arrivals or departures of American Airlines?

A. Down below. I can't recall if it -- it would be -- arrivals, I
believe, is down below.

Q. What, if anything, happened next?

A. We got out of the car.

Q. Both of you?

A. Yes.

Q. Did you park curbside?

A. Yes.

Q. In the no-parking zone?

A. Yes.

And we went to the baggage -- there's a baggage claim window for
luggage that's been left there -- I don't know what it's called -- and
we went to that window and asked.

Q. You say "we." Did you or did Mr. Simpson?

A. I believe -- I believe he did. I believe he did.

MR. PETROCELLI: Down to page 18 -- excuse me, line 18 -- actually, 19.

(Reading:)

Q. What happened next, after you went to the window?

A. He asked where his golf clubs were or where the luggage would be
from a certain flight number. And I remember the lady told us where it
was, which was -- I don't recall, but it was the next carousel over,
the next section over, something like that. Then we turned and we
walked over there.

Q. And did you observe Mr. Simpson's golf clubs somewhere?

A. Yes.

Q. And where were they?

A. They were -- actually an attendant was there, and if I'm not
mistaken, he picked them up, and Mr. Simpson then took them and we put
them in the trunk of my Rolls Royce.

Q. Did the attendant just pick them up and hand them to Mr. Simpson?

A. Yes.

Q. Did the attendant carry them any distance at all, or did he just
turn around and hand them directly to Mr. Simpson?

A. My recollection is, he just handed them to him.

Q. Did Mr. Simpson submit any claim check or any sort of ticket to the
attendant before taking the clubs?

A. No.

MR. PETROCELLI: Down to line 24 and the next page. (Reading:)

Q. Where did he place it in your car?

A. In my trunk.

Q. And what happened next?

A. We drove to my house.

Q. Directly?

A. Directly, yes.

Q. Had you done any other driving with Mr. Simpson that morning, other
than from Rockingham to the San Vicente office, and then San Vicente
to the airport?

A. I don't believe so. No, I don't think so.

Q. Any discussion of going anywhere other than to the office and then
to the airport?

A. I don't think so. I think he just said, let's go get my golf clubs.

MR. PETROCELLI: Okay. Now going to page 263, line 2. (Reading:)

Q. When was it -- did you ever see Mr. Simpson's golf bag again after
you pulled into your residence on June 14? A. Yeah.

Q. When was that?

A. I saw it every day.

Q. Well, did you remove it?

A. I saw it the next day.

Q. Did you take it out of your trunk that day when you arrived there?

A. Either I -- I think I did. Either I did or my housekeeper did, one
of the two.

Q. Do you know where that golf bag was placed?

A. Yes. It was placed in my garage.

Q. Do you recall placing it in there yourself?

A. I don't recall. But my pattern is, I would have probably placed it
there myself.

Q. Did you leave it in that travel bag it was in?

A. Yes.

Q. Did you ever open that travel bag?

A. That day?

Q. First of all, that day.

A. No.

Q. Did you open it any of the days following that?

A. Yes.

Q. What day?

A. Oh, I don't know. It would have been maybe a week after he was
arrested. I don't know when, but after his arrest.

Q. Did you ever see Mr. Simpson touch that golf bag after you arrived
at your residence that day?

A. Yes.

Q. When was that?

A. I don't know, it was either -- I think it was Wednesday evening.

Q. What, if anything, did you observe him do with the golf bag?

A. I saw him take a golf club out.

Q. Was the travel bag still on the bag?

A. Yes.

Q. You saw him open the travel bag --

A. Yes.

Q. -- correct?

Did you see him lift the golf bag out of the travel bag?

A. No.

Q. Just peel the travel bag down?

A. Yes.

Q. And removed one club?

A. Yes.

Q. You know which club he removed?

A. No, I do not.

Q. What did he do with the club?

A. It was an iron.

Q. Okay.

A. He went for a walk and he was swinging the golf club.

Q. Did you walk out to the garage with him when he went to get the
golf club?

A. Yes.

Q. Did he tell you he was going to the garage to get a golf club?

A. No, he -- no.

Q. No?

A. No.

Q. Were you having a conversation with him as he walked to the golf
bag -- as he walked to the golf bag in the garage?

A. He said, I'm going to go for a walk.

Q. And did he ask you to go with him?

A. No.

Q. Did he ask you to follow him to the garage?

A. No.

MR. PETROCELLI: The last page, 595, at line 24. (Reading:)

Q. Now, when you left the office and went to get the golf clubs, your
plan was to get the golf clubs and then head to your home in Encino,
true?

A. Correct.

Q. And he, referring to Mr. Simpson, requested that you go to the
airport to get the golf clubs, is that true?

A. Yes.

Q. And if you left the office and went to your home, you would have
gone north, is that true?

A. South.

Q. Your home is south of the office?

A. Oh, I'm sorry, no, I didn't go home, I went to the airport.

Q. I understand that.

If you didn't go to the airport, you went directly from your office to
your home --

A. I'm sorry?

Q. -- would you go north? Is that correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. From his office.

And in order for you to go to the airport, you had to go south first,
correct?

A. That's right.

Q. Completely the opposite direction of your house, right?

A. Yes.

MR. PETROCELLI: 597, line 17.

(Reading:)

Q. But you thought that was somewhat of an odd request, didn't you,
that someone who's wife had been killed 36 hours earlier wanted to go
to an airport to pick up golf clubs; isn't that true?

MR. BAKER: Objection, irrelevant, vague.

THE COURT: Overruled.

MR. PETROCELLI: (Reading:)

A. Yes.

Q. And did you question at all, Mr. Simpson, at this point, with
respect to whether there was something in that golf bag that he wanted
to get?

MR. PETROCELLI: Let me -- there are some objections. Let me skip down
to line 11, Mr. Baker, okay?

MR. BAKER: Okay.

MR. PETROCELLI: And my question is:

(Reading:)

Q. Given the oddity of that request, is there anything that you asked
him about -- relative to whether he needed something from the golf
bag?

MR. PETROCELLI: Another objection.

Another question.

MR. BAKER: I move to strike that.

MR. PETROCELLI: I thought there was an answer. There's another
objection. So I'll go to the next question. (Reading:)

Q. Did you ask him why he wanted to go to the airport to get the golf
clubs?

A. No.

Q. Was there any discussion about his motivation behind going to the
airport to get the golf clubs?

A. No.

Q. Did you suggest to him that he could have them delivered?

A. No.

MR. PETROCELLI: No further questions.

MR. P. BAKER: Page 201, line 13.

(Reading:)

Q. You indicated earlier that you -- there was a very noticeable
swollen knuckle and cut on Mr. Simpson's left middle finger?

A. Yes.

MR. P. BAKER: Page 208, line 21.

(Reading:)

Q. Did you observe any other cuts on any other fingers of that left
hand?

A. No, I did not.

Q. Any abrasions?

A. No.

MR. B. BAKER: Page 435, line 3.

(Reading:)

Q. Did you see -- how many cuts did you see?

A. I just saw that -- the cut on the top of his middle finger on his
left hand.

Q. And how long was that cut?

A. I'm not good at this. Maybe -- maybe a half inch, maybe a quarter.
I -- it covered -- it went past his knuckle, so I guess maybe half an
inch.

MR. P. BAKER: Page 436, line 14. (Reading:)

Q. Is the only mark or cut or injury, bruise, abrasion that you saw on
Mr. Simpson before noon on the 14th, that single cut on his middle
finger?

A. Yes, sir.

MR. P. BAKER: Then we're going to go to your section.

Do you have the -- we're going to need the bigger deposition.

452, line 4.

MR. PETROCELLI: Okay.

MR. P. BAKER: We're going to need your copy.

MR. PETROCELLI: Oh, okay, give it to him.

MR. P. BAKER: 452, line 4.

(Reading:)

Q. Okay. And during the week that Mr. Simpson was at your house before
his arrest, you only saw him go to that golf bag on one occasion; is
that right?

A. That's correct.

Q. When he took out that iron, right?

A. Yes.

Q. And you saw him return the iron, right?

A. Yes.

Q. And did he close up the golf travel bag?

A. Yes.

Q. Or did he have it peeled open?

A. No, he zipped it up.

Q. Okay. And from that point on, you never saw him touch that bag
again, right?

A. That's correct.

Q. Did the bag remain in the garage where Mr. Simpson left it when he
closed the bag, for the rest of the week?

A. Oh, yes.

MR. P. BAKER: Nothing further.

MR. PETROCELLI: Page 208, again turning back to --

MR. GELBLUM: I need Volume 1, a copy of Volume 1.

MR. PETROCELLI: -- the subject of the cuts. (Reading:)

Q. And did you actually make any effort to look at it, referring to
his hand?

A. No closer than that.

Q. Make a casual observation of it?

A. No.

MR. PETROCELLI: Page 431 -- I'll pass on that.

No further questions, Your Honor.

MR. P. BAKER: Nothing.

MR. BREWER: Your Honor, at this point, Ms. Sharon Rufo, who is a
resident of Missouri, is in Missouri. We've elected to proceed,
through her deposition, with the videotape, the relevant time period
between 1988 to 1994.

And the questions that are asked in the transcript are by Mr. Leonard
from the defense counsel.

Thank you.

(The videotaped deposition of Sharon Rufo, taken on May 30, 1996, was
played in open court.

And transcribed as follows:)

Q. (MR. LEONARD) Did you have any communication of any kind with --
with Ron from the time he left for California until his death?

A. Yes.

Q. Can you tell me how many times you communicated with him?

MR. BREWER: When you say communication, you're talking written or
oral?

MR. LEONARD: Yeah, anything.

MR. BREWER: Okay.

A. Four times.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) When was the first time that you recall, and
again, it's not --

A. No, this --

Q. I would be shocked if you had a date.

A. The -- this I remember, it was --

Q. Okay.

A. It was Mother's Day of 1990.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Oh, okay.

(Excerpt ends.)

(Excerpt begins.)

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Oh, okay. So you -- so Ronnie called --

A. Yes.

Q. -- two days later?

A. Yes.

Q. And I mean, two days after Mother's Day?

A. Yes.

Q. And just relate the discussion you had.

A. Actually, it was -- it was quite nice. We talked for approximately
two -- two to two and a half hours, and he was telling me about his --
how anxious he was to finally get in touch with me. And he was --
indicated to me that he was struggling financially.

Q. Um-hum.

A. And that he was taking a -- or had completed taking a written exam
for the LA Police Department.

And he told me he had cut his hair and it was -- 'cause he always had
a cowlick and now he didn't have it, he cut it, you know, sort of like
-- he said like from "GQ" magazine. And he put on some weight. And we
talked about his social life.

And we really didn't get into the past, we were just trying to -- I
was just trying to get as much information out of him as I could
'cause it was a few years that I -- since I had talked to him.

(Excerpt ends.)

(Excerpt begins.)

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Are you prepared to go forward?

A. Yes.

Q. My question was, did you have a discussion with -- with Fred about
his taking the children to California?

A. Yes.

Q. And in general terms, can you relate that discussion?

A. Just that he was -- he had a job promotion and he was taking the
children to California.

Q. And what did you say to him, if anything, about that?

A. Just the fact that it would be a long distance for me to see the
children. That's about it.

Q. Okay.

When you say one of the things you discussed with -- with Ron in this
phone call two days after Mother's Day, was that you were struggling
financially --

A. Yes.

Q. -- do you recall in any detail what you described about that?

A. His exact words were, his life was in a shambles, and he had no
job, and he was trying out for the police department. And, like I
said, about his general appearance.

Q. Is there anything else you recall about that two-and-a-half-hour
discussion?

A. Not really.

Q. Okay.

When was the next time that you had any communication with Ron after
that?

A. Approximately six weeks after, I talked to Ronnie on the phone, I
wrote him a letter. I had -- I hadn't heard from him, so I wrote him a
letter.

Q. Okay.

When you -- during the course of -- let me back up a little bit.

During the course of the conversation with Ron, did you -- did you get
his phone number?

A. I believe I did, yes.

Q. Okay.

And you got his address?

A. Yes.

Q. And did you -- did you give him your phone number -- well,
obviously you had.

A. Yeah.

Q. Stupid question.

So you hadn't heard from -- from Ron for about a six-week period?

A. Right.

Q. Is that -- you were expecting to hear from him?

A. Yes.

Q. Had you made some arrangement with him --

A. Yes.

Q. -- that you would speak to each other?

A. Yes.

Q. Now -- and then you wrote a letter to him?

A. Yes.

Q. Did you attempt to call him during this six-week period?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

And did -- were you able to get through to him?

A. No.

Q. Why not?

MR. BREWER: What do you mean "why not"? I mean obsioulsy he wasn't
there or --

MR. LEONARD: I'm asking. I don't know.

A. He wasn't there.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Okay.

Did he have an answering machine at the time?

A. No. If he did, I didn't know about it. It wasn't working.

Q. Okay.

Was he living -- where was he living? I don't mean the address, but do
you know where -- whether he was living with other people or...

A. He had a roommate.

Q. Okay.

And how many times did you try to call him during that period, do you
remember?

A. Approximately one or two times.

Q. Did you ever -- did you ever reach anyone and leave a message?

A. No.

Q. Okay.

Did you -- other than the LA -- taking the LAPD exam, did Ron mention
anything else to you about employment; in other words, that he was
working or where he was working? And I'm talking about the telephone
conversation.

A. I believe it was for United Cerebral Palsy.

Q. And did he tell you what he was doing?

A. He said that he was -- he would go there and he would dress -- help
dress the -- the patients and bathe them, and take care of them, and
feed them, and that's basically what he said his job was.

Q. Okay.

And you wrote a letter approximately six weeks after Mother's Day of
1990?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

You don't -- did you -- you didn't keep a copy of the letter?

A. No.

Q. Okay.

A. I sent pictures, though.

Q. Excuse me?

A. I sent pictures.

Q. You sent photographs?

A. Yes.

Q. Of yourself?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

And what -- what did you say in the letter, do you recall? I mean
obviously not every word, but as much as you recall.

A. Just the fact that -- what was taking him so long in -- in
responding. He was supposed to send me some pictures of his new hair
cut.

Q. Okay.

A. And I hadn't heard from him so I wrote him a letter, and sent him
pictures of myself, and he wanted pictures of my cat, so I sent him
pictures.

Q. As of two days after Mother's Day of 1990, what photographs, if
any, did you have of Ronnie?

A. I had every photograph that was -- that was sent to my mother. If
there were any photographs, my mother sent them to me.

Q. Well, let me put it to you this way: As of two days after Mother's
Day --

A. Um-hum.

Q. -- Of 1990 --

A. Yes.

Q. Did you have any photographs of Ronnie in your residence?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

Did you have a lot of photographs of him?

A. I had photographs -- yes.

Q. Okay.

And -- well, what was the latest age, if you will, of the photograph?
In other words, was he 14, 15, 16, 20, 25?

MR. BREWER: Time period?

MR. LEONARD: Yeah.

A. In the mid 80's.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Okay.

Anything else you can recall about the content of the letter you sent?

A. Not -- no, not really.

Q. Okay.

Did you -- when was the next communication you had with Ron?

A. I wrote another letter, and that was about a month after this --
after that other one.

Q. Um-hum.

And during that one-month period from when you wrote the first letter
until you wrote the second letter, you didn't hear back from Ronnie?

A. No, I did not.

Q. Okay.

Did you attempt to call him during that period?

A. No.

Q. Okay.

Tell me what -- what you recollect was in the second letter you sent
to Ron?

A. The second letter was a wedding announcement and a picture of my
automobile.

Q. Um-hum.

A. And --

Q. Is that the Monte Carlo?

A. No. I had a Thunderbird.

Q. Okay. Okay.

A. And some pictures of the house.

MR. BREWER: (Inaudible.)

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Excuse me?

A. And some pictures of the house.

Q. Okay.

So contained in the envelope with the letter were some photographs?

A. Yes.

Q. And how about the content of the letter, as much as you can
recollect?

A. I wanted to -- wanted to know why I still hadn't heard from him,
and I was getting concerned, and told him that we tried calling, both
my mother and myself, and the phone number was no longer in service.

Q. Okay.

You testified earlier that you -- that you hadn't tried to call, at
least that's what I understood, in the one-month period between the
two letters.

Do you remember that testimony?

A. I did, I called once and my mother called once.

Q. And what was the result of your call?

A. I testified that I got no -- no one answered when I called.

Q. Okay.

MR. BREWER: You're --

MR. LEONARD: Right, no, I think I --

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) You wrote one letter six weeks after Mother's Day,
then you wrote another letter about a month after that?

A. Correct.

Q. In between the two letters, did you make any attempt --

A. No.

Q. -- to call Ronnie?

A. No.

Q. Okay.

Do you know whether -- do you know if your mother did?

A. Yes.

Q. She did?

A. Yes.

Q. During that one-month period?

A. Yes.

Q. Did she tell you that she tried to call Ronnie?

A. Yes.

Q. And what did she tell you happened when she tried to call Ron?

A. She said she got no answer and she also sent a letter, and we
assumed since the letters were not coming back that he had received
the letter.

(Excerpt ends.)

(Excerpt begins.).

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) All right. Okay. Okay. Okay.

When was the next communication? I think you mentioned the fourth is
-- are we on the fourth one?

A. 1992.

Q. Okay.

So -- just so I got this right.

And when in 1992, approximately, was the communication?

A. The end of '92.

Q. In December?

A. I believe it was -- I believe it was November.

Q. Okay.

And describe that communication?

A. He had called to say that he was -- (inaudible.)

MR. LEONARD: Sure.

A. When he called the house he got my ex.

MR. BREWER: He wants to know the conversation you had with Ron, when
you spoke with him.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Well, let's start over again.

Ron -- Ron called the house, right, you weren't there; is that
correct?

A. I was there.

Q. Oh, you were there in 1992?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

You mentioned your ex-husband.

A. Steven answered the phone, and did the same thing that he did the
first time to Ron.

Q. Okay.

A. And --

Q. Which --

A. I got the phone call.

Q. What you mean by that is he -- he said he was abusive to Ronnie?

A. Yes.

Q. And told Ronnie that he didn't what? That he didn't want --

A. He didn't want him calling the house.

Q. Did you overhear that?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

And tell me exactly what you heard Mr. Rufo say?

A. He told him that he didn't feel that because --

Q. Just when you say he, that's Mr. Rufo?

A. Mr. Rufo.

Q. Okay.

A. He wanted no -- he told me that he did not want me to have any
association with my children.

Q. I don't mean to be impolite, but my question was you overheard a
portion -- you overheard Mr. Rufo on the phone, right?

A. Right.

Q. I just -- and you -- and you know that was with Ronnie -- Ronnie
was -- you then picked up the phone afterwards, right?

A. I didn't hear what he said at the time.

Q. Okay.

That was my question.

A. Okay. I came in on the tail end of it. I heard it was my son and I
grabbed the phone from him so Ronnie wouldn't hang up.

Q. Okay.

Tell me what you heard at the tail end.

A. That he didn't want him calling the house anymore.

Q. Okay.

A. That was all that I heard.

Q. Where were you coming from?

A. I was coming out of the wash room and he was in the kitchen.

Q. And -- Mr. Rufo?

A. Yes.

Q. You picked up the phone?

A. Yes.

Q. And describe the conversation you had with Ronnie?

A. I took the phone into the bedroom and talked to Ronnie about the
fact that -- he was calling to let me know that he was going to be on
this program, "Studs," and wanted to make sure that we had it in our
area.

Q. Okay.

A. He was telling me about him being an EMT.

Q. Okay.

A. Went to school for that. We talked about Ronnie --

Q. Okay.

I'm sorry, how long did the telephone conversation last?

A. Little over an hour.

Q. Okay.

So you -- he told you about the -- did he say he was going to be on or
the possibility that he was going to be?

A. No, he was -- he was on.

Q. Okay.

A. It was a matter of what time.

Q. Okay.

Could it have been taped?

A. Right.

Q. And he said that he was going -- that he was an EMT or was going to
school?

A. Right.

Q. Okay.

What else did you discuss?

A. He said that he was -- he was doing some construction work on a
ranch, he said he was -- had no money. That's all he talked about, was
the fact that he had no money.

Q. Did he ask you for money?

A. No.

(Excerpt ends.)

(Excerpt begins.)

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) And you don't recall bringing a photograph of
Ronnie?

A. I always have those with me.

Q. Oh, okay.

A. They're in my -- they're in my wallet.

Q. Okay.

Do you have them with you?

A. Um-hum.

Q. May I see them?

A. Sure.

(Excerpt ends.)

(Excerpt begins.)

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) That's a photograph of Ronnie?

A. Right.

Q. And approximately how old was he at the time?

A. Ronnie was about 6 months old, 6 to 9 months old.

Q. Okay.

And this is a photograph -- what we've identified as 2 appears to be a
Polaroid type photograph?

A. Right.

A. This was taken I believe at -- I don't know if it was a house
gathering, a friend's house or something, but it was '90 -- '92,
maybe.

(Excerpt ends.)

(Excerpt begins.)

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) The two photographs that you took out of your
wallet, you carry those with you all the time?

A. Yes.

(Excerpt ends.)

(Video tape concludes playing.)

MR. LEONARD: Your Honor, at this juncture --

Is that it?

MR. BREWER: Yeah. We need to approach.

MR. LEONARD: We need to approach for a minute.

THE COURT REPORTER: With the reporter?

MR. LEONARD: Yes, please.

(The following proceedings were held at the bench, with the reporter.)

MR. BREWER: At this point the defense is going -- they've counter
designated -- there are various portions of the transcript they are
going to read from, and I've spoken earlier to Mr. Leonard concerning
objections that I have. Of all the issues outstanding for the Court to
consider is page 60 and 61, lines 12 through 25, and line 1 through
25.

And to capitalize it's just a reference to a -- to her -- Mrs. Rufo's
second husband. There's a reference to the fact she was married the
second time. We want to have it in for that purpose, to show that she
was married the second time.

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Married three times. You're not going to go to
the three because --

MR. BREWER: I have to object to Mr. Rufo coming in --

MR. LEONARD: It's two questions. It's getting some background of this
woman. I want the jury to have a full idea of who she is. That's all.

THE COURT: That's -- objection overruled. Overruled.

MR. BREWER: Your Honor, the other area is pages 66, 67, 68, 69. These
generally fall under the category of interviews that were done after
the murders, and there are like two or three that are referenced in
there. And I think that this was the subject for a motion in limine
that the Brown estate had fought earlier.

My understanding with the court ruling in connection with this was not
relevant, but aside from that, we would object on the basis of
relevance concerning any post-murder interviews that she's done in
connection with the case.

MR. LEONARD: I don't remember that, but it's been awhile. Was there a
video on that? It goes to bias, her interest, she's done several.

THE COURT: Bias or interest?

MR. LEONARD: "Inside Edition," "A Current Affair."

MR. PETROCELLI: I have a 352 objection to this.

THE COURT: What is the nature of the testimony?

MR. LEONARD: Just asking her which TV program she did. She did, I
don't know, three or four.

MR. BREWER: In this case, you can't avoid any media coverage of her
case.

MR. LEONARD: Sure, you can.

MR. BREWER: Even you were on TV.

THE COURT: I was never interviewed.

MR. LEONARD: I think it's fair.

MR. BAKER: I intend to do it with Mr. -- the Browns. I intend to do it
with Mr. Goldman.

MR. PETROCELLI: She had nothing to do with her son's death.

MR. LEONARD: Of course not. She's looking for dollars.

THE COURT: Excuse me. She has an interest, and this is the damage
portion of the action, I believe. I think it's appropriate.

You may read.

MR. LEONARD: Thank you.

(The following proceedings were held in open court in the presence of
the jury.)

MR. BREWER: Gail Eskridge is a lawyer from my office that will be
reading the transcript along with Mr. Leonard.

MR. LEONARD: All set?

MS. ESKRIDGE: Um-hum.

MR. LEONARD: Turn to page 11, line 14.

(Reading:)

Okay. You were married to Fred Goldman in 1967?

A. Yes.

MR. LEONARD: We're on page 11, line 14.

MS. ESKRIDGE: I'm sorry, I was a line above.

MR. LEONARD: Okay.

(Reading:)

A. That is correct. January.

MR. LEONARD: Page 15, line 3.

(Reading:)

Q. Okay. Now, during the period 1976 to 1988 or '89, during which you
were working at -- is it Alexian?

A. A-l-e-x-i-a-n.

Q. Brothers?

A. Right.

Q. Hospital?

A. Yes.

MR. LEONARD: Down to line 21.

(Reading:)

During that period -- for some period you were married to Fred
Goldman, correct? When did you get divorced from Fred Goldman?

A. 1974.

MR. LEONARD: Over to page 16, line 19.

And why did you leave Alexian Brothers?

I was working on three different shifts and weekends and holidays, and
they -- It was just too stressful for me and it left me no time to see
my children, so - because my children weren't living with me, they
gave me weekends and holidays and things. So I -- I didn't want that
anymore. I wanted something in the day time.

Q. And they wouldn't do that?

A. There was no opening. Once I had left -- I started on the day shift
and as soon as I went -- went to the 3:00 to 11 o'clock, and 11:00 to
7:00 shift, I could not go back to that -- There was no openings in
the daytime in that department.

Q. Do you recall when that -- when the shift occurred approximately
during that 10 to 11-year period?

In other words, you described having to move from one shift to
another?

A. I -- I basically -- I basically when I started working for them, I
worked a day shift, I worked 7 to 3:30.

Q. And how long did that last approximately?

A. That lasted maybe about, roughly 7 years.

Q. Okay.

A. Maybe -- I'm sorry. It's just hard to remember.

Q. I understand.

You were shifted to the --

A. 3 to 11 shift.

Q. 3 to 11. Okay.

And when you got shifted to the 3 to 11 o'clock shift one of the
results was that you weren't able to see your children, right?

A. Plus -- Right.

Q. Okay.

A. It was totally inconvenient.

Q. Now, which children are you referring to?

A. My son, Ronnie.

Q. Okay.

A. -- And Kimberly.

Q. And those were the only two children you have?

A. Yes.

Q. Obviously Ron's dead, but --

A. Yes.

Q. So from 1976 until approximately 1982 you were able to see the
children; is that correct?

A. I was able to see them, but like I say, there was a lot of
scheduling problems. But I did the best I could to see them, that's
what was -- whenever I had a weekend or a scheduled visit.

Q. And during that period, where were the children living?

A. They were living --

Q. And if they moved -- let me know that in there. In other words,
from 19 -- From '76 to '82?

A. They moved with their father. They were living with their father
and I believe they were already living in Buffalo Grove.

Q. Which state is that in?

A. Illinois.

MR. LEONARD: Over to page 21, line 8.

(Reading:)

Q. I may have asked you this.

At what point as far as you recollect did Fred and the children move
to California?

A. In either in 1987 or 1988. I'm not sure.

Q. Can you give me an estimate of how often you would see the children
from the time you left the home until they moved to California?

In other words, was it -- did you see them on a weekly basis, a daily
basis, a monthly basis, the best estimate you can give?

I know it's a big question. And if there are periods when you saw them
less you can break that up for me.

A. Were we talking about when the children were -- after.

Q. No, when the children --

A. They went to -- The children were living with me up until
approximately 1976.

Q. Okay. Yeah, that's what -- I'm sorry.

A. Right.

Q. I thought I said from -- I'm sorry about that.

So the children lived with you until '76, right?

A. Yes.

MR. LEONARD: Over to page 23, line 4.

(Reading:)

Q. So from 1976 until Fred moved with the children to California, and
whenever that was, 19 -- 1987 you said approximately?

A. Yes.

Q. I'm changing my question.

How often would you see the children?

A. At least at the beginning, probably I would say every two, two to
three times a months at the beginning.

Q. What do you mean by the beginning. Can you try to define that in
terms of years or months?

A. In 1977 we had joint custody and I was able to see the children a
lot.

Q. Okay. So, at -- So it was --

A. At the -- At the end of the 70's, beginning of the 80's, I would
see my children at least two or three times every month or two
depending on my scheduling.

Q. From 1976 until the end of the 70's or beginning of the 80's?

A. Beginning of the 80's.

Q. You can't be any more definite than that?

A. There was a marriage in there and I'm trying --

MR. LEONARD: Reading. (Reading:)

MR. BREWER: This is yes or no.

Can you be any more definite?

A. No, no.

Q. Okay. And so that was when you defined as the beginning, right?

A. Yes.

Q. And then after that until they left for California, how often would
you see the children?

A. There were periods -- one -- I would say one -- it was either one
or two times every month or every other month. It was sporadic
throughout that time period.

Q. After the children moved to California with their father, how often
would you see them until the time of Ron's death?

A. I didn't see my children. MR. LEONARD: Over to line -- over to page
60, line 12. Got that? (Reading:)

Q. Was that the last communication you had with Ron prior to his
death?

A. Unfortunately, yes.

Q. And you didn't send him any letters or --

A. No, I did not.

MR. LEONARD: And by the way, that's referring to the 1992 call, just
so the record is clear.

(Reading:)

Q. And did not try to call him?

A. No, I didn't.

Q. And in that conversation did you ask Ron why he hadn't responded to
your letters?

A. No.

Q. Okay. I just want to go back and fill in some background
information.

You've been married three times?

A. Yes.

Q. And your first marriage was to Mr. Goldman?

A. Yes.

Q. And that -- Fred Goldman.

And that was from 1974 -- excuse me, go ahead.

A. 1967 to until '74.

Q. And 1974, is that when you separated or was that the actual
divorce?

A. We divorced but we were still seeing each other.

Q. In 1974, that's when the actual formal divorce --

A. Final divorce, yes.

Q. Were you still living together?

A. No. We took a vacation together in 1976.

Q. When did you stop living together with Mr. Goldman?

A. In 19 -- 1974.

Q. The children lived with you from 1974 until 19 --

A. '76.

Q. When was your next marriage?

A. In 1976.

Q. And that was to?

MR. LEONARD: Over to page 65, line 18.

A. Yes.

Q. How many? Do you know?

A. I believe there was only three.

Q. Do you recall just the names of the programs and the approximate
dates?

A. I know "Larry King Show."

gathering of any kind, concerning the Simpson case?

A. Yes, I did. I'm sorry. I did. I did one television in my house.

Q. What was that?

A. It was -- It was to protest about the pictures that were in "The
Globe" tabloid.

Q. Okay.

A. And they were showing graphic pictures of Ronnie and Nicole and it
upset me and I made a plea to people to just not buy the magazine.

Q. Was that the local television?

A. Right.

Q. Here in St. Louis?

A. That was local in St. Louis.

Q. Were there several reporter's there, was it just a single --

A. No, there were -- there were about four stations, five stations
that came out.

Q. Would that have been during the trial or -- well, it was whenever.
It was shortly after the --

A. It was whenever the -- You know, it was whenever it was.

Q. Other than that, have you participated in any other public meetings
or appearances relative to the Simpson case?

A. Not that I'm aware of.

Q. You --

A. I did a -- I went to the signing of Chris Darden's when he came in
to St. Louis and he was promoting his book.

Q. Okay.

A. I went to his signing.

Q. Were you invited to that or how did that happen? How did it happen
that you went to the signing?

A. One of the reporter's from Channel 2 called me to tell me he was
going to be in town, and I hadn't seen him, I thought it would be a
good idea to go and meet him, you know, meet him in person and talk to
him.

Q. And was it your intention when you went there to make any kind of
public statement or appearance?

A. No.

Q. Was it -- No. Okay.

Was it your intention when you went there to pose with Mr. Darden?

A. No.

Q. In any photograph?

A. No.

Q. Did you in fact do that?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Okay.

A. Well, I didn't pose with him. They took pictures of him and I.

Q. Did you bring anything with you to the book signing?

A. No, just myself, and I bought a book.

Q. You don't recall bringing a photograph of Ronnie?

A. I always have those with me.

Q. Oh, okay.

A. They're in my -- they're in my wallet.

MR. LEONARD: I think this was played.

Okay. Over to line to page 71, line 18 -- actually, line 21.

(Reading:)

Q. And how did you get the Exhibit No. 2.

That's one of the -- for the record that's one of the photographs of
Mr. Goldman.

A. This is Exhibit No. 2?

Q. Yeah, the larger photograph.

A. Okay. It was sent to me by my mother.

Q. When did that happen?

A. As soon as she received it, I got it.

Q. Okay. When did that happen?

A. If it's -- If it says -- I didn't even know that it, I it'd on
here. It would have been right after she got it.

Q. Yeah.

A. In 1990. MR. LEONARD: Okay. Over to page 73, line 8. (Reading:)

Q. You received a lot of photographs, you said, from whom?

A. My mother.

Q. Did you receive those all at one time?

A. No.

Q. And were those -- and these were photographs of Ronnie that you
received?

A. Well, okay Okay. When you said "I received -- I received a lot of
photographs," were you referring to photographs of Ronnie?

A. I had my old pictures of my daughter and Ronnie.

Q. Right.

A. -- Up until the time they moved to California.

Q. Okay?

A. Any pictures after that were sent to my mother.

Q. Okay.

A. I did not -- This was one -- probably one of the pictures that I
would have been waiting for from Ronnie but I did not get it. My
mother got the picture instead.

Q. And is it your testimony that from the -- From time to time your
mother would send you photographs that she had received from Ronnie?

A. If I didn't get them. Yes, yes.

Q. Well, what I'm asking is it's not the case that at some point your
mother sent you a whole packet --

A. No.

Q. -- of photographs?

A. No.

Q. That was -- That's all I was asking.

MR. LEONARD: Over to the next page.

(Reading:)

A. No.

Q. So you received some of these photographs prior to Ronnie's death,
correct, from your mother?

A. I had, yes.

Q. Did you receive any photographs from your mother after Ronnie's
death?

A. Yes.

Q. Did you receive a group of photographs?

A. No.

Q. How many photographs did you receive from your mother after
Ronnie's death?

A. Maybe six -- five or six.

Q. And was that on five or six different occasions?

A. Yes.

Q. Did she send them to you or did you get them from her personally?

A. She lives in Florida, so she sent them to me.

Q. And this was five or six different occasions after Ron's death that
she would send these to you?

A. Not after Ronnie death.

Q. She has not?

A. No.

Q. Just to clarify, prior to Ronnie's death and after the children
left for California, your mother sent you pictures of Ronnie on five
or six different occasions?

A. Yes.

A. Yes.

Q. The two photographs that you took out of your wallet, you carry
those with you all the time?

A. Yes.

Q. How long have you done that?

A. Since Ronnie's murder.

MR. LEONARD: I don't have any further questions.

MR. BREWER: Nothing further.

THE COURT: Take a 10-minute recess.

Ladies and gentlemen, don't talk about the case. Don't form or express
any opinions.

MR. KELLY: Your Honor, could we approach briefly before we call the
next witness?

THE COURT: Yes.

MR. KELLY: Yeah.

(The following proceedings were

held at the bench:)

MR. KELLY: Your Honor, the next witness is Juditha Brown, Nicole's
mother. I'm just putting her on briefly for a very limited purpose to
-- at the very end Mr. Baker indicated that he intended to ask
questions about her testimony and or participation at the child
custody proceeding down in Orange County.

I would object to any questions being asked regarding that at this
time. I think it's irrelevant. I'm offering her for very limited
scope, and that proceeding is finished down there except for
summations. Anyway, I don't think there's any reason to get into it at
all, Your Honor, plus it's a sealed proceeding.

MR. BAKER: Well, the fact that she's doing it goes to her bias. The
fact that she is suing my client.

THE COURT: You may ask her if they're involved in a proceeding.

MR. BAKER: I'm not going to get into the substance.

THE COURT: That's what I don't want.

MR. BAKER: No.

MR. KELLY: Just a yes or no.

THE COURT: Within reason.

MR. BAKER: Thank you.

MR. KELLY: Oh, his and mine is entirely different.

THE COURT: Well, there's a thing you can do.

MR. KELLY: Okay.

THE COURT: The thing is to object and approach the bench:

(The following proceedings were held in open court in the presence of
the jury.)

MR. KELLY: Ms. Juditha Brown.

THE CLERK: Would you please raise your right hand to be sworn.

JUDITHA BROWN, called as a witness on behalf of the Plaintiffs, was
duly sworn and testified as follows:

THE CLERK: You do solemnly swear that the testimony you may give in
the cause now pending before this court shall be the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

THE WITNESS: I do.

THE CLERK: And would you please state and spell your name also for the
record.

THE WITNESS: J-u-d-i-t-h a, B-r-o-w-n.

A. Yes.

MR. KELLY: Can you can take it down, Steve.

THE COURT REPORTER: Excuse me; I need a number on that.

MR. FOSTER: 2246.

MR. KELLY: 2246?

MR. FOSTER: (Nods affirmatively.)

(The instrument herein referred to as Photograph of Juditha Brown with
her daughter, Nicole Brown Simpson, was marked for identification as
Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 2246.)

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) Now, Mrs. Brown, eventually, Mr. Simpson and Nicole

Q. Now, did there come a time on any occasion after Nicole's 35th
birthday that you spoke to Mr. Simpson?

Q. Okay.

And did you speak to him in person or by telephone?

A. No, by telephone.

Q. And did you call him or did he call you?

A. He called me.

Q. And do you recall what the substance of that conversation was?

A. Yes. He said, "She may not love me anymore."

And I said --

Q. "She" meaning Nicole?

A. Yes.

And I said, "Well, then, go on with your life."

And he said, "I tell you, the first time when she left me, I take the
blame; it was my fault. But the second time, it's gonna hurt."

Q. Was there any further conversation after he said that to you?

A. That was it.

Q. This is a very brief conversation?

A. Brief conversation.

And I didn't speak to him for three weeks.

Q. When was the next time you spoke to him, by the way?

A. I spoke to him at the recital.

Q. And that was on June 12?

A. That was on June 12.

Q. Now, I want to take you to June 8, 1994, which was four days before
Nicole was murdered.

Do you recall seeing Nicole on that day?

A. Yes.

Q. Do you recall where you saw Nicole on that day?

A. I saw Nicole in her house.

Q. Was anybody else with you at that time?

A. Yes. My husband.

Q. Okay.

And what were you doing at Nicole's house, first of all?

A. Well, it was Justin's graduation.

Q. And did you go up to Nicole's house and see her, before you went to
the graduation?

A. Yes.

Q. Visit with her at all?

A. Yes.

Q. Do you recall what type of visit you had with her before going to
the graduation?

A. Yes.

Q. What were you doing?

A. We --

MR. BAKER: I'm going to object to any hearsay, Your Honor and the
relevancy of this.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. KELLY: To explain subsequent action, Your Honor. This conversation
--

MR. BAKER: I would request an offer of proof.

THE COURT: Attorneys approach the bench.

(The following proceedings were held at the bench, with the reporter.)

MR. KELLY: Ms. Brown had a conversation with Nicole, in the kitchen,
regarding a couple of books that Nicole was presently reading at that
time. During the course of this conversation, Nicole actually --

THE COURT: Hold your voice down.

MR. KELLY: I'm sorry.

Nicole actually handed one of the books to Ms. Brown that she wanted
her to read, asked her to have a look at it. Nicole told her she was
reading the book at that time, and then put it back down.

At a much later date in time, Ms. Brown found the book again, and she
is just going to testify as to which book it was and some of the
notations there where Nicole --

MR. BAKER: That's all hearsay, Your Honor. That's all hearsay. And her
subsequent conduct isn't an issue in this case.

MR. PETROCELLI: Oh, yes, it is.

THE COURT: What is the relevance?

MR. KELLY: It actually --

THE COURT: Excuse me. Keep your voice down.

MR. KELLY: I'm sorry, Judge.

THE COURT: What is the relevance of the book?

MR. KELLY: It goes directly to her state of mind. The book was --

THE COURT: You're not telling me anything.

MR. KELLY: The book was written -- was by Leonore Walker, who was the
expert retained by Mr. Simpson in this case. Also, who is the foremost
authority on abuse to women that was the author of the book Nicole was
reading.

The book, at that time, indicated to Juditha Brown, she's reading the
book, marking up the book, and wanted Juditha to read it afterwards,
and indicated to her sorry how she felt in terms of her relationship
to Mr. Simpson, also, that the book was reflective of it.

Judge, this is more current than the diary entries of June 2,
subsequent to the other entries.

THE COURT: You're not being very helpful.

What is it that she -- what is it that you're talking about?

MR. KELLY: First of all, the book, the subject --

THE COURT: What's the other book?

MR. KELLY: It's called Battered Women.

Would you like to see the book, Your Honor?

THE COURT: No.

MR. KELLY: Okay.

THE COURT: What is it in there that she allegedly underlined?

MR. KELLY: Certain passages in the book that we feel is regarding
behavior that we think is reflective of her own state of mind, and
notations reflective of her state of mind in terms of --

THE COURT: How are you going to establish that?

MR. KELLY: Conversations with her mother, and the identification of
her own handwriting.

MR. BAKER: Her state of mind is irrelevant to any issue.

MR. KELLY: Her state of mind has been relevant to every issue,
including her conduct at the recital, and after the recital, in terms
of her attitude toward Mr. Simpson. This is four days --

THE COURT: Excuse me. You want to offer somebody else's book as a
state of mind of Nicole?

MR. KELLY: I want to offer it because it contains notations that
Nicole made in her --

THE COURT: What kind of notation is it?

MR. KELLY: Notations, comments that reflect her own state of mind.

THE COURT: Such as?

MR. KELLY: Could I grab the book and bring it up here, Your Honor?

THE COURT: Oh, all right.

(Pause in the proceedings for Mr. Kelly to get the book "Battered
Women," authored by Lenore Walker.)

MR. KELLY: And there's certain passages on three pages, pages 6 and 9.

(Pause in the proceedings for the Court to read passages in "Battered
Women" by Lenore Walker to which Mr. Kelly referred.)

THE COURT: What is the witness going to testify about these markings?

MR. KELLY: That Nicole indicated to her, Ms. Brown, that she should
read this book when she was done with it, and she said, "Mom, I'm
going -- I'm an abused woman, also."

THE COURT: Excuse me?

MR. KELLY: She said, "Mom, I'm an abused woman, also; and I want you
to look at this book when I'm done with it."

And she gave it to Juditha, who glanced at it, and put it down, and
then saw it later on.

Your Honor, we feel it goes directly to state of mind four days
before.

MR. BAKER: I keep saying her state of mind is irrelevant.

THE COURT: I think her state of mind is relevant.

You have an objection to this? Give me your objection to this.

MR. BAKER: This is hearsay. Her state mind is irrelevant. They keep
saying her state of mind is relevant four days before.

Her state of mind is irrelevant. Irrelevant.

The problem with this is, there is no way to cross-examine her. This
could have been done 15 years ago, 19 years ago, whatever. And this
woman is exceptionally biased against my client. She got him sued on
two fronts.

It's just as relevant as that picture.

THE COURT: Wait. Wait. Okay.

I've already made a finding that state of mind is relevant, and I'm
trying to get you to tell me what why this is -- this shouldn't come
in. You're telling me some of it, but you keep going back to the state
of mind.

MR. BAKER: Well, number one --

THE COURT: Focus your arguments on the book that's --

MR. BAKER: I've never seen the book before; I've never seen the
passages before.

From what I'm looking at, all I'd say is, number one --

THE COURT: Your objection was -- I think you're saying that there is
inadequate foundation.

MR. BAKER: There's inadequate foundation.

Under 352, the probative value of this book goes to -- the prejudicial
value is much too great. I would request that the Court exclude it.

MR. KELLY: Your Honor, this is four days before the murder; it goes
directly to her -- not only her state of mind, but --

THE COURT: What is your foundation that she wrote these underlined --
these things that you say she underlined?

MR. KELLY: She indicated to her mother, she was reading it and marking
it up, and showed it to her mother, that she was doing it. At this
time, she said, "I've just started it; I'll give to you afterwards."

And she can identify her handwriting.

THE COURT: I think under 352, the foundation is totally inadequate.
I'm going to exclude it.

(The following proceedings were held in open court, in the presence of
the jury.)

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) Mrs. Brown, did there come a time that you left
Nicole's condominium that day, June 8, on Bundy, and went in -- where
else?

A. Yes. We went to Justin's graduation.

Q. And who, besides yourself, went to Justin's graduation at this
time?

A. My husband, Lou, and Nicole.

Q. And could you describe Nicole's demeanor, at this time, at Justin's
graduation.

MR. BAKER: Relevancy, Your Honor.

THE COURT: What was the question again, please?

MR. KELLY: I asked her to describe Nicole's demeanor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. Nicole was very nervous, extremely nervous. She kept looking to the
gate.

Q. Did Mr. Simpson ever show up at the graduation that day?

A. No, he did not.

MR. KELLY: Now, if I can see the photo.

(Photograph displayed.)

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) I ask you to look at that photograph, Mrs. Brown.

MR. FOSTER: 2247.

(The instrument herein referred to as Photograph of Nicole Brown
Simpson, wearing a black dress was marked for identification as
Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 2247.)

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) Do you recognize that?

A. Yes.

Q. That's Nicole?

A. That's Nicole.

Q. And can you tell us what Nicole is doing at that time?

A. She was taking movies, while I was using the still camera.

Q. Okay.

MR. KELLY: Steve, can you focus in a little bit on the camera in her
hands.

(Mr. Foster complies.)

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) And you took that picture yourself?

A. Yes.

The last picture I ever took.

Q. Okay.

And, Ms. Brown, do you recognize --

MR. KELLY: You can back it off a little bit now, Steve. Leave it up
there. Move it back a little bit.

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) Do you recognize the dress that Nicole has on in
that photograph?

A. Yes, I do.

Q. Okay.

And did you ever see that dress on Nicole again after that day?

MR. BAKER: Relevancy.

A. Yes.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. (Continuing) At the graduation -- at the recital. I'm sorry.

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) Okay.

And do you know whether or not that's the dress she was wearing when
she was murdered that night?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

Now -- and I apologize for having to ask you these questions, Ms.
Brown -- did you ever get that dress back?

A. No, we have not.

MR. BAKER: Objection. Relevancy.

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) Do you know where that dress is, as of today?

A. Yes. It's still with -- I guess with the D.A.'s office. They kept
it. I don't know how you call it -- it's still bloody, wrapped up.

MR. KELLY: Steve, can I see a picture --

MR. FOSTER: 48.

MR. BAKER: I object to the relevancy of this.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. BAKER: Take it down, Steve.

MR. KELLY: Do you want to take it down?

(1994 briefly displayed.)

MR. KELLY: Judge, can we approach briefly?

THE COURT: No.

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) Did you ever go shopping with Nicole, Ms. Brown?

A. Yes.

Q. You familiar with the stores she used to shop in?

MR. BAKER: Your Honor --

A. Yes.

MR. BAKER: -- object to the relevancy.

MR. KELLY: This goes right to the cause of action.

If we could briefly --

THE COURT: You may.

(The following proceedings were held at the bench, with the reporter.)

MR. KELLY: Your Honor, on behalf of the estate, survival goes -- one
of the things we have to do, in addition to demonstrate some period of
time of survival after the initial intentional act, is some sort of
economical damages. And in our case, it's the dress.

If Mr. Baker wants to stipulate and place a value someplace on it,
that's okay. Otherwise, I have to step --

MR. PETROCELLI: I have the same issue as to Ron's clothing.

THE COURT: If it's for a relevant purpose, fine. If it's for some
other purpose --

MR. KELLY: No, it's not.

THE COURT: -- I'm prepared to sustain an objection.

MR. BAKER: We already had these pictures as if she -- the party
plaintiff, instead of the estate, the picture with her and Nicole is
irrelevant. I mean, I --

MR. KELLY: Do you want to stipulate 250 bucks?

MR. BAKER: 100 bucks. 250 bucks. I'll do that.

MR. PETROCELLI: I'd like a stipulation as to Ron's articles of
clothing, $100 property damage for Ron's clothing, so I don't have to
get into it with my client.

MR. BAKER: That's fine.

MR. KELLY: 250 on Nicole's clothing.

MR. BAKER: That dress is 250. It's $50 a yard. Done.

(The following proceedings were held in open court, in the presence of
the jury.)

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) Ms. Brown, going to June 12 of 1994, did you see
Nicole on that day?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay. Where did you first see her?

Q. We went to her home first, in the afternoon.

Q. Who's we?

A. My husband, and Denise and Dominique, and just Erin and Sean.

Q. And were you going somewhere else after you'd gone to the
condominium that day?

A. Yes.

Q. Where did you intend to go?

A. We went to the recital, to see the recital.

Q. And do you know what, if any, plans you had for after the recital,
also?

A. Yes. We were going out to eat at Mezzaluna.

Q. And do you know who was to attend that dinner at Mezzaluna after
the recital?

A. All of us except O.J.

Q. You mean Mr. Simpson?

A. Mr. Simpson.

Q. And did you -- do you know whether or not Mr. Simpson was attending
the recital?

A. Yes, he was.

Q. Okay.

And it was clear to you before you went there, that Mr. Simpson was
not to come out to dinner with you afterwards?

A. That's right.

Q. Okay.

Now, you then went to the recital?

A. Yes.

Q. And where was the recital, by the way?

A. I can't -- it wasn't far from Nicole's house. I've been there so
many times, and I don't know --

Q. Okay.

A. I don't know the address.

Q. It was for Sydney?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, when you got there, did there come a time you saw Mr. Simpson
arrive there, also?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

This recital was held in a gymnasium?

A. Yes, in the school.

Q. There's a school stage up there?

A. Yes.

Q. A lot of people there when you first arrived?

A. Lots of them.

Q. Okay. Now, did you see Mr. Simpson, yourself, when he first arrived
there that day?

A. Yes.

Q. And can you describe Mr. Simpson's demeanor as it appeared to you
when you saw him that day the first time.

A. Do you want to know when he first came to me?

Q. Sure.

A. We were sitting in a room, my husband and I, and Mr. Fischman and
his son and Mr. Simpson came down, and he put his hands on his hips,
and he looked at me, and didn't say a word. And he looked through me.

And I started to feel very uncomfortable, and I said, "Well, what's
happening?" I said something to this effect. And then I guess he sat
down.

Q. When you described his eyes as black, had you ever seen that look
in Mr. Simpson?

A. Never.

Q. Okay.

And did you have occasion to see Mr. Simpson on other occasions,
during the course of the recital?

A. Yes.

Q. And do you recall how long the recital lasted for?

A. About two hours, I think it was.

Q. And how would you describe Mr. Simpson's basic demeanor the entire
time inside at the recital, during those two hours?

A. He was angry.

Q. Did you talk to him anymore inside the recital?

A. No.

Q. You see him smile at all?

A. No.

Q. See him laughing at all?

A. No.

Q. See him talking to Nicole at all?

A. No.

Q. Now, what did you do when the recital ended that day, Ms. Brown?

A. We waited until the end, and then we went outside, my husband and
I.

Q. Why did you wait till the end?

A. Well, first, Sydney was on next to last. And second, we knew that
Mr. Simpson wasn't coming with us, and we did not want to get into any
argument -- not argument, but in any conversation, so we waited.

Q. And then you left?

A. And when we left, he came -- he was standing outside.

Q. Who's "he"? I'm sorry.

A. Mr. Simpson was standing outside. And he said, "All I wanted to
give Sydney was some flowers," and looked the other direction.

So I ignored it and I said, wasn't she beautiful; wasn't the dance
great; and how well she did. And I started walking.

Q. Did you have any other conversation with Mr. Simpson at that time?

A. No.

Q. Was there any discussion?

A. Only after we reached the cars. Nicole drove around and met us at
the curb, and I said to him, I said, "You're not going to have dinner
with us, right?"

And he said no, no.

Q. Now, I think you indicated that was going to be the first time Mr.
Simpson was not invited to join you and the family after a family --

A. That's right.

Q. -- gathering; is that right?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

And how were you feeling at that point when you walked out to the curb
with Mr. Simpson?

MR. BAKER: Objection. Relevancy, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. MR. KELLY: What was Mr. Simpson's demeanor as you were walking out
of the gymnasium, first of all?

A. He seemed nervous and angry.

Q. Now --

A. He seemed upset.

Q. Then you talked to him when you got outside?

A. I said -- well, only that, "You're not coming with us, right?"

And he said no.

So I went in the car.

MR. KELLY: Steve could I see 825, please.

(Exhibit 825 is displayed on the Elmo Screen.)

MR. KELLY: I'm going to show you this -- a portion of this video. I
think you've seen it before, Ms. Brown.

(Videotape played.)

MR. KELLY: You can stop it, Steve.

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) Now, you saw Mr. Simpson smiling and and laughing
outside the recital --

A. That's right.

Q. -- is that correct?

Prior to that time, the two hours you'd seen him inside, had you seen
him smile at all?

A. Not at all.

MR. BAKER: Objection. Foundation that she was in a place where she
could see him for two hours.

THE COURT: Lay a foundation.

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) Were you able to see Mr. Simpson when you were
inside at the recital?

A. Yes. I looked back one time, and he had Justin on his lap, and his
eyes were going back and forth, and he seemed very angry.

Q. And did you see him on any other occasions during the recital?

A. Yes. I looked back at -- another time, at intermission, and he was
standing beside -- under the main door, and Nicole was sitting here,
and he kept looking like this (indicating) and went back so she
wouldn't see him, I guess. I don't know.

Q. Did you see him smile or laugh or anything --

A. No, no.

Q. -- when you observed him?

A. No.

MR. KELLY: 826, Steve.

(Exhibit 826 displayed)

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) Have you ever seen that photograph before, Ms.
Brown?

A. I've seen the photograph.

Q. You see Mr. Simpson smiling in that photograph?

A. Yeah.

Q. Okay.

Did you see --

A. There's a camera.

Q. Was this reflective of his general demeanor that day, inside at the
recital?

A. Not at all.

Q. Okay.

MR. KELLY: You can take that down, Steve.

(Mr. Foster complies.)

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) Now, where did you go after the recital, Mrs. Brown?

A. After the recital, we went to Mezzaluna, to the restaurant.

Q. Who was "we?"

A. Denise, Dominique, my husband Lou, Sean, Erin and a little girl
named Rachel, and Sydney and Justin, and Nicole and I.

Q. Okay. And you had dinner there that night?

A. We had dinner there.

Q. Did you have a good time?

A. Great time.

Q. And what kind of mood was Nicole in that night?

A. She was in a great mood.

Q. Okay.

Q. And yourself?

A. Yes, also.

Q. Okay.

A. I was a little nervous, still, from the evening.

Q. What were you nervous about?

MR. BAKER: Objection. Relevancy, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) Did there come a time that you finished dinner, were
leaving Mezzaluna?

A. Right, yes.

Q. And you were heading home, down to Orange County, at this time?

A. Yes.

Q. And who was going with you at that time?

A. Denise, Sean, and my husband, Lou, Dominique, and Erin.

Q. And you left the restaurant?

A. Yes.

Q. Was Nicole with you when you walked out of the restaurant?

A. Yes.

Q. And what observations did you make, if any, when you were leaving
there, and going out to the car?

A. She ran -- went to have an ice cream. She crossed the street, and
she -- she went to have some ice cream with Justin, Sydney, and the
little girl named Rachel.

And as my family was walking towards the jeep, I stopped for some
reason, and I looked back at her again, and I saw her walking. And I
was thinking, "What a gorgeous girl. What great legs." Those were my
thoughts.

Q. This is Nicole you're speaking of?

A. Pardon me.

Q. Nicole?

A. Yes.

Q. And was this the last time you saw Nicole?

A. That's the last time I saw her alive.

Q. Now, did you get in the car, then, and head down towards your
house?

A. Yes. I -- we looked for my glasses, still, I know, because I didn't
have the glasses in the restaurant. So we looked in the jeep and we
didn't see them. And it was 8:30 by that time and the children had to
go to bed, so we said, well, let's go; I'll call.

Q. And did you get in the car and head down to Orange County?

A. We drove home.

And on the way home, a terrible depression came over me, something I
have never experienced. My whole body got really heavy. And I haven't
had it before and I haven't had it afterwards. It was -- it was a
whole feeling.

And as we arrived at home, I shook myself, and I thought, "God, I have
to buy a pair of new glasses again." And I went on the phone and I
called Mezzaluna.

MR. KELLY: If I could see 25, Steve.

You have it.

(The instrument herein referred to as Plastic bag containing glasses
and other items was marked Plaintiffs' Exhibit 25 for identification
by reference to Criminal Trial No. BA097211 )

(Photograph of Exhibit 25 displayed on the Elmo Screen.)

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) I ask you to look at these.

And do you recognize those, Ms. Brown?

A. I guess.

Q. Those appear to be your glasses from that night?

A. They possibly are. I don't remember anymore, I'm sure they are.

Q. Now, after you got home, you -- I'm sorry -- do you recall who you
spoke to at Mezzaluna?

A. It was a woman. No, I don't remember her name.

Q. Do you recall the substance of the conversation?

A. Yes. I said can you -- I know I left my glasses somewhere; could
you please check outside. Because I had Justin on my lap, and as I got
out of the car, I said, maybe they had fallen out, and there was a
puddle in front where we got out. So I said, could you just check
there and see if you find my glasses.

And she returned and she says, "Yes, I have them."

I said, "What luck."

Q. And anything else in that conversation?

A. And I said, "Well I'm going to call my daughter and tell her to
pick up the glasses in the morning."

Q. Did you then call Nicole?

A. Then I called Nicole and I said, "You know, I found my glasses over
there. Would you please pick them up in the morning."

And she said, oh, you know -- and she said a name, but it just slipped
my mind, but who it was -- and she says "can bring it to Starbuck's
Cafe, because we always talk, and we can meet there, and he can bring
them."

Q. Okay. Anything else in the conversation?

A. And then she said good night, and "I love you."

And I said, "I love you." And those were the last words.

Q. Did you receive a phone call the next morning?

A. Yes.

Q. Do you recall who it was from?

A. Yes. It was between 6:00 and 7:00, and I -- I was in a deep sleep
for some reason. And the phone call woke me up. And -- and Arnelle was
on the phone, and she was sobbing, Mr. Simpson's daughter. And she
sobbed. And I knew something had happened to Nicole. And then Tom -- I
think it was Tom Lange what came to the phone -- and he says, "Your
daughter is dead."

Q. That was Nicole?

A. And that was Nicole.

Q. Now, on June 15, Ms. Brown --

A. On June 15.

Q. Was there a wake for Nicole?

A. Yes, there was.

Q. Okay.

And you were there at the wake?

A. Yes.

Q. And that was an open-casket wake?

A. Yes.

Q. And did Mr. Simpson attend that?

A. Yes, he did.

Q. And were you there when Mr. Simpson arrived?

A. Yes.

Q. Do you recall what Mr. Simpson --

A. I was next to -- I was at the coffin, and Mr. Simpson came back --
came in and he said, "Could you move? Could you move? I have to be
alone."

And I heard him say, "I'm so sorry, Nic. I'm so sorry." And he kissed
her on the lips.

Q. And did you do anything then, after you observed that with Mr.
Simpson?

A. Yeah. He walked away, and then I followed him and I confronted him,
very close, and I said, "Did you have anything to do with this?"

And he said, "I loved your daughter." And that was the end.

Q. Did he ever answer your question, though, Ms. Brown?

A. No.

MR. KELLY: I have no further questions.

THE COURT: Cross.

CROSS-EXAMINATION

MR. BAKER: Play the tape.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You granted an interview, did you not, Ms. Brown,
about the death of Nicole to various TV stations, et cetera, did you
not?

A. Yes.

Q. And that very question, that -- the last question that Mr. Kelly
just asked you, was asked you, was it not?

A. I don't understand you.

Q. I'm sorry; it's a vague question. Let me rephrase it.

Mr. Kelly just asked you about the wake --

A. Right.

Q. -- and about your confrontation with Mr. Simpson concerning whether
he had anything to do with the death of Nicole. Do you recall that?

A. Right.

Q. And you told, on your first TV interview after the murders, you
said that O.J. answered, "No. I loved your daughter." Isn't that
correct?

A. I don't remember that.

Q. Play it.

(Videotape of interview with Diana Sawyer and Juditha and Louis Brown
was played in open court.)

At the wake, in the viewing. Yes, I said: Did you have have anything
to do with that? MS. SAWYER: And he said MRS. BROWN: And he said no I
loved your daughter.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) So, Mr. Simpson, in fact, answered you, and said he
didn't have anything to do with it; isn't that true?

A. Well, after what I heard, yeah.

Q. The plaintiff in this case is the estate of Nicole Brown Simpson,
correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And would you tell us all what your relationship -- in other words,
you're not a party plaintiff to this case; you would agree with that?

A. Right.

Q. And the plaintiff is the estate of Nicole Brown Simpson, true?

A. Right.

Q. And what are you to that? Are you the executor of the estate?

How do you fit into that estate of Nicole Brown, estate of Nicole
Brown Simpson?

A. I --

MR. KELLY: Objection. Calls for a legal conclusion from this witness.

MR. BAKER: To the best of your knowledge.

MR. KELLY: Same objection.

THE COURT: I'll sustain the objection, allow you to lead, and you can
ask her.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Okay.

Let me put it this way: The estate of Nicole Brown Simpson has as
beneficiary -- the only beneficiaries of that estate which is suing
Mr. Simpson in this case is his children, Justin and Sydney; isn't
that true?

A. True.

Q. And you and Mr. Brown have ensured that Mr. Simpson's children are
suing him through this case; isn't that right?

MR. KELLY: Objection. Argumentative, Your Honor. Relevance, also.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You are suing Mr. Simpson in another venue, in
Orange County, over the custody of his children, are you not?

A. Yes, we are.

Q. And you have seen Mr. Simpson in court in Orange County, in that
case, every day for the last two weeks, while you have this case going
on up here; isn't that true?

MR. KELLY: Objection. Relevance, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. Yes, it's true.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, in terms of your -- your representations of --
well, let me ask you this:

Mr. Simpson had talked to you in April or May about his concern over
what he termed "erratic behavior" of your daughter, had he not.

MR. KELLY: Objection. Scope, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. When did he talk to me?

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) In April and May of `1994, about what he described
to you as "erratic behavior" of your daughter, correct?

A. Not at all.

Q. You, at one point in April of 1994, indicated to him that you
thought Nicole's behavior was erratic; she was telling you things that
she had said, you had said on the phone, when, in fact, you had not
uttered those ideas at all; isn't that true?

MR. KELLY: Objection. Calls for hearsay, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Well, let me just ask you: In your relationship with
Nicole, that you talked about, did you have a relationship that
sometimes if Nicole got mad at you, she'd just hang up?

MR. KELLY: Objection. Beyond the scope, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. BAKER: They talked about their relationship, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Not about a phone call.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Okay.

Let's go to the recital. June 12, when you say Mr. Simpson was angry,
right?

A. Yes.

Q. Play that again.

I'm going to ask you if you are the person that first kisses Mr.
Simpson.

THE COURT REPORTER: Excuse me. What is the number, please?

MR. BAKER: 825, I think.

(Exhibit 825, videotape, displayed.)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Ma'am, may I direct your attention to the monitor?

A. Sure.

(Witness views videotape.)

Q. That's you there, kissing O.J.?

A. Yes.

Q. And is it your testimony --

I'll let you watch this.

It's your testimony that Mr. Simpson was angry?

A. Mr. Simpson was angry, yes.

Q. And is it your -- that was taken at the beginning of the recital?

A. That was at the end.

Q. And -- at the end. So he'd been angry throughout the recital,
right?

A. He was very angry.

Q. And you saw that, obviously, throughout the time period that he was
at the recital, correct?

A. I didn't see it all the time, but I looked back, and I heard it
from my daughters, also.

Q. I asked you what you observed.

A. He was angry.

Q. You sat virtually directly in front of him, didn't you?

A. Right.

Q. Two rows?

A. Right.

Q. And to observe whether Mr. Simpson was angry or not angry, you
would have to turn 180 degrees in your seat to see it, correct?

A. Every time I looked, he was angry.

Q. How many times did you look?

A. Several times.

Q. Two hours, couple times?

A. I don't know.

Q. And it's true, you dislike O.J. Simpson, don't you?

A. Dislike --

MR. KELLY: Objection. Relevance.

MR. BAKER: Goes to her bias, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. Dislike now, yes.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) And you certainly didn't appear nervous when you
were kissing him good-bye over -- my client being angry, did you?

A. You can kiss angry people.

Q. Okay.

Now, just one other area. And that is on the 8th -- you say on the 8th
-- did you learn that Mr. Simpson was out of town on the 8th, the day
of -- of Justin's graduation from -- what was it, preschool?

MR. KELLY: Objection.

A. Preschool --

MR. KELLY: Calls for hearsay.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. (Continuing.) I didn't know at the time.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Well, you intimated to this jury, that your daughter
was nervous and looking at a gate, correct?

A. Very.

Q. And you meant to imply that she was nervous, and looking at a gate
because she was concerned that Mr. Simpson might come in; that's what
you meant to imply to this jury, isn't it?

A. I would assume, yeah.

Q. And, in fact, your daughter, from what your information was, was
well aware that Mr. Simpson couldn't be there, and was on the other
coast of the United States of America; isn't that true?

A. Maybe she was hoping that he'd be at his son's graduation and
really surprise her.

Q. Well, maybe I'm -- I'm misunderstanding you.

Were you attempting to imply by the testimony you just gave this jury,
Ms. Brown, that she was nervous because she didn't want him to be
there, and now she wanted him to be there?

A. Well, I don't know --

Q. Thank you.

A. -- I don't know why she was nervous.

MR. BAKER: Nothing further.

REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. KELLY:

Q. Mrs. Brown, with regard to June 8, did Nicole ever indicate to you
that Mr. Simpson was not coming to that --

A. No.

Q. -- graduation?

Did she indicate to you that she thought he might be there.

MR. BAKER: Hearsay?

A. She --

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. (Continuing.) I just took it for granted that he was coming.

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) Did she indicate to you that she had let Mr.
Simpson's secretary, Kathy Randa, know about the graduation that day?

A. Yes, she did.

MR. BAKER: I object. Sheer speculation.

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) Did she --

THE COURT: Excuse me?

MR. BAKER: Just a minute.

THE COURT: I believe the area has been opened by the defense. You may
ask in the limited area.

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) And, in fact, Nicole indicated to you at one point,
that she was upset that Mr. Simpson had eventually not shown up,
because he had been notified; and she did think he was going to be
there, correct?

A. That's right.

Q. And she indicated she was upset not because of her, but because
Justin was, correct?

A. Exactly.

MR. KELLY: I have no further questions.

RECROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. BAKER:

Q. So it was your understanding, then, now, at this point in time in
your testimony, that Nicole was upset because he wasn't coming; is
that right?

A. Yes.

MR. BAKER: Thank you. Nothing further.

FURTHER REDIRECT EXAMINATION

BY MR. KELLY:

Q. And was it also your understanding that she was nervous that he may
be coming?

A. That he may be coming? Who knows?

MR. BAKER: Could -- Never mind. Nothing.

THE COURT: You may step down.

MR. BAKER: She is not excused, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Excuse me?

MR. BAKER: I don't want to excuse this witness in terms of the trial,
sir.

THE COURT: Okay.

You may step down.

MR. PETROCELLI: We wanted to approach momentarily before the last
witness.

(The following proceedings were held at the bench, with the reporter.)

MR. PETROCELLI: In lieu of my having to ask the witness and putting in
unnecessary documents, Mr. Baker stipulated with me that the amount of
funeral expenses paid is $7,961.40, so I don't have to get into that
in the examination.

THE COURT: This is as to Mr. Goldman?

MR. PETROCELLI: Yes.

THE COURT: Okay.

MR. PETROCELLI: We're ready to call our final witness.

My direct is probably around a half-hour. I don't want to interrupt
his direct, though, between a weekend break.

What do you think your cross is?

MR. BAKER: I don't know what -- it's probably 15, 20 minutes, 30
minutes.

MR. PETROCELLI: What is your pleasure?

THE COURT: My pleasure?

MR. PETROCELLI: It's a bad question.

Can we can we stay a little later and finish up today?

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, I want to do it the other way. I'm supposed to
be in Rancho Santa Fe at 7 o'clock. I mean . . .

MR. PETROCELLI: I'd prefer to get him off the stand.

MR. BAKER: He's not going to get off the stand, I don't think.

THE COURT: Well give me an idea of what you think. How much time?

MR. BAKER: Well, it depends on how much you limit me. I mean, my point
is --

THE COURT: You know me.

MR. PETROCELLI: We've got some --

MR. BAKER: -- I don't know what he's going to ask.

MR. PETROCELLI: I'm going to ask about the relationship between Fred
Goldman and Ron Goldman, background of Ron's life and the relationship
between the two.

THE COURT: It's 45 minutes to 4:30 and I don't want to unduly limit
cross-examination. So if you don't want to break up your direct
examination, I don't see how we could do anything but put it on
Monday.

MR. PETROCELLI: You don't have that much.

MR. BAKER: I do have some cross. You know I'm not going to limit my
cross. You guys have moved your witnesses in and out in the trial more
than any trial I've ever been in, and that's fine. I don't object to
that. But on the other hand -- Oh, come on. We've taken days off so
you can keep the order. That's never happened to in me in my life.

MR. PETROCELLI: Oh, Mr. Baker.

MR. BAKER: In any event, I don't want to limit my cross.

MR. PETROCELLI: If we go until 5:00, we'll finish it, we'll rest our
case, and start Monday morning.

MR. BAKER: Thank you very much for your courtesy.

No, I'm not going to agree to that.

THE COURT: Why don't you start Monday and you can complete it Monday
in one piece.

MR. PETROCELLI: Okay.

THE COURT: Otherwise, I'm going to have to split it up.

MR. PETROCELLI: I don't want to split it up.

THE COURT: Okay.

MR. PETROCELLI: Okay.

THE COURT: And the reason I do that is because it's not only an
inconvenience to our staff, but it's an inconvenience to the jury, and
everybody else. I don't think -- I don't think it would be helpful to
--

MR. PETROCELLI: Can you tell the jury we're going to call the final
witness Monday morning?

THE COURT: Yeah.

MR. PETROCELLI: Thank you.

(The following proceedings were held in open court, in the presence of
the jury.)

THE COURT: Ladies and gentlemen, because we're getting so close to the
end of the day, we're going to have the plaintiff call their final
witness Monday morning.

Okay. So let me remind you: Don't talk about the case among yourselves
or with anybody else. Don't form or express any opinions. Don't do any
research. Don't listen to any TV, radio, or read any stuff in the
media with regards to this case. Don't let anybody talk to you about
this case.

MR. PETROCELLI: Your Honor, for the record, our witness will be Fred
Goldman.

THE CLERK: Also, for the record --

THE COURT: See you Monday morning at 8:30.

THE CLERK: Also, for the record, Exhibit 25 is marked by reference to
the criminal trial.

THE COURT REPORTER: Thank you.

(At 3:50 P.M., an adjournment was taken until Monday, December 9,
1996, at 8:30 A.M.)

REPORTER'S DAILY TRANSCRIPT
DECEMBER 5, 1996

SUPERIOR COURT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA
FOR THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES

SHARON RUFO, ET AL., N/A, PLAINTIFFS,

VS.

ORENTHAL JAMES SIMPSON, ET AL., DEFENDANTS.


SANTA MONICA, CALIFORNIA
THURSDAY, DECEMBER 5, 1996
9:11 A.M.

DEPARTMENT NO. WEQ
HON. HIROSHI FUJISAKI, JUDGE

(REGINA D. CHAVEZ, OFFICIAL REPORTER)

(The following proceedings were held in open court, outside the
presence of the jury.)

THE COURT: Okay.

I believe we have Defendant's motion for reconsideration of the
Court's ruling regarding former testimony of Mark Fuhrman.

Go ahead.

MR. LEONARD: Your Honor, what prompted the filing of the motion was a
comment Your Honor made in the order, which suggests -- actually,
didn't suggest -- it actually stated that the only reason that we were
proposing to read the prior testimony of Detective Fuhrman was to try
to impeach him. And I thought we had made it fairly clear in our
earlier filing that that was not the only reason.

And the purpose for filing this motion -- and I understand that it's
an unusual procedure, but the purpose was simply to make it crystal
clear to Your Honor that that was not the only reason; and, in fact,
there were several other areas that we outlined in the motion that we
felt that his prior testimony was pertinent and -- and crucial to our
-- to our case. And I think we've outlined those fairly clearly.

We did attempt to articulate that in our earlier filings. Going back
through them, I thought we could have done a better job of that. I
wanted to make sure that Your Honor was aware of our position;
because, frankly, given what you stated in your order, I feel -- felt
like we didn't communicate that as clearly as we could to you.

So that's the main reason we wanted to do this official filing. So,
it's -- to the extent that your order and ruling was relying upon the
fact -- or ruling that that was the only reason that we were proposing
to call his testimony, we felt that that was incorrect. And then
again, that it was possibly primarily our fault, that we hadn't
articulated clearly enough the reasons, other than impeachment, that
we wanted to elicit the testimony of Detective Fuhrman.

THE COURT: Well, do I understand the Defendant's position to be that
the Defendant's counsel wish to offer Fuhrman's criminal-trial
testimony, and at the same time, impeach him?

MR. LEONARD: Yes, we do.

THE COURT: That's what I thought.

And do you wish to respond?

MR. GELBLUM: That was one of the points I wanted to make clear.

And the second is that Sections 1291 and 1292 make no distinction
whatsoever as to the purpose for what -- for which the evidence is
being used. It just says it can't be used if the party against them
being offered doesn't have an opportunity to cross-examine at the
prior trial.

MR. LEONARD: One final point.

If Your Honor was inclined to allow us to read in portions at this
juncture, or in our case to read in portions that were not
impeachment, but portions that we set forth, we'd be -- obviously,
we'll take half a loaf. We're not -- we don't want to do that, but we
will. And we'll argue at a later time, if it is appropriate, that we
were permitted to impeach. In response to your question.

MR. GELBLUM: Again, just -- the statute makes no distinction
whatsoever for the purpose for which the evidence is being offered.
None.

Because you can't offer it if the party against them is offered -- was
not a party to the prior action, and the party in the similar position
in the prior action did not have an opportunity to cross-examine,
which is clearly the case here, since the prosecution offered the
testimony, did not cross-examine the testimony.

Your prior ruling was absolutely correct in that regard and this --
the issue has no bearing on that whatsoever.

THE COURT: Well --

MR. LEONARD: Your Honor --

THE COURT: Yes?

MR. LEONARD: Would you like to hear any more? I mean, I think we've --

THE COURT: You want to make your record.

MR. LEONARD: I mean, we're now going -- we're now going back into the
arguments that were made before. And to the extent you want anymore
clarification, I'm willing to do that.

Obviously, I think we made our position very clear on this motion of
substance over form with regard to cross-examination, and you
apparently did not accept that.

I can revisit that at this point, if you'd like, I think.

THE COURT: I just want to give you the opportunity of clarifying the
record. I think the Court's ruling was a very technical one. It's a
position that, I think, by your current position -- position with
regards to taking half a loaf and foregoing the impeachment, would
stand you in good stead on the appeal.

I'm allowing you to perfect your record to that extent.

If I were sitting on a Court of Appeal, I would possibly be more
receptive to that argument, than just being a lowly trial judge.

MR. LEONARD: I'm not sure I understand what you're saying. Let me --

THE COURT: I'm letting you make your record with regards to the fact
that, by taking that position, perhaps the Court would say the
plaintiffs' position is more akin to that of the prosecutor than it
would be if it's your intention to impeach him, and offer the evidence
solely for the purposes of impeachment.

MR. LEONARD: Obviously, just so the record is clear, I --

THE COURT: Yeah.

MR. LEONARD: -- feel we're treading on delicate ground.

Just so the record is clear, I don't want my suggestion that we would
take half a loaf to, in any way, constitute a waiver of our initial
position. I want to you understand that.

That's not what I'm saying . . . I'm just saying that if Your Honor
were to -- were to modify his -- the ruling -- I mean, there's nothing
we can do about that.

But we wanted to make it perfectly clear that there are other reasons
beyond impeachment that we're offering the testimony. Again, that was
our desire to do that, was triggered by the -- what you stated in the
order, which I felt.

So that's our position. I don't want it construed as any type of a
waiver of our initial position.

Thank you, Your Honor.

THE COURT: I think I'm constrained to stay with the interpretation of
the Evidence Code Section 1292, as previously stated. Motion is
denied.

MR. PETROCELLI: Your Honor for scheduling purposes, today, after Randy
Petee concludes his testimony, we have three or four deposition
passages to be read into the record, and then that's all we have for
today. And some requests for admissions to be read to the jury.

Mr. Taft has been promised to me by the defense tomorrow morning. He
hasn't been available all week. So we will resume tomorrow morning,
with the Court's permission, with Bruce Weir, whose deposition is
being taken this afternoon, Skip Taft, and then members of the
victims' families.

THE COURT: Okay.

MR. PETROCELLI: Then we will be anticipating resting our case
tomorrow.

THE COURT: All right.

The Court's going to instruct the jury with regards to Nancy Ney's
testimony. I think as an oversight, yesterday, the Court should have
informed the jury that her testimony was being received for the
limited purpose that you offered it; that is, to show her state of
mind, with regards to her state of mind as to Mr. Simpson, and also to
explain her conduct with regards to what occurred at the recital prior
to the death.

MR. BAKER: We would object to that, Your Honor. I think that gives the
Court imprimatur that it was, in fact, Nicole Brown Simpson, and that
-- that the Court ought not do it.

I objected to that testimony before it ever came in, and we still do
object. We object to any of the preinstructions as attempting to cure
error.

THE COURT: Overruled. The jury is entitled to be advised that the
evidence is received for a limited purpose.

Bring the jury in.

(Pause in proceedings.)

(The jurors resumed their respective seats.)

(The following proceedings were held at the bench, with the reporter.)

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, as I indicated before, I object to any special
instruction. I object to paragraph 2 in its entirety, because I
believe that that paragraph (indicating to document handed to them
from the Court) is essentially putting the Court imprimatur on the
plaintiffs' argument.

I object to paragraph 3 in its entirety for the same reason.

And I object to the first sentence of paragraph 4.

I object to the entire instruction, but those, I think, argue the case
for the plaintiffs. And I think they're inappropriate to come from the
bench.

MR. PETROCELLI: I would object to the deletions suggested by Mr.
Baker.

I think this balances it out and explains to the jury the purpose for
which the evidence was offered. Otherwise, it looks like it's a
rejection of the entire testimony.

THE COURT: Well, the Court heard argument yesterday for the admission
of that evidence. That admission was received solely on the basis of
state of mind of the decedent.

The Court reviewed the Ortiz case and was satisfied that if they
allowed that in a criminal case, I think it's allowable in a civil
case.

I'm satisfied that this instruction informs the jury of the limited
purpose for which this evidence is being received, and that the Court
has no belief as to the efficacy of the testimony.

That's a matter strictly for the jury, so I'll give it.

MR. BAKER: Judge, one other point.

What conduct -- what possible conduct of Nicole Brown Simpson could be
relevant in this case?

THE COURT: The conduct with regards to her treatment, allegedly, of
Mr. Simpson and at the recital and after the recital, and not inviting
him to dinner, et cetera, to show her state of mind was not one of
seeking reconciliation; that the defendant -- I believe defense
evidence, defense examination of Mr. Simpson, tended to imply that
there was -- that it was otherwise. And I believe that this evidence
may be received when proffered by the plaintiff to counter that.

(Pause in proceedings.)

(The following proceedings were held in open court, in the presence of
the jury.)

THE COURT: Morning, ladies and gentlemen.

Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, you will recall the testimony of
Nancy Ney, the woman from the Sojourn House, who testified about a
telephone call.

The testimony of Nancy Ney of a telephone call from Nicole was
received into evidence for the limited purpose -- for a limited
purpose, and cannot be considered by the jury for any other purpose.

It has been contended variously that Nicole Brown Simpson was trying
to get back together with Mr. Simpson; that she was fearful of him, or
that did not want to reconcile with him; or that she had a state of
mind that was one way or another at different times.

The testimony of Nancy Ney, of the Sojourn House, about the telephone
call was offered by the plaintiff to show Nicole's state of mind
regarding the relationship at the time the call was made, and to
explain her conduct as it may relate to Mr. Simpson at the recital the
night of her death.

This testimony is received only to show her state of mind, and to
explain her conduct.

The jury must not consider the substance of her statement to Nancy as
evidence of any event or whether such event occurred.

The testimony is not evidence of any state of mind, intent, or acts
attributable to Mr. Simpson, and cannot be considered by the jury for
such purpose.

By giving you this instruction, the Court is not implying that Nancy
Ney's testimony proves that the caller, Nicole, was, in fact, Nicole
Brown Simpson. That is a determination that is solely and exclusively
for you to make, after weighing and considering all of the evidence.

Jurors, you understand what I just said to you?

JURORS: Yes, sir.

THE COURT: That the substance of the telephone conversation -- you
cannot consider whether they were real, truthful, or anything. You may
only consider the telephone conversation as it may show what the
caller's state of mind was at that time or about that time.

Everybody understand that?

JURORS: (Nod affirmatively.)

THE COURT: Okay. Thank you.

RANDALL R. PETEE, the witness on the stand at the time of the
adjournment on Wedensday, December 4, 1996, having been previously
duly sworn, was examined and testified further as follows:

THE CLERK: You are still under oath.

And would you please state your name again for the record.

THE WITNESS: Randall R. Petee.

CROSS-EXAMINATION (Continued) BY MR. BAKER:

Q. Mr. Petee, you brought with you the instructions that you received,
I guess, on November 27, 1996 from the Law Offices of Mitchell,
Silberberberg & Knupp.

A. Yes.

Q. And you received also, I take, it besides these written
instructions. Do you have those in front of you?

A. Yes.

Q. Next in order is 2229?

THE CLERK: 2228.

MR. GELBLUM: No, 9.

MR. BAKER: I think 2228.

THE CLERK: You're right.

(The instrument herein referred to as Copy of a fax dated November 27,
1996 was marked for identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 2229.)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You also received oral instructions besides the
written instructions, 2229, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And the oral instructions you received indicated -- strike that.

Who gave you these oral instructions for this event that you entered
into Sunday night?

A. I spoke with Mr. Gelblum and I spoke with Mr. Foster.

Q. Your written instructions didn't include --

MR. BAKER: Well, pull it up to the top, will you, Phil.

(Indicating to Exhibit 2229 on the Elmo screen.)

Q. It says November 27, 1996. 10:43. It says the fifth and Petrocelli.

Did you ever speak to Mr. Petrocelli about this?

A. No.

Q. It was last Wednesday that you received this fax?

A. That's correct.

Q. And before you received the fax, did you have a phone conversation
with Mr. Gelblum and Mr. Foster?

A. I believe I had spoke with Mr. Gelblum.

Q. All right.

And did he tell you that you were to make two trips on each one of the
routes set forth in the document?

MR. BAKER: You can back it up a little bit, Phil, 2229.

A. With Mr. Gelblum?

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Yes, sir.

A. No.

Q. So when you got this document, you didn't know you were to make one
trip at the speed limit and then another trip where you'd go as fast
as 60 miles an hour on San Vicente?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Who told you that?

A. Mr. Foster.

Q. Oh, you spoke with Mr. Foster first?

A. No.

Q. Well, tell me what Mr. Foster told you to do.

Did he tell you time was of the essence in this case?

A. No, he did not say that.

Q. Did he tell you he needed you to get -- as fast as you could, get
from 875 South Bundy to 360 North Rockingham, and not go down Ashford,
or words to that effect?

A. We discussed that I was to do these routes in an accelerated but
reasonable speed.

Q. Now, maybe you didn't understand my question.

My question was, did Mr. Foster tell you that you were to try to get
from 875 South Bundy to 360 North Rockingham as quickly as you could
because time was extremely important in this case, or words to that
effect?

A. He did not say that time was of the essence.

Q. Well, certainly you knew, from being at Grailey and Associates with
the other former LAPD officers who investigated this case as a
criminal case, as well as investigated this case as a civil case, that
time line was crucial, correct?

A. I just completed the assignment.

Q. I didn't ask you what you completed. I asked you whether or not you
knew, because your co-workers, as well as yourself, have been employed
by the Mitchell, Silberberg firm, and you knew that time and time line
was of the essence, before you ever got this assignment. Isn't that
true, sir?

A. That I knew that?

Q. Yes, sir; that you knew that before you got in your car on Sunday
night, December 2, first -- and started this exercise that you have
described here.

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. Vague, time of the essence, time is of the
essence. I'm not sure what that means. He was told to drive it in
time.

MR. BAKER: Well, I object.

THE COURT: Excuse me. Objection's overruled.

Defense may inquire as to the state of mind of this witness as he
carried out his assignment.

MR. BAKER: May the court reporter read the question and the witness be
directed to answer?

THE COURT: Yes.

You can't remember it?

MR. BAKER: I can remember it.

THE COURT: Be faster if you just restated it, Mr. Baker.

MR. BAKER: It's tough to remember even the last question at my age.

(Laughter.)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, by the way, I wore this tie for you, Mr. Petee:
Got a lot of clocks on it.

(Laughter.)

A. Thank you.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, you were well aware, before you started your
car to complete this assignment on December 1, 1996, that time was
crucial in the success of this case if the plaintiffs are to prevail,
and that is the time that anybody can get from 875 South Bundy to 360
North Rockingham, correct?

A. I was aware of that part of the investigation.

Q. And unaware that it was crucial, correct, sir? That is, the elapsed
time from 875 South Bundy to 360 Rockingham, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And you were told, for example, that in the Avondale run, that you
were supposed to make a left turn before you slowed down, enough so
you'd safely be able to make a turn without having made the tires of a
Bronco squeal, or without drawing attention of others possibly around.

That's what you were told; you were supposed to go as fast as you
could, without making the tires squeal, right?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. Misstates what the document says.

MR. BAKER: I'm asking a question, Your Honor.

MR. GELBLUM: It doesn't say "as fast as you can."

MR. BAKER: You know, I can read. I can also ask a question.

I would appreciate it if he has an objection, that he state the legal
objection, instead of arguing.

THE COURT: Same objection. The document doesn't ask what you state.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You were told to go as fast as you could, without
squealing the tires, right?

A. No.

Q. Mr. -- you have no instructions on there about making two trips,
right?

A. That's correct.

Q. And those instructions were, of course, given to you before you got
the written instructions that you were going to make the two trips,
correct?

A. I'm not sure.

Q. Let me see if I've got the time frame straight. And that is, you
talked to Foster before -- Mr. Steve Foster before you got this
memorandum, 2229?

MR. PETROCELLI: 1129.

MR. GELBLUM: That's the exhibit number.

MR. PETROCELLI: Oh, I'm sorry. I'm referring to the date. Excuse me.

A. I don't recall if I talked to him before I received the document or
after.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, in terms of your conversation with Mr. Foster,
did you then tell him this is not the quickest way to get to -- from
875 South Bundy to 360 North Rockingham?

A. No.

Q. Well, you knew time was crucial; and you knew that you were told to
go a certain route; that is, have your car parked headed east on
Dorothy, then go south to the first street that you could turn on, and
then go up Gretna Green, correct, so you're going south, and then
turning around and heading straight north. You did that, did you not?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. This was all covered yesterday. Asked and
answered.

MR. BAKER: No, it was objected to.

THE COURT: See if you can complete this.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) In any event, you talked to Mr. Gelblum, you talked
to Mr. Foster. You looked at 228 or 229 [sic], the instructions, and
you went out there and you made two runs. And you tried to do it on
the second run as fast as you could do it, because you knew time was
crucial, correct?

A. I could have done it faster than what I've done.

Q. And you also knew that if you were going to get -- you were in a
hurry to get from 875 South Bundy to 360 North Rockingham, you would
not go south on Bundy, didn't you, sir?

A. Did I know that?

Q. Yes.

A. No.

Q. You thought that would probably be the most direct route, to go
north? You first start south; is that what you thought?

A. I followed the assignment.

MR. BAKER: Thank you. Nothing further.

REDIRECT EXAMINATION. BY MR. GELBLUM:

Q. Mr. Petee, you -- did you have anything to do with connecting the
routes?

A. No.

Q. You were given the assignment and you completed the assignment?

A. That's correct.

Q. Thank you. Thank you.

THE COURT: Step down.

(The witness complies.)

MR. GELBLUM: Your Honor, I'd like to move in 2227, 2228 and 2229.

(The instrument herein described was Received in evidence as
Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 2227.)

(The instrument herein described was Received in evidence as
Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 2228.)

(The instrument herein described was Received in evidence as
Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 2229.)

THE COURT: Proceed.

MR. GELBLUM: Next, Your Honor, we're going to read the deposition of
Lenore Walker, selected portions of that.

MR. GELBLUM: Ms. Molinaro is going to read the answers.

MR. GELBLUM: She may have been accidentally omitted from the list. I
apologize.

MR. LEONARD: Oh.

MR. BAKER: I think we have to wait three days, according to rules.

MR. PETROCELLI: That only applies to video depositions.

MR. BAKER: That only applies to us.

THE COURT: Okay.

MR. LEONARD: They always want --

(Selected portions of the deposition of Dr. Lenore E. A. Walker were
read by Plaintiffs' Counsel, Mr. Gelblum reading the questions, and
Ms. Molinaro reading the answers.)

MR. GELBLUM: Page 7, lines 10 to 12.

(Reading:)

Q. Could you state your full name for the record, please.

A. Doctor Lenore A. Walker.

MR. GELBLUM: Page 8, lines 1 to 4.

(Reading:)

Q. Okay. Have you been retained by Defendant, Orenthal James Simpson
or his attorneys, in this case to render one or more opinions?

A. Yes, I have.

MR. GELBLUM: Page 8 lines 15 to 22.

Q. And you, of course, worked on the criminal case, correct?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Again, for the defense?

A. Yes.

Q. When were you first contacted do work in the criminal case?

A. In August of 1994.

MR. GELBLUM: Page 8, lines -- I'm sorry. Page 9, line 23, to page 10,
line 10.

(Reading:)

Q. About how many hours have you worked on this case?

A. Maybe somewhere between 30 and 40. I am not sure.

Q. And how many hours did you work in the criminal case?

A. Many, many more. I don't even have an estimate right now.

I know I spent about 60 hours with Mr. Simpson, himself, and then, I
just don't even have an estimate of how many hours of reading
materials.

Q. More than a hundred?

A. Oh, yeah.

MR. GELBLUM: Page 11, lines 6 to 10.

(Reading:)

Q. And you personally spent about 60 hours with Mr. Simpson?

A. About that.

Q. That was all in jail?

A. Yes.

MR. GELBLUM: Page 172, line 6 --

MR. LEONARD: Hold on.

MR. GELBLUM: -- to page 174, line 20.

(Reading:)

Q. Dr. Walker, I'm going to show you what we'll mark as exhibit 4.

MR. GELBLUM: And, Your Honor, if I may -- these are -- I'm not going
to actually hand these to Ms. Molinaro. These exhibits -- these are
exhibits that are Dr. Walker's notes that have been turned into trial
exhibits, we've been marking. We've shown them to Mr. Leonard already,
portions -- the portions that Mr. Petrocelli referred to in his
examination of Mr. Simpson, and they are portions of trial exhibits
1994, 8 and 1950.

Just to authenticate them, I'm going to read through this whole
passage here.

(Reading:)

Q. Is this a copy of your handwritten notes from interviews -- from
interviewing Mr. Simpson?

A. And then type edited.

Q. And then typed up and edited, the handwritten notes.

Is the date on the first page, January 7, 1995, the date of the
interview?

A. Yes.

MR. GELBLUM: And that's Trial Exhibit 1948, a portion of 1948. That is
Exhibit 4.

(Reading:)

Q. Did you write down everything Mr. Simpson said during the
interview?

A. No. As much as I could.

Q. As much as you could?

A. Yes.

Q. You didn't select out as you were going through?

A. No. Sometimes, if something got very emotional, I just couldn't
write it down. Or if he got very loud or very fast, I couldn't write
it down.

Q. But you tried to write down as much as you could?

A. Yes.

Q. And in your -- and then your transcription in the typed version is
that trying to fill in some of the gaps?

A. I tried to fill in some of the gaps that I could remember.

Q. Were the typewritten notes prepared in relation to when the
handwritten notes were made?

A. I don't know. It was during the -- still during the pendency of the
criminal trial, before it was decided whether I would or would not
testify, so I don't know exactly when.

Q. Exhibit 5. Is Exhibit 5 a copy of your handwritten and then
transcribed notes of your interview of Mr. Simpson on January 8, 1995?

A. Yes.

Q. Is Exhibit 6 a copy of your handwritten and typed notes of your
interview with Mr. Simpson on February 26, 1995?

A. Yes.

Q. Is Exhibit 7 a copy of your handwritten notes and typed-up notes of
your interview with Mr. Simpson on February 25, 1995?

A. Yes.

Q. Is Exhibit A a copy of your handwritten, and then still --

A. Unedited.

Q. -- unedited but typed-up version of your notes with your interview
with Mr. Simpson on May 7, 1995?

A. Yes.

Q. And is Exhibit 9 a copy of your handwritten and still unedited
typed-up notes of your interview with Mr. Simpson on May 6, 1995?

A. Yes.

MR. GELBLUM: Page 175, line 18, page 176, line 24.

(Reading:)

Q. Did you tape-record any of these interviews?

A. Some of them were tape-recorded when she wasn't present, but they
were destroyed when -- once we listened to the tapes together and
decided that we were going to -- just talk about what we were -- she
did a couple that I didn't do, and I did a couple that she didn't do.

Q. That's Dr. Stahly?

A. Yes.

Q. And why did you destroy the tapes?

A. Because we didn't need them anymore. We just did it so that the
other person could listen to it.

Q. Is that your normal practice when you're working as an expert
witness, to destroy tape-recordings of interviews you've done?

A. I rarely tape-record. And when I do tape-record, I usually don't
keep them.

Q. Why is that?

A. Because they are usually unnecessary. My notes are usually all I
need.

Q. Do you check your notes against the tape recordings when you're
preparing the typewritten version?

A. Sometimes I do. In this case, I didn't.

Q. Why not?

A. Because I didn't think I needed to.

Q. Why not?

A. Because my notes seemed, to me, to be pretty complete when we went
over and listened to the ones we did.

MR. GELBLUM: Page 315, line 13, to 316, line 14.

(Reading:)

A. The closest to what Mr. Simpson said would be in the handwritten
notes. So if there's a discrepancy, the handwritten notes are the
accurate ones. But even in the handwritten notes, I'm trying to take
notes as Mr. Simpson is talking, and sometimes I transcribe a word
that would be closest to his.

Q. I'm going to see if I can find it really quickly. While I do, let
me make sure I understand the notes. All the notes you gave me, that's
Exhibits 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 --

A. Your numbers don't mean anything to me. I know they do for the
record, but I don't have them.

Q. Look at Mr. --

MR. LEONARD: Leonard.

Q. (BY MR. GELBLUM) -- Leonard's 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 --

A. Yes.

Q. -- my question is, the handwritten portions of those are all in
your handwriting?

A. That's correct.

Q. Those are all your handwritten notes that you made
contemporaneously as Mr. Simpson was speaking with you?

A. That's correct.

Q. You were trying to write down as much as possible what he said?

A. That's correct.

MR. GELBLUM: Page 317, lines 9 to 19.

(Reading:)

Q. You were doing this as part your job as a consultant for the
defense --

A. Yes.

Q. -- in the criminal case?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, the typed versions, the typed portions of Exhibits 4 through
9, the intent was to accurately transcribe the handwritten notes; is
that correct?

A. I suppose accurately was part of the intent, but it was very -- the
intent was to transcribe the handwritten notes as accurately as
possible.

MR. GELBLUM: And finally, page 378, line 20, to page 379, line 12.
(Reading:)

Q. On page 19, the third entry starts, Kato comes in. Do you see that
on page 19?

A. Yes.

Q. Then the last sentence says, Maybe out of town or a little --

I'm sorry. The last two sentences,

Paula out and about; maybe out of town or a little upset about
inviting her.

Do you see that?

A. Yes.

Q. Would you look at the notes -- meaning the handwritten notes?

It's page 42. I believe it says, Maybe out of town or a little upset
about not inviting her.

A. That's correct.

Q. Meaning Paula was a little upset about not being invited to the
recital?

A. He didn't know that for sure, but he made -- he thought maybe that
was why he hadn't talked with her, or that maybe she would have been.
But he didn't know that for sure.

MR. GELBLUM: That's all from Dr. Walker's deposition. Would you like
--

MR. LEONARD: I just now noticed -- I think there's something I'd like
to read. We can discuss it very quickly, if I can have a minute.

MR. PETROCELLI: Is it within the scope?

MR. GELBLUM: Yes.

MR. LEONARD: I have one reading.

MR. LEONARD: (Reading:)

Q. Good morning, Dr. Walker.

A. Good morning.

MS. MOLINARO: Something Mr. Gelblum didn't read?

Excuse me, sir; I need a page and line reference.

MR. LEONARD: Page 316, line 15.

MS. MOLINARO: Okay.

MR. LEONARD: (Reading:)

Q. Were you just writing down what you considered to be significant?

A. Yes. Or what I could get.

I mean, sometimes it wasn't significant, but I would just be writing.
I wouldn't even have a chance to think about whether it was
significant or not. But sometimes something significant would happen,
but I couldn't write a lot because I was attending to the
psychological piece of the significance.

Q. But you were trying to write down just what you considered to be
significant, correct? You didn't always succeed in that, as you just
said, but that was your attempt?

A. Well, that's not fair, because there are lots of things I wrote
down that have no significance whatsoever. So I tried to write down
enough so that I would -- so it would jar my memory of what we talked
about.

I had no idea when we started out that it was going to be as copious
as it was.

MR. LEONARD: Thank you.

MR. GELBLUM: Your Honor, I'd just like to offer the portions of the
notes, as I referred to before.

And what we've done, we've put together the redacted versions of
typewritten portions and the corresponding handwritten portions with
respect to the notes.

We've given these to defense previously, and I think the marking is
next in order, as opposed to 1994 and 1950.

THE CLERK: That's fine. Next in order is 2230.

MR. GELBLUM: I would offer those.

MR. LEONARD: The only -- we have no objection, but we reserve the
right in our case to put in portions that we find significant and
pertinent.

MR. GELBLUM: Sir --

THE COURT: Yes?

MR. LEONARD: Subject to the Court's ruling.

THE COURT: Received.

(The instrument herein referred to as Portions of deposition of Lenore
A. Walker which were read into the record by Plaintiffs' counsel were
marked for identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 2230, and
received in evidence.)

MR. PETROCELLI: We have three other witnesses to do by deposition.
Would this be a good time for the morning recess?

THE COURT: So soon?

MR. PETROCELLI: The next one is the longest one; then we have two
short ones.

THE COURT: How long is the long one?

MR. PETROCELLI: Probably half an hour.

THE COURT: Why don't you do it.

MR. PETROCELLI: Jim Merrill.

MR. LEONARD: Can we approach just briefly?

THE COURT REPORTER: With the reporter?

MR. LEONARD: No, I don't think we need the reporter. (A bench
conference was held which was not reported.)

(The following proceedings were held in open court, in the presence of
the jury.)

THE COURT: Ladies and gentlemen, at this part of the trial, the
plaintiff is going to offer into evidence, parts of the testimony of a
witness whose deposition was videotaped. Because in a trial, the
plaintiff has they're parts of the case they want to put on, there are
certain parts of the deposition they feel is germane to their case, so
they want to put that part on at this time.

The defense has their part that they think is germane to their
defense, and they want to put that on.

Because in this instance, and perhaps in some of the other
depositions, we will find that the deposition was videotaped, but for
reasons of presentation of the evidence in terms of the way -- the
segmented way that they want to present it, at this point, they are
going to offer -- Plaintiff is going to offer reading of the
deposition as it had been written. They're going to read it, and the
defense is going to offer a portion of the deposition testimony that
was also going to be read.

And then when the plaintiff finishes their case, the defense may put
on the videotape of the rest of the deposition or those parts that
they want to put on as part of their defense, which the plaintiff is
not interested in putting on in their part.

So you may hear part of the deposition testimony through the medium of
attorneys reading the transcript at this stage. Later on, you may hear
and see parts of that same witness's deposition in real form.

I want to explain what is happening, so you won't be confused.

Have I confused you?

(Laughter.)

MR. LEONARD: Thank you, Your Honor.

MR. PETROCELLI: Thank you very much, Your Honor.

MR. PETROCELLI: Page five.

MR. PETROCELLI: Page 7, line 10.

(Reading:)

Q. Where did you -- And where did you go to pick up Mr. Simpson?

MR. PETROCELLI: Page 9, line 2. (Reading:)

claim?

A. Right.

Q. How much time did you spend in the baggage claim area with Mr.

Q. And where did you -- where were you and Mr. Simpson during that 15
minutes?

A. When we were in the baggage claim area?

Q. Yes.

A. We proceeded down the corridor, got in the baggage claim area and
sat down on a bench, bench seat just in front of the baggage claim
area to the right of where the bags were coming.

MR. PETROCELLI: Page 52, line 2. (Reading:)

Q. You and he were sitting on the bench, right? Correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And it became apparent when the luggage from the airplane started
to come out onto the carousel, right?

A. Yes.

Q. Because you saw the carousel starting to turn around, right?

A. Yes.

Q. And luggage started coming down, right?

A. Yep.

Q. At that moment, Mr. Simpson got up, right?

A. Yes.

Q. And he walked over without asking you for permission, right?

A. Yes.

Q. And he didn't say to you, you know, Jim, come with me and we'll get
my luggage, right?

A. Yes.

Q. He just got up and he went to that carousel leaving you behind
without saying a word to you, true?

A. Well, he said, "I'm going to get my golf bags -- my golf bag."

MR. BAKER: Can we get page and lines, since we don't have this?

MR. PETROCELLI: Page 52.

MR. BAKER: You're skipping a bunch.

MR. LEONARD: We've got no designation.

MR. PETROCELLI: I'm not skipping anything.

MR. LEONARD: Slow down a little bit.

MR. BAKER: Give us a page when you're skipping.

MR. LEONARD: I don't mind not having the designation; I'd like to him
slow down.

MR. PETROCELLI: Page 53. I started at 52, line 8.

We'll pick up again at page 53, line 1. (Reading:)

Q. He just got up and went to that carousel leaving you behind without
saying a word to you, true?

A. Well, he said I'm going to get my golf bags -- my golf bag.

Q. Okay. He said, "I'm going to get my golf bag," correct?

A. Right.

Q. And you waited there, right?

A. Yes.

Q. He didn't ask you to come along with him, right?

A. No.

Q. And he went to the carousel and he -- How long was he at the
carousel?

A. Maybe two minutes.

Q. And during the two minutes that Mr. Simpson was at the carousel,
that entire time you were sitting down at the bench, right?

A. That's correct.

Q. And you were watching the suit bag with the OJS initials on it,
correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And the black duffel bag?

A. That's correct.

Q. Two minutes or so later Mr. Simpson returned?

A. Right.

Q. And when he returned he was duffle, carrying a golf bag, right?

A. Right.

Q. Now, when we talk about a golf bag, he was carrying in actuality a
golf bag covered in a travel bag, right?

A. Correct.

Q. You couldn't see the actual clubs, right?

A. No.

Q. Could you see Mr. Simpson during the entire time he was waiting for
the golf clubs?

A. He was in sight, yes.

Q. Were you looking at him the entire time?

A. I'm sure I -- I wasn't staring at him.

Q. You can't say here then that that entire time that he was standing
there waiting to get his golf clubs that you were -- you had your eyes
peered on him, right?

A. Right.

Q. So you weren't staring at him the whole time, correct?

A. Correct.

MR. PETROCELLI: Page 60, Mr. Leonard, line 11. (Reading:)

Q. When you got in the car, you said that the golf clubs went in the
trunk, right?

A. That's correct.

MR. PETROCELLI: Next page, Mr. Leonard, page 62, starting at line 19.

MR. LEONARD: Please give me a second. You haven't -- you haven't given
designations. Give me a second.

What line? What line?

MR. PETROCELLI: Line 19.

MR. LEONARD: Thanks.

MR. PETROCELLI: (Reading:)

Q. Was there any discussion in the car ride to the airport about
additional arrangements concerning Mr. Simpson?

A. In regards to the golf outing?

Q. Yes.

A. Yes.

Q. And you and he discussed that you would be available to take him to
the golf tournament?

A. Yes.

Q. Had that been prearranged, by the way?

A. Yes.

MR. PETROCELLI: Page 64, line 4, Mr. Leonard. (Reading:)

Q. So when you and Mr. Simpson were discussing arrangements to get him
to the golf course while you were driving him to the hotel, you then
told him that you would be responsible for taking him to the course?

A. Yes.

MR. PETROCELLI: Page 65, line 12. (Reading:)

Q. Didn't he tell you that he wanted to be able to reach you after you
dropped him off at airport -- at the hotel?

A. I'm sure he made mention of it, yes, sure.

Q. And you explained to him how he could reach you, right?

A. Yes.

Q. And you did so by giving him two phone numbers, right?

A. That's correct. Actually, three.

Q. You gave him three phone numbers?

A. That's correct.

Q. You gave him your home number, right?

A. That's correct.

Q. You gave him your cell phone number?

A. That's correct.

Q. And what's the third number?

A. It was on my business card. It's my office number as well.

Q. And which number did you tell him to use?

A. I believe I told him that the easiest way to get in touch with me
would be through the cellular phone.

MR. PETROCELLI: Page 67, line 2. (Reading:)

Q. Did you and he discuss approximately what time you would come back
to pick him up?

A. Within a range, yes.

Q. What was that?

A. I was looking, if I recall correctly. For departure of around 11:30
at the hotel.

Q. To arrive at the golf course by when?

A. By noon.

MR. PETROCELLI: Page 69, line 2 -- line 22. (Reading:)

Q. When you went into the hotel with Mr. Simpson, you parked right in
front of the hotel?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. And did you go out to get the golf clubs, to open the trunk to get
the golf clubs?

A. I don't recall doing that. I recall getting out of the car and
walking straight to the lobby. And we had a discussion on the -- about
the golf clubs.

Q. What was that discussion?

A. Just basically that we were going to be getting back together later
that morning and that it would be simpler to leave the clubs in my
possession.

Q. So when Mr. Simpson left your car that morning, he left the clubs
with you in the car, right?

A. Yes.

Q. And based on your conversation with him, you and he had discussed
that those clubs would remain in your care, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. And that you would be coming back to get him, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. With the clubs, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. Did Mr. Simpson ask you where you lived or where you were going?

A. No.

Q. Did you tell him that you were going home, though?

A. Yes.

Q. And that's why you gave him the home number, right?

A. That's right.

Q. So based on the understanding that you made with him when you left
him at the hotel, you were going to go back home, wait for his phone
call, then come back, right?

A. Or call him. One way or another, we were going to get in touch and
coordinate later that morning.

MR. PETROCELLI: Page 72, Mr. Leonard, line 3. (Reading:)

Q. During the time you conversed with Mr. Simpson that entire morning,
did he talk at all about Nicole, his ex-wife?

A. Yes.

Q. What did he say?

A. We add brief discussion about what he was doing the day before.
Actually I couldn't understand why he took a late flight out.

Q. You asked him why he took a late flight out?

A. Right.

Q. And what did he say?

A. He said that he wanted to go to his daughter's recital, dance
recital, that he had been working on a lot of projects lately that
have been taking up a lot of his time and that Nicole was on him about
not spending time with the children, was basically giving him a hard
time about that.

Q. Now, this is the first time you ever spoke to Mr. Simpson, right?

A. Yes.

Q. And he told you all of that?

A. In a couple brief sentences, yes.

MR. PETROCELLI: Page 74, line 1. (Reading:)

Q. Now, when you picked him up at the airport, he was -- you recall
what he was wearing?

A. Yes, I do.

Q. And what was that?

A. I recall blue jeans with a blue jean shirt, loafers, some sort of
loafer shoe, black loafers I recall.

Q. And no socks, correct?

A. Did not remember seeing any socks.

Q. When you went inside the hotel, Mr. Simpson went right to the front
desk?

A. We both did, yes.

MR. PETROCELLI: Page 76, Mr. Leonard, line 2. (Reading:)

Q. Do you know whether someone took his bags up to the room for him?

A. I do not recall. I recall him walking towards the elevator, and
that was the end of that.

Q. Now, the next morning -- First of all, you drove right back to your
house, right?

A. Yes, straight to my house.

Q. Did you stop anyplace?

A. No.

Q. Did you ever take the clubs out of the trunk?

A. No, surprisingly.

Q. Why surprisingly?

A. Well, just afterwards speculating what kind of clubs, he played
with, things of that nature.

No, I never looked at the clubs.

MR. PETROCELLI: Page 77, Mr. Leonard, line 6. (Reading:)

Q. And at some point you got a phone call, right?

A. Yes.

Q. And the first phone call you got that morning was from Mr. Simpson?

A. That's correct.

Q. And it was on your cell phone?

A. On my cellular phone.

Q. And you're sure of that?

A. I'm positive.

MR. PETROCELLI: And, Mr. Leonard, page 79, line 5. (Reading:)

Q. Now, in this first telephone call, it came in from Mr. Simpson's
hotel room, as you understand it?

A. Yes.

Q. And I'm looking at his telephone bill from his hotel room which has
been previously marked as Exhibit 72 to these depositions, and it
shows a call to (708)337-4150. That was your cell phone number, right?

A. Yes.

Q. And it shows three calls to that number, and all three were to your
cell phone, correct?

A. Take that's correct.

Q. In any of those three phone calls to your -- to you made by Mr.
Simpson from his hotel room, did he mention to you anything about
cutting his finger?

A. Not -- No.

Q. Later on he did?

A. No, no. I believe it was the third conversation when I heard a
crash. He didn't say anything about cutting his finger. That was when
he proceeded to start crying.

Q. And the crash that you heard is kind of like glass breaking?

A. I heard a disturbance in the background. I can't tell you whether
it was glass breaking or not.

Q. Did you ask him if everything was okay?

A. I didn't even address that noise.

Q. But this was the conversation in which Mr. Simpson apparently put
the phone down, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. And it was at that point in time that you heard this crash,
correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And then some time elapsed and then he picked up the phone again,
correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. And how long of a time do you think went by when the phone was laid
down by Mr. Simpson and you were out of contact with him on the cell
phone call?

A. Oh, boy. It was very brief.

Q. Ten seconds?

A. Not even that.

Q. Five seconds?

A. Two to five seconds.

Q. Two to five seconds?

A. Right. And the crash that I heard could have been the phone hitting
something. I can't tell what you what it was.

Q. Well, you said crash?

A. Well, the noise that I heard.

Q. Could it also have been glass breaking?

A. It could have been anything.

Q. Any conversation in that call about his finger?

A. No.

Q. Or a cut on his finger?

A. No.

Q. Or in any of those calls?

A. No.

Q. Now, in these three phone calls that Mr. Simpson made from his
phone -- room to you and your cell phone, did he at any time discuss
wanting to get you to pick him up and get his golf clubs and go back
to Los Angeles?

A. None of the conversations addressed the golf clubs. They all --

Q. But he wanted you to come, right?

A. As quickly as I could, yes.

Q. And in the very first conversation, did you point out that you were
roughly 30, 40 minutes from his hotel?

A. No, I did not.

Q. Did you tell him when you would be there? Did you say I'll be there
in two minutes or I'll be there in a half-hour?

A. No.

Q. You're saying that you did not at all make clear to Mr. Simpson how
long it would take for you to get there?

A. Not on the first conversation.

Q. But you did in one of the other two conversations?

A. Yes.

Q. In the second one?

A. Yes.

Q. And what did you tell him in the second one?

A. I just let him know that I was a good dance away from where he was
that it would take me some time, that there may be better alternatives
out there for him to get back to the airport.

Q. And he said to you try to make it, right?

A. Yes. I told him that I would try to get there.

Q. And he did not tell you not to come, right?

A. No.

Q. In fact, the way he left it with you after that second call is that
even though you were quite a ways away, you were still going to try to
pick him up at the airport, right?

A. At the hotel.

Q. Excuse me. That you were still going to try to pick him up at the
hotel and get him to the airport, right?

A. Yes.

Q. And then in the third call he made to you he again indicated to you
that he wanted you to get there as quickly as possible?

A. Yes. He was wondering where I was and just wondering when I was
going to be there.

MR. PETROCELLI: Page 85, Mr. Leonard, line 10. (Reading:)

Q. According to the time listed on your phone records, the first call
was received on your cell phone on it's morning of June 13 at what
time?

A. 8:25 a.m.

Q. 8:25?

A. That's correct.

MR. PETROCELLI: Going down to line 22. (Reading:)

Q. Okay. The next call that you received from Mr.1Simpson by looking
at your cell phone records took place when?

A. 8:32 a.m.

Q. So that was seven minutes later?

A. That's correct.

Q. And that's the call when you told him about maybe he should take
alternative transportation because you were quite a distance away,
correct?

A. That's right.

Q. But he still had said -- excuse me -- but he still said he wanted
you to come get him, right?

A. That's correct.

Q. Then the next call that came in was at what time?

A. 8:34 a.m.

Q. Two minutes later?

A. Two minutes later.

Q. And same thing discussed in that call?

A. Right. And that's when I addressed the issue of his behavior at
that time.

Q. What do you mean?

A. Well, he seemed very -- even more desperate at that point.

Q. And that's when the phone dropped?

A. Yes.

Q. And you again brought up the subject in that third call that
perhaps he should take a cab or some other alternative transportation,
right?

A. Yes.

Q. And he did not tell you to stop coming to the airport in that third
call, right?

A. No, he did not.

Q. In fact, the way it was left is that you were still going to try to
get him, right?

A. That's right.

Q. Now, you then called him shortly thereafter, right?

A. Correct.

Q. You called the hotel?

A. That's correct.

Q. And somehow by getting in touch with the front desk were
transferred to Mr. Simpson, right?

A. That's correct.

Q. And first you called directory assistance to get the phone number,
right?

A. That's correct.

Q. That's indicated on your cell phone records, right?

A. Right.

Q. And you did that at 8:47 a.m., which is 13 minutes after your phone
call -- your third phone call with Mr. Simpson, true?

A. That's right.

Q. And then you got the number and then you called the hotel, right?

A. That's correct.

Q. And you called the hotel at what time?

A. According to the records, 8:48 a.m.

Q. And it took a little while for Mr. Simpson to get on the phone,
right?

A. Yes.

Q. First you were transferred to his room, right?

A. No. They said that Mr. Simpson had checked out of the hotel.

Q. And then you said can you find him?

A. Yes. I let them know who I was and that it was very important, that
it was a matter of urgency.

Q. You were put on hold, right?

A. I can't remember -- I was -- whether I was put on hold or the phone
was placed down, yes.

Q. So some time elapsed and then you were connected to Mr. Simpson,
right?

A. That's correct.

Q. And in that conversation you told Mr. Simpson that you would be
there in a matter of how many minutes, ten minutes or so?

A. Yes, ten, fifteen minutes. I was actually making very good time.

Q. And Mr. Simpson said get here as quickly as you can, right?

A. He just said, "Well, maybe I'll go with you then." That's what I
recall.

Q. So by the time you hung up that fourth phone call with Mr. Simpson
which you placed -- which call was placed at 8:48 a.m., you still left
it with him that you were going to try to get there to get him to the
airport, right?

A. Yes.

Q. And he said, maybe I'll go with you then, right?

A. Right.

Q. And according to your phone records, how long did that call with
Mr. Simpson that you placed at 8:48 a.m. on June 13 take place?

A. Two minutes.

Q. So you got off the phone with him roughly at 8:50?

A. That would be good, accurate.

Q. At 8:50 a.m., Mr. Simpson told you that he would wait for you,
right?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, when you got to the hotel --

MR. LEONARD: Where are we?

Oh, okay. I got it.

MR. PETROCELLI: (Reading:)

Q. When you got to the hotel, do you know what time it was?

A. No, I don't have an accurate -- I have no idea. I was in such a
hurry, I didn't look at my watch to be specific.

MR. PETROCELLI: Can you -- could you slow down a little bit?

MR. GELBLUM: Sure.

MR. LEONARD: You're in a hurry; I can see that.

MR. PETROCELLI: (Reading:)

Q. Was it 9 o'clock?

MR. GELBLUM: Did you get that Gina.

THE COURT REPORTER: Um-hum.

A. It could have been.

Q. When you pulled up, you -- did you get out of the car to look for
Mr. Simpson?

A. I got out of car to go into the lobby to look for Mr. Simpson.

Q. And who did you encounter? Did you encounter John Johnson?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Do you know who John Johnson was?

A. Absolutely.

Q. And when you saw John Johnson, he told you that Mr. Simpson had
just left?

A. That's correct.

Q. And you had just missed him, right?

A. That's correct.

Q. And Mr. Johnson told you that you were to take Mr. Simpson's clubs
to the airport to try to get them to him, correct?

A. He didn't tell me to. He didn't tell me to get them --

Q. He didn't mention anything to you about the golf clubs?

A. No.

Q. Nothing at all?

A. Nothing. That I recall, no. He just said that he had just left with
Kilduff. It was Dave, Dave Kilduff, obviously, and that I had just
missed him. At this point I went out to the car myself and went to the
airport.

Q. Did you tell Mr. Johnson that you were going to then go off to the
airport to try to deliver his clubs to him?

MR. LEONARD: I have an objection, Your Honor. Can we -- okay.

MR. LEONARD: Keeping in mind we got no designation --

MR. PETROCELLI: Your Honor, I object to these repeated comments about
designations. I've given them what we intended to read.

(The following proceedings were held at the bench, with the reporter.)

MR. PETROCELLI: This is what I have left, Your Honor, three more
pages.

We're at line 23.

MR. LEONARD: We're on page 23 -- I mean line 23 at page 91. This is
just the question he asked.

MR. PETROCELLI: "Did you tell Mr. Johnson?"

Answer: "I may have." I'm skipping to line 10.

MR. LEONARD: I'd move to strike. Speculative. I may have, you may
have, I don't remember, I mean it's --

THE COURT: It's stricken.

MR. LEONARD: Okay.

Then where are you going?

MR. PETROCELLI: Line 10.

THE COURT: You have anymore objections?

MR. LEONARD: I don't know. I don't know what he's doing.

MR. PETROCELLI: Read along. You're supposed to object as we read
along.

MR. LEONARD: All right; that's what we'll do. I thought we were
designating.

THE COURT: Let's save us a trip, if you've got some more objections.

MR. PETROCELLI: Read it fastly. It's all -- it's what you --

MR. LEONARD: "Fastly" is not a word, but go ahead.

THE COURT: You have an eavesdropper behind you.

MR. P. BAKER: I want to have them all get along.

MR. PETROCELLI: Read mine. It's quick. Read where I've highlighted.

MR. LEONARD: In yellow?

MR. PETROCELLI: Yeah, yellow and blue.

We're almost to the end. We're doing the phone call the next day. No.
Now go right here.

We did that already.

MR. LEONARD: We did.

MR. PETROCELLI: It goes --

MR. LEONARD: Right. I knew that. (Indicating to page of transcript.)

MR. PETROCELLI: Then we go to the phone call, and that's it.

MR. LEONARD: Let me see. Let me look at it now.

MR. PETROCELLI: Yeah, read it.

MR. LEONARD: Not this.

MR. PETROCELLI: Wherever it's highlighted.

MR. P. BAKER: Why do you -- did you change colors? I'm joking.

MR. PETROCELLI: You know me; I'm super-organized.

MR. LEONARD: Okay. That's it?

MR. PETROCELLI: No. That's the conversation.

MR. LEONARD: All of this with Simpson, starting here?

MR. PETROCELLI: Mr. Leonard ....

MR. LEONARD: Okay. (Counsel reads transcript.)

MR. LEONARD: Okay. I do have an objection.

This is where you're starting?

MR. PETROCELLI: Let me tell you what this Exhibit --

THE COURT REPORTER: Page and line?

MR. PETROCELLI: This is page 103.

The next day on the 14th --

THE COURT: Line 8?

MR. PETROCELLI: -- after Simpson returned from Chicago on the 13th, on
the next day, he called Kilduff and he called Merrill up, purportedly
to apologize for having been brusque the day before. And then the
subject turned to golf clubs, getting them back. And I'm eliciting
that conversation.

MR. LEONARD: Okay. But why don't you let me object first, so we don't
waste time. I obviously don't have an objection to the general -- what
the general subject is. But his reaction and his state of mind, I have
an objection to Kilduff -- I mean Merrill -- where he says he was
surprised. I have an objection to that.

MR. PETROCELLI: It goes to the credibility of Mr. Simpson's
explanation that he was calling to apologize. This was a surprise that
he received this phone call.

THE COURT: Sustain the objection.

MR. LEONARD: Thank you.

THE COURT: His state of mind.

MR. PETROCELLI: It's not offered for a state of mind; it's offered to
show that it was -- what his perception of the conversation was.

THE COURT: His perception of the conversation is irrelevant.

MR. PETROCELLI: Pretty unusual thing, Your Honor. The guy didn't --

MR. LEONARD: Argue it.

MR. PETROCELLI: I'm entitled to elicit that, that the person on the
phone was really surprised to get such a call from someone he didn't
know, never met before, other than the day before. It's not like it's
a long-time relationship. They didn't know each other, and the guy's
calling to apologize.

That's the whole point of it, of the conversation. It's pretextual
[sic] with what my argument will be, that it was designed to find out
about the golf clubs which he was fervently concerned about. That's
the whole point of what I have been reading to get to this point. Now
that I'm getting to the punch line, he wants to sustain the objection.

MR. LEONARD: That's a great argument for the jury, but it's not --

MR. PETROCELLI: I'm entitled to get the reaction. It's a -- it's the
reaction of the person who's having the direct phone call.

MR. LEONARD: So what? It's not relevant and it's argumentative. It's
an argument for the jury.

MR. PETROCELLI: No, it's not.

MR. LEONARD: Sure it is.

MR. PETROCELLI: I can argue the fact. I have to elicit his reaction.
It's only a couple questions.

MR. LEONARD: No. I find that to be, like I said before, and as I said
here, it's argumentative and it's irrelevant. That's the fact that he
makes the phone call.

MR. PETROCELLI: SHHH. Keep your voice down.

MR. LEONARD: The fact he makes the phone call, the substance of the
phone call -- I don't like it, but it's relevant.

THE COURT: Sustain the objection.

MR. LEONARD: Thank you.

THE COURT: You may put in that portion where he called and apologized,
but the witness's reaction of surprise, I think, is irrelevant.

(The following proceedings were held in open court, in the presence of
the jury.)

MR. PETROCELLI: Page 92. Starting at line 10, Mr. Leonard.

MR. LEONARD: Okay.

MR. PETROCELLI: (Reading:)

what desk or what the reason was to go downstairs. Whatever desk it
was it was closed. So I went back upstairs to the same agent, and she
said she would take care of it for me.

Q. She would take care of what?

A. Getting the clubs to LA.

Q. Did you also discuss with the agent how the clubs would get to Mr.

was the mother of two children that they had together, right?

A. Yes.

Q. And that they had been divorced?

A. He mentioned that, yes.

Q. Correct?

MR. PETROCELLI: On page 28, Mr. Leonard, line 19.

Q. Mr. Merrill?

A. Yes.

phone call from Mr. Simpson?

A. Yes.

Q. Tell me what Mr. Simpson said in that phone call?

A. I don't -- I don't recall word for word. He gave me an explanation
of what happened the day before. Obviously, by then I knew what had
transpired. That was basically the whole conversation.

Q. Was there any discussion about the golf bag?

A. Yes.

Q. Who initiated that discussion?

A. I initiated that conversation.

Q. Why did you ask him about the golf bag?

A. I didn't ask him about the golf bag. Just in the course of the
conversation I mentioned that I tried to get the golf bag to him in
time knowing that he was going back to LA or wherever he was going and
that I put it on a plane that just left -- I'm sorry that left just
after his.

Q. Do you recall any further discussion about the golf bag in that
conversation?

A. Well, he asked whether or not I had made any arrangements to have
it delivered to him. I said "no, I didn't. I just got it there." I
gave him the baggage ticket number and he just said, "well, I guess
I'll have somebody go pick it up." And that was the whole basis of
that conversation.

Mr. Leonard, page 37 line 14. "Q. Now, after Mr. Simpson called you
and apologized on the morning of June 15 -- that should be June 14 --
did he ever call you again later that week to apologize for anything
else?

Q. Did he call you to talk to you about what was happening in your
life, how things were with you?

A. No.

Q. Did he talk to you about anything that week?

A. No. Just that one call.

Q. So after the call in which he apologized to you, you never spoke to
him again, right?

A. That's correct.

Q. So the last time he ever talked to you was on the morning of June
14 when he called you to apologize, right?

A. That's correct.

Q. And it's that very same phone call that you and he talked about his
golf clubs, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. The last time you ever spoke to O.J. Simpson was on June 14, 1994,
correct?

A. That's correct.

A. No.

Q. Did you have any intention or plan to do that?

A. Yes.

Q. And what was your plan?

been made to her to let her know where Mr. Simpson's clubs were.

Q. But the remainder of that day you made no attempt to notify Mr.
Simpson in Los Angeles about his clubs, right?

MR. PETROCELLI: That's all I have.

MR. LEONARD: Can I have just one minute, Your Honor?

(Pause in proceedings.)

MR. LEONARD: I don't have anything at this time.

MR. PETROCELLI: Okay. Your Honor, that concludes the witnesses.

We have some requests for admissions to read to the jury. I would ask
that, as we did before, in the interest of time, that we read the
defense qualification at the beginning and at the end of the set.

THE COURT: You may.

MR. PETROCELLI: Thank you.

MR. GELBLUM: This is request 484.

The crime scene at 875 South Bundy, as found by the Los Angeles Police
Department officers on the night of June 12 through 13, 1994, was
consistent with murders committed by a person who was enraged at the
time of the murders.

Response: Admit.

For purposes of this request, defendant is defining the term
"consistent with" to mean one possible explanation without any
limitation or other possibilities and without any implication as to
the likelihood of this possibility vis-a-vis any other possibility.

Request for admission number 493.

Head hairs exhibiting the same microscopic characteristics as head
hairs of Nicole Brown Simpson were found on the items that were
identified in connection with the criminal trial in the matter of
People V. Simpson, case number BA097-211, hereafter the criminal
trial, as LAPD evidence item 9.

Response: Admit. In admitting this request for admission, the defense
will assume that the point in time referred to is the time in item
with the number specified by plaintiffs was examined by an outside
laboratory, as opposed to the time of collection or any other point in
time, and the term "same microscopic characteristics" to mean "similar
characteristics," when examined microscopically.

Request for admission number 494:

Head hairs exhibiting the same microscopic characteristics as head
hairs of Ronald Goldman were found on the item that was identified in
connection with the criminal trial as LAPD evidence item 9.

Response: Admit. And then the same qualifications.

Request for admission number 495:

Head hairs exhibiting the same microscopic characteristics as head
hairs of Orenthal James Simpson were found on the item that was
identified in connection with the criminal trial as LAPD evidence item
38.

Response: Admit. Again, with the same qualification.

Request for admission number 496:

Head hairs exhibiting the same microscopic characteristics as head
hairs of Orenthal James Simpson were found on item identified in
connection with the criminal trial as LAPD evidence item 81.

Response: Admit.

Each of these that I'm going to read have the same qualification
attached to them.

REPORTER'S DAILY TRANSCRIPT
DECEMBER 4, 1996

SUPERIOR COURT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA
FOR THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES

SHARON RUFO, ET AL., N/A, PLAINTIFFS,

VS.

ORENTHAL JAMES SIMPSON, ET AL., DEFENDANTS.


SANTA MONICA, CALIFORNIA
WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 4, 1996
8:50 A.M.

DEPARTMENT NO. WEQ
HON. HIROSHI FUJISAKI, JUDGE

(REGINA D. CHAVEZ, OFFICIAL REPORTER)

(The following proceedings were held in open court, outside the
presence of the jury.)

THE COURT: Juror number 206 requests December 19 and January 7 off as
religious holidays. The Court will grant it.

THE CLERK: Is the order -- request sealed?

MR. PETROCELLI: Your Honor, I -- you said, Judge, January 6? No?

THE CLERK: 7th.

THE COURT: January 7, December 19.

MR. BAKER: We'll be dark?

THE COURT: Yes. We can't proceed.

MR. PETROCELLI: Are we in session on the 6th of January?

THE COURT: I hope to be. Okay.

The Court at this time will address the objection and motion to
preclude the testimony of witness Nancy Ney.

First of all, what is the nature of the evidence that is being
offered?

MR. GELBLUM: Your Honor, it's set forth in the --

THE COURT: I know what that -- is this a tape or. . .

MR. GELBLUM: No, it's a live witness. It's a live witness supported by
corroborated -- corroborated by documents, notes that she made at the
time. It's primarily live testimony; the documents are just
corroboration.

THE COURT: What is the specific purpose for which plaintiffs seek to
offer this testimony?

MR. GELBLUM: To demonstrate the victim, Nicole Brown Simpson's, state
of mind. This is five days --

THE COURT: State of mind as to what?

MR. GELBLUM: As to her fear of the defendant and the state of her
relationship with the defendant, which is really the heart of the
case. It goes to the motive of defendant to commit these crimes.

Our theory of the case, Your Honor, as you probably know, is that the
crimes -- the primary motivation for the crime was retaliation, not
rejection, from Ms. Brown's rejection of Mr. Simpson, the termination
of the relationship and the rejection, specifically on June 12, as
well, after the recital. And her state of mind about the relationship,
the state of the relationship, her extreme fear of the defendant, as
demonstrated by the phone call with Ms. Ney.

It is probative of the fact that she thought he was the one who
terminated the relationship and that she would not want to be with him
and would want to stay as far away from him as possible.

Very much goes to her rejection of him. Mr. Simpson's position is
directedly [sic] to the contrary, that he broke up with her, he
terminated the relationship, he was happily on another relationship
and didn't care about her anymore, had nothing to do with her.

I'm sorry. He said that he still loved her, that he was on to another
relationship, and that he had put that behind him and was on with his
life. And this impeaches that clearly, and really goes to the heart of
the motive of the case, as to what's going on in the relationship in
these few days before the murders.

As the Court in Zack said, antagonism, hostility, enmity in the
relationship is highly probative and always relevant. That's exactly
what this goes to show.

THE COURT: Okay.

Defense have anything further they wish to add to your written
opposition?

MR. BAKER: Well, just a couple things, Your Honor.

I don't believe that the state of mind of Nicole Brown Simpson is an
issue, nor has it ever been put in issue. It's relevant to the issues
in this case, and to the case the Supreme Court said in People versus
Ireland.

But this is the ultimate, to me, bootstrap argument. They want to
attempt, on these hearsay documents, to prove the state of mind of
O.J. Simpson by asserting the state of mind of Nicole Brown Simpson on
documents that I believe, that if the Court just looks at them on
their face, may have some problem relative to their trustworthiness.

First of all, the date has been crossed out.

Second of all, the -- the second page of the sheet is not filled out,
and the third page is a blank page that this woman says she wrote
upon.

There are contradictions in the first page and the third page of the
sheet, but nonetheless, Nicole Brown Simpson is never identified as
the caller.

They want this Court to extrapolate that there's enough indication in
these documents that it was her, and therefore, that this evidence is
admissible to prove her state of mind, so we can prove the state of
mind of O.J. Simpson.

I don't think the law allows that, and that's why we have Evidence
Code Section 1200 et seq, and they've been writing -- attempted to
ride the Zack case, which doesn't stand for the proposition they used
it for. They've attempted to assert that the state of mind was put in
evidence by us, when, of course, it was put in evidence by them.

And they attempt to use, in my view, Your Honor, a bootstrap's
approach, saying -- for example, Mr. Kelly, during questioning,
testified that Nicole was not afraid of him in June of 1994, so they
asked a question, get an answer, and then attempt to say now it's an
issue so we can bootstrap in with the -- This hearsay documents and
testimony of Nancy Ney. If you have any questions relative to this,
I'd be happy to -- to go into detail on -- on where the documents are,
in my view -- in my view, are untrustworthy.

MR. GELBLUM: Your Honor, may I respond briefly?

THE COURT: You may.

MR. GELBLUM: Putting aside Mr. Simpson's testimony in response to Mr.
Kelly's question, which was directly relevant here, he said she was
not afraid of him in 1994.

Mr. Baker, in his opening -- he was not forced to say anything -- said
these words:

That on May 22, 1994, which is a crucial date in our -- our scenario,
that's the day that she terminated the relationship, he said, quote,
'she was hardly afraid of O.J. Simpson.' He said that on May 22.
That's less than two weeks before this conversation where she
expresses extreme fear of this man.

If this testimony is not allowed in, Mr. Simpson is going to be free
to get up there, as Mr. Baker has promised he will, and talk about
what a rosey relationship this was; it was a mutual ending of the
relationship; there were no problems; there was no fear; there was no
hostility; there was no enmity, none of that.

It's not true. And this evidence is highly probative of that.

Ms. Brown Simpson has been silenced. She cannot come here and rebut
that on the stand. This is crucial evidence to dispute and rebut the
testimony Mr. Simpson is going to give.

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, only briefly.

I have to respond, in opening statement to what Mr. Kelly said, and
the argument that he made, and that's what we were doing, discussing
May 22. The fact that Mr. Gelblum wants to assert how relevant it is,
does not get around the hearsay rule and does not get around the fact
that she is never identified and does not get around the fact that her
state of mind is not an issue in this case.

And you can't prove Simpson's state of mind through the state of mind
of the decedent.

THE COURT: Well, the Court has reread People versus Ortiz, 38 Cal.Ap.
4th 377, and I'm reminded by Mr. Gelblum about the Zack case.

I think on that basis, on the basis on which the plaintiff has
represented that he is offering the testimony, the Court finds that --
that there is an exception, in view of the Evidence Code, for those
purposes, and the objection is overruled.

Let's bring the jury in.

(The jurors resumed their respective seats.)

THE COURT: Good morning.

JURORS: Morning.

THE COURT: Juror number 206, I received your note and we will adjourn
on those days that you requested. That will be December the 19th and
January the 7th.

JUROR: Thank you.

MR. LEONARD: Your Honor, can we approach very briefly?

THE COURT: Yes.

THE COURT REPORTER: With the reporter?

MR. LEONARD: Yes.

MR. PETROCELLI: The last clip I have is 69 to the top of 73 to which
he objects and it starts here and ends here. Maybe the best thing to
do is take a quick look at it.

MR. LEONARD: Your Honor, before you start reading, obviously, I
object.

THE COURT: You don't even want me to read it?

MR. LEONARD: Yeah, go ahead. Go ahead. You're the Judge. Go ahead.

THE COURT: I'm just wondering why you don't want me to read it.

MR. LEONARD: Dont want you to read it?

(Pause for the Court to read document.)

THE COURT: To where?

MR. PETROCELLI: To these next two pages.

MR. PETROCELLI: And it ends with this last line right there.

(Referring to page 73.)

MR. PETROCELLI: The relevance of all of this is to show that Mr.
Simpson, who denies striking Nicole, lied to Frank Olson to protect
his image and his financial interests, all of which we are proffering
to impeach his testimony here on the witness stand, that he didn't hit
her in 1989, and then he had motivation to lie.

MR. LEONARD: First of all, this is -- this is all going to Mr. Olson's
state of mind, number one.

THE COURT: Excuse me?

MR. LEONARD: Go ahead.

THE COURT: For the record, we are discussing pages 69 through line 1
of page 73 of the transcript of Mr. Olson's deposition.

MR. LEONARD: Number one. It's going to Olson's state of mind. It has
-- it's replete with references to Olson's feelings.

I was stunned. I was -- I didn't believe it.

I don't think he asked him anything about '89 in here; he asked him
about whether he had heard of the '83 -- excuse me -- '93 incidents.
There's no foundation that he had ever talked to Simpson about that.

There's also a section in here about the photographs. Now, they've
shown -- how many times have they shown the photographs? They didn't
even show Olson these photographs. They asked him, are you aware of
some photographs, and then they're asking him his opinion about
whether they were consistent with what Simpson had told him.

I think it's -- it's cumulative. What they've already proven, they've
already gotten in through Olson, Simpson's version of the event. To
the extent that contradicts what other people have said, it's there.
They've already played that portion where Simpson said he shoved her.
This is -- this is cumulative; it's prejudicial; it's -- it's
basically Olson's reaction to this other event he has asked him about.

Were you aware that Simpson was excessive by following or stalking
Nicole? Okay. There's no foundation that, first of all, that in this
case, that that's occurred. Number two, that he ever discussed this
with Olson, if there was ever an opportunity for Olson to discuss it.
There's no foundation.

Finally, again, it's cumulative. It's prejudicial.

THE COURT: You're repeating yourself.

MR. LEONARD: A little cumulative.

MR. KELLY: You're cumulative.

MR. PETROCELLI: Your Honor, the other part I neglected to mention --
Mr. Leonard reminded me -- this also goes to show that Simpson is
capable of acting in a certain way, and at the same time, withhold and
hide information from people.

And this goes to the demeanor case. And maybe some of this is probably
the more appropriate response of their demeanor evidence.

They're going to put on the fact that he signed autographs and he's
acting normal before and after the murders, indicating that he
couldn't have possibly committed the murders; he's a guy who worked
for him 20 years, who cultivated his image, to say I never saw this
side of O.J. Simpson, to prove that there is another side to Simpson
that he doesn't show others; that he's perfectly capable of acting in
this normal, outgoing, gregarious personality, even when he's under
the utmost stress.

THE COURT: I'll sustain the objection. I don't think Mr. Olson's state
of mind is relevant.

MR. PETROCELLI: Can I have that without prejudice, if they get into
this area in their case?

MR. LEONARD: No.

MR. PETROCELLI: I'm able to ask, Your Honor, to place some of this
testimony on our rebuttal case depending on what they do with
demeanor.

THE COURT: The reason I am sustaining the objection is because I don't
think Mr. Olson's reaction -- and that's all it is, is Mr. Olson's
reaction -- that you've evoked in your examination to Mr. Simpson's
conduct, I don't think they're relevant. That's like putting Mr. Olson
in the jury box. That's --

MR. PETROCELLI: What about the part, like, where he said, like, in 17
years, never ever seen the guy lose his temper?

MR. LEONARD: I'll agree to that part only.

MR. PETROCELLI: Can I reserve some of this for rebuttal? That's all
I'm asking, to revisit it with Your Honor. I won't get into his
state-of-mind issues, though, okay.

MR. LEONARD: We're going to --

THE COURT: The defense case -- you may make an offer and I'll make a
ruling.

MR. PETROCELLI: Thank you, Your Honor.

(The following proceedings were held in open court, in the presence of
the jury.)

MR. LEONARD: Can you remind me what page we left off?

MR. PETROCELLI: At the end of the -- yeah, at end of the -- the -- at
the end of the day, we left off with the last video clip, and that
will conclude our presentation.

I think Mr. Leonard has some portions he wants to read in response.
We're now obviously referring to the video deposition of Frank Olson.

MR. BAKER: I thought you had five or ten minutes.

MR. PETROCELLI: No, I've cut it out.

MR. LEONARD: Okay.

(Portions of the deposition of Frank Olson were read into the record
as follows, Mr. Leonard reading the questions and Mr. P. Baker reading
the answers.)

MR. LEONARD: Your Honor, we will be reading from the same deposition.
And obviously, Mr. Baker will be playing the part of Mr. Olson.

If you could turn, please, Mr. Baker, to page 38, beginning at line
12.

MR. P. BAKER: Okay.

MR. LEONARD: (Reading:) Is that the only -- Is that the one and only
time you spoke to Nicole about the incident?

A. Yes.

Q. And you never spoke to Mr. Simpson again about it; is that true?

A. No, did not have another conversation.

MR. LEONARD: Okay. Over to page 43, line 19.

MR. P. BAKER: Okay.

Q. And did he describe to you or say anything to you that Nicole had
hit him?

A. I don't recall the incident -- what he was saying to me was that
Nicole was out of control and was damaging his Tiffany lamps and so
forth, and she was just out of control.

That's -- That's -- and I don't recall him saying whether she hit him
or not.

MR. LEONARD: Okay. Over to page 53, line 8.

MR. P. BAKER: Okay.

MR. LEONARD: (Reading:) When he returned to the subject of Nicole, did
you let him talk?

A. Yes.

Q. And he said -- go ahead. I'm sorry.

A. And he said essentially the same thing; he was very disappointed
that it hadn't worked out; it was obvious that their reconciliation
hasn't worked out.

Q. Was this a telephone call?

A. No, I was with him.

Q. Where were you with him?

A. I was with him at our golf club here in New Jersey.

Q. You remember the date?

A. It was sometime in May, end of May. He had come to New York to do a
travel agency talk.

Q. Would that be the ASTA regional dinner?

A. That could be it.

Q. Fairly significant event?

A. Yes. Even asked to give a speech there. And that was on a Saturday
evening, as I recall.

Q. In New York City?

A. In New York City.

And he called me on Monday morning. I did not attend the ASTA meeting.
He called me on Monday morning and wanted to get together and asked if
my afternoon was free. And I met him and we played golf in the
afternoon at our golf club. And then I had a --

Q. Which golf club was that -- was that?

A. Arcola, A-R-C-O-L-A.

Q. Did you remember the date of that?

A. It was the Monday following that Saturday evening ASTA thing that
he did. That was in May, I think.

Q. So Saturday, 'cause May 14, then, Monday, would have been May 16?

A. Yes, yes.

Q. Okay. And the two of you played golf together?

A. Played with two friends.

Q. Who were the two friends?

A. A fellow by the name of James Patton, P-A-T-T-O-N, and a Norman
Williams.

And then following that, we stopped to have -- Patton, myself and O.J.
stopped to have -- I had a Diet Coke and O.J. had a beer, and the club
was closed that day, except the golf course was open, so we went down
the road to a place to have a Coke and we talked for about a half an
hour, then he left, went back to New York.

Q. The conversation that you had recounted moments before about
Nicole, occurred on this day?

A. Yes.

Q. On what we believe is May 16, on Monday?

A. It was the Monday after that Saturday evening, yes.

Q. And did this conversation occur with you and Mr. Simpson alone with
regard -- was anyone else present?

A. Mr. Patton was there in the beginning, but he didn't stay long.

Q. And was this at the restaurant?

A. It -- this was at the bar at the -- at this restaurant.

Q. What was the name of the restaurant?

A. I don't recall. It's not on -- I just don't recall.

Q. Did Mr. Simpson talk about Nicole at any point in time when Mr.
Patton was still there?

A. I don't recall.

Q. Did Mr. Simpson know Mr. Patton?

A. Yes.

Q. They were known -- knowing -- known each other for a long time?

A. He knew him from playing golf with him at the club.

Q. Arcola?

A. Arcola.

Q. Was this conversation at the bar at the restaurant, the first time
that day Mr. Simpson spoke to you about Nicole?

A. I don't recall.

Q. May he have spoken to you about her while you were playing golf?

A. He may have. O.J. always talked to me about Nicole -- Nicole, over
all the years.

Q. He had spoken to you the night before, on June -- to make
arrangements to play on Monday?

A. No. He called me Monday morning.

Q. Monday morning?

A. At the office.

Q. And prior to getting the call from Mr. Simpson Monday morning, May
16, had you heard that this reconciliation attempt of his and Nicole's
had failed, or did you first come to learn about it that day?

A. I didn't know that they had reconciled again the last time, so it
was all news to me. I mean, I thought they were still away, apart from
each other at the time.

Q. Did Mr. Simpson tell you the reasons why the attempted
reconciliation had failed --

A. No.

Q. -- in his conversation with you on May 16?

A. He did not; just said it was over, that their relationship was
over.

Q. And what was his demeanor, his facial expression, his words, led
you to conclude that he was very upset about this?

A. I didn't have the impression that he was upset. I had the
impression that there was a finality to his relationship. For the
first -- first time I had this -- he communicated a finality of the
relationship with Nicole, and he was thinking about moving to New York
and starting all over again, as opposed to staying in Los Angeles.

Q. Now, earlier, you testified that he seemed upset by this
development.

A. If -- I didn't realize I said that.

Q. Yes. Let me follow up on that.

When he was relating this to you and conveying the impression that
this was final, he did not appear to be happy about it, did he?

A. No, no, he wasn't happy about it. I can't say that he was terribly
distressed; I can just say that he was -- It was a different kind of
emotion that I had seen from O.J. I mean, he was -- O.J. was not his
usual outgoing, effusive self.

I mean, he was signing autographs for kids and talking, and a mother
came up to him about her son had graduated from law school, and he
wrote a note out for her, and he did all those things like he normally
did, but he was -- he was more melancholy than anything. I mean, it
was like a change in his life, you know, that was occurring.

Q. Did he indicate to you, Mr. Olson why he was contemplating moving
to New York from Los Angeles?

A. He just said he wanted to get away from it all. I've forgotten
exactly. I told him I thought it was a good idea.

MR. LEONARD: Okay. Over to page 61, line 8.

Do you remember the last time, prior to the morning of May 16, when
you last spoke to Mr. Simpson?

A. I recall a conversation on the telephone, where he was obligated to
do something for us that he had agreed to do. And it may have been
this event. And there was something to do with the family. And he had
already obligated himself to do this event, and he was -- he was
calling me to -- not to get out of it, but to ask me how to handle --
was there any way he could possibly handle it with the people that he
had -- that he had committed to. It may have been this event. But it
was about a Hertz event. But there was a family obligation that he
wanted to -- that he had fouled up by not recognizing the obligation
of one of his children or both of his children, and he was committed
to do this, and if there was any way he could -- any way he could --
and was there any way he could get out of it -- get out.

Q. Get out of it?

A. Get out of our event.

And I referred him to the person that had organized the event.

Q. Did you tell him that he couldn't get out of it?

A. I told him I didn't realize or know what the commitments were, and
that he had to talk to the person that organized the event.

Q. Who did you refer him to?

A. I just don't remember which event it was.

Q. Assuming it was the ASTA regional dinner on May 14, does that cause
you to remember?

A. That -- then it would have been Bill Maloney, who is our
Vice-President of Travel Industries Sales.

Q. What does ASTA stand for?

A. American Society of Travel Agents.

Q. Is that the last you heard of the question of whether he could get
out of the event?

A. Yes.

Q. Did anybody in the company come and talk to you about it after
that?

A. I talked to -- if this was the event, I talked to whoever it was,
to find out what occurred.

Q. And what did you find out?

A. I found out that, whatever event it was, that he was trying to
avoid, that it was impossible to get out of. I mean, there were
already brochures printed or something, something. There was a lot of
-- There was -- it was not easy to unwind it.

I think, as I recall, the conversation was between the person and --
if it was Maloney and O.J. -- that if O.J. insisted on getting out of
it, they would have released him, but it was very difficult for us as
a company.

Q. And to your knowledge, O.J. did not insist that he --

A. No, he did not. Whatever explanation was given to him, he accepted
his responsibility.

Q. And he did not insist that he get out of it?

A. Right.

MR. LEONARD: That's it, Your Honor.

MR. PETROCELLI: Nothing further.

MR. GELBLUM: Nancy Ney, Your Honor.

MR. BAKER: For the record, I have -- I object under hearsay 352 and
the cases cited in the brief.

THE COURT: The Court's already ruled.

NANCY NEY, called as a witness on behalf of Plantiff, was duly sworn
and testified as follows:

THE CLERK: You do solemnly swear that the testimony you may give in
the cause now pending before this court shall be the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

THE WITNESS: I do.

THE CLERK: And would you please state and spell your name for the
record.

THE WITNESS: Certainly. My name is Nancy, N-A-N-C-Y, middle initial N,
Ney, N-E-Y.

DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. GELBLUM:

Q. Morning, Ms. Ney.

A. Morning.

Q. Do you have any relationship with an organization called Sojourn
House?

A. Yes, I do.

Q. What is Sojourn House?

A. Sojourn House is a -- there's a few different things that Sojourn
does. We have a shelter, crisis shelter, that women can come and stay
for four weeks when they're in crisis.

Q. What kind of crisis?

A. Battering. They're battered women and their children. They come,
and they get counseling and help, and any kind of help they really
need. And it's a safe place, and it's secret.

Q. Secret?

A. Secret.

Q. The location is secret?

A. It's a private place, yes.

Q. Why is the location secret?

A. So that their batterer can't find them.

Q. What do you do at Sojourn House?

A. One of the things I do is, I work on the hot line.

Q. What's the hot line?

A. It's 24 hours. There's someone there every hour of the day and
night. And women call with -- battered women can call when they're in
crisis or with legal problems, medical problems, any problem that
might have to do with their battering situation.

Q. Are you also on the Board of Directors at Sojourn?

A. Yes, I am.

Q. Did you work at Sojourn in June of 1994?

A. Yes.

Q. What did you do there at that time?

A. I was working on the hot line.

Q. Same thing you described?

A. Yes.

Q. How often did you work?

A. I worked one day a week, a four-hour shift.

Q. The time that you worked remain constant, or was it different each
week?

A. It was constant.

Q. What was it?

A. It was the 8:00 to 12:00, 8:00 a.m. to 12 p.m. shift, Tuesday
mornings.

Q. By the way, did you receive any training before you started working
as a person -- working on the hot line?

A. Yes.

Q. What was the training?

A. The State of California mandates a 40-hour training for anyone in
-- working in domestic violence.

Q. What does the training consist of?

A. It consists of learning about the psychology of domestic abuse,
what goes on in a relationship, the dynamics between the woman and her
partner.

We learn about children's issues, how children react to domestic
violence. We learn about legal issues.

Just everything that has to do with domestic violence.

Q. Okay.

A. And we also have support groups.

Q. And you get certified by the state?

A. Yes, we get a certificate, and they -- we are then able to work
with battered women.

Q. You had completed that training before June 7, 1994?

A. Yes.

Q. Were you answering the phones on the hot line on June 7, 1994?

A. I was.

Q. That was a Tuesday?

A. Yes.

Q. Did you receive a call that morning, at about 11 o'clock, from a
woman who identified herself as Nicole?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Did she give her last name?

A. No.

Q. Did you ask for it?

A. I did not ask.

Q. Is that unusual?

A. No, it's not unusual. I never ask and they usually never tell.

Q. Why is that?

A. For confidentiality.

MR. BAKER: Objection. Relevance and speculation.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. For confidentiality, they don't want their last names known.

Q. (BY MR. GELBLUM) Does this person, this woman who identified
herself as Nicole, give you any other information about herself that
would help you identify her?

A. She did, yes.

Q. What did she tell you?

A. She told me her age.

Q. What did she say?

A. When -- I believe at the time was 34. I don't know exactly. But it
was in her mid-thirties.

Q. Okay.

A. She told me that she had -- she was divorced. She told me that she
had been married for eight years. She told me that she had two
children, a boy and a girl, and I don't remember now the exact ages,
but when I heard about the ages of the children, they were the same
ages, as I recalled, not right now. I don't remember the ages. But at
that point, they were the correct ages; they were under 10.

Q. She told you both children were under ten?

A. Under ten.

Q. Did she say the gender of the children?

A. She said she had a boy and a girl.

Q. Did she say what part of the city she lived in?

A. She said she lived in West L.A.

Q. Did she tell you her ethnicity?

A. She was Caucasian.

Q. Okay.

Did she tell you at some point during the call whether she had family
in the area?

A. She did say she had family in the area, yes.

Q. Did she tell you at some point in the conversation whether her
ex-husband knew where her family lived?

MR. BAKER: I'm going to object to leading, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. GELBLUM) Did she say anything to you about prior -- I'm
sorry. Let me -- I'm getting ahead of myself here.

Have you -- have you heard since that date, tape recording of an
October 25, 1994, 911 call made by Nicole Brown Simpson?

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, I'm going to object. I want to approach on
this.

THE COURT: Overruled. Denied.

A. Yes, I have heard the tape.

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, I'm going to object to this. There is no
foundation for any voice analysis.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. GELBLUM) And was the voice that you heard on that 911 call
consistent with the voice that you heard on June 7, 1994 from this
woman named Nicole?

A. Yes.

MR. BAKER: Leading, suggestive. Move to strike. Leading, subjective,
no foundation.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. GELBLUM) Did she say anything about her husband's
occupation?

A. She didn't mention his occupation specifically. But she does say
that he was very high profile and she said that if she told me who he
was, I would know.

Q. Did she tell you who he was?

A. No.

Q. I'm sorry, I think I misspoke. You said she was divorced?

A. She said she was divorced.

Q. It was her ex-husband?

A. It was her ex-husband, yes.

Q. Now, did she tell you anything about what was prompting her to make
this phone call?

A. Yes, she did.

Q. What did she say?

A. She said that she was frightened.

MR. BAKER: Again, hearsay, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. She said that she was very frightened.

Q. (BY MR. GELBLUM) Did she say -- did she sound frightened to you?

A. She sounded frightened to me, yes.

Q. Did she say why she was frightened?

A. Yes.

Q. What did she tell you?

A. She said that her ex-husband had been calling her on the phone. He
had been -- during these calls, he would beg her to please come back
to him, he needed her, needed her back with him.

She said that he had been stalking her. She said that when she went to
a restaurant, she would be sitting there and he'd be sitting -- she'd
turn around, and he'd be there staring at her.

She would go to the market; he'd be there in the next aisle, looking
at her. She'd be driving down the street; she'd look in the rearview
mirror, he'd be there.

And she said this unnerved her and she was very frightened by it.

Q. As a result of her telling you that her ex-husband was stalking
her, did you ask her any questions about any other activities that her
ex-husband had possibly engaged in?

A. I had asked her whether he had ever beaten her.

Q. And what did she say?

A. She said yes.

Q. Did she give you any indication about how long the beatings had
been going on?

A. Well, she didn't say specifically how many years the beatings had
been going on, but they'd been going on throughout her marriage.

Q. Okay.

Did you ask her anything about any threats?

A. I did ask, yes.

Q. What did you ask?

A. I said has he ever threatened you.

Q. What -- why did you ask that?

A. Because -- well, that's not -- I ask every battered woman that
calls; it's a question you ask; it's an important question. Plus, this
stalking worried me a lot.

Q. Why is that?

A. When a man stalks a woman, it's just very serious behavior. It's a
red light that you need to pay attention to.

Q. Is that something you learned in your training?

A. Yes.

Q. Did Nicole respond to your question about whether her ex-husband
had threatened her?

A. She did.

Q. What did she say?

A. She said that he had told her a few different times that if he ever
caught her with another man, he would kill her.

Q. Did she express any confusion during this phone call?

A. She did, yes.

Q. On what subject?

A. She was confused because he -- that this -- his behavior so
frightened her, that --

MR. BAKER: I'm going to move to strike as nonresponsive and request
that the witness be ordered to answer the question, not give her
interpretation.

MR. GELBLUM: I think she's trying to, Your Honor.

MR. BAKER: Well, I request --

THE COURT: Overruled.

You may answer.

A. She told me that she was -- his behavior frightened her to such an
extent that she was considering -- she was asking my opinion, whether
I thought it might be safer for her and her children to move back in
with him.

Q. (BY MR. GELBLUM) And did you and she discuss that subject?

A. We did.

Q. Did she express coming to a conclusion before the end of the call?

A. By the end of the call, she had come to a conclusion.

Q. What did she say?

A. Well, after discussing the pros and cons, she came to the
conclusion that in the long run, it would not be best for her to move
back in.

Q. Okay.

And the reason, again, she said that, she was wondering about whether
she should move back in was what?

A. She --

MR. BAKER: Asked and answered.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. GELBLUM) How long did the call last, altogether, Ms. Ney?

A. I would say about 20 minutes.

Q. How did the call end?

A. She thanked me for helping her and letting her get out some of her
feelings. And she asked me -- told me that she wanted to just think
about what we talked about, and could she please call back the
following week when I would be there.

And I said, sure, call back anytime.

Q. Did she ever call back?

A. No.

Q. Now, did you make some notes during the phone call?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

MR. GELBLUM: I'd like to mark as next in order, 2223, a two-page
document here.

MR. BAKER: I'd like the original to be marked as 2223.

MR. GELBLUM: The only problem I have with that, the shelter wants the
original back at the conclusion of the case. I don't care.

THE COURT: Is there any difference between the original and copies?

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, there's going to be -- to be some testimony
relative to these documents.

THE COURT: Okay. Original marked.

(The instrument herein referred to as Two-page document described as a
call sheet filled out by Nancy Ney as a result of her telephone call
with a woman named Nicole was marked for identification as Plaintiffs'
Exhibit No. 2223.)

THE WITNESS: These --

Q. (BY MR. GELBLUM) Can you tell us what Exhibit 2223 is?

A. Yes. This is a call sheet that, when every -- each call that comes
in must be filled out, each woman that calls.

Q. Mr. Baker, I think --

MR. BAKER: I certainly did, sure.

Q. (BY MR. GELBLUM) Is Exhibit 2223 the call sheet that you filled out
during your call with Nicole?

A. Yes, it is.

Q. The copy you have there is two pages, is the original -- this is
the original the two-sided --

A. Right -- yes.

Q. The top left entry is the date. Do you see that?

A. Yes.

Q. And the date you wrote down originally was May 7; is that correct?

A. I did.

Q. And was that the correct date?

A. It was not the correct date.

Q. How did you determine what the correct date was?

A. Because I was not there May 7, number one.

Number two, after I heard about the murders, I thought that this --
the details sounded rather familiar to me, and I went back the next
Tuesday I was in and I found my sheet in with the June sheets. And I
just, you know, 'cause it was the first Tuesday I was there in June, I
just was automatically writing the month before, the five, and, you
know, like you do in your checkbook, the first of the month.

Q. After you -- You, as you just said, you learned about the murders,
you thought this sounded familiar.

Did you also make some additional notes shortly after that about the
phone call?

A. Yes.

Q. I'll show you the original of these notes which we'll mark as 2224.

(The instrument herein referred to as Handwritten notes of Nancy Ney
was marked for identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 2224.)

Q. (BY MR. GELBLUM) Those are notes you made?

A. Yes.

Q. Why did you make those notes?

A. Actually, I think at this point -- that was about two weeks after
the murder, and I had already contacted the police department and they
were going to be calling me back. And I thought that just for -- just
so that I could preserve my own memory, since memories do tend to fade
over time, details, that I would just write down a few little details
just to jog my memory so I'd remember.

MR. GELBLUM: I have no further questions, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Cross.

CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. BAKER:

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Ms. Ney, you -- you testified yesterday in Orange
County?

MR. GELBLUM: Your Honor, objection.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) -- in the custody hearing --

MR. GELBLUM: Objection.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) -- of Mr. O.J. Simpson --

MR. PETROCELLI: Excuse me.

MR. GELBLUM: Objection.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) -- did you not?

MR. GELBLUM: He knows this is out of line.

THE COURT: The fact that she testified, you may answer yes or no.
Contents of the objection sustained.

A. I did testify.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) And Mr. Simpson was present at those hearings?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) At those hearings?

MR. PETROCELLI: This is for the benefit of the jury --

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. PETROCELLI: -- to the question.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You talked to Natasha Roit.

MR. GELBLUM: This is the same subject matter. Counsel has been
cautioned to stay away from this area.

THE COURT: Excuse me. Is this -- you're asking about her testimony?

MR. BAKER: I'm talking about her preparation in talking to the lawyer
who's representing the Simpson -- estate of Nicole Brown Simpson and
the custody hearing.

THE COURT: This is -- not in the trial process. Objection overruled.

MR. BAKER: Relative to her preparation?

THE COURT: If this was not part of her testimony or examination at the
other trial, then the objection is overruled.

MR. BAKER: Okay. I'm sorry. I apologize.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You talked to Natasha Roit before you testified in
the custody hearings relative to Mr. Simpson's children, did you not?

A. Yes.

Q. How long did you talk to her?

A. Do you mean on the phone or --

Q. At any --

A. The whole time, I would say no more than 20 minutes.

Q. And did you go over the -- the forms that you have before you now?

A. No.

Q. And then you talked to Mr. Gelblum how long?

A. Maybe half an hour.

Q. Now, as I understand it, you're on the Board of Directors of the
Sojourn House, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. As I understand it, the -- the form that we have here -- is this
2223? This was the form that was filled out by you, you say, on June
7, 1994, right?

A. Correct.

MR. BAKER: And, Phil, you want to put this on the Elmo.

(Exhibit 2223 displayed on the Elmo.)

MR. BAKER: Can you focus that up for me, please, if you can.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now -- now, on this form, this -- you say asked --
to ask -- has to be filled out every time there is a call that comes
in, right?

A. Right.

Q. Okay.

And on this form, that -- that form -- you have the original in front
of you, do you not?

A. Um-hum. Yes, I do.

Q. That was filled out in ball-point pen, was it not?

A. Yes.

Q. And the 5-17 -- 5-7 was part of the original form, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And you crossed that out sometime subsequently and wrote in, in a
different pen, the "6," did you not?

A. I didn't cross it out.

I mean, I was not the one who did that.

Q. So someone else did that?

A. Yes.

Q. And what's the -- what's the notation next to the 6?

A. I think -- oh, it's CD. That's the woman -- one woman who does
these statistics in the shelter, Cynthia Davis.

Q. You, in the ethnicity, you testified here this morning, that was
Caucasian, right?

A. Right.

Q. You didn't circle anything relative to the ethnicity, did you?

A. No, I didn't.

Q. Now, you said that the victim's age was mid-thirties, did you not?

A. I did.

Q. You didn't put anything in there relative to mid-thirties, did you?

A. No.

Q. And nothing in the subsequent, two-week later notes have anything
about age in them either, do they?

A. No.

Q. And by the way, by the time you filled out the -- the notes that
were two weeks later, you had read about the murders; you had seen the
media barrage about the murders, correct?

A. I suppose so, sure.

Q. And when you say you had heard about the ages of the children, you
remember testifying --

A. Yes um-hum.

Q. -- earlier this morning?

A. Yes.

Q. You heard about the ages in the newspaper, didn't you?

A. Yes.

But can I answer?

Q. You've answered the question. Let's go on up. I want to show you
some more of the forms that you filled out.

Now, down here, on -- pull it up, please, where it says (indicating to
Elmo) abuser and length of relationship.

A. Um-hum.

Q. Now, length of relationship is right next to length of marriage,
isn't it?

A. Right.

Q. The length of the relationship of Nicole Brown Simpson and O.J.
Simpson, in 1994, was what, 17 years?

A. I have no idea.

Q. Now, move the form over. And you put -- put nothing relative to
married number of years, did you?

A. No.

Q. And yet you testified that, in fact, they were married eight years,
did you not?

A. I did testify that --

Q. In fact, in 1994, they hadn't been married eight years, because
they were divorced in 1992, they'd been married seven years; isn't
that right?

A. I guess so.

MR. PETROCELLI: That's eight, Your Honor.

MR. PETROCELLI: February 1985 to October of 1992.

MR. BAKER: Maybe that's new math.

In any event, I'll swear Mr. Petrocelli in; we'll put him on the
stand.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) In any event, Your Honor, the -- you didn't put down
one thing about there how long they were married in the form, where it
calls for that information, true?

A. Wrong place. I put it -- I mean, I was not -- I put it in a spot
that I shouldn't have put it in.

Q. You were talking to her about the length of the relationship, were
you not, in this 20-minute phone call, Ms. Ney?

A. We were talking. I had asked --

Q. Can you answer my question?

I asked you if you were talking about, at any point in the 20-minute
conversation you had with her, the length of the relationship?

A. Yes.

Q. Yes or no?

A. Yes.

Q. That's important if you're talking to a person, is it not?

A. Absolutely.

Q. And the length of the relationship -- whether a person is married
or not married, the length of the relationship is far more significant
than -- than the length of the actual marriage, is it not?

A. She -- Probably.

Q. And if, in fact, they've been living together some six, seven,
eight years, whatever it was before they were married, and they were
together, that's a more significant statistic for the purpose that you
were receiving this call than the length of the actual, legal, marital
relationship, is it not?

A. I had -- well, I had --

Q. Is it not?

A. For the purpose of what I was talking to her about?

Q. Sure. Talking about with this person whether or not there are acts
of violence and -- and whether or not she's in jeopardy, and that
relates not only to whether she's physically near the person who may
be the batterer, but how long this has been going on, true?

A. True.

Q. And whether or not there's been an escalating nature of violence,
correct?

A. Yeah. She told me that.

Q. Well, we'll get into that.

Now, so the length of the relationship, you never put down anyplace,
and as far as you're concerned, the length of the relationship being
eight years is really the length of the marriage, right?

A. In my mind, that was the length of the marriage.

Q. Can you -- well -- and you never put down anyplace, the length of
the relationship; you just made an error and put down the length of
the relationship, eight years, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. All right.

Now, you then go back. Names and ages of children, and you put "2-",
correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, that could be the -- the age of one child, could it not?

A. It could be, but it wasn't what I --

Q. All right.

A. That wasn't it.

Q. Now, you never put down the ages of the children, did you?

A. No. But I know what the ages are.

Q. You knew that the ages of the children had been put in the
newspaper from the date of June 13 until whenever you got together
with Marcia Clark in August of 1994; isn't that true?

A. But that's not -- I --

Q. Can you answer --

A. I remember --

Q. -- my question for a change?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. Argumentative.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) My question, ma'am, is: You knew the ages of the
children from your conversation -- from your looking at the news media
before you ever talked to Marcia Clark in August of 1994?

A. That's not true.

Well, I did know. Where I get the ages of the children are from my
recollection of the phone call.

Q. And the -- you didn't -- Even in your subsequent notes that you say
were done two weeks later, you didn't put the ages of the children in,
did you?

They're right in front of you. Take a look.

A. No. I agree that I didn't.

Q. Now, in your form, right on the back of the form is a --

MR. BAKER: Phil, you want to turn it over.

MR. P. BAKER: I need the original. You have --

MR. BAKER: I've got the original. Let me take this. You keep the
original.

THE WITNESS: Okay.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, on the back of the form, right where you flip
over on the same sheet of paper you were writing on --

A. Um-hum.

Q. -- it says "presenting problem," right?

A. Right.

Q. And you left that blank, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And did you normally fill out only the front page of the form when
you were manning the hot lines?

A. Very frequently, that would be all that would be filled out.

Q. And then you went back two weeks later, you say, and put in what
was the presenting problem, correct?

A. There's no presenting problem.

Q. Well, on your notes, your hand --

A. Oh, yeah, 'cause I remember what she said.

Q. So you -- you remembered two weeks later that the presenting
problem was this purported stalking and spying on her, right?

A. I remembered since the phone call, yes.

Q. The purported problem was this stalking and following her around,
right?

A. Yes.

Q. And there's nothing mentioned in here about anything in
restaurants, nothing in here, even in your -- in your two-week-later
notes about --

A. Well --

Q. -- market, and there's nothing in here about being in the car and
seeing you in the -- seeing you in the rearview mirror when driving;
you would agree with that?

A. I would.

Q. And there was, in terms of your particular -- Well, let me ask you
this:

Right after the -- you publicized this, and said this was Nicole
Brown, you got a lot more donations to Sojourn House --

MR. GELBLUM: Assumes facts not in evidence, publicizing this.

THE COURT: Sustained.

You may ask a question in that regard.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) After you --

By the way, you didn't go meet Marcia Clark until August of 1994; is
that correct?

A. No, I didn't meet with her until January.

Q. 1995?

A. Yeah.

Q. And you didn't talk to anybody in the D.A.'s office or the LAPD
until August of '94, correct?

A. Exactly, yes.

Q. And you had talked to various people in the media before August of
1994?

A. I spoke with nobody in the media.

Q. And it wasn't in the media at all, right?

A. Not that I know of, no.

Q. Now, in terms of your two-week notes, the two-week-old notes, where
you say "threatened and confused " -- you see that under number 4?

A. Um-hum. Yes, I do.

Q. Okay.

Now, you -- You, in writing on the front page --

MR. BAKER: Phil, would you go to the first page, right down at the
bottom.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) She said under her current needs, she didn't -- you
never wrote that she was threatened when you wrote the notes on 5-7 or
6-7, correct?

A. Not in this sheet, no, I did not write that.

Q. Well, this sheet that we have now on the monitor is the only sheet
you wrote contemporaneous with the phone call, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. You didn't write that she was threatened, did you?

A. No. No, I didn't.

Q. And the fact if someone is threatened when they're calling in,
that's significant to you, is it not?

A. Certainly it was.

Q. That would be the most significant thing about the caller who was
calling in, if in fact they are threatened, would it not be?

A. Probably, yes.

Q. And if, in fact, somebody related to you that they were threatened,
that's something you would want to include in the form, to make it
complete, true?

A. I suppose -- Well, this form --

Q. Can you answer my question, please.

A. Technically, yes.

Q. Well, technically. Technically that's something that you want to
perpetuate, that this person is, in fact, threatened, and you want to
perpetuate it in your notes; isn't that correct?

A. This form --

Q. Isn't that correct? If somebody tells you, ma'am, they are
threatened, you want to perpetuate it in your notes?

A. In hindsight, it should have been written down.

Q. Ma'am, I'm talking about when you're doing your job, not talking
about hindsight or anything else. I'm talking about you trying to help
or --

The purpose of this document is to memorialize what went on and with
that call, so if there's a subsequent call or subsequent action, you
have a source to go back to; isn't that true?

A. That is not the purpose of the form.

Q. Now, is it your testimony that she indicated to you that she
wondered whether she would be safer to get herself and the kids back
together with him?

A. She did say that.

Q. And -- That appears nowhere on the form, does it, on the form that
you wrote contemporaneous with the phone call?

A. It doesn't.

Q. And is it your testimony that this person who you say identified
herself as Nicole, was talking that her children were in danger?

A. Yes, she -- yes, she would consider, since she was battered, that
her children would be in danger.

Q. Now I didn't ask you what you thought she considered; I asked you
what she said to you.

Did she say to you, ma'am, that it was her belief when she
communicated with you, that her children were in danger?

A. She didn't say that, not in so many words, no.

Q. And you concluded, two weeks after the call, that she was wondering
whether it would be safer for herself and the kids to move back in
together, right?

A. Her -- her -- her concern was her --

Q. No, I asked --

A. -- her safety.

Q. Well, you concluded two weeks subsequent to your phone call, that,
in fact, this woman had told you that her children were in some sort
of danger, correct?

A. Exactly.

Q. All right. Now --

By the way, did you bring anybody here to watch you testify today?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. Relevance.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You said that the caller had said to you that -- in
questions that you were asked this morning by Mr. Gelblum, that if she
was with another man, her ex-husband would kill her, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. Now, that is something that is very, very significant in the line
of work that you're in, is it not?

A. It is.

Q. I mean that is a threat of death to another human being, true?

A. True.

Q. And that is the most significant thing, according to what you've
testified here today, that was told to you in this purported telephone
call of June 7, 1994, correct?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection, asked and answered.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. When she told me about --

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) No, no, no. I asked you about, if in fact, that was
the most important thing that was told to you in this 20-minute phone
conversation, a threat of death to the caller?

A. It was very important, yes.

Q. And it does not appear anywhere on either your contemporaneous form
or your two week later form, does it?

A. Can I explain?

Q. Can you answer the question?

A. No, it doesn't.

Q. And I would take it that, if in fact, she had told you that she had
been threatened to be killed, that you might want to report that to
some authorities, correct?

A. No, I don't do that, we don't do that on the hot line.

Q. All right.

And did you ever ask her, for example, if she was with another man,
since the threat was linked to her being with another man?

A. Oh, sure.

Q. That doesn't appear anywhere on either your contemporaneous form or
your two week later additional form, does it?

A. No.

MR. BAKER: Thank you.

REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. GELBLUM:

Q. What's the purpose for filling out the form, Ms. Ney?

A. The purpose for filling out the form are basically for statistical
purposes.

Q. Meaning what?

A. Well, we don't get our funding unless we write down certain things
on the sheet, such as the woman's name and where she lives.

Q. Is the purpose of the form to make a record for future calls?

A. No, it's not.

MR. BAKER: Objection, leading.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. GELBLUM) Your handwritten notes that you made two weeks
later --

A. Um-hum.

Q. -- did they say anything about how long Mr. Simpson -- I'm sorry --
how long -- how long Nicole had been married to her ex-husband, her
high-profile husband?

A. No. Wait a minute. Let me -- I'm sorry.

Yes it does.

Q. What does it say?

A. Just says married 8 years.

Q. Okay.

Now, why didn't you write down Nicole's report to you that she had
been threatened?

A. Basically, the reason this form is filled out for statistical
purposes only, really.

If she had said to me that -- she had told me during the conversation
she did not want to come to the shelter. I asked her whether she
wanted to come. She said no.

As soon as she said no to me -- if a woman says she wants to come to
the shelter, this form has to be filled out very -- in great detail.

Q. You then ask for the last name?

A. I don't -- yeah, if she -- yes, then at that point I would -- she
would -- would need to tell me her last name, she would need to tell
me a lot more things, but I would need to write down a lot more
things.

Q. Okay.

A. So when a woman calls and has no interest in coming to the shelter,
basically this does not need to be filled out in such great detail.

I was much more interested, at this point, in speaking to her and
seeing what her issues were, and what her problems were, and trying to
work with her than to get down the details of the -- just her little
details she was telling me.

Q. Once she told you she was not interested in coming to the shelter,
what was your goal for the rest of the conversation?

A. The goal for the rest of the conversation --

MR. BAKER: Objection, irrelevant.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. The goal for the rest of the conversation was to work on her
problem and to get her to a place where she could feel comfortable
about her decision.

I wasn't really concerned at that point on writing down the details.

Q. Why not?

A. Because it wouldn't have mattered. No one looks at these sheets
again.

Q. What's done with these sheets for people who are not going to come
into the shelter, what is done with these sheets after the call?

A. Someone takes them, writes down how many women called or what hours
they call, and basically puts them away. They're never seen again.

Q. Are they used for grant purposes?

A. Yeah, grant, and to get our money every month. We get a certain
amount of money from the city and the state.

Q. Is the level of detail, the amount of information you put on this
form, atypical, not typical of what you usually fill out for a call
when a woman is not coming into the shelter?

A. Sometimes a lot less is written down, quite frankly.

Q. Okay.

On the subject of the date --

MR. GELBLUM: Like to mark as next in order --

THE CLERK: 2225.

MR. GELBLUM: 2225.

MR. FOSTER: 4?

THE CLERK: 25 next in order.

MR. GELBLUM: Is it 5? 2225. Some calendars.

(The instruments herein described

as calendars for May 1994 and June 1994 were marked for identification
as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 2225.)

MR. GELBLUM: May I approach, Your Honor?

THE COURT: You may.

Q. (BY MR. GELBLUM) Do you recognize these calendars?

A. Yes.

Q. What are they?

A. Well, they're the schedule of who's going to be on the hot line
sessions.

Q. Okay.

And --

A. The shifts.

Q. Is your name -- does your name appear on May 7?

A. No.

Q. Does your name appear on June 7?

A. Yes.

Q. What time?

A. The 8 to 12 shift.

Q. Is that the day that you had this call with Nicole?

A. Yes.

MR. GELBLUM: I have nothing further.

MR. BAKER: Let me see that last calendar, please.

(Mr. Gelblum hands exhibit to Mr. Baker.)

RECROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. BAKER:

Q. As I understand, Mrs. Ney, the hot line sheet, this says first
assessment is not terribly relevant to get funded, right?

A. No, it's not.

Q. And yet it has filled out --

MR. BAKER: Phil, put up the first sheet.

(Exhibit 2223 is displayed.)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) It has sources to make your job easier, so that you
can identify a person and just put in basically a checklist; isn't
that correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And, for example, if someone is calling you and saying that they
are -- have been a victim of domestic violence, their age is pretty
important, is it not?

A. Not necessarily, no.

Q. Their ethnicity has no importance either?

A. Not particularly.

Q. And the details concerning the length of the relationship, that
we've already been through?

A. Um-hum.

Q. And are alcohol or drugs a part of the problem, that's not
important either? All you have to do is circle a yes or no, don't you?

A. Sometimes I don't ask these questions because there are other
things that I find, at the moment, more important, and maybe -- and it
could be I even asked her, but I don't remember, I mean I -- just in
hindsight, I didn't know that I'd be up here on the stand talking
about this, so I guess I --

Q. Okay.

But you did know you were going to be up on the stand talking about it
when you did your two week memorandum --

A. No, I didn't.

Q. Let me finish my question.

-- you did the two week memorandum to memorialize the details you
testified to in the first examination by Mr. Gelblum, to memorialize
the details of the conversation, because you said the memory fades
with time, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And you didn't include in your memorializing the details, the
crucial elements that you're now testifying to either, did you?

A. Those were my notes; not for anybody else to look at. I remember
the details that I felt were important. I didn't think anybody was
going to be looking at these.

Q. My question to you, when you wrote out the card in a totally
different pen and on a -- not going back and looking at the form or --
strike that.

Did you go back and look at the form when you wrote this --

A. No, I didn't.

Q. -- memorandum?

A. No.

Q. And so you were trying, then, to memorialize all the details,
because memory fades, and you left out the major details about the
phone call, right?

A. I was not trying to memorialize all the details.

Q. Now, Mr. Gelblum showed you some calendars, and can you tell me how
these calendars are filled out and who fills them out?

A. There's a woman who's in charge of just that, just calls the
volunteers and seeing what shifts they would like to take on which
days.

Q. And obviously, these have to do with scheduling, right?

A. Right.

Q. And these don't have anything to do with Mr. O.J. Simpson, do they?

A. Not at all.

Q. And Mr. O.J. Simpson's name doesn't appear on any of these, does
it?

A. No.

Q. Would you kindly read the top of the July 1994 calendar to the
jury. Whose name appears there?

MR. GELBLUM: June?

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) June 1994, tell them what -- just tell them what
name appears on the upper right-hand corner of that calendar. Left.

A. Can I read the note or --

Q. Can you just tell us . . .

A. O.J. Simpson. O.J. Simpson.

Q. Now, is there in that calendar any other name of any other human
being that is not connected with Sojourn House?

A. No.

Q. And that just happened to get on there?

A. I have no idea what that's doing there. The only thing I can guess
--

Q. I don't want you to guess.

A. Okay.

Q. Nor does anyone else in this courtroom.

You have no idea how my client's name is on the scheduling calendar of
June 1994 -- well --

A. I -- well, I do have an idea, yes.

Q. You can speculate?

A. 'Cause I can read what the note here --

REDIRECT EXAMINATION (Continued) BY MR. GELBLUM:

Q. Would you do that, please.

A. It says, "Calls to the hot line R-E O.J. Simpson, no comment."

Q. What do you understand that to mean?

A. That means if anyone calls the hot line about O.J. Simpson, not to
-- to say no comment. This is for everybody.

MR. GELBLUM: Thank you. Nothing further.

RECROSS-EXAMINATION (Continued) BY MR. BAKER:

Q. So as early as sometime in June of 1994, there wouldn't be any
calls to the Sojourn House unless you or somebody else had put out
this purported call of Nicole Brown Simpson?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection, calls for speculation, no foundation.

THE COURT: I don't understand the question.

MR. GELBLUM: He asked her if -- if somebody else would have any reason
to call. How would she know?

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. I did not say a word to anybody in June.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Didn't ask you whether you said a word to anybody.
Maybe my question --

MR. GELBLUM: That's the problem with the question.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) I said that was put on that calendar because someone
at Sojourn House had publicized what they wanted to publicize as a
call from Nicole Brown Simpson, true?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection, calls for speculation, assumes facts not in
evidence.

THE COURT: True. Sustained. No testimony that it was publicized.

MR. BAKER: Well, that's circumstantial evidence that it is because --

MR. GELBLUM: Pardon me.

MR. BAKER: -- The fact it's on there to deflect calls about O.J.
Simpson.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Jurors to disregard that last comment by Mr. Baker.

MR. BAKER: Nothing further, Your Honor.

MR. GELBLUM: Nothing further.

THE COURT: You may step down.

Ten-minute recess, ladies and gentlemen.

(Recess.)

(The notes of the proceedings held in chambers at this point were
ordered sealed by the Court, not to be opened, transcribed, or
destroyed except upon order of a Judge of the Superior Court.)

(The following proceedings were held in chambers, outside the presence
of the jury.)

MR. BREWER: I want to be on the record. The next witness is a Ronald
Fischman being called by the plaintiff.

We'd like to question him under 776. This is a witness who is a
recalcitrant witness. He's here on subpoena today. In order for him to
appear at the deposition he was subpoenaed. He didn't appear. There
was an O.S.C. re contempt. He didn't appear for that.

There was a body attachment that was issued and, ultimately, we were
able to secure his attendance at the deposition.

He is a friend of Mr. Simpson, has been for six years. He still is
friendly with him today. We feel under those circumstances he's an
adverse witness to our side of the case. We should be able to question
him using legal questions under 776.

MR. PETROCELLI: I would join in that, add 767 permitting him to be
questioned as a hostile witness.

THE COURT: Okay. You may.

MR. BREWER: Thank you.

(All parties exit chambers and resume their respective seats at
counsel table.)

(Jurors resume their respective seats.)

(The following proceedings were held in open court, in the presence of
the jury.)

MR. GELBLUM: Before the next witness, like to move in Exhibits 2223,
2224 and 2225.

THE COURT: All right.

(The instrument herein described was received in evidence as
Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 2223.)

(The instrument herein described was received in evidence as
Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 2224.)

(The instrument herein described was received in evidence as
Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 2225.)

THE CLERK: 2225.

THE COURT REPORTER: Okay.

MR. BREWER: Ron Fischman.

THE CLERK: The witness is Ron Fischman.

(Indicating to bailiff.)

RONALD FISCHMAN, called as a witness on behalf of Plaintiffs, pursuant
Evidence code section 776 and 767, was duly sworn and examined as
follows:

THE CLERK: You do solemnly swear that the testimony you may give in
the cause now pending before this court shall be the truth, the whole
truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

THE WITNESS: I do.

THE CLERK: Please state and spell both your first and your last name
for the record.

THE WITNESS: Dr. Ronald A., R-o-n-a-l-d A., Fischman, F-i-s-c-h-m-a-n.
DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. BREWER:

Q. Good morning, Dr. Fischman.

Dr. Fischman, you are a neurologist and an internist; is that correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. And you know Mr. Simpson, and have known him since 1990, is that
true?

A. That's correct.

Q. And in 1990, you became familiar with the Simpson family, Nicole,
O.J. Simpson and their children; is that true?

A. Yes.

Q. And a relationship developed between the children first, Nicole and
your ex-wife Cora Fischman, then you and Mr. Simpson became quite
friendly, is that true?

A. Yes.

Q. And you have remained friendly with him through today, is that
true?

A. I've -- I see him occasionally when I pick up and drop off the
children.

Q. When you see him, you talk to him, you have friendly conversation
with him, true?

A. Brief conversation.

Q. And during the time period that you've known Mr. Simpson --

MR. PETROCELLI: Can you speak into the microphone?

MR. BREWER: Yes, speak into the microphone.

Q. (BY MR. BREWER) During the time period that you've known Mr.
Simpson, you've had occasion to go to dinner with he and Nicole, true?

A. Yes.

Q. And you've had occasion to go over their house and visit; is that
true?

A. Yes.

Q. And you've also had occasion to take vacations with one another; is
that true?

A. Yes.

Q. And in fact, in 1994, you went to the Super Bowl together, true?

A. Yes.

Q. That was just you and your ex-wife Cora Fischman, Mr. Simpson and
Nicole, true?

A. Yes.

Q. And you also had a vacation together in Hawaii, true?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

And over the course of six years, you spent quite a bit of time with
Mr. Simpson, vacationing, going to dinner, visiting at their house and
so forth, true?

MR. LEONARD: Objection, leading, Your Honor.

MR. BREWER: You made a ruling in chambers.

MR. LEONARD: Okay.

THE WITNESS: Could you repeat --

MR. LEONARD: Withdrawn, Your Honor.

THE WITNESS: Would you -- could you repeat the question.

Q. (BY MR. BREWER) Over the course of the six years that you've known
Mr. Simpson, you've had ample occasion to interact with him on
vacation, going to dinner, going over to his home, going to events,
things of that nature, correct?

A. The events that you noted are the ones that existed, yes.

Q. Okay.

And while Mr. Simpson was incarcerated, you visited him on two
occasions, is that true?

A. That's correct.

Q. Now, Dr. Fischman, focusing for the moment on the two-and-a-half,
three-month period before Nicole's murder, April, May and June of
1994, you had occasion to speak with Mr. Simpson concerning his
feelings about Nicole during that time frame, true?

A. Yes.

Q. And you spoke with him both by telephone and in person, regarding
his feelings about Nicole during that time frame, true?

A. Yes.

Q. And the statements -- strike that.

Mr. Simpson told you in or about April of 1994 that the relationship
with Nicole had become a little bit rocky, true?

A. What month was that again?

Q. April of 1994.

A. Yes, I believe that's true.

Q. And Mr. Simpson had telephoned you in that same month when he was
in Puerto Rico shooting a film, the film "Frogman," true, or the pilot
"Frogman," true?

A. Yes.

Q. And he had phoned you from Puerto Rico looking for Nicole, is that
true?

A. I don't recall if he was specifically looking for Nicole.

Q. And when Mr. Simpson telephoned you and spoke with you during the
month of April, he indicated to you that he was having difficulty
communicating to Nicole, true?

A. Yes.

Q. And he also told you that Nicole wasn't available to him and would
not return his calls; he told you that, didn't he, sir?

A. He was having difficulty communicating with Nicole, yes.

Q. He also told you that Nicole was abrupt and short with him on those
occasions when they did have telephone conversations, true?

A. Yes.

Q. And he also told you that Nicole was being cold -- cold, difficult,
short and avoiding him, true?

A. She was being difficult to reach, to communicate with, yes.

Q. She was being short with him, true?

A. On occasions she would be short with him.

Q. She was cold and difficult for him to deal with, true?

A. It became increasingly more difficult during that time frame, yes.

Q. And, Dr. Fischman, Mr. Simpson told you that as a result of this,
he felt as though he was being ignored, true?

A. I don't recall that statement.

MR. LEONARD: Can I just have an objection, vague as to time with this
particular conversation.

THE COURT: Overruled. I think we're talking about April through June.

MR. BREWER: That's correct.

A. Yes. I don't recall that specific comment.

Q. (BY MR. BREWER) Okay.

Sir, you remember having a deposition taken in this case?

A. Yes.

Q. And you understood at the time of the deposition that you were
placed under oath?

A. Yes.

Q. And you were questioned by Mr. Petrocelli and myself during the
course of that deposition?

A. Yes.

Q. And you understood at the time of that deposition, that the
testimony that you provided therein had the same force and effect as
the testimony that you're giving today in court in front of this jury,
true?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. Like to read from your deposition testimony --

MR. LEONARD: Object. There's no foundation. He says he doesn't recall.
If what he's trying to do is refresh his recollection, I don't have an
objection. He said he doesn't recall.

THE COURT: You may refresh his recollection.

MR. BREWER: Let me put this on the Elmo.

(referring to transcript).

MR. LEONARD: Can we have the page.

MR. BREWER: Page 69, line 10 through 11.

MR. LEONARD: Before you put it -- just -- before you put it up, can I
have --

MR. BREWER: Yeah.

Hold one second.

MR. FOSTER: 67?

MR. BREWER: 69.

MR. LEONARD: Which line? I'm sorry.

MR. GELBLUM: 10 to 11.

MR.LEONARD: That's part of an answer. You going to read the question?

MR. BREWER: Yeah. Put the whole thing on the Elmo.

Q. (BY MR. BREWER) Read it, Dr. Fischman, see if it refreshes his
recollection.

MR. BREWER: You have any objection?

MR. LEONARD: (Nods.)

MR. BREWER: Okay.

(Transcript page is displayed.)

MR. LEONARD: I think it would make more sense to put the whole thing
in context, but go ahead.

Q. (BY MR. BREWER) I'm going to ask, Dr. Fischman, if you could look
at the answer, where it says "The Witness." And just for the moment,
read that to yourself and see if that refreshes your recollection. And
I'll reask the question.

(Pause for witness to read transcript.)

A. I said that I believe -- it says, "maybe he felt like he was being
ignored."

I think that accurately reflects my memory of that, yes.

Q. And so that refreshes your recollection, that in discussions with
Mr. Simpson, that it was your sense based upon those discussions, that
he felt as though he was being ignored by Nicole, true?

A. To the best of my recollection.

Q. Okay.

And in your discussions with Mr. Simpson during that same time frame,
you felt that -- strike that -- he indicated to you that he was
frustrated, true?

A. Yes.

Q. He indicated to you he was confused, true?

A. Yes.

Q. And he also indicated to you that he felt Nicole was rejecting him,
true?

A. I don't recall him using that word, but I'm -- I'm certain he felt
that, yeah.

Q. Okay.

And you -- when you say you're certain he felt that, that's based upon
your recollection as you sit here today of conversations you had with
O.J. Simpson in the three-month period before Nicole's death, true?

A. It's reflective of the combination of statements and conversations
we had during that time period, yes.

Q. Okay.

Now, Mr. Fischman, in June of 1994, you had occasion to have a
conversation with Nicole Brown in your kitchen, is that true?

A. Yes.

Q. And during the course of that conversation, an IRS letter came up?

MR. LEONARD: I'm going to object to this as hearsay.

MR. BREWER: Spontaneous declaration, state of mind.

MR. LEONARD: I ask he not make speaking objections. If we could
approach.

THE COURT: Approach the bench.

(The following proceedings were held at the bench, with the reporter.)

MR. LEONARD: I assume what Mr. Brewer's trying to elicit is a
statement from Nicole Brown Simpson regarding her state of mind about
IRS -- the IRS letter from Mr. Simpson.

I -- I understand Your Honor's ruling. Don't necessarily agree with
it, but I understand it.

I don't know how this fits into this state of mind exception as you
have articulated in this trial.

MR. PETROCELLI: This is a summary I'm showing you, Your Honor, of the
testimony on this point. He testified that Nicole was extremely upset
and was devastated by this letter, and it provoked an immense amount
of anger, and it's critical to the understanding of what was going on
in the last week, particularly since Mr. Simpson threatened Nicole and
followed through by sending this letter, and this letter was a key
event in what led to the final event on the 12th of June, and Nicole's
reaction to it, and what happened to the -- between the parties in the
ensuing days.

MR. LEONARD: How can he say it was a key event? The letter -- I mean
the letter is -- at best is a threat -- a financial threat at best.
What does that have to do with any potential motive to murder in this
case? I don't understand that; I've never understood that.

MR. PETROCELLI: Because Nicole disagreed with you, she said how could
he do this to the mother of his children, she was forced to leave her
home with her children. That's why.

MR. LEONARD: Yeah, and that's why -- exactly why you want it in. It
has nothing to do with motive of murder.

He just wants to smear my guy up with that statement. That's all this
is for, that's all it's for. It has no probative value. If it does,
the prejudicial value is outweighed. What the hell does that have to
--

THE COURT: What are you offering it for?

MR. PETROCELLI: Offering it to show the conduct of the parties in the
last week leading up to Nicole's death, her state of mind.

THE COURT: Conduct of which party?

MR. PETROCELLI: The conduct of Nicole Brown Simpson. Her reaction to
the letter from Mr. Simpson, what anger and hostility it provoked in
her and what she did in rejecting him the remainder of that week,
including on June 12, and why she did so. It explains her conduct,
which is highly relevant to his motive to kill her.

MR. BREWER: And let me add one thing. Because it will also help to
explain her subsequent conduct, that I will get into in a moment, at
the recital, where there is going to be testimony relative to Mr.
Simpson's interaction with Nicole Brown Simpson at the recital. This
letter is an integral part of the observations that this witness --
and the attitudes that these people expressed to one another.

MR. PETROCELLI: He specifically will testify that, unlike Simpson,
that there was a coldness, a chilliness, and no communication at all
between Simpson and Nicole, and that Nicole took the kids and whisked
them away at the end of the recital.

Excuse me, you're sitting on my tie.

(Referring to Mr. Leonard's elbow on Mr. Petrocelli's tie on side
bar.)

MR. LEONARD: I wasn't sitting on anything.

Your Honor, this is -- I mean enough is enough. This is an absolute,
pure, unadulterated attempt to smear my client. Especially this part
about the kids. I mean that's ridiculous.

This notion of a motive based upon some speculative concept that she
was mad at him and then he got mad at her, I mean, Your Honor, how far
are we going to go with this.

MR. PETROCELLI: That's for the jury to decide, not you.

MR. LEONARD: I agree. But it's also for me to point out to the Court
that at some point the probative value becomes so lessened and the
prejudicial value is too great, particularly the statement about the
kids, that it becomes inappropriate. I really feel very strongly --

MR. BREWER: Not this close to the murders.

THE COURT: It appears to the Court that the essential position of the
plaintiff is that it's being offered to show Nicole Simpson's state of
mind in terms of her relationship with the defendant, which appears to
be contrary to the version of the relationship as testified to by Mr.
Simpson, and I think, for that reason the Court will allow it.

Overruled.

(The following proceedings were held in open court in the presence of
the jury.)

Q. (BY MR. BREWER) Dr. Fischman, I want to direct your attention to a
discussion you had with Nicole a week or so before the murders,
concerning an IRS letter, in the kitchen, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. You had such a discussion, didn't you?

A. Yes.

Q. And she told you about a letter she had received from Mr. Simpson
regarding a request on his part that she not list the Rockingham
residence as her primary residence, true?

A. Yes.

MR. LEONARD: May I have a running objection.

THE COURT: Yes.

MR. LEONARD: Thank you.

Q. (BY MR. BREWER) And during the course of this conversation that you
had with Nicole, she was angry about the fact that she had received
this letter, true?

A. Yes, she stated that she was -- it wasn't a conversation, I was
listening to her. She was very upset about having received the letter.

Q. In fact, she was angrier about receiving this letter -- more angry
than she had ever been -- than you had ever seen her since you had
known her, true?

A. She was extraordinarily angry.

Q. And she told you that the reason why she was angry is she couldn't
believe Mr. Simpson would do this, to put a wife -- his ex-wife, the
mother of his children, and his children out on the street, true?

A. That part I don't recall right now.

Q. Do you recall testifying at your deposition that Nicole Simpson
said to you --

MR. LEONARD: Page and line, please.

MR. BREWER: Page 107, lines 4 through 7.

Q. (BY MR. BREWER) Do you recall saying that, sir, that she couldn't
believe O.J. would do something like that to the mother of his
children?

A. I believe that's what I said, yes.

Q. You said that -- at your deposition, under oath, that's what she
said to you in the kitchen during that conversation, true?

A. I believe that's what she said, yes.

Q. And she also indicated to you that Mr. Simpson was doing this
because he was retaliating against her because she ended the
relationship, true?

A. No, that's not true.

Q. She indicated to you that he was doing this to retaliate against
her, didn't she, sir?

A. No, that's not true.

Q. Now, Mr. Fischman, I want to move ahead to the recital.

There was a recital held on June 12, 1994, and your daughter was one
of the participants in the recital, true?

A. Yes.

Q. And the recital was to be held between 5 and 6 o'clock that
evening; is that correct?

A. Approximately, yes.

Q. And your wife -- your ex-wife was going to be there; is that
correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And you understood that Mr. Simpson and Nicole were going to be
there, true?

A. I didn't spend my time thinking about it, but yes, when I got
there, it was apparent they were going -- both going to be there.

Q. Because their daughter was also participating in the same recital,
true?

A. Yes.

Q. When you got there -- you arrived a little bit late, is that true?

A. I believe so, yes.

Q. And you went into the auditorium and you sat down with your family;
is that correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And after you sat down, you turned around and made observations --
or an observation with respect to Mr. Simpson and Nicole, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And they were seated at the rear of the theater, is that true?

A. Yes.

Q. And with respect to the observations that you made of them at that
time, you sensed that there was a chill between them, correct?

MR. LEONARD: Objection, calls for speculation and lack of foundation.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BREWER) Well, during the time period that you made
observations of them in the theater, did you ever see them speak with
one another?

A. As I said in my deposition, it was a very chaotic situation with
parents and children running all over the place. I turned around and I
believe I saw Nicole and O.J. sitting next to each other. I don't
recall them having any dialogue or conversation, but it would have
been difficult to determine that based on where I was sitting.

Q. So, sir, you never saw them embrace in the auditorium, did you?

A. Correct.

Q. You never saw them kiss, did you?

A. No.

Q. You never saw either one of them smile, did you?

A. I don't recall.

Q. In fact, you never even saw them look at one another in that
auditorium, true?

A. I don't recall. I wasn't in a position to see that as I -- as I've
explained.

Q. Um-hum.

Now, at an intermission, Dr. Fischman, you went out into the lobby and
you had a discussion with Mr. Simpson in the lobby; is that correct?

A. No. There was no break.

I think at one point I got up to stretch and O.J. was out in the lobby
also, yes.

Q. And you spoke with him for about 5 to 10 minutes; is that correct?

A. Something like that.

Q. And during that time frame, Mr. Simpson indicated to you that he
was tired, true?

A. Seemed that he was tired, yes.

Q. And in the course of four years, during that time you had seen him
tired on other occasions, hadn't you?

A. Once or twice I'd seen him.

Q. I mean you'd seen him come back from trips where he traveled out of
town and come back into town, true?

MR. LEONARD: Objection, calls for speculation.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. I may have.

Q. And during the course of having a conversation with Mr. Simpson in
the lobby, what you observed about him is that he appeared to you to
be slightly withdrawn, true?

A. Yes, he was tired, fatigued, slightly withdrawn.

Q. Subdued?

A. Yes, somewhat.

Q. And in the conversation, the brief conversation that you had with
him out in the lobby, you sensed that he was frustrated in that
conversation, true?

A. No, I don't recall him being frustrated, demonstrating any
frustration in that conversation.

Q. Okay.

A. There was, you know -- again, this was a lobby filled with children
running around, it wasn't a one-on-one communication where we were
having a heart-to-heart about the specific event or people.

MR. BREWER: Move to strike as nonresponsive, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

MR. BREWER: Can I have the deposition.

Want to put up for the defense page 296, lines 17 through 25. Would
you put that on the Elmo, please.

MR. LEONARD: I'm sorry, pages again.

MR. BREWER: Page 295 -- 296, I'm sorry. Lines 17 through 25.

MR. LEONARD: Can I -- can you hold off for a second, Steve.

MR. FOSTER: Sure.

MR. LEONARD: Okay.

MR. BREWER: Steve, go ahead.

(Page 296 from transcript displayed on Elmo.)

MR. BREWER: I'm going to start reading here.

Go to the next page. Could you go to the next page, please, I'll give
you the lines.

Okay. Right there. Go back up.

Mr. Leonard, lines 5 through 7.

Okay. Go back up so I can start at line 17.

Q. (BY MR. BREWER) All right. (Reading.) "Q. And he appeared at that
point to be slightly withdrawn, is that a fair statement?"

MR. BREWER: Your answer.

(Reading.)

"Yeah.

"Q. Did he appear to be upset?

"A. No.

"Q. Slightly upset?

"A. No.

"Q. Confused?

"A. No."

MR. BREWER: There's an objection.

(Reading.) "Q. Frustrated?"

MR. BREWER: Your answer.

(Reading.)

"I think he may have shown some frustration in the brief conversation
we had in the lobby but not afterwards."

Q. (BY MR. BREWER) Were you asked those questions, sir, and did you
give that answer?

A. Apparently, yes, I did.

Q. And that was your answer under oath in the deposition, true?

A. Yes.

Q. Do you want to change your sworn testimony today, Dr. Fischman?

MR. LEONARD: I object. That's argumentative.

THE WITNESS: Would you like to clarify it?

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. BREWER) No. Just answer my question.

Did you want to change the sworn testimony that you provided during
the course of your deposition today in front of the jury?

A. I would just say that --

Q. That's yes or no, sir?

A. I stated that throughout that time O.J. had a degree of frustration
with Nicole, yes.

Q. And that includes frustration that you sensed during your course of
interacting with him at the recital, true?

A. You're trying to make it --

Q. True, sir?

A. It wasn't. No, it wasn't true. It appeared to me that he may have
been frustrated throughout the period.

You're trying to highlight that frustration during that evening, and
honestly, that's not what I sensed.

MR. BREWER: Move to strike as nonresponsive.

THE COURT: Stricken.

Jury to disregard that answer.

Q. (BY MR. BREWER) See if you can answer my question, Dr. Fischman.

Do you want to change your sworn testimony that we just read from the
deposition transcript that he appeared to be frustrated when you spoke
with him at the recital?

Do you want to change that in front of this jury here today?

MR. LEONARD: Objection, argumentative.

A. I believe --

THE COURT: Excuse me.

A. I've answered the question.

THE COURT: Excuse me. You can answer that yes or no.

A. No.

Q. (BY MR. BREWER) Now, Dr. Fischman, after you had occasion to speak
with Mr. Simpson out in the lobby, you went back in and remained
inside the auditorium until about the end of the performance; is that
correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And then you all went outside and you gathered outside and you took
a photograph of Mr. Simpson at that time, correct?

A. Yes, I did.

MR. BREWER: Steve, could we have that -- that's 846?

MR. FOSTER: 826.

MR. BREWER: 826.

(Exhibit 826 displayed on Elmo.)

Q. (BY MR. BREWER) On the monitor we've had what's been marked and
received into evidence as Exhibit 826.

Is that a photograph that you took that day after the recital?

A. Yes, it is.

Q. And can you -- can you tell us how you came to take that
photograph?

A. At the end of the recital we all withdrew to the courtyard. Sydney
had been -- I believe she had the last routine or one of the last
routines. When they all broke, we, as I said, went to the courtyard
and Sydney came to the courtyard. Shortly thereafter, my wife had
requested that I take some pictures, and I did.

Q. So this photograph, 826, was taken because your wife had requested
that you photograph Mr. Simpson and his daughter Sydney, correct?

A. I don't recall whether she specifically asked me to take that
picture, or just take pictures as best I could.

Q. Well, Mr. Simpson didn't ask you to take a photograph?

A. That's right. Correct.

Q. It was someone else?

A. Yes.

Q. Your wife or someone else?

A. Yes.

Q. True?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

And when you took that photograph, that was a posed photograph, that
wasn't just a candid shot, true?

A. Yes.

Q. And by the way, during the course of taking that photograph, or at
any time that day, sir, did you ever notice any cuts to any portion of
Mr. Simpson's left hand?

A. No.

Q. Did you ever notice any abrasions to any portion of Mr. Simpson's
left hand, either that day or during the course of taking this
photograph?

A. No.

Q. Mr. Simpson is smiling in this photograph, true?

A. Yes.

Q. That was the first time that you observed him smile that entire
day, true?

A. I was asked this at the deposition.

I was trying to recall whether he smiled in the lobby, and I don't
recall. He may have smiled in the lobby when we met earlier. But
certainly that was the biggest smile he had during the day, yes.

Q. Sir, you were asked to recall a single time that day prior to this
photograph, in your deposition, when Mr. Simpson smiled and you
couldn't, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And the only time that you could recall Mr. Simpson smiling that
entire day was when this photograph, this posed photograph was taken
following the recital, true?

A. That this was --

Q. True?

A. He might have smiled. I don't recall.

Q. Sir, he might have smiled and he might not.

You can't recall one time -- Tell this jury one time that day he even
smiled during this joyous occasion until after -- until that
photograph was -- photograph was taken, that posed photograph?

MR. LEONARD: Objection.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. True?

A. As I've stated --

Q. Sir, true or false? True?

A. Can you repeat the question, please.

Q. You can't recall one time during the entire -- the entire recital,
this joyous occasion where your children were performing, where Mr.
Simpson smiled, except this posed photograph that was taken after the
recital?

A. At the present time that's true, yes.

Q. Now, after everyone is out and you observed Nicole pull up in her
vehicle and all of the kids piled into her car, true?

A. I honestly don't recall seeing that happen. I believe it did occur
though, yes.

Q. And the Browns were also getting themselves together and they were
all going to leave, true?

A. Yes.

Q. And Mr. Simpson came out at that time, while everyone was getting
themselves together in order to leave the performance, and go their
various ways, true?

A. Yes.

Q. And, in fact, you were going to have dinner that evening with your
wife and your family, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And at that time -- in fact, why don't we just show the videotape.
At this time we're going to show you what's Exhibit 825.

(The instrument herein described as a video of the parking area
outside of the Paul Revere Middle School was marked for identification
as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 825.)

(Exhibit 825 displayed on Elmo.)

Q. (BY MR. BREWER) Is that you, Dr. Fischman?

A. Yes, it is.

(Indicating to video.)

Q. And is that Lou Brown?

A. Yes.

Q. And O.J. Simpson?

A. Yes.

Q. That's his son he just picked up?

A. Yes, that was Justin.

Q. That's Judy Brown?

A. Yes.

MR. BREWER: Okay. Stop. Stop.

(Indicating to video.)

Q. (BY MR. BREWER) Dr. Fischman, you see there where Mr. Simpson was
smiling and laughing?

A. Yes.

Q. You shared a joke with him at that time, didn't you, you shared a
laugh together, you and Mr. Simpson, true?

A. I don't think it was a joke.

Q. In fact, you told Mr. Simpson --

MR. LEONARD: Objection, hearsay.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. You told Mr. Simpson that you were going to dinner that evening
with your wife and your family, your ex-wife, true?

A. That's correct.

Q. And you had had discussions on previous occasions with Mr. Simpson
about your own marital difficulties that you were having with your
ex-wife; is that true?

A. Yes.

Q. And when Mr. Simpson walked out of the recital, he asked you about
going to dinner with him; is that correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And when he asked you that, that's when you told him what your
plans were for the evening, that you were going to go to dinner with
your ex-wife, true?

A. Yes.

Q. And he said something like good luck; is that correct?

A. I don't recall exactly what he said.

Q. It was in the context of that conversation that Mr. Simpson is
laughing and smiling on that video, true?

A. May have been.

Q. True?

A. It may have been, yes.

Q. That's what you testified to in your deposition, Dr. Fischman,
didn't you?

A. If it's --

MR. LEONARD: I object, it's argument.

A. I don't remember the exact words.

I'll be happy to review it if you like.

MR. PETROCELLI: No speaking objections, please.

MR. LEONARD: Yes, Judge.

Q. (BY MR. BREWER) Dr. Fischman, Nicole left the recital with her
family, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And when she left the recital, that was the last time that you ever
saw her alive before her murder -- her murder only hours after the
recital; is that correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. And Mr. Simpson left the recital, correct?

A. I believe so.

Q. And the last time that you saw Mr. Simpson before Nicole was
murdered, hours after that recital, was at that recital, true?

A. Yes, that's correct.

Q. You didn't see him or speak with him after the recital?

A. No, I did not.

Q. And from everything that you were able to observe about Mr.
Simpson, based upon your observations and your interactions with him,
concerning his demeanor and appearance, in all the years that you've
known him he never appeared the way he did on June 12, 1994, at that
recital, did he, sir?

A. It's a difficult question to answer.

Q. Did he, sir?

A. He was very subdued and quiet.

Q. Sir.

A. That was not his normal state -- normal state.

Q. In all the years that you knew O.J. Simpson, he never appeared the
way he appeared at that recital to you, true?

A. That's true.

MR. BREWER: Nothing further.

THE COURT: Cross.

CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. LEONARD:

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Morning, Dr. Fischman.

A. Morning.

Q. Did you have any knowledge as of the time that you saw Mr. Simpson,
as to what his schedule had been the week before. I'm talking about on
June 12, what his schedule had been, what he had been doing that
weekend, how much activity had been involved, if -- how much sleep he
had gotten; were you aware of any of that?

A. No.

Q. Okay.

And your testimony here, in front of this jury, is that you -- when
you saw him your impression was that he was tired, right?

A. Yes.

Q. And quiet and withdrawn, correct?

A. Right.

MR. BREWER: Leading, objection.

THE COURT: I'll permit it.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Did you think there was anything inappropriate
about his demeanor or behavior?

A. No.

Q. You also -- Mr. Petrocelli asked you a number of questions about --

MR. BREWER: Misstates the evidence.

MR. LEONARD: Excuse me, Mr. Brewer. Sorry.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Mr. Brewer asked you a number of questions about
your impressions of whether or not Mr. Simpson was expressing some
type of frustration in his discussion with you on that Sunday evening.

Do you recall those questions?

A. The questions I was asked previously?

Q. Yeah.

A. Yes.

Q. You had a number of discussions during the spring, or at least
April through June, with Mr. Simpson about his relationship with
Nicole and he had expressed some frustration, right?

A. Yes.

Q. It's true that -- that the primary reason he was expressing
frustration is because she was acting erratically; is that right?
That's what Mr. Simpson told you, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And he told you that, for instance, he would have trouble dealing
with her about the children, especially if he called her in the
morning, things like that? Do you remember him telling you that kind
of thing?

A. He said that he had difficulty communicating with her, and the
children were part of that, yes.

Q. That some days she'd be up and some days she'd be down; that's what
he meant by erratic behavior when he was discussing it with you?

A. I believe so, yes.

Q. When you were talking about frustration that was exhibited to you
by Mr. Simpson, that's the thing he was mentioning to you, that's what
you were talking about when Mr. Brewer was asking you questions; is
that correct?

MR. BREWER: Objection, misstates the testimony.

THE COURT: You may rephrase it.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) When you were talking about Mr. Simpson expressing
frustration about his relationship with Nicole, his primary concern
that led to the frustration, at least to the extent that he expressed
it to you, was her erratic behavior; isn't that right?

A. Erratic behavior was certainly the central issue, yes.

Q. Okay.

It sounds to me like, at least in the discussion you had about a week
before Nicole's death, that she was -- she wasn't shy about talking
about her problems with (sic) Mr. Simpson, she was venting?

A. About Mr. Simpson or with him?

Q. With him or about him. In this regard she was talking about the IRS
letter, right?

A. When I saw her, she would talk about the problem she might be
having.

Q. Okay.

On that particular occasion, she was talking to you about something
that made her really mad at Mr. Simpson, this IRS letter?

A. Absolutely.

Q. And by the way, that would have been approximately the 6th or 7th
of June, something like that?

A. I don't recall.

I think you all have the timeline put together, and I acknowledged the
date that you had ascertained as that conversation took place.

Q. In that conversation, did she say anything to you about any
stalking by Mr. Simpson, that he was stalking her, anything like that?

A. No.

Q. Did she say that he had threatened to kill her?

A. No.

Q. Did she say that -- that she was afraid for herself, physically,
and for the children? Did she say anything like that, sir?

A. No.

Q. Now, you were asked questions about Mr. Simpson's demeanor, whether
he smiled, whether he talked to Nicole. And you tried to explain a
couple of times about your -- the difficulty you had in seeing or
observing.

Would you explain that to the jury, why it was that you couldn't
observe Nicole and O.J. for periods of time.

Can you explain that to the jury.

A. Yes.

My -- My family had obtained seats about two-thirds of the way up in
the theater. O.J. and Nicole, as noted before, were sitting in the
back. When I went in to sit with my family it was a darkened
auditorium, I got there during the performance. I only glanced back
briefly so I really wasn't in a position to observe them throughout
the performance.

Q. And Mr. Brewer asked you very vigorously about whether, and how
often Mr. Simpson was smiling.

Now, we saw on the videotape that Mr. Simpson smiled and laughed.

Do you remember that?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

And he was smiling and laughing about -- I know you don't think it was
a joke, but he thought -- I guess he thought it was funny, he was
smiling and laughing about your predicament at this time, correct?

A. I think he was trying to make light of my predicament, yes.

Q. And he never expressed anger at Nicole that night, did he, Dr.
Fischman?

A. Not in my presence, no.

Q. He was laughing about your relationship with your wife, and that's
how you left him that night; isn't that right, sir?

A. That's correct.

MR. LEONARD: Thank you.

No further questions.

REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. BREWER:

Q. Dr. Fischman, the erratic behavior that we talked about, by erratic
behavior we're talking about Nicole avoiding O.J. Simpson, true?

A. Yes, at times.

Q. We're talking about her not returning phone calls, true?

A. Yes.

Q. We're talking about her being short on the telephone with Mr.
Simpson, true?

A. True.

Q. We're talking about her being difficult to him, true?

A. Yes, true.

Q. That may be what he meant when he said she was acting erratically,
correct?

A. I believe so.

Q. Now, the conversation about Nicole's anger relative to the IRS
letter, you just happened to walk in the kitchen when Nicole was
talking to Cora about that issue; is that correct?

A. I believe that's the case, yes.

Q. And so the only thing that you heard was what you happened to
overhear as a result of -- by happenstance, being in the kitchen when
they were talking about it, true?

A. It was my kitchen. I was getting ready to go to work so, yes,
that's what I heard.

Q. Now, you didn't stay for the entire conversation, did you?

A. I don't recall, to be quite honest.

Q. If Nicole mentioned fears that she had --

MR. LEONARD: Objection, speculation.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. LEONARD: You know what, Your Honor, if we could approach --

THE COURT: No.

MR. LEONARD: Because he knows how speculating --

THE COURT: Excuse me.

Just finish your examination.

MR. BREWER: Thank you, Your Honor, I appreciate that.

Q. (BY MR. BREWER) Dr. Fischman, with respect to the recital, you did
have conversation with Mr. Simpson where you had an opportunity to
observe how he appeared, and how he was feeling that day, true?

A. There were two periods, one was the conversation that we had for 5
or 10 minutes in the lobby, as I mentioned earlier, and the second one
was what you saw on the videotape.

Q. So you had 15, 20 minutes, maybe longer, maybe shorter, of time and
interaction with Mr. Simpson that day, where you could assess the
things that you described about his appearance and demeanor, true?

A. Yes.

Q. And inside the auditorium, you anticipated from what you knew about
Nicole's state of mind and Mr. Simpson's state of mind that there
would be some tension between them that day, didn't you?

MR. LEONARD: Objection, speculation.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. LEONARD: Irrelevant.

THE COURT: Not irrelevant. Speculation. Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BREWER) Well, when you got to the auditorium and you looked
back, you were looking back, albeit briefly, to see if there was any
tension between Mr. Simpson and Nicole, true?

A. No. I didn't specifically look to see if there was any tension, no.

Q. But you made that -- you made an observation that there was a
chilling between them, that's what you testified to at your deposition
at that time, true?

A. No.

MR. LEONARD: Objection. That calls for speculation.

That question was specifically ruled on before and the objection was
sustained, Your Honor. It was an improper question.

Ask that it be stricken.

THE COURT: Stricken.

Q. (BY MR. BREWER) Inside the auditorium did you look back and make
observations about Nicole?

MR. LEONARD: Objection, asked and answered three times.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BREWER) Did Nicole ever talk to you about Mr. Simpson
beating her in 1989?

A. No.

MR. LEONARD: Your Honor, beyond the scope.

MR. BREWER: Nothing further.

THE COURT: Recross.

RECROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. LEONARD:

Q. Dr. Fischman, when Mr. Simpson was talking to you about his
frustration at Nicole's erratic behavior, he was -- he was telling you
that sometimes she wouldn't return his phone calls, sometimes she was
cold, and other -- sometimes she was fine; isn't that what he was
telling you, sir, and that's why it was erratic, correct?

MR. BREWER: Objection, misstates the testimony.

THE COURT: I'm going to sustain it. It sounds like you're testifying.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Tell us what you understood, what he told you when
he was talking about erratic behavior, sir.

MR. BREWER: Asked and answered.

MR. LEONARD: Based on -- he opened it up again.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Answer if you can.

A. You know, we're talking about two people who are having a difficult
relationship.

THE COURT: That's not an answer.

MR. BREWER: Move to strike.

THE COURT: Stricken.

A. Repeat the question, please.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) The question is describe for the jury what Mr.
Simpson was describing for you when he told you that Nicole's behavior
was erratic.

A. He was describing her attitude towards him.

Q. Okay.

And if you could -- if you could tell us in a little bit more detail
what he was telling you that -- that when he was describing her
erratic behavior?

A. The erratic behavior revolved around those issues that have been
discussed; the phone calls, the interactions, the communication,
whether they would be together or not be together. The relationship
was coming apart.

Q. Thank you very much. I appreciate that.

MR. BREWER: Nothing further.

THE COURT: Your're excused. Thank you.

MR. BREWER: Your Honor, I want to move in 825, the video.

MR. LEONARD: No objection.

THE COURT: Okay.

(The instrument herein described was received in evidence as
Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 825.)

MR. BAKER: What's the number?

THE COURT REPORTER: 825.

MR. BREWER: Yes.

MR. BLASIER: We have a motion that comes before the next witness. It's
going to take a few minutes.

THE COURT: Okay.

Ladies and gentlemen, 1:30. Don't talk about the case. Don't form or
express any opinion.

(Jurors exit courtroom.)

(The following proceedings were held in open court outside the
presence of the jury.)

MR. BLASIER: Your Honor, the next witness is Dr. Bruce Weir, who's
been called to testify to frequency numbers for DNA mixtures. I am
making a motion that he be excluded from testifying for the following
reasons:

We had a stipulation with the plaintiffs in this case, that with
respect to experts that testified in the criminal trial, if their
civil trial testimony was going to be the same, then we would save
money and time by not taking their depositions, since they weren't
going to say anything different. We relied on that in not taking Dr.
Weir's deposition.

This morning, I had a paper passed to me just across the table, giving
a whole new set of numbers, frequency numbers, that are different from
what he testified to at the criminal trial.

Further, there is one statistic on here regarding the frequency of the
combined 303, 304, 305 of the Bronco that was a completely new figure.
There was never frequency testified to about that at the criminal
trial.

Mr. Lambert indicated he used the same method but he came up with
different numbers. I asked if there were any work papers. He said, no,
he doesn't have any work papers.

Some of these numbers are substantially different. One of them with
respect to stains G1 and G2 on the Rockingham glove, the number that
he testified at the criminal trial as the most frequent occurrence was
1 in 3,000. It's now 1 in 6 billion.

These are substantial differences. We have not had any discovery on
this. We object to him -- them calling this witness at this time based
on violation of the stipulation that they signed.

MR. LAMBERT: Yes, Your Honor, Dr. Weir did testify at the criminal
trial about this very same subject matter, frequency calculation, just
to mixtures.

He's not talking about the single stains, but the mixtures only, and
the only number that wasn't presented at criminal trial was one for
the 303, 304 and 305 combination because that -- at the time that he
testified that test hadn't been done.

It was done later in the case so that's the only new mixture number
that he's testifying to.

Other than that, he's recalculated some of the mixture numbers and, in
fact, he published these results. They know them. Everyone's seen
them. They've been published in journals. That is accessible to
everyone.

It's basically the same testimony as before. The numbers are slightly
different, but it's the same methodology that he's got on the report.

In fact, you might remember, Your Honor, it was at their insistence
that mixture calculations be put into evidence. They insisted that we
put those into evidence at the beginning of the case. That's why we
are about to do it.

MR. BLASIER: Your Honor, the law requires statistics under People
versus Barney. These statistic mixtures aren't available. The
difference in 1 and 3,000 and 1 in 6 billion is a substantially new
calculation, something new.

I would move to exclude the new stain, 303, 304 and 305. I would also
move to exclude any testimony about these new numbers. We've had no
discovery about them at all.

MR. LAMBERT: Your Honor, these aren't new numbers. They've been
recalculated.

THE COURT: You just finished telling me that the test wasn't made
until later. How could they not be new numbers?

MR. LAMBERT: I agree 303, 304 and 305 is a new number. At the time of
his testimony that item had not been tested by the underlying
laboratory. Very late in the criminal case they did an RFLP test on
303, 304 and 305.

All he's done is add that one new calculation using the same
methodology that he already testified three days in the criminal trial
about -- all this methodology.

He's now calculated, used the same methodology to calculate it for
that one stain that he did for all the other mixtures. That's the only
thing that's new. And it's not even new. It's only just the same apply
to the same formula in the computer to a new set of data. So there's
nothing new about that.

THE COURT: I'm inclined not to permit him to testify unless he's
subject to a deposition.

MR. LAMBERT: If you want, Your Honor, we can present him for a
deposition, they can ask him about these numbers and we can call him
later.

THE COURT: Why can't you do that?

MR. LAMBERT: I'll willing to do that, Your Honor. We can have him this
afternoon.

MR. PETROCELLI: He can have his deposition taken this afternoon.

MR. BLASIER: I'm not prepared to do a deposition this afternoon based
on new numbers I'm given this morning with no new discovery, no work
papers.

THE COURT: Where are his work papers?

MR. LAMBERT: He doesn't have work papers.

This a computer program. He simply takes the data from the Department
of Justice that's already been presented, it's already in evidence,
and he applies the computer program to it and he gets statistics out
of it. And that's what he's prepared to testify about.

THE COURT: Okay.

When do you want to depose him?

MR. BLASIER: I can do it tomorrow.

THE COURT: Okay.

Do it tomorrow.

MR. LAMBERT: Very well, Your Honor.

MR. PETROCELLI: We have a witness. I guess he will start right after
lunch, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Okay. 1:30.

(At 11:50 A.M. a recess was taken until 1:30 P.M. of the same day.)


SANTA MONICA, CALIFORNIA
WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 4, 1996
1:40 P.M.

DEPARTMENT NO. WEQ
HON. HIROSHI FUJISAKI, JUDGE

(REGINA D. CHAVEZ, OFFICIAL REPORTER)

(The jurors resumed their respective seats.)

MR. PETROCELLI: Thank you, Your Honor.

By videotape, Plaintiffs call Paula Barbieri.

(An edited version of the videotaped deposition of Paula Barbieri was
played in open court.)

MR. PETROCELLI: Stop it for a second.

Your Honor, just for clarification, the witness, throughout most of
the deposition, kept referring to Sunday as June 11 --

MR. BAKER: I object --

MR. PETROCELLI: -- later on corrected it to June 12, because of the
video editing, wasn't able to reflect that, just so there's no
confusion.

THE COURT: Okay.

(An edited version of the videotaped deposition of Paula Barbieri
resumed playing in open court.)

MR. LEONARD: Your Honor --

MR. P. BAKER: Your Honor, we'd object. It's speculation.

MR. BAKER: I did in the depo.

MR. LEONARD: The question is, did you understand Mr. Simpson already
picked up your messages that you left on the Bentley phone.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. PETROCELLI: Your Honor, she indicates that from the --

MR. BAKER: Let's not have speaking objections, to coin your phrase.

MR. PETROCELLI: We need to be heard. They've had these designations --

MR. BAKER: Let to go to side bar.

MR. PETROCELLI: They didn't indicate to me in advance on this, and I
will -- C.C.P. requires him to counter-designate and give me the
objections. They did not do so.

THE COURT: Okay.

MR. BAKER: Does not --

THE COURT: Overruled.

(An edited version of the videotaped deposition of Paula Barbieri
resumed playing in open court.)

MR. BAKER: It's overruled.

MR. BAKER: Is it -- turn that -- wait a minute. Is it --

Turn that off.

MR. PETROCELLI: You don't run the courtroom.

THE COURT: Give me the code section.

MR. PETROCELLI: Okay. 2025. You have the code?

You have the code?

Your Honor, try 2025(l)(2)(I).

Is that an L?

And in addition, we would like to be -- to be heard on the substance
of the objection.

THE COURT: Okay.

Based on 2025(l)(2)(I), the objection is overruled.

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, we objected in the deposition. We don't have to
tell him we object again.

THE COURT: It must be in writing.

MR. BAKER: It is in writing. It's in the deposition.

MR. PETROCELLI: That's not what the Code requires.

THE COURT: It's not what the Code says.

MR. PETROCELLI: Can you rewind it a little bit

(The videotape was rewound.)

(An edited version of the videotaped deposition of Paula Barbieri
resumed playing in open court.)

(Videotape concluded playing.)

MR. P. BAKER: Can we read our portion, Judge?

MR. PETROCELLI: Your Honor, I wanted to hand the clerk, to give to
Your Honor, a copy of the deposition.

We're going to have some significant objections.

MR. BAKER: They better be in writing.

MR. PETROCELLI: These don't have to be in writing, Your Honor, because
he did not designate anything by way of videotape.

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, we are required to -- and in this proceeding,
there have been objections to interrogatories as they've come up, and
so -- or in depositions, rather, and so since it seems that the rules
are now changing, we object to any objections because they're not in
writing from Mr. Petrocelli.

MR. PETROCELLI: Your Honor, five minutes before we turned that tape
on, I got for the first time, the defense designations of what they
wanted read. I just got them about 1:30, 1:40 this afternoon.

MR. BAKER: That's what we've been doing the whole trial, is giving
designations back and forth.

MR. PETROCELLI: The rule about the video designations applies when,
obviously, you're preparing an edited tape in advance. We have some
significant objections, both substantively and to the form of the
questions, many of the topics, including beyond the scope of the -- of
the direct.

MR. BAKER: There is no beyond the scope, Your Honor, in a discovery
deposition such as this.

MR. PETROCELLI: This is trial testimony. You can read certain parts in
your case.

(Pause in proceedings for the Court to read the Code Book.)

THE COURT: The Court finds that the previous order that the court made
is restricted to the videotape portion that was viewed. That's with
respect to 2025(l)(2)(I). With respect to deposition testimony that is
not presented by videotape, the Court will utilize 2025, subdivision M
and subdivision U.

You may make your objection.

You may proceed.

(Portions of the deposition of Paula Barbieri were read by Mr. P.
Baker reading the questions and Ms. Bluestein reading the answers.)

MR. P. BAKER: Page 308, line 8. (Reading:)

"Q. Did Mr. Simpson generally carry a lot of cash?

"A. Yes.

"Q. And when I say 'a lot of cash,' Mr. Simpson usually had in excess
of $5,000 in cash on him at any given time, did he not?

"A. I never counted the money, but it was always a big sort of rubber
band around a lot of bills.

"Q. When you saw those bills, those bills were basically $100 bills,
were they not?

"A. I don't recall right now. Big bills.

"Q. All right. When you would -- strike that.

Both of you traveled a fair amount, did you not?

"A. Yes."

MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. I have a stipulation from Mr. Baker on the
fact that all these questions were leading and the -- it appears at
page 308 in the deposition transcript.

I solicited a stipulation from Mr. Baker on leading grounds. He told
me I had a standing objection. That's at page 310 of the transcript
which you have in front of you, at line 10. And just so I don't say
anything out loud, I would direct the Court's attention to page 367,
lines 13 through 19, indicating this witness's status.

(Pause for the Court to review transcript.)

THE COURT: I'll permit it.

MR. P. BAKER: Page 310, line 5. (Reading:)

"And Mr. Simpson had a grip bag that he took with him on most
occasions when he traveled, did he not?

"A. Yes."

MR. P. BAKER: Now, page 311 line -- 311, line 3. (Reading:)

In the black bag that Mr. Simpson had, he almost always had his
passport in there, did he not?

"A. Yes.

"Q. It was customary for him to have his passport wherever he went?

"A. Yes.

"Q. Now, did you usually carry a passport?

"A. I usually always do, except today.

"Q. All right. And we talked about Mr. Simpson's golf a little bit. He
was an avid golfer, was he not?

"A. Yeah.

"Q. That look is exactly the same look I get from my wife, by the way.

"In any event, he would usually get up, if you were there, if you
knew, early in the morning to go play golf, would he not?

"A. Before the sun came up.

"Q. And that was usually Saturday and Sunday at the very minimum, was
it not?

"A. Every day.

"Q. Okay. All right. And were you ever aware of Mr. Simpson planning
to use a disguise when he would take his children different places?

"A. I believe I testified already in the Grand Jury to the Knotts
Berry Farm, if I remember correctly, that at the video shoot, the
video makeup girl there was helping him with something that he was
doing with his children. I can't be specific.

"Q. Did O.J. ever indicate to you that he would wear those disguises
so he wouldn't have to give autographs and he could spend some time
with his children?"

MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. Hearsay.

THE COURT: Overruled.

(Reading continued:)

"A. Something about getting a tired hand.

"Q. Tired hand?

"A. A cast or something."

MR. P. BAKER: Page 314, line 17. (Reading:)

"Q. Okay. In terms of your relationship with Mr. Simpson resuming in
May of 1994, that was after Mother's Day, was it not?

"A. Yes, I was looking on my calendar. Is that what I pointed out to
be the 10th?

"Q. The 10th was -- Mother's Day, it appears to be on your calendar
the 8th.

"A. All right."

MR. P. BAKER: Page 315, line 8. (Reading:)

"Q. You saw Mr. Simpson for a total during that month-long period,
just over a month long, for a total period of about a week and a half;
is that right?

"A. You mean 12 days. When I said 12 days, I was saying over the
period of time that many days, yes.

"Q. Right. And that period of time, both you and Mr. Simpson were
traveling a fair amount, were you not?

"A. Yes.

"Q. And when you ultimately decided to break off the relationship, as
you say on June 12th, that wasn't the first time in that period of one
month that you had decided that the relationship may not go on; isn't
that correct?

"A. I don't remember.

"Q. In May of 1994?

"A. Yes.

"Q. In May of 1994, you went to Palm Springs with Mr. Simpson, did you
not?

"A. Yes.

"Q. And at that time, had you or he indicated that maybe the
relationship would not continue?

"A. Yes, actually.

"Q. And who was it that indicated the relationship may not continue at
that time?

"A. Me.

"Q. All right. And yet the relationship did continue, did it not?

"A. Yes."

MR. P. BAKER: Page 317, line 15. (Reading:)

"Q. Now, in looking at May of 1994, you circled May 10th?

"A. Yes, sir.

"Q. Is that the day, to your best recollection, that you and Mr.
Simpson resumed your relationship?

"A. Speaking, yes.

"Q. All right. The next day you went to Las Vegas. Is that true?

"A. Yes, sir.

"Q. And stayed in Las Vegas until May 14th?

"A. Yes, sir.

"Q. And at that period of time, do you have a recollection of whether
Mr. Simpson was in New York?

"A. Yes, playing golf, I think.

"Q. Well, was that New York?

"A. Yes.

"Q. All right. And then you picked him up on the 16th, correct?

"A. Yes, sir.

"Q. And then the week of the 16th, were you both out of town?

"A. The week of the 16th I was in town.

"Q. You have a recollection if Mr. Simpson was in town?

"A. I don't recall.

"Q. All right. And in terms of the weekend of the 20th, do you have a
recollection if Mr. Simpson was in town or out of town the weekend of
the 20th, 21st?

"A. Yes. I saw him somewhere in there from the 19th to the 21st. I
can't remember where."

MR. P. BAKER: Page 322, line 2. (Reading:)

"Q. I want to talk to you a little bit about, again, Mr. Simpson's
conduct relative to a cell phone, and you discussed earlier that he
had a portable phone. Do you remember that?

"A. Yes.

"Q. And he had a cradle in the Bronco for the phone, did he not?

"A. Yes.

"Q. And he had a cradle in the Bentley for the cell phone, did he not?

"A. Yes.

"Q. And around the house he used the cell phone kind of as some people
would use a --

"A. Portable phone.

"Q. Yeah, a portable phone that's hooked to a -- or a cordless phone.
Right?

"A. Yeah.

"Q. And it was common for him to have that phone with him and just
dial rather than to go to a phone in the house. Isn't that true?

"A. Sometimes he'd sit in his driveway and talk on that phone for a
long period of time, or in front of my house if we drove in front of
the apartment. So I don't know.

"Q. And it was common for him to use that and to move that from
vehicle to vehicle and keep it on his person, as well, was it not?

"A. Yes, sir.

"Q. In other words, when he traveled, he took the cell phone with him,
did he not?

"A. Yes, sir.

"Q. And to your knowledge, he had one cell phone, did he not?

"A. Yes, sir.

"Q. Okay. Now, I want to go to that call that you made on June 12,
1994, and you suggested that you indicated to the message of the cell
phone that it wasn't working and it was over, words to that effect?

"A. Yes, sir.

"Q. And you don't have, even as you sit here today, any knowledge
whether he picked that message up, do you?

"A. No, sir."

MR. P. BAKER: Page 325, line 11. (Reading:)

"Q. Now, in terms of your conversation with Mr. Simpson, I want to
again go back to the night of the 11th.

Mr. Simpson picked you up at your house, did he not?

"A. Yes, sir.

"Q. And at that time, you went to the party for the then First Lady of
Israel. Correct?

"A. Yes.

"Q. And you had a fine time.

There were no problems. Isn't that true?

"A. Just fine.

"Q. And you had no arguments with Mr. Simpson the night of the 11th at
all, did you?

"A. No, sir.

"Q. And Mr. Simpson's mood was jovial. There was nothing wrong with
his mood. Correct?

"A. True.

"Q. And there was nothing that you discerned in the messages that you
received on the day of the 12th that was anything at all unusual.
Isn't that true?

"A. True. That I remember, I don't remember what was in the messages.

"Q. I understand. But there was nothing --

"A. Specifically.

"Q. -- that would trigger your memory that he was angry or upset or
anything else.

"A. No, sir.

"Q. Isn't that correct?

"A. Correct."

MR. P. BAKER: Page 328, line 10. (Reading:)

"Q. Well, you and Mr. Simpson had a relationship, even when you were
going together, that that was a relationship that you didn't check on
where everybody -- each other was every minute of the day. Isn't that
true?

"A. True.

"Q. As a matter of fact, your relationship was one that, for example,
on June 11th, you were aware that Mr. Simpson -- that's 1994 -- that
Mr. Simpson was going to Chicago.

Correct?

"A. Yes, sir.

"Q. And you were further aware that he was going to come back and you
and he had made plans to go to San Francisco on Wednesday, which would
have been the 15th. Isn't that right?

"A. We discussed going to San Francisco -- his going to San Francisco,
yes.

"Q. Do you have any recollection of any discussion with Mr. Simpson on
the 11th, or even before that, where you were going to be on the week
of the June 12th or June 13th, whether it was going to be Vegas,
Arizona, or either place?

"A. Yes. I testified to that.

"Q. Do you have a recollection of telling him on the 11th that Arizona
had been canceled and you're absolutely going to Las Vegas?

"A. I don't remember.

"Q. So you as you sit here today, do you have any knowledge that you
informed Mr. Simpson that you were going, on June 12, 1994, to Las
Vegas on that day?

"A. No.

"Q. And that was -- you had kind of a relationship that both of you
would go different places and then call or check in with each other,
would you not?

"A. Pardon me. You're asking me if I had ever told him that I was
going to Arizona or Las Vegas? "Yes, I did.

"Q. No, I understand that --

"A. Okay.

"Q. -- but my question was -- perhaps it was a poor one -- my question
was: Had you told him positively you weren't going to Arizona and you
were in fact going to Las Vegas and you were going there on June 12th?

"A. No."

MR. P. BAKER: Page 332, line 6.

"Q. And then you had not seen him from the 6th to the 10th until you
picked him up at the airport. Correct?

"A. Yes.

"Q. And you had some telephonic communication between that period of
time. True?

"A. Yes.

"Q. It was during that week that he indicated to you that he wanted to
get back because did want to go to the dinner for the First Lady of
Israel and he wanted to go to the recital for Sydney, did he not?

"A. Yes.

"Q. And as I think you suggested, he never indicated to you that you
should be present. It was one of those things where that was more or
less a family affair, was it not?

"A. Yes.

"Q. All right. And Mr. Simpson -- you had indicated to Mr. Simpson
that you would probably be in Arizona --

"A. Yes.

"Q. -- that evening, had you not?

"A. Yes.

"Q. Now, in terms of your understanding of Mr. Simpson's schedule on
the 12th, he was going to play golf in the morning. Correct?

"A. Yes.

"Q. And that's what you discussed at least on the night of June 11th.
Correct?

"A. Yes.

"Q. That was kind of customary, certainly on Sunday morning, for him
to play golf and get up before dawn. Right?

"A. Yes.

"Q. And then you knew that after golf, he would be at some point in
time going to the recital. Correct?

"A. Yes.

"Q. Now, did you know what time the recital was?

"A. No.

"Q. And then you were aware that he had a plane to catch sometime
thereafter. True?

"A. Yes.

"Q. Do you know what time the plane was that he was supposed to catch?

"A. No.

"Q. I am looking at your face, and you're kind of grimacing in pain.

"A. My back's hurting."

MR. P. BAKER: Go to page 342.

MR. PETROCELLI: Which I may have some objections here.

Which line?

MR. P. BAKER: 342, line 8.

MR. PETROCELLI: Your Honor, if you want to read this question, I
object to it. It's beyond the scope, and they can read it in their
case, if they want.

I don't think it's relevant, either.

It's 342, line 8.

MR. P. BAKER: To -- 342, line 8, to 343, line 22.

MR. PETROCELLI: In addition, they're self-serving hearsay in answer to
the ensuing questions, plus relevance.

THE COURT: Overruled.

MR. P. BAKER: 342, line 8. (Reading:)

"Q. All right. Now. In the entire time that you had been with Mr.
Simpson as a friend or a girlfriend or whatever, had you ever seen Mr.
Simpson exhibit any signs of violence?

"A. No.

"Q. Did you ever believe he was a violent man?

"A. No.

"Q. Did he ever indicate in the entire time that you and he had a
relationship, albeit '93 or '94 that -- was he critical of Nicole in
any way, shape or form?

"A. We didn't talk about Nicole.

"Q. And so he had never said anything to your knowledge that was
critical of her. Correct?

"A. No.

"Q. Had he ever indicated to you that he thought she was -- she was a
good mother to his children?

"A. Yes.

"Q. And on how many occasions had he mentioned to you that he thought
she was a good mother to his children?

"A. I don't recall, but I have heard him say that sometime.

"Q. I want to go to this issue of whether or not he had ever indicated
a denial of killing Nicole or Ron Goldman.

"You and he at times, after he was in jail, studied the bible
together, did you not?

"A. Yes.

"Q. And you had a conversation with him while you were studying the
bible, when he said, 'Why is God doing this to me? I didn't do it. I
never killed anyone.'

"A. Yes."

MR. PETROCELLI: Objection.

MR. BAKER: That was not an infrequent subject.

MR. PETROCELLI: That's objectionable hearsay. That's absolutely
self-serving hearsay.

THE COURT: That's self-serving. Sustained.

MR. P. BAKER: Page 362, line 1.

MR. PETROCELLI: May that be stricken?

THE COURT: Stricken.

MR. PETROCELLI: Where, Mr. Baker?

MR. P. BAKER: 362, line 1.

MR. PETROCELLI: Okay.

MR. P. BAKER: I'm sorry. That was already read. We're done.

MR. PETROCELLI: I think a little redirect at 362, line 1.

MR. PETROCELLI: (Reading:)

"Q. Now, in response to some questions by Mr. Baker about the messages
you -- that Mr. -- that you left Mr. Simpson on the morning of June 12
at 7:00 o'clock a.m. message.

"Do you remember that message?

"A. Yes, sir.

"Q. I think Mr. Baker asked you if you knew if Mr. Simpson had ever
picked that message up.

"Do you remember that question?

"A. Yes, sir.

"Q. And you responded that you didn't know.

"Do you remember your answer?

"A. Yes, sir.

"Q. But you testified earlier today, did you not, that by Mr.
Simpson's three messages to you, you could tell he had picked up your
earlier message. Correct?

"A. I believe I said I assumed.

"Q. You assumed it because Mr. Simpson said in words or in substance,
'What happened now? Last night we were talking about a house full of
kids.' Is that correct?

"A. Yes, sir.

"Q. So it's your belief that he had picked up your earlier message of
7 o'clock. Correct?

"A. I assume.

"Q. That's your belief?

"A. Yes, sir."

MR. PETROCELLI: Thank you.

No further redirect.

MR. P. BAKER: Nothing further.

THE COURT: Ten minutes, ladies and gentlemen.

Don't discuss the case; don't form or express any opinions.

(Recess.)

(The following proceedings were held in open court, outside the
presence of the jury.)

MR. BLASIER: With respect to the deposition tomorrow of Dr. Weir, I
would ask that the plaintiffs, since we obviously haven't had a chance
to generate any -- I'd ask the Court to order the plaintiff to produce
the publication that Mr. Lambert referred to from which these new
numbers come from, as well as the computer program that he referred to
as being used to generate these numbers, the underlying data that went
into the numbers, and the new calculations in a form that my experts
can look at.

MR. PETROCELLI: Mr. Lambert went back to check with the witness on
producing this computer program. I do not know whether the witness has
access to this publication, nor do I know anything else about this
witness.

MR. BAKER: Could you be more vague?

(Laughter.)

MR. PETROCELLI: Your Honor -- in other words, Your Honor, we're
checking on it right now. Maybe we could defer this until Mr. Lambert
comes back at the break. I'll give him a call. We'll try to --
whatever he has, we'll produce.

MR. BLASIER: But the problem is --

MR. PETROCELLI: I may not have the publication.

MR. BLASIER: If we had known about this in advance, we could good
given him notice to produce it what we ordinarily do. If he can't
produce it tomorrow, we're going to object to him testifying at all.

MR. PETROCELLI: Whatever he has, we'll produce.

We're not going to stand on any notice requirement.

MR. BLASIER: We are.

THE COURT: Well --

MR. PETROCELLI: Can't produce what he doesn't have, Mr. Blasier, is
all I'm saying.

THE COURT: Mr. Petrocelli, you obviously had it at one time.

MR. PETROCELLI: Whatever he has, Your Honor, we'll get it.

THE COURT: And I presume he must still have access to it. So I will
order him to produce it for the deposition. If he doesn't have it at
the deposition, the Court will have to take remedial steps to correct
that problem.

And if it's still your desire to use his testimony, it may be that
you're not going to be able to use it when you want to use it.

MR. PETROCELLI: I'm a little disadvantaged in responding to the
Court's questions, but I understand the Court's order.

THE COURT: The question is -- it's not a statement. It's -- I'm
telling you, if it's not produced and the deposition will have to be
deferred, if that's -- if it's your desire to persist in -- your
desire to produce that witness, you may have to produce it at some
subsequent time.

MR. PETROCELLI: Okay, Your Honor.

THE COURT: But I'm not going to deny the defense the opportunity to
utilize all of the documentation or materials that the expert used in
arriving at his figures in conjunction with their deposition.

MR. PETROCELLI: Okay.

MR. BLASIER: Thank you, Your honor.

THE COURT: Are you ready otherwise?

MS. MOLINARO: Yes.

MR. PETROCELLI: We call Leslie Gardner.

THE COURT: We don't have a jury.

MR. PETROCELLI: Okay. It's getting late, Your Honor.

(Jurors resume their respective seats.)

MS. MOLINARO: Thank you, Your Honor.

We call Leslie Gardner.

LESLIE GARDNER, called as a witness on behalf of Plaintiffs, was duly

A. The gate would --

MR. LEONARD: Same objection.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Excuse me?

Do you recognize that gate there that's opened in that photograph?

MR. PETROCELLI: Can you make it a little better focused than that.

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Do you recognize the gate?

A. That looks like the Ashford gate.

Q. Okay.

Do you recognize the animal?

A. Yes.

Q. Who is it?

A. It's Chachi.

Q. Okay.

In all the times that you picked up -- went to Mr. Simpson's house and
went into the gates, did you ever once see Chachi walk or run outside?

MR. LEONARD: Leading, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. No.

Q. Did you ever receive any instructions from Mr. Simpson about
watching out for Chachi?

A. No.

Q. Did you ever receive any instructions from anyone about watching
out for Chachi?

MR. LEONARD: Same objection, leading, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. No.

Q. Excuse me.

Did you ever see, by the way, that dog run anywhere?

A. No.

Q. The times you picked up Mr. Simpson when the -- when you would buzz
the intercom, you indicated the gates were -- would then be opened for
you at Ashford, right?

A. There's correct.

when you were -- you would exit the property?

A. No.

MR. PETROCELLI: I have nothing further.

THE COURT: Cross.

CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. LEONARD:

Q. Good afternoon.

A. Good afternoon.

Q. Let's talk a little bit about Mr. Simpson's habit when you would
pick him up, what he would normally do and how he would normally act.

It's true, isn't it, that often when you would pick Mr. Simpson up,
things were a little chaotic, he'd be hurrying around, picking up
things?

A. That's true.

Q. Right.

It wasn't uncommon for him to come in and out of the house, grab an
item, come out, grab something else, put it in the car, so forth and
so on; he was rushing, right?

A. He was rushing. He usually didn't put stuff in the bags.

Q. Excuse me?

A. He didn't -- he didn't usually fill -- usually Michele would put
something in the bag. I don't recall O.J. putting -- coming out with
like a couple of shirts and putting them in a bag. Rarely.

Q. Now, you said you've picked him up something like 100 times --

A. That's correct.

Q. -- is that right?

Is it fair to say that the vast majority of the times that you picked
him up, Michele was there or Gigi, one of the housekeepers?

A. Yes.

Q. What you're saying is that, typically, if the housekeeper's there.
They might be taking care of putting any last-minute items in Mr.
Simpson's bag, as opposed to Mr. Simpson, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. Okay.

But he was the kind of guy -- as a limousine driver he might make you
a little bit nervous about getting someplace on time; is that fair to
say?

In other words, he wouldn't always give you enough -- as much time as
you'd like to get to where you're supposed to go; is that fair to say?
Cut it close?

A. Yeah.

Q. Okay.

In fact, about a week before June 12 you had picked him up -- you
picked him up and you were taking him on a trip out to LAX, had about
45 minutes to make the flight.

Do you remember that?

A. Yes.

Q. That was kind of rushed, wasn't it?

A. Not really.

Q. Do you remember on that occasion that you -- and occasions prior to
that, having the feeling about Mr. Simpson as a passenger. That you
were really cutting it close?

A. He -- I think he felt that way, that he was cutting it real close,
because when he'd get in the car he'd say, we gotta go, we got a go.

Q. Okay.

A. But in actuality we would make the airport with usually plenty of
time.

Q. The bottom line is there was a lot of rushing around?

A. Yeah, there was.

Q. Okay.

Let me see if I can understand some of the things you were saying.

You would -- you would buzz, and I guess in the vast majority of times
when you buzz, Michele or even one of Mr. Simpson's adult children,
Arnelle or Jason, might come out and open the gate, right, vast
majority?

A. Come out and open the gate?

Q. Or buzz the gate open, right?

A. Yes. Nobody --

Q. In other words, you would -- go ahead.

A. I don't recall someone actually coming out and opening the gate,
except for a time when Michele came out, when I think the gate was not
working properly.

Q. Okay.

But the vast majority of the hundred times that you went out to pick
up Mr. Simpson and you buzzed you would be talking to Michele, right?

A. Yes.

Q. Or one of the other housekeepers, right?

A. Yeah.

Q. Gigi after her?

A. Yeah.

Q. And when -- on occasion, when you would buzz and Mr. Simpson
responded, he wouldn't always respond -- you're not saying before this
jury that he would respond on the first buzz on every occasion, are
you?

A. He didn't respond necessarily on the first buzz, but he responded
on the first attempt to buzz him. In other words, I would ring it once
and I'd wait maybe 10 seconds. Then I would buzz it again, maybe wait
10 more seconds, and buzz it a third time, and by that third time I
always had a response from somebody.

Q. Now -- okay.

From somebody. That might be Michele or someone else that's in the
house, right?

A. Right.

Q. Okay.

By the way, you obviously didn't pick Mr. Simpson up on the 12th, that
was a fellow that was working for you; is that right?

A. That's correct.

Q. You have no idea what Mr. Simpson was doing when he was buzzed that
night, you don't know whether he was in the shower or what --

A. No.

Q. -- correct?

All right.

Now, let's talk about the dog.

You have no idea -- and I guess Mr. Simpson never discussed this with
you -- you have no idea of any complaints that Mr. Simpson got from
his neighbors to the ASPCA with regard to his dogs wandering the
neighborhood?

MR. PETROCELLI: Arguing. No foundation.

A. No.

THE COURT: This --

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) And there was -- there was -- are you aware that
there was another dog that would be at the Rockford (sic) location
from time to time, are you aware of that?

A. No.

MR. PETROCELLI: Rockingham.

Q. Excuse me. Rockingham.

A. Yes.

Q. Now, you say that you never had any discussion with Mr. Simpson
about the dogs.

Were you ever there when the other dog was at the location?

A. Yes.

Q. Of the hundred times you were there, how often were you there that
the dog was there?

I guess that didn't make --

MR. PETROCELLI: I'm going to object. The undisputed evidence is there
was only one dog there, Chachi, that night.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. PETROCELLI: No other dogs involved.

MR. LEONARD: This goes to Mr. Simpson's state of mind.

MR. PETROCELLI: There was no other dog there.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. LEONARD: I don't have any other questions.

MR. PETROCELLI: Nothing.

THE COURT: Thank you.

MR. PETROCELLI: Thank you.

THE COURT: How many more do you have?

MR. PETROCELLI: We're going to read depos.

Oh. Randy Petee, Your Honor. Call Randy Petee.

THE COURT: How long is this witness?

MR. PETROCELLI: About 15 minutes.

Good time for a break?

THE COURT: Yeah. Ten minutes.

(The jurors resumed their respective seats.)

MR. GELBLUM: Randy Petee, Your Honor.

RANDALL PETEE was called as a witness by the Plaintiffs, having been
first duly sworn, was examined and testified as follows:

THE CLERK: You do solemnly swear that the testimony you may give in
the cause now pending before this court shall be the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

THE WITNESS: I do.

THE CLERK: And, sir, would you please state and spell your name for
the record.

THE WITNESS: Randall Petee, R-A-N-D-A-L-L P-E-T-E-E.

DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. GELBLUM:

Q. What is your occupation, Mr. Petee?

A. I'm a private investigator with the firm Gailey and Associates,
G-A-I-L-E-Y.

Q. Did you do any work related to this case this past Sunday night,
Mr. Petee?

A. Yes.

Q. What did you do?

A. I was given an assignment.

MR. BAKER: I would object. I want to approach.

THE COURT: All right.

(The following proceedings were held at the bench, with the reporter.)

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, apparently Mr. Petee, who is a private
investigator, made certain round trips last Sunday night to and from
875 Bundy, the alley, to various routes.

We were just given this piece of paper in the last 30 minutes and --
and so he is not a percipient witness, because he didn't see anything.

He's got to be an expert witness for driving his car. He was not
designated as an expert. And this is after the joint pretrial
statement. And he's here to testify as to how much time it took on
various routes. And I object to it.

You can't have pretrial discovery frozen and have their guy go out
Sunday night and do this particular experiment, and come in here and
present it to the jury. I think that's inappropriate under the
pretrial order and orders of this Court and the -- and the expert
designation.

MR. GELBLUM: Expert witness? He drove his client. How long it took.
There's no expertise. It's a five-minute witness.

THE COURT: Number one, I don't consider this an expert.

Number two the streets are still there and you certainly have ample
opportunities to run your own --

MR. BAKER: That isn't the purpose of the discovery statute, number
one.

Number two, things have changed, like he goes to barricade 360 North
Rockingham. That barricade wasn't there on June 24th.

MR. GELBLUM: He goes and comes around. That's cross.

MR. BAKER: That isn't cross; that's -- this is ambush. That's what
discovery is for.

THE COURT: This is -- I frankly say, this is very de minimus.

Overruled.

(The following proceedings were held in open court, in the presence of
the jury.)

Q. (BY MR. GELBLUM) What did you do on Sunday night, Mr. Petee?

A. I was given an assignment to conduct a time-and-mileage check to
determine travel time and mileage from 875 South Bundy to 360 North
Rockingham.

Q. Okay.

And what kind of car were you driving?

A. A 1994 Honda Accord.

Q. How many cylinders is that?

A. Four cylinders.

Q. Are you familiar with this area, with these routes?

A. No, I am not.

Q. And did you drive several different routes from 875 South Bundy to
360 North Rockingham?

A. Yes.

Q. And did you drive at different speeds?

A. Yes.

Q. And did you record the time and mileage for each route that you
took?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

There should be a pointer right in front of you there, sir.

Could you -- would you take that and step over to the board we've put
up, which is exhibit next in order, 2227.

(The instrument herein referred to

as a board entitled Map of Brentwood Area was marked for
identification as Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 2227.)

Q. (BY MR. GELBLUM) Can you describe -- how many different routes did
you drive, sir?

A. There was a total of three routes.

Q. Okay.

Can you show the jury -- use the pointer and the map, Exhibit 2227 --
the first route that you took.

A. The first route?

Q. The red dot, down towards the lower right is 875 South Bundy, and
the dot up at the top left is 360 North Rockingham.

A. Starting on Dorothy Street --

Q. You can extend that pointer so you can stand around so the jurors
can see.

A? Starting on Dorothy Street, just west of Bundy Drive, and at the
north-south alley that serves the rear of 875 Bundy, I traveled
eastbound to Bundy, turned right; now, travel southbound on Bundy to
Mayfield, making a right turn on Mayfield.

Q. Did you -- could you trace that on the map, sir.

A. Down here.

(Witness indicates route taken on Exhibit 2227.)

Q. Making a right turn on Mayfield, traveling westbound to Gretna
Green, making another right-hand turn, now traveling all the way to
San Vicente.

At San Vicente, I made a left-hand turn, traveling westbound, to
Avondale, A-V-O-N-D-A-L-E.

From Avondale, I traveled northbound. It doesn't show on the map here,
but Avondale merges into Rockingham.

Q. Is that merger north or south of Sunset?

A. It merges south, south of Sunset.

Q. Okay.

A. Once I was on Rockingham, after the merge, I traveled to Sunset.
It's not shown on the map, but it should be in this general area here.
(Indicating.)

Q. Up to the left side of the map?

A. Right.

I traveled -- I turned right now, traveling eastbound on Sunset, and I
stopped at -- there's a barricade that is now in place on the north
side of Sunset at Rockingham.

Q. Can you point that out, that location on the map?

A. The barricade would be right here. (Indicating.)

Q. And does that barricade prevent entrance onto Rockingham from
Sunset?

A. Yes, it does.

Q. Okay.

What did you do once you got there?

A. That was my first route. I traveled that route the first time at
the speed limit. Second time I did it at accelerated speeds.

Q. When you say the speed limit, were you literally driving at the
posted speed limits, sir?

A. Yes, I was.

Q. And what are the speed limits in the area you were driving in?

A. On Dorothy, it's not posted. Residential streets that are not
posted, the speed limit is 25.

Bundy, it's 30 miles -- 30 miles an hour in the area that I traveled.
It does change in different parts, but it was 30 miles posted just
south of -- I mean on Bundy, just south of Mayfield.

Traveling to Gretna Green, it's also 25. But when you come up to the
three -- the first three streets, there's a 15-mile-an-hour marking
for speed bumps, which are not on the street at this time. I don't
know if they were there or they're going to be installed there.

Continuing on, 25, going up Gretna Green, there's a school located
right here (indicating), so the speed limit is 25 miles an hour
because of the school.

And then on San Vicente, it's 35 miles an hour. I believe it's posted
three times from Gretna Green to Avondale, as soon as you turn onto
Avondale, it's posted 25.

Traveling up Avondale to Rocking -- I mean to Rockingham, I don't
recall seeing any other posted signs. But from the merge at Rockingham
to Sunset, there's four speed bumps where they are posted at 20 miles
-- at 15 miles an hour.

Traveling onto Sunset, Sunset is a 35 -- it is posted 35, but some of
the curves, it's down, posted at 25.

Q. And you actually traveled that at or below all those speed limits?

A. Yes.

Q. On the one -- one time you did it?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

And did you stop at all stop signs?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Full stops?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

And did you time how long it took you to do that route at the speed
limits and stopping at the stop signs?

A. Yes.

Q. How long did it take you?

A. I believe it was five minutes and 51 seconds.

Q. Did you make some notes?

A. Yes, I did. MR. GELBLUM: I'd like to mark next in order, Exhibit
2228, Your Honor.

(The instrument herein referred to

as Notes prepared by Mr. Petee was marked for identification as
Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 2228.)

Q. (BY MR. GELBLUM) Are these the typed-up version of the notes you
made?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, did you do that same -- did you do that same route not obeying
the speed limits?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. And how fast did you go?

A. My speeds fluctuated due to acceleration, deceleration, coming to
stop signs, curvatures in the roadway. And just the roadway itself
would allow faster speeds than on other parts of the roadway.

I traveled on the accelerated speeds, I would say, in the residential
areas, between 30 to 45 miles an hour. On San Vicente, I was able to
get up to 60 miles an hour.

Q. Were you going as fast as you possibly could?

A. No.

MR. GELBLUM: Can I ask for immunity for this witness, Your Honor,
breaking the speed limit?

MR. BAKER: Absolutely not.

(Laughter.)

Q. (BY MR. GELBLUM) And did you come to full stops at the stop signs
when you were doing the route in that manner?

A. No.

Q. Did you stop at all?

A. Yes.

Q. Slow down?

A. I slowed down there. I guess can you call them rolling stops.

Q. Okay.

And traveling in that manner on this first route that you've
described, up Avondale, how long did that take you to get to the
barricade at Rockingham?

A. That took me three minutes and 31 seconds, approximately.

Q. How were you timing yourself?

A. With a stopwatch.

Q. Did you then continue on to 360 North Rockingham?

A. Yes.

Q. How did you do that?

A. This was the first route of travel, so it had to be broken down in
two parts. So after I completed the speed-limit test, and then the
accelerated speed, I had to move -- position my vehicle around to
Rockingham, and I backed up into the barricade -- that's, again,
located on Sunset and Rockingham -- and I conducted a test from the
barricade up to 360 Rockingham.

Q. And how many times did you do that?

A. I did that three times.

Q. And did you do that again at the speed limit and breaking the speed
limit?

A. Yes.

Q. And how long did it take you at the speed limit?

A. At the speed limit, it took me approximately 46 seconds.

Q. Okay.

Then you went the faster the method?

A. Yes. Traveling that, 46 seconds.

I stopped the stopwatch at Rockingham and Ashford.

Then my second test at accelerated speeds, which was approximately 35
seconds, I stopped the stopwatch at this starting point, being at
Sunset and Rockingham, to the Rockingham gate.

Again, that took me approximately 35 seconds.

And then I get I did a third test, again starting at the same starting
point to the Ashford gate. And that took me approximately 37 seconds.

Q. Okay.

So, on the -- combining the two segments of this trip at the
accelerated speeds, what was the total time from 875 South Bundy to
360 North Rockingham?

A. I didn't -- I don't have the -- I did not add it up.

Q. The first time is three minutes and 31 seconds, right?

A. Right.

Q. And the second was about 35 seconds?

A. Right.

Q. So, I believe 406?

A. Approximately four minutes and six seconds.

Q. There's a dead stop at the barrier at Rockingham?

A. Yes.

Q. Do you know whether that barrier was there in June of 1994?

A. No, I do not.

Q. Now, did you take a a second route?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Can you just trace that route for the jury.

A. Second route, again starting at the same starting point on Dorothy
at the alleyway, traveling again to Bundy, southbound on Bundy to
Mayfield, westbound on Mayfield to Gretna Green, northbound on Gretna
Green to San Vincenti, westbound on San Vincenti to Bristol.

And if I can find Bristol, right here. (Indicating.)

And then right turn onto Bristol, now traveling northbound through
Sunset to Highwood, and then a left turn. Now westbound on Highwood to
Rockingham, and then to 360 Rockingham.

Q. Did you drive that both at the speed limit -- in the speed-limit
manner and in the accelerated manner?

A. Yes.

Q. How long did the speed-limit manner take you?

A. I'll check my notes.

The speed limit, it took me approximately five minutes and 35 seconds.

The accelerated speeds, it took me approximately four minutes and
three seconds.

Q. Okay.

And did you take a third route?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Can you trace that for the jury.

A. Third route, starting at the same starting point, traveling
eastbound on Dorothy to Bundy, southbound on Bundy to Mayfield,
westbound on Mayfield to Gretna Green, northbound on Gretna Green to
San Vicente, westbound on San Vicente to Cliffwood, here (indicating),
right turn onto Cliffwood, traveling northbound through Sunset,
stopping at Highwood, making a left-hand turn to Rockingham, and then
up to 360 North Rockingham.

Q. And did you take that route both at the speed limit and at the
accelerated speeds?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. How long did each of those take you?

A. The speed limit took me approximately six minutes and nine seconds.
The accelerated speed, four minutes and two seconds.

Q. What time -- what was the time frame that you drove these routes on
Sunday night?

A. I started the assignment at approximately 10 o'clock, and I
finished at around midnight.

MR. GELBLUM: I have no further questions.

THE COURT: Cross.

CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. BAKER:

Q. Pretty quiet out there on Sunday night.

MR. BAKER: Mr. Petee, you may resume the stand.

(Witness complies)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Pretty quiet out there?

A. Yes.

Q. Very few cars?

A. Oh, yes.

Q. Did you see any cars on Gretna Green or Dorothy or Mayfield that
were moving?

A. Yes.

Q. How many on any of the three -- well, any of the six trips that you
had?

A. At a given time?

Q. Yeah. Anything. Just -- did you see one time, period?

A. Three.

Q. Any more than that?

And when you got over to -- up by Brentwood -- Mr. Simpson's house,
did you pick the way to get there, or did somebody tell you what
routes to take?

A. I was told what routes to take.

Q. And were you told that -- well, did you get a Thomas Guide out,
sir, and take a look and see what the quickest way to get to
Rockingham would be from 875 South Bundy in that alleyway?

A. Just to look at it for that specific reason.

Q. Well, strike that. Let me withdraw the question and ask you a
different one.

You were certainly told that time was important, were you not, before
you started this assignment that you were given Sunday?

A. Not directly.

Q. You work for Grailey and Associates, right?

A. That's right.

Q. Grailey and Associates.

You know Mr. Marlow works there?

A. Yes.

Q. And Mr. Marlow is a former LAPD officer who investigated the
Simpson case while he was with the LAPD, right?

MR. PETROCELLI: Beyond the scope, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

There's no relationship with regard to this.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) That's true, is it not?

A. Yes.

Q. Mr. Marlow also investigated the case at the direction and through
the payroll of the plaintiffs' lawyers during this civil case, right?

A. True.

Q. And you knew from Mr. Tippin -- and he worked there, too, former
LAPD, right?

A. That's correct.

Q. And Mr. Tippin investigated the Simpson case when he was an LAPD
officer, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. And he, in fact, reinvestigated the case at the direction and
through the remuneration of the plaintiffs in this case, correct?

A. Initially, yes.

Q. And you were certainly aware when you got this assignment on
Sunday, that time lines -- that is, the amount of time it takes to get
from 875 South Bundy to 360 North Rockingham -- is critical in this
case, correct?

You were told that?

A. I was not told that it was critical.

Q. You understood that it was critical; that is, how much time anybody
-- if it was Mr. Simpson, would have to leave 875 South Bundy and to
get to 360 North Rockingham, true?

A. I wasn't told in that manner.

Q. Well, regardless of the words or what manner you were told, before
you started this exercise of Sunday evening, you knew that time
between 875 South Bundy and 360 North Rockingham was critical to this
case, did you not?

MR. GELBLUM: Asked and answered three times, Your Honor.

MR. BAKER: Well, he won't --

THE COURT: Won't answer it.

MR. GELBLUM: He said no.

THE COURT: I'm going to overrule it.

Well, Mr. Baker is entitled to get an answer.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Can you answer that, sir, please?

A. Yes.

Q. All right. And you -- did you have a Thomas Guide before you
started this exercise that you did this last Sunday with you?

A. Yes.

Q. And did you happen to kind of take a look at the Thomas Guide to
see if -- if it -- if, in fact, you were trying to get from 875 South
Bundy to the Rockingham address, what the quickest route would
possibly be?

A. No.

Q. Well, did you think that by going south on Bundy, that that was the
quickest way to go north, to the 360 North Rockingham place of Mr.
Simpson?

A. There's an arrow at Dorothy and Bundy that indicates you're not to
make a left-hand turn onto Bundy.

Q. Well, maybe you didn't understand the question. Let me see if I can
try it again.

If you -- you started -- as I understand it, sir, there's an alley
that goes between Bundy and Gretna Green that services the house,
including 875 South Bundy, is there not?

A. Yes.

Q. And as I understand your testimony, you were parked in the corner
in the alleyway, true?

A. No.

Q. Where were you parked?

A. At the alleyway on the street.

Q. Oh, you were already on the street?

A. Yes.

Q. So you didn't go behind 875 South Bundy?

A. No.

Q. Okay.

You parked on -- were you told to park on the street?

Somebody tell you don't walk -- park behind the house of 875, park out
on Dorothy and point your vehicle towards the east, or Bundy, as you
commenced this little exercise?

A. That's what I was told.

Q. Who told you that?

A. It came from the law office.

Q. Who told you that?

A. Specifically, I don't know.

Q. So did you get a memorandum as to how the little exercise was going
to be undertaken?

A. I was given -- regarding the routes of travel.

Q. You have that with you?

A. No.

Q. Why not?

A. I --

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. Irrelevant that he doesn't have it.

THE COURT: It's a question. He's asking him why he doesn't have it.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Somebody tell you not to bring it, Mr. Petee?

A. (No verbal response.)

Q. Oh, so when you come back tomorrow, can you bring that with you?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. I don't know he's coming back tomorrow.

MR. BAKER: I think so.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, Mr. Petee, when you were told, then, to park
your vehicle, and you were on the south side of Dorothy, heading east
-- is that correct, sir?

A. Yes.

Q. You were told then to go east on Dorothy and then go south on
Bundy, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And you, of course, knew that your final destination in this time
period that you knew was crucial, was to the north, true?

A. Yes.

Q. And so you certainly knew from reviewing the Thomas Guide, that the
quickest way, if you were going to get from 875 South Bundy, would be
either to turn right on Dorothy and go up Gretna Green and then take
an alternate route up to Ashford and Rockingham, but not to go south,
correct?

A. Can you repeat that again.

Q. Sure.

If you had to get from 875 South Bundy to 360 North Rockingham from
dot A to dot B, you're sure, and you -- and you're under instructions,
given no routes whatsoever, you were requested to get from point A to
point B as quick as you can, you sure wouldn't turn right on Bundy,
would you?

A. No.

Q. In fact, if you were parked in an alley and you had committed some
heinous crime, would you either turn around in the alley and go in --

Well, strike that.

If you were parked in the alley behind 875 South Bundy and wanted to
get to Ashford as quickly as possible, and your car was headed in a
southerly direction, you would either go out the alley to Dorothy,
take an immediate right, take another immediate right, and go north on
Gretna Green, right?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. No foundation.

THE COURT: Objection sustained.

This witness was only asked what his times were and what his routes
were, not asked for an evaluation.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Well, you -- in arriving at the routes, did you have
any input into this, or did this all come with direction from the Law
Offices of Mitchell Silberberg & Knupp?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. Asked and answered.

THE COURT: Overruled. That wasn't asked.

A. The assignment came from the law firm.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You had no discretion as to how you could alter the
vehicle [sic] and get from the lower red dot to the upper red dot,
correct?

THE COURT: Alter the vehicle?

MR. BAKER: I'm sorry; I apologize if I said alter the vehicle.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Alter the route to get from the dot on Bundy to the
dot on Rockingham?

A. No.

Q. Okay.

Now, in arriving -- in looking at it, did you ask anybody why these
particular routes were chosen, as contrasted to some other way to get
from 875 South Bundy to Rockingham?

A. No.

Q. Did you suggest to anyone that, for example, in your route 3, when
you're over here, coming up Cliffwood --

This is Cliffwood right here, isn't it, where my -- (indicating) you
can just see the wood up here, the map is --

A. Yes.

Q. -- a little.

Okay.

Did you suggest to anyone, if you wanted the quickest way to get to --
off San Vicente to Clifford to Rockingham, would be to turn left off
Ashford?

MR. GELBLUM: The witness testified he followed instructions; that's
all he did.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. BAKER: I'm asking him if he asked anyone --

THE COURT: The only testimony on direct, he took the routes, gave the
times. That's it.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, as I understand your testimony, then, knowing
that time was critical, the first -- the first route that you were
ordered to take by the plaintiffs' lawyers, you made in six minutes
and 37 seconds. That's the total lapsed time of the first trip,
correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And then you chopped that by a third.

In other words, you chopped more than two minutes and a half off of
the elapsed time by sticking your foot in it, right?

In other words, when you did the same route on the second trip, you
had, I think, elapsed time of four minutes and six seconds, true?

A. True.

Q. So you took off over two and a half minutes in a
six-and-a-half-minute trip, right?

A. Yes.

Q. And then you put next to it, traveling at accelerated and
reasonable speed -- those are your words, are they not?

A. Yes.

Q. You think it's reasonable to run down San Vicente at 60 miles an
hour?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. Irrelevant. What's relevant?

THE COURT: What's reasonable to him is irrelevant. Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Well, you would agree with me that you weren't
traveling at reasonable speeds, even though that's what you put on
your notes, correct?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. Irrelevant.

THE COURT: Overruled. That's why you put on this witness.

A. That particular roadway will handle freeway speeds.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You think it's okay, it's reasonable to go 60 miles
an hour, right?

A. That's how fast I was able to go.

Q. Okay.

And do you have handwritten notes indicating what the speed was at the
times that you made these passes last Sunday night?

A. No. My notes were drafted into this form right here.

Q. What did you do with the handwritten notes?

A. They're destroyed.

Q. Why?

A. I custom --

Q. Well, you knew you were going to come and sit on this witness
stand, did you not, sir?

You knew that was the whole purpose of the Sunday night exercise,
wasn't it?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, your route to -- you took over a minute and a half off by
traveling at your accelerated speeds, correct?

A. I'm sorry?

Q. Routes 2. You dropped the time over a minute and a half by sticking
your foot in it again, didn't you?

A. Yes.

Q. And did you get up to over 60 on San Vicente on that trip?

A. I don't believe so.

Q. Did -- on route 3, when you dropped two minutes again, a third of
the time off of that, did you go over 60 on San Vicente at this point
in time?

A. I don't believe I went over 60.

Q. Now, you were told in your directions, I take it, sir, that you
were to rush, correct, on the second trip?

A. I was not told to rush.

Q. You were told to get the elapsed time between 875 South Bundy,
after you turned and went south on Bundy, as low as you could. True?

A. As fast as I could.

Q. As fast as you could, right?

A. Within -- within reason.

Q. As fast as you could, because you knew the time was critical and
crucial, true?

A. True.

MR. BAKER: I would ask that the witness be requested to return
tomorrow with the -- with the memorandum.

MR. GELBLUM: I object. There's no reason.

MR. PETROCELLI: I would ask Mr. Baker put his foot to it and try to
finish the witness up.

MR. BAKER: I want to see the memorandum and the order that was given
to this witness by these lawyers.

MR. GELBLUM: He has no right to see that, Your Honor. This witness is
a five minute witness that's been strung out by Mr. Baker for 20
minutes here.

THE COURT: Well, I think he's entitled to see what directions -- the
directions were. Overruled.

And the witness is ordered to produce the document, be here tomorrow
at 8:30.

Ladies and gentlemen, you're excused until 8:30.

Don't form or express any opinions. Don't conduct any experiments on
your own.

(At 4:30 P.M., an adjournment was taken until Thursday, December 5,
1996, at 8:30 A.M.)

REPORTER'S DAILY TRANSCRIPT
DECEMBER 3, 1996

SUPERIOR COURT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA
FOR THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES

SHARON RUFO, ET AL., N/A, PLAINTIFFS,

VS.

ORENTHAL JAMES SIMPSON, ET AL., DEFENDANTS.


SANTA MONICA, CALIFORNIA
TUESDAY, DECEMBER 3, 1996
9:00 A.M.

DEPARTMENT NO. WEQ
HON. HIROSHI FUJISAKI, JUDGE

(REGINA D. CHAVEZ, OFFICIAL REPORTER)

(The following proceedings were held in the Court's chambers, outside
the presence of the jury.)

THE COURT: Okay. Now that I have you in chambers, my turn to surprise
you.

I'm going to be giving special instructions to the jury regarding Mr.
Simpson's examination by Mr. Petrocelli. I've written it out; I'm
going to pass it out to you. Look it over before I come out or before
we have the jury come out. If you want to make a record, we'll do that
before I make any statements to the jurors.

(Court hands document to counsel.)

THE COURT REPORTER: Are we still on the record?

THE COURT: My suggestion is, you guys go out and study it.

(The following proceedings were held in open court, outside the
presence of the jury.)

THE COURT: Okay.

The Court, in chambers, gave counsel the special instruction that the
Court intends to give to the jury with regards to examination of Mr.
Simpson last week.

And at this time, if you have any comments for the record, you may
make them.

MR. PETROCELLI: Thank you, Your Honor.

I just read the Court's proposed instruction. As I understand it, it
basically points out to the jury that Mr. Baker, in his opening
statement, spoke on the subject of the lie-detector test and thereby
opened up the subject to examination by the plaintiff.

The Court then goes on to say that, however, by Mr. Baker opening the
door, he didn't permit me to inquire into confidential communications.

None of my questions, Your Honor, inquired into confidential
communications in regard to this subject matter. That's point 1.

Point number 2: In the Court's proposed instruction to the jury, it
operates under the assumption that I asked questions of Mr. Simpson
about Mr. Schiller's book and literally referenced Mr. Schiller's
book.

At no time did I do so.

I specifically avoided mentioning Mr. Schiller's book at all in my
questions because I didn't want to get into the thorny issues of
privilege.

I've just had an occasion to review the transcript of my examination
of Mr. Simpson on this subject, and there is absolutely no mention, as
far as I can see, to Mr. Schiller or his book.

And so I would object to the text of this being mentioned to the jury
because you're pointing out things that are actually not accurate. I
at no time referenced the Schiller book. The jury shouldn't be told
that I did so.

THE COURT: Well, Mr. Petrocelli, if you recall from your examination
of the transcript, that you made pointed reference to the book at side
bench, so I think there was a reasonable inference that that's what
you were referring to.

MR. PETROCELLI: But the jury doesn't have any knowledge about the
Schiller book, and the side-bar conferences were out of the presence
of the jury. And I didn't bring up the Schiller book. I mean, that was
a point that Mr. Baker kept bringing up in regard to the privilege
issue.

And the issue -- point I want to make, Your Honor, is that this issue
of the lie-detector test, first of all, this was brought up initially
by Mr. Baker, who made a very strong point in his opening statement,
that Mr. Simpson was absolutely willing to take one and the police
refused. And the only inference to be drawn therefrom, and the only
reason why he made such a statement, is to suggest that Mr. Simpson
was innocent; if he took a lie-detector test, he would have passed it.
There is no other reason to make such an argument to the jury.

THE COURT: You made no objection at that time, if you recall.

MR. PETROCELLI: The statement is out.

THE COURT: You could have made an objection.

MR. PETROCELLI: And secondly --

THE COURT: You didn't make an objection, so I assume you had something
in mind when you failed to make your objection.

MR. PETROCELLI: Mr. Baker opened the door and fully intended to follow
up on it.

And the second thing, Your Honor, is that -- I think if you go back
and look the at transcript, I didn't launch into this line of
examination. Mr. Simpson brought out the issue of the lie-detector
test, once again, or his willingness to take one. And I then followed
up on it. In other words, I believe if you'll look at the transcript,
that he volunteered it again on his own, not in response to a question
of mine, but just added something about wanting to take a lie-detector
test.

And then I followed up on it, now having been -- it having been
referred to twice by the defense: Once by Mr. Simpson and once by Mr.
Baker.

I did not initiate any of this dialogue about a lie-detector test.

Having said all that, I believe that if Your Honor wants to give some
kind of instruction, it has to be more balanced and more even-handed.
I don't believe this accomplishes that.

And I also believe that this is highly inaccurate because it says that
I referred to a book written by Mr. Schiller, and I at no time did so.
And you have a big, long paragraph here about my talking about the
Schiller book. And I don't think it's appropriate to be telling the
jury anything at all about the Schiller book, in particular that I
referred to the Schiller book, Your Honor, because I did not do so.
And I was steadfast in avoiding the subject altogether.

So I would ask that this be modified. I would propose drafting
something if Your Honor would like, but this, I don't believe, is
appropriate.

MR. BAKER: Your Honor --

THE COURT: Yes?

MR. BAKER: Two things. One, in my opening statement I didn't refer to
him taking a lie-detector test; I referred to the offer to take a
lie-detector test. And there is, in a total of six hours of opening
statement, two sentences, as I went back and looked at it, because we
had prepared a motion that we were going to file with the Court this
afternoon on this very issue, requesting a mistrial because of the
introduction of the evidence of the lie detector -- the polygraph
information.

As the Court will recall, we made -- Mr. Blasier made a motion
relative to the Schiller book before Mr. Simpson took the stand, and
the Court overruled that motion. The Schiller book was sitting right
on counsel table with Post-Its, in front of Mr. Petrocelli during his
examination of Mr. Simpson.

I had asked on two occasions that that book be removed from counsel
table. The plaintiffs' attorneys would not and did not do it.

They certainly referred to it.

I went back yesterday -- I looked at the -- the piece in the book
relative to the polygraph examination that is mentioned in the book
and -- and that indicates that that examination, which was never an
examination, was done on the 14th, when Mr. Simpson admitted that he
was hooked up to it, but the test was never completed.

Mr. Petrocelli, in an effort to mislead this jury, kept talking about
the 15th in the transcript because he wanted to mislead the jury,
because on the 15th was the letter written to Vannatter and Lange,
indicating that Mr. Simpson would take a polygraph test.

But we made that motion and I don't think that any jury instruction is
curative of the evidence that has gone before the jury.

In fact, I'll have the motion here momentarily. We were waiting, Your
Honor, to file that motion because Schiller, on November 25, on MSNBC,
in an interview, indicated that he didn't know what the content of
this purported hook-up was, whether there were any questions asked
about the murders. All he apparently reported was that there was a
test score; that he doesn't know whether it was a completed test or
anything.

I wanted to include that.

But in any event, there are California cases which I will have
momentarily and cite to the Court, where after a curative instruction
such as the Court proposes, was given to a jury. And after a jury
verdict was returned, on appeal -- the Court of Appeals reversed,
saying you cannot -- a curative instruction simply does not work.

And so I would suggest that the Court mistry this case and,
unfortunately, start all over again.

We did not discuss taking of a lie-detector test, which I would
suggest to the Court, is far different than what Mr. Petrocelli put
before the jury. He got them to assume that a test was taken, it was
completed, that the score was minus 22. That was extremely deceptive.

If the Court will review -- I believe it's Evidence Code Section
351.1, the Court will see that before any of that evidence can get to
the jury, there has to be a stipulation. There was never a stipulation
by this side; and therefore, I think it is imperative and obligatory
that the Court mistries this case, and this case be sent down for
trial again, at some subsequent date.

And that is because, even after we were at the side bar, we had an
unlimited discussion relative to this issue. The Court overruled my
objection. Mr. Petrocelli went right into it, went right into the fact
that -- that there was a polygraph test taken, went right into the --
this purported score.

There's only one place that I've ever read that, and that's in the
Schiller book.

MR. PETROCELLI: First of all, Your Honor, I haven't gotten any motion
for a mistrial yet, so it's premature to argue that.

I will point out that Section 351.1 applies specifically and only to
criminal proceedings, not civil proceedings.

THE COURT: Well, I'm not inclined to do anything other than to
instruct the jury relative to your examination of Mr. Simpson.

And I'll take a few moments to review my instruction and make any
alterations I feel that are necessary. And I'll have the jury come
out, and I'm going to give the instruction, and then we'll proceed
with the trial.

MR. PETROCELLI: The pertinent questions are Section 191 of the -- Page
191 of the transcript, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Okay.

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, I will give the Court cases citing the 351.1
application to civil cases within -- shortly.

THE COURT: Mr. Baker, you know, I've come this far, and if it's your
opinion that a curative instruction will not do, then that's your
opinion.

MR. BAKER: I understand.

THE COURT: I'm doing what I have to do.

MR. BAKER: I understand that, sir.

Let me say, you said I spoke on the subject of a lie-detector test.
There are two sentences in six hours. So I don't think I spoke on the
subject. I mentioned the offer to take a lie-detector test.

THE COURT: Mr. Baker, you slipped that in, and Mr. Petrocelli took
advantage of it.

MR. BAKER: Well, I mean, you can have your opinion, Judge, and --

THE COURT: That is my opinion.

MR. BAKER: Obviously, the Court of Appeals will have the last word.

THE COURT: All right.

MR. KELLY: Your Honor, I had one other matter before the jury came in,
before witnesses --

THE COURT: Well . . .

MR. KELLY: Okay.

(Recess.)

(The following proceedings were held in open court, outside the
presence of the jury.)

MR. PETROCELLI: Thank you, Your Honor.

I have reviewed the revised instruction proposed by the Court. I have
a couple of comments for the record.

First of all, on the second page, at the top of the page, the first
sentence says that there is no other evidence before you that Mr.
Simpson took the lie-detector test and so forth. I have no quarrel
with that statement.

I do quarrel with the statement two paragraphs down, where the Court
says there is no evidence before you that Mr. Simpson took a
lie-detector test, because there is evidence that Mr. Simpson gave, in
the form of his answers, that he was hooked up to a test, and the jury
can draw their own conclusion about what that meant. They don't have
to accept Mr. Simpson's characterization; they can accept his exact
factual rendition and conclude that he did take the test.

So I think that -- that is not accurate and it is inconsistent with
the first statement made by the Court.

And secondly, the Court has only directed that the jury disregard my
questions concerning the lie-detector test, but does not likewise ask
the jury to disregard Mr. Baker's statements about the lie-detector
test. And I think that it should be mutual in that regard.

THE COURT: Well --

MR. BAKER: Your Honor --

THE COURT: -- you had your opportunity to object to that statement at
the time the opening statement was made, so that's gone.

MR. BAKER: I won't belabor that issue.

I would request again, without waiver of -- of our view that curative
instructions are not adequate based upon People versus Aragon,
A-R-A-G-O-N, 1957, 154 Cal.Ap.2d 646, People versus Schiers,
S-C-H-I-E-R-S, 1970, 19 Cal.Ap.3d 102, and People versus Bentley 1955,
131 Cal.Ap.3d -- or 2d. Pardon me. 131 Cal.Ap.2d 687.

And I would request that -- the jury hasn't heard about
attorney-client communications. Second paragraph of your proposed
special instructions indicates something about attorney-client
communications. And I think that -- that to raise that in a -- in an
instruction that's meant to be curative, raises the issue that the
information that Mr. Petrocelli gave the jury, through his questions
to Mr. Simpson, came through attorney-client communications.

And that raises the sphere, at least in my mind, that that -- that the
jury will believe that came through communications from
attorney-client. And I think that just red-flags the issue, and would
request that the second full paragraph be deleted. And other than
that, without waiving the objections that we have, have no further
objections to the Court's proposed special instruction.

THE COURT: Well, the Court put that in there because that seemed to
have been one of the major points that you raised at the side-bench
argument on that issue. So I -- out of an abundance of caution, the
Court is going to give it.

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, we also raised the issue of the book. If we're
going to put anything about communications, then -- I mean, you've
deleted that.

Because it was raised at side bar, I'd respectfully request that the
communications concerning attorney-client -- because I certainly did
raise it, but I raised it at side bar out of the presence of the jury
for the particular reason that you did not want the jury to infer that
these communications came from his attorney, either now or at the
criminal case.

And I think that we would be pleased to present the Court with the
transcript of Mr. Schiller on MSNBC, which we will have momentarily,
that indicates he doesn't know what was in this purported hook-up on
June 14. Now he doesn't know if any questions were asked relative to
the murders at all.

And so we're heightening this to a level that I think is
inappropriate, in view of what we're trying to do is offer a curative
instruction, I would submit.

MR. PETROCELLI: We object to any reference to the Schiller book, as it
was not part of any of my questions.

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, I apologize. The plaintiffs didn't object to
taking communications between attorney client out, I did.

THE COURT: I'm going to leave it in, for the -- there was reference in
Mr. Petrocelli's examination about attorneys from San Francisco and
Mr. Simpson -- some arrangement being made with Mr. Gelblum, I
believe, in regards to the "demonstration," as Mr. Simpson put it.

So I'm going to leave it out, out of an abundance of caution.

Bring the jury in.

MR. GELBLUM: Your Honor, we have a couple things.

We had subpoenaed a document, and the attorney for the organization
which it is from, which it was subpoenaed, is here. She was under an
order from probably a year ago now, from Judge Ito, not to disclose
it.

Judge Ito said as long as you tell her to turn it over, he doesn't
care; she can turn it over; but she wants to hear it from you, that
she can turn it over.

MS. WITHEY: Pamela Withey appearing for the witness that was
subpoenaed today, the Ocean Park Community Center, for certain
documents. They were also subpoenaed in the criminal trial. And during
the course of that trial, a motion to quash was made and heard. At the
conclusion of that, Judge Ito issued an order to me personally,
stating -- since I was an officer of the Court, he could have control
over that -- that I maintain the original of the documents and not
allow them to be copied for any purpose at any time.

He also allowed one copy to be made for the prosecution, one for the
defense, and ordered them also not to disseminate them to anyone, and
so we have not.

We've now received the subpoena to produce a document here today. We
have the documents. I would like to be relieved, of course, of the
Court's order from Judge Ito.

In order to do so, I contacted Judge Ito's clerk, Yolanda, who
indicated to me that basically, a motion may need to be made, but my
discussion with counsel here this morning was that she indicated that
Judge Ito would do whatever you felt was appropriate, since it is now
within your jurisdiction.

THE COURT: Well, I don't have any motion before me. I don't even know
what the document is.

MR. GELBLUM: We just subpoenaed it, Your Honor. It's a subpoena for
some documents from a battered women's shelter, Sojourn House. We have
a witness that we intend to call today who will be testifying about
that document.

We have not ever had a chance to see the document. Yesterday, I spoke
with Yolanda, Judge Ito's clerk, who was on the phone, and spoke to
Judge Ito, and came back, he said, as long as Judge Fujisaki says it's
okay to turn over the documents, it's okay with him; that was his case
and this is your case now, and he doesn't feel -- it's your decision.

MR. P. BAKER: This is the first we've heard of the subpoena and the
witness he's referring to, Nancy Ney, is subject to a motion to strike
witnesses, which was filed this morning. Nancy Ney is a witness who
says she received a phone call from a person named Nicole -- she
doesn't know who -- if it's Nicole Brown Simpson, totally hearsay, and
we object to the introduction of this document of her testimony as a
result, and Nancy Ney's not a witness.

THE COURT: What's the document?

MS. WITHEY: These documents were documents in the possession of the
Ocean Park Community Service Center and the witness here the custodian
is Vivian Rothstein, who is the director of that program.

The documents are call sheets filled out by a counselor working for
the Community Service Center, a calendar and some additional notes
filled out by the counselor with regard to a call that was made into
the shelter.

The motion to quash was subject to Evidence Code 1035, which had
nothing to do with the civil matter; it had to do with admissibility
of call sheets in a criminal case. But during that hearing, Judge Ito
did find that the documents -- made a threshold finding of elements of
the documents, after having reviewed the documents.

The evidentiary issues are another matter. All I'm here to say is that
I'd be delighted to turn them over, but I just need to be relieved of
the court order; that's all.

THE COURT: Okay. It's within my power. You're relieved.

MS. WITHEY: Thank you, Your Honor.

MR. P. BAKER: I would like to put on the record that Judge Ito quashed
the subpoena.

THE COURT: I don't have any -- there's no standing on that issue at
all.

Anything else?

MR. KELLY: Yes, Judge.

Judge, with regard to two issues regarding witnesses on our witness
list. One witness, Alfredo Acosta, who's under subpoena and was listed
to appear today, he's in El Paso, Texas; his father is very ill, and
he's not expected back for several days. And he's expressed a
willingness to testify and will appear when he's able to get back from
caring for his father in El Paso.

The second one is Robert Kardashian, who is not subpoenaed, but I had
dealt with Janet Levine, his attorney, and had spoken to her last
Wednesday and last Friday, and she had indicated there was no reason
at that time to serve Mr. Kardashian, and that he was out of town; he
would be back last Saturday or Sunday. And she discussed with him his
appearance. We talked about his appearing Wednesday morning to
testify, the scope of his examination, and whether or not she was
going to appear with him.

And she never -- she indicated to me there was no reason to serve him
at that time.

I expressed a willingness to do so. She asked to hold off as a
courtesy.

It was only yesterday, at 2:30 in the afternoon, that she left a
message in my New York office that he would not appear without a
subpoena, and that she would not accept a subpoena on his behalf. And
he is still on the east coast at this time.

And what I would ask for, Your Honor, based on her prior
representation, that with regard to Mr. Acosta and Mr. Kardashian,
that when they become available, that we be allowed to reopen our case
if we've rested, at the time when they do become available, just for
the limited purpose of calling them. And we expect it to be short and
limited testimony.

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, obviously, in view of the way that the
plaintiffs have put on their case, I would object to that. I mean,
when we had Detective Vannatter on the witness stand, or Detective
Lange, they wouldn't let us go into anything that was outside the
scope of what they felt were the parameters of their case.

And I certainly am not going to, at least without objection, agree
that they can interrupt our case to put their witnesses on.

He had the right to subpoena Kardashian and he had the right to
subpoena and get Mr. Acosta in here.

THE COURT: Well, Mr. Acosta, I think, has a reasonable excuse. So I
will permit Mr. Acosta to be called out of order.

Mr. Kardashian - if you wanted him, you should have subpoenaed him.

MR. P. BAKER: Can we have Mr. Acosta testify following the
presentation of our case?

THE COURT: Whenever he's available.

MR. P. BAKER: Can we find out beforehand if he's available come
January?

MR. KELLY: Yes. I'll find that out.

With regard to Mr. Kardashian, we relied on representations of
counsel.

THE COURT: Maybe you shouldn't have.

MR. KELLY: Obviously, not at this point. Seemed like it would be a
good cause.

THE COURT: Doesn't sound like a good cause to me.

THE BAILIFF: The jury is right here.

MR. BAKER: We have another issue, on the issue of Mr. Wayne Hughes.

Mr. Wayne Hughes is apparently their first witness. Mr. Hughes, I
think, at least in his statement to the District Attorney, indicated
there was an incident that he may be asked about this morning, and
that was an incident that occurred, he now has recollection, in 1979
and 1980, when Nicole Brown Simpson came to his house, saying that Mr.
Simpson may have had physical contact with her.

Mr. Hughes never discussed this matter with Mr. Simpson and will so
testify. He has no knowledge of whether Nicole Brown Simpson's
representations to him were accurate. He asked Nicole Brown Simpson --
at least he'd be prepared to testify that if she wanted him to ever
discuss this with O.J. Simpson, she said no.

And based upon the hearsay nature of it, the remote nature of '79 or
'80, we move to exclude any reference to -- to incident number one, if
you will.

And then he discussed the 1989 incident, and he's prepared to testify.
And we have no objection, obviously, of him testifying about that.

MR. PETROCELLI: Your Honor, under People versus Zack and People versus
Linkenauer, the relationship -- the relationship between the defendant
and the victim is relevant to the issue of motive and identity. And
the Court specifically pointed out that acts of physical violence in
that relationship are particularly relevant, in addition to evidence
of quarrels and antagonism or enmity.

Now, in addition to that, Your Honor, which Mr. Hughes will testify
about, Mr. Simpson categorically denied ever hitting Nicole. And this
evidence is offered to directly impeach that testimony.

Moreover, Mr. Baker, in his opening statement, described for about the
first hour or so, the nature of the relationship between Nicole Brown
Simpson and Mr. Simpson, and specifically represented to the jury that
there was only one physical altercation in 1989.

And we will be producing a series of witnesses, each lasting about
five to ten minutes, to evidence that there were other acts of
violence in the relationship.

MR. P. BAKER: Judge, regarding the remoteness, People versus Zack does
not say that. People versus Zack is a murder case where the decedents
died in 1982 and the issue was the stormy -- and the Court said it --
the stormy up and down relationship from 1978 to 1980. That's four
years.

This issue is 16 years, and we believe the Court should be directed to
People versus Gonzales, where it held the victim's representation to
violence seven years before the crime was held too remote for
evidentiary value.

Thirdly, Judge Ito already rendered a ruling on this, and I submitted
it as Exhibit A to my motion, and Judge Ito found that it was too
remote, and he said "this event provides only indirect evidence of
assaultive conduct. The probative value of this incident is,
therefore, much diminished when compared with the Court's time that
would be -- would be required in the presentation. It's been
collaterally estopped. It's too removed. We think People versus
Gonzales binds the Court --

THE COURT: How is it collaterally estopped?

MR. P. BAKER: Judge Ito rendered a ruling when it was remote in time
in relation to the crimes of June 12, 1994.

THE COURT: I don't think the concept of collateral estoppel applies
here.

MR. P. BAKER: The same issues reliance -- they've relied on collateral
estoppel throughout the case, we relied on Judge Ito's ruling, holding
O.J. Simpson over for their motion for punitive damages. This opinion
was rendered. It was decided it was held too remote. It's
characterized by hearsay.

THE COURT: Well, I think the doctrine of collateral estoppel would
apply to Mr. Simpson, but would not apply to Mr. Goldman.

MR. P. BAKER: The issues were the same.

THE COURT: Parties.

MR. BAKER: You still --

THE COURT: Am I getting two timed?

MR. BAKER: Yes absolutely. You still have to put the evidence on by
competent evidence. You -- that's what we're talking about here is the
hearsay.

THE COURT: Well, it's not collateral estoppel, so that's out.

You want to address the hearsay issue?

MR. PETROCELLI: Yes, Your Honor.

First of all, unlike the criminal case, the defense in this case has
proffered Nicole's state of mind as -- and as was ruled on the 16th of
September in connection with the motions in limine, Nicole's state of
mind is directly relevant to the issue of the relationship between Mr.
Simpson and Nicole.

So, number one, her state of mind furnishes an exception to get in
this testimony.

And secondly, in this particular case, as Mr. Hughes will testify, Mr.
-- Nicole came running to his house after being hit by Mr. Simpson,
was extremely upset, and it would qualify, certainly, as a spontaneous
statement. She also showed Mr. Hughes the mark on her body where Mr.
Simpson had hit her.

And again, I emphasize that in opening statement, Mr. Baker's spent
quite a bit of time characterizing this relationship between the two
and pointing out that there wasn't any violence or physical
alterations, except on one occasion. And Mr. Simpson, at no time in
his testimony, limited his answers. He said "never," categorically,
did he ever touch Nicole, slap her, strike her, hit her, and so forth.

MR. BAKER: In 1979 -- first of all, the -- my remarks in opening
statement were in response to the plaintiffs' remarks. They proffered
her state of mind, not us.

Number two is the -- the hearsay statements are -- are definitely not
spontaneous declarations. You're not going to hear that Mr. Wayne
Hughes lives next door to O.J. Simpson.

Number three, they're so remote in the time as to be irrelevant and
immaterial to any issue in this case. They're talking about 15, 16
years prior to the murders that they are attempting, in this case, to
hold Mr. Simpson responsible for.

THE COURT: Okay. I'll permit Mr. Hughes to testify to the '89
incident, but not the '79 incidents.

MR. PETROCELLI: Your Honor --

THE COURT: Let's get on with the trial.

MR. PETROCELLI: Well, Your Honor, I object to this. I -- just because
he makes this argument -- I mean, Mr. Simpson categorically testified
that he never once hit Nicole and --

THE COURT: Mr. Petrocelli, I've heard your argument. I've made my
ruling.

Okay.

THE BAILIFF: Jury walking in.

MR. PETROCELLI: Well, I'm not going to call Mr. Hughes.

THE COURT: All right; don't call him.

MR. PETROCELLI: What's the ground, Your Honor, remoteness?

THE COURT: That's right. 352.

(The jurors resumed their respective seats.)

THE COURT: Morning, ladies and gentlemen.

JUROR: Morning, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Ladies and gentlemen, the Court at this time will give you
specific instructions regarding the plaintiffs' examination of Mr.
Simpson which was just completed concerning lie detectors.

I want you to listen very closely.

All communications between an attorney and his client are absolutely
privileged.

This means that such communications cannot be used by anyone for any
purpose except with the permission of the client.

Mr. Simpson cannot be asked any questions about any communications
with his attorneys. Furthermore, there is no evidence that Mr. Simpson
consented to the publication of any of his communications with his
attorney.

You will recall, Mr. Simpson's attorney, Mr. Baker, in his opening
statement to you, spoke on the subject of a lie-detector test. By this
opening statement, Mr. Simpson opened the subject of lie detectors to
examination by the plaintiff. This, however, did not open the subject
of any communication on this matter between Mr. Simpson and his
attorneys, or persons acting for the attorneys for any purpose.

In this trial, Mr. Petrocelli questioned Mr. Simpson whether he took a
lie-detector test, any score and meaning thereof. I instruct you that
his questions do not and cannot establish that Mr. Simpson took a die
lie-detector test, a score and meaning thereof. Statements of counsel,
that is, the statements or questions of Mr. Petrocelli, are not
evidence and may not be considered by you for any purpose. The
references or statements regarding a lie-detector test and Mr.
Petrocelli's questions are not evidence unless they were adopted by
Mr. Simpson in his answers. A question by itself is not evidence. You
may consider questions only to the extent the content of the questions
are adopted by the answer. Mr. Simpson's answer to the question of
whether he took a lie-detector test was that he was given an
explanation of how the test worked and that he did not take the test.

There is no other evidence before you that Mr. Simpson took a
lie-detector test, and the plaintiff is bound by Mr. Simpson's
response.

Likewise, when Mr. Petrocelli asked Mr. Simpson whether he knew what
the score on the test was, whether it was a minus 22, or whether it
indicated extreme deception, these were questions by an attorney and
do not constitute evidence. Mr. Simpson denied any test score or any
knowledge of what test scores meant, and there is no evidence before
you of any test score or what a score means. There was only Mr.
Petrocelli's questions which were not adopted by an answer. Plaintiff
is bound by Mr. Simpson's response.

Therefore, there is no evidence before you that Mr. Simpson took a
lie-detector test, no evidence about any score on such a test, nor any
evidence of what any score means. You must totally disregard the
questions about taking lie-detector tests, test scores and their
meanings, and treat the subject as though you had never heard of it.

Do all of the jurors understand these instructions?

JURORS: Yes.

THE COURT: Do any of the jurors have any questions about these
instructions?

JURORS: (Nod negatively.)

THE COURT: Okay. Thank you.

Plaintiffs may call their next witness.

MR. KELLY: India Allen, please.

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, we want to approach.

THE COURT: Okay.

(The following proceedings were held at the bench, with the reporter.)

MR. BAKER: This, well, allegedly is going to comment about a 1980
incident where she observed Mr. Simpson make contact with -- with
Nicole. And we would object on the issue --

THE COURT: You mean physical contact?

MR. BAKER: We -- yes physical. On the issue of remoteness.

THE COURT: Overruled.

(The following proceedings were held in open court, in the presence of
the jury.)

INDIA ALLEN, called as a witness on behalf of Plaintiffs, was duly
sworn and testified as follows:

THE CLERK: You do solemnly swear that the testimony you may give in
the cause now pending before this Court shall be the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

THE WITNESS: I do.

THE CLERK: And if you would, please state and spell your name for the
record,

THE WITNESS: Okay. My name is India Allen, spelled I-N-D-I-A. My last
name is A-L-L-E-N.

DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. KELLY:

Q. Morning, Ms. Allen.

A. Morning.

Q. You're married; is that correct?

A. Yes, I am. I think my husband is in here. He's an officer in the
Marine Corps.

Q. And your married name is?

A. India Rose.

Q. Okay.

And is it my understanding that you use the name India Allen for
professional purposes; is that correct?

A. Yes. I used to be a model; I'm retired now.

Q. Okay.

And you use the name India Allen?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Now, by the way, do you have any children?

A. Yes, I do. I have two, and I have one on the way.

Q. You're expecting?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, taking you back a little bit, about -- did you ever work in a
veterinary hospital?

A. Yes, I did. I worked for Dr. Shipp in Beverly Hills.

Q. And when you say veterinary hospital, this is where you took care
of animals, cats, dogs, et cetera?

A. Yes; they were a full service. They did flea baths, they did
surgery, everything, shots, everything.

Q. And do you recall the location of this veterinary hospital that you
worked at?

A. Yes. It was -- I think it was 351 Foothill Drive, I think,
something like that.

Q. Okay. That's Beverly Hills?

A. Yes, Beverly Hills.

Q. Do you recall approximately what year you worked at this hospital?

A. It was in the early '80s. I think it was '83.

Q. Okay.

And what exactly did you do there when you worked there?

A. I washed dogs and cleaned up after them, and cleaned the kennels,
and all that glamorous stuff.

Q. And how old --

A. That's what I did.

Q. How old were you at this time?

A. I think I was about 20. I think I went through a birthday there, so
I'm not really sure at this time.

Q. How long did you work there for?

A. Not very long. I think about six months, something like that.

Q. Okay.

Now, during the time you worked there, did you ever have occasion to
meet Nicole Brown during your employment there at the hospital?

A. Yes, I did. I don't know if you'd call it meet. She didn't pay that
much attention to me. I washed her dogs.

Q. Okay.

A. Yeah.

MR. KELLY: Can I see 2194.

(Exhibit 2194 displayed.)

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) Do you recognize the individual on the screen there?

A. Yes, I do.

Q. Is that Nicole Brown?

A. Yes, it is.

Q. Okay.

And can you tell the ladies and gentlemen of the jury, under what
circumstances you first dealt with Ms. Brown while working at the
hospital there?

A. Well, the first -- I saw her a couple of times. She came in with
her two Chows to get them washed. I usually did the washing 'cause
they -- they kind of had little tempers on them, so I usually did it.
And so I saw her a couple of times, and -- and then one day she came
in, she was wearing actually a very similar head band to that one she
always wore, and she --

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) If I could interrupt you.

Did there ever come a time that you observed Mr. Simpson at this
animal hospital also?

A. Yes. Only I only saw Mr. Simpson once.

Q. Was that after you had met or dealt with Nicole Brown a couple
times there?

A. Yes, yes, it was.

Q. Okay.

And could you tell me what, if anything, you observed the time that
Nicole Brown was there at the hospital and Mr. Simpson arrived there
also?

A. Well, she came in to pick up her dogs -- and she always wore
sunglasses, she always came in sunglasses and the head band, and
always very glamorous. She was wearing -- I think she was wearing a
gold Spandex exercise outfit. She was wearing a full-length fur coat
over it. I think it was a silver fur but I'm not positive, I'm not
that well versed in furs. And she came in to pick up her Chows and --

MR. BAKER: I'm going to move to strike as nonresponsive.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) You can go ahead.

A. Okay.

She came in to pick them up, and I brought -- I always brought them
out to the car for her. And another guy was with me. I carried out a
bag of dog food and put it in her trunk, and I had the dog, and she
opened the car door, and when she opened the car door, Mr. Simpson
pulled into the parking lot and sort of parked sideways, he didn't
actually pull into a spot, he was kind of parking sideways.

This was on the side of the building. We came out the side door.

And he was very angry. When he got out of the car, he came kind of
around the car very quickly and started yelling at her about wearing
the coat out during the day. And he was very upset; he told her that
he -- I don't know if I can say this or not, out loud.

MR. BAKER: I'm going to object on hearsay grounds in any event, Your
Honor.

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) This is referring to a statement of Mr. Simpson?

A. Yes, it is.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) Okay.

You can tell us what you heard Mr. Simpson state at this time.

A. He said, I didn't buy this fur coat for you to go fuck somebody
else, is what he said. And then he said -- then he said, I want the
coat back, and he grabbed her by the back of the coat and started
trying to pull the coat off of her.

And she said she was -- at the time they were kind of going around and
around about the coat, she was saying she wasn't going to give the
coat back, it was her god damn coat; and so, anyway, she jerked away
from him, and that's when I saw him strike her. He hit her across the
face, and her glasses and her head band flew off and her hair kind of
flew to the side when she came back up.

It was the only time I ever saw her without her sunglasses.

She had sort of a fading bruise under her eye.

Q. And in addition to that fading bruise under her eye, did you see
any other marks on her face at this time?

A. Just her face was red where he hit her.

Q. Okay.

And what if -- let me ask you a couple questions.

First of all, do you remember what kind of car Nicole Brown had at the
time when you were putting the dogs in it?

A. I know it was a Mercedes. I think it was a white Mercedes, but I
always get the white of her Mercedes and her gold pants mixed up, so
it could have been one or the other. It might have been white pants
and gold Mercedes.

Q. Was it a large Mercedes, small one; do you remember what type it
was?

A. No, it was small, I think it was a 450SL.

It was very nice, nice car.

Q. You also indicated that Mr. Simpson was angry when he exited his
car.

A. Yes.

Q. Would you describe exactly what you observed about Mr. Simpson when
he exited his car?

MR. BAKER: Asked and answered, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. Well, he got out of the car, and he was mad. I mean he looked like
he was gritting his teeth, and his fists were clenched, and it was --
it was kind of intimidating. I stayed where I was. It was enough to
keep me where I was with the dogs, and they were a little agitated, so
it was difficult to hold onto them.

Q. And how did you feel when you observed Mr. Simpson first come out
of the car?

MR. BAKER: Objection, relevance.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. Well, I was a little -- first I was shocked because they were two
famous, beautiful people and what I thought getting ready to have a
knock-down, drag-out right in front of me, so -- while I was holding
these dogs. So I was -- I was -- I was shocked and a little intimated
standing there.

Q. Now, what, if anything, happened after Nicole was hit and her
sunglasses and head band came off?

A. She kind of held the coat close to her, didn't look like she was
going to give up the coat, and she picked up her sunglasses, and she
picked up her head band, and she stomped over to the car, and she
said, I'm going home.

And she took the dogs from me; she put the dogs in the car.

And he said, I'll talk to you about this when we get home.

Then she got kind of intimidated and said, fine, I'll talk to you
about it when we get home.

And she got in the car and jerked out of the parking lot first, and
then he got in his car and he followed her.

MR. KELLY: Steve, can I see the picture, please. (Photo displayed.)

MR. KELLY: I'm going to show you one other picture up on the board,
please.

THE COURT REPORTER: Do we have an exhibit number, please.

MR. FOSTER: Next in order.

MR. KELLY: Next in order, Erin.

THE CLERK: 2222.

(The instrument herein described as a photo of O.J. Simpson and Nicole
Brown Simpson in fur coat was marked for identification as Plaintiffs'
Exhibit No. 2222.)

Q. First of all, do you recognize the person wearing the long fur coat
in that picture there?

A. Yes, that's -- that's Nicole. I'm not used to seeing her hair that
way, but yes.

Q. The individual next to her?

A. Looks like Mr. Simpson.

Q. And by the way, do you recognize the coat?

A. Yes, that looks like the coat, yes.

Q. That she was wearing that day in the parking lot?

A. Um-hum.

Q. And one other thing. Prior to Mr. Simpson pulling in the parking
lot that day, were you familiar with who he was before then?

A. Only from television, only from commercials, yeah. I had never
actually seen him in person before. Only from TV. But I recognized him
immediately.

And the car was -- was pretty fancy. I think it was a -- I think it
was a big, blue Rolls Royce.

Q. And is this the first time you've ever testified regarding what you
witnessed that day?

A. Yes, it is.

MR. KELLY: Okay.

I have no further questions.

THE COURT: Cross.

CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. BAKER:

Q. Good morning.

A. Good morning.

Q. Do you have an agent?

A. Do I have an agent?

Q. Yes.

A. No, I don't.

Q. Did you have an agent?

A. Yes, I used to.

Q. Did you ever appear in Playboy magazine?

A. Yes, I did.

MR. KELLY: Objection, relevance.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Do you have a web page presently?

MR. KELLY: Objection, relevance.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) In the web page did you have -- do you appear
without clothes?

MR. KELLY: Objection, relevance, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, this goes to the issue of bias.

MR. PETROCELLI: No speaking objections, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, did you ever, at any time during the criminal
trial, report what you've just told this jury, to the Police
Department?

A. No, I did not.

Q. Now, you were aware of the murders in June of 1994, were you not,
from all the media hype on this incident?

A. Yes, I was, but I was in the process of moving at the time.

Q. Well, the trial went on for nine months, and you were aware that
there was some issue of domestic violence during that time, were you
not?

A. Yes, I was. And I was also aware that they had decided not to use
it.

MR. BAKER: I move to strike everything after "yes, I was."

THE COURT: Stricken.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, so this -- your report of this incident, during
the entire nine months of the criminal trial, was never made to the
LAPD, was never made to the D.A.'s office, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And now -- in terms of your recollection of this event, you seem
now to have a pretty clear recollection of an event that took place
some 13 years ago, correct?

A. I wouldn't say that it's that clear, but, yeah, correct.

Q. And how much time did you spend with Mr. Kelly before you got on
the witness stand here today?

A. Probably about 15 minutes.

Q. And how much time did you spend looking at pictures before you got
on the witness stand here today?

A. Actually, none.

Q. Never looked at those pictures that you've seen here?

A. I've seen one shot of the fur coat picture.

Q. Okay.

A. That's it.

Q. And how much time did you spend with the other plaintiffs other
than Mr. Kelly.

A. The other plaintiffs?

Q. Yeah. Mr. Petrocelli.

A. Oh, Mr. Petrocelli. I met with Mr. Petrocelli one time, just to
tell him my story.

Q. When was that?

A. I believe it was in February.

Q. How long did you spend with him then?

A. He spent about 25, 30 minutes with me; not much time.

Q. And now, you say that this occurred, you believe, in 1983?

A. Yes, I believe it was, yeah.

Q. What month?

A. I'm not sure.

Q. Do you know whether it was in the summer? Do you know whether she
was wearing a fur coat in the summer, the winter, the fall, the
spring?

A. I think it was spring, but I'm not positive.

Q. And you said in terms of Mr. Simpson, that he was driving a blue
Rolls Royce. You have a pretty clear recollection then?

A. I think it was. I remember it was a dark color.

Q. But you're really clear?

A. I'm pretty sure.

Q. A Rolls Royce is a pretty distinctive car?

A. Yes.

Q. And you have no doubt in your mind, as you sit here today, that Mr.
Simpson got out of a Rolls Royce in 1983, correct?

A. I'm pretty sure it was.

Q. Well, I mean --

A. When I -- I was not that sophisticated back then so I -- I wasn't a
connoisseur of car models, so I'm not positive.

Q. I understand that. I'm not trying to assert that you are. But a
Rolls Royce doesn't look like any other car? At least to me it
doesn't.

A. No.

It was a big car, yes.

Q. Your best recollection is it was a blue or dark Rolls Royce, right?

A. Yes.

Q. And you indicated that they exchanged words and you have a clear
recollection, as you sit here now, of this incident 13 years ago, that
Mr. Simpson was gritting his teeth? You recall that?

A. Yes. Yeah, he was mad, he was very angry. That's one thing I
remembered.

Q. All right.

A. Yes.

Q. You recall looking specifically at his fists, and both of the fists
were clenched, right?

A. Yes.

Q. Who was this employee that went out with you that put the food in
the car of Ms. Simpson?

A. I think his name was Greg or Paul. And -- he was another assistant
that worked there.

Q. And what was his last name?

A. I'm not sure.

Q. How long did he work there?

A. I have no idea. Longer than I did. He was a professional.

Q. Now, the recollection that you have of this incident some 13 years
ago, is that -- well, strike that.

Where was the dog food placed in Ms. Simpson's car?

A. It was in the -- they put it in the trunk.

Q. Where were the dogs placed by Ms. Simpson when she put them in?

A. One of them rode in the front seat and the other one was kind of
squished in the middle.

Q. Now, you said -- in response to a questions by Mr. Kelly, you
indicated that you always get mixed up between the coat and the pants,
the colors?

A. No, not the coat. The pants and the car.

Q. Oh, that's right. I'm sorry.

A. Yeah.

Q. Well, how many times have you told this story that you always get
mixed up?

A. I've told it to my family a number of times over the years, just
because it was the only time I'd ever seen two people like that fight.

Q. I see.

So -- and it always kind of -- you get them mixed up, the color of the
pants and the color of the automobile; is that right?

A. Yes.

Q. I see.

Now, in terms of your recollection, you have a clear recollection that
Ms. Simpson (sic) backed out earlier after they had words earlier,
that they were going to discuss this further at home?

A. Um-hum.

Q. And you saw Mr. Simpson's hand come in contact with Ms. Simpson,
correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay. Where?

A. On her check, her face; right there.

Q. Open handed?

A. It was open handed, yes, it was.

Q. And this is -- you have no problem with your recollection of this
event 13 years ago, correct?

A. No.

Q. And the only thing you didn't do is you didn't report it to the
LAPD or the D.A.'s office at any time during the investigation of the
case, or during the trial, and only came forward in February of 1996
for this case, true?

A. That's correct, yes.

MR. BAKER: I don't have anything further.

REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. KELLY:

Q. Was there a particular reason -- first of all, you were aware of
the criminal trial going on, were you not?

A. Yes, I was.

Q. And I think Mr. Baker asked you if you knew whether domestic
violence was an issue in that or not.

A. Yes.

Q. Did you know?

A. I did know, but I heard that they were not going to make an issue
of it, so I didn't think there was any reason for me to come forward,
'cause it wasn't going to be allowed in the trial.

Q. Did you intend at the time to come forward?

A. I would have if they would have needed me, yes.

Q. Okay. Was there any --

MR. BAKER: Move to strike. Objection to speculation.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) Was there any other personal reason that you didn't
want to, if you could avoid it, testify at the criminal trial?

A. Yeah. Well, I -- I -- I've retired from being a model, and I had
seen a little taste of that, and I didn't want it. I have two kids,
and I retired for a reason, not to be involved in it any more.

Q. Was there any physical condition at that time?

A. Yeah, I was pregnant at that time also.

MR. KELLY: Okay. I have no further questions.

THE WITNESS: Thank you.

RECROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. BAKER:

Q. Well, now, in 1994, as I understand it, you had retired and you
didn't want to have any more of a career in the public limelight,
correct?

A. I did one more job after that. It wasn't really a job, though.

Q. Actually, in 1995, you appeared nude in Cigar Aficionado magazine,
did you not?

MR. KELLY: Objection, relevance.

THE COURT: You opened it. Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Did you not?

A. Yeah. That was the one job I was talking about.

Q. And you certainly wanted the limelight if you appeared without any
clothes, in a magazine, smoking a cigar, did you not?

MR. KELLY: Objection, argumentative.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. I thought it was very artistic and a beautiful layout. It was one
of the best I ever did.

Q. And one of the -- you also appeared in an unrated film, "Seduce
Me," did you not?

MR. KELLY: Objection, relevance.

THE COURT: As to time, sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Isn't it true, Ms. Allen, that you want to resurrect
your fledgling acting career and you came forward with this because of
that?

A. No. I can't really work with a big belly anyway. I'm getting ready
to have another baby, so...

Q. And you had already had how many babies when you appeared without
clothes on in Cigar Aficionado magazine?

A. I had had one, and had one on the way, actually.

MR. BAKER: Thank you. Nothing further.

MR. KELLY: Nothing further, Your Honor.

THE COURT: You may step down.

THE WITNESS: Thank you.

THE COURT: Call your next witness.

MR. KELLY: I'd also like to move in 2222.

THE COURT: Received.

(The instrument herein described was received in evidence as
Plaintiffs' Exhibit No. 2222.)

THE CLERK: Can we get a spelling of Ms. Rose. Is it R-o-s-e?

THE WITNESS: Yes, it is.

THE CLERK: Thank you.

MR. KELLY: Albert Aguilera, please.

ALBERT AGUILERA, called as a witness on behalf of Plaintiffs, was duly
sworn and testified as follows:

THE CLERK: You do solemnly swear that the testimony you may give in
the cause now pending before this court shall be the truth, the whole
truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

THE WITNESS: I do.

THE CLERK: Please be seated.

And, sir, would you please state and spell your name for the record.

THE WITNESS: Albert Aguilera. Last name A-g-u-i-l-e-r-a.

THE CLERK: Albert, A-l-b-e-r-t?

THE WITNESS: Yes. DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. KELLY:

Q. Good morning, sir.

A. Morning.

Q. You currently employed?

A. Yes.

Q. And what type of work do you do?

A. I'm a pharmacist in retail.

Q. And did you receive a doctorate in pharmacy?

A. A doctorate pharmacy degree, yes.

Q. And where did you receive that from?

A. From the University of Southern California.

Q. And what years did attend U.S.C. prior to receiving your doctorate
there?

A. 1965 to 1969.

Q. And when you were attending U.S.C., did you have occasion to know
who O.J. Simpson was?

A. Yes.

Q. And why did you have occasion to know that?

A. Well, everybody knew about the SC football team. We were doing
great. During the whole four years I was there, we did very well.

Q. Did you ever see Mr. Simpson on campus when you were there?

A. Yes, on numerous occasions.

Q. You were familiar with his appearance?

A. Oh, yes.

Q. Knew him by sight?

A. Oh, yeah.

Q. Okay.

Now, I want to draw your attention to approximately July 1, 1986.

Do you recall where you were living at that time?

A. I lived in Laguna Beach at a place called the Blue Lagoon.

Q. And who did you live there with?

A. Art Sorce.

Q. And did Art Sorce have any affiliation with football himself?

A. Yes. He was a former All American from Colorado, and he also played
briefly with the Green Bay Packers.

Q. Now, going back -- going back to early July, 1986, do you recall
having an occasion to be on Victoria Beach one afternoon?

A. Yes, we were walking on the beach that day.

Q. When you say we, who were you walking with?

A. Art Sorce.

Q. Okay.

And do you recall where you had started walking from?

A. We started from Blue Lagoon, which is the south end of Victoria
Beach.

Q. And proceeded in what direction?

A. Proceeded north, walking down the water.

Q. Okay.

And do you recall what time of day it was, approximately?

A. Middle of the day, between 12, 1, 2, o'clock.

Q. And what, if anything, did you observe or anyone, did you observe,
as you were walking along at that time?

A. As we were walking and talking, about three-fourths up the way --
of the way up the beach, we saw O.J. and Nicole.

Q. Okay.

Were you walking on the sand or in the water at this time?

A. In the water.

Q. And how far out in the water were you, when you were walking along?

A. About 15, 20 yards in.

Q. And how far away were you from Mr. Simpson and Nicole when you
first observed them?

A. Oh, probably were about 50, 60 yards away.

Q. And after first observing them, what, if anything, did you continue
to observe about them at this time?

A. Well, she was standing in front of him, he was facing the beach,
she had her back to us and she was --

Q. When you say he was facing the beach, you mean the water or the
sand?

A. He was facing the water.

Q. Okay.

And she was facing?

A. She was facing him. She was standing in front of him so she had her
back to us. She was -- looked -- appeared like she was teasing, him or
laughing and kind of animated in front of him.

Q. Were you able to observe him at that time also?

A. Yes. He had a more serious look on his face, and was standing
still.

Q. Okay.

And what, if anything, did you observe next?

A. Well, I was -- as we watched him and -- we would walk, and as we
got almost directly in front of him, suddenly he slapped her and she
fell down.

Q. All right.

When you say he slapped her, what exactly did you observe Mr. Simpson
do at that time?

A. He swung his right hand and hit her across the face. And she went
down.

Q. And how far were you from them when you made this observation?

A. About 30 yards.

Q. Okay.

What, if anything, happened next?

A. We kept walking and watching. And he crouched down over her. First
looked like he was consoling her. Then he became agitated. And she --
couple times I heard her say, no, no, and it appeared to be in a
crying voice.

Q. When you saw her go down, did she fall to the side, or how did she
exactly fall?

A. Almost straight down.

Q. Okay.

And she was -- when she was on the ground, what position was she in on
the ground at this time?

A. She was on her knees.

Q. Okay.

A. On the sand.

Q. Okay.

A. He was crouching over her.

Q. Okay.

And you indicated there was some conversation between them?

A. Couldn't hear the conversation. I heard her say no, no, at least
twice.

Q. Okay.

What happened next?

A. We kept walking, and looking back, and didn't know what to think.
She suddenly stood up and ran away from the -- towards the back of the
beach, away from the beach area.

Q. Okay.

Directly away from the water at this time?

A. Um-hum. Yes.

Q. What happened next?

A. Then we -- we -- at this point we were turning around, walking
back, and we kept looking to see if he was going to pursue her. And he
didn't; he stayed a little while longer. And we looked back once, and
he was walking away in her direction.

Q. Okay.

I'm going to ask you to look up on the screen there, Mr. Aguilera
(referring to Exhibit 2194).

Do you recognize the individual in that photograph?

A. Yes. Nicole Simpson.

Q. Is that the person you saw Mr. Simpson hit that day on the beach?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

MR. KELLY: I have no further questions.

THE COURT: Cross.

CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. BAKER:

Q. Mr. Aguilera, what year was this that this event allegedly took
place?

A. 1986.

Q. You're sure of that?

A. Yes.

Q. And that's what you testified in Mr. Simpson's custody hearing last
-- two weeks --

MR. KELLY: Objection. Could we approach, briefly?

THE COURT: Yes.

(The following proceedings were held at the bench, with the reporter.)

MR. KELLY: Your Honor, I believe that the custody proceeding is a
totally sealed proceeding, both the transcript and everything
testified to therein.

I would object to any potential impeachment Mr. Baker may be
contemplating with regard to this witness and that testimony.

MR. BAKER: Well, Your Honor, you can't testify one place independent,
perjure one thing and someplace else. Regardless of whether he -- --
that whole custody thing is such a -- you know -- I mean, Mr. Kelly's
associate in this case is -- his associate in this case is pursuing
that case down there.

They're using the very same witnesses.

If they're going to misrepresent the truth in one case, they're going
to misrepresent the truth in the other case.

I think I'm entitled to go through this. I've got transcripts of this
guy down there. I think I'm entitled to go into it.

MR. PETROCELLI: I object to -- I want to object to this record -- I've
had zero access to any of the materials or the transcripts in that
case. I don't have access to Simpson's transcript. I don't know what
Mr. Kelly's position is regarding access, but it seems fundamentally
unfair if there's a sealing order in that case and Mr. Baker has
testimony that I don't have.

That's number one.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. KELLY: Thank you.

(The following proceedings were held in open court in the presence of
the jury.)

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now, this event that you say you witnessed was July
4, 1986, right?

A. No.

Q. When was it?

A. Approximately two or three days before.

Q. You told -- well, strike that.

By the way, you didn't report this to the LAPD, did you? It was your
ex-wife that did, true?

A. No.

Q. You're saying you reported it to the LAPD, your purported viewing
of this incident, Mr. Aguilera?

A. I didn't report it to the LAPD.

Q. You had a statement taken by the D.A's office, did you not?

A. Yes.

Q. On December 17, 1994?

A. Correct.

Q. I take it that your recollection of this incident that occurred two
or three days before July 4th of 1986 was better than it is now?

A. No.

Q. You told the interviewer that it was -- you're pretty sure it was
1987, when you were interviewed in December of 1994, correct?

A. No.

Q. Let me read from your statement. Page 1.

MR. PETROCELLI: Object. This is not his statement. This is -- there's
got to be some foundation laid that he saw this, reviewed this, and so
forth.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Lay a foundation.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Were you investigated by Investigator Mike Stevens,
with Investigator Dana Thompson, on December 17, 1994 at approximately
3:25 p.m.?

A. Yes.

MR. KELLY: Objection --

MR. PETROCELLI: He said investigated.

MR. KELLY: Form. Investigated.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. BAKER: I'm sorry.

MR. KELLY: You said investigated.

MR. BAKER: I apologize; I misspoke.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Were you interviewed by Investigator Mike Stevens,
with Investigator Dana Thompson, on December 17, 1994 at 3:25 p.m. in
the afternoon?

A. Yes.

Q. And you were aware that a recorded statement was being taken of
what you were -- the questions that were being asked of you and the
answers you were giving, true?

A. Correct.

Q. And you were asked about this purported incident that you say you
witnessed in 1986, right?

A. Correct.

Q. And you told the investigators that you were pretty sure it was
1987, isn't that true?

A. No.

Q. Okay.

And have you -- you've seen the transcript of your interview, have you
not?

A. Yes.

Q. And I'm showing you a copy of the transcript of your interview,
correct?

A. Um-hum.

Q. And when you were asked about the incident you observed, what year,
you said, I'm pretty sure it was '87, did you not?

MR. KELLY: Can you continue reading, Mr. Baker.

MR. BAKER: Let me ask these questions, will you, Mr. Kelly.

THE COURT: Sustained.

You may proceed.

A. At that time, yes.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) And you -- you told them that it was the 4th of
July, or the day before the 4th, correct?

A. No.

Q. You want to read what you told them?

A. I know what's on there. That isn't what I told them.

Q. So the transcript of the investigators is incorrect, true?

A. There's quite a few inaccuracies in that transcript.

Q. So -- and the reason that you now say that it's incorrect is
because you subsequently learned, did you not, that O.J. Simpson was
never in Victoria Beach on July 3, July 4 of any year, because he was
hosting a charity softball game; isn't that true?

A. That's not true, no.

Q. Of course if Mr. Simpson were hosting a charity softball game on
July 3 and July 4, you couldn't have seen him at Victoria Beach. You
would agree with that?

MR. KELLY: Objection, argumentative.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Now let's talk a little bit about what you say you
purportedly observed.

Now, it's three days or so before July 4, is that it, sir?

A. Yes, that's correct.

Q. And you were 15 to 20 yards from the water, right?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, this purported day that you say you saw this, July 1 or
whatever it was -- what day of the week was that, sir?

A. It was about Wednesday, Wednesday or the day before.

Q. And it wasn't the holiday weekend, then, huh?

A. Well, it was -- the holiday weekend was coming up. 4th of July was
Saturday.

Q. Well, was there a lot of people around the beach -- that beach is
pretty crowded, isn't it, in July?

A. No, it's not.

MR. KELLY: Objection, argumentative. Time frame, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) The houses are 60 feet wide and they adjoin each
other along the whole beach, don't they, sir?

A. That's true.

Q. And the people can walk out of their houses on the beach, can they
not, sir?

A. Yes.

Q. And there are generally a lot of people and kids playing in the
summer, during the time period that you say you observed this
incident, isn't that true, sir?

A. Not generally, no.

Q. You say it's untrue that there are a lot of people on the beach in
July, say July 2, 3 or 4, 1986?

MR. KELLY: Objection, argumentative, Your Honor. We need specific date
and time and place; not generally.

THE COURT: I'll sustain the objection.

MR. BAKER: On what grounds sir?

THE COURT: Specificity.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Early July -- had you ever been on that beach in
early July before this purported time that you say you saw Nicole
Brown Simpson in 1986, sir?

A. Yes.

Q. And is it your testimony as you -- or before this jury today, that
you believe that beach is an uncrowded beach in the July time frame?

MR. KELLY: Objection, vague, argumentative.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. Yes.

Q. And so were you and this friend of yours, who isn't available to
testify, did you see anybody else on the beach that day besides you
two?

A. There were a few people on the beach, yes.

Q. Were there any other witnesses to this event -- strike that.

How long is Victoria Beach, Mr. Aguilera?

A. It's about, I'd say, 400 yards at the most.

Q. And how deep is it till the houses start?

A. Another 50 yards from the water, I think.

Q. And so there's -- and that's all sand, isn't it, up to those
houses?

A. Yes.

Q. And that's a beach that's used not only by the people that live
there, but by people who park their cars and walk into that beach
area, correct?

A. They can.

MR. KELLY: Objection, argumentative, vague.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. If they can find parking, yes.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) And that beach is a pretty popular beach down in
Laguna, is it not?

A. I wouldn't say it's real popular, no.

Q. What was the -- you were out, in the water was it -- you say 15 to
20 yards from the waterline to where you and this friend of yours were
walking, right?

A. Right.

Q. And you say that Nicole Brown Simpson and O.J. Simpson were 150 to
180 feet away from you, correct?

MR. KELLY: Objection, misstates the testimony.

A. No.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You said 50 to 60 yards away. That's what you
testified to?

A. When I first saw them, not when we were right in front of them, no.

Q. So you were in the water, Nicole Brown Simpson was not facing you,
and you say that you observed her teasing Mr. Simpson, right?

A. Yes.

Q. You didn't see her face?

A. No.

Q. You didn't -- couldn't hear her because there were waves breaking
and they were a distance away from you, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. So you didn't hear her and you couldn't see her, but you knew she
was teasing you (sic), right?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

This transcript is incorrect although there is an audio tape of this,
isn't there?

A. I think so.

Q. And you're sure on that audio tape that you didn't say the 3rd or
the 4th of July, correct?

A. I don't recall, no.

Q. Well, let's get this straight. This is important.

You've testified here in questions I've asked you, sir, that it -- and
the questions that Mr. Kelly asked you about July 1, and this
transcript of your recorded statement to the police in December of
1994 indicates July 3 or July 4.

Now, which was it?

A. 1st.

Q. You're sure of that?

A. It wasn't the 4th or the 3rd, I'm sure of that, yes.

Q. And you're sure that on the audio tape it is going to say, not July
3 or 4th, that was a mistake, it's going to say July 1, right?

A. It will say -- it will be -- the audio will back me up, but I
wasn't sure which date it was. It wasn't the 4th or the 3rd.

Q. You never mentioned July 1, at any time, to the Los Angeles Police
Department on December 17, 1994, did you, sir?

A. I didn't talk to the Los Angeles Police Department.

Q. The investigators. Pardon me.

A. They were from the D.A.'s office.

Q. The investigators?

A. Yes.

Q. You never mentioned July 1 at all, did you, sir?

A. No, that's not true.

Q. The fact that it doesn't appear anyplace, you still believe that
you mentioned it was July 1, 1986, as contrasted to another date?

A. That's correct.

Q. All right.

Now, you indicated to the investigators that you were 30 to 40 yards
away from them at the time you observed the incident, correct?

A. It's approximate.

Q. You were 90 to 120 feet away from these two individuals?

A. Possibly closer to 20 yards.

Q. Well, you said, when you were asked, and how far again were you now
approximately 30 to 40 yards away, but directly in front. That's what
you told the police or the investigators -- D.A. investigators on
December 17, 1994, correct?

A. That's about right.

Q. And so, as I understand it, Nicole Brown Simpson, according to your
testimony, never even turned around while you were out in the water,
waves are breaking, Mr. Simpson and Nicole Brown Simpson are up on the
sand some 90 to 120 feet away, and you hear what they say; is that
right?

A. I didn't hear what she said, no.

Q. Well, I thought you said you heard -- well, strike that.

Is it your testimony now you didn't hear any comments of Nicole Brown
Simpson?

A. No, I didn't hear any conversation.

Q. Is it your testimony, sir, that when you were 90 to 120 feet away
out in the water, surf breaking, and the Simpsons are in front of you,
that you heard or didn't hear anything that was said between the two
of them, yes or no?

A. I heard -- I heard some things, yes.

Q. So you heard, as you testified here, Nicole Brown Simpson say no,
no, in a crying voice in between the surf, and being 90 and 120 feet
away, you could discern all of that, right?

A. I was pretty focused at this time.

Q. You could discern all of it, you heard what she said, you noticed
the connotation that it was a crying voice, you knew all of that from
your location 90 to 120 feet away, right?

A. Yes.

Q. All right. Thank you.

Now, and you observed Mr. Simpson stay there, you say, after -- a
while after Nicole Brown Simpson left the area?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

Let me show you this page 2 of the statement and ask you if you
remember the question asked by Investigator Stevens, where he says do
you remember the specific date, month and day.

Do you remember your response to that?

A. That isn't accurate, what it says there.

Q. Is it your testimony -- your response, according to the transcript
of the tape, that you had seen before you testified today was, quote,
it was either the 4th of July morning or the day before the 4th of
July, correct? That's what this transcript indicates, true?

A. That's what is says there, yes.

Q. And you, of course, say now, that you would never say -- have said
that it was the 3rd or the 4th of July, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. Okay.

And you don't know why that it appears in two places in the matter of
about 10 questions, the 3rd and 4th of July, as contrasted to what you
now say is the date, that being the 1st of July, right?

A. I can't account for that, no.

Q. And you have no explanation for that at all, right?

A. No.

Q. And by the way, sir, how many television shows have you been on
relative to this purported story of July 4, 1986?

MR. KELLY: Objection, relevance.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. Zero.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Well, how about "CBS This Morning," the name of the
show being "CBS This Morning," you been on that show?

A. They taped me on my beach.

Q. Well, didn't you think that when they taped you on your beach, that
you were going to be on the show?

A. I thought you were referring if I was in the studio. They
interviewed me.

Q. And you haven't shied away from publicity in this case, have you,
sir?

A. That's not true.

Q. How about the "L.A. Times," did you grant them an interview telling
your purported story?

A. Yes.

Q. Did you ever -- after you saw the transcript that I put in front of
you at least three times today, did you ever ask anybody from the LA
D.A.'s office to change any of the remarks that are attributed to you
in that statement?

A. Those are -- those remarks, the first time I saw them was last week
sometime.

Q. Did you ever ask anybody from the LA D.A.'s office to change any of
the remarks that were attributed to you in that statement?

A. Never had an opportunity.

Q. In the last week, you have never had an opportunity and you've
never asked to hear the same tape?

A. First time I --

MR. KELLY: Objection.

A. -- Wednesday morning.

THE COURT: Excuse me.

MR. BAKER: I don't have anything further of this witness.

REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. KELLY:

Q. Mr. Aguilera, have you ever made a nickel from anyone or anything
with regard to your observations that day in July, 1986?

A. No.

Q. Okay.

With regard to July 4th in '86, do you recall what day of the week
that was on?

A. Saturday.

Q. And were you even in Blue Lagoon where you were living at the time,
on that day, July 4th?

A. No.

Q. Do you recall when you had left there that early July, 1986?

A. I left about Thursday.

Q. Okay.

And is that why you can remember now what date it was that you made
those observations?

MR. BAKER: Leading and suggestive.

A. Yes.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) Do you have any reason you specifically recall what
date it would have been you made these observations?

A. Yes. When Art and I were walking on the beach, one of the things we
were talking about was whether I was going to stick around for the
4th. I told him I didn't think so.

Q. Now, Mr. Baker also made reference to this friend of yours who was
unavailable to testify here today -- that you were walking along with
that day.

What was his name again?

A. Art Sorce.

Q. Is he, in fact, unavailable to testify here at this time, before
the ladies and gentlemen of the jury?

A. Yes.

Q. And why is that?

A. He passed away.

Q. How long ago?

A. In 1989.

Q. Okay.

And also, you were asked about testifying a certain way because you
had learned of Mr. Simpson engaging in a charity softball event, or
something on the 4th of July, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Have you ever learned anything, at any time, about any of Mr.
Simpson's activities, prior to your testifying here?

A. No.

Q. Okay.

And one last thing: You were asked about whether at Victoria Beach
there is -- it is crowded or not.

First of all, did you observe any other people on the beach that day,
at that time when you made those observations?

A. Mainly, there was 8 to 10 people on the beach that day.

Q. Was there anyone closer, that you could see?

A. No.

Q. Now, is there any public access to Victoria Beach where you made
those observations?

A. At the north end of the beach, yes.

Q. Okay.

But in the area you made these observations, is that --

A. Pretty much from the homes that are right on the beach.

Q. Okay.

There's no public parking there either?

A. No.

Q. And was it your experience, down there, that this was generally not
too crowded an area during the week on that beach?

A. During the week, yes.

Q. Okay.

MR. KELLY: I have no further questions.

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, I want to be heard on this issue, on the other
hearing issue.

(The following proceedings were held at the bench with reporter:)

MR. BAKER: When he asked about did you hear from any source about Mr.
Simpson's charity softball game or anything else, I think he's opened
the door to those custody hearings because he testified to those
custody hearings and he testified on the 3rd and 4th is my
recollection, and I don't have the transcript here.

THE COURT: Okay.

MR. KELLY: Your Honor, I was just asking a question in response to Mr.
Baker's cross-examination. That was it.

THE COURT: I will not reopen it. Denied. (The following proceedings
were held in open court in the presence of the jury.)
RECROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. BAKER:

Q. Were you interviewed by "The Globe," Mr. Anguilera?

A. No, I was not.

Q. Your ex-wife reported this whole incident that you say occurred to
"The Globe," correct?

MR. KELLY: Objection, hearsay.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You were aware, because you were subsequently
contacted after this appeared in "The Globe" by the LAPD or LA D.A.'s
office, that your wife had put your purported rendition of this event
in "The Globe," correct?

MR. KELLY: Same objection.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. BAKER: On what grounds, sir.

THE COURT: It's hearsay.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Did you ever read this article -- any article in
"The Globe" relating to this purported event?

MR. KELLY: Objection.

THE COURT: You can answer yes or no.

A. Yes.

Q. Did you read the portion that is attributed to you in the article?

A. Yes.

Q. And is it your testimony, as you sit here today, that you never had
any interview with "The Globe" whatsoever?

A. I never even talked to my ex-wife about this incident.

Q. I didn't ask you if you talked to your wife about it. I asked you
if you, in fact, talked to "The Globe" about it.

MR. KELLY: Objection, asked and answered.

THE COURT: Overruled.

You may answer.

A. No, I did not.

Q. And so the -- what is it attributed to the -- to you in "The
Globe," you never said that either?

A. That's correct.

Q. Now, did you -- did you indicate to the police that you could hear
Nicole talking from 90 to 120 feet away to -- to Mr. Simpson?

MR. KELLY: Objection, improper recross.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Did you, at any time, indicate to anyone, that you
could hear Nicole Brown Simpson communicating with O.J. Simpson when
you were 30 yards out in the water, waves crashing, and Mr. and Mrs.
Simpson were up on the beach?

MR. KELLY: Same objection.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) So all of these comments that you made to the
investigators in the LA D.A.'s office, indicating that when you
purportedly saw this incident, being the 3rd or 4th of July, are
absolutely incorrect, and you have no explanation, whatsoever, how
they could have mixed up the 1st of July for the 3rd or 4th?

A. That's correct.

MR. KELLY: Same objection, argumentative and compound.

MR. BAKER: I don't have anything else.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. KELLY: Nothing further.

THE COURT: You may step down.

MR. GELBLUM: Your Honor, we need to go a little bit out of order
because of the subject matter, because of scheduling. Charles Cale is
the next witness.

THE CLERK: Sir, if you step up behind the court reporter. Right there
is fine.

Please raise your right hand to be sworn.

CHARLES CALE was called as a witness on behalf of the Plaintiffs, was
duly sworn and testified as follows:

THE CLERK: You do solemnly swear that the testimony you may give in
the cause now pending before this court shall be the truth, the whole
truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

THE WITNESS: I do.

THE CLERK: Thank you. Please be seated.

And, sir, if you would please state and spell your name for the
record.

THE WITNESS: My name is Charles, C-h-a-r-l-e-s, Griffin,
G-r-i-f-f-i-n, Cale, C-a-l-e.

A. I live on North Rockingham Avenue.

Q. How far away from Mr. Simpson's house?

A. Several hundred yards.

Q. Do you know where Mr. Simpson lives?

A. Yes, sir, I do.

Q. Which direction from Mr. Simpson's house?

A. I live north on Rockingham -- from the corner of Ashford and
Rockingham.

Q. How long have you lived there?

Q. Since about 1982?

A. I'm a self-employed investor, private trustee, and corporate
director.

Q. Okay.

And in your career, have you ever done any work with the Olympic
movement?

A. Yes, sir, I have.

Q. What's that?

A. I was Group Vice President of Sports and responsible for sports in
a number of other areas for the 1984 Olympic Games with the Los
Angeles Olympic Organizing Committee. That was the 1982 to 1984
organization.

From 1985 through 1992, I was assistant to the president of the United
States Olympic Committee and Assistant Chief of the United States
Olympic team in South Korea in 1988.

Q. What year?

A. 1988.

Q. And have you been involved with any other sporting organizations?

MR. BAKER: Objection, relevance.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. Yes, sir, I have.

Q. What's that?

A. I was a member of the board, co-chairman and CEO of the World Cup
Organizing Committee for the Soccer World Cup, CEO and co-chairman for
a year, little over a year, and member of the board for a total of
about five years.

Q. That was the World Cup just held in the United States?

A. In 1994.

Q. You lived up the street from Mr.Simpson on June 12, 1994?

A. Yes, I did.

Q. Did you walk your dog that night?

A. Yes, sir, I did.

Q. About what time?

A. Neighborhood of 9:30 to 9:45.

Q. How do you know it was that time?

A. Well, I was leaving for a trip early the next morning, it's a trip
I regularly take, or not irregularly at least, and I was having to
leave my house before 7 and get up at 6, and when I do that I pack the
evening before and make sure that I get in bed by approximately 10
o'clock or shortly thereafter.

Q. That's a routine you have when you take this trip?

A. Yes, sir, it is.

And that evening I went out with the dog, after I packed, and before I
turned in.

MR. GELBLUM: Steve, can you put up Exhibit 2067, please. (The
instrument herein described as an aerial photograph of North
Rockingham Avenue and Ashford Avenue was marked for identification as
Plaintiffs' Exhibit 2067.)

Q. Do you recognize what's on the monitor?

A. Yes, sir. It's a little hard from this angle, but it --

Q. If you want to get up, you can go ahead and get up.

A. It's North Rockingham Avenue, and the street coming in from the
right appears to be Ashford.

May I?

Q. Sure.

(Witness stepped down from the witness stand to view Exhibit 2067.)

A. Yes.

Q. It appears -- there should be a pointer on the stand up there.

Just show generally what direction you live.

Can you point out Mr. Simpson's house, first of all.

A. This -- I believe this is Ashford. It comes into Rockingham. This
is North Rockingham. Mr. Simpson's property is at this corner, which
would be the southeast corner of Rockingham and Ashford.

(Witness indicates.)

Q. And you live?

A. I live in the northerly direction, yes, sir.

Q. Now, that night on June 12, did you walk south on Rockingham at
all?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. From your house?

A. Yes, sir. At the conclusion of my walk, I believe I started up,
perhaps, to the north, and then walked back down south, and then
turned around and went back to my house.

Q. How far was the farthest point south you got on Rockingham?

A. To my best recollection, it's right in this area here.

Q. Okay.

A. Down in the area of the -- of the -- somewhere by the driveway, I
remember the property there, or slightly south.

Q. It's the first driveway on the east side of Rockingham, north of
Ashford?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. For the record, it's, I'd say, about halfway down from the top of
the photograph to Ashford.

A. Yes, sir. I'd say, again, in this area here.

Q. Okay.

Did you have a clear view down south on Rockingham?

A. Yes.

Q. Are there street lights?

A. There's some, yes, sir. There's one street light right here at the
corner.

Q. You can take a seat.

(Witness complies.)

Q. When you took your walk between 9:30 and 9:45, was there a car
parked on the east side of Rockingham, between Ashford and the
Rockingham driveway, from Mr. Simpson's property?

A. No, sir, there was not.

Q. Was there a car parked anywhere between -- if I can have the
pointer, please.

(Witness hands pointer to counsel.)

Q. Anywhere between Ashford, here on the north, and this driveway of
Mr. Simpson's estate, here on the east side?

A. No, I don't believe there was a car anywhere on Rockingham, that I
could see, down south.

Q. And you believe that was between 9:30 and 9:45 on June 12?

A. Yes, sir. I would say closer to 9:45.

Q. Did you see anybody walking out in that area, while you were out?

A. No, sir, I did not.

Q. Did you see the defendant, Mr. Simpson?

A. No, sir, I did not.

Q. Now, as of that night, June 12, 1994, you had lived up the street
from Mr. Simpson for about 12 years; is that right?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And during those 12 years, on the average, how many times did you
drive down Rockingham, past Mr. Simpson's property, how frequently?

A. More than once a day I would pass that -- his property.

Q. Okay.

And in all that time, do you recall ever once having seen a white Ford
Bronco parked on the east side of Rockingham, by Mr. Simpson's
property?

A. No, sir, I did not.

MR. BAKER: Objection.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. GELBLUM) Now, did you ever see a white Ford Bronco parked
on Ashford?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. Frequently?

A. Not infrequently.

Q. Now, the next morning you said you had to catch a plane?

A. That's correct.

Q. What time did you leave your house?

A. Slightly before 7 in the morning.

Q. What route did you take?

A. We came out and went south on Rockingham, and we're going to turn
left, normally we would turn -- turn left on -- on Ashford and go
across to Cliffwood, but I -- we saw there was a -- a police car
parked just east of the intersection, sort of between Rockingham and
the gate on Ashford of Mr. Simpson's property, so I was -- I was being
dropped off at the airport, and I said, let's turn, I don't know what
that is, let's keep going south on Rockingham.

Q. And you proceeded past Mr. Simpson's property on Rockingham?

A. That is correct.

Q. Did you see a white Ford Bronco parked outside Mr. Simpson's house
at the time?

A. Yes, sir, I did.

Q. Where was it parked?

A. It was parked north of the Rockingham gate, on the east side of
Rockingham, pointed north.

Q. Can you point to approximately where you saw it?

(Witness indicates.)

MR. GELBLUM: Can you see?

Q. Can you stand on the other side so the jury can see.

A. Excuse me.

It was here at the Rockingham gate, and it was right -- right in that
area.

Q. Thank you.

MR. GELBLUM: I have no further questions.

THE COURT: Cross.

CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. BAKER:

Q. Mr. Cale, as I understand it, from 9:30 to 9:45 you started -- can
you put that back on the Elmo, please, on the monitor -- you started
north of Mr. Simpson's home and then you proceeded down south,
correct?

A. That's my recollection, yes.

Q. And you didn't see any cars on Rockingham, parked on either side of
the street, right?

A. That is correct.

Q. You didn't see a limo driver come down the street, up Rockingham
towards Ashford, either, did you?

A. Not when I was out there, no, sir, I did not.

Q. You didn't see a limousine driver pull down Ashford, did you?

A. No, sir, I did not.

Q. You didn't see a limousine driver, at the time you were walking,
come out of -- out of Ashford and go back down and pull in by the gate
area on Rockingham, did you?

A. I think that was covered by my prior answer. It was no.

Q. So you didn't.

And you saw -- and you didn't hear any vehicles during that time come
north or south or east or west on -- on Rockingham or Ashford,
correct?

A. That is correct.

Q. So as I understand your testimony then, it was 9:30 to 9:45, and
you were walking south on Rockingham, and it was obviously dark out,
right?

A. It was evening, yes, sir.

Q. All right.

And there was a street light over across on the north side of --

A. On the corner.

Q. Yeah.

And there's no street lights down here in the -- south of Mr.
Simpson's property, correct?

A. The predominant light is that one on the corner.

Q. All right.

And as you sit here today, as you testified in the criminal trial, you
had no recollection of seeing any vehicles whatsoever that night,
correct?

A. That is correct.

Q. And you are an attorney, are you not, sir?

A. I'm not practicing, but I'm a law school graduate and I did
practice law.

Q. You practiced law in the State of California for a while, did you
not, sir?

A. I did.

Q. And as I recall, you didn't file a report relative to any of this
until January of 1995 because you said you didn't know how to contact
the police; is that right?

A. I don't believe that's completely accurate. I think I said that I
did not know that what I had not seen had any relevance to the -- to
the matter.

Q. You made no contact, no attempts to contact the police until
January of 1995; is that correct?

A. That is correct.

Q. Now, you and other neighbors in the area certainly are not, let's
say, pleased about all of the activities that have gone on in the
neighborhood since June of 1994, correct?

A. I think that would be a safe statement.

Q. In fact, you -- would you possibly agree with me, that there have
been meetings as to how to get Mr. Simpson to leave the area; isn't
that true?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection, relevance.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. I believe that there have been.

Q. And would it be also fair to say that you've talked to your
neighborhood, and Mr. Simpson is, as the Latin phrase, persona non
gratia, he's not terribly welcome in the neighborhood because of the
June 1994 murders, and the activities that have gone on, and the
looky-loos and all that around your neighborhood; is that correct?

A. I think there have been discussions. I don't believe that I really
discussed it with people.

Q. Well, I'm sorry, sir, maybe my question wasn't very clear.

I asked you if you had -- I said you would agree with me that in the
neighborhood, because of the murders of June of 1994, Mr. Simpson is
persona non gratia in your neighborhood.

MR. GELBLUM: Objection, irrelevant.

He didn't participate.

THE COURT: It's irrelevant except as to this witness's state of mind.

You may inquire as to his state of mind, not to the neighbors.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Your state of mind is you want him out of there,
too?

A. I would prefer that there weren't looky-loos, and people that came
through the streets all the time.

Q. You would prefer that he be out of there, correct?

A. I think probably.

Q. Now, you had -- that night you didn't see, for example, did you --
you didn't see Kato Kaelin's 300ZQ that night either, did you?

A. I did not see any cars on Rockingham.

Q. Okay.

And did -- strike that.

The closest you got to Mr. Simpson's property was approximately 200
feet north of his property, as it intersects Ashford, up in this area,
correct?

A. I believe it was in the neighborhood of 200 feet. I think it was
somewhere down around the -- the driveway that I pointed out.

Q. Okay.

And you were on the east side of the street or the west side of the
street?

A. I was probably walking in the middle of the street or from side to
side as the dog dictated.

Q. And, Mr. Cale, that area where you've resided for the last 14 years
is exceedingly quiet, especially on a Sunday night, is it not?

A. It is, yes.

Q. And from where you were, 200 feet north of Mr. Simpson's property,
if a car came north on Rockingham, after it turned from Sunset onto
Rockingham and came north, you could see that car and its headlamps
half a mile --

A. I don't think --

Q. -- south?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection, calls for speculation.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. I don't know that you could as far as a half mile because of the
bend, but you could certainly see several hundreds of yards, I
believe.

Q. And so, if any vehicle had been on Rockingham and going north, you
would have seen at least the headlamps, correct, while you were
walking your dog that evening?

A. I believe, certainly, after it had passed Parkyns which is the next
street to the south.

Q. And this obviously wasn't the first time you walked your dog, I
assume, sir?

A. No, sir.

Q. And you had obviously been in tune, I take it, to some extent, to
the noise levels in the area, correct?

A. I think -- I think so, yes.

Q. All right.

And --

A. It's a fairly quiet neighborhood, if that's what you're asking.

Q. Yes.

And Parkyns is a street that goes off to the east as well below the
picture that we have on the monitor now, correct?

A. That is correct.

Q. Even before you see any headlamps, because Rockingham turns a
little bit to the east as it gets to Parkyns, doesn't it?

A. Yes, sir, it does.

Q. You could hear a vehicle if a vehicle was coming in that direction,
could you not?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection, relevance.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. I don't know that you could -- I know you could -- probably could
see the headlights a lot sooner than you could ever hear it.

Q. Okay. Thank you.

REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. GELBLUM:

Q. Mr. Baker asked you some questions about whether you saw a
limousine driving around that night.

Were you outside at 10:15, 10:20 that night?

A. No, sir, I was not.

Q. So if a limousine drove around the corner at 10:23, 10:24, 10:25,
you were not in a position to see it?

A. I was in bed, if not asleep.

Q. Mr. Baker asked you some questions about seeing headlights and
hearing cars on Rockingham.

Did you go over that night and stand by Mr. Simpson's Ashford gate and
get inside a car and turn the radio on and look for cars?

A. No, sir.

MR. BAKER: I object to the leading and his pointing as indicating
where the car was when there's no evidence of that.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. GELBLUM) Did you go on Ashford at all that night?

A. No, sir.

Q. Did you go look down Ashford to see Mr. -- whether Mr. Kaelin's
Datsun was there?

A. No, sir.

MR. GELBLUM: Nothing further.

RECROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. BAKER:

Q. Did you see any cars, sir, on Rockingham at all on June 12, 1994?

A. I thought I indicated earlier that I --

THE COURT: This is during that time period?

MR. BAKER: No. At all during --

THE COURT: There is 24 hours in a day, Mr. Baker.

MR. BAKER: I'm sorry.

THE COURT: There's 24 hours in a day.

MR. BAKER: I understand that.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Let me put it this way, did you observe any vehicles
the afternoon of the 12th?

MR. GELBLUM: Outside the scope.

THE COURT: Sustained. That is irrelevant.

You may inquire, if your question is as to the specific time period.
That's relevant. You may inquire.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Did you know in June of 1994, after Fuhrman's
testimony to the grand jury hearing, that the issue --

MR. GELBLUM: Objection.

MR. PETROCELLI: Objection.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. BAKER: How do we know what the question is?

THE COURT: Because it's -- I will sustain the objection.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You were aware in June of 1994, that the Bronco was
an issue relative to the accusations that O.J. Simpson murdered two
people on June 12, 1994, correct?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection, outside the scope of redirect.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You may answer that.

A. No, I was not.

Q. And at no time, from June of 1994 to January of 1995, did you
become aware that the Bronco was an issue relative to the innocence or
guilt of Mr. Simpson in the murders of June 12, 1994?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection, overbroad, irrelevant.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. GELBLUM: Whether the Bronco was an issue, that's a broad
statement.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Let me it put it this way, did you know the Bronco
was an element of the case?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. Same objection.

During what time period?

MR. BAKER: Let's say July of 1994.

MR. GELBLUM: We're talking about where the Bronco was parked.
Overbroad.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. BAKER: I'd like to read from the criminal trial testimony, 21201,
lines 2 through 7.

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. It's the same question you just sustained an
objection to.

MR. BAKER: Objection wasn't made at the criminal trial.

MR. GELBLUM: Same questions.

MR. PETROCELLI: Lack of foundation.

THE COURT: You may ask a question.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You knew as early as July of 1994, that the Bronco
was at least an issue in the case, did you not?

MR. GELBLUM: Same objection.

THE COURT: I'll sustain that.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You knew as early as July of 1994 that the Bronco
was at least an issue in the criminal case, being a lawyer, did you
not?

MR. GELBLUM: Objection. Same objection.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You knew it was an element in the case in July of
1994 and never talked to the police until January of 1995?

MR. GELBLUM: Same objection, compound.

THE COURT: The question was asked and answered by this witness on the
first cross-examination.

Sustained.

MR. BAKER: Nothing further.

MR. GELBLUM: Nothing further.

THE COURT: You are excused.

THE WITNESS: Thank you.

THE COURT: 1:30, ladies and gentlemen. Don't talk about the case,
don't form or express any opinions.

HON. HIROSHI FUJISAKI, JUDGE

(REGINA D. CHAVEZ, OFFICIAL REPORTER)

Whatever was said was something urgent, and I was asked to come.

exactly what was said.

Q. Okay.

And what did you do upon being asked to come to Rockingham --

A. I got up --

Q. -- if anything?

A. -- got in the car, and drove over there.

Q. Approximately how much time elapsed from the time you got the phone
call until the time you got in the car and headed over to Rockingham?

A. Minutes. At that time I was living in Santa Monica, so it wasn't --
I wasn't that far away.

Q. But what I'm asking you, from the time you received the phone call
till the time you got in the car, how much time elapsed?

A. I couldn't tell you. It could have been minutes, five minutes, ten
minutes. I really don't know.

that --

By the way, was it still dark out when you headed over to Rockingham?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

And could you tell us what you did when you arrived at Rockingham?

Came into the house, and Nicole was in the kitchen.

Q. Was there anybody with Nicole at this time in the kitchen, when you
saw her?

A. No.

Q. And was she standing or sitting?

looked like an officer's leather jacket.

was a dark color.

Q. And what was Nicole's state at this time?

What was her demeanor when you arrived there?

A. Upset, pissed.

Q. Okay.

Had she been crying?

THE WITNESS: I'm sorry.

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) Can you tell whether she had been crying or not?

A. No, I couldn't say.

Q. And could you describe her physical appearance from what you could

My concern was that she was upset and pissed off, and I was there to
assist her if she needed help.

Q. And what, if anything, did you say to her at the time when you
arrived?

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Hearsay.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) What in particular did she say to you at this time?

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Hearsay, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) Was she still upset at that time when you were --
when you arrived there at the house?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

And was it your understanding that she was still upset as to something
that had occurred just prior that you remember, that you were called
over there for?

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Calls for speculation; lack of foundation, and
hearsay.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: May I have the question again, sir?

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) Was it your impression that she was still upset
about something that had occurred earlier there that you had come over
there for, Mr. Cowlings?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

Now, once again, can you tell me what you said to her at this time.

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) And can you tell me what she said to you.

MR. LEONARD: Objection; hearsay.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. KELLY: Your Honor, I believe that --

MR. LEONARD: Your Honor, I ask for no speaking objections; if we can
approach side bar.

THE COURT: I sustained the objection.

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) After you were in the kitchen, what, if anything,
did you observe next?

A. That she was upset, she was angry. She didn't talk that much. She
was just kind of like pouting, with herself, and that was about it.

Q. Okay.

And did you see anybody else there in the kitchen at any time, other
than Nicole?

A. I heard some noise coming from the dining room. And as I looked
towards that opening of the door, I saw O.J. step in, into the area
where Nicole and I were.

Q. Was that the first time you had seen him since you arrived there at
Rockingham?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, what, if anything, happened then, when he came into the
kitchen doorway?

A. He said that he wanted --

MR. LEONARD: Objection, Your Honor. Object to the hearsay.

THE COURT: That's overruled.

THE WITNESS: The question again?

Q. I'm sorry.

What, if anything, did Mr. Simpson say and/or do after you observed
him in the kitchen doorway?

A. He wanted to talk to Nicole.

Q. And did he talk to her?

A. She didn't want to hear from him.

Q. She didn't converse with him at that time?

A. No; she didn't want to talk to him.

Q. And what, if anything else, did she do other than indicate she
didn't want to talk to him at this point in time?

MR. LEONARD: Object to any hearsay response at this point; what she
did, not what she did.

THE COURT: What did she do, other than indicate she didn't want to
talk to him at this time?

Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) Did you see her take any actions, also?

A. She picked up the phone.

Q. Did you see her dial a number?

A. No. She told me if he didn't leave, that she was going --

MR. LEONARD: Your Honor, I'd object to the hearsay.

Q. And what, if anything, did Simpson do after Nicole stated that?

at this time.

house and went inside?

A. Alan talking to me.

Q. I'm sorry?

A. Alan talking to me.

Q. Okay.

And you had a conversation with Schwartz?

A. Mostly Alan was talking. I was just listening, 'cause nothing made
sense, 'cause I didn't know at that time what had happened.

Q. And did you then see Mr. Simpson there, also?

A. Yes, I did see him.

Q. Okay.

And first of all, can you describe Mr. Simpson as he appeared to you
when you saw him at that time?

A. Upset, bothered.

of that conversation?

A. Not right at that time.

Q. Well, a short time later, when you're there and still talking to
him?

some stuff that he had taken with him.

Q. What stuff, first of all, that he had taken from Rockingham?

A. Well, the first thing that was brought to my attention through both
parties that was there -- that there was a set of car keys that were
lost.

Q. And whose car keys were those?

A. Those car keys were Alan Schwartz's.

Q. Okay.

And were you told, first of all, where those car keys were lost?

A. It had to be somewhere between the time that he went back to the
house.

Q. What I'm asking, "he" meaning Mr. Simpson?

A. Yes, O.J.

Q. Did Mr. Simpson indicate to you, first of all, where he had lost
Schwartz's car keys?

A. It had to be between where he got out of Alan's car to come back
into the house.

And did he give you some sort of description of the route he had taken
to look for those keys?

A. Yes.

Q. And what did he tell you?

A. The car was parked on Bristol, a block east of O.J.'s house, like
around the corner. His travels took him through his neighbor's yard,
across the tennis court, through a gate, across his tennis court, into
his house.

Q. Did he tell you how he had gotten from the street --

First of all, when you say the neighbor's yard, that's the Von Watts?

A. Yes, Eric Von Watts.

Q. Did he tell you how he got into Von Watts's yard?

A. I don't remember.

Q. Mr. Cowlings, you testified on a prior occasion about these
specific matters?

A. In a case.

Q. On this case, this incident I'm asking about right now. You've
testified on a prior occasion regarding it, have you not?

A. You're talking about the deposition?

Q. Yeah.

A. Yes, I did.

Q. And you were under oath at that time?

A. Yes.

Q. And I asked you -- I asked you questions and you gave me answers?

A. Yes.

Q. And did you remember more about this incident than you do now, Mr.
Cowlings?

A. Somewhat.

Q. Do you recall stating, first of all, that Mr. Simpson told you that
you -- he had jumped over a fence on Ashford to get into the Von
Watts' property and into the backyard?

A. I may have said that.

Q. Would it refresh your recollection to see your prior testimony, Mr.
Cowlings?

A. Probably.

MR. KELLY: If I can have a moment, please, Judge.

(Pause.)

MR. KELLY: 363, 364 -- actually, strike that. 357, lines 12 to 21.

THE COURT: I got "actually, strike that," and nothing else is showing
on the . . .

THE REPORTER: I'll have to check it at a break, Judge.

(Referring to computer screen.)

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) Do you see the monitor there, Mr. Cowlings?

A. Yes.

Q. The first question I asked.

(READING:)

All right okay go on, I'm sorry to interrupt you. This is talking
about what he told you at Von Watts, and your answer is, "So, I said,
well, where did you hide it. He says, well, I know I went over -- no,
no, I take that back, I take that back. Besides the jewelry bag, he
had lost his keys, his car keys, so I said, well, let's back track and
how did you leave, so he -- meaning Simpson, had went over the Von
Watts's wall. And at that time I don't think they had the tennis court
then, so I back tracked, I'm climbing over fences."

Does that refresh your recollection, Mr. Cowlings?

A. Yes.

Q. Do you recall now that Mr. Simpson told you he had gone over the --
the fence between Ashford and the Von Watts' property?

A. When I said over, I probably meant he went over there, on over the
property, not saying that he went over the fence.

MR. KELLY: Steve, can you put on page 360, please. 360, lines 10 to
20.

(Transcript displayed on Elmo.)

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) Starting at line 10. (Reading.)

"Q. Okay. What specific directions did Simpson give you in terms of
finding those keys? "A. It was over a fence. "Q. What fence? "The Von
Watts. "Q. What type of fence was that? "A. Chain link fence -- it
could have been a wooden fence. "Did he indicate to you that he had
climbed over that chain link fence? "A. Yes."

Do you remember being asked those questions and giving those answers?

A. Yes.

MR. KELLY: 363, 364, Steve. Line 21 to 25.

(Transcript displayed on Elmo.)

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) This is a continuous answer starting at 21.
(Reading.) "I looked around there. I continued towards -- he said he
had jumped the wooden fence that runs along Ashford, so I went over --
"Q. Not to his property? "A. No. From the Von Watts. I mean Eric and
Val have a -- there's a brick about 3 feet then it's wood. "Right. "It
goes maybe five foot high, four foot, I don't know exactly. "So I went
to where he approximately said and I looked around the -- on the house
side the yard and I didn't see it, and when I put my hands up to jump
over the fence, I kind of looked down and I saw the keys in the brick
and the grass, right there was two keys."

Do you remember being asked those questions and giving those answers,
Mr. Cowlings?

A. Yes.

Q. Did that refresh your recollection now that Mr. Simpson told you he
had gone over the fence on Ashford of the Von Watts' property?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

Now -- and in fact, when you went back to Rockingham to -- you went
back there to look for a couple items. It was the keys and something
else, was it not?

A. Yes.

Q. And what else was it Mr. Simpson asked you to go back there and
look for?

A. There was a bag of some kind that he had put in a neighbor's
garbage can.

Q. Okay.

And do you recall where that garbage can was located?

A. The house was on Bristol.

Q. And Bristol runs perpendicular to Ashford; is that right?

A. Right.

Q. And how many houses down Bristol was this house from Ashford?

A. It was -- it was up the block, it was north of Ashford.

Q. Okay.

And how many houses from Rockingham was that?

A. No, it wasn't on Rockingham. I said Ashford.

Q. I mean from Ashford?

A. About three blocks up north of Ashford on Bristol.

Q. Okay.

And where had Mr. Simpson told you he had placed this -- this bag that
was in the garbage can?

A. He said about the third house up the block, walked down, walked the
driveway, and as you got to the end of driveway, there was three
garbage cans or -- one garbage can -- that the satchel bag was in one
of the garbage cans.

Q. It was right where he told you to look, in the garbage can?

A. Yes.

Q. Had you already found the keys there also?

A. No, no, I had found the -- looked in the bag first.

Q. And after you had found the bag, how did you proceed back to
Rockingham?

A. I proceeded the way that I came, came that way, still, you know,
looking for the keys.

Q. Okay.

Was that when you went up to the fence along Ashford and went to go
over it?

A. I didn't go over the fence. I walked through the gate they have
there.

Q. Okay.

And then did you go back to the fence where you had been directed by
Mr. Simpson?

A. I went back, I was back tracking 'cause I hadn't found the keys
yet.

Q. And then you found them at the base of the fence on Ashford?

A. After I went back, way back to O.J.'s house, I didn't find them, so
I came back towards the Von Watts and retracked my tracks again, and
when I got back to the outer fence that faced Ashford, I just braced
myself, I lifted myself up on top of the fence, that's when I saw the
keys.

Q. You were getting ready to go over the fence yourself at this time?

A. I didn't know if I was going to go over or not. I just lifted
myself to look along the fence.

Q. You saw them right at the base there?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

Now, after you had recovered both the keys and the bag out of the
trash can, what, if anything, did you do next?

A. I took the items back to Alan Schwartz's house.

Q. Schwartz -- you had Schwartz's keys?

A. Schwartz's car keys, yes -- no, I take that back. I drove Alan's
car back to his house.

Q. Okay.

And you gave him his car and his car keys back at that time?

A. Yes.

Q. And you gave Mr. Simpson the bag?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

And did you have any other conversation with Mr. Simpson at that time?

A. I probably did, but I don't remember --

Q. Okay.

A. -- what was said.

Q. Okay.

By the way, when you were over there and you found the -- located the
keys and the bag in the trash can, did you go into the Rockingham
house at all?

A. No.

Q. Didn't see Nicole at all?

A. No.

Q. Now, after you returned the keys and the bag, what, if anything,
did you do next?

A. I probably stayed at Alan's house for a while.

Q. Did you have occasion to go back to Rockingham after that time?

A. Not at that time, no.

Q. Was there some point that morning after you had been to Schwartz's
you went back to Rockingham?

A. During that morning?

Q. Yeah.

A. I think I called to see how she was doing.

Q. Was there a time you went over that morning, and in fact, she was
feeding the baby in the kitchen there, Mr. Cowlings?

A. No, it wasn't that morning.

Q. When was the next time you were over at Rockingham?

A. Later on that evening.

Q. And it's your testimony as you sit here today, after you returned
the keys and the bag to Schwartz's, you did not go over to Rockingham
at that time?

A. No, I don't think so.

Q. And you didn't testify in April this year, after you returned the
keys and bag to Mr. Simpson, you went back over to Rockingham and saw
Nicole again to check on her?

A. I saw Nicole later on that day. It wasn't that morning.

MR. KELLY: Steve, can I see that for a moment.

If I could have one moment, Judge.

(Pause.)

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) Page 388, line 18. Question from myself to Mr.
Cowlings. (Reading.) "And, Mr. Cowlings, what did you do after leaving
Alan Schwartz's house at that time where you just returned with the
keys and jewelry bag? "A. What did I do once I left Alan's house? "You
did leave, didn't you? "Yes, I did. "Okay. And what did you do next?
"A. I went by the house to see Nicole. "Okay. Did you have any bearing
as to what time it was then? "Still in the morning. I don't know if it
was 8 o'clock, 8:30, I don't know for sure. Somewhere in that time
range, though."

Now, does that refresh your recollection as to whether you went by
that morning after leaving Mr. Schwartz's house, Mr. Cowlings?

A. When I said that in the depo, now I know I didn't go back over
there until later on that day. I didn't go back over there that
morning. I knew -- I remember that I did go, but now I know I went
back later on in the day that day, not in the morning.

Q. And you recall saying also that you went over that morning, that we
wanted to check on her, she was feeding the baby in the kitchen, Mr.
Cowlings?

A. That happened when I went back that afternoon -- I mean later on
that day, she was feeding the baby.

Q. Okay.

And when you testified that you had offered to take her to the
hospital that morning, that never happened?

A. I took her to the hospital that evening.

Q. I understand that. But --

A. No, I did not.

Q. -- Did you see her that morning, offer to take her to the hospital?

A. No, not that morning, sir.

Q. And did you have occasion to look at Nicole's head or forehead that
morning at all?

A. I didn't see Nicole that morning. Only -- at the time I saw her, I
was called over there the first time. The second time I saw Nicole was
when I went back that evening.

Q. So the entire incident you related to me --

MR. KELLY: If I could have a moment, please, Your Honor.

(Pause.)

MR. KELLY: Can I approach the witness, Your Honor.

THE COURT: You may.

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) Mr. Cowlings, I'm going to ask you to read a number
of pages here in your deposition, starting right here, where I put it
up on the Elmo, okay.

If you can take a couple minutes and read all of this here, and I'll
ask you a couple questions.

A. Sure.

(Witness complies, reads transcript.)

MR. BAKER: What did you ask him to read, counsel?

MR. KELLY: Excuse me?

MR. BAKER: Would you tell us what you're asking him to read.

MR. KELLY: I think it was page 390, three pages.

A. Turn the page?

Q. Yeah.

(Witness complies, continues reading.)

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) Now, Mr. Cowlings, does that refresh your
recollection as to a rather substantial amount of testimony you gave
under oath, during your deposition, on April 17 of this year?

A. Yes. What I said then. But what I know now is what wasn't -- what I
meant to say. What I thought -- well, let me slow down.

What I said there, I was -- I had the times wrong. It was later on
that afternoon when I saw her.

Q. Mr. Cowlings, did I not ask you another series of questions about a
return visit that evening where you gave a different -- an entirely
different account of what happened when you saw Nicole that evening
also?

MR. LEONARD: Objection, argumentative.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. May I have the question again?

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) Did you not -- when I asked you another series of
questions at that same deposition regarding a third visit over seeing
Nicole that evening, you described an entirely different scenario
again about observations you made in conversations with Nicole, did
you not?

A. Sir, you asked me was I -- when I was taking her to the hospital. I
didn't take Nicole to the hospital until later on that day. You said
-- you were saying that I took her that morning or suggested I took
her that morning, and I didn't.

Q. I understand that. But when you testified -- did you not at one
time in your deposition testimony indicate that you offered to take
Nicole to the hospital that morning -- evening and she refused?

A. I may have said that at the deposition. Yes, I did say that. But as
I'm telling you now, I didn't see Nicole until later on that afternoon
when I went back over there.

Q. So when you recounted a whole incident about Nicole complaining
about her head hurting, and you looking at her forehead, and what she
told you about how she had hurt her head, and things like that, none
of that happened that morning, Mr. Cowlings?

A. Not that morning, sir.

Q. And even though you testified that it happened about 8:30, in the
conversation you had while she was in the kitchen that morning feeding
the baby, it's now your testimony that never occurred?

A. I'm saying she was feeding the baby later on that day when I saw
her.

Q. Okay.

Mr. Cowlings, Mr. Simpson has always helped you out whenever you
needed it, hasn't he?

A. That's what friends do.

Q. He's lent you money at times, hasn't he?

A. Yes, he has. So I've had to lend him money back too, sure.

Q. Sometimes you paid him back; sometimes you didn't?

A. That's right, sir.

Q. One time he and his friend, Wayne Hughes bought your condominium
from you?

A. No, they didn't buy it. I bought it.

Q. From them?

A. No.

Q. With them?

A. No.

Q. Okay.

You went on trips with Mr. Simpson?

A. Excuse me?

Q. Mr. Simpson take you on trips with him?

A. I've been on trips with O.J., yes.

Q. Okay.

He got you in movies where he was in?

A. Yes, he has.

Q. Okay.

And always took care of you if you needed help?

A. I was able to provide for myself. If I needed something, I could
always go to O.J.

Q. Okay.

And I believe you've testified before that you'd always be there to
help Mr. Simpson if he needed it, always?

A. That's what friends are about, sir.

Q. Okay.

At this time it's your testimony that that visit you earlier testified
to, did not now occur that morning; is that right?

MR. LEONARD: Objection, asked and answered and argumentative.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. Could I have the question again?

Q. This -- your prior testimony in the deposition regarding this --
this visit to Nicole at 8:00, 8:30 in the morning where -- there was
detailed testimony you gave as to the conversation you had with her,
her physical condition, things she had said to you, it's your
testimony now on the stand, that never occurred that morning; is that
correct?

A. Not that morning.

Q. Okay.

Now, did there come a time that Mr. Simpson asked you to drive him
over to Rockingham?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

And you recall when that was, during the course of the day?

A. It was early on in the day. We drove by, and we saw a patrol car
out in front, and we kept going.

Q. Well, let me ask you, you were driving him from Schwartz's house,
were you not?

A. Yes.

Q. And whose car were you in?

A. We were in mine.

Q. Okay.

And did Mr. Simpson give you very specific directions how to get to
Rockingham?

A. We could have went by the house, come up Bristol and came down
Rockingham, coming north to south.

Q. Okay.

Did he or did he not give you specific directions how to drive to his
house because the police were looking for him at that time?

MR. LEONARD: Objection, compound.

A. He could have.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) Well, yes or no, Mr. Cowlings?

A. I said I know I went up Bristol and came down Rockingham, heading
south, towards his house.

Q. Okay.

MR. KELLY: Move that answer be stricken and the witness be instructed
to answer the question, Your Honor.

THE COURT: The answer is stricken.

Read the question for him.

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) Can you tell me once again, did Mr. Simpson give you
a very specific route to take to his -- back -- back to his house at
Rockingham because he told you the police were looking for him?

A. He could have told me --

Q. Would --

A. -- but I don't remember if he did or not.

Q. Well, do you remember testifying under oath at your deposition,
that Mr. Simpson told you the police were looking for him and
instructed you to take a particular route in case they were at his
house?

A. He could have. I told you I came up Bristol, past Ashford, and came
back down Rockingham, so he could have told me.

MR. KELLY: 408, please.

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) Would it refresh your recollection to see your
deposition testimony, sir?

A. Sure.

(Transcript displayed.)

MR. KELLY: Just -- I need my last question before that on 407.

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) (Reading.) "Okay, you drove him back to Rockingham?"
Then your answer: "Yes. We drove and we came up -- and he wanted me to
go -- come up Bristol and come back -- go north on Bristol, turn left,
west, and come south back down Rockingham, about two blocks up. "Q.
Why was that? "A. At that time he was telling me that the police -- he
felt that the police were still looking for him. "Q. Okay. Were you
checking to see if the police were parked in front, is that why you
took that route? "A. When I got there, I realized, yeah, that's the
reason why. "Q. Okay. Did he tell you that? "A. I saw a police car.
"Q. Parked in front? "A. It had pulled -- I don't know if he had just
pulled up or how long he had been there, but it was at the gate of
Rockingham. "Q. What, if anything, did you do when you saw the police
car? "He, meaning Mr. Simpson, asked me to take him back down to
Alan's. "Q. And did you?" Your answer: "Yes."

Do you remember me asking you those questions during your deposition,
Mr. Cowlings, and you giving those answers?

A. Yes.

Q. Does that refresh your recollection now, Mr. Cowlings, as to
whether or not Mr. Simpson told you the police were looking for him
that morning when you were taking him to Rockingham?

A. Yes.

Q. They were looking for him, weren't they, as he had told you?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

And, in fact, you had a conversation with Alan Schwartz about the fact
that the police were looking for Mr. Simpson also, did you not?

MR. LEONARD: Objection, calls for hearsay.

Move to strike.

THE COURT: Sustained. Stricken.

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) Did you have a conversation with both Mr. Simpson
and Mr. Schwartz at Mr. Schwartz's house about how the police were
looking for Mr. Simpson?

MR. LEONARD: Objection, compound and vague.

THE COURT: Sounds like two conversations.

Sustained.

MR. KELLY: Strike the question, Your Honor.

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) Did Mr. Simpson also tell you that when he pulled
out of his own driveway at Rockingham he knew the police were after
him at this time, Mr. Cowlings?

A. That I don't remember, sir.

Q. Did you not, in your deposition testimony, in April, testify that
Mr. Simpson had told you that when he pulled out of Rockingham he knew
the police were after him, he went one direction, they went another,
and he lost them?

A. He could have said that, sir.

Q. I'm going to refresh your recollection.

If I put your testimony up there on the board --

A. Yes, it would help.

Q. Okay.

MR. KELLY: 386, lines 1 through 24.

(Transcript displayed on Elmo.)

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) (Reading.) "Q. Do you recall what you heard
regarding the police? "A. I don't know if the conversation -- who said
the -- It probably came out of O.J.'s mouth, that the police -- He
went -- When he pulled out of his driveway -- I think -- I don't know
how Nicole's -- all I know, he said that the police were coming after
him, he went out of the driveway, he went one way, they went the
other, so he lost them."

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) Do you recall me asking you that question and you
giving that answer, Mr. Cowlings?

A. Yes.

Q. Does that refresh your recollection now as to that conversation?

A. Yes.

Q. And as you sit here today, it's your testimony now, that you only
made two trips over where you saw Nicole that New Year's Day at
Rockingham; is that correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

When was the second time you went over to Rockingham that day where
you saw Nicole, Mr. Cowlings?

A. It was later on that evening.

Q. Which --

A. Early -- early evening.

Q. By the way, did you talk to her during the course of that day?

A. I did call over there.

Q. And did you tell her where you were going to be that day?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

Did she ever call you?

A. No.

Q. Okay.

You called to check on her?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

Now, once again, could you approximate the time you arrived at
Rockingham that evening to see Nicole the second time?

A. Early evening, could have been 5, 6. I don't know exactly.

Q. Okay.

And where was she this time when you saw Nicole?

A. In the kitchen.

Q. And what was she doing at this time you saw her?

A. She was feeding the baby.

Q. Okay.

Do you recall which baby that was at that time?

A. No.

Q. And can you describe Nicole's demeanor, her state at that time when
you were at the house?

A. She was -- she had the baby in her arms, feeding the baby, wasn't
too talkative.

O.J. was with me.

Q. I'm sorry?

Did you say O.J. was with you at the time?

A. Yes, um-hum.

Q. Okay.

A. That was about it.

Q. And was she still upset at that time?

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Leading, asked and answered.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. She could have been, but I mean she wasn't as -- as she was
earlier, earlier that morning.

Q. Well, I showed you testimony from your deposition where you
indicated you had been mistaken about being over there at 8:30; is
that correct?

A. Excuse me. Let me have the question again.

Q. You've changed from your deposition testimony to today, you're now
saying that you never went over there a second time at about 8:30 in
the morning and saw Nicole; is that correct?

A. I'm telling you about the time now that I went over there that
evening.

Q. But is it your testimony that you were mistaken about the time you
went over there to see Nicole again, but all the other answers you
gave are correct in terms of your conversations with Nicole and your
observations and things like that?

A. You were asking me if -- was I over there that afternoon -- early
that morning?

Q. Yeah.

A. And I'm telling you no.

Q. And you never -- Nicole never told you that her forehead hurt that
morning at any time, did she?

A. Not that I could remember.

Q. Never even had a conversation with her about that?

A. Well, eventually I did.

Q. And when was that, Mr. Cowlings?

A. That was that evening.

Q. And it's your testimony you had that conversation with Mr. Simpson
in the kitchen?

A. Mr. Simpson was standing there, yes.

Q. Okay.

And what, if anything, did she say at that time to you?

A. She was saying I --

MR. LEONARD: Objection, hearsay, Your Honor.

MR. KELLY: I'm sorry?

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) What did she say to you at that time, Mr. Cowlings?

A. She was saying her head was hurting.

Q. Okay.

And did you ask her any other reason why her head was hurting at that
time?

A. I don't know if -- if I had asked her or if I just noticed that
where she was saying her head was hurting I could see that there was
swelling.

Q. Well, didn't she also indicate to you that very -- the first time
that there was a particular part on her head, above the hairline, that
her head hurt, Mr. Cowlings?

A. I don't remember saying that, no.

Q. Okay.

And did she ever indicate to you why her head hurt at this time?

MR. LEONARD: Your Honor, I object. Hearsay.

Can I have a continuing objection on a hearsay basis?

THE COURT: Objection is overruled. This appears to be a conversation
where Mr. Simpson was present.

A. I don't remember.

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) Well, do you recall me asking you these questions
about conversations you had with Nicole New Year's Day, 1989, when I
took your deposition in April this year, Mr. Cowlings?

A. There was a lot of things that's happening since then, sir. It's
hard -- if you want to go back to the deposition, let's do that.

Q. Let's do it.

MR. KELLY: Okay. Page 393, Steve.

(Transcript displayed on Elmo.)

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) Starting at page 392.

I will represent to you, Mr. Cowlings, this is when you were in the
kitchen with Nicole.

The is the second time.

(Reading.) "Q. What did you see? "A. It was red. "Q. Was there any
swelling there? "A. I didn't touch it, so I wouldn't know. "Q. Did you
look at it? "A. I looked at it, it was red. "Q. Did you see any
swelling there when you looked at it? "A. No, I didn't. "Q. Did you
see a bump? "A. No. "Q. What happened next? "A. I said okay, she said
yeah, it just hurts, so I said did you want me to take you to the
hospital, and she said no. "Q. Was she having any difficulty speaking
at this time? "A. No. "Q. Did she indicate to you that she had called
a doctor prior to your arrival there? "A. No. "Q. Did she indicate
that she had spoken to the police again? "A. No. "Q. What, if anything
else did you talk about when you were in the kitchen with her at that
point? "A. I can't remember exactly what we talked about. "Q. When you
looked at her forehead did she tell you what had happened to it?"

MR. KELLY: Top of the next page.

(Reading.) "A. I think she said he had pulled her hair. "Q. Other than
pulling her hair, what else did she tell you he had done to her? "A. I
don't remember. "Q. Was that an injury she was showing to you, when
she pointed to her forehead that you came over and looked at? "A. She
just -- When she said her head was hurting she rubbed the spot, I
guess, that was hurting. "Q. Okay. Show me exactly where she rubbed.
"A. I don't remember exactly. I don't know what side of the head that
she rubbed. "Q. What part of her head was it on? "A. Towards, I guess,
up in the area somewhere. "Q. Above the hairline? "A. Yeah. "Q. You
didn't see any bruises below the hairline on her forehead? "A. No."

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) Now, do you remember being asked those questions and
giving those answers, Mr. Cowlings?

A. Yes.

Q. Do you recall now that there was a time Nicole was indicating an
injury she had above her hairline to you?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

You remember her indicating to you then that -- that he, meaning Mr.
Simpson, had pulled her hair?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

Now, did she tell you anything else about how she had been -- why her
head hurt that day, Mr. Cowlings?

A. I don't remember.

Q. Is it not a fact that she told you that Mr. Simpson had hit her,
Mr. Cowlings?

A. She had told me that she was hit, yes.

Q. Mr. Cowlings, did she tell you that Mr. Simpson had hit her early
that morning?

A. Yes, she probably did, yes.

Q. She did tell you that, did she not?

A. Yes.

MR. KELLY: Steve, can I see Exhibit No. 5.

(Exhibit 5 displayed.)

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) Mr. Cowlings, first of all, you recognize who's in
the photograph?

A. Yes.

Q. That's Nicole?

I'm sorry?

A. Yes.

Q. And see the sweatpants she has on in the picture?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

Are those the sweatpants she had on in the kitchen when you were
called over early that morning?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

And you recall them being soiled like that?

A. Yes.

Q. And the jacket that she has on in that picture, is that the jacket
that she had on that early morning when you were called over there?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

MR. KELLY: Steve, can I see Exhibit No. 4.

(Exhibit 4 displayed on Elmo.)

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) That's Nicole again, is it not, Mr. Cowlings?

A. Yes.

Q. Looking at that photograph, do you recall seeing her that morning
when you were talking to her in the kitchen?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, at that time, Mr. Cowlings, do you recall seeing that bruise
over her forehead?

A. Let me have the question again.

Q. That morning when you first arrived there, early morning when you
received a call and rushed right over there and saw Nicole in the
kitchen, that black jacket and the sweatpants, do recall seeing that
bruise over her right eye?

A. No.

Q. Do you recall seeing any bruise on her right cheek?

A. No.

Q. Do you recall seeing scratches?

A. What I saw was redness.

Q. Okay.

See a split lip?

A. No.

Q. Do you see any hand imprints on her neck?

A. No.

Q. Now, that evening when you were in the kitchen, you had occasion to
get a better look at --

THE WITNESS: Excuse me. Can I take some water, please.

THE COURT: Yes.

Q. You all right?

A. I'm fine.

Q. Okay.

MR. KELLY: Steve, could you flip up 5, please.

(Exhibit 5 displayed.)

MR. KELLY: I'm sorry, the one after that, the other picture.

MR. FOSTER: 3?

MR. KELLY: Yeah.

(Exhibit 3 displayed.)

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) Do you recognize Nicole there?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

You don't recall seeing any of those injuries that morning when you
first arrived there?

A. No.

MR. KELLY: Steve, can I see -- can you flip 4 back up there now.

(Exhibit 4 displayed.)

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) Now, Mr. Cowlings, you indicated earlier that you
had testified that Nicole told you that Mr. Simpson had pulled her
hair, then he had hit her.

Now, drawing your attention to this lump over her right eye, do you
recall seeing it that evening when you were in the kitchen with her?

A. Yes.

Q. And in fact, when you saw it that evening it was actually larger
and darker than it appears in that photograph, was it not, Mr.
Cowlings?

A. I don't remember that.

Q. Do you remember me asking you about that at your deposition? I
showed you these photographs.

A. I don't remember. You have to show me.

Q. Okay.

MR. KELLY: Take the photograph off and put page 439 up there.

(Transcript displayed on Elmo.)

MR. KELLY: Move it down a little bit, Steve. Question above that
you're cutting off.

(Reading.) "Q. Would you agree with me now as you look at that
photograph that she has a very large and swollen bruise" --

(Witness raises hand.)

A. I'm sorry. Where are you?

Q. Right there.

(Reading.) "Q. Would you agree with me now as you look at that
photograph" -- and I'll represent to you, Mr. Cowlings, it was the
photograph I just had up there a moment ago -- "that she has a very
large and swollen bruise over her right eye?" "A. Yes, it is. "Q.
Okay. Did you notice that that morning when you went over to
Rockingham? "A. No, I didn't, sir. "Q. Okay. Did you notice that that
night when you took her to the hospital? "A. Yes, I did. "Q. And, in
fact, when you took her to the hospital that night, it was even larger
and darker than it appears in that photograph there, was it not? "A.
It seemed like it was larger. It could have been darker. Like I say,
she didn't have her hair pulled back. But I noticed that it was
swelling. And when she was telling me that she was bothered by a
headache I felt that, you know, it would be wise for her to go to the
hospital because I didn't want her to go to sleep, you know, thinking
that maybe she had a concussion."

Q. (BY MR. KELLY) Do you recall now, Mr. Cowlings, me asking you those
questions and you giving those answers?

A. Yes.

Q. Does that refresh your recollection that --

MR. KELLY: If you could put No. 4 back up on that screen.

(Exhibit 4 displayed.)

Q. As to that knot over her right eye, whether it was even larger and
darker than it appears in the photograph there?

A. It could have been.

Q. And you, in fact, did take her to the hospital that night for fear
she had a concussion, correct, Mr. Cowlings?

A. Yes.

Q. And you stayed there while she was treated at the emergency room?

A. Yes.

Q. And you took her back home that night?

A. Yes.

Q. And you walked her back in the house?

A. Yes.

Q. Stayed there a little bit with her?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

You see Mr. Simpson there at that time?

A. I don't remember.

MR. KELLY: I have no further questions, Your Honor.

THE COURT: 10-minute recess, ladies and gentlemen. Don't talk about
the case. Don't form or express any opinions.

(The jurors resumed their respective seats.)

THE COURT: You may proceed.

CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. LEONARD:

Q. Good afternoon Mr. Cowlings.

A. Good afternoon, sir.

Q. I have a couple questions for you.

You described Nicole Brown Simpson's demeanor when you saw her on
those two occasions on January 1, 1989. Do you remember that in your
direct testimony?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And would you agree with me, sir, that the primary emotion that you
(sic) exhibited in her demeanor was that she was angry? I think you
used the words "pissed off." Is that fair to say?

A. Yes, she was.

MR. KELLY: Objection. Leading, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Leading. Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) And she was angry in the morning, and she was
angry in the evening, when Mr. Simpson was there with you, right?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, in the evening, there was -- there was a discussion about
going to the hospital, right?

A. Yes.

Q. You suggested that Nicole go to the hospital, and at that point,
Mr. Simpson also insisted that she go to the hospital; is that
correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Did Mr. Simpson, at any point that evening, try to prevent Nicole
from going to the hospital?

A. No.

Q. Did he, at any point, suggest to her anything that you should say
to the physicians at the hospital?

MR. KELLY: Objection. Leading.

THE COURT: Leading. Overruled.

THE WITNESS: May I have the question?

THE COURT: Cross-examination.

MR. KELLY: I know.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Did she at any point -- did Mr. Simpson, at any
point, try to prevent Nicole Brown Simpson from going to the hospital?

A. No.

Q. Did he try to inhibit -- did he suggest anything to her that she
should tell the doctors or not tell the doctors?

A. No.

Q. He saw you leave with her, to go to the hospital; is that right?

A. Yes.

MR. LEONARD: Thank you. I don't have any further questions at this
time.

REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. KELLY:

Q. Mr. Cowlings, so we're clear, though, it was you that suggested to
Nicole that you wanted to take her to the hospital, first; is that
right?

A. Yes.

MR. KELLY: I have no further questions.

MR. LEONARD: Just one question at this point.

RECROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. LEONARD:

Q. Nicole seemed reluctant to go to the hospital?

MR. KELLY: Objection. Calls for speculation.

Q. Did she indicate -- did she respond immediately at that point to
your suggestion?

A. First she said no; yes.

Q. And then what happened, Mr. Simpson? [Sic]

Just tell us what happened after that.

A. I asked her again -- I said -- I voiced my concern about maybe she
may have a concussion. Then O.J. suggested that she needed to go, too.

Q. And when he said that, she agreed, correct, to go to the hospital?

A. Yes, yes. I mean not right at that time, but she did finally agree
to go.

MR. LEONARD: Thank you. No further questions.

FURTHER REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. KELLY:

Q. You encouraged her further, after that, to go, also, did you not?

A. Yes, sir.

MR. KELLY: Thank you. I have no further questions.

MR. LEONARD: Nothing further.

THE COURT: You may to step down.

(The witness stood aside.)

MR. LEONARD: If we can reserve to recall this witness in our case,
Your Honor.

THE COURT: You may.

MR. LEONARD: Thank you.

MR. PETROCELLI: Call Jackie Cooper.

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, I think we are to have a motion that we had
filed relative to the next three witnesses.

MR. PETROCELLI: Third one being whom?

MR. BAKER: Donna Estes.

MR. PETROCELLI: Because of schedule problems with the witnesses, my
intention is to call -- and they're all five -- five-minute witnesses:
Jackie Cooper, Donna Estes, and Craig Baumgarten.

THE COURT: Will the attorneys approach the bench.

(The following proceedings were held at the bench, with the reporter.)

(Pause for the Court to read document.)

MR. P. BAKER: Deposition of the defense, two witnesses, Donna Estes
and Jackie Cooper to be called to impeach collateral matters of Mr.
Simpson. These two witnesses were referenced on page 155 through --
155 through 158 of the trial transcript on November 22, 1996 regarding
conversations in Palm Springs and whether or not Nicole's name is
brought up.

If there's any impeachment it would be to a collateral issue. We would
move to not have these witnesses testify. What she going to testify
to.

MR. PETROCELLI: Jackie Cooper, first, will testify that contrary to
Simpson's testimony on the Palm Springs weekend, 12 days or two weeks
before Nicole's murder, he told Cooper that Nicole had broken up with
him, had ended the relationship; he was unhappy about it; and
essentially talked on and on and on about Nicole that day.

And Donna Estes will testify that same day at dinner, Simpson told her
that he had an argument with Paula earlier that day, Paula asked him
do -- you still love Nicole, don't you; Simpson said yes, I do. And
she left. And then went on to discuss Nicole further with Simpson.

All of this is not only relevant directly to our issue of motive, but
also serves to impeach Simpson's testimony to the contrary. They're
both -- each of them is about a five-to ten-minute witness, Your
Honor.

MR. P. BAKER: Your Honor, Jackie, what he just said about Jackie
Cooper doesn't impeach Mr. Simpson at all.

At page 10, the question was asked by Mr. Petrocelli: Do you still
love Nicole? She asked you that, right? I don't recall this. And he
said yes, I do; I always loved Nicole.

That doesn't impeach anything Mr. Cooper said.

Secondly, Mrs. Estes, in terms of -- in terms of Ms. Estes, at pages 7
and 8, Mr. Simpson said, and during the course of the conversation,
I'm sure Nicole's name came up into that conversation.

What he told us doesn't impeach Mr. Simpson at all. It's prejudicial
pursuant to 352. It misleads the jury, if that's impeachment, which it
doesn't.

THE COURT: Overruled.

(The following proceedings were held in open court, in the presence of
the jury.) JACKIE COOPER was called as a witness on behalf of the
Plaintiffs, was duly sworn, and testified as follows:

THE CLERK: You do solemnly swear that the testimony you may give in
the cause now pending before this Court shall be the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

THE WITNESS: I do.

THE CLERK: Sir, if you would, please state and spell your name for the
record.

THE WITNESS: My name is Jackie Cooper, J-A-C-K-I-E C-O-O-P-E-R.

DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q. Good afternoon Mr. Cooper.

A. Hello.

Q. What do you for a living?

A. I'm a tennis professional.

Q. And in June of 1994, what did you do for a living?

Q. And how long have you known Mr. Cowlings?

A. From the same amount of time, 15 years.

Q. Just generally describe to the jury the nature of your relationship
with Mr. Simpson over the years.

MR. P. BAKER: Vague, Judge.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. As a result of me being a tennis pro and a friend of AC, I got to
know O.J.; I got to know his kids; we played tennis together when he
played tennis, and we played golf together when we played golf, and we
did some things socially together.

Q. So you considered him, in June of 1994, to be a friend?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And you believe he considered you to be a friend?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, do you recall being with Mr. Simpson on the weekend of, I
guess it's May 28, May 29, 1994, Memorial Day weekend?

A. Yes.

Q. And when were you with Mr. Simpson on Saturday?

A. We had a 6:00 a.m. tee time, so I was with him in the morning.

Q. Played a round of golf with him?

A. We played 18 holes.

Q. You shared a golf cart with him?

A. Yes.

Q. How long was your time together playing golf?

A. Approximately four hours.

Q. And after golf, did you have occasion to see him at all that day?

A. Yes. We had lunch after golf.

Q. Then after lunch?

A. After lunch, he came to my house to play golf again, to play
another 18 holes, and --

Q. Did you play?

A. I didn't play because I was -- it was hot and I was tired.

Q. And then he went off to do his thing?

A. Yes; he went to play golf.

Q. And did you then have occasion to speak with him after his golf
round in the afternoon?

A. After his round, he called -- he called me.

Q. On the telephone?

A. Yes.

Q. And how long did you speak on the phone?

A. We talked for approximately one hour, if not a little more.

Q. And then, after you got off the phone, were you with him anymore
that evening?

A. Yes. We had dinner together at LaQuinta Hotel.

Q. Just the two of you?

A. No; it was a party of, I would guess, ten people.

Q. Friends of both of yourself?

A. Yes. More friends of his than mine.

Q. Okay.

Now, so you spent a goodly amount of time with Mr. Simpson that day?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. Okay.

Now, going back to the morning when you played golf with him, did he
talk to you at all about Nicole?

A. Yes, he did.

Q. What did he say?

A. He said that she had broken up with him and it was different this
time; that it was final; that she had -- he told me that she really
meant it this time, I guess. Maybe not verbatim; that's the message
that I got.

Q. And what was his --

MR. P. BAKER: Move to strike as nonresponsive.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) What reaction did Mr. Simpson express to you,
to Nicole having broken off the relationship?

A. I think that he was sad. I think that he was upset and in distress.

MR. P. BAKER: Move to strike as nonresponsive.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) How did he indicate being upset and distressed
to you?

A. I think by -- maybe that he was repetitive in talking about it a
lot.

Q. Did you try to talk him out of it, sir?

A. Talk him out of what?

Q. Did you try to talk him out of his feelings or change his feelings
in any way?

A. I felt for him, and I tried to help him -- my advice to him was to
go on with his life.

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, I move to strike. It's nonresponsive,
irrelevant, and immaterial.

THE COURT: It's stricken.

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Did he basically talk to you about Nicole
pretty much the entire golf round?

MR. BAKER: I object. That's leading.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) What did he mainly talk to you about for the
four hours that you were playing golf?

A. I think off and on, it came up a lot about Nicole.

Q. By the way, was he there with a date that weekend?

A. Yes.

Q. And who was that?

A. Paula.

Q. When you spoke to him between 6:00 and 7:00 in the evening before
dinner -- you said he called you?

A. Yes.

Q. And in the course of that hour, what did he talk about?

A. The first thing he told me is that Paula had gone back home, and
then we talked about Nicole.

Q. For the hour?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

MR. PETROCELLI: No further questions, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Cross.

CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. BAKER:

Q. Mr. Cooper, you were interviewed on November 3, 1994 by the LAPD,
right?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. Never mentioned one thing about the 18 holes of golf, correct?

A. I don't recall.

Q. Never mention one thing about the hour-long phone call you
testified to here?

A. I don't recall.

Q. Never mentioned one thing about any conversation whatsoever
concerning Nicole Brown Simpson, right?

MR. PETROCELLI: Your Honor, I'm going to object only because there's
no foundation that he was asked these questions.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Wait a minute. When you were interviewed by the LAPD
in November of 1994, it was about the murder of Nicole Brown Simpson
and Ron Goldman, by the Police Department and the LA D.A.'s office;
isn't that true?

A. It was a telephone call.

Q. Maybe you didn't understand the question.

You were interviewed on November 3, 1994, about the murders and your
relationship with O.J. Simpson; you knew it was concerning the murder
of Nicole Brown Simpson when you gave the interview. Isn't that true,
Mr. Cooper?

A. They called me because they found my telephone number.

Q. Did you or did you not know that it was about the murder of Nicole
Brown Simpson?

Can you simply answer the question?

A. Yes.

Q. And in that interview, you never mentioned her name once, did you?

MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. He doesn't know what he was asked.

A. I don't -- I have no idea what I did or not.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) What you told the investigating officers was that
Jackie Cooper recalls the weekend as being enjoyable golf and tennis,
correct?

A. I would classify doing that as enjoyable.

Q. Well, I would, too, if I had your job.

But you never mentioned one thing about Mr. Simpson having had what
you now talk about as the discussion centering around Nicole Brown
Simpson; isn't that true, sir?

A. I recall only one question that they asked me.

Q. Maybe you didn't understand my question.

My question, sir, is: You didn't mention one thing about any
conversation you had with Mr. Simpson concerning Nicole Brown Simpson;
true or untrue?

MR. PETROCELLI: I'm going to object on the ground that it's
argumentative and also lacks foundation, in that has not elicited what
he was asked.

THE COURT: Overruled.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) True?

A. Would you repeat the question, please.

Q. You never once mentioned the name Nicole Brown Simpson in this
purported conversation that went four hours on the golf course, an
hour on the telephone, and another time period after that. You never
once mentioned that to the investigating officers, did you, sir?

A. I don't know if I did or not.

Q. You looked-- you spent some time with Mr. Petrocelli relative to
this case, did you not, sir?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. You looked at the statement you gave to the police back in 1994?

A. No, sir.

Q. Never looked at it?

A. No, sir.

Q. Did you -- did you recall, sir, the members of the foursome?

A. Alan Austin was one, and relatives of Alan Austin, and I don't -- I
actually don't even know their names right now.

Q. They were Alan Austin and relatives of Alan Austin and yourself,
correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And Mr. Simpson, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And so it was a fivesome?

A. No, it was a foursome.

Q. How could there be relatives of Alan Austin if it was a foursome?

A. Well, a relative.

Q. And now you have all these remembrances of these conversations
about this evening with Mr. Simpson and the day with Mr. Simpson,
right?

A. Yes, I do.

Q. Yeah.

And that's after you spent how much time with Mr. Petrocelli?

A. I would guess -- I would say -- estimate 20 minutes with Mr.
Petrocelli.

Q. How about the rest of them?

A. None.

Q. How about when you were first contacted about this?

A. It was last spring.

Q. And from last spring to the present, you've spent 20 minutes total,
right?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. Yeah, I see.

And you never felt compelled to -- during the criminal trial, to ever
discuss one thing with the police about these purported conversations
you're here telling the jury about, correct?

MR. PETROCELLI: That's argumentative, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) Well, you never did, after you were contacted on
November 4, 1995 -- strike that -- November 3, 1994 -- you never did
contact the police with this -- these comments that you say that Mr.
Simpson was talking about Nicole Brown Simpson?

A. No, I did not.

Q. You stated in your interview that O.J. was with Paula Barbieri. You
told them that, did you not?

A. Did I tell who that?

Q. The police, when they talked to you, November 3, 1994.

A. If they asked me about it, I -- whatever they asked me, I told them
the truth.

Q. I see.

And you don't have an explanation as to why Nicole Brown Simpson's
name was never brought up in your interview with the police on
November 3, 1994, correct?

MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. Calls for speculation, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

THE WITNESS: Would you repeat it.

Q. (BY MR. BAKER) You have no explanation when you were called on
November 3, 1994, to talk about Mr. Simpson and the weekend that you
have just discussed with this jury, why there was not one mention of
any conversation with Mr. Simpson where Nicole Brown Simpson's name
was mentioned, correct?

A. That's right. I felt that they were in control of the conversation.
And it was very brief.

Q. I see.

So, in any event, sir, you didn't tell them anything about any
conversation you had -- you purportedly had with Simpson concerning
Nicole Brown Simpson; true or untrue?

MR. PETROCELLI: Asked and answered.

A. I'm not sure.

THE COURT: Sustained.

MR. BAKER: Nothing further.

REDIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q. Did you just answer the questions they posed to you?

A. Yes, sir. Yes, I did.

MR. BAKER: Leading and suggestive.

THE COURT: Overruled.

MR. PETROCELLI: No further questions.

THE COURT: You may step down.

Next witness.

MR. PETROCELLI: Donna Estes.

DONNA ESTES, called as a witness on behalf of Plaintiffs, was duly
sworn and testified as follows:

THE CLERK: You do solemnly swear that the testimony you may give in
the cause now pending before this court shall be the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

THE WITNESS: I do.

THE CLERK: Please be seated. And if you would, please state and spell
your name.

THE WITNESS: Donna Estes, D-O-N-N-A, E-S-T-E-S.

DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q. Good afternoon, Mrs. Estes. As of June 12, 1994, did you know O.J.
Simpson?

A. Yes.

Q. And how long had you known him?

A. I met them in 1988.

Q. When you say you met "them," you referring to O.J. Simpson and
Nicole?

A. O.J. and Nicole.

Q. And what was the nature of your relationship with Mr. Simpson and
Nicole from 1988 to 1994?

A. Social acquaintances. Maybe a little more. I was quite friendly
with Nicole and both O.J.

Q. Did you ever go on any trips with them out of town?

A. We went to Acapulco for Nicole's 30th birthday in 1989.

Q. How many people went on that trip?

A. It was O.J. and Nicole and two other couples, including me.

Q. And that was Nicole's 30th birthday, you say?

A. Right.

Q. Okay.

Were you with Mr. Simpson on the weekend of May 28, May 29, 1994,
Memorial Day weekend?

A. Yes, I was.

Q. Was that at LaQuinta?

A. Yes.

Q. Why were you there?

A. It was a group of friends went down to celebrate someone's
birthday, so we went down for a long weekend.

Q. Is that the birthday of Gail Austin?

A. Yes.

Q. Alan --

A. Alan Austin's wife.

Q. Alan Austin. And Alan Austin is a mutual friend of yours and Mr.
Simpson?

A. Right.

Q. You saw Mr. Simpson at dinner that night?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

And how many folks were seated around the table, approximately?

A. Approximately 10.

Q. It was in a restaurant in LaQuinta?

A. Right.

Q. And at some point, Mr. Simpson joined the table?

A. Yes. He came to the table. Everyone was seated, and O.J. came in.
He came in late. And he came in without Paula Barbieri, who had come
down to the resort with him. I had seen them in the morning and they
said, we'll see you at dinner. When dinner came, O.J. came in alone.

Q. What did Mr. Simpson say to you when he sat down?

A. He sat down next to me and he explained that he and Paula had got
into a fight because Paula asked him if he was still in love with
Nicole, and he said yes, he was. And she left.

Q. Did he say anything more about Paula the remainder of the evening?

A. He really didn't talk very much about Paula. He spent quite a bit
of time speaking of Nicole. In fact, for maybe 20 minutes, he just
continued talking about Nicole.

Q. And what did he say about Nicole, if you can remember?

A. He was saying things like how lucky he was that she was such a good
mother to his children, and that the best day he can think of would be
going to Disneyland with Nicole and the two children.

He also talked about Nicole liking to go out dancing, and that Nicole
would rather go out dancing and wearing short skirts and see who
notices her, than to just spend a quiet evening at home.

Q. And is it fair to say he expressed both displeasure and good
feelings about her?

A. Oh, yes.

Q. After that evening, did you then run into Mr. Simpson a few lights
nights later?

A. Yes, I saw him at the House of Blues.

Q. What is the House of Blues?

A. The House of Blues is a -- it's sort of a nightclub that plays live
music, and they were having -- it's dinner and music -- they were
having dinner outside, and I was having dinner with another couple,
and we were all friends, so we joined his bigger party later in the
evening.

Q. And did Mr. Simpson say anything to you that evening?

A. When I joined them at the table, I sat down for a few minutes next
to Paula, who had -- who showed me a bracelet that O.J. had just given
her. And at one point, O.J. got up and left the table, and came by and
just mentioned to me, don't say anything to Nicole about the bracelet
or about Palm Springs.

MR. PETROCELLI: No further questions.

THE COURT: Cross.

CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. BAKER:

Q. What was the date on this purported House of Blues meeting?

A. It would have been the Wednesday -- I believe the Wednesday after
Memorial Day weekend.

Q. And was that the one up on Sunset?

A. Yes.

Q. Okay.

Now, you were over across at Mr. Petrocelli's suite at the Doubletree?

A. Yes. I came there just before I came here.

Q. And how long did you meet with him?

A. I was only there for a few minutes. I didn't actually get there
until, like, almost 1:20, and we came straight here.

Q. All right.

Now, you told us that you met O.J. and Paula Barbieri on the morning
-- that Saturday morning?

A. Right.

Q. And you chatted with them about that time. What time was that?

A. You know, it's hard to remember what time. I just remember it was
in the morning, because we were planning the day. So, I mean, I can
guess. I have no idea. Maybe 10 o'clock, but that's just a guess.

Q. All right.

And -- and you say you had a discussion with him at that time,
correct?

A. Everyone just agreed to meet for dinner that night, and there was
discussion of who was going to do what during the day.

Q. And was -- was it your understanding, when you say you agreed to
meet in the morning, when you talked to Paula and O.J., that there had
been no plans about meeting that night at the dinner, as far as you
were aware?

A. I don't really understand what you're asking me.

Q. Are you telling us that when you say you had this happenstance
meeting with Paula and O.J. in the morning of -- Saturday morning,
that there was no premade plans to have dinner on Saturday night?

A. We had all planned on having dinner on Saturday night. That was the
plan. Everyone went down together. And the discussion was what were
people going to do during the day. And we were all going to meet for
dinner in the evening.

Q. Okay.

And is it -- well, in terms of the sitting at the table, did you sit
next to O.J. Simpson?

A. I sat next to O.J. for maybe 20 or 25 minutes. My husband was at
the other end of the table, and then he came and sat next to O.J. for
the rest of the dinner.

Q. And they talked about your -- you and O.J. talked about your
relationship, did you not?

A. My relationship?

Q. Yeah, with your husband. You were talking about the relationships
that the men and women had --

A. No.

Q. -- at the table, were you not?

A. No, we weren't, actually.

Q. You didn't talk about that at all?

A. No. My relationship with my husband, no.

In fact, he wasn't my husband at the time. And I very specifically
remember not talking about it because he came in late, and we jumped
right into the discussion as to why he was late.

Q. And the only thing that you recall in the conversation that was
discussed within the 20, 25 minutes that you talked to Mr. Simpson,
was about Nicole, and that she was a good mother, and he would -- his
idea of a good day was going to Disneyland with her and the kids?

A. Yeah. And how Paula didn't understand that.

Q. And he also talked to you about his dislike for Nicole's going-out
spots, drinking, with short skirts and seeing how she was noticed,
correct?

A. Yes.

Q. I don't have anything further.

MR. PETROCELLI: Nothing, Your Honor.

THE COURT: You may step down.

THE WITNESS: Thank you.

MR. PETROCELLI: Craig Baumgarten.

CRAIG BAUMGARTEN, called as a witness on behalf of Plaintiffs, was
duly sworn and testified as follows:

THE CLERK: You do solemnly swear that the testimony you may give in
the cause now pending before this court shall be the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

THE WITNESS: I do.

THE CLERK: Thank you.

And, sir, would you please state and spell your name for the record.

THE WITNESS: Craig Baumgarten. First name, C-R-A-I-G, Baumgarten,
B-A-U-M-G-A-R-T-E-N.

DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. PETROCELLI:

Q. Good afternoon Mr. Baumgarten?

A. Good afternoon.

Q. You are a friend of Mr. Simpson?

A. Yes.

Q. And you interact with him on a regular basis, right?

A. Yeah.

Q. How long have you known him?

A. I think about eight years.

Q. And in 1994, you were a regular golf partner of his, right?

A. That's correct.

Q. And you played golf with him and several other folks on the morning
of June 12, 1994, Sunday morning, right?

A. Yes, sir.

Q. And on that occasion, Mr. Simpson told you some things about Paula
Barbieri, did he not?

A. We discussed a number of things. Yes.

Q. What did he say in regard to Paula Barbieri, if you can recall?

A. At one point during the -- during the round, we had a conversation
concerning the fact that Paula was upset, that O.J. felt it best she
not join him at the recital that afternoon at Sydney's recital. And --
Yeah.

Q. Mr. Simpson reported to you that he had -- he was with Paula the
night before?

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Leading.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Was Mr. Simpson relating a conversation to you
that he had had with Paula?

A. I don't know at what point that conversation between Mr. Simpson
and Paula occurred. It was my own knowledge that he had been with her
that evening -- the previous evening.

Q. And what did, again, he say that Paula was upset about?

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Asked and answered and leading.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. He said that she wanted to go to the recital.

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Did Mr. Simpson indicate whether or not he told
Paula she could go to the recital?

A. He felt it inappropriate. And he was discussing with me 'cause I
had had similar situations many years earlier when I had been
divorced, and I -- the woman I was involved with, and, you know, you
just get in those situations sometimes when you have small children,
going through a divorce, and you have other relationships.

Q. Just to be clear in this, what did Mr. Simpson tell you he had said
to Paula about her not going to the recital?

A. I don't know his words. He reported to me that he felt it
inappropriate that she join him at that recital.

Q. Based on what Mr. Simpson told you about Paula being upset, when
you left the golf course that day, did you have the state of mind that
Paula was extremely upset?

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Irrelevant, Your Honor, his state of mind.

THE COURT: Paula's state of mind.

MR. LEONARD: No, his state of mind. That was the question.

THE COURT: I don't think that was the question.

MR. PETROCELLI: It's foundational to the next question, Your Honor.

MR. LEONARD: I object on relevance to Paula.

THE COURT: Paula's state of mind. Sustained.

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) When you heard of Nicole's murder was sometime
on the 13th of June, right?

A. Yes.

Q. And at the time, you formed the opinion that Paula might have had
something to do with it, correct?

MR. LEONARD: Objection.

THE COURT: Sustained.

Jury to disregard the question.

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Did you have the belief, based on your
conversations with Mr. Simpson --

MR. LEONARD: I'm going to object and ask to approach.

THE COURT: Approach the bench.

(The following proceedings were held at the bench, with the reporter.)

MR. LEONARD: On the record, I want an offer of proof at this point.
This question is what belief this witness formed based on the previous
ten questions. I want an offer of proof at this point.

MR. PETROCELLI: This witness, first of all, is extremely friendly to
Mr. Simpson. I would request that he be treated hostilely under
Section 767, so I can lead him.

In any event, this witness will testify that Mr. Simpson told him that
Paula was so upset about this recital, that when he heard of Nicole's
murder, he thought Paula had something to do with it because she was
so "pissed off," to use his words.

THE COURT: I'll sustain the objection. His state of mind has nothing
to do with his opinion.

MR. PETROCELLI: It goes to his report of Simpson's conversation, Your
Honor.

THE COURT: You --

MR. PETROCELLI: May I lead?

THE COURT: You may inquire as to what Simpson's conversation was, but
the rest of it, I don't think is relevant.

MR. PETROCELLI: Can I lead him?

MR. LEONARD: He asked about the conversation twice now.

MR. BAKER: He's been to his suite.

MR. PETROCELLI: He's never been to my suite.

MR. LEONARD: He's asked him twice.

THE COURT: Go ahead and lead him on that issue.

(The following proceedings were held in open court, in the presence of
the jury.)

Q. (BY MR. PETROCELLI) Mr. Baumgarten, isn't it true that Mr. Simpson
told you that -- Sunday morning, that Paula was extremely upset with
him?

Isn't that true?

MR. LEONARD: Asked and answered.

THE COURT: Overruled.

A. I don't know if "extremely" ever been used. Paula was upset, that
was my understanding, about the recital.

Q. It was your understanding based on what Mr. Simpson told you,
correct?

A. Yes.

I have no other knowledge.

Q. You're talking about what 6:00, 7:00 in the morning on June 12,
right?

A. My recollection is, it was later in the round, I think, but it was
in the morning.

Q. Okay.

Now, you also had a near confrontation with Mr. Simpson on the golf
course that morning, right?

A. We had an argument.

Q. And, in fact, you got -- it got a little heated, right?

A. It's fair to say.

Q. And it's also fair to say that the two of you sort of, at one
moment in the heated argument, squared off, right, face to face?

MR. LEONARD: Objection. Vague.

THE COURT: It's not vague.

Overruled.

A. We faced each other. "Squared off" implies something that I -- that
I don't believe.

Q. You faced each other in sort of a heated -- a moment of heated
argument, right?

A. We had a heated argument.

Q. It was about a golf shot, right?

A. That's -- yeah, yes.

Q. And isn't it fair to say that you had never before seen Mr. Simpson
that angry?

A. Mr. Simpson was very angry, and so was I.

Q. The question was, you had never before seen him that angry as he
was when you had that heated argument with him?

A. I don't recall seeing Mr. Simpson that angry.

Q. You don't recall having seen him that angry on any other occasion,
correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And isn't it also true, sir, that on that day, in that golf round,
Mr. Simpson told you that it was over for good between Nicole and him?

A. No, that's not true.

Q. He didn't say that at all to you, sir?

A. No, sir. He -- if you want, I will put it --

Q. Please.

A. -- in my own words.

Q. Yeah, put it in your own words.

A. He said to me that he recognized that for now, he and Nicole
couldn't be together. And the words that I remember precisely was that
maybe in five years, at some point in the future, he hoped they could
put it back together.

MR. PETROCELLI: Thank you. No further questions.

CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. LEONARD:

Q. This -- good afternoon. I'm sorry.

This "squaring off," as Mr. Petrocelli put it, you've had similar
confrontations with Mr. Simpson in the past, correct, over -- let me
ask you this: This all started with something that occurs once in a
while in golf; that is, Mr. Simpson -- actually, you moved behind Mr.
Simpson when he was trying to take a toe shot?

A. Actually, Mr. Simpson moved behind me while I was taking a toe
shot. I got upset with Mr. Simpson is how it began.

There were maybe instances in the history of our golf game of five
guys who play together every weekend, over numerous years, where
various people in that game got upset over various incidences [sic],
and they never lasted very long. And neither did this.

Q. For the -- for the golf neophytes, people who don't know about it,
just explain why that's so disconcerting to have somebody walked
behind you while you're swinging.

A. It's distracting when you're trying to move this little white ball
with a club head.

Q. It's hard enough?

A. Yes.

Q. You kissed and made up shortly after that?

A. I don't believe we kissed.

Q. You hugged, right?

A. We actually did hug five minutes later, yes.

Q. All right.

Now, you were asked some questions about discussions about Paula. In
fact, you saw Mr. Simpson trying to reach Paula. At some point, he was
trying to phone her?

A. I have no idea who he was trying to phone. He was using the phone
when we got off the golf course, trying to reach somebody.

Q. His demeanor at this point, he was laughing and having fun?

MR. PETROCELLI: Objection. Leading.

THE COURT: I'll sustain that.

MR. LEONARD: Leading?

MR. PETROCELLI: Yes, leading.

THE COURT: I think he's an adverse witness.

Q. (BY MR. LEONARD) Can you describe for us his demeanor when you saw
him making a phone call?

A. His demeanor at the time, as soon as the argument was over, it was
a normal day, as far as I could --

Q. Okay.

He also -- you -- Mr. Petrocelli also asked you about some discussion
about Nicole. And would you describe, if you can, his demeanor at that
point. In other words, whether he was angry or resentful, resigned.
How would you describe it?

A. He had no anger or resentment. There was a sadness, is how I
believe I'd describe it.

MR. LEONARD: I have no further questions. Thank you. Appreciate it.

MR. PETROCELLI: Nothing, Your Honor.

THE COURT: You may step down.

MR. GELBLUM: Nancy Ney, Your Honor.

MR. BAKER: What?

MR. GELBLUM: Nancy Ney.

MR. BAKER: Your Honor, I want to approach.

MR. GELBLUM: I thought you weren't going to object on that, Bob.

THE COURT: Isn't that the first ruling I made this morning?

MR. P. BAKER: That was about a document.

MR. BAKER: That was about a document.

THE COURT: Okay. Come up.

(The following proceedings were held at the bench, with the reporter.)

MR. P. BAKER: On Nancy Ney, two issues.

First of all, Nancy Ney was never listed as a witness on their witness
list. It was filed in the joint statement, the amended joint
statement, pages 5 to 6. There's no mention of Nancy Ney. And the
first time we had notice that they were going to call her was last
Friday. So, pursuant to local rules we got in witness statements she
was never listed.

Secondly, Ms. Ney is the lady who is going to testify as to having a
phone call, it's my understanding, from a person named Nicole, who
doesn't identify herself as Nicole Brown Simpson, saying that she was
being battered and questioning whether she should return to the
battering spouse.

It doesn't mention it's Nicole Brown Simpson. And I think the case
which we relied upon, the case cites the Court in People versus Arcega
1982 32 Cal.3d and People versus Ireland, have clearly held that it's
reversible error to withhold hearsay statements of homicide victims
expressing fear of the defendant, even when made on the very day of
the homicide.

That's what this statement is about, number one. It's not even that
good because they don't even have this Nicole Brown Simpson; they have
it as an unidentified person saying that her name is Nicole.

MR. GELBLUM: Your Honor, it comes in the hearsay. First, the state of
mind exception the state of mind. We've been over this several times.
Her state of mind is clearly relevant. It's all about the state of
mind five days before the murders. They are extreme fear Mr. Simpson
phone calls.

In terms of identifying her as Nicole Brown Simpson, as Nicole -- she
said Nicole. And I have a lot of identifying characteristics: Age, in
30s, married to a high profile man, married for eight years, two
children, boy and a girl under 10 years old, lives in West LA,
Caucasian, police had been called 8 times. All of these things match
exactly with Nicole Brown Simpson.

This -- there's really no doubt at all this is Nicole Brown Simpson.

Plus, she will testify that she heard recordings of the 911 call and
the voice she heard on the phone is consistent with the voice on the
-- very, very high probability this is Nicole Brown Simpson.

MR. PETROCELLI: Plus, Simpson's testimony.

MR. P. BAKER: High probability? They can't identify it as Nicole Brown
Simpson. It's hearsay. Mr. Simpson is not in the room when this call
is made. Under 352, this has got to be excluded.

MR. GELBLUM: It's your crucial testimony. This one woman is saying
things that match up precisely with Nicole's situation with Mr.
Simpson corroborate with other witnesses. As soon as she heard about
the witnesses -- as soon as Ms. Ney heard about the murders, she said
it that sounds familiar. I looked through my records. She went back
and looked and said that's got to be the same person. All the
identifying characteristics identify it.

THE COURT: What about the cases that counsel cites?

MR. GELBLUM: That's hearsay in those cases. They don't have the
state-of-mind exception.

THE COURT: This is hearsay.

MR. GELBLUM: It's an exception, state of mind.

THE COURT: What state of mind?

MR. GELBLUM: Nicole's state of mind, fear for -- from Mr. Simpson.

THE COURT: What is the state of mind in these cases?

MR. GELBLUM: I don't know. I can only assume it wasn't raised. They
said it's hearsay.

THE COURT: You can what do you mean you can only assume good.

MR. GELBLUM: Your Honor we got this this morning. I got this this
morning. If you want us to brief it, we'll brief it. I haven't had a
chance to read these. They don't have any representation state of
mind, there was any exception to the state of mind.

THE COURT: You better brief it.

MR. GELBLUM: Okay. Call another witness.

MR. GELBLUM: Tomorrow morning.

THE COURT: Okay.

MR. GELBLUM: On those two cases.

(The following proceedings were held in open court, in the presence of
the jury.)

MR. PETROCELLI: Last live witness. We'll play a video for you for
about 20 minutes.

THE COURT: Okay.

(The following proceedings were held in open court in the presence of
the jury.)

MR. PETROCELLI: Mrs. Ney will be deferred until tomorrow morning.

We'll begin with playing about 20 minutes of the deposition of Frank
Olson, Chairman of Hertz Corporation, taken in this case sometime in
the spring.

MR. LEONARD: And there's going to be a very brief reading of some
additional portions, as we did with one of the other depositions.

MR. PETROCELLI: Okay.

(The videotaped deposition of Frank Olson was played in open court,
and was not reported.)

MR. PETROCELLI: Okay, stop it.

There's about five or ten minutes left, Your Honor. We'll do it in the
morning.

THE COURT: Okay.

MR. PETROCELLI: Thank you.

THE COURT: Ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow at 8:30, we have another
matter unrelated to this case, so I'm going excuse you until 9 o'clock
tomorrow.

Don't talk about the case. Don't form or express any opinions.

Counsel is to be here at 8:30.

Let me see counsel at side bench.

(A bench conference was held among Court and counsel, which was not
reported.)

(At 4:30 P.M., an adjournment was taken until Wednesday, December 4,
1996, at 9:00 A.M.)

<A NAME="1"><b>What is a family business?</b></A><BR>
(<A HREF="#contents">Back to Contents</A>)<p>
People differ as to how they define family businesses. We define them as businesses controlled by family members or a family member and which employs one or more family members. They are privately-held and notwithstanding their ownership, can be very large and very profitable. <p>

It has been estimated that there are  more than 12 million U.S. family businesses which account for more than half of the U.S. gross domestic product. <p>

<A NAME="2"><b>Are the legal needs of family businesses different from those of any other business?</b></A><BR>
(<A HREF="#contents">Back to Contents</A>)<p>
Yes and no. A family business is still a business. They have the same problems that all businesses experience-- competition, financing, profitability, understanding a worldwide economy and its impact on businesses of any size, labor and resources and others unique to  them. That's why a good family business lawyer must first be a good business lawyer.<p>

Because family businesses rely heavily on family members for key officer positions, they have fewer problems, if things are running well, with loyalty, management and strategic planning. The key point is "if things are running well." If they are not, everything breaks down at once, the family and the business. Family businesses are like the little girl in the nursery rhyme, "when she was good she was very, very good and when she was bad she was horrid."<p>

Unfortunately, unlike most other businesses, family businesses typically avoid formalizing their management and transition plans. Because of this, the biggest problems faced by family businesses include transition and estate planning, and disputes over management styles and ownership. Sometimes these problems are aggravated by multi-generational issues, such as marriage and divorce of off-spring (or increasingly, divorces and remarriage of the parent(s) who run the business). Sometimes the remarriage or divorce of the family business leader or his or her death or disability can cripple a business beyond repair. <p>

A good family business lawyer needs to understand this, and be able to deal with the multitude of legal issues which develop from these intermingled and often conflicting business and personal relationships. <p>

Just think about the problems and confusion which could result from a younger daughter, who is running the family business, having to tell her father that customers have complained about his responsiveness, or telling her mother that the financials she prepared don't comply with the bank's request. Or what about the wife who feels her husband is carrying the weight of the family business without sufficient recognition and compensation? This gives you just a taste of the kind of confusing  interaction that occurs daily in a family business. There's always a confusion of roles: are you the family member (within a defined pecking order) or the employee-manager-owner (within another defined pecking order)?<p>

These problems are multiplied when the younger generation marries. Often, even if the siblings have worked out their roles satisfactorily, now new members to the family are providing input, and often criticism. Daughters-in-law and sons-in-law  are frequently the cause of family
business breakups. In addition, the family often brings these spouses into the business. Upon divorce of the family member, the former spouse-employee often asserts a claim to a portion of the business. Even when that doesn't happen, the former spouse is most likely out of a job, which certainly hurts that individual and probably the business as well. <p>

<A NAME="3"><b>How else are family businesses different from their counterparts?</b></A><BR>
(<A HREF="#contents">Back to Contents</A>)<p>

The Mass Mutual survey of more than 1,000 family-owned businesses discloses some interesting information about family businesses.<p>

The persons responding to the survey indicated that male relatives are more likely than female relatives to be involved in the family businesses, to hold more influential positions, and to be identified as the key decision-makers for the business. Results disclosed that sons are four times as likely as daughters to be identified by owners as controlling ownership and governance decisions in the next generation.<p>

It is also interesting to note that approximately two-thirds of the people who own family businesses were raised in families that owned a business, and three-quarters of all owners with children said they would encourage their kids to follow in their footsteps. <p>

Family businesses are regularly managed differently from their non-family counterparts as well. Decisions on key issues are made by a small number of people who come to their decisions through consensus. However, most owners feel the key decision makers in the business trust one another, but are less certain they share goals or achieve what they set out to accomplish. (This is a prime reason for careful and clear documentation and advance planning for the business transition and management.)<p>

Finally, the survey results how that family businesses focus on long-term goals, and not on growth for growth's sake. Value and profitability consistently, throughout the years the survey has been conducted, stand out as the top priorities of family business owners, while growth once again ranked considerably lower among financial considerations.<p>

More information about the survey can be obtained from <a href=http://www.mass.mutual.com/familt2.html>Mass Mutual's website</a>.<p>

<A NAME="4"><b>What can family businesses do to protect themselves against family members (or their ex-spouses) trying to destroy the business?</b></A><BR>
(<A HREF="#contents">Back to Contents</A>)<p>

<b> Open and Frequent Communication: </B> Careful planning can prevent most family business problems. Most often the problem arises because people within the family have different expectations, and understandings. This is more of a communication problem, than a business one. Regular meetings in which each family member can share their viewpoint and concerns can often minimize such miscommunications. It is key that all members feel their input is welcome.<p>

<b> Clarify the Succession of Control of the Business Early:</b>  It is also key that they understand their role in the succession of the business. A disgruntled son or daughter may feel that they, not their sibling, should have received controlling interest in the business. This leads to family dissension and frequently to litigation. Even if the succession is upheld, the cost (both economically and emotionally) to the business may be exorbitant.<p>

Although inheritance rights are governed by state laws, and differ from state to state, generally offspring have no right to inherit from their parents. Rarely would a child be able to overturn a parent's specific bequest in this way. Unfortunately, the offspring may not be seeing things clearly, and acting purely out of emotion. It is much better to face this while all parties are still alive, letting people know where they stand, rather than learning this for the first time through a cold document reaching from the grave. Any estate planning documentation must work along with the shareholders agreement, and a qualified lawyer must consulted when they are prepared.<p>

<b>Documentation:</b>  Documenting the understandings also helps define the expectations of the parties. The agreements most helpful to family businesses generally are employment agreements for family member employees and shareholders agreements (assuming the business is incorporated, or the operating agreement, as to limited liability companies, or partnership agreements, as to partnerships) to define the inter-relationship of the shareholders, and their rights upon dissolution, withdrawal from the company, termination as an employee, as well as their death or disability. Protecting the family from the marital breakup of a family business owner requires either an agreement with the future spouse or with the other shareholders to buy out the ex-spouse in the event of a divorce.<p>

Employment agreements should be prepared in the same manner as for non-family employees, and deal as well with any ownership issues. Sometimes the use of the family name should be protected by way of a confidentiality agreement or non-competition provision in the
agreement. The provisions of the employment agreement should dovetail with the shareholders agreement. The shareholder agreement should deal with officer responsibilities, directors positions (if any), voting trusts, personal guarantee issues, transfers of shares, valuation of the business for buyouts, and methods of paying any proceeds in a buyout. Super-majority provisions, where all or a substantial majority of the shareholders must agree to an action are common. The issues are really the same as in most closely-held companies.<p>

Antenuptial agreements (pre-marital agreements) are essential for each family member who is getting married and is part of a family-owned business. The antenuptial agreements can waive the spouse's claims against ownership of the family business. Antenuptial agreements are governed by state law, and requirements differ from state to state. They should make sure to choose a knowledgeable lawyer with experience in both family business and antenuptial agreements in their state. These agreements can be tricky and a badly drafted one, that doesn't carefully comply with state law will often be thrown out by the courts. <p>

Unfortunately, antenuptial agreements have to be entered into before the marriage, and will not prevent problems from arising with family members who are already married, in the event of a member's divorce. In that case, shareholder agreements can deal with the issues which would arise in the event of a divorce of one of the family members owners. The shareholders agreement can calculate the value of any member's interests in the family business and the payout of something of equivalent value, rather than splitting up the member's share in the business upon divorce. Courts may not enforce the restrictions on dividing the stock as part of a divorce settlement, but it's worth the attempt.<p>

A good family business lawyer will recommend that all family business members have entered into these key agreements, to protect the other family members.<p>

<A NAME="5"><b>What is the single most important legal issue faced a family business?</b></A><BR>
(<A HREF="#contents">Back to Contents</A>)<p>

It's hard to isolate one legal issue, but I would have to choose estate planning. Without careful estate planning, the government can destroy a business in succession with "death taxes." If the business can survive the lost of the family business leader, and calm the many non-family employees and officers, it still has to face the financing of the estate taxes. Although the federal government allows installment payments on certain qualified estate taxes, the taxes can still be overwhelming. Proper advance planning can minimize the adverse effect of estate taxes. Trusts and family-limited-partnerships are the vehicles being used, along with others, to minimize the tax impact of a shareholder's death.<p>

Depending on the age of the family business leader, insurance may be a preferred mechanism for funding taxes. Disability insurance is recommended as well. Insurance can also be used to fund the buyout in the event of the death, disability or termination of a shareholder, pursuant to the shareholders agreement. Your insurance or financial planner should be consulted as to the cost of funding such provisions with insurance. <p>

<A NAME="6"><b>Are there consultants and advisors specializing in family business to help balance the competing roles or family member and business associate?</b></A><BR>
(<A HREF="#contents">Back to Contents</A>)<p>

The more information made available to family businesses the better. Luckily, in the last 10 years, recognizing the need for formalized training in this area, many leading educational institutions have set up programs for family business study and consulting. We have worked with the George Rothman Institute of Entrepreneurial Studies, at Fairleigh Dickenson University in New Jersey. Through them and centers like them, family businesses can learn how to deal with the problems which are unique to them.<p>

In addition, there are many family business counselors which, like a marriage counselor, helps the families juggle the often competing roles of family member and employee-officer. Sometimes family business bring in a turnaround business specialist or family-business outside manager to help manage the family business during transitions or difficult times. These counselors and business specialists can be sourced from the leading family-business institutes located around the country.<P>

<A NAME="7"><b>Are things improving for family businesses with all this information available to them?</b></A><BR>
(<A HREF="#contents">Back to Contents</A>)<p>

Apparently, things are improving rapidly. The 1995 Mass Mutual survey results disclose that family businesses are taking formal planning more seriously than ever. The survey indicates that the number of owners who report having formalized an intergenerational transition plan, to transfer the operation of the business from one generation to the next, has more than doubled since the first survey in 1993, from 21% to 44% of the number of businesses responding.<p>

We attribute this to two essential factors: better training of the family members and better lawyering among small firm practitioners. <p>

With increasing understanding of their uniqueness and the need to combine good general business skills into the business, many family business leaders are requiring their family members to work for outside businesses before entering the family business. This allows someone else to do the initial and often painful introductory training, and helps the family member understand the need for conducting the family business first as a business. With this and other trends towards outside training,  the business acumen and sophistication of the family members is increasing rapidly.<p>

As the family members are becoming more sophisticated, so are the lawyers who provide them with advice. The demographics of the small firm practitioner has changed. Smaller firms have always been the choice for most of the family-owned businesses in the United States. Because of recent downsizing among the larger firms, and many lawyers having chosen to practice in a small firm environment for their own family reasons, the small firm lawyer is evolving. We are bringing the skills and education we have received representing Fortune 100 companies and learned how to adapt the more important business factors to the family-business model. Better business training on the part of the family members and better lawyering on the part of the advisors combine to make family businesses more formidable every day.<p>

Even with the optimistic increase in the proportion of family businesses having formalizing their transition policies, allowing an orderly transfer of the business from one generation to the next, according to the Mass Mutual results 56% have no formalized transition plans.<p>

<h2>Tips on Dealing with Lawyers</h2>

<P>This page is adapted from <A HREF="/store/lawguide.html">The Court TV Cradle-to-Grave Legal Survival Guide</A>, an easy-to-read, in-depth explanation of the law as it affects all aspects of daily life, written by the editors of  <I>The American Lawyer</I>  and Court TV and published by Little, Brown & Co.</P>

<P>Each state has its own licensing and practice requirements, so you usually will want to start by consulting a lawyer within your own state. An excellent way to begin is to get recommendations from friends and relatives who have hired lawyers in the past. In addition to getting names and phone numbers, you should question your friends:

<UL>
<LI>What kinds of legal problems did they have? (If your problem has to do with your small business, you probably don't need a lawyer who specializes in divorce.)

<LI>Were they satisfied?

<LI>Did the lawyer do what he or she promised?

<LI>Did the lawyer return phone calls? 

<LI>Was the fee reasonable?
</UL>

<P>A great place to find a lawyer is <A HREF="http://www.counsel.com/lawyersearch/">Lawyer Search</a>, the online directory of over 25,000 lawyers brought to you by <a href=http://www.counsel.com/about.htm>Counsel Connect</a>.</P>

<P>If you know you need a lawyer to help you with a specific problem, and would like to solicit bids for the work, you might try Counsel Connect's new service, <a href=http://www.counsel.com/qrfp/>Quick Request for Proposals</a>.</P>

<P>You can also ask your <A HREF="http://www.courttv.com/legalhelp/survival/resources/220.html">state bar association</a> for recommendations, since many maintain lawyer referral lists by area of practice. To get on these lists, lawyers usually have to show the bar association that they have adequate experience in that practice area. A lawyer who ill-served clients would not likely stay on the list for long.<p></P>

<P>You might also try contacting any law schools in your area, since many have clinics that provide some legal services.</P>

<P><B>What questions should you ask a lawyer before deciding whether to hire him or her?</B></P>

<P>There are a number of questions you should ask, including:

<UL>
<LI>How long has he or she been in practice? 

<LI>What kind of experience does the lawyer have, especially in the area of your problem? 

<LI>Has his or her practice been in the same community? 

<LI>The names of a couple of former clients to check with as references. (The lawyer will have to get the clients' permission to do this.)</UL>

<P>Good lawyers will be willing to discuss their experience with you. They should also be willing to answer specific questions about structuring a working relationship with you, including:

<UL>
<LI> Will you return my phone calls within a day or two?

<LI> Will you describe your fee structure in a written retainer agreement?

<LI> Will your bills specify the work done, when, and by whom?

<LI> Will you give me at least monthly progress reports?

<LI> Will you consult me on all important decisions in my matter?
</UL>

<h2>Abortion</h2>

<P>Most of these files are excerpted from The Court TV Cradle-to-Grave Legal Survival Guide, an easy-to-read, in-depth explanation of the law as it affects all aspects of daily life. You can order the book, published by Little, Brown and Company, from our <A HREF="/store/">online store</A>. It also is available in local bookstores, or you can call Little, Brown directly at (800) 333-3476.</P>

<P><B>In what ways, if any, can the government limit a woman's right to an abortion?</B><BR>
In 1973, the Supreme Court issued its historic decision in Roe v. Wade, which established the constitutional right of a woman to choose to terminate her pregnancy. While the decision stated that the government may not restrict a woman's right to an abortion during the first three months of her pregnancy (known as the first trimester), it did allow states to impose regulations during the later stages.</P>

<P>According to the decision, a state could regulate abortion procedures during the second trimester in ways that were "reasonably related to maternal health." (The state could, for example, require that persons performing abortions meet certain qualifications and that the facilities where they were performed be licensed.) During the third trimester, the Court ruled, the fetus was then "viable" -- capable of surviving if it were born. Since the government has an interest in promoting life and the potential of life, the Court ruled that during this trimester a state could regu~late or even prohibit abortion, except when an abortion was necessary to protect the life or health of the mother.</P>

<P>In the years since Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court has chipped away at the right to choose an abortion. In its 1992 decision, Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the Court reaffirmed the right of a woman to terminate her pregnancy but discarded Roe's trimester framework. This decision allows states to enact regulations on abortion during any trimester so long as the regulations do not impose an "undue burden" on a woman's ability to terminate her pregnancy. The following regulations were found to be permissible limitations on a woman's right to choose:</P>

<P>An informed consent provision requiring that physicians provide women seeking abortions with information about fetal development
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>A 24-hour waiting period
	<LI>A one-parent consent requirement for minors with a "judicial bypass" procedure
	<LI>A requirement that abortion facilities file a confidential report on every abortion performed
	<LI>So while a state cannot deny a woman the right to have an abortion, it can impose the above requirements.
</UL>

<P><B>If a woman wants an abortion, can her husband veto that decision?</B><BR>
No. The Casey decision found that a provision requiring a woman to get her husband's consent to an abortion was an undue burden on the right to choose, and thus was unconstitutional. So a husband does not have a right to veto an abortion, nor does he have to give his consent before one can be performed.</P>

<P>Future litigation in the abortion arena will likely focus on what other types of state restrictions do or do not constitute undue burdens on a woman's right to choose to terminate her pregnancy.</P>

<P><B>Does a minor have to get parental permission for an abortion?</B><BR>
It depends on the state she lives in. In several states, minors can obtain abortions without the knowledge of their parents, but many states have placed restrictions on their ability to do so. Some states require a minor to notify one or both of her parents before obtaining an abortion. Other states require a minor to get the consent of one or both of her parents. (In both procedures, parents are usually asked to sign a document that says they've been informed. Some doctors will require that the signature be notarized.)</P>

<P>While one or both parents may refuse to provide consent, they cannot veto the minor's right to have an abortion. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that states that require parental notification or consent must provide an option of "judicial bypass" for minors who cannot (or choose not to) inform their parents before obtaining an abortion. In the "judicial bypass" process, the minor appears before a judge and presents her case. If the judge determines that the young woman is mature enough to understand all of the consequences of her situation and her decision to have an abortion, the judge can grant her permission to proceed.</P>

<P>If the woman can show that she is an emancipated minor, then she may be able to get an abortion without notifying her parents because she has all the rights of an adult.</P>

<h2>Adoption</h2>

<P>Most of these files are excerpted from The Court TV Cradle-to-Grave Legal Survival Guide, an easy-to-read, in-depth explanation of the law as it affects all aspects of daily life. You can order the book, published by Little, Brown and Company, from our <a href="/store/">online store</a>. It also is available in local bookstores, or you can call Little, Brown directly at (800) 333-3476.<P></P>

<P><B>How does adoption work?</B><BR>
Every state has agencies, either run by the state or licensed and monitored by the state, which arrange and supervise adoptions. An agency works with both the birth parents and the adoptive parents, offering counseling and advice and matching up adoptive parents with children. Typically the adoptive parents will pay the birth mother's medical, living, and legal expenses associated with the pregnancy and adoption, and an agency will usually help each party complete the legal process of adoption.</P>

<P>You may also choose to adopt an older child. The issues are much the same, although if a child is in foster care, the biological parent's rights may already have been terminated. In some states, such as New Jersey, the foster care family gets first choice on whether or not to adopt a child who has lived with the family for more than two years.</P>

<P>The actual adoption procedure varies from state to state. You may adopt a child that lives in another state, but you have to make sure you comply with the requirements of each state when you do so. All states, for instance, require adoptive parents to have a "home study" in which a social worker or other authorized official interviews them and inspects their home to determine if they are "fit" to adopt. An adoption is not finalized until the court approves it.</P>

<P>You can find adoption agencies listed in the phone book, although you may want to get a referral from a friend instead. That way you have a better idea of what to expect from the particular agency.</P>

<P><B>What is a private adoption?</B><BR>
A private, or independent, adoption occurs when there is no agency involvement. Instead, a connection is made between a woman who wants to surrender a child for adoption and a couple who seeks to adopt a child, often by an intermediary such as a friend, an attorney, a doctor or other third party. This practice has become more and more frequent in the United States, and you may see advertisements in the classified sections of newspapers for private adoptions. Remember, however, that it is illegal to pay someone for a baby. So, if the payments involved in a private adoption exceed the reasonable medical and legal expenses of the mother or if there is a "brokerage" fee to a third party, everyone involved runs the risk of being prosecuted for selling a baby.</P>

<P><B>Is it possible to adopt a baby from another state or even another country?</B><BR>
Yes, but if you want to adopt a child from somewhere other than your own state, you may need the assistance of a specialized agency. Adopting a child from another country is especially complicated. You will have to complete vast amounts of paperwork and deal extensively with the Immigration and Naturalization Service. (For more information on INS rules and regulations, call 1-202-514-5014.) Your best approach is to research the alternatives. Find other parents who have adopted from the country or area from which you wish to adopt. Find out the name of their adoption attorney and any agencies they used. Ask around for recommendations and look for support groups or other less formal organizations for people in your situation. It is certainly not something that you will want to tackle alone.</P>

<P><B>Can anyone adopt a child?</B><BR>
There was a time when only certain people who satisfied traditional notions of "normalcy" could adopt. Then, the Civil Rights and women's movements in the 60's and 70's promoted change, and today many factors that would have once been crucial, such as marital status, religious affiliations and race, are barely considered. Instead, the focus is on what is best for the child and not what is "normal."</P>

<P>The rules still vary tremendously from state to state. Two states, Florida and New Hampshire, have outright bans against lesbian and gay adoptions (Florida's law was declared unconstitutional by a state court in 1991, but an appeal is pending), and in April 1994 a District of Columbia court ruled that two unmarried domestic partners may not adopt the same child, though either of them could do so as a single parent.</P>

<P>You should consult an agency or attorney to find out the specifics where you live.</P>

<P><B>What happens when a woman chooses adoption?</B><BR>
Giving up a child for adoption traditionally meant totally surrendering all rights and responsibilities as that child's parent. However, some states now allow open adoption, in which the birth mother may retain some visitation privileges.</P>

<P>If you choose a traditional adoption it will at some point become irrevocable and thus, it is not a decision to be made lightly or quickly. The doctor or clinic where you go for your physical examination should be able to help you with the decision and give you information about your options. If you do decide to give the child up for adoption, you will be required to sign a legal document in which you agree to give up your parental rights.</P>

<P>Your state will have an agency or agencies that handle adoptions and can place your child in foster care until a family is found. There are private agencies as well, many of them run by churches or other religious organizations with which you might feel more comfortable. You may also arrange an adoption with a private couple, but remember that it is illegal for someone to pay you money for your child. The couple who wishes to adopt your baby may agree to pay your medical expenses and the hospitalization costs for you and the child at the time you give birth. You should consult a lawyer about your rights and responsibilities.</P>

<P><B>What happens if the birth mother changes her mind?</B><BR>
Most states have a waiting period after a parent gives a child up for adoption during which the mother can change her mind. If she does, the adoption will not go through, and she must take the child back and assume all the rights and responsibilities that go along with being a parent.</P>

<P>She may also be able to rescind the adoption, even if it is already complete, if she can show that she did not consent, or that her consent was obtained by fraud or duress. Does the birth mother (or father) have the right to visit the child once it's adopted? Traditionally, parents who give up their children for adoption have surrendered all of their rights and responsibilities toward the child. The adoptive parents become the adopted child's "real" parents for all purposes, as though the birth parents never existed. In such a situation, obviously, the birth parents have no rights of visitation or any other involvement in the child's life.</P>

<P>However, there is a growing trend towards what is known as open adoption. In such an adoption, the biological mother surrenders all of her legal rights and responsibilities the same as in a traditional adoption. However, the adoptive parents agree to let her visit the child on occasion and on a schedule that is acceptable to everyone involved. In this way, adopted children are not cut off from their biological heritage. And, the knowledge that visitation is possible sometimes makes it easier for a pregnant woman to choose the option of adoption</P>

<P><B>Does the father have a say?</B><BR>
Yes. If the child is to be put up for adoption, most state statutes require that the father, if he is known, be notified. If he wants to raise the child, he generally will be allowed to do so unless there is a challenge to his fitness as a parent. If, however, he does not want the child to be adopted, but refuses to care for the child himself, he cannot force the mother to keep the child. The state will terminate his parental rights and release the child for adoption. He can't just stand in the way of an adoption without assuming full responsibility for the child.</P>

<P><B>Could he stop the mother from having an abortion?</B><BR>
No. While the father may intervene if the baby is being given up for adoption, he may not intervene if the mother decides to have an abortion. It is the biological mother's right to decide what to do when she becomes pregnant. Although it may seem unfair, the only "say" or choice a man has with regard to pregnancy occurs at the moment of intercourse -- when he chooses whether or not to take precautions.</P>

<P><B>Aren't adoption records supposed to be sealed permanently?</B><BR>
In order to protect the privacy of the birth parents and the adopted child, adoption records in most states automatically are sealed to prevent access by the public. In the 1970's and 80's, there was a growing movement towards opening up these records so that adopted children and their birth parents could renew their relationships. At the same time, there was a very strong movement against this practice because of the loss of privacy and the potential emotional conflict and even embarrassment that might be caused. What if, for instance, a birth mother had gone on to marry and have a family without telling her spouse about the child she gave up for adoption, and the child one day showed up? Or, what if adoptive parents had not told their child that he or she was adopted and the child's birth mother arrived on their front doorstep?</P>

<P>Due to these movements, many states have now instituted programs that attempt to balance the right to privacy with the right to know the truth. There are now open adoptions, in which the birth parent has a right to visitation with the child even after the adoption. There are also provisions that allow an adopted child who has reached the age of 18 to learn the identity of his or her birth parents. Some states only allow identities to be revealed when both the birth mother and the adopted child give permission. In such cases, if either the birth parent or the adopted child refuses to allow the information to be released, then it won't be. The adoption will remain confidential. Also, in some instances, if the adopted child develops a serious health problem, the identity of the birth parents may be revealed if it is believed that genetic information would be helpful.</P>

<P><B>Can the biological mother do anything if she thinks the people who adopted her child are unfit?</B><BR>
It depends on whether a court order has been issued finalizing the adoption. (The process varies from state to state. Most states have a waiting period before an adoption is final during which it can be rescinded.) If a mother discovers something about the adoptive parents that would cause a threat to the child (such as drug or alcohol abuse or abuse of the child), before the adoption is final, she may be able to rescind the adoption. However, once the adoption is final, she has given up all of her rights and responsibilities as a parent. This means that she has no decision making power with respect to the child's upbringing. What school he or she goes to, what religion he or she is raised in, and whether or not spanking is an appropriate punishment are all decisions made by the adoptive parents. They have the same rights and control over the child's upbringing as the birth mother would have had if she kept the child.</P>

<P>Of course, if you suspect that your child is being abused or neglected, you have the same obligation to report the parents to the appropriate state agency as you would with any child. However, even if the adoptive parents are later found to be unfit and their rights as the child's parents are terminated, your "standing" to get the child back may not be any greater than anyone else's, since you became like a stranger to the child when you gave him or her up for adoption. That is not to say that you cannot obtain custody of the child, but it will be difficult.</P>

<P><B>Can an adoption be rescinded?</B><BR>
Once an adoption is final, it is very difficult to rescind. You will need a lawyer who is experienced in adoption law and in this type of lawsuit. However, most states will permit a parent to rescind an adoption if it was obtained through force, fraud or other improper means. There may be a time limit on when you can bring your lawsuit. Most likely, if you do bring a lawsuit to try to set aside the adoption, the judge's decision will depend very heavily on the individual facts in your case, and you will be faced with the very difficult task of proving that the adoptive parents not only acted in a way that deceived you but that they intended to deceive you.</P>

<P><B>Can an adoption be rescinded if the child is not healthy?</B><BR>
It is always a terrible thing when a child falls ill, especially when the illness is permanent or fatal. Some parents do find that emotionally and financially they cannot deal with the child, especially if the couple has other, healthy children who also need support and love. However, most states will not permit parents to return a child they have adopted, although it may be possible to rescind an adoption if the adoptive parents were deceived or defrauded (if, for example, the agency knew the child was ill, but never informed the adoptive parents).</P>

<P>In either case, whether you are a biological or an adoptive parent, and you find that you are completely unable to care for the child (either physically, financially, or emotionally), you can voluntarily surrender the child to the care of the state, and the child will be placed in a foster home or in a state-run institution. The state will carry at least some of the financial costs of the child's treatment. However, by doing so, you probably will have to navigate through a morass of state bureaucracy, including court appearances, home investigations by social workers and an almost total surrendering of your privacy as parents. The end result of such an action may very well be a termination of your parental rights.</P>

<P>Before it gets to that point, however, you should be sure that you have exhausted all of your possible resources. You may be able to get state or federal assistance for the child's illness if you cannot afford to pay for the care yourself or if your insurance will not cover it. You should fully investigate your options before making a decision.</P>

<h2>Appointing a Guardian for Your Child</h2>

<P>Most of these files are excerpted from The Court TV Cradle-to-Grave Legal Survival Guide, an easy-to-read, in-depth explanation of the law as it affects all aspects of daily life. You can order the book, published by Little, Brown and Company, from our <a href="/store/">online store</a>. It also is available in local bookstores, or you can call Little, Brown directly at (800) 333-3476.<P></P>

<P><B>What exactly is a legal guardian?</B><BR>
A legal guardian is someone who is not the parent of the child, but who has the legal right and authority to act as a parent to that child. You should designate a legal guardian for your children if you believe that you will become unable to care for them, and if there is no other parent to care for them. For example, if you become very ill and must be hospitalized for an extended period of time, your children would need adult supervision by someone who is legally responsible for them.</P>

<P>Generally, it is necessary for a court to approve a permanent appointment of guardianship. Your wishes will be given consideration, but they don't always have to be followed if the court believes it would not be in the best interests of the child. You usually can, however, authorize someone to care for your child on a short-term basis in a less formal manner.</P>

<P><B>What happens to a child if both parents die?</B><BR>
As soon as a child is conceived, you should be thinking about the possibility that at some point while he or she is still a minor, you may both die. You should begin to consider who would be an appropriate guardian for the child in that event and speak to that person about whether or not he or she is willing to be the guardian. If the person agrees, both parents should draft a will, which appoints that person as the legal guardian for the child in the event they both die. You should also consider selecting a trustee who can oversee any money the child inherits, since the child will not be able to take direct control of assets like bank accounts or a house. The legal guardian may be an appropriate person to appoint as trustee of the estate as well.</P>

<P>If both parents die without a will appointing a guardian, the situation becomes more complicated. Fortunately, the days of dreary orphanages and workhouses are gone, but most parents would probably prefer to avoid the possibility of their children being placed in foster care or a state-run institution. Also, if you die without a will the state won't know your preferences and might appoint a relative as guardian for your child whom you would prefer not to have. For example, you may disagree with your sister's method of child rearing, or you may despise your wife's brother, but the state agency and court system making the determination about what happens to your child doesn't know those things. A state's preference is to place children with relatives who are willing and able to care for them. Don't leave these decisions of such paramount importance to be decided by a bureaucratic state process.</P>

<P><B>How do you appoint a legal guardian?</B><BR>
To avoid any confusion about your intentions, it's best to state your wishes for a legal guardian in writing. You should also specify the circumstances under which you want the person to act as a guardian (perhaps only while you are in the hospital for surgery, for instance), and the duration of the guardianship.</P>

<P>For short-term situations, you may be able to fill out a simple form granting someone temporary authority to make decisions regarding your child. If you only want to grant authority to someone like a babysitter to make medical decisions in the event of an emergency, you could assign that person a limited power of attorney. The rules on how to grant short-term or permanent guardianship vary from state to state, so if you have reason to believe that your appointment will be challenged, you should see a lawyer.</P>

<h2>Child Abuse and Neglect</h2>

<P>Most of these files are excerpted from The Court TV Cradle-to-Grave Legal Survival Guide, an easy-to-read, in-depth explanation of the law as it affects all aspects of daily life. You can order the book, published by Little, Brown and Company, from our online store. It also is available in local bookstores, or you can call Little, Brown directly at (800) 333-3476.</P>

<P><B>What is child abuse?</B><BR>
Abuse can be very hard to define. We all think we know it when we see it, but in actuality, whether a particular action constitutes abuse depends heavily on the circumstances and the social climate. Not so long ago, physical punishment and beatings were widely accepted as a method of punishment and discipline of even small children. Now, many parents are foregoing the physical aspect of punishment. In fact, in Sweden parents are forbidden by law to spank or slap a child for any reason.</P>

<P>Child abuse and neglect are generally defined by state statutes. Abuse usually occurs when a parent purposefully harms a child. Neglect usually arises from a parent's passive indifference to a child's well-being. Thus, physical actions that injure the child (such as hitting or kicking) would constitute abuse. In contrast, leaving the child alone or failing to feed him or her for a long period of time would constitute neglect. Placing the child in a dangerous situation might be both. You would have to check the statute in your state to find out exactly what the definitions of child abuse and child neglect are. In most cases, you can discipline your child with a slap or a spanking so long as you don't cause physical injury.</P>

<P>Whether an act constitutes abuse or neglect will also depend in large part upon the particular child involved. A mature 10-year-old might be able to handle being alone for an hour, while an immature 10-year-old might not. The parents' right to bring up their children as they see fit has to be balanced with the state's obligation to protect children who cannot protect themselves. The movie Home Alone, though a comedy, horrified many people because of the apparent negligence and uncaringness of the parents who didn't notice that their child was not with them. Whether a parent's action is excusable will depend upon the state statute and the specific circumstances of the case.</P>

<P><B>Are people required to report suspicions of abuse or neglect?</B><BR>
It depends on your relationship to the child. All states have mandatory reporting statutes, so if you have good reason to believe that a child is being abused, you may be required to report it to the appropriate authorities (the police or a child welfare or social services agency). In most states, the law specifies that certain people in positions of authority with regard to children, such as doctors, teachers, nurses and daycare workers, report suspicions of abuse. However, some states require any person who suspects abuse to report it. So if you believe that a child you know or work with is being abused or neglected, it is imperative that you find out the extent of your obligation to report your suspicions. You may be subject to penalties for not reporting it if there is genuine abuse. The penalties vary from state to state. If you report a suspicion and are wrong, it's possible that you could be sued for libel or slander.</P>

<P><B>What gives the government the right to investigate?</B><BR>
The state has the power to pass and enforce laws for the protection of children (and adults, too). This is based on the idea that certain people, like children and the mentally ill, are unable to speak up for themselves and assert their own rights. Therefore, the government will do it for them.  Thus, if a child is being abused by his or her parents, the state has the authority and the power to intervene. (When the government acts on behalf of a child or mentally ill person, it is asserting its role of parens patriae, Latin for "parent of his country." It refers to the "state" as the guardian of minors and incompetent people.) Understandably, a parent may be terrified of an accusation of abuse--especially if it is untrue. But if a parent refuses to cooperate with an investigation, the children could be taken away--at least for the duration of the inquiry.</P>

<P><B>Who represents the child?</B><BR>
The judge supervising the process usually will appoint a guardian ad Litem, or guardian at law. This person, typically a lawyer or government social service worker, represents the interests of the child (not the needs or desires of the parents) throughout the legal process of investigating whether or not to terminate the parent's rights. A guardian ad litem is different from a "legal guardian"; the guardian ad litem represents the child throughout the legal process, while a "legal guardian," is assigned to take the place of a parent.</P>

<P><B>What happens when parents are suspected of abuse?</B><BR>
Once suspected abuse is reported, the state's investigation will begin, and it will not cease until a determination regarding the abuse has been made. The investigation may involve:
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>physical examinations of the child
	<LI>visits to the home
	<LI>interviews with the parents, the child and other individuals who may have been witnesses
	<LI>a psychological evaluation of the family
</UL>

<P>If it is determined that the child is in physical danger from his or her parents, the state may remove the child from the home and place him or her in foster care. Because the system is primarily concerned with the protection of children, parents who are the subject of an investigation should seek the assistance of an attorney who can help them through all of the steps in the procedure and protect their interests.</P>

<h2>Foster Care</h2>

<P>Most of these files are excerpted from <A HREF="/legalhelp/survival/about/">The Court TV Cradle-to-Grave Legal Survival Guide</a>, an easy-to-read, in-depth explanation of the law as it affects all aspects of daily life. You can order the book, published by Little, Brown and Company, from our <a href="/store/">online store</a>. It also is available in local bookstores, or you can call Little, Brown directly at (800) 333-3476.</P>

<P><B>What is a foster parent?</B><BR>
Foster parents are individuals who volunteer and are approved to provide homes for children who are unable to remain with their parents for one reason or another. A child may be placed in foster care as a result of:
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>child abuse or neglect
	<LI>a custodial parent's imprisonment
	<LI>extended illness of the custodial parent
	<LI>other family crisis where there are no relatives or friends who can care for the child
</UL>

<P>A child may also be placed in foster care voluntarily by his or her parents, if the parents feel that they are simply unable to care appropriately for the child. Unfortunately, in reality, once a parent places a child in the foster care system voluntarily, it is often difficult to get the child back. That is why most parents do not do so.</P>

<P><B>Are foster parents paid?</B><BR>
Yes. They receive a small sum of money on a monthly basis to help defray the costs of caring for the child in their home. The child also receives medical benefits from the state, which retains legal custody of the child. In general, though, a foster parent acts with much of the same authority as a biological parent. A foster parent oversees the child on a day-to-day basis, providing a stable home, discipline and affection. A foster parent often has the right to decide if the child needs medical care and take the child to the doctor, although sometimes decisions, such as ones about medical care or travel, will have to be made by the state agency in charge or even the biological parent.</P>

<P><B>What rights do the biological parents have when a child is in foster care?</B><BR>
It depends in great measure upon the circumstances under which the child was placed in foster care. When a parent voluntarily surrenders his or her child to foster care, the state should (and by law often must) allow for reasonable visitation by the biological parent. On the other hand, if the child was physically or sexually abused, the situation is very different. The parent may be entitled to have minimal visitation in a supervised setting, but it is unlikely that an abusive parent would be able to take a child out unsupervised. The amount and type of visitation will depend on the state's law and on the particular circumstances of the individual case.</P>

<P><B>Does the child have any say in the situation?</B><BR>
The guiding principle in foster care decisions will be to do what is in the best interests of the child. In reality, the child will have very little control over the process, although the judge will probably listen to his or her feelings, especially if the child is old enough to express them maturely.</P>

<P><B>Can the biological parent get his or her children back?</B><BR>
Yes, but it's not easy, and there's no guarantee you will be able to do so. Since the system often gives a parent a lot of leeway before taking away a child, you will have to show good evidence that you are a fit parent and that it's safe to return the child to your care. It's usually helpful to have a lawyer's help in such proceedings. If you can afford to pay a lawyer, it's best to find someone who has experience with this kind of case. You can try to get recommendations from the following sources:   Local law schools. Ask a professor of family law who's good in your area.  Legal aid lawyers. Ask for names of former lawyers who left to work in private practice.  The court's guardian ad litem program administrators.  Psychologists or other professionals who deal with custody issues.</P>

<P>If you cannot afford a lawyer to help you in a proceeding to get your child back, you are entitled to have one appointed.</P>

<H2>Parental Obligations and Liabilities</H2>

<P>Most of these files are excerpted from The Court TV Cradle-to-Grave Legal Survival Guide, an easy-to-read, in-depth explanation of the law as it affects all aspects of daily life. You can order the book, published by Little, Brown and Company, from our <A HREF="/store/">online store</A>. It also is available in local bookstores, or you can call Little, Brown directly at (800) 333-3476.</P>

<P><B>What obligations do parents have to support their children?</B><BR>
Every parent has a legal duty to provide basic financial support for his or her children. At a minimum, parents have to provide food, shelter and clothing, and they may also have to provide other luxuries depending on the lifestyle they have led and can afford.  In many states, a parent's duty to support a child ends at the point when the child is emancipated (legally an adult) regardless of whether the child is actually capable of supporting himself or herself. (In most states, a child is considered to be an adult when he or she turns 18.) However, some states have modified this harsh rule to require parents to support their children beyond their 18th birthday; in fact, in some states, such as New Jersey, the parents may even be required to provide a college education. States will also require a parent to continue supporting a child over 18 if the child would otherwise have to go on welfare and become a "public charge."  You would have to consult a lawyer about the law in your state before making any decisions as to whether or not you can withhold financial support to one of your children.</P>

<P><B>Can a parent kick a child out of the house?</B><BR>
Not usually. A parent has certain obligations to support a child through emancipation. If you do not do so, or if you refuse to permit your child to reside with you, you could face accusations of abuse or neglect with very serious consequences. Before things get so bad, you should seek family counseling or other help to alleviate the situation.</P>

<P><B>What kind of medical care, if any, are parents required to provide their children?</B><BR>
In general, parents are legally responsible for the "reasonably necessary" medical expenses of their children. For the most part, a parent's consent to medical treatment is required, although many states allow for exceptions in the case of emergencies, pregnancy, venereal disease or alcoholism. Parents are required to consent for two reasons:   They have the right, as well as the obligation, to determine what is best for their children  They are going to be responsible for paying the bill. </P>

<P>If a child does not get adequate medical treatment, it could be considered neglect. So could a mother's use of alcohol or drugs during pregnancy. While parents have the right to weigh the risks and benefits of a proposed procedure, if a child's life is in danger a court might overrule a parent's refusal of treatment and let the government intervene -- even when the parent refuses treatment because of religious beliefs.  If a parent can't afford to pay for medical care, there are state and federal programs, such as Medicaid and Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), which may provide assistance.  If you find that you are unable to care for your child for any reason--physical, financial, or emotional--you can voluntarily surrender the child to the care of the state. If you do so, however, the state may begin the process to terminate your parental rights. For more, see page.</P>

<P><B>What about immunizations? Are they required?</B><BR>
This is an area in which the government can dictate a parental medical decision. Because of the dangers to the population at large from a child with an infectious disease such as smallpox or measles, most states require children to be vaccinated against certain diseases before they can attend school.  If your child does not have the shots, he or she cannot attend school, and if he or she does not attend school, you are in violation of compulsory schooling laws. However, some states do allow a child to forego the immunizations for religious reasons or if the vaccination would be medically dangerous or harmful to the child.  If you object to immunizations, you should find out the rules in your state. Your local school board can probably advise you whether your objection would be accepted and honored.</P>

<P><B>Can parents be sued if their child hurts someone?</B> <BR>
Yes, in certain cases. Almost every state has enacted laws that impose limited liability on parents for intentional harm caused by their children. Unintentional harms  cannot be the subject of a suit against child or parent. But say a child had announced she was going to break another child's finger. If she then bent it back, or used an instrument such as a hammer to do it, parents could be liable for their own negligence in failing to exercise reasonable control over a child they know has vicious or violent tendencies. They might also be liable for negligently entrusting a dangerous item to a child.  Surprisingly, perhaps, it's possible in some cases for a child to be sued for his or her negligent acts. An act is generally considered negligent when a person fails to take "due care" and that failure causes harm to another person or their property. Typically, the "due care" expected of a minor is less than that demanded of an adult, and in most states, the minor must be sued through a parent or guardian.  Older minors, particularly when they perform adult actions, such as driving a car, are often liable to the same extent as an adult. The age of the child is key: Very young children cannot fully understand and appreciate the responsibility of due care, and so can't be held liable. Some states set a minimum age for liability, such as seven; but in most states, the cutoff will depend upon the circumstances, including the maturity of the child and the nature of the activity.  It is rare that a child is sued personally, and the main reason for doing so is to collect from the family's insurance if the child is included in the coverage.</P>

<P><B>Is a parent liable if a child's friend is injured while climbing a tree in the backyard?</B><BR>
Perhaps. A parent has a duty to warn a visitor of any hidden hazards that he or she knows about, so if you know that a tree is dead and scheduled to be cut down, you cannot idly stand by as a child climbs it. If on the other hand a tree is healthy, then your responsibility for the well-being of someone else's child depends upon the level of supervision that you accepted. The child's age is also an important factor; the younger the child, the more supervision he or she requires. It may be reasonable for a mother to assume two 12-year-olds can play safely in a tree unattended. It may not be reasonable, however, if they are only five years old.</P>

<P><B>Are parents responsible for property damage by their child?</B><BR>
Usually. Nearly every state has laws that hold parents responsible for intentional or willful torts committed by minors, including vandalism. This is a type of "vicarious liability," which means it is not based on the fault of the parents. However, liability under these statutes is limited to relatively low amounts. For example, Texas limits a parent's liability  to $5,000 for each act; Iowa's limit is $1,000 for each act. That means that if a kid burns down your entire house, all you can collect from the parents is the limit set by the state. Even if the child's parents are wealthy and the kid has a trust fund, it will be well-nigh impossible to try to get any money from them. If a child causes damage to your property, it's often best to try and meet with the parents to work out a deal.</P>

<P><B>Are parents liable when their child accidentally hits someone with a ball during a game?</B><BR>
Probably not. A participant in a sport assumes the ordinary and expected risks that are inherent in the sport. Even professional ball players are occasionally hit by batted balls.</P>

<P><B>Are parents liable for the actions of their bully children?</B><BR>
Yes, they may be. If the offending child has a vicious or violent temperament, his parents probably were aware of it or should have been, and they may be liable for failing to exercise reasonable control over the child. Proof that a child has violent tendencies includes previous incidents of assault or cruelty which were made known to the parents. If the child has never been vicious before, then the parents have no way of predicting or preventing the first outbreak, so it would be very difficult to establish liability.</P>

<P><B>What happens when parents win a lawsuit on behalf of their child?</B><BR>
Parents receive the money, in their capacity as the natural guardians of their minor children. However, they can't spend it without court approval. They must manage the money by keeping it in a separate account earmarked for the child. Though the rules vary from state to state, the money or property usually must be made available to the child when he or she reaches the age of majority (in most states, age 18).</P>

<P><B>Are parents required to send their children to school?</B><BR>
Every state has adopted laws that require attendance at school for some minimum period of a child's life, usually from ages 5 or 6 to 14 or 16. Parents, however, have the right to decide which schools their children go to, whether public or private, parochial or secular.  If you want to educate your child at home, for whatever reason, your state's law may require that you first get the approval of your local school board. Children who are taught at home are often required to take year-end examinations to evaluate their progress. If they fail to fulfill the state requirements for each grade level, the state law may require that they receive additional tutoring. You may also have to attend a hearing to determine whether it is appropriate for your children to be taught at home.  If you are interested in teaching your children at home, you should first contact your local public school board. You might also contact a lawyer to find out what the procedure is in your state.</P>

<P><B>Do child actors have to go to school?</B><BR>
Child actors and performers are not exempt from the requirement of education; their circumstances just make their learning process a bit different from that of the ordinary child. Generally, child performers receive private tutoring for several hours per day. Like any child, they must satisfy certain minimum requirements before they can advance to the next grade level.</P>

<h2>Prenuptial Agreements</h2>

<P>Most of these files are excerpted from The Court TV Cradle-to-Grave Legal Survival Guide, an easy-to-read, in-depth explanation of the law as it affects all aspects of daily life. You can order the book, published by Little, Brown and Company, from our <a href="/store/">online store</a>. It also is available in local bookstores, or you can call Little, Brown directly at (800) 333-3476.</P>

<P><B>What is a prenuptial agreement?</B><BR>
A prenuptial agreement (also called a premarital or antenuptial agreement) is a contract between two people who intend to marry. It can address how you will divide your property and responsibilities:
<UL>
	<LI>during the marriage
	<LI>at the death of either spouse
	<LI>at their divorce
</UL>

<P>Basically, you can use the prenuptial agreement to dictate everything from how the monthly bills will get paid to what religious institutions your children will attend. However, one of the main reasons that you might want a prenuptial agreement is to insure that what is yours before the marriage remains yours if the marriage ends.</P>

<P><B>Who should have one?</B><BR>
Most often, a prenuptial agreement is used by people who are getting married for the second or third time or in a situation where one person has substantially more income or assets than the other person coming into the marriage. However, in light of the increased divorce rate in this country, many people are using prenuptial agreements as a way of decreasing the emotional and financial toll of divorce by specifying in advance how their marital property will be divided.</P>

<P><B>Do both parties need a lawyer?</B><BR>
Yes. It is certainly wise for both people to be represented by independent attorneys who can advise you about your rights and obligations. In fact, some states require it for the contract to be enforceable. They also require that both parties provide each other with full disclosure of their assets and income. You should both be aware of what you would be entitled to under the law of your state should the marriage break up. This helps prevent the possibility that one person will later challenge the prenuptial agreement as "unconscionable," so unfair that it cannot be upheld.</P>

<P><B>A prenuptial agreement might be invalid if:</B><BR>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>one party withheld important financial information
	<LI>one party exerted force to get the other to sign
	<LI>the terms of the agreement would leave one of the parties destitute
</UL>

<P>Both parties must enter into the agreement with good faith, that is, honestly and without deception. And both parties must have put all their cards on the table and made a full and accurate disclosure of the important and relevant facts -- their income, assets, liabilities, and anything else that would be important to someone deciding whether to sign the agreement. Many states require this financial disclosure to be in writing.</P>

<h2>Surrogate Parenting</h2>

<P>Most of these files are excerpted from The Court TV Cradle-to-Grave Legal Survival Guide, an easy-to-read, in-depth explanation of the law as it affects all aspects of daily life. You can order the book, published by Little, Brown and Company, from our <a href="/store/">online store</a>. It also is available in local bookstores, or you can call Little, Brown directly at (800) 333-3476.</P>

<P><B>How does surrogate parenting work?</B><BR>
In the typical surrogacy arrangement, a married couple makes a deal with a woman (the surrogate) who agrees to be impregnated with the husband's sperm, usually through artificial means. In a contract (usually written), the surrogate promises to surrender all her rights as the child's biological parent, so that the wife can adopt the child. Typically, the couple pays for the surrogate's medical and living expenses during her pregnancy, which include money for housing and food.  There are also cases where a surrogate agrees to be implanted with an embryo that was fertilized in vitro using the wife's egg and the husband's sperm. In such a situation, the surrogate essentially serves as a receptacle to carry the developing fetus.</P>

<P><B>Are these arrangements legal?</B><BR>
Yes, in most states. However, a few states, including New York, Michigan and Florida, consider paid surrogacy the equivalent of baby-selling and thus have outlawed it. Some other states will not enforce a surrogacy contract if a dispute arises, but they don't make the transaction illegal. In general, though, this is an area of the law that is still developing. The most important thing to know when contemplating a surrogacy arrangement is that most states consider it a crime to sell a baby. So, generally, if a contract says that the surrogate mother will bear a child to be adopted in exchange for a specified sum of money that contract might not be valid. And, in fact, the parties could be subject to criminal prosecution. However, if the contract says that the surrogate mother will be paid a specified sum to cover the costs associated with her pregnancy, that is more likely to be valid.  Before making any surrogacy deals, you should discuss the issues with an attorney in your state who is experienced in family law.</P>

<P><B>Is it legal to use a "broker"?</B><BR>
A "broker or "intermediary" is a person who matches up a surrogate mother with an infertile couple. If you're paying a broker just to introduce you to someone, you very well may be violating a criminal statute against baby selling. Often, however, the intermediary will be a lawyer who brings the parties together, oversees the negotiations and drafts the agreement. So long as this lawyer charges a reasonable fee for itemized services, it probably won't be considered baby selling. But if, for instance, the bill includes an extra fee of $1,000 for the "administrative" cost of making the arrangement, that may be considered an illegal "brokering" fee.  If you're making a surrogacy contract, watch out for unspecified fees. If you later have a dispute over your contract, the entire thing could be invalidated and you could also be charged with a crime.</P>

<P><B>What rights does a surrogate mother have if she changes her mind and wants to keep the baby?</B><BR>
There's no set answer to this question, since there is not a lot of established law on these issues. The Baby M case is considered the leading case in such matters, so many courts would probably be guided by that decision in which the surrogate mother (who wanted to keep the baby) was given visitation rights, but not allowed to have custody of the child.  If the surrogate mother changes her mind anytime before the adoption has been finalized, it is very possible that she will win, at the very least, the right to visit the child. Whether she would be able to win custody of the child is another question, since the biological father also has rights. If the baby had been living with the biological father and his wife for some time, the bonding that will have taken place is something that would be considered when determining custody and visitation arrangements.  If the biological mother does win custody, the biological father would still be entitled to visit the child. He would also be required to pay child support.</P>

<P><B>What happens if the couple splits up before the surrogate gives birth?</B><BR>
The biological father has certain unavoidable obligations to the child, and if its biological mother (the surrogate) followed through on the agreement and surrendered her parental rights, the father would have to take the child himself. Since his wife is not the biological mother of the child, and since she most likely did not have a caretaker relationship with the child during the marriage (since they split before the child was born) it is highly unlikely that she would have any rights whatsoever where the child was concerned. If the surrogate mother surrenders her parental rights, but the father is unable or unwilling to care for the child alone, he can always choose to give the child up for adoption.</P>

<P><B>Does a sperm donor have any rights or obligations to "his" baby?</B><BR>
Yes, technically, as the biological father of the child, he would have the right to visit the child as well as the obligation to support it. However, when a child is born to a married woman, it is automatically presumed in most states that the woman's husband is the child's biological father. Of course, a blood typing test or DNA analysis could prove that he is not the father, but as long as no one challenged the assumption, he would be considered the father of the child.</P>

<P><B>So, should they have a contract?</B><BR>
Yes. A written contract would be helpful in preventing future misunderstandings. The contract should state the purposes of the agreement (why they are doing what they are doing), and it should explicitly state whether or not the biological father is to have any rights or obligations to the child. Both the mother and the father should be represented by separate attorneys to ensure that they both fully understand exactly what is happening.  Note: If you deal with a sperm bank, the donor, who typically is anonymous, will have no obligations to the child.</P>

<H2>Medicare and Medigap</H2>

<P>Legal news you can use excerpted from The Court TV Cradle-to-Grave Legal Survival Guide, an easy-to-read, in depth explanation of the law as it affects all aspects of daily life. You can order the book, published by Little Brown and Company, from our <a href=/store/>online store </a>. It also is available in local bookstores, or you can call Little, Brown directly at (800) 333-3476.</P>

<P><B>What is Medicare?</B><BR>
Medicare is a national health insurance program for seniors and people with disabilities, regardless of income. Anyone over 65 who is eligible for Social Security or Railroad Retirement Benefits -- a program similar to Social Security for railroad employees, their spouses and survivors -- is automatically eligible. People with disabilities who have received Social Security Disability Income for at least 24 months and some people who are receiving regular dialysis or have received a kidney transplant because of kidney failure are also automatically eligible. U. S. citizens are automatically eligible as are permanent legal residents who have been continuously residing in the United States for at least five years, though they must file an application.</P>

<P>The Medicare program is administered by private health insurance companies who contract with the federal government to process claims.</P>

<P>The Medicare program is divided into two sections. Part A is hospital insurance that covers hospital care as well as skilled nursing facility, hospice and home health care. Part B is medical insurance that covers physicians' fees, therapy services, ambulance services, laboratory tests, supplies and durable medical equipment, such as a wheelchair.</P>

<P><B>Part A Benefits</B><BR>
Anyone eligible for Social Security or Railroad Retirement Benefits are eligible for Medicare Part A benefits free of charge. Others may be eligible for Medicare if they pay a monthly premium. (In 1994 it ranged between $184 and $245 per month.)</P>

<P>Part A benefits include:
<UL TYPE=DISC>
<P>	<LI>Hospital Benefits: Entitle you to 90 days of in-hospital care for each "benefit period." A benefit period begins when you enter the hospital and ends after you have been out of the hospital (or skilled nursing facility) for at least 60 continuous days. There is a deductible for each benefit period ($696 in 1994). In addition, you have to pay a "co-insurance amount" for days 61 through 90 ($174 per day in 1994). After you have exhausted your 90 days of coverage, Medicare will pay for an additional 60 days of care in your lifetime. You will have to pay a portion during these "reserve" days ($348 per day in 1994). For additional hospital coverage, you can purchase a Medigap policy (see below).</P>

<P>	<LI>Skilled Nursing Facility Benefits: Entitle you to 100 days of care in a Medicare-certified skilled nursing facility (SNF) per benefit period, provided you were hospitalized for at least three days during the 30 days prior to admission in the SNF and that you need and receive daily skilled services. Medicare defines "daily" as seven days a week of skilled nursing and five days a week of skilled therapy. Skilled nursing and therapy services include evaluation and management as well as observation and assessment of a patient's condition. Medicare pays for the first 20 days in full. For days 21 through 100, you pay a portion ($87 per day in 1994).</P>

<P>	<LI>Home Health Benefits: Medicare covers up to 35 hours a week of home health aide and skilled nursing services if you are homebound and require skilled services on an intermittent basis. Skilled nursing services include the administration of medication, tube feedings, catheter changes and wound care. Intermittent usually means less than five days per week, but some people who receive home health care services up to seven days a week will be covered if the services are only needed for a finite and predictable amount of time.</P>

<P>You can also qualify for up to 35 hours per week of home health aide services if you are homebound and need skilled physical, speech or occuaptional therapy.</P>

<P>You must receive any of these services from a Medicare-certified Home Health Agency (CHHA) in order to be covered. Medicare home health coverage is available indefinitely so long as you remain homebound and continue to require skilled nursing services on an intermittent basis or skilled therapy services.</P>

<P>There is no prior hospitalization requirement and the benefit covers individuals with chronic illnesses as well as those who are acutely ill. The benefit is available at no cost to you, and there is no deductible or co-insurance required.</P>

<LI>Hospice Benefits: Available to terminally ill patients. Medicare will cover 95 percent of the cost of hospice care, and you will have to pay the remaining five percent. Once you elect Medicare hospice benefits, you become ineligible to receive benefits for hospital care related to your terminal illness.
</UL>

<P><B>Part B Benefits</B><BR>
Medicare Part B covers most reasonable and necessary medical services. You can receive this coverage once you turn 65, but you must pay a monthly premium ($41.40 in 1994). If you wait to enroll in Part B until you are older than 65, your monthly premium may be higher, since Medicare imposes a ten percent premium penalty for every year you delay enrollment. However, if you are working and are covered under your employer's group health plan, you may delay enrolling without a penalty until seven months after your retirement.</P>

<P>Medicare sets "approved charges" for all of the medical services it covers. A very important thing to know is that Medicare does not cover many common health expenses, such as prescription drugs, routine checkups, vision and hearing care, custodial care, dental care. It also does not cover experimental procedures. Medicare does cover biannual mammograms and triannual pap smears as well as flu vaccines.</P>

<P>With Part B you must pay an annual deductible ($100 in 1994), and after that, Medicare generally will pay 80 percent of its approved charge for your medical care. Unfortunately, many health care providers charge substantially more than Medicare's approved charge for their services, and you must pay for any charges that are above the approved Medicare rate, which can get expensive. For example, there is no limit on what ambulance companies and durable medical equipment suppliers may charge you. The Medicare-approved portion may represent only a small part of your bill.</P>

<P>Some health care providers, however, "take assignment," which means that they agree to accept Medicare's approved charge as payment in full. Medicare pays eighty percent of the approved charge, and you pay the remaining twenty percent. Your local Medicare carrier has a directory that lists all doctors and suppliers in your area who always take assignment. If you want to limit the amount you pay for medical expenses, it is a good idea to obtain a copy of this directory and use it when choosing your health care providers.</P>

<P>Even when doctors don't "take assignment" federal law limits the amount that they may charge Medicare patients. The limit is 15 percent above Medicare's approved charge. Some states, including Massachusetts, Minnesota, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Connecticut, Vermont and New York, have stricter limits.</P>

<P><B>Are all doctors required to accept medicare patients?</B><BR>
No. Doctors are not required either to treat Medicare patients or to "take assignment" (accept the fees established by Medicare). But federal law prohibits doctors from charging Medicare patients more than 15 percent above the Medicare-approved charge. Some states have even stricter limits.</P>

<P>Even if your doctor charges more than the Medicare-approved charge, he or she must still submit a claim to Medicare on your behalf (and cannot charge you for this service). Medicare will pay you 80 percent of its approved charge, and you will be responsible for the rest of the doctor's bill up to the applicable federal or state limit.</P>

<P><B>Can hospitals turn away Medicare patients?</B><BR>
Hospitals cannot refuse patients on the ground that their health coverage is through Part A of Medicare. Remember, though, not all hospital stays or services are covered by Medicare. It is the hospital's responsibility to inform you if something is not covered.</P>

<P><B>Is a person who has health insurance through an employer also eligible for Medicare?</B><BR>
Yes. Medicare is the primary payer if your employer has less than 20 employees. It's the secondary payer if your employer has 20 or more employees and provides group health insurance. In fact, because it's free, you should sign up for Part A once you are eligible, whether or not you have other insurance.</P>

<P>However, it may not be cost-effective to sign up for Part B if you already are covered under an employer group health plan. That's because you will have to pay Medicare's Part B monthly premium and annual deductible, and your returns will be limited. For example, if your ambulance company charges $150 and your employer plan approves $100 and pays $80 (80 percent of the approved charge), the most Medicare will pay is $20.</P>

<P><B>What is Medigap?</B><BR>
Medigap is insurance that supplements the basic coverage provided under Medicare and pays for health care costs that Medicare does not pay for -- such as deductibles and co-insurance. There are ten variations of Medigap plans available through private insurance companies. The basic benefits offered under all plans include:
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>hospital co-insurance. 
	<LI>full coverage for 365 additional hospital days (to be used after exhaustion of Medicare hospital reserve days.) 
	<LI>twenty percent co-payment for physician and other Part B services.
	<LI>three pints of blood.
</UL>

<P>There are a number of additional benefits available depending upon the plan you select. These benefits include:
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>coverage of the Medicare hospital deductible.
	<LI>skilled nursing facility daily co-insurance.
	<LI>coverage of the Part B $100 deductible.
	<LI>eighty percent of emergency medical costs outside the U.S. during the first two months of a trip.
	<LI>payment to cover the difference when a doctor's fees are over the Medicare-approved charge.
	<LI>at-home custodial care in addition to and in conjunction with Medicare-approved home care.
	<LI>some prescription drug coverage.
	<LI>some preventive medical care coverage.
</UL>

<P>There are many services a Medigap plan will not cover. These include:
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>custodial care -- such as feeding, bathing and grooming -- either at home or in a nursing home.
	<LI>long-term skilled care in a nursing home.
	<LI>unlimited prescription drugs.
	<LI>vision care.
	<LI>dental care.
	<LI>private nurses.
</UL>

<P>If Medicare does not cover your medical care because it is unreasonable and unnecessary or experimental, Medigap will not cover it either.</P>

<P>If you can afford it, and you do not have employer retiree insurance or other insurance to supplement Medicare, Medigap is a good option. If, however, you retire but retain health insurance coverage from your employer, you may be covered for most services. The combination of Medicare and retiree insurance might be more complete than what you receive through a Medigap policy.</P>

<P>It may be wise to stay in your employer's health plan after retirement, if that is an option, since any new insurance plans (including Medigap) may exclude pre-existing health problems for up to six months. If you do opt to enroll in a Medigap plan, it's usually best to do so during the six months following your enrollment in Medicare Part B. During that period, insurance companies must let you sign up for the plan of your choice, without regard to your health or age.</P>

<P>Once you select a Medigap policy, you have 30 days to review the plan and cancel it without penalty. You also are allowed to change or cancel your policy once a year, although in most states your insurer can reject your application for more comprehensive coverage. However, if you wish to downgrade your policy, you may do so.</P>

<P><B>What should you do if your Medicare claim is denied?</B><BR>
For Part A (hospital) coverage, the hospital or Medicare review board must inform you in writing if your stay will not (or will no longer) be covered by Medicare. The denial notice you receive will tell you how to have the denial reconsidered. Many denials are overturned.</P>

<P>If your claim is reconsidered but you are still unhappy, you can appeal again. A large number of appeals are successful.</P>

<P>If your Part B claim is denied, you will receive an "Explanation of Medicare Benefits." You then have six months to ask for the denial to be overturned. If you are rejected again, you have six months to request a hearing through your local Medicare carrier. If your claim is again denied, you have 60 days to request a hearing before an administrative law judge. Many Part B appeals are successful.</P>

<P>It's not necessary to have a lawyer, but if the issue is especially complex it may be helpful.</P>

<H2>Pensions and Retirement Plans</H2>

<P>Legal news you can use excerpted from The Court TV Cradle-to-Grave Legal Survival Guide, an easy-to-read, in depth explanation of the law as it affects all aspects of daily life. You can order the book, published by Little Brown and Company, from our online store . It also is available in local bookstores, or you can call Little, Brown directly at (800) 333-3476.</P>

<P><B>What is a pension plan?</B><BR>
A pension plan is an employer's program for providing retirement income to eligible employees. Employers are not required to provide a pension plan, but if they do, the plan must meet certain requirements. Pension plans offered by private, (non-government), employers are governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and by the Internal Revenue Code. ERISA covers all employer-sponsored pension plans except when the employer is a church or the federal, state or local government. Plans sponsored by these entities are regulated by the Internal Revenue Code. Plans sponsored by state and local government are also subject to state law.</P>

<P>If you work for a private employer that offers a retirement plan, you must be provided with a summary of the plan that describes, in clear, non-legal terms, the substantive provisions of the plan. Among other things, the summary should outline:
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>who's eligible to participate.
	<LI>how benefits are determined.
	<LI>the age at which you can start receiving benefits.
	<LI>who administers the plan.
	<LI>claims procedures.
</UL>

<P><B>What are the different types of pension plans?</B><BR>
Generally, there are two basic types of pension plans: defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans.</P>

<P>In a defined benefit plan, the plan specifies how much in benefits the plan will pay out to a retiree. The defined benefit usually is calculated using a formula based on a percentage of your final compensation multiplied by the number of years you work for your employer. With this type of plan, you should be able to estimate from the start of your employment what your ultimate pension benefit will be.</P>

<P>Your employer is required to fund a defined benefit plan adequately so it will provide the promised benefits when you and other employees retire. You do not have any input into how the money in the defined benefit plan is invested.</P>

<P>In a defined contribution plan (also referred to as an individual account plan), the employer pays a specified amount of money each year, which is then divided among the individual accounts of each participating employee. Your retirement benefit is the balance of your individual account when you retire.</P>

<P>The amount the employer puts in varies, depending on the type of defined contribution plan. It can be:
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>based on the discretion of your employer.
	<LI>a fixed dollar amount.
	<LI>a percentage of your compensation.
</UL>

<P>There are a wide variety of defined contribution plans, including:
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Profit-sharing plans, in which the employer contributes a portion of each year's profit to the plan.
	<LI>Employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs), in which the employer's contribution is made in the form of company stock.
	<LI>401(k) plans, in which each employee may elect to defer a portion of his or her income and place the money in an individual pension account. In some 401(k) plans, the employer also contributes to the employee's individual account.
</UL>

<P>Some defined contribution plans allow you to choose how your money is invested. Some do not. The value of your individual account at retirement will depend upon the amount of annual contributions, plus investment gains or losses.</P>

<P>Each plan has its own rules regarding employee eligibility to participate and the formula used for determining benefits. According to federal law, the eligibility rules must allow for participation by a broad group of workers, and the benefits formula cannot discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees.</P>

<P><B>What does vesting mean?</B><BR>
Often the money your employer pays into a retirement plan may not automatically be yours if you have not yet worked the company for a specified number of years. To be "fully vested" means that you have a nonforfeitable right to all of your pension benefit, even though payment of the benefit may not be made until some later date. (Any of your own contributions to your plan, such as through 401(k) deductions from your salary, are automatically yours.)</P>

<P>Each plan varies, but it often takes between five and seven years of service with your employer to become fully vested. If you leave the company or retire after becoming fully vested, all of your pension benefit is still yours. If you leave before becoming fully vested, you lose the unvested portion.</P>

<P><B>If a person quits a job before reaching retirement age, is the pension lost?</B><BR>
Not if you are vested. However, payment may be delayed until you reach retirement age. Also, you usually can be forced to withdraw your pension benefit money if you quit and your benefit is $3500 or less.</P>

<P><B>Is it possible to withdraw pension money before retirement?</B><BR>
If you participate in a defined benefit plan, it is unlikely that you can gain access to your pension money before retirement. If you are in a a defined contribution plan, such as a profit sharing, 401(k), or stock bonus plan, you may be able to:
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>take a loan from the plan.
	<LI>make a regular withdrawal, if the plan permits.
	<LI>make a "hardship withdrawal."
</UL>

<P>A "hardship withdrawal" is limited to situations in which you have an immediate and heavy financial need. A plan may permit a hardship withdrawal for medical expenses, purchase of a principal residence or tuition for dependents.</P>

<P>You also may be able to receive pension payments before normal retirement age through early retirement, disability retirement, or by taking a series of equal periodic payments based on your life expectancy.</P>

<P><B>Is there a penalty for early withdrawal?</B><BR>
Not if you take a loan. If you take either a hardship or a regular withdrawal, however, you do have to pay federal income taxes. You may also have to pay state and local income tax. In addition, if you are under age 59, there is an additional 10 percent federal tax on the amount of the withdrawal.</P>

<P><B>How are pension payments made when you are married?</B><BR>
If you are married at the time you start receiving your pension benefits, ERISA requires that they automatically be paid in the form of a joint and survivor annuity unless you and your spouse sign a statement electing a different form of payment. That's a rule developed to protect non-working spouses from losing all pension income after a retiree's death.</P>

<P>With a joint and survivor annuity, you (the participant in the pension plan) get a check every month. After your death, your spouse (the non-participant) continues to get a monthly check equal to one-half of the benefit for the rest of his or her life.</P>

<P>Alternatively, you can elect to receive a lump-sum payment or a single life annuity with which you get a monthly check from the time you retire until you die. The monthly payment of a joint and survivor annuity is less than the monthly payment of a single life annuity. This is because the same pension benefit must be divided over two lifetimes instead of only one. The amount of the reduction will vary depending on your age and your spouse's age.</P>

<P>When both you and your spouse work, you each are entitled to share in the other's pension.</P>

<P><B>Is pension fund money protected?</B><BR>
Yes, in several ways. The funds must be held separately from any other company accounts and may not be used for an employer's business purposes. The funds are managed by a fiduciary, a person, committee or company with a legal duty to act prudently and for the sole benefit of the fund. The fiduciary usually has the authority to invest the plan's assets just like any other portfolio of assets. However, under ERISA a fiduciary must diversify the plan's investments and must avoid high-risk investments. If the fund is mismanaged or embezzled, you and any other employees can sue the fiduciary. If you win, the award will be paid to the pension plan, not to you.</P>

<P>Since pension funds are held separately from an employer's assets, such funds are protected if the employer enters bankruptcy. In addition, the federal Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) guarantees payment of vested retirement benefits under most defined benefit plans in certain situations, such as a company's bankruptcy. (Defined contribution plans do not get this protection.) However, benefits above a set level are not insured, so you could lose part of your pension, particularly if you had a high salary or worked for the company for many years.</P>

<P>For any kind of plan, you are supposed to receive an annual report summarizing the status of the plan. While interpreting these reports can be a challenge, some warning signs of potential problems include a sudden huge loss in investment earnings or an employer's failure to make any contributions to the plan.</P>

<P>If you are concerned about the security of your pension, you may wish to contact a lawyer or the Department of Labor. ERISA also prohibits an employer from discharging an employee for the purpose of preventing the employee from receiving a pension. If this happens to you, you may file suit in federal court. You will have to prove that interference with your pension rights was a motivating factor for the discharge. Your potential recovery includes lost wages and benefits, plus attorneys' fees.</P>

<P><B>Is health insurance part of a pension plan?</B><BR>
No. Federal law does not require an employer to offer post-retirement health benefits. Health benefits (for employees and retirees) are generally provided by health plans that are separate from pension plans. If you work for a private employer (not the government), a promise to keep you on the health plan after retirement is probably unenforceable unless it's stated in the official document outlining your company's health plan. If your employer offers a retiree health insurance program, you should consult the written description of the plan to see whether it specifies that you only will receive coverage for a limited period of time or whether the employer has reserved the right to change or terminate the coverage after your retirement.</P>

<P><B>What should you do if you're not getting the retirement benefits you think you're entitled to?</B><BR>
Federal law (ERISA) usually requires that you first file a claim for benefits according to the procedure described in the summary of your pension plan. If your claim is denied, the plan will outline how to appeal. If you have followed all the specified procedures and are still unhappy, you may then sue in federal or state court. You should consult a lawyer to help you do that.</P>

<P>Note: Some courts have limited the evidence and arguments you can present to those you raised during the administrative claims process. Therefore, you may also want to consult a lawyer to help ensure that you are informed of all the arguments you should make during that process.</P>

<P><B>What is a 401(k) plan</B>?<BR>
A 401(k) plan is a "defined contribution" retirement plan set up by an employer for its employees. It allows eligible employees to have a portion of their compensation contributed directly to the plan instead of being paid to them in their paychecks. The employer may match all or part of the employees' contributions. The amount deposited in the plan is not taxed for federal or state income tax purposes, (except in Pennsylvania, where the contribution is subject to state income tax) until it is later withdrawn from the plan. The investment earnings on the savings are not taxed either until you withdraw from the plan.</P>

<P>Each plan has its own guidelines about when you can withdraw. The general rule is that you begin taking money out when you retire. The money is also paid out if you die and, in some plans, if you become disabled.</P>

<P>You may defer paying tax on certain withdrawals from a 401(k) plan if you "roll over" (transfer) the money directly to an IRA or another qualified pension plan. This is what you would do, for example, if you change jobs or get laid off. Otherwise, you generally pay federal income tax on any withdrawal from a 401(k) plan, unless your withdrawal is made as a loan (which is taxed only if you fail to repay it.) If you make a withdrawal before reaching age 59, you will have to pay a 10 percent federal penalty tax.</P>

<P><B>What is an IRA?</B><BR>
An IRA (individual retirement account), is a type of account that earns investment income and allows you to defer paying tax on that income. Anyone who earns money can contribute annually to an IRA account, and many people qualify to deduct the contribution from their income taxes. Even if your company has a pension plan, you can still make an IRA contribution, but it won't be tax deductible.</P>

<P>Most banks, insurance companies, mutual fund companies, brokerage houses, and other financial institutions offer IRAs. Individuals can contribute $2,000 or 100 percent of their taxable compensation (whichever is less) each year to an IRA. Compensation includes wages, salaries, tips, commissions, fees, bonuses, taxable alimony and spousal maintenance payments. If your taxable income is $1,800, you can put all of it into an IRA; if it is $18,000, you can only invest $2,000 in the IRA.</P>

<P><B>What are the rules about IRA withdrawals?</B><BR>
You are allowed to withdraw money from your IRA at any time. However, if you do so before turning age 59, you have to pay a 10 percent federal penalty tax. You will also have to pay income tax if your contributions were tax-deductible. If you have paid income tax on the money you contribute to the IRA, then the only tax you will have to pay on withdrawal is on the amount of investment income earned. That tax must be paid whenever you make a withdrawal, no matter what your age. You must begin to receive payments from your IRA by April 1st of the year after the year in which you reach age 70. If you choose not to receive payments then, you will be assessed a penalty tax equal to 50 percent of your minimum withdrawal amount.</P>

<P><B>Can a person contribute to an IRA for a spouse who doesn't work?</B><BR>
Yes, within limits. You can open a separate IRA for your spouse if he or she is under age 70 and if you file a joint Federal income tax return. The total combined contribution you can make each year to your IRA and your spouse's IRA is $2,250, or your entire taxable income for the year, whichever is less. You can divide the contribution between the two IRAs any way you want, so long as you don't contribute more than $2,000 to either one.</P>

<P><B>What is a Keogh plan?</B><BR>
A Keogh plan (sometimes called an "H.R. 10" plan) is a retirement plan that covers one or more self-employed individuals. A self-employed individual is a person who declares income from self-employment for federal income tax purposes. This income is known as "earned income." You can be an employee of one business and also have earned income from a self-employed business.</P>

<P>Some Keogh plans cover self-employed individuals who are considered "owner-employees." An "owner-employee" is either:
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>the sole owner of an unincorporated business.
	<LI>a partner in a business who owns more than 10 percent of the partnership.
</UL>

<P>Any Keogh plan that covers owner-employees must also cover non-owner employees. And it must be democratic. The plan cannot provide the owner with contributions or benefits that are more favorable than those provided for the employees. The amount you can contribute varies, depending on how the plan is set up. The withdrawal rules and penalties are the same as for an IRA.</P>

<P><B>What is a SEP?</B><BR>
SEP stands for "simplified employee pension." It is a special kind of pension plan that your employer can provide or that can be established by a self-employed person. With a SEP, your employer contributes money directly into an IRA that you establish yourself or that your employer helps you establish. You can contribute more to a SEP than to a regular IRA. The annual maximum is $30,000 or 15 percent of your earnings, whichever is lower. The withdrawal rules are the same as for an IRA.</P>

<H2>Social Security</H2>

<P>Legal news you can use excerpted from The Court TV Cradle-to-Grave Legal Survival Guide, an easy-to-read, in depth explanation of the law as it affects all aspects of daily life. You can order the book, published by Little Brown and Company, from our <a href=/store/>online store </a>. It also is available in local bookstores, or you can call Little, Brown directly at (800) 333-3476.</P>

<P><B>What is social security?</B><BR>
What we know simply as "Social Security" is more formally called Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance (OASDI) under Title II of the Social Security Act. It is a national program created by Congress, which pays money to retirees, survivors of deceased workers, and people who have become disabled.</P>

<P>While there are different types of benefits under the program, when most people refer to Social Security they are talking about money paid to older workers or retirees who have made contributions to the program from their earned income. Most employees are required to contribute, though some state and local government workers are exempt.</P>

<P>Social Security can seem like a nightmarish bureaucracy with a complicated morass of regulations and lots of indecipherable terminology. But basically it works like this: while you are working you are required to give a portion of every paycheck to the Social Security Administration, the federal agency that runs the program. When you retire--or if you should become unable to work--the Social Security Administration pays you. Broadly, the system is meant to work like a pension plan. While you work, you put money into the plan; when you retire, you take money out.</P>

<P><B>Who is eligible to collect social security benefits?</B><BR>
You become eligible to collect Social Security benefits based on your history of contributions to the program. You may choose to begin receiving benefits as early as age 62 or as late as age 70. The age at which you begin to receive benefits and the amount of your contributions over your working years will affect the size of your monthly benefit. You may also be eligible to collect benefits if you become disabled.</P>

<P><B>Can a person still work and collect?</B><BR>
Yes. But for workers under age 70 who have chosen to begin receiving benefits, there are limits to the amount of income you can earn in any year without reducing your benefits. (In 1992 it was $7,740 for workers under 65 and $10,200 for workers between 65 and 69.) Income earned above these limits will reduce your benefits by one dollar for every two dollars you earn if you are under 65, and by one dollar for every three dollars you earn if you are 65 to 69. After you reach age 70, earning income does not reduce your benefits.</P>

<P><B>How are benefits calculated?</B><BR>
The level of Social Security you get is based on how much you have paid into the program at the time you begin receiving benefits.</P>

<P>Anyone who has worked for 40 "quarters" since 1951 is likely to be covered by the program. You will be considered to have worked four quarters in a calendar year as long as you earned a certain amount in that year. For example, in 1992 each $570 you earned represented a credit for a quarter; thus, if you earned at least $2,280 (4 x $570), you received credit for 4 quarters. Even if you earned the $2,280 all in one month and didn't earn anything for the rest of the year, you still get the credit. You cannot, however, get credit for more than four quarters per calendar year.</P>

<P>If you reached age 62 before 1991, you may qualify for the program even if your "earnings record" calculated by the SSA shows you have less than 40 covered quarters.</P>

<P>Does early retirement affect a person's ability to collect social security?
No. You can still begin collecting benefits starting at age 62, provided your earnings record shows that you worked at least 40 quarters.</P>

<P><B>Is it possible to verify your earnings record?</B><BR>
Yes. It is a good idea to review your earnings record every few years to make sure it is accurate. You can do so by filing Form SSA-7004 with one of the three national Social Security offices. The form can be obtained by calling Social Security at 1-800-772-1213, or your local Social Security district office, and you can return it in the mail. It usually takes six to eight weeks to get a response, and if you think it's in error you can appeal through your local Social Security office.</P>

<P>You are only "taxed" on your earnings up to a set amount each year (it was $55,000 in 1992). Anything you earn in excess of that maximum will not increase your benefits. Your earnings record will reflect only the amount you have earned up to the maximum of each year.</P>

<P><B>Can a person draw a pension and still collect social security?</B><BR>
Yes. Social Security is considered to be a basic source of income for workers in their retirement years. The amount of benefits is generally unaffected by other pension benefits. However, some government employees may receive less Social Security, depending on the kind of retirement plan they have.</P>

<P><B>Is social security income taxable?</B><BR>
Yes. Depending on your other sources of income, you may have to pay federal income tax on up to one-half of your Social Security benefits. You may also have to pay state taxes. If your income is below a set level, however, you will not have to pay taxes on your Social Security. To find out whether you need to pay taxes, you can call the Social Security Administration or the Internal Revenue Service.</P>

<P>Note: While the government can tax your Social Security, that income is shielded from your creditors -- the people to whom you owe money.</P>

<P><B>Are unemployed spouses able to collect social security benefits?</B><BR>
Yes. Even a spouse who never worked is entitled to Social Security. If both of you are over 65 when your benefits begin, your spouse may be entitled to receive an additional amount equal to 50 percent of your benefit. So, if you get $100, your spouse gets an additional $50, for a total of $150 between the two of you. However, the amount of your spouse's benefit may be less if you or your spouse receives a federal, state, or local government pension.</P>

<P>Your spouse may begin receiving payments as early as age 62, provided you are also receiving benefits at that time. If you have reached age 65 and are receiving benefits, but your spouse is between ages 62 and 65, your spouse's benefits will be something less than 50 percent of yours, reflecting the discount applicable to the early commencement (before age 65) of your spouse's benefits.</P>

<P><B>What happens if both spouses worked?</B><BR>
Each spouse either collects his or her own benefits or his or her share of the other spouse's benefits, depending on which is higher.</P>

<P><B>When are children entitled to collect social security benefits?</B><BR>
A child can receive Social Security benefits after a retired parent begins receiving them if the child is unmarried and legally dependent on the parent for his or her needs. These benefits are generally available to children under 18 (19 if still in high school) and children of any age with severe disabilities, so long as they were disabled before reaching age 22. The amount of a child's benefit is usually fifty percent of your benefit, but since there is a limit on the total amount of benefits one family can collect, the amount per child may be less. A child is also eligible to receive benefits if the parent dies or becomes disabled.</P>

<P><B>What happens to the benefits if a person dies?</B><BR>
Upon your death, and even if you were not receiving benefits at the time of your death, each member of your family who meets certain requirements will be entitled to survivor's benefits. Those eligible include:
<UL><LI>a spouse who has reached age 60.
<LI>a spouse who is caring for a child who is under age 16 or who became disabled before reaching age 22.
<LI>a disabled spouse who has reached age 50 and is unable to perform any substantial, gainful activity.
<LI>a disabled child who became disabled before reaching age 22.
<LI>an unmarried dependent child under age 18 (or under age 19 if a full-time student in a high school program.)
<LI>parents of the deceased worker who have reached aged 62 if the worker was paying at least half of the parents' support.</UL>

<P>There is a limit to how much one family can collect; it varies, depending on the size of the family.</P>

<P><B>Can someone younger than 62 collect social security benefits?</B><BR>
Yes. People 62 and older can collect retirement benefits, but if health reasons cause you to stop working at any time before your 65th birthday, you may be eligible for Social Security Disability Insurance Benefits (SSDIB). To collect these benefits you will need to prove two things:
<UL><LI>that you meet the Social Security standard for disability.
<LI>that you are "insured" because you have worked the required number of quarters for a person your age and contributed to Social Security.</UL>

<P>To determine if your disability qualifies you for Social Security Disability benefits, usually a state agency that handles health issues (often called Disability Determination Services, or DDS) must find that you are suffering from a physical or mental impairment that meets the Social Security Administration's criteria. First, the DDS determines if your impairment prevents you from participating in "any substantial gainful activity." Your condition must have lasted a full year or be expected to last a full year or be expected to result in your death within a year.</P>

<P>You will be found "not disabled" if you are working and earning over $500 per month or if your impairment is found "not severe." You may also be found not disabled if you still have the ability to work -- even if it's not at the same job.</P>

<P>If the government rules that you are disabled, benefits can start as early as five months after you become disabled. (You may be entitled to retroactive benefits for up to one year, depending on how much time elapses between the onset of your disability and when you file an application.) The typical benefit is between $150 and $1500 a month.</P>

<P>If you want to appeal a denial of benefits, you should do so promptly, since you usually have only 60 days to appeal. An explanation of how to appeal will be provided with your denial notice, or you can visit any Social Security office.</P>

<P>Is a person entitled to a share of an ex-spouse's social security benefits?
Yes. A former spouse age 62 or older who is not remarried can receive Social Security benefits if the marriage lasted more than 10 years. Former spouses decide on their own when to start receiving benefits after reaching age 62, so long as the divorce occurred more than two years before the benefits begin. When the worker spouse retires, dies or becomes disabled, a former spouse can often receive monthly benefits equal to 50 percent of what the worker spouse receives. Even if you both worked, you are still eligible to collect your share of your ex-spouse's benefits.</P>

<P><B>Can a person be designated to receive a family member's social security benefits for them?</B><BR>
Yes. You may ask the Social Security Administration to make you a "representative payee." The appointment will be granted if your family member approves or if you can show that your relative is legally incompetent, or mentally or physically incapable of managing his or her benefits.</P>

<P>While any friend or "custodial institution," such as a nursing home, can be designated as "representative payee," the Social Security Administration prefers to appoint relatives who have a "strong concern" for the beneficiary. The "representative payee" may pay all your bills with the Social Security funds, and if there is any left over, it must be saved for you. It does not belong to the representative payee.</P>

<P><B>What is supplemental security income?</B><BR>
Supplemental Security Income (SSI) is a federal welfare program for adults and children with disabilities and people aged 65 and over with low income and few financial resources (like bank accounts, stocks and bonds). You don't have to qualify for Social Security benefits in order to get SSI, and it is possible to get both Social Security and SSI. However, if you're applying based on a disability, you must meet the same standard for disability as with regular Social Security benefits.</P>

<P>People who qualify for SSI receive a check each month, though the amount will vary depending on the recipient's state of residence and level of income. (In New York, a person living at home could get as much as $532 a month in 1994.) If you qualify for SSI, you are also automatically entitled to health care coverage under the Medicaid program.</P>

<P>You usually can apply for SSI and Medicaid by completing forms provided by your local welfare office, department of social services or Social Security Administration office. If the application is approved, you will be paid benefits based on the date you filed the application. If your application is not approved, you can appeal. The procedure is similar to appealing for more Social Security benefits.</P>

<P><B>What should a person do if he or she is denied benefits?</B><BR>
If you are not satisfied with your benefits, you have 60 days to submit a written request for a reconsideration. The request should be sent to your local Social Security district office (which should be listed in your local phone book), and should state the reasons why you disagree with the determination. Depending on the nature of the issue, either a case review, a formal conference or a hearing may follow.</P>

<P>If you fail to appeal a determination within 60 days, your options are limited unless you can show you had a good reason for filing late. If you can't, you may be able to file a new application and seek retroactive collection of benefits. You can also try to reopen the claim by filing a petition with a judge who is specially designated to hear Social Security appeals.</P>

<P>It's not necessary to have a lawyer when making an appeal. However, there are lawyers available who handle these type of cases, and if you don't have much money you may be able to get assistance from a legal services organization that won't charge you anything.</P>

<H2>Wills and Trusts: The Basics</H2>

<P>Legal news you can use excerpted from The Court TV Cradle-to-Grave Legal Survival Guide, an easy-to-read, in depth explanation of the law as it affects all aspects of daily life. You can order the book, published by Little Brown and Company, from our <a href="/store/">online store</a>. It also is available in local bookstores, or you can call Little, Brown directly at (800) 333-3476.</P>

<P><B>Who should make a will?</B><BR>
The vast majority of Americans die without wills, and the consequences vary greatly with individual circumstances. Every adult should think about making a will, and the need grows as your assets and family ties increase. Wills are especially crucial for parents with children who are minors (under 18 in most states), since you can name a guardian in a will and make arrangements for financial support of children even past the age of 18.</P>

<P>Couples also have each other to think about. If your spouse dies without a will, state law might force you to split the assets of the estate (the deceased's property) with your children, leaving you without enough assets to support yourself. Also, any property going to a minor child in such a situation would be subject to an expensive court-appointed guardianship, which could eat up any inheritance.</P>

<P><B>Aren't there some people who really don't need to worry about drafting a will?</B><BR>
Yes. If you are single, with few assets, you probably don't need one. And if you care about who would get something (such as a car) if you die, you could make the item joint property by naming a co-owner on the deed or title. That person would get full ownership of the item upon your death. The potential downside of this is that you are giving the co-owner an interest in that property for life, and you may not be able to change your mind. Financial accounts can also be jointly held and will pass directly to anyone you name. Without this kind of planning, your possessions will go to your closest heirs, probably your parents or siblings--which may or may not suit you.</P>

<P><B>What happens if a person dies without a will?</B><BR>
If you die without a will--that is, intestate--state laws determine how your property will be distributed among your heirs, or closest relatives with the right to inherit. As a rule, the surviving spouse gets half the estate and any children divide the other half. Grandchildren would be next in line, followed by parents, siblings, and other relatives of the deceased. If a person dies without a will and without any traceable heirs, all property goes to the state.</P>

<P><B>What is the process if there is no will?</B><BR>
The estate is legally in limbo until the state appoints an administrator (usually an heir) who must make sure there is no will, and notify all heirs they are in line to inherit. The administrator performs many of the functions of an executor--he or she pays debts and taxes, and accounts for and distributes the money to the heirs. If there is no family member who is able to act, a state will appoint a public trustee or administrator to do the job.</P>

<P><B>Is a lawyer necessary for drafting a will?</B><BR>
The simple answer is that wills made without lawyers can be legally sound if the proper procedures--especially those governing witnesses--are followed. The books and computer software on the market can guide you on issues you might want to address and on proper procedures. For people with relatively simple estates a do-it-yourself will may work fine.</P>

<P>That said, we don't recommend doing without a lawyer. Just making a valid will won't insure that your exact intentions will be carried out. This area of the law--called estate law--has many wrinkles and complexities, often arising from variations in state law. There are many potential pitfalls, particularly when jointly owned property or spouse's inheritance rights are involved. Even with small estates, you can best make sure that your property will be disposed of according to your wishes by consulting an attorney.</P>

<P><B>Can someone who is senile or incapacitated write a will?</B><BR>
As a general rule, a valid will can't be made by a person whose mind has deteriorated to the point of not knowing who his or her family is or what property he or she owns. The same is true for a person who is physically incapable of communicating. The best way to protect such a person's assets is to have him or her declared "incompetent" in a special proceeding.</P>

<P><B>Can a person leave money to a pet?</B><BR>
An animal-lover cannot make a bequest to a pet, or set up a trust in its name. But he or she can set up a trust for someone who will care for the pet, or bequeath money to the animal's caretaker in a will.</P>

<P><B>Can bequests be conditional on a person doing--or not doing--something?</B><BR>
Yes, but courts look at bequests such as these and decide whether following them would violate "public policy"--things the court thinks the state wants to foster or discourage. It's likely that a requirement that someone marry a Catholic would be upheld, since that probably wouldn't be seen as a significant restraint on the ability to marry (marriage tends to be seen as good public policy)--though you never know until the court decides. But a will provision that requires someone to divorce a present spouse or remain unmarried would probably be deemed unenforceable.</P>

<P><B>Why might people want to change their wills?</B><BR>
There are many reasons for changing a will--the birth or death of beneficiaries, the death of the named executor or guardian, or changes in the property you own. Some people have petty or vindictive reasons for changing a will, or may want to cut someone out of a will after a falling out. And sometimes people simply change their minds.</P>

<P><B>What's the best way to change a will?</B><BR>
The best way is to make a new will, even if changes are slight, and to make sure it clearly states that all previous wills are invalid. While you can change just one part of a will with a document called a codicil--an amendment which must be signed and witnessed just like a will--this kind of shortcut can pose problems. If a person has his will bequest reduced or eliminated by a codicil, he usually gets court notice of this, which can lead to hurt feelings and, sometimes, a will contest.</P>

<P><B>Is it advisable to have a lawyer to make a change in a will?</B><BR>
Yes, because the changes made by a codicil have to be carefully integrated with the will. Also, you might want advice about whether an entirely new will is needed.</P>

<P><B>How many witnesses are necessary?</B><BR>
Nearly all states require that there be at least two witnesses, but some states require three, so, if in doubt, use three. Though a witness must be an adult, it's best to choose ones who are young enough that they are likely to be alive when the will goes through probate. Many states require all witnesses to be present when the will is signed. Even in states where this is not required, it is safer to do it this way to prevent problems in probate. Also, it's best to chose disinterested witnesses--people who won't get anything under the will. Using an interested witness won't invalidate the will, but the witness won't be allowed to take anything under it.</P>

<P><B>Do wills have to be notarized?</B><BR>
Usually not. Proper witnessing is the important thing. However, in order to avoid the cumbersome process of requiring the executor to track down the witnesses, many states, including New York and New Jersey, allow self-proving wills: wills accompanied by a sworn statement from witnesses, signed before a notary public. Acceptance of these sworn statements--or affidavits--is not automatic, and the probate court is more likely to respect them if the will execution was supervised by an attorney.</P>

<P>If the will is challenged, witnesses may be called into court to testify as to whether the testator (the person who wrote the will) signed the will voluntarily, understood what was being signed, declared the document to be his or her will, and asked the witnesses to sign. Recently people have been videotaping themselves as they sign their wills, which may provide additional evidence of their competence. However, this is not a legal requirement--nor is it a legal substitute for witnesses. If a will is made with no witnesses (even if you videotape it), it will be declared invalid in almost every case.</P>

<P>A few states allow unwitnessed handwritten documents, called holographic wills, to be admitted to probate, but this a very risky course, since almost all courts will be very reluctant to accept them.</P>

<P><B>Where should original wills be kept?</B><BR>
You can leave your original will on file in your lawyer's office, with the clear understanding that you are free to remove it at any time. Law offices often have vaults for safe document storage. Some lawyers may urge keeping the will in their office to further the chance that they will be selected when it comes time to submit the will to probate. But even after the testator's death, the executor, and not the attorney who drafted the will, is in control, and can pick whomever he or she wishes to act as counsel for the estate.</P>

<P>If you don't leave your will with your attorney, the original should be kept in a safe place, though not in your safe deposit box, because these are sometimes sealed when a person dies.</P>

<P><B>Is it ok to have photocopies of wills?</B><BR>
It may be useful to have a photocopy of your will, so you don't have to go to the trouble of getting the original out of safe storage. It's best to write "COPY" clearly on any photocopy and to leave copies unsigned, so there's no confusion with the original.</P>

<P><B>What are the essentials that make a will valid?</B><BR>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>The will must be in written form. A videotape recording of your wishes won't do.
	<LI>It must be signed by the person making the will.
	<LI>It must be signed by two (or, in a few states, three) competent witnesses.
	<LI>The will-maker, or testator, must be competent--not insane, senile, or mentally disabled--and not acting under duress or under the controlling influence of another person.
</UL>

<P>Other things, while not vital, would be wise to have in almost any will:
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>A clause revoking all previous wills.
	<LI>Names of all beneficiaries (people to whom you wish to leave property), along with what you wish to leave them, and who gets the property if that beneficiary dies before you. Another term for beneficiary is legatee.
	<LI>If you have minor children, the name of a guardian for them if your spouse does not survive you, and, if need be, a guardian or a person to manage the child's assets.
	<LI>The name of an executor (sometimes called a personal representative) and, if needed, trustees for any trusts created by the will.
	<LI>A statement naming a residuary legatee for the residue of the estate. The residue is the portion of the estate left after bequests of specific items of property are made. In fact, the residuary estate is often the largest portion of the estate, and the person or people who get it are those the deceased intended to get the most. The executor may also use the residuary estate pay fees and taxes.
	<LI>A statement eliminating bonds. Many states require executors and trustees to post a bond (usually paid out of estate funds) to guarantee that they complete the job properly. You can save them this expense by stating that no bond is needed.

<H2>The Trust Option</H2>

<P>Legal news you can use excerpted from The Court TV Cradle-to-Grave Legal Survival Guide, an easy-to-read, in depth explanation of the law as it affects all aspects of daily life. You can order the book, published by Little Brown and Company, from our <a href=/store/>online store </a>. It also is available in local bookstores, or you can call Little, Brown directly at (800) 333-3476.</P>

<P><B>What is a trust?</B><BR>
A trust is property given to a trustee to manage for the benefit of a third person. Generally the beneficiary gets a "trust income," the interest and dividends on the trust assets, for a period of years. After a certain time specified in the trust (say the beneficiary's turning 25) the trust "terminates." At this point the beneficary gets the remainder of the principal (whatever hasn't been paid out during the life of the trust).</P>

<P>There are two main kinds of trust: those created by provisions in wills, called testamentary trusts (as in last will and testament), and those created during the maker's lifetime, called living trusts. Some living trusts are set up so that they can be changed during the grantor's lifetime, but others are set up so that they can't be touched. The first kind of living trust is called "revocable," the second is called "irrevocable." There are major tax law differences between each type, and people setting up trusts should be sure they understand the tax consequences, which can be very complicated.</P>

<P><B>How can a couple use a trust to save on estate taxes?</B><BR>
Couples with combined estates of more than $600,000 may want to consider a bypass trust, also known as a marital life estate or an A-B trust. A spouse can leave any amount of property to a surviving spouse totally free of estate tax. But when the surviving spouse dies, if his or her estate is worth more than $600,000, significant estate taxes will be due. A bypass trust is designed to let the $600,000 exemption be used by each spouse. But bypass trusts aren't for everyone, particularly for younger couples. And setting up and administering these trusts can be tricky, so anyone considering it should discuss it in detail with a lawyer.</P>

<P><B>Can a trust protect assets from a child's creditors?</B><BR>
Generally, yes. If you think your child could have problems with creditors, you should give the trustee broad discretion to withhold income and principal from the child.</P>

<P>Let's say your 25-year-old son goes into default, after your death, for $40,000 in college and law school loans, and you have left him a trust worth $50,000. You could have set up the trust as a spendthrift trust, which is designed to keep the money out of the hands of creditors. The sum in the trust will generally be safe from the banks, though creditors can collect from any money paid directly to your son from the trust. To be fully effective, a spendthrift trust must be irrevocable, it must last for the entire lifetime of the beneficiary, and it must give the trustee full discretion over the assets of the trust.</P>

<P><B>Is a lawyer necessary to set up a trust?</B><BR>
Most trusts should be drawn up with the help of a lawyer or financial manager. Because there are so many issues to consider, with so many weighty consequences if things go wrong, it is a situation in which expertise is really needed.</P>

<P>The only exception is the totten trust, which allows you to go to a bank and open an account yourself, while naming a beneficiary. A totten trust is best for amounts of about $20,000 or less--larger amounts could present problems in payment of estate tax at your death, since the assets in these accounts are added to you taxable estate. A totten trust can be paid out quickly after your death with a minimum of formalities. Because the money transfers directly, there's no need for choosing a third-party trustee, and the advantages are the same as with any other trust--you keep those assets out of  probate.You can revoke a totten trust at any time during your life, and the beneficiary can't take out the money until you die.</P>

<P><B>Who should be selected as a trustee?</B><BR>
Many people choose relatives or close friends, though institutions--banks or trust companies--also provide this service. Often a person selected as a minor child's guardian is also named a trustee of any trusts established for the child--but there is no requirement that these be the same people.</P>

<P>State law often sets commissions for trustees, but different rates can be specified in a trust, and institutions usually get paid commissions under their regularly published fee schedules. Friends and relatives often waive commissions.</P>

<P><B>Why set up a trust?</B><BR>
There are many reasons, but some of the more common are as follows:

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>to manage assets during the lifetime of the person creating the trust, and to pass them on to chosen beneficiaries without probate (often done through revocable living trusts).
	<LI>to manage assets for a child until he or she reaches a certain age. The trustee can use the income or principal as he or she sees fit to pay for the child's needs, such as college.
	<LI>to manage assets for an adult who is incapable of handling them.
	<LI>to attempt to shield assets from creditors through irrevocable and spendthrift trusts.
	<LI>to manage assets for a surviving spouse while holding property for the children of a prior marriage.
	<LI>as a way to reduce estate taxes for couples with estates of over $600,000.

<H2> Probate</H2>

<P>Legal news you can use excerpted from The Court TV Cradle-to-Grave Legal Survival Guide, an easy-to-read, in depth explanation of the law as it affects all aspects of daily life. You can order the book, published by Little Brown and Company, from our <a href=/store/>online store </a>. It also is available in local bookstores, or you can call Little, Brown directly at (800) 333-3476.</P>

<P><B>What is probate?</B><BR>
Probate is the legal process in which a court oversees the distribution of property left in a will. The estates of people who die intestate, or without a will, also go through probate.</P>

<P>Time-consuming and often frustrating and costly, probate has gotten bad press ever since Charles Dicken's 19th century novel <I>Bleak House,</I>  and it truly can eat away at the assets of an estate and the patience of those who may be heirs or beneficiaries under a will. There are a number of books on the market giving advice on how to avoid probate, and it may be wise to do some planning of this sort. Also many people, knowingly or not, already structure their finances so that significant assets will pass to others outside of probate process: A jointly-owned house, for example, will pass directly to the survivor, and life insurance proceeds can go directly to a named beneficiary. Technically, the only property subject to probate is that for which there is no other legal mechanism for shifting title to a new owner.</P>

<P>Despite the possibilities of probate avoidance, it's still advisable to consider a will. As noted, a will lets you set up a guardian for your minor children and for their property. You may also want to use a will as a kind of backstop to other estate planning. For example, even if you try to make sure that none of the property you own will pass through probate, a will can handle assets that you may not be able to plan for, such as an inheritance, lottery winnings, or a personal injury settlement (any of which could enter your estate after you die). Also, imagine a situation in which a husband dies and his wife gets all of his estate because they owned everything jointly. Nothing may pass through probate then, but when the wife dies she may well need a will if she wants to direct who gets her property.</P>

<P><B>Steps in the probate process:</B><BR>
<OL TYPE=1 START="1">
	<LI>Someone dies.
	<LI>Someone, often the person named in the will as executor or personal representative, files the will with the probate court, usually in the county where the deceased lived.
	<LI>The executor inventories all assets and liabilities of the estate.
	<LI>The executor signs the petition for probate, a document summarizing the will's provisions and naming the heirs--relatives who would stand to inherit if there were no will.
	<LI>The executor may have to locate the witnesses and file sworn statements from them--or even have them testify--to affirm that they witnessed the signing of the will. This step can be avoided in some states if the witnesses sign a notarized affidavit at the time the will is signed.
	<LI>The executor sends a formal legal notice telling each heir and beneficiary that the will has been offered for probate. (The executor may hire an attorney, at the estate's expense, to file papers and represent the estate in court.)
	<LI>After this step, anyone wishing to challenge the will may appear in court to do it, either in person or through a lawyer.
	<LI>Assuming no objections are made or upheld, the judge approves (admits) the will and formally appoints the executor. Once this happens it is tough to upset a will, although some states do allow a late challenge under special circumstances.
	<LI>The executor settles all accounts by paying debts and taxes. The executor must provide details to certain beneficiaries -- usually the residuary legatees --about what property the executor received; what was paid in expenses, taxes and other costs; and what was given to each beneficiary.
	<LI>The executor pays out the remaining assets to beneficiaries and makes a final accounting of the estate to the court.
	<LI>The probate judge rules the estate formally closed, or, to save legal fees, the beneficiaries agree to release the executor by written agreement.
</OL>

<P><B>How long does probate take?</B><BR>
When the will involves an estate that is small (generally less than $20,000, although it varies from state to state), it can be handled in a faster and less formal process known as "summary administration" or "small estates" procedure. To find out whether that route is an option, check with your local probate court clerk.</P>

<P>For most estates, however, the process can take many months, even when there are no objections to the will and the estate is uncomplicated. If the estate is large, or there are significant problems, such as estate tax controversies or an attempt to challenge the will, it can take years.</P>

<P><B>Is there anyway to bypass probate?</B><BR>
Yes. There are several methods. Some are simple because they usually involve comparatively small amounts, and can be set up without lawyers. Others, involving larger sums, may have unexpected costs and consequences. You may want to see a lawyer to determine which of these methods are appropriate.</P>

<P>Avoiding probate has its limitations. It doesn't fill the urgent need to provide for minor children by naming guardians, which generally can only be done through a will or other formal document recognized by the state. Moreover, some methods for bypassing probate may deny you access to your property while you are alive and bar you from changing your mind, as you always can with a will, and they may prove to be more expensive than going through probate.</P>

<P>Another warning: Avoiding probate won't automatically make you exempt from creditors or from taxes. The popular trust form called the revocable living trust allows you to change or cancel it, but has the disadvantage of leaving your beneficary open to creditors. Depending on the size of your estate, federal and state taxes will still be levied on most assets. A bereaved spouse can keep some of your assets out of the hands of creditors, but you'll stand a chance of protecting all your assets from creditors only if they are placed in the right kind of airtight, irrevocable trust.</P>

<P><B>Do retirement and insurance accounts go through probate?</B><BR>
It depends. When you set up these accounts or buy the insurance, the financial institution will ask you to name a beneficiary, which could include your estate, in which case the assets would go through probate. If you don't name your estate as beneficiary, the named beneficiary would get the funds directly--outside of probate--upon your death.</P>

<P>If you are single, you are free to name whomever you want as a beneficiary. Married people, in contrast, are required to name their surviving spouse as beneficiary of any pension or profit-sharing plan. Under the Retirement Equity Act of 1984, the spouse must receive the funds unless he or she has signed a statement consenting to the designation of someone else. These funds also do not pass through probate.</P>

<P>If a couple with minor children name each other as the principal beneficiaries, they may want to name thier estates as secondary beneficiaries. This is because they may have set up trusts in their wills to hold assets for their children, and, in the event that they both die, they would want proceeds of life insurance or retirement accounts to pass into those trusts. But a smarter solution in this case--one that would avoid having the funds pass through probate--would be for the couple to set up children's trusts outside of their wills, and direct that life insurance proceeds be paid directly to those trusts.</P>

<P><B>Ways to bypass probate</B><BR>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>You can give all your property away before you die, but you may have to pay a stiff gift tax. And once you give something away, you can't be assured that you'll get it back if you change your mind.
	<LI>You can hold your property jointly with another person so it goes to him or her automatically upon your death. If you are married, joint property transferred to persons other than your spouse could be affected by state laws governing inheritance between marriage partners, referred to as spousal rights. As with gifts, once you make property jointly owned, you may not be able to get your share back if you change your mind.
	<LI>You can set up trusts that will be paid upon your death to any person you name. A trust is property given to a trustee--a friend, relative, or business adviser chosen by the person setting up the trust--to manage for the benefit of someone else. A popular form is the revocable living trust, which the person who sets it up (called the grantor) can change or revoke while still living. At death, the trustee pays the deceased's debts, taxes, and expenses, including the trustee's fee and the costs of maintaining trust property and then turns over the balance of the property to the beneficiary.
</UL>

<P>The revocable living trust was popularized in the best-selling book by the late Norman Dacey, How to Avoid Probate!. However, this kind of trust is not a panacea. In order to avoid probate, title to all the property in the trust must be held by the trustee, which can be cumbersome and time-consuming to achieve.</P>

<P>In general, trusts are not simple or foolproof. They often require a lawyer to set up, and are subject to estate taxes if the assets exceed $600,000. Since they can be costly, they are best for larger estates--with the exception of trusts established for minor children.</P>

<P>For moderate amounts, you can set up a special bank account that requires no trustees, and transfers to the designated person upon your death. Called a totten trust, it is a simple and inexpensive way for those with smaller estates to bypass probate.</P>

<H2>Property Distribution</H2>

<P>Legal news you can use excerpted from The Court TV Cradle-to-Grave Legal Survival Guide, an easy-to-read, in depth explanation of the law as it affects all aspects of daily life. You can order the book, published by Little Brown and Company, from our <A HREF=/STORE/>online store </A>. It also is available in local bookstores, or you can call Little, Brown directly at (800) 333-3476.</P>

<P><B>What are the different forms of property ownership, and how do they affect rights to leave property in a will?</B><BR>
Anyone, married or unmarried, may be a co-owner of certain possessions, and this co-ownership can limit your right to give something away in your will. Read the fine print on your deeds and titles. When two or more co-owners are named on the document, and it states that the property is held in joint tenancy, then the asset--whether it's money in a bank account, a car, or a house--will go directly to the surviving owner or owners upon your death--even if the deceased tries to give his interest to someone else in his will. That's because a joint tenancy automatically carries what is known as a right of survivorship. If the property is held this way by spouses, it will usually pass to the survivor free of gift or estate tax. (Joint tenancy has been abolished or restricted in Alaska, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Texas, and anyone thinking of using a joint tenancy in one of these states should consult a lawyer.)</P>

<P>Tenancy in common, on the other hand, allows you to sell your share or leave it in a will without the consent of the others. If you die without a will, your share goes not to the other owners, but to your heirs.</P>

<P>It's important to remember that either form of ownership can sometimes be overridden by community property laws and other forms of spousal rights. In other words, when Gordon's brother Jim dies, Jim's widow might be able to claim an interest in the beach house, though she's not named in the will or on any deed.</P>

<P><B>If two brothers own a vacation house together, can one of them leave his share to his children?</B><BR>
Yes, if the deed shows they are "tenants-in-common," but not if they are "joint tenants with rights of survivorship."</P>

<P><B>If one brother leaves his share to his children, what options does the surviving brother have if he doesn't want to share the house with his niece and nephew? Could they force him out of the house?</B><BR>
If the brothers did not come to terms before one of them died, the surviving brother would have little choice but to try and buy out his nieces and nephews--or be bought out by them. If they can't agree on a price, the matter could end up in court as an action for partition: if the property can't be physically divided, it is sold to the highest bidder and the proceeds are divided among the owners. In this sense, the niece and nephew can force the remaining brother out of the house, and vice-versa.</P>

<P>This sticky family situation could have been avoided by some advance planning by the two brothers when they bought the house. They could have chosen to set up a buy-sell agreement, under which the surviving brother gets the right to buy the other's half-interest at either a preset price, or a price determined by an appraiser. Or the two brothers could have worked out a time share arrangement, or a similar plan, allowing the surviving brother's family to use the house.</P>

<P><B>What's the best way for a parent to divide possessions among children?</B><BR>
There are several ways to divide up your tangible personal property, which is anything other than real estate or money, and includes such things as furniture, cars, jewelry, china, and so on. You can:
<UL><LI>Itemize your bequests in your will, naming who gets each item.
<LI>Leave your personal possessions outright and in equal shares to your children.
<LI>File a memorandum with your will with instructions on how your possessions should be divided. Many states will recognize it as legally binding; in the states that don't, the memo will still (you hope) carry moral weight with your children. Such a memo can also contain information useful for finding or using your assets, such as the location of car keys, or other small items. The advantage of such a memo, is that you can change it without all the formality necessary when modifying your will.
<LI>If you think your children may not see eye to eye on the value of your things, or on what makes an equal share, you can give your executor authority to decide which child gets which item. (With this method, don't name one of your children your executor!)
<LI>Direct your children in your will to choose items in sequence. If you think they might argue over who gets first choice, direct them to draw lots to decide who chooses first, second, and so on.</UL>

<P><B>What happens if a person forgets to designate certain assets?</B><BR>
Typically, a will contains a clause saying something like, "I give my car to Henry, my boat to Ellen, and the balance of my tangible personal property to George." In that case, George gets any items which haven't been given away under more specific provisions. If the will doesn't have such a general clause, the items go to the person named as residuary legatee.</P>

<P><B>What's the best way to leave items of different value to children or others without offending anyone?</B><BR>
Leave additional cash to the person getting the item of lesser value. (You probably only need to think about this if there is a significant difference in value.)</P>

<P><B>What happens to bequests to people who die before the person who writes the will?</B><BR>
It depends on what the will says. As noted, it's always a good idea when writing a will to name alternative beneficiaries. This and other key phrases can guide an executor to, in effect, fulfill a deceased's plan B if plan A doesn't work. Basically, though, they direct that a bequest to a predeceasing beneficiary pass to his or her heirs.</P>

<P><B>What happens if property left in a will no longer exists?</B><BR>
That's probably tough luck for the person named as the beneficiary. In most cases, he or she would get nothing.</P>

<P><B>What happens if there is less (or more) money to be divided among heirs than at the time a will was written?</B><BR>
It is almost certain that the value of financial accounts will change over time, and thus can't be specified in a will. You can deal with this two ways. First, you could have a specific amount set aside for one person, and have the balance go into the residuary estate to be divided according to other directions you leave. Or, you can specify how much each person will get. In that case, the funds will be distributed proportionately.</P>

<H2>Leaving Property To A Minor</H2>

<P>Legal news you can use excerpted from The Court TV Cradle-to-Grave Legal Survival Guide, an easy-to-read, in depth explanation of the law as it affects all aspects of daily life. You can order the book, published by Little Brown and Company, from our <a href=/store/>online store </a>. It also is available in local bookstores, or you can call Little, Brown directly at (800) 333-3476.</P>

<P><B>What's the best way to leave property to a minor?</B><BR>
You and your spouse can leave property to a minor directly by a bequest in your wills--but if you die before the child is grown, he or she will not be able to take the money directly. The law would require the creation of a court-supervised guardianship. While the judge will likely appoint a competent adult family member as property guardian, the judge may also have the power to appoint an outside lawyer to administer it. That could cost your child a lot of money, because a court-supervised guardian is entitled to fees from the minor's estate. Even a family member who doesn't take fees would have to file frequent accountings with the court and be subject to strict supervision over how funds are spent -- which may require the assistance of a lawyer and an accountant. When the child turns 18, the guardian must give him or her the money.</P>

<P>If you name a property guardian, it's a good idea if it's the same person who is your child's personal guardian, and your alternate choices should match as well. Having separate people handle these functions is fraught with potential for conflict.</P>

<P>Given the many drawbacks of using a property guardian, there are two other ways of leaving property to children that should be considered. One is to leave property to a child under the Uniform Transfers to Minors Act. This act, which has been adopted in most, though not all, states, lets you appoint a custodian who has broad authority to manage and dispense funds for your child without constricting court supervision and accounting requirements. A child receives the balance of the funds at anywhere from ages 18 to 25, depending on the version of the UTMA adopted by your state.</P>

<P>A UTMA custodianship works particularly well for relatively small amounts of money--$50,000 or less. Amounts above that leave open the possibility that a child could end up receiving a large chunk of money at a relatively young age. That may not sit well with you if you want to assure that someone will oversee your child's finances through the time he or she is in colleg, or if your child needs special care of some kind.</P>

<P>In this case, the option you may turn to is a trust, which in this case would be called a children's trust. You select a trustee and give him or her broad authority to use both income and, if necessary, principal from the trust assets to provide for your child's living expenses, health care, and education. You also specify the age at which the child gets control of the trust propety. As with a UTMA transfer, there is no court supervision. However, trust income may be taxed at a significantly higher rate than income in a UTMA account. A children's trust can be set up as part of your will, or outside it.</P>

<P><B>What's the best way to choose a guardian?</B><BR>
Two concerns arise in providing for minor children after your death. The first is who will take custody of the children and provide for their care and upbringing--what is known as a personal guardian. The second issue involves the best method for providing and administering financial support for your children.</P>

<P>In the event of the death of a biological or adoptive parent, it is almost certain that the surviving parent will retain sole custody of minor children, unless that parent is proved to be unfit or incompetent--because of problems with alcohol or crime, for example. The real issue when thinking about selecting a child's personal guardian is who to name in the event both parents die. In selecting a personal guardian, you should choose the person you think will do the best job, of course, but it should be someone the court will find capable of taking proper care of the child. Courts usually give most weight to the selections made by the last surviving parent in his or her will, but a judge's duty is to serve "the best interests of the child," not the desires of the deceased parents.</P>

<P>Still, if two parents have been involved in raising a child, a court may look to the guardian named in each parent's will, and it's best if that is the same person. Other things a court would consider include how much contact the person has had with the child, what kind of resources he or she has to take care of the child, and what his or her ideas are about such things as education and upbringing. A step-parent has no special rights to custody, though he or she might be named guardian if both natural parents die.</P>

<P>You should ask the person you're thinking of in advance whether he or she agrees to take on such a responsibility. It's also important to name an alternate personal guardian, in case your first choice is unable or unwilling to serve. And finally, even if you think of having another couple serve as guardians, it's best to name only one member of the couple, to avoid problems in the event that couple splits up.</P>

<P><B>What happens to a child who is born after a will is made in the event the parents die?</B><BR>
Most states have "afterborn child" laws that permit children to receive bequests if they were born after a will was signed, as long as the will makes provisions for the children who had been born at the time it was executed. The afterborn child typically gets the same portion of the estate as his or her siblings.</P>

<P>A good way around this potential problem is to avoid using specific names of children when dividing up the residuary estate. Instead, you can leave it to "all my children, in equal parts." (An old-fashioned term for children used in some wills is "issue.")</P>

<P><B>What inheritance rights do adopted children have?</B><BR>
Most states have passed laws giving adopted children the same inheritance rights as natural children, with minor exceptions. Usually, adopted children have no right to inherit from their natural parents, though of course the natural parents might decide to leave them something in their will.</P>

These are the transcripts of nine of the first ten days of O.J. Simpson's deposition in the civil lawsuit brought against him by the families of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman. (The tenth transcript, dealing with Simpson's finances, is sealed). This is the first time Simpson has answered questions under oath about his activities just before, during and after the murders.</P>

Robert Kardashian, who read O.J. Simpson's letter defending himself and thanking friends after the Bronco chase, refused to answer key questions. He said he has acted as one of Simpson's attorneys since 1970 and many of the conversations he has had with his friend are protected under attorney-client privilege.</P>

<P><B>Lawrence Schiller Deposition</B><BR>
(<A HREF="schiller.html">Veiw the Deposition</A>) -- (<A HREF="schiller.zip">Download Zip File</A>)<BR>
Writer, director and producer Lawrence Schiller visited O.J. Simpson 16 times at the Los Angeles County Jail in November and December of 1994. A former neighbor who once directed Simpson in a music video, Schiller gained access to Simpson as a possible material witness in the criminal trial. But those visits were primarily used to produce, "I Want to Tell You," a book in which Simpson answers letters from the public and proclaims his innocence. Royalties from the book, which received a $1 million advance, were paid to Simpson's legal defense fund. In this June 7, 1996 deposition, lawyers for the family of Ronald Goldman asked about the 30 hours of interviews recorded in producing the book.</P>

<P><B>Jason Simpson Deposition</B><BR>
(<A HREF="jason.html">View the Deposition</A>) -- (<A HREF="jason.zip">Download Zip File</A>)<BR>
Jason Simpson, O.J. Simpson's son from his first marriage, denied in this May 8, 1996 deposition that his father engaged in domestic violence. But at one point in the criminal trial, considering the prosecution's evidence, he recalled, "the thought crossed [his] mind" that his father might be responsible for Nicole Brown Simpson's death. Simpson said he never questioned his father about the murders. But he said he is confident that his father is innocent.</P>

Kimberly Goldman described her brother, Ronald, as having played a central role in raising her, in this Feb. 5, 1996 deposition. After her parents split up, he helped take care of her when her father was at work. Defense lawyers probed Goldman for her family's motivations in bringing wrongful death charges against O.J. Simpson. Goldman said she was shocked that her mother filed a suit because Ronald hadn't seen the woman in more than 15 years before his death.</P>

Allen Cowlings, O.J. Simpson's longtime friend, asserted his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination throughout his deposition, taken April 16, 17 & 26, and May 15, 1996. "Why don't you just give me immunity, and I can answer these questions for you," Cowlings told the plaintiffs' lawyers. Two months later, Judge Alan Haber denied granting Cowlings limited immunity against prosecution. Cowlings finished his deposition on May 15. Judge Haber's ruling means that Cowlings does not have to answer further questions in a deposition.</P>

Cora Fischman, a friend of the Simpsons, claimed she was unaware of most of the abuse Nicole Brown Simpson said she suffered in her diary. Fischman said that at the time of her death, Nicole was leading a "dangerous life" that involved drugs. Fischman claimed that Nicole's friends threatened to ostracize her if she did not say that O.J. was responsible for Nicole's murder.</P>

In his three-day deposition, taken February 14, 15 & 20, 1996, Brian "Kato" Kaelin talked about his relationship with O.J. Simpson and Nicole Brown Simpson, the couple's violent relationship, and events leading up to the murders. Simpson was angry with his former wife for "playing hardball" with him in granting access to their children, Kato recalled, and was in an extremely bad mood shortly before his former wife and Ronald Goldman were murdered. When Simpson and Kaelin went to McDonald's that evening, the conversation was so strained that he felt awkward about asking Simpson for a straw, Kaelin said.</P>

From physical beatings to psychological torture, O.J. Simpson was obsessed with controlling his former wife, according to Faye Resnick in her deposition, taken February 10-12, 1996. Along with death threats, Simpson terrorized her by reporting her to the IRS, she said. She describes O.J. Simpson as a drug-abusing wife beater, playing the part of star athlete in public. But when he got angry with his wife, "His jaw would protrude, his teeth would clench, sweat would come pouring from his head," she said. "The only way to describe it is animalistic."</P>

<H2>The Case of Mumia Abu-Jamal</H2>

<P><A HREF="discuss.html"><B>"Fair or Foul? The Case of Mumia Abu-Jamal"</B></A><BR>
Harvard law professor Arthur Miller hosts a panel discussion about the issues raised by the case of Mumia Abu-Jamal. Miller and his guests address police misconduct, what it takes for a defendant to get a new trial, the death penalty, and other issues. This Court TV special was first broadcast on July 11, 1996.</P>

<P><A HREF="analysis.html"><B>Jamal's Last Stand</B></A><BR>
Infamous murder case may be significant test of new habeas statute. Stuart Taylor Jr. examines how the case of Mumia Abu-Jamal stands as an example of the need for federal courts to remain open to new evidence, even after seemingly intolerable delays in carrying out the sentence of a defendant who was convicted in 1982 of murdering a police officer.</P>

<P><B><A HREF="npr.html">Mumia Abu-Jamal Sues NPR, Claiming Censorship</A></B><BR>
Mumia Abu-Jamal, a nationally-known journalist serving a death sentence for the murder of a Philadelphia police officer, says National Public Radio violated his First Amendment rights. In a civil lawsuit filed in federal court,the former radio journalist contends that NPR decided not to run a recorded broadcast of his death-row commentary for the show "All Things Considered" because of political pressure from the Fraternal Order of Police and  U.S. Sen. Robert Dole.</P>

<P><B><A HREF="guilty.html">Guilty and Framed</A></B><BR>
Death row celebrity journalist Mumia Abu-Jamal got an unfair trial before a biased judge. His "confession" was probably fabricated by police, who may have rigged other evidence too. But he is also -- probably -- an unrepentant cop-killer. So what now? Stuart Taylor, Jr. examines the controversial case.</P>

<P>The statements by Thomas Manning, a tire dealer from Junction City, Kan., were among several documents released to the public.</P>

<p>Manning is said to have sold McVeigh the 1977 Mercury Marquis that was allegedly used as the getaway car after the April 19, 1995 bombing. Four days before the blast, McVeigh allegedly left Manning's Firestone dealership and called Nichols and a Ryder rental truck agency.</P>

<P>The government claims the Ryder truck McVeigh rented was used to carry the bomb he and Nichols built that killed 168 people and injured more than 500 others.</P>

<P>U.S. District Judge Richard Matsch set March 31 as the trial date for McVeigh. Nichols' trial date has yet to be set. The defendants could face the death penalty if convicted of federal conspiracy and murder charges. </P>

One of the biggest federal trials ever staged suddenly has been transformed into two of the biggest trials ever. And as the Oklahoma City bombing case moves forward, that transformation not only has implications for each side's legal strategy, but also will touch witnesses, the crime victims and their families, and U.S. taxpayers. </P>



<LI><P><A HREF="reports/blitz.html">No Media Blitz for McVeigh</A><BR>

Accused Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh will not be going on a media blitz before his trial. An Oct. 4 ruling denies McVeigh's motion to be allowed to conduct a series of interviews with hand-picked television and print reporters. </P>



<LI><P><A HREF="reports/septrial.html">Bomb Defendants Want Separate Trials Severance Payoff</A><BR>

With the start of the Oklahoma City bombing trial still months away, prosecutors are facing their most serious challenge to date as they try to fend off the defendants' push for separate trials. </P>



<LI><P><A HREF="reports/okla918.html">Monsters and Boy Scouts</A><BR>

At first blush, accused Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh's pending motion for permission to give media interviews -- including one with a famous TV journalist, to be chosen from a gaggle of eager applicants who have already auditioned for the opportunity -- might seem an occasion for revulsion. But, says Stuart Taylor Jr., the motion should be granted.</P>



<LI><P><A HREF="reports/media.html">McVeigh's Media Bid Tests Inmate Rights</A><BR>

Accused Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh's bid to conduct interviews with a number of hand-picked national reporters is more than just a media strategy--it also raises provocative legal questions about jailed defendants, the First Amendment rights of pretrial detainees, and the role of the press in the trial process.</P>



<LI><P><A HREF="reports/okla94b.html">Joseph Hartzler: Low Key, High Pressure</A><BR>

The top prosecutor in the Oklahoma City bombing case plays a surprisingly quiet role as leader of the DOJ's <A HREF="reports/okla94a.html">'Dream Team'</A>.</P>

<LI><P><A HREF="reports/tigar.html">Nichols' Lawyer: A Tigar's Stripes</A><BR>

Michael Tigar, in an interview after winning an acquittal for Maj. Debra Meeks on charges of sodomy and conduct unbecoming an officer, says he had in mind his representation of one of the men charged with blowing up the Oklahoma City federal building. But he also could have been remembering his early career, when he successfully challenged the Selective Service for putting Vietnam War protesters at the top of its induction lists.</P>



<LI><P><A HREF="reports/troubling.html">More Power to the

Bureau?</A><BR>

Testimony about police behavior in the Oklahoma City case has troubled

many civil libertarians, scholars, and defense lawyers, who warn that

if the FBI played it too close to the line in the Oklahoma City probe,

this may be a taste of things to come.</P>



<LI><P><A HREF="reports/fine.html">Fine-Tuning TV Coverage</A><BR>

In permitting a closed-circuit broadcast of the Oklahoma City bombing

trial, Chief U.S. District Judge Richard Matsch managed both to

satisfy a congressional mandate that the trial be televised and to

address defense attorneys' vocal concerns for their clients' right to a fair trial.</P>



<LI><P><A HREF="reports/redraw.html">Bombing Case Lawyer Redraws Map</A><BR>

Look in any road atlas, and you'll find that Denver is 609 miles from Oklahoma City. But don't tell that to defense lawyer Michael Tigar, who managed to shave more than 300 miles off that distance in a recent court filing in the Oklahoma City bombing case.</P>



<LI><P><A HREF="reports/rethink.html">Rethinking the 5th Amendment</A><BR>

If Timothy McVeigh fails to take the stand at trial, the prosecutor will be barred from commenting on his silence, and the jury will be told not to infer anything from his silence. Is it time to reassess the 5th Amendment?</P>



<LI><P><A HREF="reports/nra.html">The NRA Under the Gun</A><BR>

The bombing accentuated the National Rifle Association's common ground with militias. Should this powerful lobbying group soften its rhetoric?</P>

Welcome to the Critical Incident Response Group. In the wake of the bombings at the World Trade Center and Oklahoma City, this unit is helping the U.S. fight terrorism on its own soil.</P>



<LI><P><A HREF="reports/represent.html">Representing the Accused Bomber</A><BR>

Defense lawyer Stephen Jones, who is representing bombing suspect Timothy McVeigh and has defended controversial people like Abbie Hoffman, says that declining the Oklahoma case would be like "living a lie."</P>



<LI><P><A HREF="reports/toiling.html">Toiling in the Rubble</A><BR>

Federal prosecutors accustomed to assembling their cases in antiseptic offices scrambled to begin a massive investigation in a dank, two-story warehouse whose windows were shattered by the blast.</P>



<LI><P><A HREF="reports/scramble.html">Scrambling to Find a Defender</A><BR>

Timothy McVeigh's first appointed lawyers labored under a sharp conflict of interest that cast serious doubt on whether they could defend McVeigh: Both had lost friends in the bombing.</P>

<H2>The Unabomber Case</H2>

<P><B>Update: </B>Unabomber suspect Theodore J. Kaczynski
pleaded innocent Dec. 10 via video to charges in New Jersey that he sent the mail bomb that killed an advertising executive two years ago.<P>

<P>Kaczynski's plea from California was made through a live hookup
to the federal courthouse, where Judge Dickinson R. Debevoise
presided in a courtroom packed with spectators, journalists and
court workers.</P>

<P>In Sacramento, where Kaczynski has been jailed since early
summer, the U.S. Marshals Service moved Kaczynski to the federal
public defender's office for the cross-country arraignment.</P>

<P>The California trial of Unabomber suspect Theodore Kaczynski on charges of killing two people with four bombs will begin Nov. 12 next year, more than 18 months after his arrest.</P>

<P>Law enforcement officials believe Kaczynski is the Unabomber, the person who killed three people and injured 23 others during an anti-technology bombing campaign between 1978 and 1995. </P>

A federal judge rejects a defense bid to transfer to California the New Jersey case against Theodore Kaczynski, the alleged Unabomber. The judge also rejects a prosecution motion to begin the New Jersey case in June, before the California case, which is scheduled for November.</P>

<LI><P><A HREF="reports/bombshell.html">Kaczynski Prosecutor's Bombshell</A><BR>
Federal prosecutors reveal that Unabomber suspect Theodore Kaczynski allegedly
kept a diary with accounts of his crimes, while the defense claims that the
juicy revelation was made with the media in mind, and worry that it may make it
impossible to get a fair trial in that venue.</P>

<LI><P><A HREF="reports/clarke.html">NACDL President-Elect to Join Kaczynski Defense</A><BR>
Unabomber suspect Theodore Kaczynski's defense team has received a jolt of star power, with the recruitment of Judy Clarke, the incoming president of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers.</P>

A Sacramento federal grand jury issues a 10-count indictment against Theodore Kaczynski that mentions just four of the 16 attacks attributed to the Unabomber. The bare-bones, nine-page indictment packs plenty of punch, however: It covers two of the Unabomber's three murder victims, and employs death penalty statutes that were amended in 1994 with an eye toward withstanding constitutional challenge.</P>

<LI><P><A HREF="reports/complete.html">'Complete Lawyer' in Kaczynski's Corner</A><BR>
The impending indictment of Theodore Kaczynski will thrust Sacramento Federal Public Defender Quin Denvir into the spotlight. As one of California's most respected appellate lawyers, Denvir is no stranger to high-profile cases, from the Billionaire Boys Club murder to former California schools chief William Honig's conflict-of-interest conviction.</P>

<LI><P><A HREF="reports/mulling.html">Mulling the Death Penalty</A><BR>
Justice Department officials have managed to disclose a vast amount of information explaining why they believe Theodore Kaczynski is the Unabomber. But the government has kept quiet on one important question - whether to seek the death penalty in the case.</P>

<H2>The Bosnia War Crimes Tribunal</H2>
<P><I>In the first international war crimes trial since World War Two, Bosnian Serb Dusko Tadic is charged with crimes related to the rape, torture and murder of prisoners in and around three prison camps in northern Bosnia. You can watch highlights of the proceedings weeknights at 6 p.m. Eastern Time on Court TV's "War Crimes on Trial," hosted by anchor Raymond Brown. </I> </P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">Update:</FONT></B><BR>
After 78 days of court, the trial of Dusko Tadic ended Nov. 28. A verdict is not expected until at least January, according to a tribunal spokesperson. On Jan. 8, the trial of Bosnian Croat Tihofil Blaskic is scheduled to begin. Blaskic is accused of leading an attack on Muslim civilians in the Lasva River Valley in central Bosnia in 1993.

<h2>Garcia v. Garcia</h2>
Daily Developments Dec. 11 -- Jan 6<HR>
<P><B>December 11</B><BR>
The Grateful Dead's leader, Jerry Garcia, earned fame and fortune as a musician and clothes designer. But years of drug use, combined with his failing health and bad legal advice, made him unfit to enter into a divorce settlement with his second wife, according to his estate's lawyer, Paul Camera.</P>

<P>But David Phillips, attorney for Carolyn Adams Garcia, Jerry's second wife, claimed that the estate is merely reneging on a legitimate community property settlement.</P>

<P>At the center of this dispute is a 13-line, one-paragraph agreement that Carolyn Adams Garcia said she drafted herself, in which Jerry agreed to pay her $5 million.</P>

<P> Phillips said the agreement is a valid contract, in which Carolyn accepted the payment in exchange for her right, following a 12-year marriage, to an equal division of the couple's community property. But Camera said it was merely a memorandum that was to lead to a formalized settlement that was never reached.</P>

<P>The burden of proof is on Carolyn Adams Garcia to prove the settlement was fair. The estate's burden is to prove the agreement isn't enforceable.</P>

<P><B>Respondent's Opening Statement</B><BR>
Phillips said Jerry Garcia signed an agreement to pay his client $5 million over 20 years, at not less than $250,000 a year. The couple reached this agreement without the assistance of their divorce attorneys and it came about at Garcia's request, he said.</P>

<P>When Garcia filed for divorce in 1990, he agreed to temporary monthly payments of $24,000, and these payments continued until the divorce agreement went into effect in January 1994. At that time, the payments were reduced to about $20,000 a month ($250,000 divided by 12 months), as called for in the settlement agreement. As no time did anyone in Garcia's legal camp object to the payments, which continued until the singer's death in August 1995, Phillips said. </P>

<P>At the time of Garcia's death, he had made 18 payments of $20, 883, apparently in keeping with the terms of the alleged contract, Phillips said.</P>

<P><B>Petitioner's Opening Statement</B><BR>
Garcia was a unique person, an artist who wasn't too concerned with money, Camera said. Garcia was also a product of the drug culture that he so frequently sang about. Years of drug use left him suffering from "hyper-suggestibility," meaning he was an easy mark for his second wife and his lawyer David Hellman, Camera said, suggesting a conspiracy.</P>

<P>Camera said Garcia was addicted to heroin, cocaine, LSD and other drugs. Though he would not go so far as to say Garcia was incompetent when he signed the agreement in 1993, he charged Adams Garcia with being a manipulative opportunist who "bullied" her ex-husband.</P>

<P>In addition to questioning the validity of the couple's divorce settlement, the estate also questioned whether Jerry and Carolyn Adams Garcia were legally wed. Camera claimed that the two agreed to marry merely to give Jerry a tax advantage.</P>

<P>If Adams Garcia was able to take advantage of her husband, it was because she had the help of David Hellman, Garcia's own attorney, Camera said. Hellman, who represented Garcia as an accountant and personal attorney, was a co-executor of Garcia's will. Yet Camera claimed Hellman, who represented Adams Garcia in several matters, had a conflict of interest. </P>

<P><B>December 12</B><BR>
Defendant Carolyn Adams Garcia read to the court a love letter from her late husband to undercut claims that her marriage to Jerry Garcia was a sham.</P>

<P>"You tickle me with your sweet talk. I build up a vision of you on the bed and watch you form the words," Adams Garcia said on the witness stand, reading from the letter, which was printed on hotel stationery, apparently written when Garcia was on tour with his band, the Grateful Dead, in Chicago.</P>

<P>"I sink into you. I worship you . I love you on every level, every way," the letter concludes. It is signed, "Your devoted ugly Jer." </P>

<P>Aside from this emotional moment, most of Adams Garcia's testimony was devoted to describing the community property from her marriage and the alleged settlement agreement between the couple.</P>

<P>As the Grateful Dead's popularity rocketed, so did Garcia's income. He and his wife's joint tax returns from 1981 to 1990 showed their income increased from about $200,000 to more than $2 million a year. Adams Garcia testified that she and her husband had holdings in business, art and music ventures and shared joint bank accounts. Though they lived apart for long stretches, she said she and her husband were devoted to each other. </P>

<P>The witness recounted her on again, off again relationship with Garcia, from when they first lived together in 1967, through their first break-up in 1975 and 1981 marriage. </P>

<P>After the 1975 split, Garcia gave his then-girlfriend the Stinson Beach, Calif. house they lived in with their two children. She and the children later moved to Oregon.</P>

<P>The couple reunited briefly in 1977, when Garcia was supposedly ``hiding out'' after a fight with Deborah Koons -- who later became his third wife and widow. In 1980, while Adams Garcia was attending college in Massachusetts, she and Garcia began spending more time together. Each time his two bands -- the Jerry Garcia Band and the Grateful Dead -- passed through the state, she joined the tours. In Christmas of 1981, Jerry and Carolyn Adams Garcia and their children formed a household again. They married on Dec. 31, 1981, backstage at the Oakland Coliseum Arena after a concert. </P>

<P>Though Adams Garcia testified that she and Jerry intended to buy a house together in Marin County in the spring of 1982, his difficulties with the IRS led him to decide to hold off. As the tax trouble dragged on, she said she returned to Oregon to allow her daughters to return to school there.</P>

<P>It wasn't until Jerry Garcia fell into a diabetic coma in 1986 that his wife returned to the Bay Area. She remained with him after he recovered. About that time, she became a half-owner of a new company, Consensus Reality Inc., formed to handled his business deals outside the Grateful Dead. </P>

<P>The Garcias separated again in January of 1990, and Jerry agreed to pay Carolyn temporary family support of $24,000 a month until they could reach a settlement. But by the spring of 1993, with no property settlement in sight, Garcia Adams testified that her husband called her, frustrated with the slow pace of the divorce, and asked for a face-to-face meeting. When Adams drafted the $5 million agreement, allegedly at her husband's request, she said her goal was for a simple, honest settlement that would resolve all issues.</P>

<P>On cross-examination, estate attorney Paul Camera tried to point out that the alleged contract's lacked "consideration" -- a legal term for a fair exchange between parties -- and therefore wasn't enforceable. He asked the witness to explain what Jerry Garcia received as a trade-off for the promise to pay $5 million over 20 years. Freedom from her asking for money, she said.</P>

<P>Camera also attacked the alleged contract for its vagueness. He questioned the witness on whether the monthly family support payments of $24,000 was to stop when the agreement went into force. The witness said that that was her "assumption," though it is not specified in the agreement. Camera said the contract also did not mention how the agreement would effect overdue family support. </P>

<P>When Camera pointed out other apparent weaknesses in the agreement, Adams simply replied, ``I tried.''</P>

<P><B>December 13</B><BR>
David Hellman, the lawyer that allegedly betrayed Jerry Garcia, was called as the estate's first witness.</P>

<P>Estate lawyer Paul Camera asked that Hellman be declared a hostile witness. But the judge denied that motion.</P>

<P>Hellman agreed that he could be considered Garcia's ``general counsel.'' Starting in 1974, Hellman handled a variety of legal and accounting work for the rock star. From 1992 to 1995, Garcia granted Hellman power of attorney.</P>

<P>Suggesting that Hellman might have taken advantage of Garcia, Camera asked about the band leader's ``bad drug years.'' Hellman denied the possibility that he exploited his client. `He was lucid and intelligent,'' Hellman said, claiming that Garcia never came into his office high on drugs.</P>

<P>But Hellman admitted that he was closely involved in his client's personal life. When Jerry Garcia and Carolyn Adams split-up in 1975, after living together for eight years and having two children together, Hellman drafted the agreement in which Adams was given the couple's house in Stinson Beach, Calif., and all its contents, in exchange for no future demand for money. </P>

<P>Camera tried to show the court there was no legal reason for such an agreement. Adams, merely a girlfriend at the time, had no legal claim on any of the property. This settlement was made before the landmark Lee Marvin case in which a live-in partner was granted alimony for the first time. Hellman said he drafted the agreement based on what he was told by Garcia and Garcia's manager.</P>

<P>Hellman flatly denied ever saying that Jerry and Carolyn Adams Garcia married in 1981 purely to ease Garcia's tax problems.</P>

<P>In questioning Hellman about the couple's 1993 settlement agreement, Camera tried to show that Hellman was closely involved in aiding Adams Garcia. Hellman held fast, however, that he simply offered his office to the couple for a meeting, and that he told both that he was not acting as counsel. He said he told both of them to consult divorce attorneys. But Hellman conceded he was present for the entire first meeting in which Jerry asked Carolyn to come up with a proposal of what she wanted in a settlement. </P>

<P>Suggesting that Garcia was eventually unhappy with the settlement and loosing faith in Hellman, Camera pointed out that  Garcia withheld Hellman's power of attorney in 1995 and asked about the possibility of getting the agreement declared null and void.</P>

<P><B>December 16-17</B><BR>
No court.</P>

<P><B>December 18</B><BR>
The estate continued questioning lawyer David Hellman, Jerry Garcia's personal attorney, attempting to show that he had a conflict of interest, resulting in Garcia receiving inadequate legal advice.</P>

<P><B>According to Hellman:</B></P>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI><P>Consensus Reality Inc. -- an entity set up in 1986 to issue salary and pay withholding tax on Garcia's non-income outside of the Grateful Dead  --  was formed with Garcia and Carolyn Adams Garcia as co-owners. Estate lawyer Paul Camera asked Hellman if he advised Jerry he was giving up a significant amount of money to Carolyn, sparking an objection from Phillips. Hellman said he didn't think of it because the two were married. Camera suggested that this move was another example of Hellman favoring Carolyn at Jerry's expense. </P>

<LI><P>Hellman admitted that he inflated values in financial statements he prepared for the couple in conjunction with their application to buy real estate. </P>

<LI><P>Hellman testified that most of Jerry's income earning entities --his company interests and the bands -- were formed before his 1981 marriage to Adams.</P>

<LI><P>He met with Adams Garcia in the early 1980s several times regarding drafts of wills that were never signed. </P>
</UL>

<P><B>December 19</B><BR>
Estate lawyer Paul Camera hammered home his theme that Jerry Garcia's lawyer David Hellman abandoned -- and perhaps conspired against -- the famous guitarist.</P>

<P>Focusing on the May 11, 1993 meeting between Garcia and Carolyn Adams Garcia, in which the $5 million agreement was signed, Camera asked Hellman if he even considered whether Garcia could make the $250,000 a year payments.</P>

<P>Hellman admitted that he reviewed the agreement. But everything happened so quickly, he didn't have time to consider the issue.  He said he didn't advise Garcia to hold off signing it because it wasn't his role. He maintained that he wasn't a divorce lawyer for either party. Both Jerry and Carolyn had divorce lawyers and he assumed they were talking to them.</P>

<P><B>Other highlights:</B></P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI><P>Hellman had frequent one-on-one meetings with Adams Garcia when Garcia wasn't present.</P>

	<LI><P>Hellman didn't advise Jerry Garcia against giving his wife half ownership of Consensus Reality Inc., which brought in income from assets acquired before the couple wed.</P>

	<LI><P>Even though Garcia had legal counsel, he mistakenly believed he had to sign a property settlement before he could remarry.</P>
</UL>


<P><B>December 20</B><BR>
A forensic accounting expert testified that Jerry and Carolyn Adams Garcia's community property hardly justified the $5 million settlement agreement.</P>

<P>Richard Schiller, an expert witness for the estate, valued the couple's community property at $2.1 million. Of that total, Schiller said Adams was due $1.61 million. Considering Adams received bank account funds of $276,000, autos valued at $82,000, and a house valued at $194,000, Carolyn was due $507,000, he said.</P>

<P>Considering that Carolyn has already received $375,00 over 18 payments under the 1993 settlement agreement, Schiller said that Adams received most of what she was due.</P>

<P>On cross examination, Defense lawyer David Phillips pointed out that Schiller did not consider the Grateful Dead's catalog of songs and other assets when making his estimates.</P>


<P><B>December 23</B><BR>
Deborah Koons Garcia testified that her late husband told her early in her relationship that he made "three big mistakes in the last 15 years." Those were: becoming a drug addict, marrying Carolyn Garcia to save on his taxes, and getting involved with Manasha Matheson, the mother of his youngest daughter, nine-year-old Keelin.</P>

<P>The widow, who cut off the $20,883-a-month payments to Carolyn Adams Garcia after the band leader's death, testified that Jerry and Carolyn Adams Garcia's marriage was a sham and that Jerry was trying to revoke the couple's $5 million divorce settlement shortly before his fatal heart attack.</P>

<P>Koons Garcia, 47, described meeting Garcia in 1973 in Long Island, New York, while hitching a ride with the Grateful Dead after a show.  She says they began a correspondence that continued while she traveled in Europe through 1974.  A year later, they moved in together. </P>

<P>They reached a "rocky place" in 1977 and parted. At a chance encounter at a health food store 15 years later, they met again and rekindled their relationship.</P>

<P>Koons Garcia testified that Garcia continued to court her, but she insisted he finalize his divorce from his second wife.  She said that Garcia came to her after working out the $5 million dollar settlement, telling her that his marriage was a sham, a joke that would cost him a fortune. </P>

<P>The witness said although Garcia was upset with the $5 million deal, he mostly cared about marrying her and about moving on with his life. Garcia, she said, had been advised that taking the matter to court would be more costly because of the legal fees,. A few weeks before his death, she recalled him saying the agreement was "unfair" and he began to inquire what his legal options were.</P>

<P>Koons Garcia's testimony is scheduled to continue Thursday. Because of the Christmas holiday, there is no court  scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday.</P>

<P><B>December 24 - 25</B><BR>
No court.</P>

<P><B>December 26</B><BR>
Carolyn Adams Garcia insisted that she did not meet her late ex-husband's lawyer until after her marriage. But a will drafted about a year before she married Jerry Garcia suggested otherwise.</P>

<P>Paul Camara, lawyer for the estate, used his cross-examination of  Adams Garcia to advance the estate's theory that Jerry Garcia was betrayed by his own lawyer, David Hellman, upon entering a $5 million divorce settlement </P>

<P>But even when confronted  with the will, which Hellman drafted in 1980, Adams Garcia maintained that did not recall meeting Hellman until later. </P>

<P>In a heated exchange, Camera argued that Adams Garcia and Hellman colluded to force Jerry into a "sham" marriage, valid only because of "legal mumbo jumbo." </P>

<P>But Adams Garcia testified that she pushed Garcia to marry because it was "an embarrassment" to have children by two different men while married to another. Pressed to reveal who initiated the marriage, she testified that in the cavalier crowd Garcia associated with, it took some prodding to get him to agree to married life. "That's the way it was in the seventies" she said. "That's the way it was in a rock and roll band."</P>

<P>Earlier in the day, Deborah Koons Garcia finished her testimony, defending her decisions as executrix of her late husband's estate. Under the cross examination of attorney David Phillips, she admitted that in 1994 and 1995, her husband paid for all of her expenses, except her two house mortgages. Despite an annual income of more than $300,000, she testified that she received $22,000 a month in support from her spouse. </P>

<P>Phillips also established that in an April 25, 1996 petition to the court for an $18,000 monthly allowance, Deborah stated that the estate was solvent. The next day, she informed the court that the estate may be insolvent in response to Adams Garcia's petition for attorney's fees. </P>

<P>To suggest that Koons Garcia might have tailored her testimony to fit her case, Phillips read from her deposition to show that there was no mention of Garcia calling his marriage to second wife a sham and a joke when he initially told her about the $5 million deal, an apparent contradiction to her trial testimony.</P>

<P><B>December 27</B><BR>
Former Grateful Dead bassist Phil Lesh testified that he rarely saw defendant Carolyn Adams Garcia on the band's tours after her marriage to Jerry Garcia.</P>

<P>The estate called Lesh to prove that Jerry Garcia was involved in a loveless marriage and may have been bullied by his second wife.</P>

<P>But Lesh, a founding member of the Grateful Dead, conceded that more than 30 years were "one big, smoky haze" and he couldn't exactly remember when the defendant was with the band. But he recalled that she was at shows or on the band's chartered plane "very infrequently, if at all" in the 1980s.</P>

<P>Attorneys for Jerry Garcia's estate contend Jerry and Carolyn Adams Garcia married in 1981 only to save on taxes and that she coerced her drug-fogged husband into agreeing to the settlement in 1993.</P>

<P>Lesh's testimony contradicted previous assertions by Carolyn Adams Garcia that she had gone on parts of at least two tours a year in the 1980s." </P>

<P>Lesh said, "Jerry and I never really talked about his private life." But he described Garcia as a "cool dude . . . a very lovable guy and an excellent musician, full of life, full of humor."</P>

<P>Lesh said Garcia had never said anything to him about his impending marriage to Carolyn Garcia.
But he described her as "forthcoming, aggressive." When asked whether she was a bully, he said, "I'm familiar with that component of her personality."</P>

<P>But he added, "None of Jerry's women had exactly been shrinking violets."</P>

<P>Earlier in the day, Carolyn Adams Garcia testified that she attended many Grateful Dead shows in the 1980s. Though she did not give a specific numbers, she said she probably attended more shows in the 1960s and 1970s. Her testimony was interrupted to allow Lesh to take the stand.</P>

<P><B>December 30</B><BR>
Jerry Garcia's bookkeeper testified that she thought her deceased boss married his second wife for tax purposes.</P>

<P>Suzanne Stephens' testimony supported the estate's position that Jerry Garcia's second marriage was simply one of convenience. </P>

<P>But under cross-examination, Carolyn Garcia's lawyer, David Phillips, suggested that Stephens' may have been pressured by the estate, who is her current employer. Stephens said that on May 8, 1996 -- with barely an hour's notice -- she was asked to sign a statement in the presence of estate lawyer Paul Camera and executor Deborah Koons Garcia. In the statement, Stephens declares that Jerry Garcia's personal attorney, David Hellman, told her that Jerry and Carolyn Garcia were getting married for tax reasons.</P>

<P>Other Testimony:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI><B>Jack Phillips</B>, an accountant, testified about the potential value of Garcia's estate. Phillips said that his company, which compiled the data used by the estate's forensic accountant, did not value the catalog of Grateful Dead and Jerry Garcia Songs, nor did it put a value on master recordings of live Grateful Dead performances. Defense lawyer David Phillips is trying to show that the estate deliberately overlooked these assets.

	<LI><B>Max Gutierrez</B>, lawyer for Deborah Koons Garcia, testified that Hellman claimed to have not attended the meeting when Jerry and Carolyn Garcia signed the $5 million divorce settlement. Hellman and Carolyn Adams have subsequently testified that Hellman was present when the deal was signed. The estate wants to show that Hellman was trying to hide his involvement in the deal.
</UL>
<P><B>January 2</B><BR>
A Grateful Dead roadie testified that Jerry Garcia married his second wife, at least in part, to reduce his taxes.</P>

<P>Steve Parish, who began working for the Grateful Dead as a security guard in 1970, testified that Garcia told him, "I love Mountain Girl [Carolyn Garcia] and I've got to straighten out my taxes."</P>

<P>Parish was the only witness, besides Deborah Koons Garcia, to quote Jerry Garcia as saying that the marriage was for tax purposes. But Parish insisted that Garcia never said that he only married Carolyn for the tax break. </P>

<P>Parish also testified that he did not recall seeing Carolyn Garcia at Grateful Dead performances in the 1980s; although he did see her at the hometown performances.</P>

<P>A reluctant witness for the estate, Parish considers himself a friend of both Garcia's widow and Garcia's second wife. At 17, he began traveling with the band. Over the next 25 years he served as security guard, guitar technician, manager of the Jerry Garcia Band, and stage manager for the Grateful Dead. He was Garcia's best man when he married Deborah Koons. Parish testified that he has refused money to talk about Garcia and at one point he was willing to go to jail rather than testify in this "unseemly case."</P>

<P>At points, Paul Camera, lawyer for the estate, seemed exasperated with his witness, as testimony that appeared to hurt his case went on the record. Parish explained that when he told Camera that Carolyn and Jerry Garcia were not together as man and wife from 1979 to 1986, he meant that they did not have a typical "Ozzie and Harriet" marriage. "We were the Dead, we did things differently," he testified. </P>

<P>On cross-examination, Parish testified that life on the road was not family oriented. He reiterated Carolyn Garcia's testimony that a macho atmosphere -- which sometimes involved members of Hell's Angels pervaded the Dead -- making it more difficult for a mother of young children to tour with the band. </P>

<P>Upon the completion of Parish's testimony, Camera announced that he would like to call himself as a witness, possibly to counter some of Parish's statements about their conversations and to testify that David Hellman, Jerry Garcia's personal attorney, said in August 1995 that he was not present when the May 11, 1993 agreement was signed. </P>

<P><B>Other Highlights:</B></P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI><P><B>Stilson Letter:</B> Camera read into the record portions of Deborah Koons Garcia's deposition in which she said Jerry Garcia was upset over the May 11, 1993 agreement. In the deposition, Deborah Koons Garcia also testified that her deceased husband told her the marriage to Carolyn Garcia was a sham and that he signed the agreement so he could divorce and move on with his life. Camera attempted to introduce a letter Jerry Garcia's deceased family law attorney, Bruce Stilson, wrote to a consultant, quoting Garcia as saying that his second marriage was for legal and tax conveniences. Carolyn Garcia's lawyer, David Phillips, objected, calling the letter "double hearsay." The judge sustained his objection. </P>

	<LI><P><B>Estate Value:</B> Forensic accountant, Victor Levi, testified that Carolyn Adams is entitled to $4.5 million, in direct contradiction to the $1.3 million estimate by Richard Schiller, the estate's expert. Levi valued the estate at the time of the May 11, 1993 settlement agreement. Schiller valued it at the time of the January 6, 1990 separation. Levi estimated unreleased audio and video recordings at $4.6 million. Schiller gave these recordings no value, claiming that because the Grateful Dead allowed concert attendees to record the band's performances, the market demand for unreleased live recordings is greatly diminished.</P>

	<LI><P><B>What's Ahead:</B> The cross-examination of Levi will continue. Paul Camera is then expected to call himself and his forensic accountant Richard Schiller. Once testimony is complete, there will be a half hour break before closing arguments.</P>
</UL>

<P><B>January 3</B><BR>
Forensic accountants battled over the value of Jerry Garcia's estate as testimony drew to a close.</P>

<P>Estate accountant Richard Schiller testified that Carolyn Garcia is entitled to approximately $1.3 million Carolyn Garcia's expert, Victor Levi, countered that she is entitled to approximately $4.5 million. </P>

<P>The principal reason  for the different estimates is that Schiller determined the value of the estate as of Jan 6, 1990, the date of separation between Jerry and Carolyn Garcia. Levi used the value of the estate as of May 11, 1993, the date of the $5 million agreement. Garcia earned approximately $7 million dollars between Schiller's date and Levi's date. </P>

<P>Another reason why Levi's estimate was greater: He estimated that unreleased audio and video recordings are worth $4.6 million and that copyrights are worth $1.9 million. Schiller assigned no value to these items. </P>

<P>The judge does not need to determine the exact value of the Garcia estate. He only needs a measure to determine whether the $5 million settlement between the Garcias was equitable and that Jerry Garcia could have afforded to pay it. If Carolyn Garcia loses this trial, there will be another trial to determine the actual value of the estate and what her share should be. </P>

<P>The remainder of the afternoon was spent entering exhibits. Objections once again were raised to Deborah Koons Garcia's testimony that Jerry Garcia allegedly told her that his second marriage was a sham and that he thought the $5 million settlement agreement was a rip-off. Carolyn Garcia's lawyer argued that this testimony is not reliable because Deborah Koons Garcia had to much at stake in this case. The judge deferred a ruling until Monday, but said he is inclined to overrule the motion.</P>

<P><B>What's Next:</B> Closing arguments are scheduled for Monday. When the lawyers are finished, the judge will take the matter under submission. He has 90 days to release a written ruling.</P>

<P><B>January 6</B><BR>
After heated accusations in closing arguments, the judge took the case under submission and said he expects to release a ruling in about 10 days. He has ninety days to release a ruling.</P>

<P>Carolyn Garcia's attorney David Phillips suggested that a special place in accountants' hell be reserved for the estate's accountant for failing to value Jerry Garcia's songs catalog and vault of unreleased music. Estate attorney Paul Camera attacked Carolyn Garcia's credibility and compared Jerry Garcia's personal attorney, David Hellman, to Richard Nixon. </P>

<P>In the morning, Phillips argued that Jerry Garcia signed the May 11, 1993 agreement freely, voluntarily and with full knowledge of the facts. The agreement was intended to resolve any outstanding properties between Carolyn and Jerry Garcia, specifically earnings from his musical endeavors. The validity of the contract in Carolyn Garcia's mind was evident in the fact that she made no further efforts to obtain full disclosure of her husband's estate, nor did she file for further marital rights, Phillips argued. "Actions speak louder than words," Phillips told the court.</P>

<P>Phillips countered accusations by the estate that the Carolyn and Jerry Garcia's marriage was a sham by describing Carolyn as a woman who was very involved in her marriage and committed to her husband. The estate has stressed that through most of their relationship, Carolyn and Jerry didn't live together. Phillips pointed out that Jerry never lived with his third wife, Deborah Koons Garcia, the executor of the estate.</P>

<P>Phillips concluded by saying that if Jerry Garcia were still alive, the settlement agreement would still be honored and there would be no reason for them to be in court. </P>

<P>The attorney for the estate, Paul Camera, argued that the settlement agreement does not qualify as a contract under California law. The 13-line document is not specific enough to be enforceable, he said. The agreement lacks an  explicit waiver of spousal support, an itemization of assets covered by the agreement, and makes no mention of tax payments. </P>

<P>Camera read correspondences between Carolyn Garcia's and Jerry Garcia's attorneys to show that the attorneys considered the May 11, 1993 agreement to be a "proposed" marital settlement. Camera insisted that Jerry Garcia had no idea what community property Carolyn was entitled to when he signed the agreement, did not have full knowledge of what he was doing, and therefore shouldn't be bound to the agreement. </P>

<P>The contract negotiations were further tainted by David Hellman, Jerry Garcia personal attorney of 20 years, who colluded with Carolyn Garcia, Camera said. </P>

<P>Carolyn Garcia pestered Garcia to marry her, Camera argued, and when that wasn't enough, David Hellman urged a wedding for tax purposes. Camera accused Carolyn of deliberately distancing herself from Hellman to conceal their efforts to manipulate Garcia; efforts that began in the early 1980s and continued all the way up until the settlement agreement.</P>

<P>Camera described Carolyn's credibility as "worthless" and said she deliberately mislead the judge about the date of a letter to make him think she and Garcia had a loving relationship.</P>

<P>In rebuttal, Phillips defended David Hellman, saying the estate was accusing Hellman of perjury without evidence.</P>

WILL OF JEROME J. GARCIA 
 
I, JEROME J. GARCIA, also known as JERRY GARCIA, a 
resident of Marin County, California, hereby make, publish and 
declare this to be my Last Will and Testament. 
 
FIRST 
REVOCATION OF PRIOR WILLS 
I revoke all Wills and Codicils heretofore made by me. 
 
SECOND 
DECLARATIONS 
I declare that I am married; my wife's name is DEBORAH 
KOONS. We have no children by our marriage. I have four 
children now living from prior relationships, namely HEATHER 
GARCIA KATZ, born December 8, 1963, ANNABELLE 
WLAKER GARCIA, born February 2, 1970, THERESA 
ADAMS GARCIA, born September 21, 1974, and KEELIN 
GARCIA, born December 20, 1987. I have no deceased children 
leaving issue, and I have not adopted any children. The terms 
``child'' or ``children'' as used in this Will shall refer only to my 
children and if any person shall claim and establish any right to 
participate in my estate other than as provided in this Will, 
whether as heir or in any other capacity whatsoever, I give and 
bequeath to each such person the sum of One Dollar ($1.00). 
 
THIRD 
COMMUNITY PROPERTY 
I declare my intention to dispose of all property, real and personal, 
of which I have the right to dispose by Will, including any and all 
property as to which I may have at the time of my death a power 
of appointment by Will. I confirm to my wife her interest in our 
community property. It is my intention by this Will to dispose of 
all my separate Property and of my one-half (1/2) interest in our 
community property. 
 
FOURTH 
PERSONAL PROPERTY 
Except as specifically provided hereinbelow, I give my jewelry, 
clothing, household furniture and furnishings, personal 
automobiles, books, pictures, objects of art and other tangible 
articles of a personal nature, or my interest in such property, 
which I may have at the time of my death, not otherwise 
specifically disposed of by this Will or in any other manner, 
together with any insurance on such property, to my wife, if she 
survives me for sixty (60) days, and if she does not, then to such 
of my children, by representation, who survive me for sixty (60) 
days in equal shares as they shall agree, or as my Executor shall, 
in my Executor's discretion, determine if my children do not agree 
within one hundred fifty (150) days of my death. 
 
In the absence of a conflict of interest, my Executor shall 
represent any child under age eighteen (18) in matter relating to 
any distribution under this Article FOURTH, including selection 
of the assets that shall constitute that child's share, and my 
Executor may, in my Executor's discretion, sell for the child's 
account any part of that child's share. Any property or its proceeds 
distributable to a child under age eighteen (18) pursuant to this 
Paragraph may be delivered without bond to the guardian of such 
child or to any suitable person with whom he or she resides or 
who has the care or control of him or her. 
 
If neither my wife nor any of my children shall survive me, then 
this gift shall lapse and such property, and any insurance thereon, 
shall become part of the residue of my estate. 
 
FIFTH 
GUITARS 
I give all my guitars made by DOUGLAS ERWIN, to DOUGLAS 
ERWIN, or to his estate if he predeceases me. 
 
SIXTH 
DISTRIBUTION OF RESIDUE OF ESTATE 
After payment of all my debts, my last illness and funeral 
expenses, and provision for my child support obligations for 
KEELIN GARCIS, my marital settlement agreement with 
CAROLYN ADAMS GARCIA which is being drafted at the time 
of signing this will, and my agreement with MANASHA 
MATHESON regarding the house to be owned one-half by her 
and one-half by the trust established for KEELIN GARCIA which 
is being drafted at the time of signing this will, my Executor shall 
divide and distribute the remainder of my estate for my 
wife/husband and children as follows: 
A. If my wife survives me for sixty (60) days, I give her one-third 
(1/3) of my estate outright and free of trust. If my wife fails to 
survice me for sixty days this bequest shall lapse and the amount 
shall be included with the remainder of my estate under paragraph 
B. 
 
B. I give the remaining two-thirds (2/3) of my estate, or if my 
wife fails to survive me, my entire remaining estate, to my 
daughters, my friends, and my brother as follows: 
1. The following shares shall be distributed outright and free of 
trust, by right of representation, to the persons indicated: 
HEATHER GARCIA KATZ ONE-FIFTH (1/5) 
ANNABELLE WALKER GARCIA ONE-FIFTH (1/5) 
SUNSHINE MAY WALKER KESEY ONE-TENTH (1/10) 
CLIFFORD GARCIA ONE-TENTH (1/10) 
 
2. I give to the Trustee hereinafter named, IN TRUST, for the 
benefit of my younger daughters, THERESA ADAMS GARCIA 
and KEELIN GARCIA, one-fifth (1/5) of my estate for each, to be 
held, administered and distributed as a separate trust for each 
child as follows: 
a. So long as my child is living and is under age twenty-one (21), 
the Trustee shall pay to or apply for her benefit, as much of the 
net income and principal of the Trust as the Trustee, in the 
Trustee's absolute discretion, shall deem necessary for her proper 
support, health, maintenance and education, after taking into 
consideration, to the extent the Trustee shall deem advisable, any 
other income or resources of my child, known to the Trustee. Any 
net income not distributed shall be accumulated and added to 
principal. 
 
b. When the child attains the age of twenty-one (21), the trust 
share allocated on account of such child shall thereupon be 
distributed free of trust to that child.

and income provided herein, and that child is survived by issue, 
then the remaining principal and income shall be held in trust for 
those issue under the terms of this subparagraph 2. If my child is 
not survived by issue, then the remaining principal and income 
shall be distributed free of trust to the other residual beneficiaries 
receiving fractional interests in my estate under this paragraph  B 
in proporation to those fractional interests, by right of 
representation; provided, however, if a part of that balance would 
otherwise be distributed to aperson for whose benefit a trust is 
then being administered under this Will, that part shall instead be 
added to that trust and shall thereafter be administered according 
to its terms. 
 
d. Whenever provision is made in this Article SIXTH for payment 
for the ``education'' of a beneficiary, the term ``education'' shall be 
construed to include college and postgraduate study, so long as 
pursued to advantage by the beneficiary at an institution of the 
beneficiary's choice; and in determining payments to be made for 
such college of post-graduate education, the Trustee shall take 
into consideration the beneficary's related living expenses to the 
extent that they are reasonable. 
 
e. Notwithstanding the directions given as to the distribution of 
income and principal in this Article SIXTH, any trusts established 
by this Article shall terminate, if they have not previously 
terminated, twenty-one (21) years after the death of the survivor 
of the class composed of my wife/husband and all my issue living 
at my death, and the then remaining principal and undistributed 
income of such trusts shall be paid to my issue or other 
beneficiaries then living to whom income payments could be 
made under such trusts immediately prior to its termination under 
this clause, such issue to take by right of representation. 
 
SEVENTH 
ULTIMATE DISTRIBUTION 
 
If at the time of my death, or at any later time before full 
distribution of any Trust established under Article SIXTH, all my 
issue are deceased, and no other disposition of the property is 
directed by this Will, the estate or the portion of it then remaining 
shall there upon be distributed to those persons who would then

determined as though my death had then occurred and according 
to the laws of the State of California then in effect relating to the 
succession of separate property not acquired from a predeceased 
spous. 
 
EIGHTH

common-law and statutory powers, and without application or 
permission of any court. 
 
A. To retain any property, real or personal, which the Trustee may 
receive, even though such property (by reason of its character, 
amount, proportion to the total Trust Estate or otherwise) would 
not be considered appropriate for a Trustee apart from this 
provision. 
 
B. To sell, exchange, give options upon, partition, or otherwise 
dispose of any property which the Trustee may hold from time to 
time at public or private sale or otherwise, for cash or other

which acts as Executor and Trustee hereunder, bonds, preferred 
stocks, common stocks, mortgages, mortgage participation, even 
though such investment (by reason of its character, amount, 
proportion to the total Trust Estate or otherwise) would not be 
considered appropriate for a Trustee apart from this provision, and 
even though such investment causes a greater proportion of the 
principal to be invested in investment of one type or of one 
company than would be considered appropriate for a Trustee apart 
from this provision; to lend money to any and all persons, 
including any or all of the beneficiaries hereof, upon such terms

from income distributable to any beneficiary an amount equal to 
the income tax (Federal and State) the Trustee estimates will be 
imposed upon such income; any sums so withheld shall be applied 
to the tax liability of such beneficiary. Nothing herein shall be 
construed as imposing an obligation upon the Trustee to retain 
any sums for the purpose mentioned, nor that said tax shall be

liability shall attach to the Trustee if the Trustee acts or fails to act 
as authorized in Subparagraph M.

language, power to apportion any receipt or expense between 
principal and income and to determine what part, if any, of the 
actual income received upon any wasting investment or upon any 
security purchased or acquired at a premium shall be retained and 
added to principal to prevent diminution of principal upon 
exhaustion or maturity thereof. In this regard, the Trustee in the 
Trustee's absolute discretion, may, but shall not be required to, if 
the Trustees deems it proper, allocate receipts or charges and 
expenses to income or principal according to the Principal and 
Income Law of the State of California as it may from time to time 
exist. All allocation of receipts or charges and expenses shall be 
conclusive on all persons interested in any trusts created hereby. 
 
P. In all matters to administer and invest the Trust Estate as fully 
and freely as an individual owner might do, without any 
restrictions to which fiduciaries are ordinarily subject, except the 
duty to act in good faith and with reasonable care. 
 
Q. The Trustee shall also have the power to do all things 
necessary to continue any business enterprise, in whatever form, 
owned or controlled by me upon my death for such period as the

any other expenses against the Trust Estate. 
 
NINTH 
PAYMENT OF TAXES AND EXPENSES 
 
I direct that all estate, succession or other death taxes, duties, 
charges or assessments that may by reaso of my death be 
attributable to my probate estate or any portion of it, or to any

including but not limited to burial expenses, expenses of last 
illness, attorney's fees, executor's fees, appraiser's fees, 
accountant's fees and other expenses of administering my estate 
shall be paid by the Executor from the estate in the same manner 
as if said taxes were a debt of my estate, without apportionment, 
deduction, or reimbursement thereof and without adjustment 
thereof among my beneficiaries. Provided, however, if there is 
inadequate cash in my estate to pay such taxes and expenses, then 
my executor may borrow such funds as I have given authority in 
Article TWELFTH below. 
 
TENTH 
NO CONTEST CLAUSE 
 
If any beneficiary of my Will or any Codicil hereto or of the 
Trusts created hereunder before or after the admission of this Will

my estate in accordance with my Will or any Codicil, the 
provisions herein made to or for the benefit of such contestant or 
contestants are hereby revoked and for the purpose of my Will and 
any Codicil, said contestant or contestants shall be deemed to

mortgage, alienate, anticipate, or in any other manner affect or 
impair his, her or their beneficial and legal rights, titles, interests, 
claims and estates in and to the income and/or principal of said 
trusts, and the rights, titles, interests and estate of any beneficiary 
thereunder shall not be subject nor liable to any process of law or 
court, and all of the income and/or principal under said trusts shall 
be paid over to the beneficiary in person, or, in the event of the

to the inclusion of particular property in my gross estate for 
federal estate tax purposes, my Executor shall exclude such 
property from my gross estate in the estate tax return. My

beneficary, which loss results from the decision made in good 
faith that there is uncertainty as to the inclusion of particular

all concerned and no adjustment of income and principal account 
shall be made as a result of such decision; 
 
E. Beginning as of the date of my death and until the 
establishment of the trusts provided for herein, my Executor shall

<H2>The Supreme Court</H2>

<H3><A HREF="justices/">The Justices</A></H3>

<HR WIDTH=525 ALIGN=LEFT><BR>
<H3>The Cases</H3>

<P><a href=o'gilvie.html>Court Rules Punitive Damages Taxable by IRS</a><BR>
Punitive damages awarded in a personal injury lawsuit  are taxable, 
according to this  Dec. 10, 1996, U.S. Supreme Court ruling. The case 
involved the family of a woman who died of toxic shock syndrome in 
1983. The family won a punitive damage award of $10 million  in a 
product liability suit against International Playtex  Inc, the manufacturer of 
the tampons the woman used.  At issue was a section of the Internal 
Revenue Code that excludes from its definition of gross income any 
damages received  "on account of personal injuries or sickness." The 
ruling  was a victory for the U.S. Justice Department, which argued that 
the damages should be taxed. </p> 


<p><a href=hopwood.html> Texas v. Hopwood</a><br>
The Court's order refusing to review a <a href=/library/government/texaslaw.html>lower court ruling </a> that struck down the University of Texas Law School's affirmative action program. Issued: July 1, 1996.<p>


<p><a href=savings.html>U.S. v. Winstar Corp.</a><br>
The Court ruling that the government can be held liable for a rule change that plunged savings and loans into financial trouble. The 7-2 ruling said the government broke its contracts with three S&Ls when it changed an accounting rule in 1989. The law that sought to restore the troubled thrift industry to health by tightening rules and providing over $100 billion to close insolvent S&Ls. Until then, the government had encouraged healthy thrifts to take over insolvent ones by letting them count the insolvent S&L's losses as ''goodwill'' assets.  S&Ls also were allowed to double-count as ''capital credit'' government funds provided to help them take over ailing thrifts. But the 1989 law said S&Ls no longer could count such assets toward their minimum capital requirements. The rule change forced many previously healthy S&Ls into the red. A number of them sued, including Winstar Corp. of Minnesota, Statesman Savings Holding Group of Iowa and Glendale Federal Bank of California. Issued July 1, 1996.</p>

<P><A HREF="cable.html">Denver Area Educational Telecommunications Consortium, Inc. v. FCC</A><BR>
The ruling to uphold one section of a 1992 law that permits cable television operators to decide whether to show sexually explicit programs on leased access channels.  But the court struck down a provision requiring cable operators who choose to carry indecent programming to have a separate channel for it and to block out the channel until a subscriber requests it in writing, and a separate provision dealing with public, educational and governmental channels. The justices said the two provisions that were struck down violate constitutional free-speech guarantees under the First Amendment. Issued June 28, 1996.</P>

<P><A HREF="felker.html">Felker v. Turpin</A><BR>
The Court's unanimous ruling upholding an important part of a new anti-terrorism law that restricts appeals by death-row prisoners and other convicts.  Rejecting a challenge to the law in a case involving a death-row inmate from Georgia, Chief Justice William Rehnquist said the law does not improperly limit the Supreme Court's own ability to consider successive appeals by inmates against their convictions or sentences. Issued June 28, 1996.</P>

<P><A HREF="vmi.html">U.S. v. Virginia</A><BR>
The Court's decision ordering the all-male Virginia Military Institute to admit women. By a 7-1 vote, the court said offering female cadets a separate program does not provide an equal education. Issued June 26, 1996.</P>

<p><A HREF=gopspend.html>Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee v. Federal Elections Commission</a><br>
The Court's ruling that spending limits can't be placed on political parties making "independent" expenditures to its candidates. Issued June 26, 1996.</p>

<P><A HREF="gray.html">Gray v. Netherland, Warden of Virginia</A><BR>
The Court's decision refusing to throw out the death sentence for a Virginia killer who claimed prosecutors ambushed him by producing surprise evidence linking him to two other  murders during the penalty phase of the trial. By a 5-4 vote, the Court said Coleman Wayne Gray could not raise the claim in a federal appeal of a state court conviction. Issued June 20, 1996.</P>

<P><A HREF="gasperini.html">Gasperini v. Center for Humanities</A><BR>
The Court's decision upholding the authority of federal judges to reduce large jury awards in certain types of civil trials. The justices held that the Seventh Amendment does not prevent federal judges from reviewing the appropriateness of a jury's award. The case involved an appeals court decision to cut to $100,000 from $450,000 an award to a California photographer whose slides were lost by a New York educational center. Issued June 24, 1996.</P>

<P><A HREF="ursery.html">U.S. v. Ursery and U.S. v. $405,089.23</A><BR>
The Court ruled that the government can prosecute drug dealers on criminal charges while also seizing their property. In the 8-1 ruling, the court found that such treatment of those accused of drug crimes does not constitute double jeopardy. Issued: June 24, 1996.</P>

<P><A HREF="shaw.html">Shaw v. Hunt, Gov. of North Carolina</A><BR>
The Court's decision to strike down congressional districts in North Carolina. The Court held that race should not be the sole factor for creating odd-shaped districts that string together pockets of minority voters. Issued June 13,1996.</P>

<P><A HREF="koon.html">Koon v. U.S.</A><BR>
The Court's June 13, 1996, decision overturning a lower court ruling that ordered increased sentences for the two former Los Angeles police officers convicted in the 1991 beating of black motorist Rodney King.  The justices said an appeals court was wrong to rule that former sergeant Stacey Koon and officer Laurence Powell should get new sentences ranging up to five years and 10 months in prison. The appeals court had held that the trial judge was too lenient in departing from federal sentencing guidelines and giving each of the two officers a 30-month prison sentence.  But the Court said the trial judge was not entirely right either in the sentence he gave the two officers and it sent the case back to the courts in California for further hearings on the proper punishment.</P>

<P><A HREF="whren.html">Whren v. U.S.</A><BR>
The Court's June 10, 1996, ruling giving police broad power to use even minor traffic violations as justification for pulling over motorists and searching their cars for drugs.</P>

<P>Under the unanimous ruling, once a car is stopped because of a traffic violation, police may ask the driver questions and visually search the passenger compartment. If officers suspect a weapon is in the car, they can physically search the entire car.</P>

<P>The Court rejected arguments that police may be tempted to use common technical violations of traffic laws as a pretext to stop cars and search for evidence of more serious crimes.</P>

<P><A HREF="loving.html">Loving v. U.S.</A><BR>
The Court's June 3, 1996, ruling upholding the military death penalty. The Court ruled that the president, as commander-in-chief, has the authority to establish rules for capital punishment for military personnel.</P>

<P><A HREF="smiley.html">Smiley v. Citibank</A><BR>
The Court's unanimous June 3, 1996, ruling that banks can continue to charge late fees to credit card customers who live in states that ban or limit such fees. The court determined that credit cards fees can be considered interest charges and therefore are controlled by laws in the state where the bank is located.</P>

<P><A HREF="ornelas.html">Ornelas v. U.S.</A><BR>
The Court's May 28, 1996, ruling that federal appellate judges should conduct a new review on whether police had sufficient grounds to conduct a search without a warrant. The high court by an 8-1 vote in a drug search case set out the standard to be used in determining if there had been reasonable suspicion by the police to stop and make a search without a warrant. The case involved two men who pleaded guilty to drug possession charges in federal court in Wisconsin. Ismael Ornelas-Ledesma was sentenced to 60 months in prison and Saul Ornelas received a 63-month prison term.</P>

<P><A HREF="bmw.html">BMW of North America v. Gore</A><BR>
In a major victory for American business, the Court curtailed jury awards aimed at punishing or deterring misconduct. By a 5-4 vote, the court struck down as "grossly excessive" a $2 million punitive-damages award won by an Alabama doctor dissatisfied with his BMW sedan. The justices said the huge award unconstitutionally violated the car manufacturer's due-process rights. </P>

<P><A HREF="romer.html">Romer v. Evans</A><BR>
The Court's May 20, 1996, ruling that Colorado's controversial Amendment Two is unconstitutional.</P>

<P><A HREF="liquormart.html">44 Liquormart v. Rhode Island</A><BR>
The Court's May 13, 1996, ruling that Rhode Island's ban on mentioning prices in liquor advertisements violates the First Amendment guarantee of free speech. </P>

<P><A HREF="parenthood.html">South Dakota v. Planned Parenthood</A><BR>
On April 29, 1996, the Supreme Court rejected South Dakota's request to revive a law that would have required unmarried girls under 18 years old to notify a parent before having an abortion. The vote was 6-3 not to hear the case, with Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas dissenting.</P>

<P><A HREF="libretti.html">Libretti v. U.S.</A><BR>
The Court's November 7, 1995 ruling stating that a criminal defendant who agrees in a plea bargain to forfeit property does not have to be told of his right to a jury trial on the amount to be seized. The 8-1 ruling also held that federal rules do not require the judge to inquire into the factual basis for the forfeiture of assets embodied in the plea agreement.</P>

<P><A HREF="kkk.html">Capitol v. Ku Klux Klan</A><BR>
The June 29, 1995 ruling that the Ku Klux Klan must be allowed to erect a large wooden cross in a public square in front of the state capitol in Ohio.</P>

<P><A HREF="lopez.html">U.S. v. Lopez</A><BR>
The Court's April 26, 1995 ruling that Congress overstepped its authority by making it a federal crime to possess a gun within 1,000 feet of a school. </P>

<P>The Gun-Free School Zones Act was passed in 1990. Like many federal laws, it was justified as part of Congress's power to regulate interstate commerce.</P>

<P>Chief Justice William Rehnquist, however, said the law has nothing to do with commerce or any sort of enterprise.</P>

<P><A HREF="babbitt.html">Babbitt v. Sweet Home Chapter</A><BR>
The Court's landmark ruling that rejected arguments that property rights take precedence over aims to protect wildlife habitat on private land. The ruling was issued June 29, 1995.</P>

<P><A HREF="rosenberger.html">Rosenberger v. University of Virginia</A><BR>
The June 29, 1995 ruling that a public university cannot refuse to fund a student-run Christian publication. </P>

<P>The court said the University of Virginia violated the free speech rights of Ronald Rosenberger, a student who wanted money to subsidize "Wide Awake: A Christian Perspective at the University of Virginia."</P>

<P>The defense said that by giving Rosenberger money the University would be advocating a particular religious belief, a violation of the constitutional requirement on Church-state separation. Rosenberger said the University funds 118 groups, including Jewish and Muslim student publications.</P>

<P><A HREF="thornton.html">U.S. Term Limits v. Thornton</A><BR>
The court's May 22, 1995 ruling that bars Congress and individual states from setting term limits on members of Congress.This is the majority opinion.</P>

<P><A HREF="griswold.html">Griswold v. Connecticut Documents</A><BR>
This is a set of documents pertaining to Griswold v. Connecticut, the 1965 Supreme Court decision that struck down Connecticut's ban on birth control and paved the way for Roe v. Wade.</P>

The police bring a defendant, Ernest Arthur, to the police station for questioning in connection with a kidnapping and rape. He is put in a line-up, where the victim identifies him. During subsequent interrogation, the defendant confesses and is formally arrested.

<H2>Paula Jones's Case Against Clinton</H2><P>

<P>Millions of Clinton supporters still disdain Clarence Thomas as a sexual harasser. But a comparison of the Paula Jones and Anita Hill episodes suggests that the evidence against the president is far stronger than the media has let on--and far stronger than the evidence against Thomas.</P>

By Stuart Taylor, Jr.<BR>
<I>The American Lawyer</I><BR>
November 1996<P>

<P>When <I>William Jefferson Clinton v. Paula Corbin Jones</I>  comes before
the U.S. Supreme Court -- as expected -- in January, all eyes will be on
Justice Clarence Thomas. Will a flicker of emotion crease his usually impassive
glare as he ponders a she-said, he- said fact pattern so hauntingly reminiscent
of his own ordeal five years ago? Will he think of how -- in the words that
spill like a raging torrent from Thomas's close friend (and sometime
self-appointed spokesman) Armstrong Williams -- "Mrs. Clinton went out to San
Francisco to present Anita Hill with the woman of the year award"? Williams
adds: "I wonder when she's going to present an award to Paula Jones? And where
is NOW? People need to see the hypocrisy here."</P>

<P>It was actually an American Bar Association commission on women that
presented an award to Hill. But Williams has a point. Hillary Clinton spoke at
the August 1992 award luncheon, celebrating Hill for having "transformed
consciousness and changed history with her courageous testimony" against
Thomas. Both women were hailed as heroines at that ABA convention, by a host of
women lawyers and others who have shunned Jones as a pariah.</P>

<P>Generally overlooked, meanwhile, has been the fact that the evidence
supporting Paula Jones's allegations of predatory, if not depraved, behavior by
Bill Clinton is far stronger than the evidence supporting Anita Hill's
allegations of far less serious conduct by Clarence Thomas.</P>

<P>Jones's evidence includes clear proof, scattered through the public record,
that then-governor Clinton's state trooper-bodyguard interrupted the
then-24-year-old state employee on the job on May 8, 1991, and took her to meet
Clinton -- the boss of Jones's boss -- alone in an upstairs suite at Little
Rock's Excelsior Hotel, for the apparent purpose of sexual dalliance. The
evidence also includes strongly corroborative statements made to me by two of
Jones's friends, complete with tellingly detailed, seamy specifics -- some
never published until now -- that are remarkably consistent with Jones's
allegations about what happened inside that suite. The friends relate how an
extremely upset Jones had told one of them within ten minutes of the event, and
the other within 90 minutes, that Clinton had suddenly exposed himself and
demanded oral sex after Jones had rebuffed his efforts to grope her. One of
these women, Pamela Blackard, also witnessed the trooper's approach to Jones
and her departure to and return from Clinton's hotel room. Both told me that,
on the basis of Jones's detailed descriptions and distraught demeanor that day,
they are convinced that she was, and is, telling the truth. They both signed
sworn, generally worded affidavits for Jones in 1994.</P>

<P>Blackard and the other woman, Debra Ballentine, first told their stories in
February 1994 in exclusive interviews to reporter Michael Isikoff, then of
<I>The Washington Post.</I>  But to Isikoff's chagrin, the <I>Post</I>  printed
only sketchy fragments of their accounts, 11 weeks later. Blackard's and
Ballentine's detailed, previously unpublished stories provide far stronger
corroboration for Jones's allegations than anyone could know from reports by
the <I>Post</I>  or any other major news organization.</P>

<P>There is, of course, other evidence that warrants skepticism about Jones's
account, including the claim by Jones's trooper escort that she happily
volunteered to be Clinton's "girlfriend" just after leaving his hotel room. Yet
while the ultimate truth remains elusive, this article will show that there are
only three logically possible scenarios: that Jones lied in a most convincing
manner, and in stunning, Technicolor detail, to both Blackard and Ballentine,
on May 8, 1991, and to her sisters soon thereafter; that Blackard, Ballentine,
and both sisters later conspired with Jones to concoct a monstrous lie about
the president; or that Jones's allegations are substantially true.</P>

<P>My guess is that she's lying, at least about the more lurid details," I
wrote of Jones in the July/August 1994 issue of <I>The American Lawyer.</I> 
After interviewing Blackard and Ballentine and studying other evidence detailed
below, I'm not so sure of that. And I'm all but convinced that whatever Clinton
did was worse than anything Thomas was even accused of doing.</P>

<P>I say this as one who voted for President Clinton in 1992 and who may do so
again (with multiple misgivings), and as one who lamented Justice Thomas's
confirmation to the Supreme Court, and who disagrees deeply with much of his
archconservative jurisprudence. I don't want to believe that the president is a
reckless sexual harasser, and I'll never know for sure exactly what happened
when Clinton was alone with Jones.</P>

<P>But Jones's evidence is highly persuasive.</P>

<P>So, too, is the absence of evidence where one might expect to find it.
President Clinton has carefully avoided making any statement whatever -- sworn
or unsworn -- about what, if anything, happened between him and Paula Jones. He
has never personally, publicly denied that (for example) he had Jones delivered
to his hotel room by his trooper-bodyguard. Moreover, the president's personal
lawyer, Robert Bennett, has never denied with specificity this or many other
particulars of Jones's factual allegations, either in court or in his countless
media appearances. Bennett has said that the president "did not engage in any
inappropriate or sexual conduct with this woman," and that he "has no
recollection of ever meeting this woman." But he has never denied that a
meeting took place. Rather, he has uttered many ambiguous nondenial denials,
like "nothing happened in that hotel."</P>

<P>Since the Jones lawsuit was filed, the president and his lawyers have also
exploited every delaying tactic at their command, including the pending Supreme
Court appeal, to avoid confronting the evidence. Their sweeping and
unprecedented claim that the Constitution bars all proceedings in all "personal
damages litigation against an incumbent president" was rejected by the federal
district and appellate courts -- the latter in a decision stressing that "the
Constitution . . . did not create a monarchy."</P>

<P>But they have won by losing. While taking their claim of immunity to the
Supreme Court, the president and his lawyers have won interim orders blocking
Jones from taking discovery from anyone: not from Clinton, not from the trooper
who has said he escorted Jones to Clinton's room at Clinton's direction, not
from anyone else. They have also deferred even the filing of an answer by
Clinton admitting or denying each of the specific factual allegations of the
complaint. Even if -- as seems likely -- the Supreme Court rejects the
president's arguments for stopping all proceedings cold until he leaves office,
Clinton and Bennett have already achieved their main goal: The very pendency of
Clinton's appeal has stalled -- until well after the last election he will ever
face -- all inquiry into whether he behaved with extraordinary depravity.</P>

<P>The Clinton-Bennett defense strategy has been a success in the media as well
as the courts. The president's surrogates and supporters have diverted
attention from the most relevant evidence by orchestrating a media blitz
depicting Jones as a promiscuous, flirtatious, gold-digging, fame-seeking slut,
unworthy of belief. They have characterized her allegations as "tabloid trash,"
in Bennett's famous phrase, that are being cynically used by Clinton-haters to
promote a right-wing agenda. While supporters of Clarence Thomas famously used
similar tactics to demonize Hill, they had a far less receptive media
audience.</P>

<P>All mainstream news reports and commentaries about Jones (that I've seen)
have ignored or downplayed the strength of her corroborating witnesses and
other evidence. Many have radiated suspicion of her motives (but not of Anita
Hill's); of her nearly three-year delay in making her allegations public (but
not of Hill's ten-year delay, or of Hill's decision to follow Thomas to a new
job after the alleged harassment had started); and of the uncritical joy with
which her claims were predictably greeted by Clinton-haters and right-wingers
(as Hill's were by Thomas-haters and left-wingers). Many rest on two shaky
premises, the first illogical and the second unproven: that Jones's motives
must be pure for her allegations to be true, and that her motives are in fact
impure.</P>

<P>Meanwhile, not a single one of the feminist groups that clamored first for a
Senate hearing for Anita Hill, and then for Clarence Thomas's head, has lifted
a finger on behalf of Paula Jones. There is some symmetry here: Many
conservatives who reflexively trashed Hill, an apparently demure, dignified law
professor, have given the benefit of the doubt to Jones, who projects neither
demureness nor dignity. What the Hill-Thomas and Jones-Clinton episodes have in
common is that each of them prompted a rush to judgment by people on both sides
of the ideological divide whose conclusions were derived not from evidence, but
from ideological bias. And most striking, in my view, is the hypocrisy (or
ignorance) and class bias of feminists and liberals -- who proclaimed during
the Hill-Thomas uproar that "women don't make these things up," and that "you
just don't get it" if you presumed Thomas innocent until proven guilty -- only
to spurn Jones's allegations of far more serious (indeed, criminal) conduct as
unworthy of belief and legally frivolous.</P>

<P>So maybe it's time -- or past time -- for an in-depth analysis of the
evidence for and against Jones's claims, and how it stacks up against the
evidence for and against Anita Hill's. Of course, we don't have all the
evidence. But we have a lot of it. And because it is the president himself who
has assiduously kept the rest of it from us, it's hardly unfair to him to do a
tentative analysis, based on what we know now, of what (if anything) happened
between him and Jones on May 8, 1991. Such an analysis follows, interwoven with
a chronological account of the tortured process by which Jones's story emerged
in early 1994, amid disbelief and derision, and the subsequent course of the
lawsuit.</P>

<P>The account will begin with events shedding light on her motives and then
focus on more directly relevant evidence. Starting with the magazine article
that spurred Jones in early 1994 to break her silence about Clinton's alleged
harassment of her -- because it implied that she had been one of Clinton's
lovers -- it will relate the bungled efforts by Jones's first lawyer to get
some kind of redress from the president; the fiasco-cum-press conference at
which Jones went public at a Clinton-bashing right- wing conclave; her
retention of two litigators who call themselves "country lawyers," Gilbert
Davis and Joseph Cammarata, of Fairfax, Virginia; the eleventh-hour bid by Bob
Bennett to head off her $700,000 sexual harassment lawsuit through long-
distance telephone negotiations, with the president apparently sitting in; the
allegations of the May 6, 1994 complaint, and the detailed evidence supporting
and countering them; and Bennett's multimedia lawyering since the complaint was
filed, from his repeated appearances on <I>Larry King Live</I>  to his
orchestration of the president's Supreme Court appeal.</P>

<P>Such lawyering does not come cheap. The accrued fees and costs of Bennett --
who has spent more of his own time defending Clinton on television than in
courtrooms -- and his mega-firm, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, have
probably mounted above $2 million already, triple the $700,000 in damages
sought by the Paula Jones complaint. That would bring the total accrued fees
and costs of Clinton's four private law firms to about $5 million [see "Fees:
$5 Million And Counting," page 61]. But to the miraculous good fortune of the
president and his lawyers, two big insurance companies have come to the rescue,
generously assuming responsibility for Skadden's fees.</P>

<P>You should be so lucky, if anyone ever sues you for sexual harassment.</P>

<P><B>A WOMAN NAMED "PAULA"</B><BR>
Paula Corbin Jones's life changed dramatically in early 1994, in a chain of
events that began when she was mentioned as one of Bill Clinton's apparently
compliant conquests, in an article by conservative journalist David Brock. In a
story that detailed allegations by four of Clinton's former state
trooper-bodyguards, Brock reported that as governor of Arkansas, Clinton had
used the troopers both to procure women who caught his eye -- including one
named "Paula," who was delivered to Clinton in a room at the Excelsior Hotel --
and to facilitate and conceal long-term extramarital affairs with Gennifer
Flowers and others.</P>

<P>This was the same David Brock who had written the best-selling 1993 book
<I>The Real Anita Hill.</I>  In a one-sided but semicogent dissection of old
and new evidence about Hill and her charges against Clarence Thomas, Brock had
savaged the demure professor as a liar. Among other things, Brock had stressed
Hill's apparent (but carefully camouflaged) liberal ideological animus against
Thomas and her ten-year delay in going public. For this, Brock himself was
widely savaged by liberals (like <I>New York Times</I>  columnist Frank Rich)
as a right-wing smear artist.</P>

<P>"His Cheatin' Heart," which appeared in the January 1994 issue of the
Clinton-bashing <I>The American Spectator,</I>  began circulating in Washington
about December 17, 1993, and in Little Rock soon afterward. It was followed by
a long, December 21 investigative piece in the <I>Los Angeles Times,</I> 
reporting the same four troopers' allegations about Clinton's sex life, while
stressing a series of efforts made in 1993 by the Clinton camp to dissuade the
troopers from speaking out -- including phone calls from the president himself
to trooper Danny Lee Ferguson. Ferguson -- the one who has said Clinton had him
deliver Paula Jones to his hotel room -- claimed that the president dangled
possible federal jobs for him and another trooper [see "Sidebar: A Trooper's
Tales," below].</P>

<P>According to her complaint, Jones had heard nothing about the Brock article,
or its hint of a quick Clinton tryst with "Paula" at the Excelsior Hotel.
Having sworn her friends and sisters to silence after the Excelsior encounter
in 1991, Jones had been urged to reconsider during the 1992 campaign publicity
about Clinton's extramarital adventures with Gennifer Flowers and others. "I
called [Paula] and told her she ought to do something," recalls Jones's friend
Debra Ballentine. But Jones did nothing, because, she has said, she feared
nobody would believe her, and because she was still working under a Clinton
appointee. Meanwhile, she got on with her life. She and her husband Stephen had
a baby in 1992, and moved to Long Beach, California, in mid-1993. In January
1994 she had returned to Arkansas to visit her friends and family. That's when
Debra Ballentine read the key paragraph to Jones over the phone while
scheduling a lunch:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE="-1"><P>One of the troopers told the story of how
Clinton had eyed a woman at a reception in the Excelsior Hotel in downtown
Little Rock. . . remembered only as Paula, tell her how attractive the governor
thought she was, and take her to a room in the hotel where Clinton would be
waiting. As the troopers explained it, the standard procedure in a case like
this was for one of them to inform the hotel that the governor needed a room
for a short time because he was expecting an important call from the White
House. . . [A]fter her encounter with Clinton, which lasted no more than an
hour as the trooper stood by in the hall, the trooper said Paula told him she
was available to be Clinton's regular girlfriend if he so
desired.</P></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Jones was mortified, according to her complaint. She recognized herself
instantly as the "Paula" whom the trooper had delivered to the hotel room. So
did Debra Ballentine. And so would Pamela Blackard, who had been with Jones at
the Excelsior that day, and Jones's two sisters, and her husband. Jones had
told all of them that she had rebuffed sexual advances by Clinton that day.
What would they believe now? Little Rock is an incubator of gossip, especially
about sex. Pretty soon people all over town would hear about how "Paula" had
apparently been one of Clinton's conquests, and which Paula it had been.</P>

<P>"When people say something like that, it pisses you off," says Jones's
friend Pamela Blackard. "You get mad." Mad at the magazine. Mad at trooper
Ferguson, the Clinton bodyguard who had taken Jones to Clinton's hotel room
that day, and who was obviously Brock's source. And mad at Bill Clinton -- who,
as Jones saw it, was responsible for the whole ugly business.</P>

<P>As it happens, Jones ran into Ferguson on January 8, 1994, a day or two
after learning of the Brock article, at the Golden Corral Steakhouse in North
Little Rock. He was having lunch with his wife while Jones lunched with
Ballentine. According to her complaint, Jones confronted Ferguson about the
article, and he became apologetic, saying that " 'Clinton told me you wouldn't
do anything anyway, Paula,' " and observing that " 'if you decide to go public
with this, the [<I>National</I>] <I>Enquirer</I>  will pay you a million
dollars.' "</P>

<P>"He apologized over and over again," recalls Ballentine, who witnessed the
conversation. "He was acting like he didn't like Clinton at all. . . . He
talked to us for a long time." She adds: "It was just crystal clear to me, if I
had had any doubt [she had told me the truth]."</P>

<P>Ferguson, on the other hand, denied this and claimed in his June 1994 answer
to Jones's lawsuit that Jones had "inquired as to how much money [he] thought
that she could make for herself by coming forward with her allegations."</P>

<P><B>A CHARGE OF EXTORTION</B><BR>
Five days later Ballentine put Jones in touch with her close friend Daniel
Traylor, a small-time solo practitioner in Little Rock who does real estate law
and other work. Jones wanted him to try to get some sort of redress from
Clinton.</P>

<P>What sort of redress? Jones claims that her only purpose was to get the
president to make some kind of public statement clearing her name, and that she
has never been in it for money or fame. But Clinton surrogates have fanned
suspicions about her motives by filling the airwaves with comments like this
one by Clinton counsel Bob Bennett on CNN this January: "Look, this is a
lawsuit where the initial fee agreement with her lawyer, Mr. Traylor, says he
gets a cut of the action of any movies, any book contracts. This is an action
which was announced after an extortion threat was turned down. Do the
Republicans really want to ride this horse?"</P>

<P>Bennett's mention of an extortion threat apparently refers to an effort
Traylor made in January 1994 to send a message to Clinton through George Cook,
a politically active Little Rock businessman whom Traylor believed to be close
to Clinton. Exactly what was said between them is in dispute. Paula Jones was
not present.</P>

<P>Cook, who has said he refused at the time even to convey Traylor's message
to the White House, later signed an affidavit about his meeting with Traylor,
apparently prepared by a Clinton lawyer in Little Rock: "Traylor . . . said
[Jones] had a claim against President Clinton and, if she did not get money for
it, she would embarrass him publicly. . . . He said he knew his case was weak,
but he needed the client and he needed the money. . . . Traylor said it would
help if President Clinton would get Paula a job out in California. I told
Traylor that would be illegal."</P>

<P>Traylor told <I>The Washington Post</I>  in May 1994 that Jones had never
suggested that he seek a job or money from the president. He told me that
Cook's affidavit "doesn't fairly reflect what was proposed or discussed" in
their 90-minute meeting, and denied proposing anything improper. But he turned
aside my detailed questions. What's clear is that Traylor was way, way over his
head trying to deal with the president. His mishandling of the Paula Jones
matter in early 1994 has a lot to do with her difficulty getting people to look
at her allegations and evidence seriously ever since.</P>

<P>Traylor had Jones sign the (now terminated) contingent fee contract on which
Bennett has cast aspersions. It gave Traylor one-third of any amounts paid to
Jones for any news articles or "television, radio, or movie contracts." Jones
has said she assumed this was standard language.</P>

<P>According to her current lawyers, Jones turned down an offer of $700,000 in
mid-May 1994 to tell her story on television. She has pledged to give to
charity any damage award that may be left over after paying her lawyers.</P>

<P>Jones's promise is unenforceable, of course. So, by the way, is the letter
in which President and Mrs. Clinton promised to give to charity (or the
government) any money that may be left over from their Presidential Legal
Expense Trust, after payment of their own attorneys' fees.</P>

<P>An academic point now, perhaps, since the trust's liabilities dwarf its
assets.</P>

<P><B>A RIGHT-WING PLOT?</B><BR>
After getting nowhere with George Cook, Traylor -- a self- described
"yellow-dog Democrat" -- called Cliff Jackson, a Little Rock lawyer and
longtime Clinton critic with contacts in the national press. Jackson had been
retained by two of the troopers to help them peddle their stories about their
roles in Clinton's alleged sexcapades. He met with Jones "and was very much
persuaded that she was telling the truth," Jackson says. He suggested that one
way to get "national exposure" for Jones's story would be to piggyback on a
press conference that his trooper clients were already planning, at the
upcoming Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Washington.</P>

<P>"I discussed the downside to that," recalls Jackson, "which was that it
would be with me, that I was already demonized as the Bill Clinton nemesis,
archenemy -- which is a White House creation, I'm not that. . . . And I knew
[CPAC] was a right-wing organization and that that would be viewed by the
mainstream press and media, and spun by the White House, as something
suspect."</P>

<P>Despite such warnings, Traylor and his client (oblivious to politics, by all
accounts) decided to announce her allegations -- and her demand for a
presidential apology -- at a press conference on February 11, 1994, in
conjunction with the CPAC conference. She and her husband appeared on the same
stage with Jackson and his trooper clients, who were touting a "Troopergate
Whistle-Blowers Fund." Jones told the reporters that Clinton had tried to kiss
her, reached under her clothing, and asked her to perform an unspecified "type
of sex." But Traylor did most of the talking, providing few details and
severely limiting reporters' questioning of Jones. As a result, says Jackson,
"she wasn't allowed to be forthcoming and tell her story." That only enhanced
the suspicions generated by Cliff Jackson's sponsorship and the choice of a
Clinton-bashing, right-wing conference as a forum.</P>

<P>The press conference was a fiasco, and Jones's vague claims were widely
ignored or dismissed as a salacious sideshow. Three days later, six paragraphs
deep in a <I>Washington Post</I>  Style Section color piece, Lloyd Grove made
elegant fun of the whole CPAC affair, ridiculing Jones's press conference as
"yet another ascension of Mount Bimbo" played out in front of a "tittering and
chuckling" crowd.</P>

<P><I>The New York Times</I>  published four short, sober, skeptical paragraphs
the day after the Jones press conference, deep in the paper, ending with a
statement for the president by Mark Gearan, then the White House communications
director: "It is not true. He does not recall meeting her. He was never alone
in a hotel with her." Curiously, Gearan -- a careful man who must have checked
with the president -- omitted the word "room." Jones had not, of course,
claimed that she and Clinton had been the only two people in the entire
Excelsior Hotel that day. A nondenial denial, perhaps? Meanwhile, Clinton aide
George Stephanopoulos dismissed Jones's press conference as "a cheap political
fund-raising trick."</P>

<P>When the press conference flopped, Jackson says, he convinced Traylor to try
persuading a national, establishment newspaper of the strength of Jones's
allegations and evidence, by "giving them an exclusive, working with them
only." Jackson recommended Michael Isikoff, a widely respected investigative
reporter, then with <I>The Washington Post</I>  and now with its affiliate,
<I>Newsweek.</I></P>

<P>Isikoff immediately interviewed Jones (at length, on tape), her husband,
Pamela Blackard, Debra Ballentine, Jones's two sisters, her mother, and others,
including White House officials and Clinton aides in Little Rock, where he did
some of his research. In February, he drafted a story stressing the strength of
their evidence. But the <I>Post</I>'s editors held it up, amid multiple
requests for more reporting, redrafts, and revisions. "The editors involved
felt that more work had to be done right up until the day it was finished and
put in the paper," says Robert Kaiser, the <I>Post</I>'s managing editor. "We
were extremely careful in light of the nature of the accusation." Isikoff, on
the other hand, later told the <I>American Journalism Review</I>: "Having done
the reporting, I felt to not publish the story was withholding information from
the readers."</P>

<P>Frustrated with the Post, Jones and her husband wandered into the welcoming
arms of conservative activists and the Christian right, which was beating a
path to their door. They agreed to be videotaped by producers for far-right
televangelist Jerry Falwell for what turned out to be a scurrilous video called
<I>The Clinton Chronicles;</I>  Jones also appeared on Pat Robertson's <I>700
Club</I>  show on the Christian Broadcasting Network and was interviewed by
conservative media critic Reed Irvine on his cable television show. Meanwhile,
Irvine's Accuracy in Media took out full-page ads in the <I>Post</I>  and other
newspapers accusing them of suppressing an important story.</P>

<P>Were Jones (or Traylor, or other people advising her) seeking something more
than to clear her good name? They did, after all, create a national scandal to
rebut a single paragraph buried deep in a long story in a right-wing journal --
a journal that had not even mentioned "Paula's" last name. Jones and Traylor
have said their purpose was to bring pressure on Clinton to make a public
apology. But the predictable effect has been to generate a huge wave of
publicity far more damaging to Jones's reputation than one small paragraph in
<I>The American Spectator</I>  could possibly have been.</P>

<P>"Maybe," says Jones's friend Pam Blackard, "she bit off more than she could
chew."</P>

<P><B>THE $475-AN-HOUR MAN</B><BR>
What really put Paula Jones's name in the headlines was not her initial press
conference, or even the filing of her lawsuit, but rather the decision by
President Clinton to retain Bob Bennett to defend the case, which hit the
papers on May 3, 1994. Suddenly, it seemed like this must mean real trouble for
the president. He already had David Kendall of Williams & Connolly working
full- tilt to defend him in the Whitewater investigation; now he was hiring an
even more expensive lawyer -- the $475-an-hour man who would be king of the
white-collar defense bar -- to take on Paula Jones and her hapless solo
practitioner from Arkansas.</P>

<P>Bennett, the older brother of conservative luminary William Bennett, had
been recommended to the president and Hillary Clinton months before, by Harold
Ickes, a top White House official whom Bennett had represented in connection
with the Whitewater investigation. According to two sources with indirect
knowledge of the discussions, Bennett had initially met with one or both
Clintons in late March or early April 1994, not about Paula Jones but about
some of their multifarious other legal problems, including the "troopergate"
allegations. As it became apparent that Jones was preparing to sue by May 8,
1994, when the statute of limitations would run out, some Clinton insiders
thought the best way to keep her case out of the news was to assign it to some
obscure lawyer in Arkansas. But then-White House counsel Lloyd Cutler
recommended Bennett, according to Cutler. He reasoned that the lawsuit, once
filed, would be a big story in any event, and that Bennett was especially
skilled at dealing with the media.</P>

<P>Indeed, unlike Kendall -- a tight-lipped, old-school lawyer -- Bennett had
made a name for himself as being especially good at crafting television sound
bites and schmoozing with reporters in his office, and was a capable courtroom
advocate as well. He was on a roll, after a succession of high-profile
engagements, including the Senate's televised "Keating Five" hearings, in which
Bennett had served as special counsel; the defense of aging superlawyer Clark
Clifford; and the securing of a presidential pardon for Caspar Weinberger, the
former Defense secretary, wiping out his indictment for alleged Iran-contra
crimes. As May 1994 began, Bennett was going into sensitive talks with federal
prosecutors on behalf of powerhouse then-representative Dan Rostenkowski
(D-Illinois), in a criminal investigation that was to culminate in an
indictment on May 31, amidst a falling-out between Bennett and Rostenkowski
that ended their relationship two days later.</P>

<P>Bennett, who in the past has spent hours talking with me (as he has with
many other reporters), spurned a written request I sent him for an interview
for this article. Nor did Bennett respond to any of the 31 questions I
addressed to White House counsel Jack Quinn on September 24, with a copy to
Bennett. Nor did Quinn. Neither man gave a reason, but it may relate to
Bennett's complaint that I treated him unfairly in an article in the
July/August 1994 issue of <I>The American Lawyer.</I>  The article, "One Client
Too Many," contended that he had failed to consult adequately with Rostenkowski
before taking on the Paula Jones matter.</P>

<P><B>THE COUNTRY LAWYERS</B><BR>
Meanwhile, Daniel Traylor, Jones's Little Rock lawyer, had come to realize that
he needed some real litigators to mount a real lawsuit. But he had trouble
finding any who would take on the case. Traylor asked around Little Rock;
talked to some big plaintiffs firms; and was put in touch -- by Patrick
Mahoney, an antiabortion activist, oddly enough -- with Patricia Ireland, head
of the pro-choice, ultra liberal National Organization for Women.</P>

<P>All in vain. Finally, in late April, the conservative legal grapevine put
Traylor in touch with two self-described "country lawyers" with substantial
litigation experience, Gilbert Davis and Joseph Cammarata of Fairfax, Virginia.
They agreed to take a look at the case, and soon discovered that they would
have to work fast: The 180-day statute of limitations for a suit under Title
VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act had expired, and the statute of limitations
for most other causes of action was about to expire, on May 8.</P>

<P>Davis and Cammarata worked furiously through the first few days and nights
of May to beat the statute of limitations. They talked to Jones and Traylor by
phone and redrafted and expanded Traylor's skimpy draft complaint while running
across the street periodically to get coffee at a 7-Eleven store. That's where,
in the wee hours of May 4, they also picked up an early edition of <I>The
Washington Post.</I>  <I>The Post,</I>  prompted by the news that the president
had retained Bob Bennett, had finally gone ahead with two long articles by
Michael Isikoff (who shared a byline on one of the stories with two other
<I>Post</I>  reporters). The stories, starting on page 1 and filling up an
entire inside page, constitute the most complete account of the evidence
concerning Jones's allegations that has been published until now. It had
arrived just in time for Davis and Cammarata to add to the complaint allegedly
defamatory statements (about Jones) made by Bennett and White House officials
to the <I>Post.</I>  Later that morning, Jones's attorneys flew to Little Rock
to do what Davis calls "our due diligence."</P>

<P>They met that day with Traylor, Jones, her husband, and their witnesses, and
made sure that Jones had "the fortitude," and her story the plausibility, to
withstand the pressures of a contentious lawsuit against the president, says
Davis, who found Jones to be "a warm and sincere human being." Using Traylor's
office, they continued to rework the complaint, let an expectant throng of
reporters know that it would be filed the next day, and got a little sleep.</P>

<P>Their four-count complaint included federal sexual harassment claims
premised on two Reconstruction-era civil rights statutes (naming trooper
Ferguson as a co-conspirator under one of them), and state law claims for
intentional infliction of emotional distress and defamation. Cammarata says
they had carefully considered adding another defamation claim, against <I>The
American Spectator.</I>  But they decided it would not "pass the legal laugh
test": The magazine had merely quoted what trooper Ferguson, whom it had no
apparent reason to believe was lying, had said about a woman identified only as
"Paula."</P>

<P><B>THE PRESIDENT IS "IN THE ROOM"</B><BR>
Davis and Cammarata recall the next day's eleventh-hour negotiations with
Bennett in a joint interview in the cramped conference room of the modest
Fairfax, Virginia, Law Offices of Gilbert K. Davis and Associates. The big,
beefy, jovial Davis, who says he's tried cases all over Virginia and in some 20
states, chuckles when asked what it's like litigating against superlawyer Bob
Bennett and his mega-firm. Citing a news report that Bennett charges $450 (not
$475) an hour, Davis quips, "We charge less than half that, and I like to think
we're half as good as they are."</P>

<P>Both lawyers say that political animus against Clinton was not their reason
for taking the case. Davis, who is seeking the 1997 Republican nomination for
attorney general of Virginia, describes himself as a "conservative libertarian
populist Republican"; Cammarata says he leans to the Republican side, but once
worked for Jimmy Carter's presidential campaign and is "not just a Republican
partisan here." In addition to being of counsel to Davis, in the spring of 1994
Cammarata had been working as trial counsel with Besozzi, Gavin & Craven, a
Clinton-connected Washington, D.C., law firm, which would soon thereafter
dismiss Cammarata for taking Jones as a client.</P>

<P>On the morning of May 5, Davis recalls he called Bob Bennett in response to
a phone message that Bennett had left for Traylor. Davis informed Bennett that
he and Cammarata were now taking over the case (while keeping Traylor as local
counsel), and were planning to file the complaint by 3 p.m. that day. Recalls
Davis: "[Bennett] said something to the effect that, 'Your client has no case.
I've talked to the president for a long time, and he completely denies that any
of this happened. I've grilled him for hours and hours, and this didn't
happen.'. . ."</P>

<P>Davis continues: "And he said, 'Are you aware there are nude pictures of
her? I've not seen them.' And I said, 'Well, no, if there are, I'd like to see
them.' So they had some knowledge of that already. . . .</P>

<P>"And I said, 'Well, let me tell you this: My client contends [that] she can
identify distinguishing characteristics in his genital area; so when your
client says that he wasn't even there, that's to the contrary.' . . . And when
I told him that, that quieted him down a little bit. . . . And Bob Bennett said
something like, 'Well, it sure is different from a regular old personal injury
case.' "</P>

<P>The conversation, and several others that day, turned from what Cammarata
calls "Bennett's bluster" to an intensive, last-ditch effort to work out a
settlement, the linchpin of which would be some kind of statement by the
president to rehabilitate Jones's reputation. "She wanted an apology," recalls
Cammarata. "She wanted her name cleared. So we weren't looking for any money."
Jones, her husband, and Traylor were with Davis and Cammarata during these
Davis-Bennett phone calls.</P>

<P>After some preliminary negotiations, Bennett said he needed to consult with
his client before proceeding further. For his part, Davis wanted an assurance
that any preliminary agreement worked out by the lawyers would have the
approval of the president. Early in the afternoon, there was another phone
conversation. "I'm on the telephone talking to Bob Bennett," Davis recalls,
"and I said, 'Have you been able to find your client?' and he said, 'Yes, he's
in the room.' And I looked at the others, and put my hand over the phone, and
said, 'He's in the room.' "</P>

<P>"When he said that," adds Cammarata, "it gave me some chills, because here
we are, negotiating directly with the president of the United States."</P>

<P>Minutes later, when Bennett suggested that any agreed-upon statement be read
by a White House press spokesman, Davis and Cammarata conferred and insisted
that it be publicly recited by the president himself. "Bob said, 'I don't know,
hold on,' " Davis recalls, "and then maybe five or ten seconds after that, he
said, 'All right, that's acceptable. ' " Davis and Cammarata took this to mean
that Bennett had just cleared it with the president.</P>

<P>At Bennett's request, Jones held off filing suit that day -- much to the
frustration of the horde of news reporters waiting expectantly at the
courthouse. According to Davis and Cammarata, Bennett's most specific proposal,
which came later that day, included statements to be issued by the president
and Jones, which Bennett and Davis had worked out by phone; at Davis's request,
Bennett had the statements typed up and faxed to Davis in Little Rock that
evening. Davis and Cammarata released the statements, together with a facsimile
transmission sheet on Skadden's letterhead bearing Bennett's name, on October
1, 1994, with a press release detailing the negotiations. Bennett has never
questioned the authenticity of the documents or contradicted the specifics of
the Davis/Cammarata account.</P>

<P>The president was to say: "I have no recollection of meeting Paula Jones on
May 8, 1991, in a room at the Excelsior Hotel. However, I do not challenge her
claim that we met there and I may very well have met her in the past. She did
not engage in any improper or sexual conduct. I regret any untrue assertions
which have been made about her conduct which may have adversely challenged her
character and good name. I have no further comment on my previous statements
about my own conduct. Neither I nor my staff will have any further comment on
this matter."</P>

<P>Bennett had also faxed a proposed statement by Jones: "I am grateful that
the president has acknowledged the possibility that he and I may have met at
the Excelsior Hotel on May 8, 1991, and has acknowledged my good name and
disagrees with assertions to the contrary. However, I stand by my prior
statement of the events."</P>

<P>Davis and Cammarata had asked for a provision tolling the statute of
limitations for six months, so that Jones could still sue if the president or
his staff violated the agreement. Davis says Bennett had firmly rejected any
tolling agreement as "a deal- breaker." And while it appeared to Davis that the
language faxed by Bennett was "acceptable to Mr. Clinton," Davis says it "was
not completely acceptable to Mrs. Jones." Still, he says, "I thought we were
fairly close," and might be able to reach agreement the next day.</P>

<P>Then, that night, CNN broadcast claims by unnamed White House sources that
the reason Jones had not filed that day was that she realized she didn't have a
case and her family opposed the lawsuit. "It was a lie," says Davis; the White
House knew that the reason for the delay was Bennett's request for more time to
work out a settlement. (Davis does not blame this on Bennett, whom he praises
as "a terrific lawyer who keeps his word.")</P>

<P>The CNN report (and others) prompted Davis to break off negotiations the
next morning, in a handwritten, faxed "Dear Bob" letter saying that "the
complaint will be filed today" because "further efforts to resolve these
matters seem fruitless." Davis's letter cited the news reports as evidence
"that the 'no comment' provisions are very difficult to rely upon" without a
tolling agreement. He added: "Other problems exist, including your client's
refusal to make a direct acknowledgment that he was in the hotel suite with
Paula, and that he definitely knows her."</P>

<P>Davis and Cammarata issued their October 1, 1994, press release detailing
these negotiations (but not Bennett's statement about the president being "in
the room") in response to what they viewed as inaccurate comments by Bennett to
reporter Ruth Shalit, writing for <I>The New York Times Magazine,</I>  on why
the negotiations had failed. Bennett had said that Jones's lawyers "would not
agree to any language that included an adamant denial" by the president "that
this incident occurred." In fact, according to Davis, the Bennett-Clinton
settlement proposal included no such "adamant denial." The documents seem to
bear him out.</P>

<P>That same day, October 1, Bennett told CNN: "I want to make it clear that
these were discussions between lawyers. The president didn't agree or not agree
to anything. I wasn't going to present anything to the president of the United
States unless it first passed my test." Closely read, Bennett's statement does
not contradict any of the specifics of the Davis/Cammarata account of the
negotiations. Davis never claimed that the president had "agreed" in any final,
legally binding sense. (Bennett and White House counsel Jack Quinn have not
responded to letters in which I asked them to point out any inaccuracies in the
foregoing Davis- Cammarata account of the May 5, 1994, settlement talks.)</P>

<P>Davis and Cammarata filed the complaint against Clinton and Ferguson on May
6, in the U.S. courthouse in Little Rock, amid a crush of reporters so chaotic
that both men still laugh when they recall the scene. "This case is about the
powerful taking advantage of the weak," Jones said in a prepared statement.
Later that day Bennett entertained another throng of reporters at a press
conference, dismissing the lawsuit with what instantly became his most famous
sound bite: "tabloid trash with a legal caption on it."</P>

<P><B>SHE SAID: THE PROPOSITION</B><BR>
Tabloid trash or no, Paula Jones's complaint contains a detailed narrative
account of her allegations, which are interspersed below with available
evidence supporting and detracting from her claims.</P>

<P>First, a word about who Paula Corbin Jones (then Paula Corbin) was on May 8,
1991. She was 24 years old, and hailed from the hamlet of Lonoke, 30 miles from
Little Rock, where she had barely made it through high school. After coming to
the state capital, she had bounced through several office and sales jobs before
landing a $6.35-per-hour clerical position at the Arkansas Industrial
Development Commission (AIDC), headed by a Clinton appointee. She was engaged
to an airline ticket agent and aspiring actor named Stephen Jones.</P>

<P>She was also a curvaceous, big-haired, outgoing, eye-catching woman who
sometimes dressed provocatively, was regarded by many as a flirt, and had posed
almost nude about four years earlier for a boyfriend who sold the photos to
<I>Penthouse</I>  in 1994, after Jones had become famous.</P>

<P>The May 8 encounter began in the conference room area of Little Rock's
19-story Excelsior Hotel, where the AIDC was hosting the "Governor's Quality
Management Conference." The record is clear that Clinton stopped in and made a
speech. Jones was at the registration desk, handing out name tags and
literature with her co-worker and close friend Pamela Blackard.</P>

<P>Jones claims that she and Blackard both noticed Clinton staring intently at
Jones while he was standing nearby, fielding questions from television
reporters. (Blackard said the same to me in an interview.) A few minutes later,
according to the published report of Jones's 1994 account to Michael Isikoff of
<I>The Washington Post,</I>  trooper Danny Lee Ferguson -- who had previously
introduced himself by name as a member of the governor's security detail --
approached Jones and said, "The governor said you make his knees knock."</P>

<P>According to Jones's complaint, Ferguson returned to the registration table
later, about 2:30 p.m., handed Jones a piece of paper with a four-digit suite
number written on it, and said the governor would like to meet with her there.
"A three-way conversation followed between Ferguson, Blackard, and Jones about
what the governor could want," the complaint says. "Ferguson stated during the
conversation: 'It's okay, we do this all the time for the governor.' " Blackard
told me she generally recalls such a conversation. The <I>Post</I>  quoted her
in 1994 as having told Isikoff: "I did say to her . . . 'Find out what he wants
and come right back. . . . If you're that curious, go ahead.' "</P>

<P>The complaint says that Ferguson escorted Jones to the upstairs floor and
pointed out Clinton's suite to her. (Ferguson's answer to Jones's complaint
confirms this.) Jones says she knocked and entered, and found herself alone
with the governor.</P>

<P>Why did she go? "I was very excited the governor wanted to see me," Jones
said in an interview with Sam Donaldson that was aired on June 16, 1994, on
ABC's <I>Primetime Live.</I>  "[W]hen me and my friend [Blackard] had talked
about it, we thought we might -- could get a job. . . . That's the only reason
why I would think that he would want me up there. . . . I did not know him or
any of his past before that day." Pamela Blackard also appeared briefly on the
program confirming Jones's account of the approach.</P>

<P>Trooper Ferguson's various accounts of these events -- to David Brock, to
William Rempel of the <I>Los Angeles Times,</I>  to fellow troopers, and in his
answer to the complaint -- lend strong support to Jones's allegations as to how
she ended up alone in a room with Clinton, while suggesting that she had
eagerly courted and welcomed any sexual advances by the governor. Here's what
Ferguson told the <I>Los Angeles Times</I>  in 1993, according to articles
published on May 23 and June 11, 1994, in interviews that were initially off
the record:</P>

<P>"Ferguson recalled that Clinton had directed him to approach a woman who was
working behind the registration desk at a seminar of the Arkansas Industrial
Development Corp. at the Excelsior Hotel in Little Rock. Ferguson said the
governor told him that the woman had 'that come-hither look' and that he wanted
to meet her privately.</P>

<P>"Acting on Clinton's orders, Ferguson said, he first secured a room by
telling the hotel manager that the governor was expecting an important call
from the White House and needed a private room. to the room, Ferguson said."
Ferguson also told the <I>Times</I>  that afterwards Clinton had said, " 'We
only talked.' "</P>

<P>It is possible that Ferguson in fact sought out Jones and delivered her to
Clinton on his own initiative, for his own purposes, and was lying to the
reporters. Possible, but not likely.</P>

<P>Ferguson told what superficially seemed a very different story in his
cryptic, carefully lawyered, June 10, 1994, answer to the complaint, which
seeks $700,000 in total damages from him and Clinton. By that time (Ferguson
has told reporters), he had been leaned on by Clinton operatives and had gotten
several phone calls from the president himself, all in 1993.</P>

<P>Ferguson's answer made no mention of what he had said to Jones, or what
Clinton had said to him. Rather, he claimed that before following Ferguson up
to the room, Jones had made "several comments to . . . Ferguson about how she
found Governor Clinton to be 'good-looking' and about how she thought his hair
was sexy," and had asked him to relay these comments to the governor. (Jones
denies this.) But closely read, Ferguson's answer said nothing inconsistent
with his statements to reporters that "Clinton had directed him to approach"
Jones before Jones had said anything to Ferguson. And it confirmed a critical
element of Jones's account by admitting "traveling in an elevator with
plaintiff Paula Jones and pointing out a particular room of the hotel."</P>

<P>All this amounts to clear and convincing proof of Jones's allegation --
which has never been specifically denied by the president personally or by his
lawyer Bennett -- that then- governor Clinton, the boss of Jones's boss, sent a
state trooper to interrupt the 24-year-old state employee's performance of her
job and bring her to his hotel room.</P>

<P>For what purpose? If -- as Jones claims she naively hoped at the time --
what Clinton had had in mind had been getting her a better job or something
like that, the president could have said so by now. The evidence -- and the
absence of any other plausible explanation -- strongly supports Jones's
allegation that the purpose of this exercise was to give Clinton an opportunity
to make some kind of sexual overture. And that seems pretty shabby no matter
what, exactly, happened in that hotel room. Shabbier than anything Clarence
Thomas was ever even accused of doing by the not-exactly-unimpeachable Anita
Hill.</P>

<P>Hill said that Thomas as her boss had persistently pestered her in late 1981
and 1982 to date him and talked dirty to her about pornographic movies
involving big-breasted women and animals, his own sexual prowess, "Long Dong
Silver," "pubic hair on my Coke," and the like. Hill did not accuse Thomas of a
single overt request for sex or a single unwelcome touching. Indeed, she
initially stopped short of alleging that she had been a victim of "sexual
harassment" at all. And while Hill recalled objecting to this conduct, she was
not too horrified to follow Thomas's rising star, after the allegedly offensive
conduct had started (and, she claimed, stopped for awhile), from the Education
Department to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). Nor was Hill
too horrified to keep in touch with Thomas in subsequent years -- getting him
to write a letter of recommendation that helped her land a law teaching job at
Oral Roberts University in 1983, phoning him repeatedly after she went there,
inviting him to make an appearance there, and more.</P>

<P>Indulging for the moment the assumption that Paula Jones is lying about what
happened inside the hotel room, and the further assumption that Anita Hill was
telling the whole truth, which would be worse: What Hill says Thomas did? Or
what then-governor Clinton almost certainly did in having his trooper fetch him
a 24-year-old, star-struck, low-level state worker whom he had never met?</P>

<P><B>INSIDE THE HOTEL ROOM</B><BR>
Here's what Jones alleges in her complaint -- with paragraph numbers and some
paragraph breaks omitted -- and with a caution that this gets pretty
raunchy:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE="-1"><P>Clinton shook Jones's hand, invited her in, and
closed the door. A few minutes of small talk ensued, which included asking
Jones about her job. Clinton told Jones that Dave Harrington is 'my good
friend.' [He] was [the Clinton-appointed] director of the AIDC [and] Jones's
ultimate superior within the AIDC.</P>

<P>Clinton then took Jones's hand and pulled her toward him, so that their
bodies were in close proximity. Jones removed her hand from his and retreated
several feet. However, Clinton approached Jones again. He said: 'I love the way
your hair flows down your back' and 'I love your curves.' While saying these
things, Clinton put his hand on plaintiff's leg and started sliding it toward
the hem of plaintiff's culottes. Clinton also bent down to attempt to kiss
Jones on the neck.</P>

<P>Jones exclaimed, 'What are you doing?' and escaped from Clinton's physical
proximity by walking away from him. Jones tried to distract Clinton by chatting
with him about his wife.</P></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Asked by reporters in 1994 why she had not simply left the room at that
point, Jones said she had always been intimidated by important people and had
not wanted to do anything that might upset the governor. She also noted
(according to <I>The Washington Post</I> ): "I will never forget the look on
his face. His face was just red, beet red." The complaint continues:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE="-1"><P>Jones later took a seat at the end of the sofa
nearest the door. Clinton asked Jones: 'Are you married?' She responded that
she had a regular boyfriend.</P>

<P>Clinton then approached the sofa and as he sat down he lowered his trousers
and underwear exposing his erect penis and asked Jones to 'kiss it.' There were
distinguishing characteristics in Clinton's genital area that were obvious to
Jones.</P>

<P>Jones became horrified, jumped up from the couch, stated that she 'was not
that kind of girl' and said: 'Look, I've got to go.' She attempted to explain
that she would get in trouble for being away from the registration desk.
Clinton, while fondling his penis, said: 'Well, I don't want to make you do
anything you don't want to do.' Clinton then stood up and pulled up his pants
and said: 'If you get in trouble for leaving work, have Dave call me
immediately and I'll take care of it.' As Jones left the room Clinton looked
sternly at Jones and said: 'You are smart. Let's keep this between ourselves.'.
. .</P>

<P>Jones left the hotel suite and came into the presence of trooper Ferguson in
the hallway. . . . Jones said nothing to Ferguson and he said nothing to her
during her departure from the suite. Jones was visibly shaken and upset when
she returned to the registration desk.</P></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Ferguson, in his answer to the complaint, has painted a very different
picture of Jones's demeanor when he saw her "some 20 to 30 minutes" after she
had entered Clinton's room: She "did not appear to be upset in any way," and
"asked if the governor had a girlfriend and Danny Ferguson answered negatively,
and she then responded that she would be the governor's girlfriend." In this
respect, Ferguson's answer was consistent with his 1993 comments to reporters
and other troopers. (It was inconsistent in another respect: Ferguson
reportedly told David Brock in 1993 that he had "stood by in the hall" while
Jones was with Clinton; in his June 1994 answer, he denied this, saying he had
gone back downstairs and had next seen Jones there.)</P>

<P>Ferguson also claimed in his answer that when he encountered Jones a week or
two later, she asked if Clinton had said anything about her, and wrote down her
home phone number for him to give Clinton. "She said to tell him that she was
living with her boyfriend," Ferguson added, "and that if the boyfriend
answered, Governor Clinton should either hang up or say that he had a wrong
number." Jones, on the other hand, says in her complaint that while she was
delivering some documents from the AIDC to the governor's office, Ferguson
spotted her and said, "Bill wants your phone number. Hillary's out of town
often and Bill would like to see you." Jones said she refused. On later
occasions, the complaint says, Ferguson asked, "How's Steve?" and made a
comment about the Jones's new baby, which "frightened [her] and made her feel
that her activities were being monitored."</P>

<P>The complaint says Jones was accosted by Clinton sometime after the May 8,
1991, incident, when he spotted her in the Rotunda of the Arkansas State
Capitol: "Clinton draped his arm over plaintiff, pulled her close and tightly
to his body, and said: 'Don't we make a beautiful couple -- beauty and the
beast?' Clinton directed this remark to his bodyguard, trooper Larry
Patterson." Trooper Patterson confirmed this in an interview with <I>The
Washington Post.</I></P>

<P><B>"I KNOW HE GRABBED HER"</B><BR>
The most impressive evidence supporting Paula Jones's allegations comes from
six witnesses -- including Pamela Blackard and Debra Ballentine, whom I
interviewed separately on October 1, by phone -- who have confirmed that she
told each of them that same day (or soon thereafter, in three cases) that she
had rebuffed sexual advances by Clinton. These witnesses include Jones's two
sisters, her husband, and her mother. All six -- including a sister who has
impugned Jones's motives -- have said they believe her account of Clinton's
conduct.</P>

<P>None of these witnesses has yet testified, due to the president's success in
blocking discovery. All six gave their first media interviews in February 1994
under the exclusive-access agreement Jones's lawyer Traylor had made with
Michael Isikoff of <I>The Washington Post.</I>  Since then, as far as I know,
neither Blackard nor Ballentine had spoken to any other reporter in much detail
until they spoke with me.</P>

<P>Blackard, now a homemaker, is married, with a 5-year-old son. She lives in
Lonoke, Arkansas, where she and Jones had been friends "since we were 2,"
forging what she says is "a special bond." As an eyewitness to some of the
events in the hotel, Blackard provides especially strong corroboration. She not
only confirms every important aspect of Jones's account of the Ferguson
approach, but gives a vivid description -- more detailed than in her affidavit
or any previously published article -- of what Jones said on her return from
Clinton's hotel room.</P>

<P>"I could see her shaking," as she came walking back to the registration
desk, Blackard says. "I could see real far away something was wrong. . . . It
took her a while to tell me about it. She was upset, kind of shaky, and had to
get her breath." After "five or ten minutes," Blackard recalls, Jones related
what had happened. Blackard says she has difficulty remembering the details
offhand now -- more than five years later -- but that "I know he grabbed her.
She said he just kept on moving close to her and putting his hand on her knee,
and every time she stopped him he did something else." I asked Blackard if she
recalled Jones describing something dramatic happening just before Jones had
left Clinton. "He dropped his pants," she responded, "and I don't remember his
exact words, but you knew what he wanted." She seemed hesitant to elaborate.
Had Jones indicated that Clinton had wanted something that Jones could do
without undressing? Blackard said yes.</P>

<P>Blackard added, "It's true. I believe her. If someone goes up, and comes
back in ten minutes, and is shaking -- she didn't have time to make all that
stuff up. And I'm like her best friend [at the time]. Why would she tell me
something like that?. . . And she said, 'I don't want you ever to tell
anybody.' " Why not? I asked. "He's a governor," Blackard responded. "He's
powerful. And we both had state jobs. I was pregnant. I was 24. We were, like,
two young girls. . . . We didn't know what we could do, so we're like -- we're
not telling anybody." Blackard said she had spoken to no reporters in detail
other than Isikoff and me. "I'm so scared of the press, that they would turn
things around . . . and twist my words around," she explained.</P>

<P>Debra Ballentine swore in her February 1994 affidavit that Jones had come to
her office -- a large Little Rock engineering firm where Ballentine was (and
is) the marketing coordinator -- around 4 p.m. that day. After describing the
Ferguson approach and other preliminaries, the affidavit says, "Ms. Jones
stated that . . . she rebuffed three separate unwelcomed sexual advances by the
governor. Ms. Jones described in detail the nature of the sexual advances which
I will not now recount."</P>

<P>Ballentine, now 34 (Jones is 30), gave a fuller recounting to me on October
1. While Jones was one of her closest friends, she said, it had been highly
unusual for Jones to drop in unannounced at work as she had that day, and that
"I could tell just by looking at her that something was wrong." Jones had
started, Ballentine recalls, by saying, "You're not going to believe what just
happened to me," and had then gone through the whole encounter.</P>

<P>Ballentine has confirmed Jones's essential allegations: "She said he was
putting his hands on her legs and he was trying to put his hands up her dress.
. . . She said, 'Debbie, he pulled his pants down to his knees and he asked me
to [perform oral sex] right then.' . . . Before she left, he told her, 'I don't
want to make you do anything you don't want to do.' " Ballentine adds: "He also
told her he knew she was a smart girl and her boss -- what's his name? Dave
Harrington? -- 'is a good friend of mine,' and he told her, 'I know you're a
smart girl and you're going to do the right thing.' "</P>

<P>Ballentine recalls that Jones also told her that day about the mysterious
so-called "distinguishing mark" that Jones's complaint says she saw on Clinton,
and on which Jones's lawyers say they are relying to corroborate her account.
She added: "I said [to Jones], 'You need to go to your boss right away.' She
said, 'I can't -- they're good friends.' I said, 'You need to go to the
police.' She said, 'I can't -- they took me up there.' She just felt there was
nothing she could do. . . . People just don't understand why she waited so
long. She wouldn't ever have done anything if that cop [trooper Ferguson]
hadn't told that story [to <I>The American Spectator</I> ]."</P>

<P>Ballentine also recalls that Jones was extremely worried that day about how
Stephen Jones, then her fiance and now her husband, would react if he ever
found out the lurid details of what had happened.</P>

<P>Is it possible that Jones did something in that hotel room that she feared
would get out to Steve Jones or others, and lied to her friends as a cover
story that day? Or that they all concocted a big lie in January 1994 after
David Brock's article came out? It's possible. But Blackard and Ballentine
don't come across as false accusers. Neither has courted publicity, and both --
Blackard in particular -- at first evinced reluctance to talk to me. Moreover,
Blackard's husband still worked for the AIDC, Jones's former employer, when
Blackard first signed the affidavit in February 1994.</P>

<P>Some other evidence: Both Blackard and Ballentine told me that they had
given similar, perhaps more detailed accounts to Michael Isikoff of the
<I>Post</I>  in 1994 -- at a time when their memories were fresher, when
Jones's detailed complaint (which their recollections track so well) had not
been drafted, and when these witnesses had had less time to be coached by
lawyers than they have now.</P>

<P>Isikoff confirms this. He was quoted in a book by Larry Sabato and S. Robert
Lichter, <I>When Should the Watchdogs Bark?,</I>  as saying of Blackard and
Ballentine: "[They] are enormously impressive and influenced me greatly in
pushing for this. . . . They struck me as highly credible, as people who did
not have axes to grind in this. They were spontaneous, they were highly
detailed, and they were very up-front. And they're not out seeking publicity.
You can accuse Jones of that, but not these two. . . . To the extent the story
could be checked out, it did check out."</P>

<P>This hardly comes across in the May 4, 1994, article that the <I>Post</I> 
finally published. It noted that Blackard and Ballentine had signed affidavits
"supporting Jones's account after conferences in the office of Jones's
attorney, Traylor," and Blackard's account of the Ferguson approach and Jones's
departure to meet with Clinton. But all the Post reported about Blackard's
account of Jones's return was this: "Jones was 'walking fast' and 'shaking.'
She said that Jones had told her that Clinton had made unwanted advances and
Jones implored her to tell no one. 'We were both kind of scared. We weren't
thinking straight. I thought I could lose my job. She thought she could lose
her job.' "</P>

<P>And all that the <I>Post</I>  reported from Ballentine's detailed interviews
with Isikoff was that she had observed Jones "breathing really hard" when she
came to see Ballentine that day, and that "Ballentine said Jones 'couldn't
believe she was so stupid for going upstairs.' " When I read this to
Ballentine, she offered a correction: "That is what I said to her. I said, 'I
couldn't believe you were so stupid. You know how he [Clinton] is.' But she
didn't know, and she probably didn't think it was stupid then."</P>

<P>Paula Jones also gave detailed accounts of Clinton's conduct to her two
older sisters, according to the sisters. Lydia Cathey, who is about two years
older, confirms that she had "ushered her sister into her bedroom, shut the
door, and comforted her sister as she cried on the bed," as reported by the
<I>Post.</I></P>

<P>In an October 9 telephone interview, Cathey added this: "She came over here.
She wanted to talk to me. She was very upset. She was bawling. She was shaking.
And I'm 100 percent for her. It's all true." Had Jones described what Clinton
had done? "Down to the very last detail," says Cathey. "Dropped his drawers and
tell [<I>sic</I>] her to 'kiss it.' " Cathey added: "I tried to comfort her.
She felt ashamed, even though she hadn't done anything wrong. She felt awful. .
. . She was afraid she was going to lose her job, that he was going to get her
fired, because she ran out of [Clinton's hotel room]. He was the governor.
Every day at work, she was on pins and needles."</P>

<P>I could not reach Jones's husband -- to whom Jones did not tell the lurid
details at the time for fear of wrecking their relationship, according to her
complaint. Nor have I been able to reach her mother or her sister Charlotte
Brown.</P>

<P>Here's what the <I>Post</I>  published from their interviews with Isikoff:
Stephen Jones said Paula told him at the time that Clinton had made a pass at
her. Delmar Corbin, Jones's extremely religious, churchgoing mother, said that
Jones told her within a couple of days that Clinton had "wanted to put his
hands on her and kiss her," but she "didn't tell me near as much as she told
her sisters I think because she knows how much it would hurt me." Charlotte
Brown, who is about six years older than Jones, said she had said in a "
'matter-of-fact' way that Clinton had propositioned her" that day.</P>

<P>Brown has drawn more publicity than all of the other five Jones witnesses
combined, because she has aggressively trashed Jones's motives in going public
-- and caused a major rift in the family -- by asserting that Jones did not
seem upset on May 8, 1991, and that Jones had said in early 1994 that
"whichever way it went, it smelled money." Her husband, Mark Brown, has said
that he thinks Jones made the whole thing up; early on, he sought out the
Clinton defense team to volunteer his help.</P>

<P>Nonetheless, in a February 1994 interview with Isikoff, Charlotte Brown
provided rather strong confirmation for the essence of Jones's story. Most of
it was left out of his May 4 article. More was mentioned in his May 6 article
reporting on a May 5 television appearance in which Charlotte Brown trashed her
sister and said Jones had been "thrilled" on May 8, 1991. Isikoff noted that in
his interview with Brown in February 1991 Brown had said that on the day of
Jones's alleged harassment, Jones told her: "'This guard came up to [Jones] and
told her that Bill Clinton wanted to see her. She told me when she met him, he
asked her to have oral sex and she refused.'. . . Asked if she believed her
sister's story, she said she did because she had never known Jones to lie."</P>

<P>Taken together, these six witnesses, all of whom have said Jones told them
contemporaneously about Clinton's unwelcome advances, provide far stronger
corroboration than has ever been mustered on behalf of Anita Hill. While four
witnesses testified that Hill had told them in vague, general terms of being
sexually harassed, only one of them (Hill's friend Susan Hoerchner) said Hill
had identified Thomas as the harasser. The other three said Hill had complained
(much later) of harassment by an unnamed "supervisor." And there is at least
some evidence suggesting that Hill could have been referring to someone other
than Thomas in her complaints to all four witnesses.</P>

<P>Hoerchner -- who had pressed Hill after Thomas's nomination to go public
with her charges -- confidently asserted in her initial media interviews and
Senate staff deposition that Hill's complaints of having been sexually harassed
by her boss had come in phone calls before Hoerchner had moved from Washington
to the West Coast in September 1981. But Hill claimed Thomas's offensive
behavior had started some three months after that. When this contradiction was
pointed out, Hoerchner revised her testimony, saying, "I don't know for sure"
when Hill first spoke of sexual harassment. In addition, when asked by a Senate
Republican whether she had ever filed a sexual harassment charge herself,
Hoerchner said no; when confronted with a record showing that in fact she had
filed such a charge, against a fellow workman's compensation judge, she
responded, "I cannot say that I didn't."</P>

<P>Despite the relative weakness of Hill's corroborating witnesses, every
scintilla of seeming corroboration that has been offered for Hill's story has
been eagerly scooped up by, among others, <I>The Washington Post,</I>  even
while it was deep-sixing the far more compelling accounts of Pamela Blackard
and Debra Ballentine. The leading example was the <I>Post</I>'s October 9,
1994, story rehashing three-year old allegations by former Thomas subordinate
Angela Wright. At over 6,000 words, it was longer than all <I>Post</I> articles
focusing on the evidence in the Paula Jones case combined. "Her Testimony Might
Have Changed History," the headline announced. "Angela Wright remembers
thinking: I believe her because he did it to me," the nut paragraph
declared.</P>

<P>Did what? The punchlines, deep in the article, were a bit suspect: "Clarence
Thomas did consistently pressure me to date him," Wright told the Post, and had
once showed up unannounced at her apartment. Once, the article said, he had
"commented on the dress I was wearing" and asked her breast size. And: "I
remember him specifically saying that one woman had a big ass." But lost in the
depths of this article were the facts that Wright had been fired by Thomas (and
at least two other employers) for poor job performance, including being rude
and disruptive to colleagues; that three witnesses said they had heard her vow
to get Thomas back; and that Wright did not even claim that Thomas's alleged
conduct amounted to sexual harassment.</P>

<P>The Post's takeout on Angela Wright proved to be only the opening salvo in a
huge wave of publicity in the fall of 1994 revisiting the Hill-Thomas episode
-- most of it palpably slanted to overstate the quality of the evidence against
Thomas. The centerpiece was <I>Strange Justice,</I>  a best-seller by Jane
Mayer and Jill Abramson of <I>The Wall Street Journal,</I>  which published a
long excerpt leading with a claim by a woman of extremely doubtful credibility
(who has since suggested that Mayer and Abramson distorted her account) that in
the summer of 1982, Thomas's apartment had in it "a huge, compulsively
organized stack of <I>Playboy</I>  magazines," and walls "adorned with nude
centerfolds." The smoothly tendentious Mayer-Abramson book was greeted with
uncritical hosannas by news organs ranging from <I>The New Yorker</I>  to
<I>Newsweek</I>  to ABC's <I>Nightline,</I>  <I>Turning Point,</I>  and <I>Good
Morning America.</I>  Meanwhile, all of the same news organs were ignoring
Paula Jones and her far stronger, far more current evidence of far more odious
alleged conduct by a far more powerful man -- the incumbent President of the
United States.</P>

<P><B>HE SAID: NONDENIAL DENIALS</B><BR>
What says the accused?</P>

<P>President Clinton's only public comment about Jones's allegations (unless
I've missed one) came at a photo session the day her suit was filed: "Bob
Bennett spoke for me. . . . I'm not going to dignify this by commenting on it."
That's it. Clinton has never personally confirmed or denied any of the
particulars of her allegations. Bennett has persuaded the courts to let him
defer even a formal answer to the complaint. And the media have barely noticed
that Clinton has taken the moral equivalent of the Fifth Amendment.</P>

<P>Meanwhile, the Clinton legal and public relations teams seem long ago to
have abandoned the statement that Clinton "was never alone in a hotel with
her," issued by then-White House communications director Mark Gearan the day
Jones went public. One indication that this line of defense has become
inoperative was the alleged May 5, 1994, Clinton-Bennett proposal to settle the
matter by offering to have the president read in public a statement conceding
the possibility that he had met with Jones "in a room at the Excelsior Hotel,"
and asserting that "she did not engage in any improper or sexual conduct." Now,
the operative defense seems to be Bennett's assertion that Clinton has "no
recollection" of meeting Jones. It reminds me of what President Nixon said (on
tape) to three top aides on March 21, 1973: "Perjury is an awful hard rap to
prove. . . . Be damned sure you say, 'I don't remember, . . . I can't recall.'
"</P>

<P>Compare Clarence Thomas. He angrily denied Anita Hill's allegations under
oath in Senate Judiciary Committee testimony. Of course, he, unlike Clinton,
really didn't have the option of similarly ducking by refusing to "dignify"
Hill's allegations and having aides and lawyers issue nondenial denials -- not
if he wanted to get to the Supreme Court.</P>

<P>Defenders of President Clinton (like those of Clarence Thomas) stress with
some cogency that the conduct of which he stands accused by Paula Jones is so
far out of character that the woman must be lying. "What she [Jones] alleges is
simply inconceivable as Clinton behavior," was the 1994 reaction of Betsey
Wright, who had been Clinton's chief of staff in Arkansas and helped his 1992
campaign combat allegations of extramarital affairs -- "bimbo eruptions," in
Wright's now-famous phrase. The same Betsey Wright has also said, however, that
she was convinced that state troopers in Clinton's security detail were
soliciting women for him and he for them, as four of them have alleged. Wright
said so both in late 1993, to David Gergen, then a top White House official
(according to James Stewart's 1996 book, <I>Blood Sport</I>), and in interviews
with reporter David Maraniss of <I>The Washington Post</I>  (according to his
1995 Clinton biography, <I>First in His Class</I>).</P>

<P>After receiving a phone call from the president in which the Maraniss book
was discussed, Wright, who now is executive vice- president of the Wexler
Group, a Washington lobbying firm, issued a statement through her lawyer
denying Maraniss's account of these interviews. Maraniss responded that he had
double-checked every detail with Wright, and she had confirmed them all, before
publication. (Neither Wright nor Gergen returned my phone calls seeking comment
before press time.)</P>

<P>All in all, there is strong evidence that Clinton had a pattern and practice
of using state troopers to hustle women. That alone is not sexual harassment
(though when the governor does so with reason to know that the woman is a state
employee busy doing her job, it's getting close). But in the end it comes down
to this: Either Clinton harassed Paula Jones on May 8, 1994, in a fashion that
seems out of character, or she lied most compellingly to her friends Blackard
and Ballentine immediately afterwards, or they are all lying now.</P>

<P>Let's not forget that just as nobody but Jones has publicly accused Clinton
of sexual harassment or similarly reckless sexual advances, nobody but Anita
Hill has publicly accused Clarence Thomas of talking as dirty as Hill said he
talked. Indeed, the Clarence Thomas behavior alleged by Anita Hill seemed as
inconceivable to many of his friends and colleagues as does the Bill Clinton
behavior alleged by Paula Jones. A parade of female current and former
colleagues and subordinates of Thomas came forward as character witnesses for
him in 1991. They said that he unfailingly treated women with respect, nurtured
their careers, and was proper to the point of prudishness in his demeanor in
the workplace.</P>

<P>Some acquaintances of questionable credibility (such as Angela Wright) did
suggest that Thomas sometimes spoke crudely, or peremptorily announced things
like "you're going to be dating me." Others have recalled, more credibly, that
Thomas had a taste for pornography, and for talking and laughing about it, at
least while he was at Yale Law School, years before meeting Hill. Many Thomas
foes took this as confirmation that he must have talked about pornography to
Hill. But any interest Thomas may once have had in talking about dirty pictures
with people who did not object is no better proof that he harassed Hill than
Clinton's widely reported interest in extramarital adventures is proof that he
harassed Jones.</P>

<P><B>A QUESTION OF CHARACTER</B><BR>
Probably Jones's biggest problem is that she is generally regarded as a loose
woman unworthy of belief. Indeed, many people -- especially lawyers and others
of the intellectual and monied classes -- need only see a newspaper photograph
of Jones, with her big hair and overdone makeup, to discount her claims. (That
was my first reaction, at least.) "Tabloid trash" -- Bennett's phrase --
resonates.</P>

<P>And then there are the almost-nude photos of Jones frolicking in bed that
were taken by a faithless former lover in about 1987, sold by him to
<I>Penthouse</I> in 1994, and published in its January 1995 issue, after Jones
had unsuccessfully sued to enjoin publication. The existence of such photos of
Jones was, as noted above, one of the first things that Bennett mentioned, in
his first conversation with her lawyer Gilbert Davis, according to Davis.</P>

<P>The class bias that helps explain why Anita Hill received so much warmer a
reception in elite circles than Paula Jones may be a healthy thing, to the
extent that it evidences the (relatively) declining significance of race as a
source of prejudice and stereotyping. But it has not yet been proven that
unsophisticated, big-haired, makeup-caked women from small hamlets in Arkansas
-- even ones who pose topless for sleazeball boyfriends -- are any less likely
to tell the truth than Yale-educated law professors like Anita Hill. To the
contrary, lawyers are trained in devising clever ways of distorting the
truth.</P>

<P>It's true, and relevant, that Jones's brother-in-law Mark Brown has called
her a teaser and manipulator of men who would do anything for money or fame,
and a sexual exhibitionist who had proudly displayed nude photos of herself to
family members. But Brown -- whom Jones and her sister Lydia have both
dismissed as "crazy" -- may not himself be the most credible of characters.
According to the <I>Post,</I>  in his home of Cabot, Arkansas, "he was led out
of a town council meeting [in 1993] for shouting vulgarities at the mayor," who
"says the . . . Marine Corps dropout is known around town for 'blowing off' in
restaurants."</P>

<P>Friends like Debra Ballentine have described Jones as friendly, open,
honest, naive, and totally apolitical. And Jones, unlike Hill, has not been
caught in any significant lies of much relevance to the alleged harassment. (In
fact, her lawyers, like Hill's, claim that she has passed a polygraph test; the
examiner, James Wilt, of Vienna, Virginia, provided me with a copy of a letter
he sent Davis stating that "it is my opinion Mrs. Jones was truthful in her
responses" to questions about whether she had lied in describing her most
graphic allegations against Clinton during a May 24, 1994, polygraph
examination.)</P>

<P>While Hill's specific allegations about Thomas cannot definitively be proved
or disproved, some of her other statements appear to have been deliberately
misleading. In sworn testimony one morning, for example, Hill denied -- five
times -- any recollection of having been told that she might be able to spur
Thomas to withdraw merely by making a confidential statement detailing her
allegations, without ever going public. But that afternoon, after conferring
with her lawyers, Hill corrected herself, volunteering that "there was some
indication [by a key Democratic staffer] that [Thomas] might not wish to
continue the process" if confronted with her statement.</P>

<P>Hill's explanations of some other matters were patently incredible, such as
her suggestions that the main reason she had followed her alleged harasser from
the Education Department to the EEOC was that she feared she might otherwise
find herself jobless. The overall pattern, detailed by Suzanne Garment in "Why
Anita Hill Lost" in the January 1992 <I>Commentary,</I>  was a "disquieting
quality that she displayed . . . as [being] more ambitious and calculating than
she let on. Her testimony on this subject seemed to show a lack of candor, and
this fact alone may have been a basis for mistrusting her." She also had far
stronger ideological disagreements with Thomas than she let on.</P>

<P>In addition, while Hill was praised by many friends and colleagues, others,
like former EEOC colleague Phyllis Berry (who had been fired by Thomas), told
the Senate that Hill was "untrustworthy, selfish, and extremely bitter," after
Thomas had given someone else a promotion Hill had wanted.</P>

<P>Much of the disbelief with which Jones has been received is attributable to
her reputation (as of 1994) for flirtatiousness, provocative dress, and having
slept around, as detailed in publications including <I>People</I>  and
<I>Penthouse.</I>  It's reasonable, and legally relevant, to speculate that
Jones's appearance, demeanor, and willingness to meet with Clinton alone for no
apparent purpose may have emboldened him to think that sexual overtures would
be welcome. But "that doesn't mean that she had bad character or should be
considered a target for some predator," in the words of her lawyer Gilbert
Davis. And it's odd to hear such traits held against Jones by feminists who
would ordinarily go ballistic at any suggestion that a flashy-looking woman was
"asking for it."</P>

<P>When Anita Hill came forward with legally dubious, ten-year-old claims long
after any and all relevant statutes of limitations had run, you didn't hear
many of them dismissing her claims as legally frivolous. Jones, it seems, is
different. "I read the complaint," said Lynne Bernabei, a plaintiffs sexual
harassment lawyer in Washington, on a CNN talk show, "and from a legal
perspective, it seems like the worst she describes is womanizing, unwelcomed
sexual advances, which may be morally or otherwise politically repugnant to
people, but is simply not illegal."</P>

<P>Wow. This is a feminist?</P>

<P>It's true that Paula Jones's legal claims have their weaknesses, especially
her rather vague and implausible allegations that her supervisors at the
Arkansas Industrial Development Commission discriminated against her on the job
in retaliation for having displeased the governor by refusing to submit to his
advances. But her legal theories are hardly frivolous. A single, extremely
outrageous act of sexual harassment, without much more, can arguably support a
"hostile working environment" claim, both under Title VII and under the older
civil rights statutes cited by Jones.</P>

<P><B>"THE TRUTH WILL OUT HERE"</B><BR>
The president's choice of a legal strategy is hardly what one might expect from
a falsely accused person victimized by a complete fabrication. If "nothing
happened in that hotel," as Bennett says, why not simply reveal all relevant
facts, cooperate in discovery, seek summary judgment, and get rid of the case?
Why spend $2 million in lawyering, desperately seeking to prevent the evidence
from coming out? And if nothing really happened, why did then-White House
special counsel Lloyd Cutler go on television on May 24, 1994, and warn: "The
entire presidency could turn on the occurrence of a trial like this"?</P>

<P>Jones's lawyers have visions of putting the president between the rock of
damaging admissions and the hard place of possible perjury; of troopers
testifying about a pattern and practice of Clintonian predation; of grilling
alleged former lovers of the president to ask them if they noticed a
"distinguishing mark"; of compelling a physicial examination of the president
and getting his medical records (much sought after by the Dole campaign) to
find any such mark, or any evidence that one has been removed. But Bennett has
shut them out, so far, by losing on the presidential immunity claim in the
district court and appealing, and then losing in the Eighth Circuit and
appealing again, first for en banc review, then for Supreme Court review.
Meanwhile, there has been no factual answer for Clinton to file. No
depositions. No interrogatories. No discovery into whether there is, in fact, a
distinguishing mark. No trial.</P>

<P>Assuming Clinton's reelection, most handicappers think that the Supreme
Court will reject at least the broadest aspects of Clinton's claim and send the
case back to lower courts for further proceedings. Bennett has a wave of other
motions to dismiss up his sleeve -- for failure to state a claim on which
relief can be granted and for excessive delay before filing suit, at least. But
there could well be discovery, and possibly even a trial, during a Clinton
second term. "The truth will out here," says Jones attorney Gil Davis,
optimistically. "If she's not telling the truth, well, shame on her."</P>

<P>But given that Paula Jones's claims against Bill Clinton are both more
serious by far than Anita Hill's against Clarence Thomas, and supported by much
stronger corroborating evidence, why have the media and a lot of other people
acted as though the opposite were true?</P>

<P>Several reasons. Most obviously, Anita Hill's charges were spread before the
public precisely at the time when Thomas was under the white-hot spotlight of a
Supreme Court confirmation proceeding. She was a superficially impressive
accuser, far more so than Jones. The subsequent televised hearings that
transfixed the nation made it impossible to ignore her charges. And many people
-- not just liberals -- had already been so put off by Thomas's evasive
performance and lack of candor about his views on issues, in his initial
hearing, that they were hardly prepared to give him the benefit of the doubt
when he swore passionately that not one particle of Hill's detailed account was
true.</P>

<P>Jones's allegations, on the other hand, were so seamy, and charged Clinton
with such incredibly depraved conduct, and first came to light in such a
suspect way, that a lot of people didn't want to think about them. One reason
was scandal fatigue: With so many allegations of fraud, perjury, and other
wrongdoing swirling around the Clintons, most people had little interest in
thinking about what many news organizations dismissed as just another "sex
scandal" -- especially one in which there can never be dispositive proof of
exactly what happened. And they didn't have to think about it, partly because
neither Paula Jones nor Bill Clinton was testifying at any televised hearing,
and partly because the media didn't publish the evidence.</P>

<P>The disparate treatment of the two episodes also has something to do with
the difference between justices and presidents. If we don't like a Supreme
Court nominee, can we always hope that if he's defeated, we'll like the next
one better; if Clinton's defeated, we know who we'll get: Bob Dole. Moreover,
we expect our justices to be wise, pure, honest, moral, reflective oracles in
black robes, thinking deep thoughts in their marble temple and saving us from
our baser selves. Presidents are different. If Bill Clinton's political success
has taught us anything, it is that a president can win strong public approval
despite broad and deep public doubts as to his moral character and
truthfulness. There also seems to be a widespread assumption that whatever it
takes to clamber that high on the slippery pole of political success, and then
to do the messier aspects of the job, can only be found in a person driven by
an almost superhuman lust for power and other gargantuan appetites.</P>

<P>But ultimately, an inescapable part of the disparate treatment of Thomas and
Clinton is simple political orientation. One of the most striking things about
the Hill-Thomas battle was how many people seemed confident that they knew that
he (or she) was telling the truth, before the evidence was in, and how almost
everyone who believed her happened to be on the liberal side, and almost
everyone who believed him on the conservative side. Now, with Paula Jones,
there's been something of an ideological inversion.</P>

<P>How to explain the mainstream media's manifest disdain for Paula Jones and
Clarence Thomas, and admiration for Anita Hill? Part of it is class bias
against what one Washington bureau chief called "some sleazy woman with big
hair coming out of the trailer parks." But that's not all of it. Not, that is,
unless you believe that the press would have given similar coverage to a
similar accuser, making similar allegations, supported by similar evidence,
against Newt Gingrich, or Jesse Helms, or George Bush, or Steve Forbes.</P>

<P>That's not what I believe. I think that the political orientations of most
reporters, editors, and producers are at work here. It's no accident that in a
survey by The Freedom Forum and the Roper Center of 139 Washington, D.C.,
bureau chiefs and congressional correspondents, 89 percent of respondents said
they had voted for Bill Clinton in 1992 and 7 percent for then- President Bush.
Mickey Kaus, then of <I>The New Republic,</I>  was more honest than most of his
colleagues when he wrote after Jones's February 1994 press conference: "I
thought it wasn't a big story, but not because I didn't believe it. . . . How
can reporters justify ignoring Jones while paying so much attention to Anita
Hill or the accusers of Senator Packwood? . . . Clinton is . . . the best
president we've had in a long time. That is the unspoken reason that the sex
charges haven't received as much play as you might expect. . . . Few
journalists want to see the president crippled."</P>

<P>Not this president, anyway.</P>

<P>If nothing else, these two episodes illustrate how hard it is for any of us
to see clearly through the fog of preconception in which we all live to a
greater or lesser degree. I would suggest, however, that those who have made
Anita Hill a heroine, Clarence Thomas a goat, and Paula Jones a pariah, need to
try harder to overcome their prejudices. They need to look the facts in the
face.</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">SIDEBAR:</FONT> FEES: $5 MILLION AND COUNTING</B><BR>
If Paula Jones's sexual harassment suit against President Clinton is "tabloid
trash," as Clinton counsel Bob Bennett says, it is proving to be rather
expensive trash to dispose of. But fortunately for the president and his
lawyers, two big insurance companies, State Farm and Pacific Indemnity, have
agreed to pick up the tab.</P>

<P>Bennett, a partner in the Washington office of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher
& Flom whose standard billing rate was $475 an hour in mid-1994 (he refused to
tell me what he's charging the president), has deployed a squadron of lawyers
since May 1994, and, this year, a couple of law professors who are helping with
the president's pending U.S. Supreme Court appeal. Even with no discovery and
no trial (so far), Skadden's accrued fees and costs for the Paula Jones case
may well have mounted above $2 million already, by my estimate. And the fees
could soar much higher if the Supreme Court tears down the presidential
immunity stonewall that Bennett has so far used to shield the president from
any factual development on the merits of Jones's claims.</P>

<P>This estimate is extrapolated from public reports by the Presidential Legal
Expense Trust, which the Clintons created in June 1994, after the filing of the
Paula Jones suit, to take in contributions to help pay their crushing legal
expenses. The most recent reports state that in December 1995, the insurers
paid Skadden $891,880 on total billings of $1,048,707 for services rendered
from May 1994 through September 30, 1995. (The $156,827 that had not been paid,
according to the trust's reports, apparently included some or all of Bennett's
billings for his many hours defending the president on television and in
interviews with reporters.)</P>

<P>That averages to a little over $60,000 a month for services rendered through
September 1995. Since no public disclosures of Skadden's billings have been
made since then, and since Bennett has not responded to letters from me
inquiring into those billings, any estimate of the accrued Skadden fees to date
must be based on outdated numbers. But, assuming that Skadden's fees and
expenses have continued to mount at the same $60,000-per- month rate, this
would bring the total estimate above $1.8 million as of October 31. And that
total would rise to nearly $2.1 million if one assumes (less conservatively)
that the monthly legal costs have averaged $80,000 over the past 13 months, due
to the extraordinary costs of seeking rehearing en banc after the January 9
rejection of the immunity claim by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eight
Circuit; of petitioning for Supreme Court review; and of briefing the case on
the merits.</P>

<P>All of which brings the fees and costs of the Clintons' four private law
firms put together to about $5 million, adding Skadden's fees to the estimated
$3 million accrued by Washington's Williams & Connolly, the Clintons' main law
firm, and $77,000 accrued by two Little Rock firms that have helped out in the
Whitewater, Paula Jones, and other matters.</P>

<P>The Williams & Connolly estimate is computed as follows: The trust's most
recent public report shows the firm's billings came to $2,352,266 (as of June
30) for services rendered through April 30, 1996. The trust's reports show that
the firm's average for services rendered for the six months ending April 30
were about $120,000 per month. If the fees and costs have continued accruing at
the same rate for the six months ending October 31, that would bring the total
above $3 million. Assuming a more conservative $100,000 a month for the past
six months -- in light of the windup of the Senate Whitewater investigation
this spring -- would bring Williams & Connolly down to between $2.9 million and
$3 million.</P>

<P>To date, the languishing trust -- colloquially known as the Clintons' legal
defense fund -- has reported making payments of only $691,134 on the First
Family's huge legal debt, with a cash balance of only $141,932 as of June 30.
The trust has had difficulty raising money -- in part because it chose to limit
donors to a maximum of $1,000 a year, but also because it has yielded to the
opinion of the Office of Government Ethics that it could not actively solicit
contributions and has stopped accepting money from lobbyists after the
president drew criticism for doing so.</P>

<P>Does this mean the Clintons will have to come up with more than $4 million
-- perhaps much more -- to pay their lawyers?</P>

<P>Not quite. To the great good fortune of the president and his lawyers,
Pacific Indemnity and State Farm have bailed them out in the Paula Jones case.
Someone (it's unclear who) discovered in June 1995 some facts that had
apparently escaped the attention of all the president's lawyers during the
first 13 months of the Paula Jones case. This was that each insurer arguably
had a duty to defend the president against Paula Jones's claims under standard
personal liability umbrella policies (covering different time periods), which
the Clintons had bought for a trifle in the early 1990s. Even better, the two
insurers have obligingly paid (or agreed to pay) the bulk of Skadden's
ever-mounting fees after reaching a deal in private negotiations.</P>

<P>Such a deal: You hire one of world's most expensive law firms, and it runs
up legal expenses dwarfing the total damages sought by the plaintiff, and then
you notify your insurance company a year late that you expect them to pay for
it all, and to keep paying as the fees soar through the $2 million mark.</P>

<P>And the insurance payments are benefiting the law firms as well as the
Clintons. Skadden, which would otherwise be holding a very large bag due to the
inability of the Clintons and the trust to pay more than a fraction of the
fees, is now getting paid by the insurers. That takes the Skadden burden (at
least for the time being) off the trust, freeing up its limited funds to pay
more to Williams & Connolly. The Clintons are still indebted to Williams &
Connolly for well over $2 million, extrapolating from the $1,732,266
outstanding balance reported by the trust for services rendered through April
30. As of June 30, the trust had paid Williams & Connolly a total of only
$620,000 -- including $200,000 that the trust took back from Skadden in
February, after Skadden had hit paydirt with the insurers -- on billings of
$2,352,266.</P>

<P>Paula Jones's lawyers, Gilbert Davis and Joseph Cammarata, have run up
"hundreds of thousands of dollars in time" working on the case, according to
Davis. Some of those debts (the rest remain outstanding) have been paid by the
Paula Jones Legal Fund, which was set up to receive donations and has taken in
something under $200,000, according to Cindy Hays, a Washington public
relations agent who runs the fund. This includes half of the $50,000 that Jones
earned in a No Excuses Jeans promotion. (Jones gave the other $25,000 to a
women's shelter in Virginia.) Hays refuses to disclose names of contributors,
saying they were promised confidentiality. A few who have identified themselves
as contributors are associated with conservative causes. But Hays says the
average donation was $19 "last time I checked."</P>

<P>"We get tired of reading in the newspapers that it's being funded by the
Christian right or by the Republican Party or by the right wing of the
Republican Party," adds Hays. "I keep looking for those right-wingers. Where
are they? Where is the money from the Christian right?" -- S.T..</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">SIDEBAR:</FONT> A TROOPER'S TALES</B><BR>
Arkansas state trooper Danny Lee Ferguson -- a crucial witness in any trial of
Paula Jones's lawsuit against President Clinton -- has already told some
tangled tales of Clinton damage control efforts on the female front. Ferguson
was one of four former members of Clinton's security detail who provided
detailed accounts to William Rempel of the Los Angeles Times, starting in
August 1993, of how Clinton had used the troopers to facilitate extramarital
activities and conceal them from his wife and the public. The same troopers
later spoke to David Brock of The American Spectator. This account is based on
reports in the Times.</P>

<P>Before the troopers had agreed to speak for the record in 1993, President
Clinton got wind of what was going on. He asked Raymond ("Buddy") Young -- a
Clinton loyalist and former head of the security detail who had been rewarded
with a federal job in Texas -- about the matter; Young in turn called Ferguson
and trooper Roger Perry, according to Young. Perry told the Times's Rempel that
"he felt threatened when Young warned him that he and the other troopers would
see their reputations 'totally destroyed' if they spoke out."</P>

<P>Young, who denied making any threat, told Rempel that he later met with the
president in Washington to report what he'd learned. Clinton then telephoned
Ferguson, who later told the Times's Rempel that "he received a series of
telephone calls from the president seeking to 'shut down' the story by
persuading the troopers not to talk. During those telephone conversations,
Ferguson said, Clinton offered him a choice of federal jobs," as well as
dangling possible jobs for Perry.</P>

<P>The Times reported all this in a long article by Rempel and Douglas Frantz
on December 21, 1993, quoting Perry and trooper Larry Patterson by name and
Ferguson and a fourth trooper anonymously. The article also quoted a response
by Bruce Lindsey, President Clinton's closest White House aide. Dismissing the
sex allegations as "ridiculous," he stressed that "any suggestion that the
president offered anyone a job in return for silence is a lie." But Lindsey
conceded that Clinton had called Ferguson -- out of concern about "false
stories being spread" -- and did not explicitly deny that job possibilities had
been discussed.</P>

<P>The December 21 article in the Times, and Brock's in The American Spectator,
which had started circulating a few days before, prompted a new flurry of
damage control, especially by Betsey Wright, a close Clinton associate from
Arkansas who was (and is) working as a Washington lobbyist. She flew to
Arkansas and helped publicize trooper Patterson's and Perry's false reports
about a 1990 incident in which Patterson had wrecked a state police car and
seriously injured Perry, after they had been out drinking together.</P>

<P>Wright also visited Ferguson and his wife, who were both still members of
the security detail, serving then-governor Jim Guy Tucker. After intense
discussions, Ferguson issued a carefully worded statement through his lawyer,
on December 22, 1993: "President Clinton never offered or indicated a
willingness to give any trooper a job in exchange for silence or help in
shaping their stories." Later that day, however, Ferguson told Rempel he stood
by his earlier account that Clinton had asked if he wanted specific federal
jobs. The Times reported: "Asked if Clinton expressly said that jobs would be
offered if the troopers remained silent, Ferguson said: 'He didn't say those
words.' "</P>

<P>Ferguson did not return my phone calls. Two people who have discussed the
matter with him say they came away strongly suspecting that he had recorded the
Clinton calls, and is holding the tapes in reserve in case he ever needs them.

<h3>Articles and Analysis</h3>

<ul>

<li><a href=ctruling.html>Connecticut Supreme Court Leaves No Doubt About the Constitutionality of the Death Penalty</a><br>
In a matter-of-fact decision belying the case's significance, the Connecticut  Supreme Court has voted 4-3 to allow once again the execution of death row inmates in state. The decision represents the first time the seven sitting justices have upheld the constitutionality of the state death penalty. It affirms the death sentence of a state inmate for the first time since such sentences were invalidated as the result of the 1972 U.S. Supreme Court case Furman v. Georgia.<p>

<li><a href=/library/miscellaneous/patakiwins.html> Judge Upholds New York Governor in Dispute over Death Penalty Prosecution</a><br>
In this ruling, a New York judge upheld Governor George Pataki's removal of the Bronx district attorney from prosecuting the case of a murdered police officer. The judge's decision to dismiss District Attorney Robert Johnson's lawsuit means state Attorney General Dennis Vacco, whom the governor named to take over for Johnson, can continue prosecuting the case. Vacco plans to seek the death penalty against Angel Diaz, who is accused of killing Officer Kevin Gillespie during a shootout in the Bronx in March. The governor removed Johnson because he felt Johnson was not seriously considering seeking the death penalty in the case. He also contended that such a stance could undermine the whole death penalty statute, since defendants might challenge the law by arguing that it was not being enforced uniformly throughout the state.  Johnson sued, claiming he never ruled out the death penalty in the case and that the governor had overstepped his powers. <p>

<li><a href=damage.html>Michael Ross Tries for Damage Control</a><br>
Convicted serial killer Michael Ross remains determined to stipulate his own execution, and Connecticut officials may be willing to try at least one more time to go along with him. <p>

<li><a href=martini.html>Post-Conviction Relief Review Now Mandatory In New Jersey Capital Cases</a><br>
In a decision that may lead to further delays in carrying out capital sentences, a divided New Jersey Supreme Court ruled that post-conviction relief applications in death penalty cases cannot automatically be waived by competent defendants. The case involved John Martini, a convicted murderer, who did not want to continue to challenge his death sentence.<p>

<li><a href=njtestify.html>Fine-Tuning the Death Penalty in New Jersey</a><br>
Making families of murder victims parties in capital cases for the first time, the New Jersey Supreme Court upheld a controversial statute that allows relatives  to testify during the sentencing phase of trials, but subject to a host of newly devised procedural safeguards.<p>

<li><a href=pete.html>Plans to Boost Death Row Payroll</a><br>
California Gov. Pete Wilson has proposed dramatically increasing the numbers and pay of attorneys who defend death row inmates. <p>

<li><a href=reverse.html>California Death Sentence Reversed Due to Incompetence </a><br>
For the first time in 2 1/2 years, the California Supreme Court has reversed both the conviction and death sentence in a capital murder case. The court ruled that Troy Lee Jones' trial attorney failed to provide effective assistance of counsel. <p>

<li><A HREF="/library/supreme/felker.html">Supreme Court Limits Death Row Appeals</A><BR>
The Court's unanimous ruling upholding an important part of a new anti-terrorism law that restricts appeals by death-row prisoners and other convicts.  Rejecting a challenge to the law in a case involving a death-row inmate from Georgia, Chief Justice William Rehnquist said the law does not improperly limit the Supreme Court's own ability to consider successive appeals by inmates against their convictions or sentences.</P>

<li><a href=/download/library/supreme/vacase.html>Virginia Death Row Inmate Loses Appeal</a><br>
On June 20, 1996, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to throw out 
the death sentence for a Virginia killer who claimed prosecutors 
ambushed him by producing surprise evidence linking him to two 
other  murders during the penalty phase of the trial. By a 5-4 vote, the 
Court said Coleman Wayne Gray could not raise the claim in a 
federal appeal of a state court conviction.<p>

<li><a href=ctcase.html>Warrants For Death</a><br>
A former Connecticut lawyer who faces trial, and possibly death, in a murder-for-hire plot contends that the death penalty is so unusual in New England that it must be re-examined for its constitutionality.<p>

<li><a href=analysis.html>Commentary: Jamal's Last Stand: Infamous Murder Case May Be Significant Test of New Habeas Statute</a><br>
Stuart Taylor Jr. examines how the case of Mumia Abu-Jamal stands as an example of the need for federal courts to remain open to new evidence, even after seemingly intolerable delays in carrying out the sentence of a defendant who was convicted in 1982 of murdering a police officer.<p>

<li><a href=retreat.html>Ross Will Not Retreat</a><br>
Although the Connecticut Supreme Court declined to answer key questions in convicted serial killer Michael Ross' effort to die, Ross is still determined to avoid a full-blown penalty hearing and to accept a sentence of death.<p>

<li><a href=calcases.html>Federal Court Weighs in on California Rules for Death Row Cases</a><br>
Defense lawyers have long griped that the California Supreme Court's old procedural rules for handling death row inmates' habeas corpus claims were hopelessly muddled. Now a federal appeals court has joined the chorus of criticism, ruling that federal courts should not reject prisoners' habeas claims just because the California court found that the claims were filed too late. <p>

<li><a href=/download/library/supreme/loving.html>Supreme Court Upholds Military Death Penalty</a><br>Here is the Supreme Courts June 3, 1996, decision upholding the military death penalty. The Court ruled that the president, as commander-in-chief, has the authority to establish rules for capital punishment for military personnel.<p>

<li><a href=felker.html> High Court Justices Seem Uncertain Where Habeas Jurisdiction Stands</a><br>The Supreme Court hears arguments on a Georgia death penalty case that may affect not only the hundreds of inmates on death rows around the country but the authority of the Court itself.<p>

<li><a href=limits.html>Court Ponders Limits of its Own Power</a><br>
A showdown will likely to occur on June 3rd when the U.S. Supreme Court is scheduled to hear Ellis Wayne Felker v. Tony Turpin, Warden, a case which pits a Georgia capital crime convict against a newly-enacted law that would drastically curtail his ability to appeal his case to the federal courts. <p>

<li><a href=calrule.html>Judges Rules California Doesn't Qualify to Use New Habeas Law</a><br>
A federal judge rules that California cannot use a new federal law to speed up death row prisoners' habeas corpus proceedings, because the state's system for appointing and paying appellate counsel falls short of the law's requirements.
<p>

<li><a href=cablock.html>California Judge Seems Ready to Block Habeas Law</a><br>
A San Francisco federal judge suggests that he plans to hand a total victory to defense lawyers challenging strict new timetables for filing federal habeas corpus petitions in death penalty cases.<p>

Naftali Bendavid of <i> Legal Times </i> examines why reform of the death penalty appeals process, or habeas corpus, will probably exacerbate what many consider a critical shortage of qualified death row lawyers.<p>

<li><a href=special.html>The Michael Ross Case: Why A Killer Offers To Die</a><br>
From any perspective, the story of Michael Ross is an American tragedy. It is the story of the waste of at least nine lives -- the lives of the eight women whom Ross brutally raped and murdered, and his own, now destined to be spent in a cell or to end on a gurney if he is executed by the state of Connecticut. It is the story of a troubled farm family and the destructive mental illness that it may have spawned. And it is the story of an imperfect justice system given the responsibility of deciding the ultimate punishment. Because of the significance of Ross' case -- he is the first man sentenced to death in Connecticut in over a quarter of a century -- and its potential legal precedent, the editors of <i> The Connecticut Law Tribune </i> decided that it was important to understand Ross' decision to accept death for his crimes. This article is the result of six months of interviews with Ross, his lawyers, prosecutors, police and others intimately familiar with his case.<p>

<li> <a href=mulling.html>Mulling the Death Penalty in the Unabomber Case</a><br>
Federal officials have managed to disclose a vast array of information explaining why they believe Theodore Kaczynski is the elusive Unabomber. Charles Finnie of <i> Legal Times </i> reports on the one thing Justice Department officials are keeping well under wraps: the prospect of invoking the federal death penalty in the case.<p>

<li> <a href=habeas.html>Habeas Bill May Boomerang at First</a><br>
Ready or not, federal habeas corpus reform is finally here. Deborah Yaffe of <i>The Recorder </i> reports the initial effect of the bill is likely to be litigation-spurred delays in executions -- even though the bill was pushed by conservatives fed up with the slow grinding of the capital punishment machinery. <p>

<li> <a href=diaz.html>Governor and D.A. Battle Over New York Death Penalty</a><br>The public feud between New York Governor George Pataki and Bronx District Attorney Robert Johnson over the state's death penalty is heading to court.

Mumia Abu -Jamal, a nationally-known journalist serving a death sentence for the murder of a Philadelphia police officer, says National Public Radio violated his First Amendment rights. In a civil lawsuit filed in federal court,the former radio journalist contends that NPR decided not to run a recorded broadcast of his death-row commentary for the show ''All Things Considered'' because of political pressure from the Fraternal Order of Police and  U.S. Sen. Robert Dole.<p>

<li><a href=garule.html>Ruling on Death-Penalty Jurors Prompts Sharp Dissents</a><br>
Over a pair of sharp dissents, the Georgia Supreme Court upholds a death penalty imposed by a jury from which the trial judge excluded five people who had doubts about capital punishment.<p>

<li><a href=default.html>Should Death Sentence Be a Judgment by Default?</a><br>
The New Jersey Supreme Court has dealt with almost every issue that could arise in a death penalty case, but always in the context of appeals of death row prisoners who wanted to stop their executions. Now the court has to decide whether the state -- as executioner -- has a duty to ensure that a murderer who wants to be executed was properly convicted.<p>

It's lies, lies, lies, lies."</P>

<p><a href="/library/misc/killers.html"> "Natural Born Killers" on Trial</a><br>

A Louisiana woman left paralyzed by a robber who shot her after watching "Natural Born Killers" claims Hollywood is partly to blame. Patsy Byers was working at the Time Saver store when 18-year-old Sarah Edmondson came in, shot her and stole money from the cash register. Edmondson later told police that she and her boyfriend Benjamin Darrus took drugs and went on a shooting spree after repeatedly watching the Oliver Stone movie. In her lawsuit, Byers' claims Stone, Warner Bros. and several other defendants knew or should have known that the movie "would cause and inspire people such as the defendants to commit crimes." The case has pitted best-selling novelist John Grisham against Stone. Grisham has urged lawsuits against the movie, claiming it glamorizes casual mayhem and bloodlust. Grisham was friends with Bill Savage, a businessman fatally shot by Edmondson and Darrus.</P>

Doctors took more x-rays and said he had a virus. He later died of a ruptured aortic aneurysm. His estate claims the aneurysm should have been detected in the x-rays.</P>

Lawyer F. Lee Bailey turned himself in to U.S. marshals in Tallahassee March 6 to begin serving a six-month jail term after a judge held him in contempt of court. Bailey failed to obey an order to turn over $2.3 million obtained from convicted drug smuggler Claude Duboc.</P>

<H2>Lighting Up, But Not Laid Back</H2><P>

By Mike McKee<BR>
<I>The Recorder</I><BR>
January 3, 1997<P>

Alone on a sofa in a corner of the cavernous smoking room of a Mission District marijuana buyers' club, "Animal" Joe Smith takes a hit off the joint he just rolled by hand.<P>

The cheery 34-year-old, who says pot gave him the appetite to regain 18 pounds lost to HIV last summer, sounds like the public relations officer for the club called Flower Therapy: He lauds the stress-free environment, the interaction with other medicinal smokers and the ability "to regularly obtain good, quality marijuana in an atmosphere that's relatively safe."<P>

Yet like others at the 17th Street club, Smith knows that state and federal law enforcement officials are waiting and watching, ready to pounce on buyers' clubs and their patrons at any moment.<P>

"Even with the passage of Prop 215, I don't trust that [California Attorney General] Dan Lungren has my best interests at heart," Smith says as he takes another drag. "I'm still looking over my shoulder when I come in the door."<P>

Smith, a musician and one-time performance artist who contracted HIV four years ago, could very well be speaking for the wary operators of a half-dozen clubs that have quietly sprouted up in San Francisco over the last five months, supplying marijuana to people who claim it alleviates the symptoms of their illnesses. The clubs, which might have been expected to experience newfound freedom when voters approved Proposition 215 in November, have instead functioned like fortresses under fire.<P>

Rather than loosening up, most clubs -- hearing the war drums from Sacramento and Washington, D.C., grow louder -- have tightened up, establishing stringent membership criteria that exceed what's required by the medical marijuana initiative.<P>

Most controversial are buyers' club documents requiring doctors to go public with their names and license numbers if they favor marijuana for patients, even though Prop 215 legalized verbal recommendations. This at a time when the Clinton administration has targeted doctors -- the clubs' most critical allies -- as the weak link in the medical marijuana chain because many fear getting their licenses yanked for recommending pot.<P>

"It's had a chilling effect on the physicians who are willing to step forward," says Berkeley psychiatrist Tod Mikuriya, a longtime advocate of medicinal marijuana who regularly posts his opinions on the Internet. "[Club operators are] playing doctor and defeating the whole reason the initiative was put on the ballot."<P>

The new rules at pot clubs also have created a schism with some of the movement's most outspoken leaders, who call the paperwork barriers overkill.<P>

"The powers that be [in Sacramento and Washington] are attempting to create a climate where people will accept limits that Prop 215 didn't want in place," says John Entwistle Jr., legislative advocate for Californians for Compassionate Use, a grass-roots organization in San Francisco that's largely responsible for Prop 215. "And some clubs are accepting [those limits] because of fear."<P>

Club operators, though, insist that -- with federal and state authorities breathing down their necks -- they would be foolhardy to take unnecessary risks.<P>

"We need paper. We need proof," says John Hudson, founder of Flower Therapy. "It's accountability. I know that much from my lawyer."<P>

WISE MOVE OR PARANOIA?<BR>
Hudson and others have ample reason to worry. State law enforcement officials have vowed to crack down on buyers' clubs, arguing Prop 215 didn't legalize pot sales but rather only lets patients use doctor-recommended marijuana grown by themselves or their ill-defined caregivers.<P>

Federal authorities contributed to mounting fears recently by announcing plans to prosecute buyers' clubs as large-scale distributors and also threatening to arrest cooperating doctors or strip them of their federally granted prescription powers.<P>

"The proposition made no provisions whatsoever about sale," says Stan Vegar, a spokesman for the San Francisco office of the federal Drug Enforcement Administration. "Sale at any level is illegal."<P>

Hoping to head off disaster, most buyers' clubs now demand that potential clients produce valid identification, an official medical diagnosis and a recent letter -- signed by doctors on letterhead stationery and bearing their license number -- recommending marijuana. They also require pot-seekers to sign medical release forms and promise in writing not to resell or distribute the clubs' wares.<P>

Nearly all the clubs say they also call prospective members' doctors to confirm diagnoses, then verify the physician's credentials with the Medical Board of California to ferret out phonies fabricated by narcotics officers looking for a bust. State agents raided San Francisco's original Cannabis Buyers' Club on Market Street in August, driven partly by sales to undercover cops claiming recommendations by nonexistent doctors.<P>

Club operators don't intend to get fooled again.<P>

"The paperwork is to cover our ass so we're not accused of selling to people who don't need [marijuana] medically," says epidemiologist Vic Hern ndez, founder of a club called CHAMP -- Cannabis Helping Alleviate Medical Problems -- near Church and Market streets. "People want assurance that this is going to be a safe place."<P>

Hernandez is following the advice of Pillsbury Madison & Sutro partner Thomas Loran III, who strongly advocates comprehensive record-keeping.<P>

"We feel that we have to document, to some extent, who we are giving [marijuana] to, the medical basis for it and the fact that this is being recommended by a health care provider who is a physician," says Loran, who represents CHAMP pro bono. "[But] we are aware that physicians will increasingly become reluctant to be identified."<P>

The conservative approach of most clubs upsets the top dogs of the medical marijuana movement, who don't want Prop 215 undermined by their own allies.<P>

"It's intimidating doctors and I think that's wrong, and it's intimidating patients and I think that's wrong," says Dennis Peron, director of Californians for Compassionate Use and founder of the original Cannabis Buyers' Club, which is still fighting Lungren in court. "It's a wave of paranoia and paranoia is by definition irrational fear."<P>

Peron notes that while his cannabis club always demanded a medical diagnosis from pot-seekers, it never required "interrogating your doctor." And he doesn't intend to start doing that on Jan. 15, when he reincarnates his current business near the Civic Center as the Cannabis Cultivators' Club.<P>

"We're on the honor system here," he says. "You tell us your doctor recommends marijuana and that's fine with us. I'm not going to put up any impediment."<P>

Hudson, Hernandez and most other club founders favor what could be called aggressive caution -- making sure marijuana is available to the needy, but conceding that legal dangers exist. Yet Peron and Entwistle, inspired by the fact that Prop 215 was approved by a whopping 56 percent, don't see any reason to make patients or doctors jump through extra hoops, and they dare the government to make trouble now that the initiative is on the books as Health & Safety Code 11362.5.<P>

"Dan Lungren's taking advantage of ignorance of the law," Entwistle says, "and his ability to create a climate of fear."<P>

NOT-SO-BRAVE NEW WORLD<BR>
Many allies of Entwistle and Peron admire their daring, but are concerned that the duo is blithely stepping into legal hot water by vowing to accept verbal recommendations.<P>

"That's kind of crazy," says Jeff Jones, director of the Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Club. "I've always been behind Dennis in what he has done, being in the forefront, but I don't support that [particular] judgment. With Dennis not taking paperwork, how's he going to keep track?"<P>

Jones also feels that Peron's approach lets doctors hide behind their patients.<P>

"I want the doctor to get involved with the person [he's] treating," Jones says, "to be, in a word, part of the 'conspiracy.'"<P>

That's a sacrifice most doctors aren't willing to make yet. The majority, in fact, still refuse to acknowledge the new law, period.<P>

"A patient has to understand that while I'll do [almost] anything I can to help him, there comes a point where I won't jeopardize my license by giving him something that's illegal federally," says Dr. Melvin Kirschner, a Van Nuys family practitioner who's also chairman of the Los Angeles medical and bar associations' Joint Committee on Biomedical Ethics. "Either you do it for good legal reasons or you don't do it."<P>

Even doctors like Berkeley's Mikuriya, who admits recommending marijuana to 178 people, has begun taking steps toward self-preservation.<P>

"I'm tightening up my interview procedure and videotaping every applicant -- and taking a still photo ID picture," he says. "They are going to have to have verifiable medical documentation from some other facility. It's beyond paranoia."<P>

Doctors might get a break in San Francisco, though, where District Attorney Terence Hallinan says he'd be willing to set up a procedure allowing doctors to remain anonymous.<P>

"Everybody would prefer [that doctors put their recommendations in writing], but I understand the legal situation," Hallinan says, "and it would be acceptable to me if [a patient] signed an affidavit under penalty of perjury that you have a recommendation by a doctor."<P>

This touchy issue is already playing out in a Sonoma County case, in which a man who says he needs pot to control his epilepsy is being prosecuted on possession and cultivation charges.<P>

In what is believed to be the first such ruling since Prop 215 was passed, a judge on Dec. 17 rejected defendant Alan Martinez's request that his doctor be allowed to testify anonymously that he had recommended marijuana. Oakland solo practitioner William Panzer had argued that the unidentified doctor could testify about his recommendation either _in camera_ in the judge's chambers or by redacting his name from documents filed under seal.<P>

But Municipal Court Judge Mark Tansil said no, explaining that he was "confident" doctors would "testify on direct and cross-examination in the open light of this court."<P>

Panzer says he plans to ask the superior court to review Tansil's decision.<P>

SAFE HOUSES<BR>
Despite the differences among the movement's leaders -- and in spite of threats by state AG Lungren and Clinton administration drug czar Barry McCaffrey to shut clubs down -- smokers are continuing to find a measure of peace in buyers' clubs that they would never have elsewhere.<P>

The clubs are, in effect, safe houses.<P>

"The value of a place like this is not limited to the merchandise," "Animal" Joe Smith says in the confines of Flower Therapy. "We talk to each other. We boost each other. We trade treatment ideas."<P>

A few people at Flower Therapy one day last month said they had faced doctors who wouldn't recommend marijuana for fear of federal retribution or who OK'd it only after seeing improvements in patients who acquired pot on the streets. A 35 -year-old man, diagnosed with stomach cancer and epilepsy, says his physician said no three times before witnessing his patient's weight blossom from 111 pounds to 161.<P>

"He didn't think it would help, but then he saw how much bigger I got, and he wrote out the letter of diagnosis," says the man, who requests anonymity. "He put his doctor's license [number] and his name on the document."<P>

Several doctors must be braving crackdowns, because Hern ndez estimates that about 50 people a day pass through his club, above a gay bar called the Transfer. Hudson says Flower Therapy, in a converted appliance repair shop just off South Van Ness Avenue, attracts as many as 150 a day.<P>

At Flower Therapy, registration forms and medical marijuana literature are displayed up front, and a glass counter further back showcases packets of marijuana -- obtained from "growers up north" -- and assorted pot-laced baked goods, such as brownies and banana bread, going two for five dollars. A chalkboard lists leaf prices, ranging this particular day from eight dollars for an eighth of an ounce of Mexican brown to $60 for an eighth of the second-best variety of California green. The top grade is sold out.<P>

Smokers who make a purchase -- and almost all do once clearing the admissions process -- can then retire to a huge, but comfortable, back room to clean, roll and inhale. There's an easy comradeship evident, with informal gatherings of two or more people around a room that's reminiscent of a John Waters movie set. Warm greetings are exchanged among regulars and just about everyone is eager to cuss out the government or discuss the wonders of marijuana.<P>

There's 51-year-old Jim Scott, for example, who says he smokes pot to combat unipolar mania -- which he describes as a chemical imbalance of the brain that makes him constantly manic. No pharmaceutical, he claims, has helped as much as marijuana.<P>

"When I smoke a joint like this," Scott says, holding up a smoldering hand-wrapped reefer, "I won't call a travel agent and book a flight to Hawaii [for no reason]. I'll go over to my bed, lie down and cocoon. As my doctor says, 'Give him a joint. It keeps his mouth shut.'"<P>

"Mama Tee," a former nurse whose proper name is Latangalia Carr, says she uses pot to counteract the ill effects of taking 12 pills a day for the HIV she says she contracted from a needle stick years ago.<P>

"No way in the world -- as sick as they make me -- that I could take them all without my marijuana," the spicy 51-year-old says matter-of-factly. "After I say, 'Thank you, Lord,' each morning for letting me be alive with my six T-cells, the first thing I do is smoke my marijuana so I can eat and take my anti -virals. If I don't smoke, I don't eat, I don't take my anti -virals and I die. It's a vicious circle."<P>

SICK OR DRUNK?<BR>
Yet what constitutes an illness treatable by marijuana remains debatable too. Prop 215 left the question wide open, allowing treatment for cancer, anorexia, AIDS, chronic pain, spasticity, glaucoma, arthritis, migraines and "any other illness for which marijuana provides relief."<P>

Most clubs interpret the statute broadly, approving diagnoses for things as questionable as stress, insomnia, alcoholism and drug addiction. While admitting that most voters probably didn't envision alcoholics as the recipients of medical marijuana, club operators point out that alcoholism is an officially recognized disease.<P>

"All you have to do is look back at the medical literature from the 19th century to see the effectiveness of cannabis substitution for alcohol," says Dr. Mikuriya of Berkeley. "It's a very good substitute clinically. Anytime you want to take a drink, turn on [to pot] instead and take your antabuse pill."<P>

No less an advocate than Peron himself uses marijuana to control drinking. "I'm an alcoholic," he says flatly. "If it wasn't for marijuana, I'd probably be dead."<P>

Buyers' clubs might face a backlash in the next month, though. There is talk in Sacramento of Republican legislation aimed at curbing the number of illnesses covered by Prop 215. Very likely, treating alcoholics with marijuana -- a process called "harm reduction" -- wouldn't make the cut.<P>

That would be especially detrimental to clubs like CHAMP, whose founder, Hern ndez, has fully embraced the concept in hope of weaning addicts -- particularly the gays who make up a good percentage of his clientele -- off more serious drugs.<P>

"Speed and heroin are big problems in our community," Hern ndez says.<P>

Even on the question of using pot to help break addictions to stronger drugs, there are differences of opinion among the clubs. Hudson and Peron agree with Hern ndez, but Jones of the Oakland club isn't ready to start authorizing marijuana for addicts, even though he recognizes that alcoholism can lead to a painful death.<P>

"We're kind of on the border of whether we're going to push the envelope on harm reduction," says Jones, whose 800 -member club is composed mostly of people with HIV or AIDS. "We're going to wait for the new year to come in and feel it out."<P>

The language of Prop 215 gives doctors a lot of discretion.<P>

"The proposition says 'any ailment' that might be helped by [marijuana]," DA Hallinan says. "That could be the famous hangnail, but I know that [Lungren] is thinking about much more serious illness and I think that's what people were thinking about [when they voted], but that's not what the Prop says. I'd be satisfied if it's decided between the doctor and the patient."<P>

But few people on either side of the issue expect anything to be resolved without going to court. A club will have to be charged with illegal sales or distribution, they say, or a doctor will be accused of dispensing an unlawful substance.<P>

Only then will it be possible to find out whether Prop 215's mandate by the people outweighs the federal government's power to outlaw certain substances.<P>

Doctors might be safe, some attorneys say, because approving or recommending the use of marijuana might not technically violate federal laws prohibiting the "facilitation" of unauthorized drugs. On the other hand, says one lawyer, buyers' clubs might be vulnerable outside certain bounds because "Prop 215 does not clearly allow distribution."<P>

Not surprisingly, though, there are doctors and club members who would welcome a chance to serve as a test defendant -- people like Berkeley's Mikuriya and buyers' club member Eugene Morris -- a walking artifact from the Haight-Ashbury of the '60s who says he uses pot for asthma, emphysema and cancer.<P>

"I'm almost 60 years old and I've been [smoking pot medically] for 10 years," the gray-haired, ponytailed Morris says one day at Flower Therapy. "I'd love for them to arrest me because I'd fight them. I'd have to buy on the streets [if not for the clubs] and risk arrest anyway."<P>

Buyers' club operators hope it doesn't come to that. But in the face of almost institutionalized resistance to any legalization of marijuana, they aren't holding their breath.<P>

"We're trying to give birth to a new industry," says Entwistle, of Californians for Compassionate Care, "and [the government's] trying to put us in the paradigm of trying to get away with a crime. That's not right."<P>

SIDEBAR: CITIES MOVING AHEAD ON PROP 215<P>

By Mike McKee<P>

As the state and federal governments intensified their opposition this week to medicinal marijuana, San Francisco and Oakland city officials quietly worked with pro-pot forces on ways to implement Proposition 215.<P>

Negotiations aimed at establishing a legal framework to distribute pot have been under way since shortly after voters approved the medical marijuana measure on Nov. 5, according to spokespersons for both cities and marijuana buyers' club operators and their attorneys. The hope, they said, is to implement uniform guidelines that will curb potential abuses and provide a foundation for medical necessity defenses for users who get arrested for possession.<P>

"It's a medical issue," said San Francisco District Attorney Terence Hallinan. "So I've asked the Health Department to come up with protocols [and] I've approached the Board of Supervisors about a licensing provision that would allow me to [regulate] the means by which persons can receive marijuana under Prop 215."<P>

Hallinan said he would demand that buyers' clubs verify illnesses, have "strong rules" regarding children's access to marijuana, and abide by other state and local laws.<P>

"I have had one meeting with [club operators]," he said. "I'm aware of their feelings and positions."<P>

Hallinan said he has asked that the Health Department have its recommendations ready in the next week or so.<P>

Pillsbury Madison & Sutro partner Thomas Loran III, who provides pro bono representation to a club called CHAMP -- Cannabis Helping Alleviate Medical Problems -- said Hallinan has assured clubs he won't prosecute, "provided that our clients conduct themselves in a responsible manner."<P>

Loran said it's essential that the clubs work with Hallinan "to establish ways to enable us to have the requisite accountability."<P>

Buyers' clubs in San Francisco and Oakland already have provided members with cards bearing telephone numbers that police can call to verify medical status. "They call me and I'll come running with their paperwork," said John Hudson, founder of San Francisco's Flower Therapy buyers' club.<P>

"We're sort of at the point that the use of medical marijuana is a low [arrest] priority," said Michele Molotsky, chief of staff for Oakland Councilman Nate Miley. "Now we want to look at transportation and distribution. But I have no idea what we're going to do."<P>

Heller Ehrman White & McAuliffe partner Jonathan Hayden, who's working pro bono on implementation issues with a San Francisco-based policy research institute called The Lindesmith Center, praised the local efforts.<P>

"It's clear that they are trying to set these up to be as well documented and clearly run on a medical or pharmaceutical model as possible," Hayden said. The Lindesmith Center, he added, is focusing on ways to protect doctors who recommend marijuana for patients.<P>

"There's a lot of uncertainty out there [in regard to doctors' risks]," he said, "and all we're trying to do is figure out where the best place is to provide some support so this statute can be implemented in a way the people intended it to be."<P>

Meanwhile, buyers' clubs are proceeding cautiously, with attorneys advising them not only to keep good records, but also to account for every pound of their marijuana and to have all their routine daily affairs in order.<P>

"What I've done is take an extremely conservative approach," said San Francisco solo practitioner Matthew Kumin, who advises Flower Therapy. "I'm trying to make sure that like any small business they comply with all the things all small businesses have to deal with -- all of the mundane things that otherwise could be a source, or an excuse, for a government authority to shut an organization down."<P>

The leaders of local buyers' clubs said they plan to continue working with Bay Area officials because it fits their plans.<P>

"We have no national ambitions. Californians for Compassionate Use does not plan to do an initiative in Ohio next year," said John Entwistle Jr., legislative advocate for the San Francisco-based pro-medical marijuana organization. "Our whole goal is to influence the world by local action and to let the world see the benefit to California."<P>

<H2>Firm Has Friends on Both Sides of Apple-Next Merger</H2> <P>

By Krysten Crawford<BR>
<I>The Recorder</I><BR>
January 6, 1997<P>

Apple Computer Inc.'s recent reunion with co-founder Steven Jobs and his company, Next Software Inc., was a prime example of how quickly business alliances change in Silicon Valley.<P>

But the $400 million merger also illustrates how lawyers often change sides in the volatile high-tech world.<P>

Next's lawyers in the merger -- Wilson, Sonsini, Goodrich & Rosati -- had taken Apple public in 1980 and were on hand when the company ousted Jobs in 1985.<P>

Later in 1985, Apple declined to waive a conflict when Jobs tried to hire Wilson, Sonsini to incorporate Next.<P>

"Apple felt it was a conflict and so did I," said Wilson, Sonsini partner Larry Sonsini.<P>

Though Wilson, Sonsini has continued to advise Apple on corporate and other matters, within the past two years the firm has been allowed to step in as Next's chief outside corporate firm.<P>

For instance, Wilson, Sonsini was gearing up to take Next public when the Apple courtship scuttled that plan. In addition, Sonsini now serves as a director of Pixar Inc., a computer animation company launched by Jobs, and also represents Pixar in its corporate dealings.<P>

So when it came time to choose teams to represent the two companies in merger talks, Sonsini's firm was the obvious choice for Next. And this time, Apple did not object to Wilson, Sonsini's role.<P>

Apple, for its part, turned to the San Francisco office of New York's Shearman & Sterling.<P>

Shearman & Sterling first represented Apple in securities litigation a few years ago. More recently, Apple has been using the San Francisco office for some of its big corporate needs, including a much-needed $660 million private placement completed last summer.<P>

"Shearman & Sterling has been representing us in significant corporate matters for a couple of years now," said Susan Thorner, Apple's director of corporate law and a player in the Apple-Next talks.<P>

Despite its work for Apple, Shearman & Sterling also has indirect links to Next: The firm was acting as underwriters' counsel in preparations for Next's initial public offering.<P>

Nancy Heinen, the general counsel at Next, said Shearman & Sterling requested an informal waiver and that she was more than happy to oblige, given the time pressure to cut a deal once talks accelerated early last month. An agreement was announced Dec. 20.<P>

"I don't think we could have done the deal that quickly if we had to add new players to the team," said Heinen, who worked on the transaction with associate general counsel Christopher Palermo.<P>

Besides the changes in outside counsel, the deal also marks a turning point for Heinen, who joined Next three years ago from Tandem Computers Inc. She said she does not expect to join Apple's in-house corps when the merger, which is awaiting federal antitrust approval, reaches its expected conclusion later this month.<P>

"I'm going to close the deal and assist in any transition matters," said Heinen. "Then I'm going to play with my kids for a few months."<P>

<H2>Tobacco Takes a Hit</H2><P>

By Steven Fromm<BR>
<I>The Connecticut Law Tribune</I><BR>
January 6, 1997<P>

For the first time in five months, Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal needn't cast a worried glance at his legal flank in his ongoing war with the tobacco industry.<P>

In a decision described by lawyers involved in the case as a first of its kind, U.S. District Court Judge Peter C. Dorsey dismissed a pre-emptive suit filed by four tobacco industry giants seeking to block Blumenthal from filing a $1 billion suit against them.<P>

In granting Blumenthal's motion to dismiss Philip Morris Inc. v. Blumenthal, Dorsey made it clear that federal courts have no business interfering with state litigation involving an "important state interest."<P>

Dorsey also wasted no time in explaining why he dismissed Philip Morris, while earlier this year a U.S. district judge in Massachusetts did not dismiss a similar action -- Philip Morris v. Harshbarger -- against the Bay State's attorney general.<P>

In Connecticut's action, Blumenthal is using the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA) and state antitrust laws to recoup damages. Dorsey deems those "important state interests" that federal courts have no right to pre-empt. The Massachusetts case did not allege similar consumer protection and antitrust violations.<P>

Also, Dorsey took the time in his nine-page decision -- made on Dec. 23 and released on Dec. 26 -- to blast the tobacco companies that filed Philip Morris for mis-citing cases and using "faulty logic."<P>

Philip Morris Inc. v. Blumenthal was filed in U.S. District Court in Bridgeport on June 28 by Philip Morris Inc. and Lorillard Tobacco Co., both based in New York, the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. of Winston-Salem, N.C., and the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. of Louisville, Ky.<P>

The suit was clearly a pre-emptive strike, filed just weeks after Blumenthal announced his intention of filing his own suit against the tobacco industry to recoup state funds spent on smoking-related illnesses, including Medicaid expenditures.<P>

The tobacco companies charged in their suit that Blumenthal's impending action would have an "enormous and far-reaching" impact that could slam the industry with a "retroactive, unprecedented and devastating financial burden."<P>

The foursome contended that Connecticut's planned suit would "significantly impede interstate commerce" of a legal product -- cigarettes.<P>

Similar actions were filed in Texas, Massachusetts and Maryland. All four states have filed suits against the tobacco industry.<P>

Describing the tobacco companies' suit as an "effort to bully and intimidate my office," Blumenthal, aided by a small coalition of Connecticut law firms chosen by him, filed a $1 billion suit against the tobacco industry on July 18.<P>

Blumenthal's action, Connecticut v. Philip Morris Inc., is the largest civil action ever filed by the state.<P>

Connecticut won an early-round victory on Oct. 15, when U.S. District Judge Janet B. Arterton denied a motion by the tobacco companies to have Philip Morris tried in federal court, instead of where it is now pending -- in the state Superior Court in Litchfield before Judge Michael R. Sheldon.<P>

JUST THE BEGINNING<BR>
Dorsey's decision may be a clear victory for Blumenthal and his coalition, but it is far from the end of the battle.<P>

"The most important thing is that the essence of our position is that we are going to defend this case," says Michael M. York, of the Washington, D.C.-based Wehner & York, which represents Philip Morris Inc.<P>

"We honestly believe that there is no legal merit at all to the legal claims asserted by the attorney general," York says. "One of the most profound constitutional issues of due process is do tobacco companies enjoy the due-process rights at all in these types of lawsuits."<P>

York asserts that "stripped of all their exotic consumer protection and antitrust claims, the attorney general's action alleges one thing: The [tobacco] companies are to be held liable for alleged injuries to third parties on the basis of one act -- the lawful sale of a legal product."<P>

David S. Golub, a partner with Stamford-based Silver, Golub & Teitell -- one of the firms working with the state in Philip Morris -- sees the issue differently.<P>

"The issue is not the legal right to something, they [the tobacco companies] do have that right," Golub says. "The issue is whether they have misrepresented the nature of the product, and if they have been manipulating the addictive nature of the products. If you violate the law in the way you market it, you can be held liable."<P>

Golub is now looking forward to the battle in state Superior Court.<P>

"What we really think will happen now is that the case in state court will move ahead," Golub says. "We are getting 200,000 documents from the defendants. They will start coming in in the beginning of January, and we are really going to litigate the case aggressively."<P>

The other Connecticut firms to make up the coalition, in addition to Golub's, are Waterbury's Carmody & Torrance and Stamford's Emmett & Glander. The Philadelphia firm of Berger & Montague is also part of the coalition.<P>

"The linchpin of this powerful and profound precedent is the court's conclusion that an important state interest is at stake," Attorney General Richard Blumenthal notes in a written statement released right after Dorsey's decision. "This court is the first to reach that conclusion, which is absolutely correct and critical to litigation around the country."<P>

But the tobacco companies are also still hoping to carry their fight -- or at least a part of it -- to the federal courts.<P>

"We want the federal [constitutional] issues [raised in Philip Morris v. Blumenthal] decided in a federal court," York says. "What we are doing is starting to analyze [Dorsey's] ruling to determine if we should seek review in the Court of Appeals. This case is similar to the one in Massachusetts, and that judge reached the opposite result. If necessary, we will have the opportunity to have the issue resolved in that court."<P>

But Dorsey's ruling is blunt enough to be of some reassurance to Blumenthal and company.<P>

Right off the bat, Dorsey notes in his decision that the "tobacco companies' action raises the issue of federal court interference with pending state legislation."<P>

Dorsey points to a key 1971 U.S. Supreme Court decision, Younger v. Harris, which notes that "since the beginning of this country's history Congress has, subject to few exceptions, manifested a desire to permit state courts to try state cases free from interference by federal courts."<P>

The Younger court also ruled that "the normal thing to do when federal courts are asked to enjoin pending proceedings in state courts is not to issue such injunctions."<P>

However, Dorsey also notes that "[a]lthough Younger addressed federal actions to enjoin state criminal proceedings, the same principles of comity mandate extreme caution before enjoining certain kinds of state civil proceedings as well."<P>

Abstention under Younger is appropriate when: "1) there is an ongoing state proceeding; 2) an important state interest is implicated; and 3) the plaintiff has an avenue open for review of constitutional claims in the state court," Dorsey states, citing a 1992 decision, Hansel v. Town Court for Town of Springfield, from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit.<P>

"When these conditions are met," Dorsey notes,  "abstention is obligatory."<P>

"There is clearly an ongoing state proceeding in the present case," Dorsey adds. "The question is whether this element requires that the state proceedings be brought before the federal action. The typical scenario, as in Younger, is that the state action came first."<P>

Still, Dorsey notes that in a 1975 case, Hicks v. Miranda, the U.S. Supreme Court held that Younger also applies in cases where the federal action was filed pre-emptively.<P>

TOBACCO'S TACTIC<BR>
But the tobacco companies argue that a 1974 U.S. Supreme Court case, Steffel v. Thompson -- not Hicks -- is the key case that applies to Philip Morris Inc. v. Blumenthal.<P>

Under Steffel, federal courts need not abstain under Younger if there is no pending state proceeding.<P>

"However," Dorsey writes, "Steffel applies when there is no pending state proceeding. The Supreme Court in Hicks specifically distinguished that scenario from one in which there is a pending state proceeding which, in a race to the courthouse, happened to be filed second."<P>

Dorsey notes that in Philip Morris, the tobacco companies attempt to distinguish Hicks on several other grounds. They argue that Hicks applies only to criminal, not civil, proceedings.<P>

Dorsey doesn't buy it.<P>

"This argument is without merit," he writes. "As discussed above, Younger applies to certain types of civil actions. Hicks applies to civil proceedings to the same extent that Younger does."<P>

Finally, the tobacco companies argue that "comity works both ways": Respect for federalism would have the state court, not the federal court, abstain. To bolster their argument, the tobacco companies cite a 1995 case out of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit, Chaulk Services v. Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination.<P>

Dorsey pricks this legal balloon as well.<P>

"In Chaulk, the state administrative action interfered with a federal statutory and administrative system constitutionally adopted by [c]ongress," Dorsey writes. "There is no such federal administrative pre-emption in the present action. Accordingly, there is an `ongoing proceeding' for Younger purposes."<P>

EYEING STATE INTERESTS<BR>
Dorsey adds muscle to his ruling by noting that abstention by the federal courts is "proper under Younger in civil cases only if the proceedings implicate `important state interests,' " under yet another U.S. Supreme Court decision, 1982's Middlesex Ethics Comm. v. Garden State Bar Association.<P>

"The attorney general's claims under the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA) and under Connecticut antitrust law are important state interests," Dorsey rules. "Both claims are under statutory schemes which contemplate civil enforcement actions by state authorities to effect state policy."<P>

Dorsey adds that "[t]hese laws are mechanisms for the state to enforce its important interest in fair trade in Connecticut."<P>

The tobacco companies urged Dorsey to follow Harshbarger, the Massachusetts case. Again, Dorsey completely rejects their argument.<P>

"The Massachusetts District Court declined to abstain under Younger because it did not find an important state interest," Dorsey notes. "The Massachusetts Attorney General's action, which sought reimbursement for Medicaid expenditures, was found to be `classically in the nature of subrogation,' and accordingly not an important state interest.<P>

"However, Harshbarger must be distinguished because the Massachusetts Attorney General's suit in state court did not allege violations of state unfair trade practice and antitrust law, as does the Connecticut state court action," he writes. "It is therefore unnecessary to address the merits and applicability of Harshbarger, since the Attorney General's CUTPA and antitrust claims do implicate an important state interest."<P>

The tobacco companies attempt, in the words of Dorsey, to "gloss over" the absence of unfair trade practice and antitrust claims in the Massachusetts case by pointing out that the underlying state complaints in the two cases are "predicated on virtually identical factual allegations."<P>

"This argument misses the point," Dorsey notes. "The existence of an important state interest for Younger purposes does not depend on whether the relief sought is monetary or injunctive. Rather, it depends on the nature of the claim brought in the underlying state court action."<P>

The tobacco companies also argue that claims in the federal action, which seek injunctions against imposition of liability for future, as opposed to past, sales of tobacco, should not be barred under Younger.<P>

This argument, which Dorsey describes as "puzzling," draws the judge's sharpest comments.<P>

"This argument is based on mis-cited cases and faulty logic," he says. ". . . There furthermore is no logical base to this argument. Nothing indicates that the state court would take the unprecedented step of imposing liability for sales which have not yet occurred." Powerful or Procedural?<P>

"The CUTPA count made a really big difference [between the outcome of the Connecticut and Massachusetts cases], and there wasn't an antitrust count in the Massachusetts case, either," Golub says.<P>

"The judge up there said, `This is just a case for Medicaid funds, it's just like any other case for money, so we don't need to dismiss this [the tobacco companies]' case," he adds. "We were able to say, even if you think the Massachusetts case is right, ours is not just a case for money. We are seeking broad remedial relief under important sovereign statutes."<P>

Edward F. Hennessey, of Hartford's Robinson & Cole, which is representing R.J. Reynolds, notes that, "I think it was a surprise to some in the sense that it was a different outcome than what occurred in Massachusetts."<P>

"But as far as having a real impact, I don't think it will," Hennessey adds. "Our case is before Judge Sheldon, and no one on either side questions his ability to handle this. [The federal case] was strictly a procedural decision. It did not resolve anything other than a matter of form."<P>

Francis H. Morrison III, of the Hartford office of Day, Berry & Howard, which is representing Brown & Williamson, says that, "I think we are all going to have to study very carefully what he [Dorsey] had to say, and consider where to go from here in the federal action."<P>

Morrison notes that "Judge Dorsey obviously felt the allegations under CUTPA and the Connecticut antitrust statutes made a different. That was really the linchpin decision."<P>

<H2>The Tale of Victims' Rights</H2><P>

By Paul G. Cassell and Robert F. Hoyt<Br> 
<I>Legal Times</I><Br> 
December 30, 1996 <P>

The victims' rights movement saw substantial legislative victories in 1996. Voters in eight states approved victims' rights amendments to their constitutions, bringing the total number of states in which victims have constitutional rights to 28. Congress followed suit by introducing a proposed federal constitutional amendment and enacting legislation that reinforced victims' rights to view proceedings related to the prosecution of those charged with crimes against them, even when the trial is moved to another district. <P>

Implementation of these legislative successes, however, left much to be desired. If 1996 was a winning year for victims at the voting booth and in the legislatures, it was all too often a losing year for them in court. In a variety of cases, victims who asserted their newfound rights saw their interests subordinated to the perceived convenience of the courts and the dubious constitutional claims of defendants. <P>

If the victims' rights movement is to make significant progress in 1997, it will have to change the mind- set of criminal justice professionals so that they recognize that victims have important interests and a role to play in the criminal justice process. The only way to guarantee that progress is passage and ratification of the federal Victims Rights Amendment. <P>

The genesis of the success of the victims movement can be traced to the 1982 Final Report of the President's Task Force on Victims of Crime, which criticized the criminal justice system for its neglectful treatment of victims and recommended a range of proposals designed to confer rights on victims. In the years since, the states and Congress have enacted a variety of measures adopting these recommendations. <P>

The state constitutional amendments are a prime example, as is the federal Victims Rights and Restitution Act of 1990 (commonly referred to as the Victims Bill of Rights), which gives crime victims the right to be notified of and present at court proceedings, and to receive information about the conviction, sentencing, imprisonment, and release of the offender. This year, Congress enacted legislation providing for mandatory restitution to crime victims and closed circuit television broadcast of trial proceedings moved far from their original location. <P>

COURTS SLOW TO CHANGE <br>
Notwithstanding these and other important legislative enactments, the pace of acceptance by the judicial system has been agonizingly slow. The trials of Oklahoma City bombing suspects Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols present a high-profile example. Perhaps the most surprising decision to the hundreds of victims of the bombing was the court's ruling on "the rule" on witnesses (Fed. R. Evid. 615). Under the rule, the court held, "victim impact" witnesses at sentencing would not be permitted to attend the trial proceedings in Denver or to watch them in Oklahoma City over closed circuit television. <P>
The victims and the government moved for reconsideration, directing the court to the Victims Bill of Rights, which gives victims the right to be present at "all public court proceedings related to the offense, unless the court determines that testimony by the victim would be materially affected if the victim heard other testimony at trial." Both the victims and the government noted that no finding of material impact had been made, and argued that no such finding could be made with respect to victims whose only testimony would relate the impact of the crime on their own lives. <P>

The court rejected requests for reconsideration, holding that the victims lacked standing even to assert their rights under the federal statute and concluding that the provisions of the statute had no bearing on the court's authority to exclude victims. The affected victims, joined by the government, have sought interlocutory review in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit (Marsha Kight, et al. v. Hon. Richard P. Matsch, No. 96-1484), with an expedited decision expected in the next month or two. <P>

Other rulings in the Oklahoma City case reflect this same apparent disinterest in the rights that Congress has accorded crime victims. For example, the judge ruled that the defendants would receive separate trials because certain incriminating statements by Nichols were inadmissible against McVeigh. The court quickly skipped over the fact that this ruling would leave the victims' lives on hold for not one long and difficult trial, but two. In determining that two trials were the appropriate result, the court also paid little attention to alternatives that would have eased the burden on the victims while protecting the defendants' rights, such as impaneling two separate juries and excusing the relevant jury from the courtroom on the rare trial days when testimony admissible against only one defendant was presented. <P>

Similarly, in ordering that the trial be relocated to Denver (as opposed to other appropriate locales closer to Oklahoma City), the court apparently paid little attention to the effect on the victims' right to be present. As a result, any victim wishing to attend even a portion of either trial will have to travel hundreds of miles simply to get to the courthouse. Once there, they would find only 12 seats reserved for the hundreds of victims. (The same number were reserved for the families of the two defendants; more than three times as many were reserved for representatives of the media.) <P>

As a partial response to the victims' inability to attend the hearings in Denver, Congress adopted the Televised Proceedings for Crime Victims provision, which requires that a trial court must provide for closed circuit broadcast of trial proceedings held more than 350 miles from the location of the crime (as in the Oklahoma City bombing case). But even this express mandate met with little enthusiasm. It appears that the broadcast will go to a courtroom with an approximate capacity of 150 persons (rather than the largest courtroom in the local federal courthouse or a large auditorium at a nearby military base), and will not be activated until opening arguments. The result is that, despite federal legislation giving victims the right to be present at all proceedings, hundreds of Oklahoma City victims have been, and will continue to be, unable to do so. <P>

Johnson v. Rodriguez (No. 95-50879), a case pending before the 5th Circuit, provides another illustration of the obstacles facing victims. Johnson involves a Texas statute that allows victims to submit confidential statements to the Board of Pardons and Paroles concerning the impact of a crime. It appears that victim statements have had some effect, as sentences served by violent offenders in Texas lengthened in the years after enactment of the statute. <P>

But in a challenge to the law filed by various prisoners, a federal magistrate struck it down as a violation of the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment because the Parole Board tended, more often than not, to deny parole after receiving input from a victim. In other words, because the victims' input had some real-world effect, the magistrate determined that the statute allowing the input was unconstitutional. The state's appeal of this ruling was heard by the 5th Circuit in November, and the court's decision in 1997 will perhaps be another bellwether in the movement for victims' rights. <P>

END THE UNCERTAINTY <br>
The reluctance of courts to recognize those rights already accorded to crime victims has led to a nationwide cry for an amendment to the U.S. Constitution that would leave no doubt that victims are entitled to fair treatment in the criminal justice process. Proposed by a bipartisan coalition in Congress, the idea has been endorsed by President Bill Clinton and was a plank in the recent platforms of the Republican and Democratic parties. <P>

Once ratified, the proposed Victims Rights Amendment will establish a national "floor" for victims' rights and end the uncertainty that victims now face when they attempt to assert their rights. The amendment will guarantee such basic rights as that to be notified about court hearings, to attend those hearings, and to speak at appropriate points in the process (including at hearings to determine bail, sentencing, or parole). It will also guarantee victims the right to an order of restitution from a convicted offender and to notice before the offender is released from prison. These rights are critical to crime victims and do not conflict with the established constitutional rights of criminal defendants. <P>

The Victims Rights Amendment has already attracted the kind of strong support that is necessary to amend the Constitution. With endorsements from the president and important members of both parties in Congress, and companion amendments in place in more than half the states, the likelihood of passage and ratification seems high. If so, 1997 will be remembered as the year in which our criminal justice system's appalling disregard for the interests of victims was finally brought to an end. <P>

<H2>New Gingrich Counsel: A Rough Welcome</H2><P>

By Don J. DeBenedictis <Br> 
<I>Legal Times</I><Br> 
December 30, 1996 <P>

House Speaker Newt Gingrich's new lawyer in his ethics investigation, J. Randolph Evans, is a longtime Gingrich friend and adviser who is no stranger to tough political fights. His newest assignment may be his toughest yet, as evidenced by the fact that he began drawing fire before he'd even settled into the job. <P>

On Dec. 19, Gingrich announced that Evans would take over duties as the speaker's lead counsel for the ongoing congressional ethics probe, replacing Jan Baran, a veteran Washington ethics and election-law specialist. It did not take long for an old Gingrich foe to take aim at the speaker's choice. <P>

David Worley, an Atlanta lawyer whom Gingrich narrowly defeated in his 1990 re-election campaign, says that Evans may be unable to fulfill his new role because he could become a witness in the House Ethics Committee investigation of Gingrich. <P>

"It is surprising to me that as a potential witness, he could be in a position to represent Gingrich," says Worley. <P>

Evans, who heads the professional negligence defense group at Atlanta's Arnall Golden & Gregory, was Gingrich's campaign chairman in the 1990 race. Worley's charge of a possible conflict grows out of an affidavit that Evans submitted early this year in a suit filed by the Federal Election Commission against Gingrich's political action committee, GOPAC. <P>

In the affidavit, Evans states that the 1990 campaign committee never received "any support, directly or indirectly, financial or otherwise from GOPAC. . . ." <P>

The two-year-old House Ethics Committee investigation of the speaker has focused on charges that Gingrich may have misused money donated to charitable foundations for political purposes, and misled the committee about a college course he taught. <P>

Since he has signed an affidavit related to the case -- denying charges that GOPAC provided "Newt support" to Gingrich's campaign-Evans' testimony could be needed, says Worley, who was an associate at Arnall Golden in the 1980s. <P>

Evans and a Gingrich spokesman did not return calls seeking comment for this article.<P>

But Ralph Lotkin, a former chief counsel to the ethics panel, says the affidavit could indeed raise "interesting conflict problems" -- if it is introduced before the ethics committee "and is in some respects potentially relevant to the committee's investigation of alleged wrongdoing by the speaker." Lotkin is now the managing partner of D.C.'s Cochran & Lotkin. (Lotkin's partner, Johnnie Cochran, is a commentator on Court TV, which has editorial and business ties to Legal Times.) <P>

Lotkin says the document could "place Mr. Evans in the position of being both the attorney-advocate on behalf of Mr. Gingrich and a witness who could supply information potentially detrimental to his client's interests." Lotkin worked on the ethics probe that led to the fall of former Speaker Jim Wright (D-Texas) in 1989. <P>

AFFIDAVIT: GOPAC HURT CAMPAIGN <br>
In the affidavit, Evans said GOPAC not only did not help the Gingrich re-election race, but was actually an "impediment" because it took Gingrich away from the campaign and the district. "His absence from the district was a major contributing factor for the 974-vote margin in the 1990 election," Evans declared. <P>

The affidavit is not dated, but the attestation from a notary public is dated Jan. 2, 1996. The suit, Federal Election Commission v. GOPAC, was dismissed earlier this year by U.S. District Judge Louis Oberdorfer, who said that the FEC had failed to prove that GOPAC had violated federal election law. <P>

William Kitchens, chairman of the management committee at Arnall Golden, says the firm was aware of Evans' filing of the affidavit, and that "proper procedures were followed." He would not comment further on the affidavit or any potential conflict, or on Evans' selection as Gingrich's new ethics defender. <P>

Baran and his firm, D.C.'s Wiley, Rein & Fielding, resigned their representation of Gingrich amid reports that Gingrich had blamed Baran for alleged misstatements about GOPAC made to the ethics committee. <P>

Late last week, however, Baran, former general counsel to the Republican National Committee, and Tony Blankley, Gingrich's press secretary, released a joint statement "to avoid a growing misconception," asserting that Baran and the firm "continue to represent Newt Gingrich"; though "they are no longer representing him directly before the Ethics Committee or its Special Counsel," the statement reads, Baran and the firm "are continuing to assist Newt and others in that proceeding." <P>

This is not Evans' first foray into Washington's ethics battles; he was a key player in an earlier ethics challenge to a speaker of the House-when Gingrich filed an ethics complaint in 1988 against then House Speaker Wright. <P>

Jeffrey Smith of Atlanta's Katz, Smith & Cohen was the head of the malpractice defense group at Arnall Golden at the time; Evans brought him in to help Gingrich go after Wright, Smith says. Smith says he wrote the complaint against Wright. <P>

Two or three other complaints had been drafted but failed to attract support from other Republican House members. But 76 Republicans signed the new complaint within an hour of its being put forward, Smith says. <P>

In a 1988 profile of Evans in the Fulton County Daily Report, a Legal Times affiliate, Gingrich was quoted as calling him "clearly the finest general talent in the Republican Party in Georgia today." <P>

The two met when Evans was a student and Gingrich a geography professor at West Georgia College in Carrollton. Evans worked on the future speaker's first campaign for Congress, and by 1988 was the chairman of the Republican Party in Gingrich's 6th District. Evans even considered running for governor in 1990. <P>

However, he retreated somewhat from heavy political activity as his practice grew, according to partner Charles Huddleston. Evans became head of his practice group at Arnall Golden when Smith left the firm in 1992, according to Smith. <P>

Evans' practice now focuses on work for major insurance carriers, according to partner Jonathan Golden-including advising on coverage in malpractice claims against lawyers, corporate directors and officers, accountants, and engineers. <P>

Golden says Evans travels extensively for his practice and also often speaks on professional negligence. He leads an annual seminar on malpractice defense and is the author of a book on legal malpractice defense now in its fourth edition, according to Golden. <P>

Golden describes his partner as "very analytical" and extremely hard-working. <P>

Evans, 38, offered a similar description of himself in the 1988 Daily Report profile: "My reputation is of being a total and complete workaholic, which is what I am." <P>

He grew up in Warner Robins and attended West Georgia College and the University of Georgia School of Law. <P>

He worked hard there, too, recalls Marietta lawyer and Democratic activist Robert Kahn, who has known him since they were debate opponents in 10th grade. <P>

"He was on moot court and law review at the same time," Kahn recalls. <P>

Kahn says that as an attorney, Evans is aggressive and gives "good attention to detail." <P>

As far as Evans' new client is concerned, Kahn says that Evans has known the speaker for years and knows politics. Says Kahn: "The speaker needs somebody he has full confidence in . . <P>

<H2>Escape Routes Slamming Shut For Inmates on Death Row</H2>  <P>

By Naftali Bendavid<BR>
<I>The Recorder</I><BR>
December 27, 1996<P>

WASHINGTON -- This was the year the hangman got serious.<P>

Twenty years after the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty, impatient lawmakers in April drastically cut back on death row appeals. Then, for good measure, Congress did away with the 20 federal law offices that help represent the condemned.<P>

Law-and-order enthusiasts are cheering those actions, saying the system is finally free to punish murderers as demanded by justice -- and the people. But advocates for death row inmates warn that the slashing of safeguards is pushing the nation toward an indiscriminate jump in executions, and that inevitably some who die will be innocent.<P>

"It's become clear over the past 20 years that we can have the death penalty or we can have enforcement of the Constitution, but we can't have both," says George Kendall, an attorney with the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund Inc. "The question is, which one are we going to have? And for now, it seems clear that our leaders have said we're going to have the death penalty."<P>

But conservatives insist the streamlining was necessary. "The American people were terribly frustrated with the administration of the criminal justice system," says Paul Kamenar, executive legal director of the nonprofit Washington Legal Foundation. "It is terribly unresponsive to the victim and is skewed extremely on the side of the criminal and the defendant. This is a step in the right direction."<P>

While California carried out two executions this year, more than in any single year since 1962, the death machine nationwide actually slowed a little in 1996 as courts wrestled with the new law: Forty-five people were put to death (no executions are scheduled between now and year's end), compared to last year's 56. But many expect the changes will cause the numbers to soar in coming years, perhaps to more than 100 a year. Currently, roughly 3,200 people reside on death row.<P>

As in the past few years, lethal injection was by far the leading method of execution; electrocutions were a distant second; and there was a hanging in Delaware and a firing squad shooting in Utah.<P>

NEW LAW HASTENS DEATH<BR>
The year's most dramatic development on the capital punishment front was the passage of the law reforming <I>habeas corpus</I>, the process that allows inmates to argue in federal court that they were unconstitutionally tried. Liberals say <I>habeas</I> is crucial to save innocent people from execution; conservatives complain that it is abused by inmates who file multiple appeals in an attempt to stave off their date with death.<P>

The new law -- signed in April after years of conservative crusading -- allows only one appeal in federal court, except under extraordinary circumstances, and the appeal must be filed within one year.<P>

"The <I>habeas</I> bill is one of the all-time most important reinstitutions of criminal law," says Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. "It was about time we put a stop to the endless, frivolous appeals of justly imposed sentences."<P>

Marc Klaas, whose daughter Polly was sexually abused and murdered in Northern California by Richard Allen Davis, says the new law could shorten by seven years the time he must wait to witness Davis' death. "[Davis] admitted he sexually relieves himself twice a day thinking about victims of his past crimes," Klaas says. "That means Polly will be continually victimized for as long as he lives."<P>

But death penalty opponents say the new law means there is a real danger of the innocent being killed. Criminal trials, they say, are often horribly botched, especially if the defendant is poor. State judges, sensitive to the political winds, often do not correct matters, these activists add, so federal <I>habeas</I> is crucial.<P>

Take Lloyd Schlup, who has been on death row in Missouri since 1984. Schlup was convicted of killing a fellow inmate while serving time on another crime. Years later, a new lawyer found that several eyewitnesses, plus a prison videotape, corroborated Schlup's claim of innocence. In 1995, the U.S. Supreme Court, through the <I>habeas</I> process, gave Schlup another chance to prove his innocence.<P>

Under the new law, Schlup's appeal would not have been allowed, according to Sean O'Brien, executive director of the Public Interest Litigation Clinic in Kansas City, Mo.<P>

"Schlup would be killed under the new statute," says O'Brien, who represented Schlup. "But he's innocent. That's where the law leaves us."<P>

It is difficult at this early stage to find inmates who have already been executed solely due to the new law's speedier timetable. The courts had been showing less patience with <I>habeas</I> petitions anyway. And many cases in which the new law might have come into play are tied up in court.<P>

Indeed, one reason this year's death numbers are not higher is that the Supreme Court announced in early May it would hear a case, <I>Felker v. Turpin</I>, challenging the new <I>habeas</I> law. The case was decided in late June, with the law essentially being upheld. But during that two-month period from May to June, virtually no one was executed.<P>

Many suspect the Supreme Court will soon agree to hear <I>Lindh v. Murphy</I>, decided recently by the Chicago-based Seventh Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, which declared that the new law applies retroactively, to cases already in the pipeline when it was enacted. The ruling also interprets the law as requiring federal judges to give greater deference to state court decisions -- a requirement some say guts the <I>habeas</I> process.<P>

Hatch says he does not expect the new law will lead to a flood of executions. "The new federal <I>habeas corpus</I> law has not created a rush to execute death row inmates, nor will it," the senator says. "The process will still be thorough and deliberate."<P>

LOST RESOURCES<BR>
If the punch of the new <I>habeas</I> law is not yet being fully felt, the elimination of the death penalty resource centers is having a starker effect. These 20 federal law offices, with their 190 lawyers, were defunded by Congress on April 1.<P>

Aside from providing lawyering, the offices kept track of who among the condemned had attorneys, injecting some order into the previously chaotic capital punishment system. Now, say death row advocates, that chaos is returning with a vengeance -- at a time when the intricate new <I>habeas</I> law makes it all the more crucial to have knowledgeable attorneys.<P>

"Now when you have people with the greatest need for legal assistance, you have no lawyers," says Stephen Bright, director of the Southern Center for Human Rights, which represents death row inmates. "It's like Congress passing a huge communications bill and then telling the communications industry, 'You can't have any lawyers to figure out what it means.'"<P>

For example: The Missouri resource center had eight lawyers and three investigators. When it shut down, O'Brien formed the Public Interest Litigation Clinic with private funds -- but it has just three lawyers and one investigator. Its mission: to watch over Missouri's 94 death row inmates.<P>

"I don't think anyone in Missouri got executed while there was a resource center, without us at least looking at the case," says O'Brien. "About half the time, we succeeded in convincing a federal court that the execution was unjust and should not go forward. In the last year, that ratio has been shot to hell."<P>

But critics of the resource centers say they were little more than taxpayer-funded think tanks for the anti-death penalty movement.<P>

"A lot of what they did was duplicative of work that already was being done by other defense counsel," insists Kamenar of the Washington Legal Foundation. "They would just come in as a third or fourth or fifth counsel on the case and not really add anything to it."<P>

Rep. Bob Inglis, R-S.C., who spearheaded the effort to kill the resource centers, agrees. "I am quite certain that the accused are continuing to get effective representation," he says.<P>

TEXAS LAW CHALLENGED<BR>
But many states seem to be having a tough time handling the death penalty smoothly.<P>

Exhibit A: Texas. The state last year passed a law requiring death row inmates to file their direct appeal at the same time as their state <I>habeas</I> appeal, and to do it within 180 days of conviction. In exchange for this streamlined appeal, the state guaranteed defendants appellate lawyers.<P>

That Texas law is now tied up in state court. Meanwhile, virtually no one is being executed in the state.<P>

At the same time, Texas is trying desperately to find lawyers for its 400-plus death row inmates, as its new statute promises. The state's Court of Criminal Appeals recently ordered 48 attorneys to take on death cases -- prompting a mini -rebellion among members of the defense bar. The court chose the lawyers so carelessly that it even named a prosecutor to represent one defendant -- a move it of course had to reverse.<P>

The upshot: Texas' death system, usually the most prolific in the nation, is paralyzed.<P>

Even Hatch acknowledges that defense lawyers in death cases need help. He wants to establish a national training center for lawyers who represent capital defendants.<P>

"I think it benefits everyone if we could get rid of these post-trial motions that say that defense lawyers are incompetent," Hatch says.<P>

So 20 years after the death penalty was re-established by the high court in <I>Gregg v. Georgia</I>, key steps were taken this year in an attempt to make it work better. Some think the death penalty is about to work well at last. But others see it plummeting toward disaster.<P>

About the only thing everyone agrees on, as Bryan Stevenson of Alabama's Equal Justice Initiative points out, is that the death penalty's first 20 years have been a mess. Conservatives are furious that murderers keep delaying their punishment; liberals are upset that, as they see it, the death penalty kills randomly and unfairly.<P>

"There are very few people in this country who would disagree that the whole death penalty experiment has been a failure," says Stevenson, whose group represents death row inmates. "They might disagree as to why, but most folks who have any information or experience would agree it's been a failure."<P>

<H2>Gun Ban Snares Cops</H2><P>

By Paul Elias<BR>
<I>The Recorder</I><BR>
Dec. 20, 1996<P>

A tough new federal law that bars anyone convicted of misdemeanor spousal abuse from owning or carrying a gun is creating chaos in police and sheriff's departments across the country.<P>

The measure, which amended the Gun Control Act of 1968 to take a hard line against domestic violence, makes no exceptions for law enforcement officials and other government employees whose job requires them to carry a weapon.<P>

Police officers and their union representatives blast the law as unconstitutional, threatening litigation if the gun ban costs officers their jobs. At the same time, law enforcement officials and police agencies are trying to figure out how to comply.<P>

"We are getting 200 to 300 calls a day," said Larry Washington, a special agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.<P>

In Dallas the police chief demoted an officer to a nonuniformed jail post, and in Minneapolis the chief demoted or suspended five officers with domestic violence rap sheets.<P>

In California, where some 100 peace officers could be affected, law enforcement officials are hoping to get some guidance from Attorney General Dan Lungren.<P>

Lungren is expected to issue an interpretation of the law in the next few days.<P>

The measure, which took effect Nov. 1, plugs a hole in federal gun control laws that already bar felons from owning firearms. Most domestic violence cases are prosecuted as misdemeanors.<P>

When the legislation was debated in Congress last year, there were few objections to the argument that domestic violence offenders should be barred from owning guns. In fact, California already has a law on the books that says anyone convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence can't own a gun for 10 years, but it gives discretion to waive the prohibition for peace officers.<P>

But what is driving law enforcement officials craziest about the federal ban is a phrase that apparently makes it retroactive. Federal officials say anyone convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence at any time permanently loses the right to carry a gun.<P>

In other words, the law can be applied even if a cop was convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence 20 years ago. The prohibition extends to the military, the National Guard and any other government agency where employees carry arms.<P>

ATF chief John Magaw, in a Nov. 27 letter to every police chief and sheriff in the country, said the ban "applies to persons convicted of such misdemeanors at any time, even if the conviction occurred prior to the new law's effective date."<P>

Internally, ATF is asking any of its officers with misdemeanor domestic violence records to come forward on their own.<P>

Despite Magaw's letter, many officials are still unsure of how to deal with the law and find themselves in a legal wringer.<P>

On the one hand, government lawyers warn that departments may face increased liability if they fail to identify officers with domestic violence records and remove their weapons.<P>

On the other hand, police unions -- at least in the Bay Area -- are threatening to sue the first department that fires a peace officer because of the federal law.<P>

"Nobody condones domestic violence, but this smacks of <I>ex post facto</I>," said Ed Lieberman, a union representative with the Operating Engineers Local 3, which represents more than 3,000 Bay Area peace officers, including 600 San Francisco sheriff's deputies.<P>

But the <I>ex post facto</I> argument is a long shot, some officials said.<P>

"That is on firm legal standing," said Ken Jaques, a spokesman for Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-New Jersey, who first introduced the measure baring misdemeanor spousal abusers from owning guns. "The courts have time and again upheld" similar laws.<P>

DEMOTIONS PLANNED IN L.A.<BR>
So far, at least three Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies have been stripped of their weapons and given 90 days to accept a demotion to a civilian job or get fired, but no Bay Area peace officer has lost his job or had his gun taken away as a result of the law.<P>

A spokeswoman for San Francisco Sheriff Michael Hennessey said the department is reviewing personnel files and has yet to uncover any deputies with domestic violence convictions.<P>

And the S.F. Police Department intends to review the personnel files of its nearly 2,100 officers.<P>

"It looks like we have to comply," said Lt. James Dudley.<P>

Meanwhile, departments are looking to Lungren for guidance on how to proceed.<P>

Deputy Attorney General Paul Bishop, Lungren's point man on gun issues, said his boss has not yet made up his mind on how to advise law enforcement officials.<P>

Police unions are lobbying for a fight with the federal government, but Bishop said Lungren has no plans to challenge the measure in court.<P>

Bishop said Lungren is caught in a political wringer of his own: If Lungren interprets the law narrowly, to include only the most violent of misdemeanors, he risks incurring the wrath of crime victims groups. But if the AG gives it a broad reading to include every domestic violence conviction, he will upset the police.<P>

Said Bishop: "He's in a horrible position."<P>

<H2>Why Can't the Condemned Die Without a Fuss?</H2>

By Ann Woolner<BR>
<I>Fulton County Daily Report</I><BR>
Dec. 23,1996<P>

Attorney General Michael J. Bowers gets a lot of press complaining that the state's most despicable criminals -- those sentenced to die -- are constantly monkeying with the courts to delay justice.<P>

No question that, for most condemned prisoners, the idea is to stay alive as long as possible, and that means manipulating the system to do so.<P>

But what really clogs up the works is when, long after the conviction, long after sentencing, years after the convicted man has been locked into death row and the horror over the original crime has subsided, some judge or panel of judges decides that the guy's trial was unfair in the first place.<P>

Sometimes it happens because of evolving interpretations of death penalty law. But generally it takes a lot to get a conviction set aside -- cooked evidence, racially rigged jury pools, a lawyer literally asleep at the defense table. Yet, depending on whose statistics you use, nearly half to two- thirds of the people Georgia juries have sentenced to die under the modern death penalty law have persuaded one court or another that their trials were so unfair that their sentences or their convictions should be set aside.<P>

But they don't do it without lawyers with time and knowledge and dedication to sift through the court record, the law, the evidence. If anyone knows that, Michael Bowers does.<P>

Fortunately, so does U.S. District Court Judge Willis B. Hunt Jr. Until Hunt put a stop to it, Bowers -- as well as a slim majority of the Georgia Supreme Court -- had been perfectly willing to let Marcus A. Wellons go to his death on Dec. 12 begging for someone to please give him a lawyer, while volunteer lawyers pleaded for the chance to take his case. Indeed, Wellons came within three hours of execution without a lawyer, without even entering -- much less exhausting -- the habeas corpus process the law says he's allowed.<P>

Lawyers for the state say Wellons and the lawyers at Long, Weinberg, Ansley & Wheeler, who had informally agreed to represent him, were merely trying to snake their way around a new state Supreme Court rule that seeks to streamline the habeas process by setting certain deadlines. But in this, the first time Rule 44 has had a workout, the Wellons case shows what's wrong with the rule.<P>

What's wrong is that it assumes the state has enough death penalty appellate lawyers to monitor death row and to work up cases so that they can be prepared to take over from the lawyer handling the inmate's direct appeal and file a state habeas petition the moment the U.S. Supreme Court acts (or decides against acting) on the direct appeal. But last year's federal de-funding of centers set up to handle these appeals (including the now stripped-down Georgia Resource Center), the scarcity of death penalty experts paid by private donations and the dearth of volunteer lawyers has left several Georgians on death row without representation.<P>

Wellons, convicted in the rape and murder of a 15-year-old girl, had barely gotten through the first, automatic round of appeals with a denial of cert from the U.S. Supreme Court on Oct. 7 when two things happened almost simultaneously. Long, Weinberg lawyers, answering a plea from Chief Justice Robert Benham to take a death penalty appeals case pro bono, had just received Wellons' case file on Friday, Nov. 29. That Monday, Dec. 2, Cobb Superior Court Judge Mary E. Staley granted District Attorney Thomas J. Charron's request to order Wellons' execution. She said Wellons should be put to death between Dec. 12 and Dec. 19. Wellons v. Turpin, No. 1:96-cv- 3322 (N.D.Ga. filed Dec. 20, 1995).<P>

With Charron and Staley moving with more speed than is usual in these matters, state officials were caught off guard but hurried to prepare the chair and the condemned for a Dec. 12 execution.<P>

Long, Weinberg lawyers went straight to the Georgia Supreme Court, seeking a stay of execution so they would have time to prepare a habeas petition. Four justices said no, pointing out that the lawyers had skipped a step or two in coming straight to the Supreme Court.<P>

The dissenting justices, Benham, Norman S. Fletcher and Leah J. Sears, said, "Although the Georgia Constitution guarantees the right to seek habeas relief, the complexities of death penalty cases render this right meaningless without competent counsel." Written by Fletcher, the dissenting opinion said the case should be remanded to the appropriate habeas court.<P>

It wasn't, since that was, after all, only a minority opinion. But Wellons and Long, Weinberg lawyers went to federal court and persuaded Hunt to halt the execution until he could hold a hearing on the matter. After the hearing, Hunt issued a 10-month stay and appointed Long, Weinberg counsel for a federal habeas petition -- but only on grounds already exhausted through direct state appeal. This also gives the lawyers time to deal with the state habeas petition on any new grounds they may find.<P>

As the Supreme Court dissenters pointed out, part of the problem is that while the law allows state habeas petitions, no law says the condemned has a right to court-appointed counsel for that phase. Georgia and Mississippi are the only states that do not provide funding for counsel at this stage. Only for trial, direct appeal and the later federal habeas case can the condemned have appointed lawyers.<P>

But what good is a state habeas proceeding without a lawyer?<P>

Not much, which is why Benham is asking for volunteers. And yet, there just are not enough volunteer lawyers to go around, even with the help of the government-funded experts and the Georgia Resource Center.<P>

Things have reached such a pitch in Georgia that we do not have to imagine what it would be like for a death-sentenced convict to show up at a habeas corpus hearing without counsel. We have a transcript.<P>

"Mr. Gibson, do you want to proceed?" Augusta Circuit Superior Court Judge J. Carlisle Overstreet asked the condemned man, Exzavious Gibson, in September at a state habeas corpus hearing held at the state prison at Jackson, which houses death row.<P>

"I don't have an attorney," Gibson replied.<P>

"I understand that."<P>

"I am not waiving any rights," Gibson said.<P>

"I understand that. Do you have any evidence you want to put up?" the judge asked.<P>

"I don't know what to plead," Gibson said.<P>

Overstreet had explained nothing to Gibson about the hearing, except that it was a civil proceeding and that he had a right to counsel, but not to a free one. The judge had also established, by asking the state's lawyer, that Gibson had the burden of proof because he had filed a petition claiming his trial lawyer had been ineffective. But Overstreet did not explain what the burden of proof meant, and he did not tell him this was an evidentiary hearing on the ineffective- assistance claim, or that any issue Gibson failed to raise now would be lost to him forever. Gibson v. Turpin, No. 95-v-648 (Butts Super. filed Dec. 20, 1995).<P>

When Gibson said he did not know how to plead, Overstreet said, "I am not asking you to plead to anything. ... I am just asking you if you have anything you want to introduce to this court."<P>

"But I don't have an attorney."<P>

"Yes, sir. Do you have anything you want to tell this court?"<P>

"I don't waive my rights."<P>

At that point, M. Elizabeth Wells, one of two lawyers left at the Georgia Resource Center, which represents death row inmates and seeks volunteer lawyers for others, stood to introduce herself as the lawyer who had filed motions as amicus curiae in the Gibson case.<P>

The Resource Center, in cases where it has not yet found volunteer counsel, has helped death row inmates file "pro se" habeas petitions while asking for friend of the court status. Wells' precise role in this case is unclear. She did not return a call from the Daily Report.<P>

At the Gibson habeas hearing, she asked to be heard.<P>

"No, ma'am, have a seat," Overstreet said. "Mr. Gibson, do you have anything you want to tell this court?"<P>

"I don't waive any rights."<P>

Addressing the lawyer again, the judge told Wells he had ruled on all her motions. She said she had not seen all the rulings and that the state's lawyer had. Then the judge turned again to Gibson.<P>

"Mr. Gibson, I will be glad to listen to anything you want to tell me, anything you want to say. I judge you have nothing you want to say or nothing you want to tell me. Is that correct? Except what is in your petition."<P>

"I don't have an attorney."<P>

"I know that. I can see that. Does the state want to tell me anything?"<P>

Assistant Attorney General Paige Reese Whitaker told the judge that Gibson had no right to counsel in a state habeas corpus proceeding. She cited case law and noted that the resource center had, in fact, filed motions on Gibson's behalf, if not in his name.<P>

"It is the state's position," Whitaker concluded, "that this is most likely a ploy for an appeal from this habeas corpus proceeding, as the pleadings so far filed by the Resource Center as amicus counsel have threatened that type of an appeal ... ."<P>

Later, Whitaker elaborated in an interview, saying that the Resource Center "chose to make him pro se and make it a test case."<P>

At the hearing, Wells said that simply was not true. Next came a lengthy and remarkably nasty exchange between the judge and Wells. He told her to get into the case or get out of it. She insisted the Resource Center had too large a caseload. He said that maybe if she hadn't taken a two-week European vacation she might have had time to help Gibson. She cited 14-hour workdays and work-filled weekends.<P>

She said she would represent Gibson if the judge gave her enough time to get up to speed. He said she had had plenty of time and that he wouldn't make deals.<P>

She told him he was making a "mockery of the system." He said that, based on what she had filed so far, "I am not so sure you are ... capable of representing him ... ."<P>

"Your Honor, I'm going to try to make you see that this is--that nobody has ever proceeded in a modern death penalty [proceeding] in Georgia without counsel," an exasperated Wells said at one point.<P>

"I understand that," said Overstreet.<P>

The judge invited Wells to represent Gibson, to "come up here and help him."<P>

"Help him what? Help this court deny him all his rights?" she said.<P>

Overstreet told Wells, "All you have done is sit outside the bar and throw stones."<P>

"Your honor--"<P>

"Get inside the bar and do something."<P>

She again asked the judge first to discuss scheduling the case before she agreed, but Overstreet refused.<P>

"Mr. Gibson may as well be hung up from a tree out back," Wells said.<P>

Finally, Overstreet told Wells to be seated and the state's lawyer to proceed. It was the state's turn because Gibson, whose IQ is in the 80s, had offered no evidence to back his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. He had given no indication that he knows he is supposed to do so.<P>

The state's first and only witness was Gibson's trial attorney, W. Dennis Mullis of Cochran, who represented Gibson as public defender.<P>

Under questioning from Whitaker, Mullis described the rather considerable evidence the state presented at trial when Gibson was convicted of killing an Eastman, Ga., convenience store operator in a robbery, stabbing him so often and so hard that the knife broke off inside the man's body. There was evidence that Gibson, who already had a violent record, robbed the store because of his crack habit. He was 17 at the time of the murder.<P>

Even in this one-sided hearing, it emerged that Gibson's own mother had been murdered, that his father had been absent from his life and the aunt who raised him had abused him, though the degree of abuse was unclear. Mullis presented evidence of Gibson's youth and his troubled childhood during the sentencing phase of the trial to try to dissuade the jury from a sentence of death. To no avail.<P>

Without opposing counsel at the habeas hearing to present evidence, to object, to cross- examine, it's impossible to know whether there is anything in the Gibson case that might have made the difference between life and death. Overstreet hasn't yet ruled in the habeas matter, but certainly from Mullis' direct testimony, he seems to have done a capable job in pursuing various avenues of defense. But then, who knows?<P>

Asked whether he wanted to cross-examine Mullis, Gibson said, "I don't have any counsel."<P>

"I understand that, but I am just asking, can you tell me yes or no whether you want to ask him any questions or not?"<P>

"I'm not my own counsel."<P>

And so, the only witness in the hearing, Mullis, was excused from the witness stand.<P>

At that point, Whitaker said she'd like to ask Gibson the circumstances behind his filing the habeas petition. This brought Wells to her feet. She said such questioning was improper.<P>

"Ms. Wells, Ms. Wells, Ms. Wells," the judge said. "I have warned you once. You stand up again and interrupt these proceedings and I'm going to ask them to escort you out. Do you understand that?"<P>

"[B]ut I cannot sit back and watch this happen--"<P>

"Officer, would you please escort her out of here, please?"<P>

"Mr. Gibson cannot be expected to know what to do in this situation," Wells protested. "He has no attorney."<P>

"Ma'am. Ma'am," the judge said. "You are not helping this man one bit. Please leave."<P>

"Your honor, he has no way of knowing-- "<P>

The judge called a recess and again told an officer to escort Wells out of the courtroom. When court resumed, Whitaker asked Gibson whether he had had any dealings with the Resource Center about filing the habeas petition. Gibson said he did not remember.<P>

Just as Overstreet was about to adjourn, he asked the state's Whitaker whether she knew of "any other<P>

rights or advice we need to give Mr. Gibson ... ."<P>

"I think Mr. Gibson should be aware that this is his first habeas corpus proceeding," said Whitaker, "and that if he chooses to file another one, anything that he doesn't raise in this one is going to probably be found to be waived under Georgia law."<P>

And so it was.r<P>

<H2>California High Court to Weigh In on Public Access to Civil Trials</H2><P>

As the debate rages on over cameras in the courts, the California Supreme Court on Wednesday took up a broader proposition: whether all the media -- and the public as well -- have a constitutional right to attend civil trials. <P>

The Second District Court of Appeal said there is such a First Amendment right, as have at least four federal courts. But the U.S. Supreme Court has never reached the issue -- in fact, the issue of public access to criminal trials badly splintered the court 16 years ago.<P>

The court also agreed Wednesday to try once again to bring some clarity to the statute of limitations in legal malpractice suits. It is the fourth such case the court has agreed to decide this decade.<P>

The courtroom access case, <I>NBC Subsidiary v. Superior Court (Locke)</I>, S056924, stems from a fraud suit against actor Clint Eastwood by his former companion, Sandra Locke. She alleges that he reneged on promises to help her develop motion picture projects, according to the Second District's opinion in the case. <P>

Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge David Schacter ruled that the press and public were welcome for all proceedings held before the jury. But everything else would be held behind closed doors, Schacter ordered, and transcripts of those proceedings would not be made available until after the trial. <P>

Schacter said in court that his paramount concern was a fair trial for the litigants. <P>

"This is the type of information that ends up in tabloids, that faces everybody that walks . . . into a grocery store . . .," Schacter said. "And to ensure that the jurors do not hear this even by accident . . . this is a very, very small intrusion on the First Amendment." <P>

The Second District reversed, relying on the U.S. Supreme Court's 1980 ruling in <I>Richmond Newspapers v. Virginia</I>, 448 U.S. 555. In that case a plurality concluded that because open trials were an essential component of English common law, the First Amendment encompassed such a right. <P>

Although <I>Richmond Newspapers</I> applied only to criminal trials, Second District Justice Paul Turner reasoned -- as have several federal judges before him -- that the same must be true of civil trials. <P>

The superior court in Los Angeles -- which has been an active litigant before the appellate courts recently -- petitioned for review. Frederick Bennett, Los Angeles assistant county counsel, pointed out that <I>Richmond Newspapers</I> was issued by a badly splintered court which expressly reserved the issue of civil trial openness. <P>

Courts construing <I>Richmond Newspapers</I> in the civil context frequently cite a statement from <I>Blackstone's Commentaries</I> that "one of the most conspicuous features of English justice is that all judicial trials are held in open court, to which the public have free access," Bennett noted. <P>

"However," Bennett continued, "Blackstone also noted that the civil law, as then modeled, rejected all public examination of witnesses. . . . For in Ecclesiastical Courts it was invariably the practice to examine the witnesses in secret and to only render the judgment in public." <P>

Bennett also pointed out that in criminal trials, the people, through the prosecution, are a party to the case. "Many civil cases on the other hand arise solely out of private disputes between parties that have resorted to the courts only because they were unable to resolve disputes privately," he argued. And while some civil suits, such as tobacco company litigation for example, may present issues of public importance, the Locke-Eastwood dispute does not, Bennett wrote. <P>

Kelli Sager, a Los Angeles partner at Seattle's Davis Wright Tremaine, representing a media coalition challenging the order, filed a perfunctory eight-page response relying principally on procedural reasons why the court should not grant review. On the merits, she noted simply that the Third, Sixth, Seventh and Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, as well as some federal district courts, have required that civil trials be open. <P>

"Indeed," Sager wrote, the L.A. Superior Court "has not cited a single case to support the proposition that civil proceedings should not be presumptively open under the First Amendment." <P>

All of the Supreme Court justices except for Stanley Mosk voted to grant review. <P>

BROBECK WINS MALPRACTICE REVIEW<BR>
The Supreme Court also decided Wednesday to wade back into the sticky wicket of legal malpractice statutes of limitations. And it will use two suits against Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison as its vehicle. <P>

Chief Justice Ronald George and Justices Joyce Kennard, Marvin Baxter, Kathryn Mickle Werdegar and Ming Chin voted to grant review in <I>Stone v. Davis</I>, S056567. The same five plus Justice Janice Rogers Brown voted to review <i>Jordache Enterprises v. Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison</i>, S056954. <P>

In <i>Jordache</I>, a blue jeans maker sued Brobeck for failing to advise the company that it had potential insurance coverage in a trade infringement action. In <I>Stone</I>, Brobeck was accused of acting negligently in handling the sale of an office building. In each case, Brobeck is appealing a ruling from the Second District Court of Appeal. <P>

Each case requires the high court to determine when the statute of limitations begins running in a legal malpractice action -- an issue that presents possibly the ugliest morass in California law right now. <P>

The Supreme Court decided four years ago in <I>Laird v. Blacker</I>, 2 Cal.4th 606 (1992), that the statute begins running when an action is dismissed due to an attorney's negligence -- not when all of the appeals from that dismissal are exhausted. <P>

The Supreme Court followed with two rulings over the next three years clarifying and creating exceptions to <I>Laird</I>. Then in November 1995, the court appeared to retreat from the <I>Laird</I> rule in <i>Adams v. Paul</I>, 11 Cal.4th 583. <P>

A splintered ruling issued after the court's 90-day deadline from oral argument, <I>Adams</I> seems to have hopelessly confused what was already a complicated issue.<P>

A sentence from Justice Ramona Godoy Perez's opinion for the Second District in <I>Stone</I> is illustrative: "Nothing in <i>Adams</i> states or even suggests that the <I>ITT</i> court's overruling of <i>Johnson</i> was also being overruled by <I>Adams</i>." <P>

Brobeck played up that confusion in its petitions for review, and invited Justice Chin, who joined the court earlier this year, to resolve it. "Despite this court's best effort to provide guidance in <i>Adams</i> last year, the situation has now degenerated to the point where even panels within the same appellate district openly disagree," Jeffrey Chanin of Keker & Van Nest wrote in the <I>Jordache</i> petition. <P>

"Justice Chin's court of appeal opinions in <I>Foxborough v. Van Atta</I>, 26 Cal.App.4th 217 (1994), and <I>Baltins v. James</I>, 36 Cal.App.4th 1193 (1995), make clear that the accrual question is one in which he has expressed an interest and has offered his own suggestions for harmonizing the relevant cases," Chanin added. <P>

<H2>Johnnie Cochran, Nancy Grace Join Court TV</H2>
<P>Court TV announced Nov. 12 that it will launch a live, weeknight talk show, "Cochran & Grace," beginning January 13. The one-hour program will be co-anchored by Atlanta prosecutor Nancy Grace, who specializes in cases involving violent crimes and has never lost a case, and Los Angeles trial and defense lawyer Johnnie L. Cochran, Jr., famed for his trailblazing victories in civil rights cases and work for celebrity clients including Michael Jackson, Reginald Denny and O.J. Simpson.</P>

<P>"Cochran & Grace" will air weeknights at 10:00pm ET and PT (repeated at 1:00am ET and 10:00pm PT) and will be executive-produced by Court TV Executive Vice President and Executive Producer Erik Sorenson. Cochran and Grace, along with high-profile guests, will analyze and debate not only the day's top legal stories, but also the wider social and political implications. The show, featuring viewer call-ins from across the country, will air live from Court TV's New York studios. </P>

<P>Both Cochran and Grace have signed three-year contracts with the network. Grace has resigned as Special Prosecutor of the Fulton County District Attorney's Office and will move to New York. Cochran is continuing to maintain his Los Angeles-based law practice, while dividing his time between New York and Los Angeles.</P>

<P>"In Nancy Grace and Johnnie Cochran we have two highly-regarded, extremely articulate -- indeed electric -- lawyers who have widely different views on most issues but who share an avid interest in the law and how the law is applied in this country and around the world," said Court TV Founder and CEO Steven Brill.</P>

<P>"Most of the shows will be topic and story-driven," said Executive Producer Erik Sorenson, "focusing on topics ranging from the Unabomber trial to the War Crimes Tribunal at The Hague; from race relations in America, to the death penalty, to the right-to-die controversy before the U.S. Supreme Court. Top newsmakers and the movers and shakers of public opinion will join Cochran and Grace every night to discuss the issues of the day."
</P> 
<P>Nancy Grace, born and raised in Macon, Georgia, served as Special Prosecutor on major felony cases for Atlanta's Fulton County District Attorney's Office beginning in 1992 and was Assistant District Attorney from 1987 to 1992.  </P>

<P>Prior to joining the District Attorney's office, Grace practiced civil law as an attorney with the Federal Trade Commission where she pursued complex antitrust violations and nationwide consumer protection cases, and was a judicial law clerk in Federal District Court.  Grace, who has compiled a perfect record of over 55 convictions and no losses, has handled several of Atlanta's most high-profile cases, specializing in serial murder, rape, and molestation. Her most noteworthy convictions include those of Atlanta millionaire Weldon Wayne Carr, convicted for the murder of his wife in a spousal abuse and arson case; David Lindsey Cook, convicted in the murder of his wife after making her death appear to be suicide; Walter Gates, convicted of serial child molestation; and serial rapist Anton Jermaine Smith, convicted of raping several women who then came forward and allowed their names and faces to be publicized. </P>

<P>Grace, who has served as a legal commentator for CNN, NBC Today, CNBC, and Court TV, also is a Litigation Instructor at Georgia State University School of Law and a Business Law Instructor at GSU's School of Business. Grace, a victim's rights advocate, was honored with the Council of Battered Women Award four times and remains a member of the Council on Battered Women Speakers Bureau. She received her undergraduate degree and law degree from Mercer University in Macon, Georgia and was a member of the law review.</P>

<P>Johnnie Cochran was designated one of four "Headliners for 1995" by Time magazine and is the only attorney in California history to be named Trial Lawyer of the Year by organizations representing both the state's civil and criminal attorneys. Cochran began his legal career as a prosecutor with the Los Angeles City Attorney's Office. </P>

<P>After leaving the office, Cochran founded the firm Cochran, Atkins & Evans and, over the next 11 years, established himself as one of the city's leading criminal defense lawyers. In 1978, Cochran returned to public service, when he was appointed Assistant District Attorney of Los Angeles County, making him the first African-American lawyer to hold this position in the country's largest prosecutorial agency. </P>

<P>During his three-year tenure with the office, Cochran spearheaded a reform of the DA's system for handling sexual assault and domestic violence cases. In 1979, he served as founding chairman of Los Angeles County's Domestic Violence Council. Three years later, Cochran returned to private practice as a defense attorney and won a number of landmark decisions in civil rights cases involving police misconduct. In 1992, Cochran won the largest verdict ever against the city of Los Angeles in a police misconduct matter on behalf of a 13-year-old girl molested by a police officer. Cochran has represented such high-profile clients as actor Todd Bridges, former Black Panther Geronimo Pratt, Reginald Denny and O.J. Simpson. </P>

<P>Cochran was named the 1995 "Lawyer of the Year" by The National Law Journal, the first African-American to be so honored. Cochran was recently inducted into the "Inner Circle of Advocates," an exclusive organization limited to 100 of the country's best trial lawyers. Cochran, who was born in Shreveport, Louisiana and educated at Los Angeles High School, UCLA and Loyola Law School, is the author of a personal and professional autobiography, "Journey to Justice," which has been a fixture on the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Los Angeles Times, and Washington Post bestseller lists since its publication by One World/Ballantine Books in October.</P>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions About Court TV</h2>

<H4>When did Court TV start?</H4>

<P>Court TV was launched on July 1, 1991.</P>

<H4>Who owns Court TV?</H4>

<P>Court TV is owned by American Lawyer Media, Liberty Media, NBC and Time Warner.</P>

<H4>What was the first trial on Court TV?</H4>

<P>The first trial was <I>Florida v. Robert Scott Hill.</i>  He was acquitted of charges of murdering his stepmother-in-law more than 20 years earlier.</P>

<H4>How do you select the cases that are covered on Court TV?</H4>

<P>Several factors are considered  when deciding whether to air a trial. They include: how important and interesting the issues in the case are; the newsworthiness of the case and the people involved; the quality and educational value of the trial, and the expected length of the trial.</P>

<H4>Are all of the Court TV anchors also lawyers?</H4>

<P>The on-air anchors are all lawyers with the exception of Terry Moran. He is a journalist who previously worked at <I>Legal Times,</i> a Washington-based affiliate publication of Court TV.</P>

<H4>Will Court TV be closed-captioned?</H4>

<P>Closed captioning is an area that we've recently started exploring. It is something we would like to eventually do but there are tremendous technical obstacles that have to be overcome.</P>

<H4>If Court TV is live, why is there a delay in the broadcast?</H4>

<P>Court TV uses a 10-second delay. This is the policy for all trials. The reason for the delay is to prevent the airing of  information such as the addresses of witnesses, the names of jurors, private conversations between a lawyer and his/her client.</P>

<H4>Are cameras allowed in all courtrooms?</H4>

<P>Most states allow cameras in the courtroom. The exceptions are South Dakota, Indiana and Mississippi.</P>

<P>Most state laws leave it up to the trial judge to decide whether he/she will allow a camera in the courtroom.</P>

<P>The federal courts do not allow cameras. An experiment that allowed cameras in certain federal courts ended and the Judicial Commission, which establishes policy for federal courts, voted not to renew the experiment.</P>

<P>Court TV is working to get the commission to reconsider its ruling.</P>

violations to disorderly conduct to consumer disputes, the cases

"Instant Justice" is the real People's Court, the real Night Court.  It's an
entertaining glimpse at "bare bones" justice in America today.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="/graphics/ctv/programs/dcwatch.gif">
<BLOCKQUOTE>Court TV's "Washington Watch" is devoted to lively 
discussion about legal news and judicial issues taking place in 
the nation's capital.  This weekly program is hosted by Fred 
Graham, Court TV's chief anchor, who covered the Washington 
political scene and the Supreme Court for CBS News and The New 
York Times.  Expert guests have included U.S. Attorney General 
Janet Reno, former Attorney General Ed Meese and White House 
Counsel Abner Mikva.  Topics have ranged from an analysis of 
President Clinton's crime bill, to the changing face of the U.S. 
Supreme Court, to the state of civil rights issues in the 
Clinton Administration.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="/graphics/ctv/programs/verdicts.gif">
<BLOCKQUOTE>"Verdicts and Justice" is designed for viewers who 
have missed important court decisions and are curious about what 
has happened to the fascinating people whose stories were 
revealed in Court TV trials.  From a look back at the 
extraordinary moments when defendants and other trial 
participants hear the verdict, to reports on the current status 
of those involved in the case, "Verdicts and Justice" gives 
viewers the opportunity to determine the soundness of the 
verdict and learn if justice was served.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><BR></P>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="/graphics/ctv/programs/tstory.gif">
<BLOCKQUOTE>"Trial Story" takes the most important moments from a trial covered on Court
TV and condenses them into a one-hour or two-hour prime time program.  From
opening statements to the verdict, Trial Story features all a trial's key
testimony as well as interviews with judges, attorneys, defendants and
plaintiffs.  Some recent "Trial Story" programs include the case of Claire
and Anthony Maglica, a couple whose multi-million dollar business
relationship dissolved along with their 20-year romance, and Dr. Jack
Kevorkian who, in violation of Michigan law, helped terminally ill people
commit suicide.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><BR></P>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="/graphics/ctv/programs/system.gif">
<BLOCKQUOTE>Court TV's weekly series "The System" takes viewers on a journey through our
complex, confusing and often misunderstood judicial system.  Set in the
diverse New York City community of Far Rockaway, Queens, "The System" follows
real cases and real characters as they make their way from the street to the
police precinct to the courthouse.  It's the ultimate lesson on how the
judicial process works, outlining legal failures and successes through the
lives of those who are players in the system.</BLOCKQUOTE>

highlights.  "Prime Time Justice" is the perfect program for working people

<H2>Your Turn</H2>



<H3>Teen Curfew:  Necessary or Unconstitutional?</H3>



<P>Okay, you've accepted the fact that your parents tell you when to come home, but now you have to listen to politicians? Shouldn't teenagers have the same rights as everyone else? What's the point of learning about the Constitution in class if it doesn't apply to you? Yet another source of torment for the already angst-ridden teenage years. </P>



<P>This week we will go to San Diego to discuss teen curfews.  We'll discuss whether curfew laws violate the constitutional rights of teenagers.  We'll also think about whether cities can legally use curfew laws to keep teens off the streets as a way to cut down on crime.</P>



<P>In 1994, the San Diego City Council adopted a proposal for stricter enforcement of the city's existing juvenile curfew ordinance.  San Diego has had a juvenile curfew ordinance since the 1940s, but it was rarely enforced.  The new curfew bars teens from hanging-out after 10 p.m. If you get caught and your parents don't come for you, you'll be stuck at the police station until the sun comes up. The exceptions to the rule are if a teen is with a parent or guardian, on an emergency errand for a parent, returning from a school sponsored activity, or from a job.</P>



<P>Case in point: Asha Settimo was out on a date, with her mom's permission, when she was picked up by the San Diego police.  Asha spent two hours at the police station before being released.</P>



<P>Asha thought this law was so unfair that she joined other teenagers in a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union. The ACLU argues that the benefit of any small reduction in crime is far outweighed by claims that the curfew violates minors' first and fourteenth amendment rights and works as an unconstitutional mandate of guilt by association.</P>



<P>David Pressman, a 19-year old college student and one of the teenagers joined in the lawsuit, says that the curfew forces law-abiding teenagers to consider breaking the law even if they are going to a study group or a production of Hamlet. He also argues that crime during curfew hours has decreased at the same rate as non-curfew hours.  </P>



<P>Others think a curfew is worthwhile if it prevents teens from getting killed and lowers the crime rate. Mayor Susan Golding credits teen curfews for the 20 percent drop in violent juvenile crime in San Diego from 1992 to 1995.  In addition, she says that the number of juvenile victims of violent crimes has dropped 25 percent, and the number of juvenile victims of violent crimes during curfew hours has dropped 40 percent from 1993 to 1995.</P>



<P>While an appellate court in California decides whether the night time curfew law is constitutional, San Diego is cranking up the heat by adopting a daytime curfew which fines students up to $250 for skipping school for their first offense and requires them to perform community service. </P>

<B><FONT SIZE="+1"><P><a name="free">Simpson, A Free Man, Comes And Goes As He Pleases</a></FONT></B><BR>
SANTA MONICA, Calif. -- Perhaps the most striking difference between O.J. Simpson's
criminal trial and the civil trial is that Simpson is now a free man. During breaks
in the proceedings, Simpson walks out into the hallway with everybody else. He shakes
hands with his fans, chats with his mother and lawyers, and chats up the throngs of
reporters.</P>

<P>Each day Simpson arrives at the courthouse in a large, black Chevrolet sports utility
vehicle with tinted windows, driven by his bodyguard. Waiting to greet him are about
30 television cameras, lined up behind barricades. Several supporters and several
protesters are usually waiting as well. The car pulls up to a side entrance, not used
by the public, and Simpson gets out and is walked by the bodyguard to the door. The
bodyguard then returns and parks the car.</P>

<P>Leaving court each day Simpson walks with his bodyguard to the parked car. Because it is parked behind the press barricades, the camera crews surround Simpson and follow
him until his door slams and the Blazer drives away. He rarely says anything.</P>

<P>Toward the end of last week, Simpson began leaving the courthouse from a different
door, apparently trying to slip past the media throng. The first day, the camera crews
were forced to run across the long parking lot as Simpson easily slipped into his car
and sped away. The next day, the camera crews got smart and simply waited by Simpson's
car.</P>

<B><FONT SIZE="+1"><P><a name="tight">A Tight Squeeze In Fujisaki's Courtroom</a>
</FONT></B><BR>
SANTA MONICA, Calif. -- About the only people who have space inside Judge Hiroshi
Fujisaki's courtroom are the spectators -- and they don't have much. About 80 seats
are available, 40 reserved for the press and 40 for the public. The seats are like
movie theater chairs, not traditional courtroom benches. Spectators are required to
pass through a metal detector when they enter the courthouse, and then through a
second one before going inside the courtroom.</P>

<P>Inside the well of the courtroom, four groups of lawyers, the jury, and the alternate
jurors are crammed together. Simpson sits in the well next to one of his attorneys.
Ron Goldman's father, Frederic , and sister, Kim, sit in the front row of the
spectator seats.</P>

<P>Ron's mother Sharon Rufo, Lou and Juditha Brown, Nicole Brown Simpson's parents, and
Nicole's sister Denise have also attended recent court sessions. Simpson's mother
Eunice, who is in a wheelchair, has been a regular spectator.</P>

<P><a name="advocate"><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Goldman Becomes Judicial Reform Advocate</B></FONT></a><BR>
SANTA MONICA, Calif. -- Fredric Goldman, father of Ronald Goldman, was a familiar
face at the O.J. Simpson criminal trial. After Simpson was acquitted, Goldman said the
justice system failed him and filed a wrongful death suit against Simpson. Now, he's 
becoming a full-time, paid advocate for the victims rights' movement. Earlier this
month, Goldman joined Washington, D.C.-based Safe Streets, as a national spokesman and
director of public affairs. Goldman is opening the Los Angeles office for the
120,000-member group, which lobbies for judicial reform and victims' rights
legislation at the federal and state level. He has given up a 30-year career as a
salesman for this job, and will be paid $100,000 yearly salary at Safe Streets. "He has been a living example of what is wrong with the
criminal justice system," says Mark Gilman, the group's director of communications.
"We felt that he was the best spokesman available in the country to testify to the
problems existing within the  judicial process." </P>

<P>Although Goldman is currently on the payroll as a full-time employee, the group is
giving him time off to attend the O.J. Simpson civil trial. </P>


<FONT SIZE="+1"><P><a name="fiber"><B>Questioning A Police Officer's Fiber</B></a><BR></FONT>
SANTA MONICA, Calif. -- While LAPD Officer Robert Riske was defending his work on the
investigation of the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman, he also let
on that he is not one to follow all police protocol.</P>

<P>In his testimony Monday, Riske told the jury he does not carry the standard issue
flashlight. While testifying about how he found Nicole Brown Simpson's and Ronald
Goldman's bodies shortly after midnight on June 13, 1994, Riske pointed out that his
flashlight was metal and "much stronger" than the police-issued plastic model.
However, Riske said, he had to pay for it himself.</P>

<P>On cross-examination, Riske was questioned by defense attorney Robert Blaiser about
his dark blue uniform. Is it 100 percent wool, Blaiser asked.</P>

<P>"You can buy them polyester, but I don't do it," Riske said as a number of spectators
laughed.</P>

To Blaiser, however, it was no laughing matter. He was trying to show the jury that
blue-black fibers found at the Bundy crime scene and at O.J. Simpson's home, could
have come from a police uniform. In the criminal trial prosecutors contended the
fibers came from Simpson's dark colored sweatsuit.

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><a name="typo"><B>An Unfortunate Typo</B></a></FONT><BR>
SANTA MONICA, Calif. -- Was it a Freudian slip of the fingers?</P>

<P>As O.J. Simpson defense attorney Robert Baker gave his opening statements to the jury, he recounted the now-familiar tale of Simpson on the night of the murders knocking on Kato Kaelin's door to get some change. Simpson, on his way to Chicago, needed to break a hundred-dollar bill  to grab a snack at McDonald's and tip the sky cap at the airport. Unable to make change, Kato offered Simpson a twenty.</P>

<P>That's an old story from the criminal trial.</P>

<P>But take a closer look at the court reporters' transcript in the civil trial on Oct. 24, and the story seems to have changed -- and grew. On page 49, the original version of the official transcript plainly says Simpson asked to borrow the money for "a ski cap," not a sky cap.</P>

<P>Baker is quoted as saying, "When he [Simpson] asked him [Kaelin] about changing the $100, O.J. said, I need it because I've got -- I want to go get a burger and I need a couple of bucks for the ski cap."</P>

<P>Of course, the blue-black knit ski cap found at the crime scene was one of the central pieces of evidence in the criminal trial. Prosecutors said that hairs found in the cap matched Simpson's. In one of the most memorable moments of closing arguments, defense lawyer Johnny Cochran donned a similar knit cap to mock the prosecution's theory that Simpson used the cap as a disguise. </P>

<P>"If I put this knit cap on, who am I?" Cochran said.  "I'm still Johnnie Cochran with a knit cap. And if you looked at O.J. Simpson over there -- and he has a rather large head -- O.J. Simpson in a knit cap from two blocks away is still O.J. Simpson.  It's no disguise.  It's no disguise. It makes no sense.  It doesn't fit.  If it doesn't fit, you must acquit."</P>

<P>After being alerted to the discrepancy, the court reporter released a revised transcript. Alas, no new evidence. Baker said "sky cap."</P>

<FONT SIZE="+1"><a name="speak"><P><B>Lessons In Police Speak At $5 A Day</B><BR></a></FONT>
SANTA MONICA, Calif. -- The jury in the Simpson case certainly seems to be paying attention to the proceedings. Many take notes.</P>

<P>But a Nov. 1 note to Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki from an alternate juror shows at least some of the technical police-speak bandied about during testimony about blood evidence is not sinking in.</P>

<P>"Judge Fujisaki, I need clarification on the difference between transfer evidence and the other evidence mentioned. I am confused as to the conclusions drawn because I do not know the terminology," juror number 294 wrote. " I feel I need this terminology clarified before more blood evidence is discussed."</P>

<P>If figuring out the complexities of blood evidence isn't enough of a problem for the Simpson civil jury, now the judge has ordered them not to work on days when court is not in session.</P>

<P>The judge's ruling came after he heard from jurors that their co-workers were exerting pressure on them to talk about the case. Court was out of session on Oct. 30 because of a scheduling problem with witnesses, and a number of jurors returned to work for the day.</P>

<P>There was a little sweetener from the judge in his ruling, however. He ordered the jurors to get paid for jury service, even when court is dark -- a whopping $5 a day.</P>

<P>But it may not have solved all the jurors' problems. Five of them wrote Fujisaki a note last week asking to have his order in writing, so they could give it to their employers.</P>


<FONT SIZE="+1"><P><B><a name="antito">Judge Fujisaki, Not Quite The 'Anti-Ito'</B></a><BR></FONT>
SANTA MONICA, Calif. -- Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki has been portrayed in the media as the anti-Ito. And while he has kept the lawyers under control and the proceedings moving along, Fujisaki shares at least one trait with Lance Ito, the judge in the Simpson criminal trial. Neither starts court on time.</P>

<P>In the civil case, proceeding start at 8:30 a.m. Monday through Thursday, and on Fridays court begins at 9:00 a.m. But since opening statements began last week the Judge has never entered the courtroom at the designated time. Usually he is ten or fifteen minutes late. Breaks also run longer than the allotted five or ten minutes. Even after 90 minute lunch beak, court doesn't start on time.</P>

<P>Fujisaki is not a stickler for courtroom manners either. Spectators chew gum, read the newspaper, and audibly whisper without drawing even a look from the judge.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B><a name="ghoul">Trial Protester's Ghoulish Election Statement</B></FONT><BR></a>
SANTA MONICA, Calif. -- The one constant protester at Simpson's civil trial has been a man carrying a paper skeleton, which he uses to draw attention to a poster he carries lamenting the problem of judicial corruption. However, with Halloween several days past, the motif was beginning to lose its timeliness. But on Nov. 4, the protester fixed the problem. With the national elections the next day, he stuck a name tag on the skeleton. It reads: Bob Dole.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><a name="intern"><B>Intern Speaking To Simpson While Reporters Wait<BR></B></FONT></a>
SANTA MONICA, Calif. -- The USA Today story that alleges O.J. Simpson made inappropriate comments and sexual advances toward Santa Monica Superior Court intern Amber McGrath has created a frenzy among the media covering the civil trial.</P>

<P>McGrath told the newspaper that Simpson invited her to a Halloween party. Simpson has vehemently denied the 18-year-old intern's charges, telling reporters that he doesn't even know her.</P>

<P>I was waiting outside the courtroom on Oct. 31, trying to get a media pass from McGrath. One of her duties is to hand out passes to reporters. I told  her my name and waited with several other reporters. But she left her post and went down the hallway where Simpson was sitting by himself. She spent about the next ten minutes chatting with him.</P>

<P>The group of reporters waiting to get in the courtroom tried several times unsuccessfully to get McGrath's attention. Finally she heard our calls and returned to her post.</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1"><a name="toy">Don't Toy With This FBI Agent</FONT></B><BR></a>
SANTA MONICA, Calif. -- As members of the nation's most powerful law enforcement agency, FBI agents have a certain tough-guy image to uphold. After all, they make high-risk arrests, visit gruesome crime scenes -- and conduct hair and fiber analysis.</P>

<P>Douglas Deedrick, one of the bureau's hair and fiber experts who is testifying in the Simpson civil trial, made a point to let the courtroom know that although he spends many of his days inside a laboratory, he's been tough since childhood.</P>

<P>On the witness stand, Deedrick was describing rare carpet fibers from Simpson's Ford Bronco that were also discovered on the bloody glove allegedly found at Simpson's home and at the Bundy crime scene. One of the reasons the fibers are unique, Deedrick said, is because they are "tri-lobal." For the lay person, Deedrick also referred to them as having a "jack cross-section," because they look like one of the pieces of the children's game jacks. </P>

<P>But lest the spectators get the idea he was a wimp, Deedrick quickly explained how he came to make that reference.</P>

<P>"I never played with Jacks. The girls played with Jacks," he said. "I remember seeing them."</P>

<A name="schiller"><P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">Author Schiller Again The Center Of Controversy</FONT></B><BR>
</A>Larry Schiller, one of O.J. Simpson's confidants during the criminal trial and one of the authors of "An American Tragedy," may soon be appearing to testify in the civil trial. At issue is the audio tape purportedly made by Simpson shortly after the murders that Schiller played on ABC's 20/20 while promoting his book.</P>

<P>The plaintiffs argued in court that Simpson should be compelled to turn over the tape. However, the argument -- made outside the presence of the jury -- quickly grew nasty as the defense lawyers pointed out that the tape was in the hands of Schiller, not Simpson.</P>

<P>The plaintiffs claimed that Schiller most likely had a copy of the tape and that Simpson had the original.</P>

<P>"That is absolutely false and to make that assertion in open court is absolute misconduct," lead defense attorney Robert Baker said.</P>

<P>Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki agreed with the defense, noting: "you haven't satisfied me that the defendant has the tape . . . other than your say so, which is not sufficient."</P>

<P>But the plaintiffs lawyers, stung by the judge's dismissal, promised they would prove it -- by hauling Schiller into court.</P>

<P>"We're going to subpoena Schiller," said Daniel Petrocelli. "We're going to bring him in."</P>

<P>An angry Baker fired back. "You subpoena Schiller, beat your chest," he exclaimed, thumping his chest with both fists.</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1"><A name="kato">Simpson Comes To Kaelin's Defense</A></FONT></B><BR>
The now-famous houseguest Brian "Kato" Kaelin is scheduled to testify toward the end of this week. While his testimony will be familiar to observers of the criminal trial, he will be questioned by a new set of lawyers.</P>

<P>The plaintiffs, who are calling Kaelin to the stand, will use him to narrow down O.J. Simpson's whereabouts on the night of the murders. The defense, however, seems to believe that Kaelin is not the most credible witness -- at least if attorney Robert Baker remains true to comments he made during Simpson's deposition.</P>

<P>Baker gave his opinion about the houseguest during questioning that focused on Kaelin's discussion with Simpson, who was leaving for the airport, about noises behind the guest house.</P>

<P>"I was going in and out, to my Bronco and back, and he was talking about noises  . . .  and hearing something, earthquakes," Simpson said. "I mean, I really didn't pay much attention to what he was talking about."</P>

<P>Baker chimed in: "Most people don't."</P>

<P>Plaintiff's attorney Daniel Petrocelli tried to seize on Baker's characterization. "Well, off of your lawyer's comment, was Mr. Kaelin to your knowledge typically incoherent in your dealings with him?" Petrocelli asked.</P>

<P>Simpson defended his friend. "You guys seen Kato. Kato's Kato," Simpson said. "I found him to be Kato. Kato's very unique. I found him to be a very nice guy who is a little goofy, but I like him."</P>


<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1"><A name="lights">Lights On In The Simpson Household</B><BR></A></FONT>
The criminal trial testimony of limousine driver Allan Park, who is scheduled to take the stand this week in the civil trial, apparently made a lasting impression on O.J. Simpson.</P>

<P>Park testified that he arrived at Simpson's home at 10:25 p.m. -- 20 minutes early -- to pick up Simpson on the night of the murders. Nobody answered when Park buzzed the gate. Park noted that when he arrived, Simpson's house was dark except for one light upstairs. After frantically exchanging calls with his supervisor, Park saw somebody walk in the house. That person, Park said, was about Simpson's size. </P>

<P>What upset Simpson about Park's testimony, however, was the fact that he said no lights were on in the downstairs part of the house. Simpson claims that from Park's vantage point he could not have seen if the lights were on or off. So now, according to Simpson's deposition, whenever visitors come to Rockingham they are treated to a reenactment. They wait by the gate while Simpson goes inside and turns on the downstairs lights.</P>

<P>"I've done this with virtually everyone who's come into my house," Simpson told lead plaintiffs lawyer Daniel Petrocelli in his deposition.</P>

<P>"Why do you prove this fact to so many people who come to your house?" Petrocelli asked. "What's your purpose in doing it?"</P>

<P>Simpson replied that people ask him why no lights were on that night.</P>

<P>"Do you make a point of proving anything else to these people?" Petrocelli inquired further.</P>

<P>"Yes," Simpson noted. "That my housekeeper can cook and that my mom's a great cook and that I'm a good host."</P>


<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1"><A name="chippers">The Night Chippers</A></FONT></B><BR>
When Simpson takes the stand at the end of this week, one topic that is sure to come up is why was he chipping golf balls at 10:00 p.m. in his back yard on the night of the murders.</P>

<P>Lead plaintiffs attorney Daniel Petrocelli spent  a lot of time probing Simpson about his evening golfing habits during his deposition. Before June 12, 1994, Petrocelli asked, did Simpson hit golf balls in the yard after 10:00 p.m.</P>

<P>"It's something I do often. So I don't have any specific memory, but I know I would have because it's something that I do often," Simpson said. "I actually had a net that I put up on my garage and hit off a mat into my garage. As late as midnight I've done that."</P>

<P>In the time since his acquittal, Simpson's golfing habits haven't changed, except that he now has some golfing buddies who play with him on the lawn -- his lawyers Philip Baker, Robert Baker, and Robert Blasier.</P>

<P>"Did the lawyers also swing the clubs?" Petrocelli asked.</P>

<P>"Yes," replied Simpson.</P>

<P>Simpson also told Petrocelli that he has chipped golf balls in the yard at night three or four times since getting out of jail.</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1"><A name="closet">A Look Into A Celebrity's Closet</A></FONT></B><BR>
Former professional athletes apparently have more clothes than civil lawyers -- or at least more space to hang the latest fashions.</P>

<P>During his deposition, O.J. Simpson described how he was packing for his trip to Chicago on the night of the murders. At one point, Simpson said he opened his suitcase inside the closet.</P>

<P>The explanation seemed to confuse lead plaintiffs attorney Daniel Petrocelli.</P>

<P>"You can pack in your closet," Petrocelli asked. "Is that what you're saying?"</P>

<P>Helping out his client a bit, defense lawyer Bob Baker pointed out that "you can bowl in [Simpson's] closet."</P>

<P>Replied Petrocelli: "You have to understand, I have one of those little closets where it's about eight inches deep, you know."</P>

<P>It was too much for Baker not to follow up.</P>

<P>"But you're a mere mortal," he told Petrocelli.</P>

<H2>Robert Kardashian Faces Ethics Probe</H2>

<H3>Did Remarks About O.J. Breach Attorney-Client Privilege?</H3>

By Robert Schmidt <BR>
<I>Legal Times</I><BR>
October 21, 1996<P>

Robert Kardashian, friend and lawyer to O.J. Simpson, has alienated other members of the "dream team." He's strained relations with his old chum. He may have damaged the defense in Simpson's upcoming civil trial. <P>

But in sharing his doubts about Simpson's innocence on prime-time television, Kardashian may have also brought some serious ethics problems on himself. Last week, the California State Bar confirmed that it had launched an investigation into whether Kardashian has breached the attorney-client privilege in violation of state law. <P>

In a statement released last week, Judy Johnson, the chief trial counsel of the bar, said the probe is "at an early stage" and that there "has been no finding of wrongdoing." <P>

A state bar spokeswoman declines to say whether Kardashian's appearance earlier this month on ABC News' "20/20" program triggered the probe. <P>

Of course, Kardashian is not the first member of the dream team to go public with an inside account of Simpson's 1995 acquittal on murder charges. Nor is he the first to be investigated for possible misconduct by bar authorities. <P>

More than a year ago, the bar announced that it was investigating attorney conduct in the Simpson criminal case. No specific lawyer, however, has been identified as a target. <P>

But unlike Robert Shapiro, Johnnie Cochran Jr., and Alan Dershowitz, who wrote books afterwards, Kardashian has come under fire for possibly disclosing confidential attorney-client information. <P>

Unless he was given permission by Simpson to talk, which is unlikely but not out of the question, legal ethics specialists say Kardashian appears to have grossly violated the most basic bond between an attorney and client. <P>

If Kardashian did so, he may face disciplinary action by the bar, which could include disbarment. He could also be sued by Simpson for malpractice. <P>

"It would be a serious breach of attorney-client privilege if there was no permission," says L. Harold Levinson, who teaches legal ethics at Vanderbilt University School of Law. <P>

As a defense lawyer, "you've got to keep the ranks closed," adds San Francisco attorney and professional responsibility expert Richard Zitrin. Kardashian's revelations are likely considered "confidences and secrets of a client, and all that is confidential." <P>

Although only Simpson can reveal whether he gave Kardashian the green light to talk, the lawyer can be investigated by the bar without a formal complaint being filed. California bar authorities refused to say whether Simpson lodged a complaint against Kardashian. <P>

Kardashian did not respond to a faxed request for an interview. <P>

Kardashian's half-hour interview on Oct. 11 with the "20/20" program helped promote <I>American Tragedy: The Uncensored Story of the Simpson Defense</I>, a book co-written by journalists Lawrence Schiller and James Willwerth for which Kardashian was a paid source. (On the program, Kardashian refused to reveal any details about his financial arrangement with Schiller.) <P>

REVEALING ON TV <BR>
During the broadcast, a remorseful Kardashian unburdened himself as Barbara Walters gently prodded him to say more and more.  <P>

Kardashian told Walters that the defense team hired an attorney just to sit with Simpson in jail every day. The lawyer claimed that Shapiro had his own theory of the murder: That Simpson may have gone over to his ex-wife Nicole's house to slash her tires, but she caught him and he killed her. <P>

Kardashian also said that Simpson miserably failed a lie detector test taken at the behest of his lawyers; that both Shapiro and Cochran had doubts about Simpson's innocence; and that before the predominantly African-American jury visited Simpson's estate, members of his defense team did some strategic redecorating -- adding a print of a key moment in civil rights history, for example, and replacing a nude photo of his former girlfriend Paula Barbieri with a picture of his mother. <P>

Kardashian also bragged about saving Simpson "several times" from committing suicide and related how Simpson looked around Kardashian's home for a place to kill himself. <P>

"We walked around to maybe five locations on the premises," Kardashian told Walters. "And I was exasperated because O.J. kept saying 'I'll do it here, I'll do it there,' and everywhere he said, he didn't." <P>

It is comments like these, say legal ethics experts, that appear to breach Kardashian's duty to keep his client's confidences, unless the privilege was waived by Simpson. <P>

California has some of the most stringent lawyer-client confidentiality rules in the country. Instead of putting the strictures in a legal ethics rule, as many states do, California embeds them in a statute, giving them the force of law. <P>

"It is the duty of an attorney . . . to maintain inviolate the confidence, and at every peril to himself or herself to preserve the secrets, of his or her client," the statute reads. <P>

Ethics specialists say that the "secrets" provision is what makes the California rules so stringent. <P>

"Secrets are generally defined as anything you learn through the course of the representation which could be embarrassing to the client," says Zitrin, who in addition to his practice teaches ethics at two San Francisco law schools. <P>

Just about all of Kardashian's remarks on "20/20" can reasonably be construed to be an embarrassment to Simpson, says Zitrin.  <P>

Kardashian ducked a question from Walters about whether his interview violated Simpson's confidences. <P>

"I am on the witness list for the civil trial, and that is something the court will have to determine at that time," Kardashian said. <P>

Indeed, Kardashian may be subpoenaed to testify in that trial. The conditions of his testimony, if it is allowed at all, will likely provoke a major battle. (Earlier this year, Kardashian sat for two days of depositions and refused to answer most of the plaintiffs' lawyers' questions, saying that to do so would violate Simpson's attorney-client privilege.) <P>

Even if Kardashian's interview and help with the book breached his duty to keep private Simpson's confidences, that does not mean that he can be compelled to testify about them in court, ethics experts say. The attorney-client privilege belongs to the client, not the lawyer. <P>

"A lawyer who reveals [information] unethically cannot waive the privilege by himself," says Stephen Gillers, an ethics specialist at New York University School of Law. "Simpson can say, 'It's not my fault that he did this.' " <P>

Complicating matters is the fact that Kardashian is Simpson's close friend and has also been his attorney from time to time. Trial junkies know Kardashian as the man who went to meet Simpson in his driveway after he returned from Chicago and who ended up leaving with Simpson's garment bag before police could look in it. While many speculated that the bag contained bloody clothes or the murder weapon, Kardashian says he never opened it. <P>

Kardashian is also the man who, after Simpson fled the Los Angeles police who were coming to arrest him, read the "suicide note" on television and begged him to come home. <P>

Although Simpson and Kardashian had some financial dealings together over the years, Kardashian was not his personal lawyer. In fact, Kardashian, who long ago gave up the practice of law for the world of business, reactivated his bar membership shortly after the murders. <P>

While their friendship blurs the lines of Kardashian's representation of Simpson, there is no doubt that an attorney-client relationship existed between the two, at least in the early stages of the criminal case. <P>

While being deposed for his civil trial, Simpson said he consulted with Kardashian "almost immediately" after returning from Chicago the day after the murders. <P>

"I didn't have to contact him -- he came. He came to the house," Simpson said in the deposition. "I kinda relied on him a little bit from that point on." <P>

It is possible that Simpson released Kardashian from his privilege so that Kardashian could help with the book. Simpson could have granted a waiver as partial payment for legal services or because the two are close friends. Simpson himself could be profiting from the book. <P>

Simpson was asked during his deposition for the civil trial whether he had released Kardashian from his attorney-client privilege. Not surprisingly, Simpson declined to answer the question, citing the privilege. <P>

However, if Simpson did waive the privilege, he risks giving up his right to block Kardashian from testifying at the civil trial -- which could prove disastrous for Simpson. <P>

Thus far, most of what Kardashian has revealed would be inadmissible hearsay or opinion in the civil trial. Some lawyers say Kardashian's statements could hurt Simpson by tainting the jury. The information also provides a more detailed picture for the plaintiffs' lawyers to draw upon as they make their case. <P>

However, Kardashian's comments pertaining to Simpson's flirtation with suicide might be admissible as possible evidence of Simpson's consciousness of guilt. <P>

Ultimately, Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki will decide whether and to what extent Kardashian will be allowed to testify in the civil trial. <P>

"Much of what [Kardashian] has said is not admissible," says Professor Paul Rothstein of Georgetown University Law Center, who has closely followed Simpson's criminal and civil proceedings. "But there is still material there that could hurt O.J." <P>

<H2>Families. v. Simpson: A Trial Primer</H2>

<P>After winning acquittal last year in a criminal trial, O. J. Simpson is defending himself once again, this time on civil charges. The families of Ronald Goldman and Nicole Simpson are suing Simpson on behalf of the estates of the murder victims for wrongful death. The families are seeking unspecified monetary damages, claiming Simpson is responsible for the June 12, 1994 stabbings. If the jury finds for them, Simpson may lose his fortune -- but not his freedom. He cannot go to jail as a result of this civil action. </P>

<P>Wrongful-death suits are common in the civil justice system. After a fatal plane crash, an airline is typically sued by victims' families. However, a wrongful death suit after a homicide is rare, especially when the defendant has been acquitted of criminal charges. But unlike most homicide defendants, Simpson is wealthy, which makes him a more likely target. (The extent of Simpson's wealth was the subject of a pre-trial deposition, which the court sealed.) </P>

<P>But in this case, the families apparently have other motives besides money. Denise Brown's heart-rending testimony of the domestic abuse she says her sister suffered and Fredric Goldman's outbursts on the courthouse steps during the criminal trial indicate that both families want to see Simpson tell the world what he was doing on the night of the murders. At the criminal trial, Simpson's Fifth Amendment privilege protected him from being forced to testify. Because he was acquitted, Simpson cannot invoke his Fifth Amendment right.</P>

<P>Although it may seem like Simpson is being charged with the same crime twice, he is not. Experts in civil law point out that the criminal trial is the responsibility of the state and that the crime victims have no hand in the proceedings. The civil justice system allows victims and their survivors to settle their differences with the defendant in a legal arena.</P>

<P>"The civil system is partly designed for people to come to court and resolve their deeply felt anxieties and hatreds, and get vindication there instead of privately," says Barbara Babcok, a professor at Stanford Law School.</P>

<P>The biggest difference between the civil and criminal trial: Instead of needing to find Simpson guilty "beyond a reasonable doubt" as in the criminal case, the civil jury will decide if he is liable based on a "preponderance of evidence." In lay terms, that means more than 50 percent. Another key difference: California law says that only nine of the 12 jurors need to come to agreement to reach a verdict.</P>

<P>The cast of characters in the civil trial will be partly familiar and partly new. Expected to testify from the criminal trial are Brian "Kato" Kaelin, limousine driver Allan Park, and -- through videotaped testimony -- forensic expert Dr. Henry Lee, among others.</P>

<P>New testimony may come from Paula Barbieri, Robert Kardashian, and A.C. Cowlings. It is unclear whether Detective Mark Fuhrman will testify, although the defense served him with a subpoena. The most watched witness, of course, will be Simpson himself. The attorneys handling the case are almost all different than in the criminal trial. The only member of  Simpson's "dream team" of criminal defense lawyers working on the civil case is Robert Blaiser.</P>

<P>Superior Court Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki pulled the plug on television cameras inside the courtroom and imposed a gag order that prevents lawyers from putting a spin on the day's events after each court session. Lawyers may only talk to the press to explain the legal proceedings.</P>

<P><B>The Suits:</B><BR>
Several suits have been consolidated for this trial. Goldman's mother Sharon Rufo and father Fred Goldman have both filed wrongful death suits against Simpson for the loss of companionship of their son. They are divorced and Ronald had been estranged from his mother. A jury could award different damages to each parent.</P>

<P>The estate of Ronald Goldman, represented by both parents, has also filed a survivor claim against Simpson. To win this type of suit in California, the plaintiffs must show that Goldman survived, albeit briefly, the attack. In a survivor suit, the plaintiff's claim of actual damages is low. But unlike a wrongful death suit, the plaintiff can win money for punitive damages.</P>

<P>Nicole Brown Simpson's estate, represented by her parents, has also filed a survivor claim against O.J. Simpson. Interestingly, no wrongful death suit has been filed against Simpson by the Browns. The actual plaintiffs in a wrongful death suit would be O.J. and Nicole's two young children Sydney and Justin. Under California law they could still file suit against their father until they turn 19.</P>

<P><B>The Plaintiffs' Case: </B><BR>
From early indications, the plaintiffs will probably try to paint a broader picture of the events leading up to the June 12, 1994 murders than prosecutors did in the criminal trial -- and they will try to do it in less time. They don't want to get bogged down in long DNA testimony, nor do they want to go into great detail about the forensic evidence -- especially because the Los Angeles police were shown to have made a number of mistakes in the criminal trial. Expect more evidence about domestic violence, possibly including excerpts from Nicole's diary, which was ruled hearsay in the criminal trial. A new California law, passed in reaction to the Simpson criminal case, may allow the plaintiffs to introduce it. Judge Fujisaki will rule on the admissibility during trial. The plaintiffs also may bring up evidence that was not used by the prosecution in the criminal trial. This may include: testimony about Simpson's low-speed chase with the LAPD, the money and disguise he took with him when fleeing arrest, and his purported suicide note. New evidence will likely include a freelance photographer's picture of Simpson apparently wearing Bruno Magli shoes, which he said he never owned.</P>

<P><B>The Defense's Case:</B><BR>
Simpson's defense team has been very close-mouthed about its legal strategy. But the motions they have filed so far in court suggest they will follow a similar defense as was used  in the criminal trial. Expect the defense to challenge the LAPD at every turn. Even if Mark Fuhrman does not testify, his name will likely be bandied about the courtroom at every possible opportunity. Because of Fuhrman's Oct. 2 no contest plea to perjury charges, Judge Fujisaki has allowed the defense to raise questions about the planting of some evidence, including the bloody glove found in Simpson's yard. </P>

<P><B>The Plaintiffs' Lawyers:</B><BR>
All three plaintiffs have separate counsel. Their biggest challenge for the case will likely be working together. While each has a different client with slightly different interests, they are all working toward a common goal: proving Simpson liable for the murders. A united front will keep them from unnecessarily prolonging the case and boring the jury. </P>

<P>Fred Goldman's lawyer, Daniel Petrocelli, has taken the lead for the plaintiffs in court so far. A noted corporate civil lawyer in Los Angeles, Petrocelli's focus has been on complex civil litigation. He does not have a vast amount of trial experience. His past clients include Guess Inc., Saban Entertainment, and Occidental Petroleum.</P>

<P>Sharon Rufo, Ronald Goldman's mother, is being represented by Michael Brewer. He filed the first wrongful death suit against Simpson in July 1994. Brewer has handled a number of wrongful death suits and seen a lot of courtroom action, though often on the defense side.</P>

<P>John Kelly, a former deputy district attorney in Queens County, N.Y., is handling the case for the Nicole Brown Simpson estate. He has worked as a criminal defense attorney and as a civil litigator.</P>

<P><B>The Defendant's Lawyers:</B><BR>
Simpson's lead attorney is Robert Baker, one of the most prominent civil litigators in Los Angeles. Practicing out of his own law firm in Santa Monica, Baker has 25 years experience concentrating mainly in medical malpractice and product liability cases. He has defended numerous wrongful death suits. Baker's son Phillip is also helping out on the defense, as is former Simpson criminal lawyer Robert Blaiser, who is working on scientific evidence matters. F. Lee Bailey and attorneys with his office have been named on some of the briefs and attended some depositions, but it is unclear what role Bailey is playing in the civil trial. He has not yet been in court.</P>

<P><B>The Judge:</B><BR>
Superior Court Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki is  the second judge assigned to the civil trial. The defense challenged and had removed the first judge, Alan Haber. Fujisaki, 60, has said he will retire when this case has finished. </P>

<P>A former public defender, Fujisaki has been on the bench since 1980 and has even handled celebrity trials before, presiding over cases involving Jack Nicholson, Gary Coleman, and Zsa Zsa Gabor. In issuing a gag order on trial participants and banning the TV camera from the courtroom, Fujisaki derided the first trial as a  "media circus." He has vowed that this trial will be different. On the first day of the trial, he issued 39 rulings and let the lawyers know he plans to keep the case closely focused on whether or not Simpson killed his former wife and Ronald Goldman.</P>

<H2>Simpson Jury Profile</H2>

<P><B>SEAT #1. Juror #199</B> -- A postal worker and union member who is of mixed black and Asian heritage. He appears to be in his mid 20s or early 30s. He was born in Jamaica, has a bachelor's degree from Fresno State University, and followed the Simpson criminal trial on TV simply for entertainment.</P>

<P><B>SEAT #2. Juror #341</B> -- A white female bank worker who appears to be in her 60s. She thinks the LAPD did a good job. But she said she distrusted retired police detective Mark Fuhrman.

<P><B>SEAT #3. Juror #186</B> -- A white man who appears to be in his 30s. He said he found the DNA evidence presented in the criminal trial "compelling." He said he developed a passing interest in DNA science after watching the movie "Jurassic Park."  He expressed concern that there could have be a riot if Simpson had been convicted in the criminal trial.</P>

<P><B>SEAT #4. Juror #78</B> -- A woman of mixed white and Latin origin who has a background in theater. She appears to be in her 20s. She considers herself analytical but does not follow current events and has no opinion on Simpson's guilt. She said "O.J. is not a celebrity to me."</P>

<P><B>SEAT #5. Juror #266</B> -- A white woman who works as a stage manager in a non-profit theater. She appears to be in her 30s or 40s. She said she had no preconceived notions about Simpson's guilt or innocence and understands a little about DNA from high school science.</P>

<P><B>SEAT #6. Juror #257</B> -- A Hispanic woman who appears to be in her 20s or 30s. At the beginning of the criminal trial she thought Simpson was guilty. But "other things came up" that gave her doubt.</P>

<P><B>SEAT #7. Juror #333</B> -- A black woman who appears to be in her 60s. She said her neighborhood experienced rioting after the Rodney King verdict. But she insisted that won't stop her from delivering a verdict that may be unpopular in her community.  She also expressed sympathy for Fred Goldman. "It's a parent's worst nightmare to have your child die before you," she said.</P>

<P><B>SEAT #8. Juror #290</B> -- A white man who appears to be in his 40s. He said he didn't watch much of the criminal trial. But he believes Simpson received preferential treatment because of the football legend's celebrity status. He described himself as a "good listener."</P>

<P><B>SEAT #9. Juror #326</B> -- A white man who appears to be in his 50s. He said he's not sure about Simpson's guilt or innocence and didn't pay attention to the last trial, though he had heard there was "tainted" evidence and believes police are sometimes involved in cover-ups.</P>

<P><B>SEAT #10. Juror #400</B> -- A white woman who appears to be in her 60s. She said her husband thinks Simpson is guilty of the murders, but "we disagree a lot."

<P><B>Alternate Jurors</B><BR>
<B>SEAT #1: Juror #369</B> -- An Asian male who appears to be in his 30s. He is a computer programmer who believes planting of evidence is possible. "I'm neutral," he said.</P>

<P><B>SEAT #2: Juror #206</B> -- A white male who appears to be in his 60s. He is a retired medical diagnostic lab worker. He said he knew little about the case because he was more concerned with problems in Yugoslavia.</P>

<TITLE>Court TV Casefiles -- Live Chat with Jeff Toobin</TITLE>

<P>Jeff Toobin, author of the bestseller, "The Run of His Life: The People v. O.J. Simpson," was Court TV's guest Sept. 24, 1996. He talked about covering the criminal trial for the New Yorker, his new book, and his thoughts on the upcoming civil trial.</P>
<HR WIDTH=525 ALIGN=LEFT>

<P> CourtTV9: Good evening. Welcome to Court TV's live chat with Jeff Toobin, author of "The Run of His Life," a current best seller on the Simpson trial. The book includes several startling claims about the criminal trial. According to Mr. Toobin, Simpson received advance notice of the verdict from his jailhouse guards; his lawyers Johnnie  Cochran and Robert Shapiro thought their client was guilty; and Lance Ito privately disclosed the contents of a crucial court ruling to CNN's Larry King before he announced it to the public. Hello, Jeff.</P>

<P>Jeff Toobin: Hello, it's good to be with everyone.</P>

<P>CourtTV9: We've got a lot of people online tonight and the questions are pouring in. Let's get right to them.</P>

<P>Question: In your book, you talk about the police interview with O.J. after the murders as a great example of sloppy police work. The whole interview is only about 30 minutes. Do you think the case was lost there?</P>

<P>Jeff Toobin: No, it wasn't the end of the case. But it was indicative of the extreme deference paid to O.J. by the cops.</P>

<P>Question: What is the relationship between the Browns and the Goldmans?</P>

<P>Jeff Toobin: It's pretty icy. They are allies. But the Goldmans recognize that the Browns had been in O.J.'s thrall for many years.</P>

<P>Question: What do you think the outcome of the civil trial will be?</P>

<P>Jeff Toobin: I think the plaintiffs will win, largely, alas, because of the whiter jury pool. Race means everything in this case.</P>

<P>CourtTV9: I hear the jury pool at this point is 50/.50 black to white. What does that mean?</P>

<P>Jeff Toobin: A colleague of mine who was in the courtroom today says it's just like the criminal case -- blacks for O.J., whites for plaintiffs. It could mean a hung jury.</P>

<P>Question: Do you think Marcus Allen played a larger role in this entire event than the public was led to believe?</P>

<P>Jeff Toobin: No. He had an affair with Nicole, but O.J.'s anger was directed at her, not him. Typical sexism.</P>

<P>Question: I hear your book is a best seller. What makes it different than all the others that have been written?</P>

<P>Jeff Toobin: I am a journalist, with no ax to grind. It's independent, not self-justifying.</P>

<P>Question: Do you think Faye Resnick is telling the truth when she speaks of O.J. Simpson's behavior in the past?</P>

<P>Jeff Toobin: Yes, by and large. But she greatly hurt the prosecution case by cashing in on her friendship with Nicole and abusing drugs. Ironically, she turned out to be one of the best friends O.J. had.</P>

<P>Question: What do you think of Vince Bugliosi's book, "Outrage"? I think your book is excellent.</P>

<P>Jeff Toobin: Thanks for the praise. Bugliosi made a lot of good points -- but it was marred by his egotism. I tried to show empathy for the lawyers, even when I criticized them. Bugliosi only wanted to show how smart he was.</P>

<P>Question: Do you think O.J. Simpson originally intended to kill himself after the murders?</P>

<P>Jeff Toobin: Absolutely not. He is far too much of a narcissist to ever consider killing himself.</P>

<P>Question: How is Simpson's search for the real killer going?</P>

<P>Jeff Toobin: He actually has had a private detective doing some work. But of course it's futile. He needs only to look in the bathroom mirror for the real killer.</P>

<P>Question: How did you do the research for your book?</P>

<P>Jeff Toobin: I attended the trial and interviewed more than 200 participants, both during and after the trial</P>

<P>Question: In Chris Darden's book, there was some speculation that O.J. was running to a boat headed for the Caribbean. Is this true?</P>

<P>Jeff Toobin: I don't believe it. The events of 6/17/94 were too chaotic for such an elaborate plan.</P>

<P>Question: Didn't Dr. Henry Lee find blood on the air conditioner?</P>

<P>Jeff Toobin: That's news to me.</P>

<P>Question: I would like to know why no one believes that Mark Fuhrman could have planted evidence when, by his own statements, he is the worst kind of racist there is?</P>

<P>Jeff Toobin: He had no opportunity. He was the 17th officer on scene, had no independent access to evidence, no knowledge if O.J. was even in the U.S. at time of murders. Fuhrman sued me for libel (and later dropped case), so I'm no friend of his. But I don't believe he could have or did plant evidence.</P>

<P>Question: Jeff: Don't you worry that folks will find your opinions racist? What would Mal Goode think if he were still alive?</P>

<P>Jeff Toobin: Mal Goode was one of my heroes, a great friend of my mother's, in fact. It is not racism to speak the truth. It is shameful that O.J.'s cause has somehow become a civil rights issue. It demeans a great cause to be associated with him.</P>

<P>Question: Do you believe that, at this time, O.J. is possibly suicidal or very distressed, solely due to the guilt he lives with?</P>

<P>Jeff Toobin: Hard question. I think the chase was mostly O.J.'s attempt to generate sympathy for himself. He didn't have the courage to kill himself (if that is the right word).</P>

<P>Question: It looks like jury selection is splitting along racial lines, does this surprise you?</P>

<P>Jeff Toobin: Not really. Alas, race really is the story of this case. The civil trial is turning out to be no different than the criminal case. What a sad statement.</P>

<P>Question: Do you think Marcia Clark did a good job of prosecuting the criminal trial?</P>

<P>Jeff Toobin: Mixed. She is a skilled trial lawyer -- great opening statement, great direct exams of Lange and Alan Park. But her arrogance is a problem -- rejecting jury consultant's advice, embracing Fuhrman, etc.</P>

<P>Question: Why in the original trial did the prosecutors fail to use the Bronco chase and note?</P>

<P>Jeff Toobin: That evidence is ambiguous and could have generated sympathy for O.J. The theory was that if they didn't believe the DNA evidence, etc., they wouldn't have been persuaded by chase and note. I think the prosecutors were right on this issue.</P>

<P>Question: Are you going to report or write about the civil case? If not, why not , and if so -why?</P>

<P>Jeff Toobin: Not a lot, maybe not at all. I live in NYC, I can't impose long absences on my family any more. Otherwise, I might be willing to do it.</P>

<P>Question: What did you think the outcome of the civil trial will be?</P>

<P>Jeff Toobin: If I had to bet, I would say the plaintiffs will win. But racial polarization seems already to be setting in. That means a possible hung jury.</P>

<P>Question: Who do you think will get custody of the kids?</P>

<P>Jeff Toobin: O.J. doesn't really want custody. He wants to annoy the Browns. The final decision will be shared custody along the limes they have now.</P>

<P>Question: Does the LAPD realize how badly it botched this case?</P>

<P>Jeff Toobin: Not fully. Mostly, they blame the defense lawyers and the jury. Typical LAPD arrogance.</P>

<P>Question: Please share what you know about Shapiro's knowledge of O.J.'s guilt/innocence.</P>

<P>Jeff Toobin: As I say in my book, Shapiro told several friends during the trial that he thought O.J. was guilty.</P>

<P>Question: What about Simpson's comment to Roger Cossack today regarding his "not having anything to give those people", implying that he was broke?</P>

<P>Jeff Toobin: It's Probably true. O.J. has less money than people think. The Rockingham house is mortgaged heavily and he has a big IRS tax lien. The Goldmans will get a symbolic victory at best.</P>

<P>Question: Do you think Ron Shipp had anything to do with "Smoothing" over things with the police dept.  in regard to considering O.J. as a prime suspect or could he have possibly been the Person that "set up" O.J?</P>

<P>Jeff Toobin: Shipp helped O.J. out of his 1989 domestic violence case But he had nothing to do with the aftermath of the murders. He seems genuinely conscience stricken to me.</P>

<P>CourtTV9: You kind of paint Fuhrman as a good cop in that respect. True?</P>

<P>Jeff Toobin: Again, a mixed bag. He was very bad in the early 80s, but he seemed to have cleaned up his act in later years. He had many backers (black and white) in LAPD and district attorney's office.</P>

<P>Question: Was Rosie Greer deposed in the civil case?</P>

<P>Jeff Toobin: I doubt it. The priest-penitent privilege applies in civil as well. But while we're on subject, I do don't think there's a chance in the world that O.J. confessed to Rosie. O.J. has confessed to no one, I believe.</P>

<P>Question: Is it true Kardashian said O.J. is guilty?</P>

<P>Jeff Toobin: It's not in my book, but I wouldn't be surprised.</P>

<P>Question: Did O.J. set up Swiss accounts in the event that the civil suit did not go his way?</P>

<P>Jeff Toobin: Not a chance. He does not have the money at this point to justify such a move. He has always spent m his large income. He wasn't a saver.</P>

<P>Question: Does your book deal with the aspects of the blatant misuse of the jury system by the black jury!</P>

<P>Jeff Toobin: I believe that the verdict was very much determined by race, if that's what you mean.</P>

<P>Question: What ever happened with the mysterious envelope?</P>

<P>Jeff Toobin: It contained the knife O.J. bought at Ross Cutlery, shortly before murders. There is a full account of this saga in my book.</P>

<P>Question: Do you believe the viewpoint that most blacks think that O.J. is innocent?</P>

<P>Jeff Toobin: Alas, yes. That is borne out by the survey research data.</P>

<P>CourtTV9: What is your next move? What are you writing about now?</P>

<P>Jeff Toobin: I'll be covering Oklahoma City bombing case in Denver for the New Yorker.</P>

<P>CourtTV9: How is that going?</P>

<P>Jeff Toobin: I have a profile of Mike Tigar, Terry Nichols lawyer, in current issue of the New Yorker. This is a totally fascinating case, with great lawyers on all sides. It should be on TV because it would make people proud of the judicial system.</P>

<P>CourtTV9: How come people don't care about this case the way they care about Simpson?</P>

<P>Jeff Toobin: No sex, no race, no Hollywood, no dog.</P>

<P>CourtTV9: Any closing remarks?</P>

<P>Jeff Toobin: This has been fun. I remain astonished at how passionate people continue to feel about the Simpson case almost a year after the verdict.</P>

<P>CourtTV9: Why is that so?</P>

<P>Jeff Toobin: It's become almost like abortion. Your feelings about this case seem to encapsulate your feelings about a whole set of issues.</P>

<P>CourtTV9: I want to thank Jeff Toobin. His book,. "The Run of His Life ," published by Random House is a best seller.</P>

<P>Jeff Toobin: Thanks for having me. See you around the web.</P>

<P>A week before the start of the Simpson wrongful-death trial, defense lawyer Robert Shapiro, who represented O.J. Simpson in the double murder trial, joined Court TV on America Online's Center Stage. Anchor Dan Abrams acted as moderator as Robert Shapiro took questions from the audience. The following is a transcript of that Sept. 9, 1996 event.</P>

<HR WIDTH=525 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P>

<P><B>CourtTV:</B> Hello everyone. We are ready to start. Robert Shapiro and Dan Abrams are on stage. Dan covered the first trial from LA. and he's going back there for the civil trial. What is the latest, Dan?</P>

<P><B>Dan Abrams:</B> The civil trial is expected to begin on Tuesday with motions. That is a week from Tuesday. And on Wednesday Sept. 18 Jury selection begins. Now lets welcome Robert Shapiro.</P>

<P><B>Robert Shapiro:</B> Thank you very much. And welcome to all the people on the Internet. First, I would like to apologize for having to cancel the interview two months ago when it was scheduled. I was on my book tour with "Search For Justice." And I was at a book signing in Birmingham, Alabama that ran about an hour and a half late and I promise Steve Brill, the president of Court TV, that I would reschedule at his convenience.</P>

<P><B>Dan Abrams:</B> Bob, I think a lot of people would like to know if you are still involved with the Simpson civil case.</P>

<P><B>Robert Shapiro:</B> No, I ended my representation of O. J. Simpson when the verdict was reached in the criminal trial.</P>

<P><B>Dan Abrams:</B> Now we will take questions from the audience.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> What will Dr. Henry Lee's position in the second trial be?</P>

<P><B>Robert Shapiro:</B> Since I am not involved in the second trial, I do not know if he will be called as a witness.</P>

<P><B>Dan Abrams:</B> Well, we expect that he will be called in a videotaped deposition -- but what he said remains a mystery.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> Mr. Shapiro, what is your opinion of Nicole Brown's diary?</P>

<P><B>Robert Shapiro:</B> The diary was not admissible evidence in the criminal trial since there was no way to authenticate it as being her true thoughts.</P>

<P><B>Dan Abrams:</B> But if it had been, would it have been devastating?</P>

<P><B>Robert Shapiro:</B> It achieves no purpose to speculate as to how the jury might have viewed the diary. It certainly was very sympathetic.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> Did O.J. take a polygraph test at your request, and if so, what did he score?</P>

<P><B>Robert Shapiro:</B> The rules of professional conduct in California as a result of the O. J. Simpson Case prohibit lawyers from commenting on anything that would materially affect the outcome of a trial. I adhere strictly to that rule. Therefore, it's a subject that I cannot comment on.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> We know that you were upset with the analogy of Fuhrman and Hitler. But what has the rest of the team's reaction been?</P>

<P><B>Robert Shapiro:</B> It's been my policy not to comment on the thoughts of other lawyers on the defense. I think my position has been made abundantly clear.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> What was the experience like writing the book?</P>

<P><B>Robert Shapiro:</B> Writing a book is a difficult and trying experience. There are tremendous limitations placed on lawyers because of the sanctity of the attorney-client privilege. There were many experiences that personally affected my wife and children that were most difficult to relate to the reader.</P>

<P><B>Dan Abrams:</B> You talk about relationships . . . do you still talk to any other members of the defense?</P>

<P><B>Robert Shapiro:</B> I speak frequently with Alan Dershowitz. I spoke with Gerry Uelman a week and a half ago. I talked with Bob Blasier last month. I traded phone calls recently with Barry Scheck. The only person on the defense team that I will not speak with is Mr. Bailey.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> Mr. Shapiro, Have you read Christopher Darden's book? If so what comment(s) do you have?</P>

<P><B>Robert Shapiro:</B> Christopher wrote a book primarily about his life that I found quite interesting. He's clearly a quite angry man and that comes across strongly.</P>

<P><B>Dan Abrams:</B> Do you think he had any right to be angry?</P>

<P><B>Robert Shapiro:</B> Certainly he had a right to be angry.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> Hi from Chicago. Mr. Robert Shapiro, what lesson, if any, did we learn from the Simpson trial?</P>

<P><B>Robert Shapiro:</B> [Laughter.] We don't have enough time to get into all the lessons. We saw for the first time how the American system of justice really works -- that the presumption of innocence and reasonable doubt are a big part of our liberty and freedom. It also taught America that the burden is on the prosecution to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> Hi Robert, how did it feel to be the lawyer of the most controversial case in the world?</P>

<P><B>Robert Shapiro:</B> From a personal standpoint, it had an effect on my wife and children. The fact that I did not take another case for nearly two years, that I devoted all my time to this trial, makes it a personal experience that I would not want to duplicate. From a professional standpoint, however, it was an experience I would not have wanted to miss.</P>

<P><B>Dan Abrams:</B> So if you had to decide, would you do it again?</P>

<P><B>Robert Shapiro:</B> If the decision was left solely to me, I would. If my wife and children were involved in the decision, clearly I would not.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> What do you think of the judge in this case. Folks say this will be his last trial.  Will that make a difference?</P>

<P><B>Robert Shapiro:</B> I think Judge Ito did a very good job under extremely difficult circumstances. We had 11 lawyers for this case. The prosecution had in excess of 40. And Judge Ito had a staff of three law students. Many of the issues in this case were raised for the first time. He was the first one to arrive at the courthouse and the last one to leave. He researched and drafted all of his own opinions. He kept together a jury that was on the verge of mutiny and allowed a verdict to be reached.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> If you feel like your client is truly guilty, do you feel you still have an obligation to represent him/her till the verdict?</P>

<P><B>Robert Shapiro:</B> First, it is not a lawyer's role to determine guilt or innocence. That is up to the judge or the jury. Very few cases are like the O. J. Simpson Case -- a classic "Who Done It." Most cases are based on facts that are not disputed. In the majority of cases ,if two people got into a fight and one person died, the facts might not be in dispute. But the crime that was committed may vary -- from an assault, to an assault with an intent to do bodily harm,  to a first degree murder (if it was premeditated). Clearly, if a person died, it could also be a case of self defense. These are questions for juries, not for lawyers.</P>

<P><B>Dan Abrams:</B> But to follow up, if a client tells you "I did it but get me off." What should a lawyer do?</P>

<P><B>Robert Shapiro:</B> I recently defended a person who came to my office and told me he killed his wife and dumped her body on the highway. I immediately advised him to surrender to the police. The case was tried and the testimony revealed that this man had been in a relationship where his wife decided to have sex with another man -- while he watched. After a period of time, he found his wife having sex with this man, and as a result, he pulled a gun in anger and shot his wife. Psychiatric testimony showed that he had diminished capacity. And even though he felt he was guilty of murder, he was convicted of manslaughter.</P>

<P><B>Dan Abrams:</B> So any time someone says, "I did it," he or she is mentally infirm?</P>

<P><B>Robert Shapiro:</B> No, definitely not. The question is one of degree. The person is saying he is responsible for the act that caused the death. But the trier of fact is the one who decides whether it's first degree murder, second degree murder, voluntary manslaughter, involuntary manslaughter or self defense.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> You said the prosecution over-tried its case. How would you have prosecuted the Simpson case if you were in Marcia Clark's shoes?</P>

<P><B>Robert Shapiro:</B> First, I would not have brought the charges until the investigation was completed. One week after the murders, the prosecution announced that O. J. Simpson was the sole murderer. [The prosecution went on to say that it ] would not be surprised if somewhere down the line he would have admitted his guilt and used the Menendez defense before any DNA evidence was analyzed.</P>

<P><B>Dan Abrams:</B> We are going to wrap and have Hank Goldberg in a few minutes. But what about during the trial? What would you have done differently if you were the prosecutor?</P>

<P><B>Robert Shapiro:</B> Well, clearly the glove demonstration was something that no experienced lawyer would have done in front of a jury. Also, the prosecution bored the jury on the forensic evidence. Rather than qualifying a witness as an expert and asking for an opinion of the results, they tried to explain to a lay jury the science that was nearly impossible to understand. They did this again with the coroner, where they spent eight days of court testimony establishing that two people died of knife wounds. When you bore a jury, you lose a jury.</P>

<P><B>Dan Abrams:</B> Well we will have prosecutor Hank Goldberg to respond but I really want to thank Robert Shapiro for joining us.</P>

<P>A week before the start of the Simpson wrongful-death trial, Hank Goldberg, one of the prosecutors in the O.J. Simpson Case, joined Court TV on America Online's Center Stage. Anchor Dan Abrams acted as moderator as Goldberg took questions from the audience. The following is a transcript of that Sept. 9, 1996 event.</P>

<HR WIDTH=525 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P>

<P><B>Dan Abrams:</B> Hank, Robert Shapiro said just before that the prosecution bored the jury with the physical evidence and that you made it impossible to understand. How do you respond?</P>

<P><B>Hank Goldberg:</B> Well, this is revisionist history in the extreme. Those that watched the trial will recall that Woody Clark, who presented the bulk of the DNA evidence, according to all who watched, did an outstanding job. And if you look back at the trial -- and take Dennis Fung for an example, who I presented -- I had him on the stand for a day and a half, and he was cross-examined for 7 days. So much of the boredom and confusion was generated by the defense.</P>

<P><B>Dan Abrams:</B> But the cross of Fung was effective, wasn't it?</P>

<P><B>Hank Goldberg:</B> No. The cross of Fung was designed to accomplish two ends: First, to suggest that Dennis may have contaminated the evidence. However, by the end of the case, during Barry Scheck's argument, he conceded that the evidence was not contaminated during the collection phase. The second purpose for the cross-examination was to attempt to show that Dennis was involved in a conspiracy to convict Simpson. For example, they suggested that he didn't really obtain the vial of Simpson's blood from Det. Vannatter at Rockingham. However, during the redirect examination, I was able to produce video tape from news footage to prove that Dennis was telling the truth about having received the blood vial. So both objectives of the cross-examination failed.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> How do you feel about that photo of Simpson apparently in Bruno Maglis [shoes]. Do you think that photographer will be a big witness? Will he make a difference in the civil trial?</P>

<P><B>Hank Goldberg:</B> I saw the photo, and it appears to me to be Bruno Maglis shoes that Simpson is wearing. The defense contention will probably be that the photograph has been doctored. So in the criminal case, our jury was very receptive to believing those conspiracy allegations. And it remains to be seen if the civil jury will be any different.</P>

<P><B>Dan Abrams:</B> Do you blame Marcia Clark and Bill Hodgman for picking a "bad" jury?</P>

<P><B>Hank Goldberg:</B> No. Marcia and Bill were aware every time that they exercised a challenge to kick someone off the jury. They were aware of who the replacements would be. So they needed to gauge whether the replacement juror was likely to be better than the person they just challenged. And they were faced with the situation where they felt the replacement jurors were likely to be worse than the people they were considering challenging.</P>

<P><B>Dan Abrams:</B> So if there was no way to get a fair jury in downtown L.A. wasn't it a mistake not to try the case in Santa Monica?</P>

<P><B>Hank Goldberg:</B> Some people have argued that the prosecution should have filed the case in Santa Monica for the purpose of getting a jury that had more white people on it. I personally find that argument reprehensible because the prosecution must make it's decisions in a race neutral, color-blind manner.  This means that we should not consider which jury would have the most white people on it, or the fewest African-Americans. If we had considered that -- if we had taken the race of the jurors into account -- it would have been unconstitutional and unfair.</P>

<P><B>Dan Abrams:</B> But you have said that Clark and Hodgman had no choice but to, in essence, pick jurors who had already made a decision about how they would vote. Might you have found a jury you think is fairer in Santa Monica or somewhere else?</P>

<P><B>Hank Goldberg:</B> I believe that had the trial been held in Santa Monica, that a significant percentage of the jurors would have had biases against the prosecution similar to the attitude that many of the jurors downtown had. The most probable result in Santa Monica would have been a hung jury.</P>

<P><B>Dan Abrams:</B> So no prosecutors could have gotten a conviction anywhere in the LA area?</P>

<P><B>Hank Goldberg:</B> I think it would have been very difficult, and the reason is that I believe that the outcome of the trial was dictated by four very powerful social forces. First, the issue of celebrity status; second, the issue of the media coverage and the distorting influence it had in the trial; third, the issue of race; and fourth, the issue of sexism as it relates to the domestic violence evidence. We would have confronted those four factors anywhere in Los Angeles County.</P>

<P><B>Dan Abrams:</B> But Vincent Bugliosi says he could have won a conviction?</P>

<P><B>Hank Goldberg:</B> When you read Bugliosi's book very carefully, he never comes out and says that he could have won a conviction in front of the jury that we had downtown.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> What has your career been like since the trial? Are you still a working prosecutor, unlike most of the rest of your team? And what's your book like?</P>

<P><B>Hank Goldberg:</B> I'm still working for the District Attorney's office as a prosecutor, which is a job that I enjoy and feel privileged to do. My book gives a behind the scenes view of the trial. In essence, it invites the reader into the offices of the District Attorney, to sit down with us and listen in on the conversations that we had about the key tactical and strategic issues in the case. It is my hope that in revealing this information, the reader will be able to come to their own conclusions about what really happened and why.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> How'd you graduate law school at 22? Is that some sort of record? What is your position on cameras in court in big trials?</P>

<P><B>Hank Goldberg:</B> I finished my undergraduate work at UCLA when I was 19. I did that by taking a number of college credit courses while I was in high school. Regarding cameras in the courtroom, I am opposed to them in high profile cases where there is a danger of creating a media circus. In my view, the Simpson case was such a case.</P>

<P><B>Dan Abrams:</B> Well, the circus was created outside the courtroom not in it. But let me point out that if you want to see a picture of Hank with a Leif Garretesque hairdo buy the book and look at the picture of him just out of college.</P>

<P><B>Hank Goldberg:</B> I believe that the media circus existed both outside and in the courtroom. The best example within the courtroom was the constant speeches that occurred virtually every morning, particularly by the defense. On the Mark Fuhrman issue, for example, when the North Carolina court ruled that Laura McKinney would not have to appear in California to testify to the infamous Fuhrman/McKinney tapes, the following morning Cochran gave his famous "this is a bombshell" speech. This speech as obviously not directed towards Judge Ito, because Judge Ito had no jurisdiction over a North Carolina matter -- so the intended audience was the people watching the case on television.</P>

<P><B>Dan Abrams:</B> Maybe. But we find that good judges can shut the lawyers up when necessary.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> To Hank Goldberg: Do you feel in retrospect that Brian Kelberg's questioning of Dr. Lakshmanan was too lengthy?</P>

<P><B>Hank Goldberg:</B> No, the prosecution was in no way harmed from Brian Kelberg's lengthy direct examination. Brian's objective was to front every potential issue that the defense might raise on cross-examination. His objective was to leave the defense in a position where they would have little or nothing left to raise on cross-examination. He was successful in the sense that Robert Shapiro's cross examination was extremely short, unlike the 7 day cross-examination of Dennis Fung. So I would not second guess Brian's tactical decision.</P>

<P><B>Dan Abrams:</B> You defend all of the prosecution's decisions. Were there any major mistakes?</P>

<P><B>Hank Goldberg:</B> If the mistake is to find in terms of something that had it been done differently, the outcome would have been different, then no. The prosecution did not make any mistakes. However, in any trial of this complexity, there are always going to be issues that we might have handled better, and one example would be the glove demonstration. But in terms of something that would have effected the outcome, I don't believe that had we handled the case differently, there would have been a different outcome.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> In the civil trial they have a chance to depose a lot of people you couldn't subpoena for pretrial interviews. How big a factor is that in the civil trial?</P>

<P><B>Hank Goldberg:</B> It's a significant factor. In a criminal prosecution in California, prosecutors are not allowed to use depositions in order to take statements from reluctant witnesses. For example, Simpson's former girlfriend, Paula Barbieri did not want to give a statement to the prosecution. However, when the plaintiffs took her deposition in the civil matter, according to the reports, she made a statement to the effect that she had broken up with Simpson shortly before the murders. This is an illustration of the civil discovery process being used to ferret out new information.</P>

<P><B>Question:</B> Did you read Toobin's piece in the New Yorker? What do you think of it?</P>

<P><B>Hank Goldberg:</B> I didn't read it.</P>

<P><B>Dan Abrams:</B> Toobin's article blamed Marcia Clark for failing to pick the right "type" of jurors. He said that the defense attorneys said they knew Simpson was guilty and that Simpson knew the verdict the night before.</P>

<P><B>Hank Goldberg:</B> Well, regarding Marcia allegedly not picking the right jurors, my response is the same as the one I gave earlier. That is, it assumes that the replacement jurors would have been better than the jurors that Marcia was considering excluding. Regarding the other statements about the mental state of the defense attorneys, it is a meaningless piece of trivia. It makes no difference in understanding the outcome of the trial, or what happened during the trial.</P>

<P><B>Dan Abrams:</B> So as the final question I will ask you the one everyone asks me. . . do you think the families will win? yes or no?</P>

<P><B>Hank Goldberg:</B> I think so. There are several factors to take into consideration. First, in the civil case, the standard of proof is "preponderance of the evidence," not proof "beyond a reasonable doubt." That's a much easier standard of proof to meet. Second, the plaintiffs need only convince nine of twelve jurors. And third, the plaintiffs have the advantage of the civil discovery process which we talked about earlier.</P>

<P><B>Dan Abrams:</B> Simpson prosecutor and author of The Prosecution Responds, Hank Goldberg, Thanks.</P>

<P><B>Hank Goldberg:</B> I've appreciated being a part of this discussion. And I hope that we can all finally come to learn the truth of what really happened in the case and why.</P>

Superior Court for the State of California in and for the County of
Orange

In re the Guardianship of:

Sydney Brooke Simpson

Justin Ryan Simpson

Case No. A 174254

FINDINGS AND ORDER

The Court having considered the evidence produced at hearing, the
matter having been submitted on arguments of counsel, the Court enters
the following orders on Orenthal James Simpson's petition to terminate
the guardianship over minors Sydney Brook Simpson and Justin Ryan
Simpson:

The petition is GRANTED. The guardianship over the minors is
terminated. The Court finds that the respondent guardians Lou and
Juditha Brown have failed to demonstrate by clear and convincing
evidence that custody of the minors by their father would be clearly
detrimental to their well being. The Court orders grandparent
visitation with the minors, finding that there is an intact, stable,
bonded, healthy relationship between the minors and their maternal
grandparents and that regular visitation is in the minors' best
interests.

The Proceedings:

The minors, Sydney Brooke Simpson DOB 10/17/85 and Justin Ryan Brown
DOB 8/6/88, are the biological children of Orenthal James Simpson and
Nicole Brown Simpson. On July, 27, 1994, just weeks after the death of
their mother and while their father was incarcerated, the minors were
made the subject of a voluntary guardianship with maternal
grandparents, Lou and Juditha Brown. On August 31, 1994, while still
incarcerated, Simpson nominated the Browns as guardians ``until such
time as (he was) able to resume his legal and physical custody of said
minor children.'' The parties further agreed that Simpson's release
from incarceration would trigger his right to seek termination of the
voluntary guardianship.

After 17 months, Simpson was released. After a brief transitional
period, when it became clear that the parties would not come to a
mutually agreeable arrangement for the children's custody, Simpson
filed a formal petition for termination of the guardianship. Within a
month, in January of 1995 the parties stipulated to the appointment of
a mutually agreed upon attorney to act as counsel for the minors.

For a period of approximately seven months, while the children
remained with the Browns and had regularly recurring visitation with
their father, the attorney for the minors conducted her investigation
and consulted with psychiatric and psychological experts. After
consulting with the parties, their extended family members, trusted
friends and neighbors, the children's therapist and after meeting with
the children, the children's attorney made a formal custody
recommendation to the parties.

Following this, the parties were unable to come to a mutually
agreeable resolution of the custody dispute and in the summer of 1996,
the matter returned to court where, over the course of 10 trial days,
evidence was taken before a probate commissioner. On September 17,
1996 those hearings terminated without a voluntary resolution of the
matter.

This Court was subsequently assigned the case for trial, which
commenced on November 12. At trial the Court took judicial notice of
all of the testimony and evidence from the prior 10 days of hearings.
At trial, this Court heard 14 additional days of testimony and
argument. The matter was submitted on December 11, 1996.

The Trial Evidence:

At trial, the Court had the benefit of testimony given by every
significant adult in the children's lives, including statements by
their mother before her death. In addition, the Court heard the expert
testimony of the children's therapist of two years. The therapist's
clinical observations and assessments were also shared freely and with
the consent of the parties with the child psychological and
psychiatric expert witnesses for all parties,including the
court-appointed experts under Section 730 Evidence Code. The Court
then heard the evaluations and opinions of these experts.

The Court also heard the testimony and received physical evidence
offered on the subject of several instances of domestic violence
allegedly committed by petitioner Simpson against his then wife and
later ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson. The Court heard expert testimony
on the profile of a batterer and risk factors relevant to children who
are effected, directly or indirectly, by battering conduct.

The Legal Standard:

The petition before the Court seeks to terminate the existing
guardianship with the grandparents, so as to restore the minors to
their father's custody. Family Law Section 3041 governs child custody
where a non-parent seeks to retain custody. It provides that
``(b)efore making an order granting custody to a person or persons
other than a parent... the court shall make a finding that granting
custody to a parent would be detrimental to the child...''

The Courts have explained that it is the ``occasional'' or ``rare''
case where custody is taken away and that a non-parent should be
awarded custody only in ``unusual and extreme cases''. See, In re B.G.
(1974) 11 C.3d 679, 698; In re Guardianship of Marino (1973) 30
Cal.App.3d 952.

Therefore, a custodial placement away from the parent must be
``essential to avert harm to the child.'' In re Rodrigo (1990) 225
Cal.App.3d 1179, 1185. As explained by the California Supreme Court in
In re B.G., ``(t)he intent of the Legislature is that the Court
consider parental custody to be highly preferable. Parental custody
must be clearly detrimental to the child before custody can be awarded
to a nonparent.'' Id. At 698. The typical reasons children have been
removed from parental custody are absence, inability to provide a
suitable home and necessities of life, neglect, cruelty, depravity or
physical abuse. See, In re B.G., supra.

At trial, the non-parent has burden of proving detriment by ``clear
and convincing'' evidence. Guardianship of Stephen G.(1995) 40
Cal.App.4th 1418, 1423-25. In the context of taking away a parent's
full custody of his/her child ``clear and convincing'' evidence has
been described as nothing less than evidence that is ``so clear as to
leave no substantial doubt. It must be sufficiently strong to command
the unhesitating assent of every reasonable mind.'' In re David C.
(1984) 152 Cal.App.3d 1189, 1208.

The Law Applied to the Facts:

It is undisputed that, up until 1994, for the majority of their lives,
the children resided with Simpson at the Rockingham residence. Even
after the 1992 divorce, the kids are reported to have occupied the
Rockingham residence as their primary home with their mother during a
portion of 1994. (UCCJA Declaration of Louis H. Brown, 7/27/94; Tr.
Exh. 3P). During the period of separation from Nicole, shared joint
legal custody and had open access to the children at all times of the
week. Simpson saw the children on a regular basis, from his residence,
only minutes away from their mother's residence. This frequent contact
was foreclosed during his 17 months of incarceration. However, Simpson
talked to the children on the average, twice weekly, and reunited with
them within 24 hours of release from jail.

From this history with their father, the children share a relationship
with their father that appears to be strong, positive, and healthy,
with powerful psychological bonding. All experts who had the benefit
of analyzing the children with all of their significant adults, came
to the same conclusion on this point.

At trial, the Browns addressed their burden by bringing evidence of
domestic violence allegedly committed by Simpson against Nicole Brown
Simpson. The Browns asked this Court to consider the mandate of Family
Code Section 3011(b) which requires the Court in making a best
interests custody determination to consider ``(a)ny history of abuse
by one parent against the child or against the other parent.''

It is unclear whether Section 3011 strictly applies to the case at
bar, where a threshold determination of detriment must be made.
However, this Court has accepted the position taken by the Browns and
their expert witnesses that a pattern of physically and emotionally
abusive behavior directed by one parent against the other can be
detrimental to the development of healthy children, even if the
children were ``not the direct targets of the abuse''. See, Heck v.
Reed (1995) 529 N.W.2d 155,162; In re Marriage of Brainard (1994) 523
N.W.2d 611, 615. For this reason, the National Council of Juvenile and
Family Court Judges has adopted a provision that recommends that the
court consider the issue of family violence whenever a child custody
matter is being considered. National Council of Juvenile and Family
Court Judges, Family Violence Project, Family Violence: Improving
Court Practice, 41 Juvenile and Family Court Journal, 19-20 (1990)

In applying these principles to this case, psychological testing,
clinical observations and review of Simpson's history with the
children does not yield a picture of a man who has in the past, or is
likely in the future to lose control of himself in such a manner as to
emotionally or physically harm his two young children.

Much discussion at trial centered on the issue of whether Simpson fits
the profile of a ``batterer'' and whether he has character flaws
likely to endanger the children's physical or emotional well being,
This Court heard evidence spanning the entire period during which
Nicole and O.J. Simpson were parents. This included evidence of verbal
and physical abuse in the relationship. The Court finds that the
relationship reached a fearful crescendo on January 1, 1989, when
Simpson was arrested and charged with domestic violence. Although
Simpson has admitted fault in the incident resulting in injuries to
Nicole, the Court does not find his admissions to be entirely
revealing. In this regard, the Court finds to be true testimony
concerning slapping incidents which occurred on at least three
separate occasions in the mid-80s, leading up to the New Years 1989
incident. Other testimony of sightings of puffiness on Nicole's face
or bruises on occasions after 1989 is not sufficiently clear that the
Court can tie those observations to any domestic violence. These
sightings are not supported by testimony of close family members of
Nicole who saw her on a regular basis during the period 1989-1994 and
saw no signs of physical trauma.

Likewise, Nicole's statements to dispatch and police officers at the
October 1993 incident, that violence had happened in the past, could
easily refer to the mid 80s to 1989 period which the Court has found
to be true. As to whether violence existed in the Brown-Simpson
relationship after that period, the record is less clear. In a
surreptitiously recorded police interview with Nicole at the October
1993 incident, she stated that she had not been beaten in four years.
This is consistent with other evidence indicating that the 1989
incident was the last time. At that time the children were 5 months
old and 3-and-a-half years old.

Since evidence of risk or harm to the children can be difficult to
ascertain the absence of evidence that they were ever exposed to
domestic violence, the Court has looked for guidance in the
evaluations of the child psychiatric and psychological witnesses who
have investigated the children for this case. The Court, in
considering the extensive documentation of two year psychological
treatment history of Sydney and Justin agrees with the findings of the
expert evaluators, that there is no clinical or psychological evidence
that Simpson has ever emotionally or psychologically abused the
children in or out of the context of any battering relationship. It is
also the finding of this Court that Simpson has never physically
abused the children. Some of the most compelling evidence on this
vital point comes from the undisputed observations of experts and eye
witnesses alike, that the kids exhibit no covert signs of fear or
intimidation around their father and that they express affection for
him are comforted in his presence.

As evidence of the children's lack of fear of their father, at least
one child has expressed an unequivocal preference to be returned to
the immediate custody of father. The other child has declined to state
a preference to the court-appointed psychologist, but has stated in
positive tones, the strong bonds that child has with father's
neighborhood and the child's friends. The experts have agreed that
strong peer relationship are a key factor in aiding a child recovering
from losses. The children's comfort level with their father is further
revealed in their willingness to chide and tease him and even
challenge him, without fear of inappropriate consequences.

The Civil ``Wrongful Death'' Case:

Inherent in this case, has been the suggestion by some parties, that
evidence or future verdicts given in the concurrent civil proceeding
against Simpson be considered by this Court. It is suggested that the
subject matter of the case involves issues of Simpson's conduct that
may be pertinent to the minor's interests herein. As to evidence, this
Court has in fact heard some of the same witnesses who have testified
on identical subjects in the civil trial. In some cases those dual
testimonies have taken place within 24 hours of each other. The Court
has considered such testimony as was received in the custody trail.
The Court did not receive any evidence in the custody trial concerning
allegations of murder by Simpson. That being the case, it would be
improper to speculate as to the effect that such evidence would have
on the ultimate result in the custody case.

However, during the custody trial, the parties and Court contemplated
the effect if any, of the civil case verdicts, should the custody case
have been delayed. The Court's research has indicated that any verdict
rendered by the civil jury would not be binding in the custody
proceeding for a number of reasons. First, the civil burden of
preponderance of the evidence is a lessor burden of proof than that in
the custody case, which requires clear and convincing evidence.

Further, even assuming that one could identify identical parties or
party representatives in the two cases, and assuming a jury verdict
were returned, neither the doctrine of res judicata or the related
doctrine of collateral estoppel would operate until the civil judgment
is final. Witkin, California Procedure, Volume 7, Section 194(a)
(1985). Appeals would take years. Thus, without actually hearing the
evidence produced in another proceeding, this Court is unable to
utilize any procedural device to import the civil case evidence into
the custody case determination.

This raises the issue of whether this Court should have granted a
mid-trial request by respondents that this Court do whatever has to be
done procedurally, to allow the homicide case to be put on in the
custody trial. This request came weeks after the respondents had
submitted a witness list of 42 individuals and an exhibit book, none
of which contained any of the homicide witnesses or evidence. The
request came after all counsel has completed trial preparation,
submitted witness lists and after all of the appointed and retained
experts had completed their evaluations and submitted their results.

The request was denied by the Court as untimely. The Court concluded
that after 11 months of pretrial delay and in consideration of the
considerable risk to the children of further damaging publicity that
would accompany an unprecedented third ``homicide trial'' of Mr.
Simpson, that terminating the custody case and continuing it
indefinitely so that this matter could be re-tooled into a homicide
trial, would be not in the best interest of the children.

Grandparent Visitation:

All experts who have considered the relationships of these children
with the Browns, have agreed that it is in the children's's best
interests to have continuing and meaningful periods of time with the
Browns and the extended family connected with the children, including
their aunts, cousins and neighborhood friends in Orange County. Mr.
Simpson has also taken this position. Under Family Code Section 3102,
when a parent is deceased, the Court has the power to grant reasonable
visitation to grandparents, if it would be in the best interest of the
children. This Court has so found. Accordingly, the Court orders
continuing visitation between the children and the Browns. The Court
concurs with the recommendation of the Court's expert evaluators, that
there be periodic weekend visits, coupled with some splitting of
school holiday and vacation periods. The parties shall meet and confer
as soon as possible, through a mutually trusted intermediary, to
design a specific visitation plan for weekend, holiday and vacation
arrangements for the benefit of the children. The Court will retain
jurisdiction over visitation.

Statement of Decision

The Clerk is ordered to serve a copy of this order upon the parties.
Pursuant to Rule 232(a) of the California Rules of Court, this
decision shall be the statement of decision, unless within ten days
any party files further requests.

SO ORDERED: this 20th Day of December, 1996

Nancy Wieben Stock, Judge

The Brown Family fought long and hard against Mr. Simpson's petition
to regain the custody of Sydney and Justin in order to assure that
these children would be safe and protected and not exposed to the
risks and detriment of domestic violence which plagued their past and,
if returned to Mr. Simpson, would be likely to affect their future.

It is with great sadness and concern threat we received the news today
that the judge has decided to terminate the guardianship.

We love Sydney and Justin and pray for their safety and well-being as
they return to their father.

-The Brown Family.

"We would like to thank Lou and Juditha Brown for doing the best they

<B>LANGE:</B> Yeah?<P>

<B>SIMPSON:</B> We went to that house. It was all in shambles. I had just bought it. But that's where we went.<P>

<B>LANGE:</B> Okay.<P>

The plaintiffs claim that Simpson has produced no evidence to back up his "wild,  
desperate assertion" that incriminating evidence was planted. "In the criminal trial,  
Simpson was given unfettered reign to advance his unsubstantiated claims of police  
conspiracy . . . presumably to afford him the widest possible discretion to raise doubts in  
the face of a double murder prosecution against him. We are now in a civil case, however,  
and the rules are different," Fredric Goldman's lawyer Daniel Petrocelli states in this Aug.  
26, 1996 pretrial motion. "Evidence that creates only a 'reasonable doubt' is  
insufficient."</P>

MOTION IN LIMINE OF PLAINTIFF  
FREDRIC GOLDMAN TO PRECLUDE  
ARGUMENT AND QUESTIONING  
REGARDING PLANTING OF  
EVIDENCE  
  
Trial Date: September 17, 1996  
  
  
GOLDMAN MOTION NO. 1  
  
  
  
Defendant Orenthal James Simpson would like to explain away the overwhelming  
amount of incriminating evidence against him by claiming that the Los Angeles Police  
Department planted the evidence in a massive conspiracy to frame him for a double   
murder. Despite two years of extraordinary investigation and discovery by teams of  
defense lawyers, experts, and investigators, Simpson has produced no evidence to back  
up his wild, desperate assertion.  
  
In the criminal trial, Simpson was given unfettered reign to advance his unsubstantiated  
claims of police conspiracy and planting of evidence, presumably to afford him the  
widest possible discretion to raise doubts in the face of a double murder prosecution  
against him. We are now in a civil case, however, and the rules are different. Evidence  
that at best creates only a "reasonable doubt" is insufficient.  
  
Goldman contends that Simpson attacked and killed Ronald Goldman, and Simpson  
denies these acts. Goldman bears the burden of proof on this issue. But Simpson goes one  
crucial step beyond mere denial. He affirmatively asserts that the police conspired and  
planted evidence against him. On this claim, Simpson bears the burden of proof.  
Evidence Code  664 states: "It is presumed that official duty has been regularly  
performed." Evid. Code  664. This presumption applies generally to police officers.  
Davenport v. Dept. of Motor Vehicles, 6 Cal. App. 4th 133, 141 (1992), overruled on  
other grounds, McNary v. Dept. of Motor Vehicles, 45 Cal. App. 4th 688 (1996). See also  
People v. Harris, 213 Cal. App. 2d 365, 369 (1963) (where defendant claimed police  
entrapped him, he had burden of proof on that issue and "in the void of specific testimony  
. . . the courts cannot infer improper motives or activities on the part of the officers, but  
must presume that the officers regularly and lawfully performed their duties"). Section  
664 is a presumption affecting the burden of proof, Evid. Code  660, the effect of which  
"is to impose upon the party against whom it operates the burden of proof as to the  
nonexistence of the presumed fact." Evid. Code  606; see also Evid. Code  500,  
550.Simpson cannot possibly meet this burden because he does not even have sufficient  
evidence to sustain a jury finding -- that he was framed. In response to Goldman's specific  
interrogatories and requests for admissions, Simpson was required in this case to disclose  
all of his evidence showing that blood and other evidence were planted against him. After  
Simpson objected and flatly refused to answer these discovery requests, Goldman sought  
and obtained an order from the court compelling answers. But Simpson's court-ordered  
answers were vague, evasive, and little more than broad and indiscriminate references to  
over one year of protracted proceedings in the criminal trial, including grand jury  
proceedings, the preliminary hearing, pretrial proceedings, and the nine-month long jury  
trial. Consequently, Goldman has filed a motion for preclusion sanctions to be heard by  
this court on September 17. The simple fact is that Simpson has had many months to  
provide the evidence supporting his claims, he has not been able to do so, and he cannot  
do so at trial. See Thoren v. Lohnson and Washer, 29 Cal. App. 3d 270, 274 (1972) (party  
may not rely on evidence not disclosed during discovery in response to interrogatories).  
  
Entirely absent from Simpson's interrogatory answers is any concrete evidence of  
planting of blood or other evidence against him. Simpson does not identify a single  
person who planted the evidence. He does not state when the evidence was planted. He  
does not explain how the evidence was planted. He does not say why the evidence was  
planted. Without such basic foundational facts, all that remains is rank speculation and  
pure conjecture. The court should not permit this trial to be diverted down such paths. See  
People v. Kaurish, 52 Cal. 3d 648, 685 (1990) (even in a criminal case where defendant  
need create only a reasonable doubt of his guilt, court properly granted prosecution's  
motion in limine to prohibit questioning about a third party's involvement in the crime,  
because "evidence of mere motive or opportunity" to act by the third party is not  
sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt; defendant must provide "direct or circumstantial  
evidence linking the third person to the actual" commission of the act).  
  
No reasonable jury could find that any item of evidence-was planted - -based on the  
evidence on which Simpson relies -- nonexistent in some cases, scant in others.  
Questioning and argument that evidence was planted could serve only to confuse the  
issues, mislead the jury, consume undue time, and unduly prejudice plaintiffs, and should  
be excluded. Evid. Code  352.  
  
The recent case of People v. Ponce, 44 Cal. App. 4th 1380 (1996), illuminates this  
principle. In Ponce, the defendant in a robbery case sought to argue that he had been  
framed by the Los Angeles Police Department. The trial court ruled that there was  
insufficient evidence to permit the defense to argue such a "framing" theory,  
notwithstanding the defendant's contention that he was entitled to argue his theory of the  
case to the jury. On appeal, the trial court's decision was upheld because "there was no  
substantial evidence of an effort by a single police officer to falsely accuse or assist a  
witness in inaccurately identifying defendant as the perpetrator of the offense" or "that  
two or more police officers entered into what amounted to a conspiracy to obstruct justice  
by falsely accusing defendants of the crimes which resulted in convictions. The fact that  
defendants were contending they had been misidentified or there was a reasonable doubt  
as to guilt was not substantial evidence of Misconduct by law enforcement officials  
amounting to an effort to 'frame' [defendants]. The reality that there were inconsistencies  
in [the victim's] testimony or that of the officers did not amount to substantial evidence of  
an attempt by police officers, individually or collectively, to falsely accuse defendants of  
the robbery. In the absence of such evidence, the trial court had a duty and right to  
preclude defense counsel from pursuing such argument.... Trial judges have the duty to  
responsibly and fairly control the proceedings to prohibit argument which   
is not supported by substantial evidence. " 44 Cal. App. 4th at 1389-90 (emphasis added).  
  
Simpson claims all of the most incriminating pieces of evidence were planted: (1) the  
trail of Simpson's blood at Bundy; (2) Simpson's blood on the back gate at Bundy; (3)  
Simpson's blood, Ronald Goldman's blood, and Nicole Brown Simpson's blood in  
Simpson's Bronco; (4) a glove containing Simpson's blood, Ron's blood, Nicole's blood,  
Ron's hair, Nicole's hair, fibers from Ron's shirt, fibers from Ron's pants, and fibers from  
Simpson's Bronco, at Simpson's residence on Rockingham; (5) Simpson's blood inside  
and outside of his home on Rockingham; and (6) Simpson's blood and Nicole's blood on  
Simpson's socks in his bedroom. As to certain of these items of evidence, Simpson's  
interrogatory answers offer no explanation to show planting; as to others, the answers  
posit circumstances Simpson contends are suspicious and support an inference of  
planting. For the Court's convenience, the relevant interrogatory answers are quoted and  
summarized in the Declaration of Daniel M. Petrocelli filed concurrently herewith.  
Examination of the interrogatory answers shows that no jury could reasonably infer  
planting of evidence from the facts advanced by Simpson. Nowhere has Simpson recited  
who planted the evidence, when it was planted, how it was planted, or why it was planted.  
  
One example illustrates the merit of this motion. On June 13, the police found   
and collected blood drops to the left of bloody shoe prints at the Bundy crime scene  
leading away from the victims towards the back gate. The undisputed evidence in this  
case is that these blood drops were collected by LAPD criminalists on June 13 before  
Simpson gave a sample of his blood to the police at Parker Center in the late afternoon of  
the same day. The blood drops were tested and matched Simpson's blood. In response to  
Goldman's Requests for Admissions, Simpson admitted that the blood tested matched his  
blood. To overcome this conclusive evidence of guilt, Simpson claims his blood was  
planted in place of the real killer's blood. When asked to explain how the Bundy blood  
drops, collected before the police obtained Simpson's blood, could be planted, Simpson  
merely referred to the entire closing argument of Johnnie Cochran and Barry Scheck, plus  
thousands of other pages of the criminal trial, the preliminary hearing, the Griffin hearing,  
and depositions in this case -- all in the transparent hope of hiding his complete absence  
of evidence or explanation.  
  
In banning cameras from the courtroom and issuing an order limiting public discussion of  
this case, the Court drew heavily on the lessons learned from the criminal trial. Another  
of those vital lessons is the absolute need to prevent the confusion, prejudice, and waste  
of the court and jury's time resulting from questioning, testimony, and argument about  
speculative theories lacking any basis in fact.  
  
Accordingly, Goldman urges the Court to prevent defendant from misleading the jury,  
confusing the issue, creating undue prejudice, and consuming. inordinate amounts of time  
by entering an order prohibiting Simpson from questioning any witnesses and arguing to  
the jury that any of the evidence in this case was planted. In the alternative, if the Court is  
not inclined to grant this motion, Goldman asks the Court to consider the six motions  
filed herewith that separately address each category of evidence Simpson claims was  
planted.

The LAPD collected blood drops at O.J. Simpson's Rockingham estate and found that the 
blood match Simpson's blood, the plaintiffs contend. In this motion filed Aug. 26, 1996, 
the Goldman family asks the judge to prohibit the defense from advancing its theory that 
blood collected from Rockingham was planted in a conspiracy to frame Simpson, arguing 
that "the undisputed evidence -- that the vial of Simpson's blood evidence had been 
collected -- renders any such speculative theory logically impossible."</P>

MOTION IN LIMINE TO PRECLUDE 
ARGUMENT AND QUESTIONING 
REGARDING PLANTING OF

Trial Date: September 17, 1996 
 
GOLDMAN MOTION NO. 3 
 
As an alternative to his Motion in limine to Preclude Argument and Questioning 
Regarding Planting of Evidence (the "Planting Motion"), which seeks to preclude 
argument and questioning regarding planting of all evidence in this case, plaintiff Fredric 
Goldman submits this motion. 
 
The Los Angeles Police Department designated as evidence item numbers 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 
12, and 14 the blood drops collected at the Rockingham estate of defendant Orenthal 
James Simpson. Testing established that this blood matched Simpson's blood. By this 
motion, Goldman asks this Court to enter an order precluding Simpson from presenting 
argument or questioning at trial to support his speculative contention the blood collected 
from Simpson's Rockingham estate was planted in an effort to frame Simpson for the 
murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman. 
 
As set forth in the Planting Motion, Simpson will have the burden of proof in this case to 
establish by a preponderance of the evidence that each  particular item of evidence was 
planted. Evid. Code 606, 660, 664. As also discussed in the Planting Motion, Simpson 
may not question witnesses or present argument regarding his planting theory unless he 
can present both "substantial evidence" that the particular item of evidence was planted 
and "direct or circumstantial evidence linking" a particular person to the planting of the 
evidence; evidence showing merely that a third person had a "motive or opportunity" to 
commit the act is not sufficient. People v. Ponce, 44 Cal. App. 4th 1380, 1389-90 (1996); 
People v. Kaurish, 52 Cal. 3d 648, 685 (1990). 
 
Simpson's evidence, as revealed by his interrogatory responses, is such that no reasonable 
jury could find that Simpson has met his burden of proof on this issue. In special 
interrogatories, Goldman asked Simpson if he contended that certain  of these blood 
drops (LAPD evidence items-6, 7,12, and 14) consisted, in whole or in part, of planted 
evidence, and, if so, to state all facts that supported this contention. After initially 
refusing to respond to these interrogatories, Simpson was ordered to do so by Judge 
Haber on June 25. At the June 25 hearing, Judge Haber made clear that, if Simpson 
elected to respond by simply referring to other documents such as criminal trial 
transcripts, he would be required to cite to the specific pages and lines of such documents 
where the facts on which his contention was based could be found. 
 
In direct contravention of Judge Haber's order, Simpson responded to these 
interrogatories by "referring" Goldman to the entire closing argument of Johnnie Cochran 
and Barry Scheck from Simpson's murder trial; (2) the entire grand jury testimony of six 
different witnesses, the entire preliminary hearing testimony of eight different witnesses, 
the entire Griffin hearing testimony of six different witnesses, the entire testimony of 
seven different witnesses from the hearing on Simpson's motion to suppress evidence; the 
entire testimony of 40 different witnesses at the murder trial, and all of the deposition 
testimony taken in this case of any of the foregoing witnesses and of Gary Siglar./2 See 
Declaration of Daniel M. Petrocelli (filed concurrently herewith) Paragraph 3. 
 
Simpson's responses do not cite to a single fact or piece of evidence upon which Simpson 
bases his contention that these items were planted. The reason for this is plain: Simpson 
has no evidence, and certainly no substantial evidence, that these items were planted. His 
attempt to hide this complete absence of evidence behind purported citations to the 
voluminous testimony of dozens of witnesses is transparent.3 
 
Indeed, three basic, undisputed facts render meritless any possible claim that  the 
Rockingham blood drops were planted. (1) It is undisputed that the only even theoretical  
source of planted Simpson blood was the blood sample Simpson provided to the LAPD 
on  June 13, 1994. (2) It is undisputed that Detective Phillip Vannatter promptly took 
possession of the vial containing this blood sample, and, at approximately 5:20 p.m., 
arrived at Rockingham and gave the vial to criminalist Dennis Fung to be booked. By the 
time Vannatter arrived at Rockingham with the vial, all of the Rockingham blood drops 
had already been collected. See Criminal Trial Testimony of Phillip Vannatter 19367:18-
19372:4; Criminal Trial Testimony of Dennis Fung 21579:6- 21583:9. (3) It is 
undisputed that there is not a single witness that has testified, could testify, or will testify 
that any planting of Simpson's blood occurred at the LAPD's Special Investigations 
Division laboratory, or at any other laboratory where the Rockingham blood drops were 
examined or tested. 
 
In short, Simpson has no evidence that the Rockingham blood was planted. Any such 
argument could only be based entirely on rank speculation. Indeed, the undisputed 
evidence -- that the vial of Simpson's blood was taken to Rockingham only after all of the  
Rockingham blood evidence had been collected -- renders any such speculative theory 
logically impossible. Simpson cannot be permitted to unnecessarily prolong the trial, 
confuse the issues, and mislead the jury with argument that the Rockingham blood was 
planted, with evidence of trivial inconsistencies in testimony or on collateral matters, or 
with evidence that Simpson has refused to disclose to plantiffs in response to specific 
interrogatories. Ponce supra; Evid. Code 352 ("court may  exclude evidence if its 
probative value is substantially outweighted bythe probability that its admission will (a) 
necessitate undue consumption of times or (b) create substantial danger of undue 
prejudice, of confusing the issues, or of misleading the jury.") Thoren v. Johnson and 
Washer, 29 Cal. App. 3d 270, 274 (1972) (party may not rely on evidence not disclosed 
during discovery in response to interrogatories).

FOOTNOTES 
1 This motion is addressed to blood found outside Simpson's house, on the floor of his 
master bedroom, and on the floor of his foyer. It is not addressed to blood found on items 
of clothing found in his house, such as the socks taken from his bedroom. 
 
2 Simpson's response to Interrogatory No. 44, which is incorporated by reference into his 
responses to Interrogatory Nos. 47, 50, and 62, also refers Goldman to Simpson's own 
deposition testimony in which he purportedly "gave answers concerning explanations of 
how his blood might be found at his own house." Of course, Simpson's claim that he may 
have bled at his house refutes, rather than supports, his theory that some third party 
planted his blood there. 
 
3 Goldman has previously filed a motion seeking issue and evidentiary sanctions against 
Simpson for his failure to comply with Judge Haber's Order to provide further responses 
to Goldman's first set of special interrogatories. This motion is addressed to a different, if 
related, issue: Even if this Court does not impose such sanctions, Simpson's inability to 
cite to any substantial evidence that the blood collected from his Rockingham estate was 
planted affords an independent basis on which to preclude Simpson from making any 
such argument.

MOTION IN LIMINE TO PRECLUDE   
ARGUMENT AND QUESTIONING   
REGARDING PLANTING OF   
EVIDENCE]  
  
  
GOLDMAN MOTION NO. 4  
  
  
  
As an alternative to his Motion in Limine to Preclude Argument and Questioning  
Regarding Planting of Evidence (the "Planting Motion"), which seeks to preclude  
argument and questioning regarding planting of all evidence in this case, plaintiff Fredric  
Goldman submits this motion.  
  
A leather glove found at defendant Orenthal James Simpson's Rockingham estate a few  
hours after the bodies of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman were found at  
Nicole's home on Bundy Drive matched a glove found at the Bundy crime scene. The  
"Rockingham glove" contained the blood of Simpson, Nicole, and Ron, hair from Ron  
and Nicole, fibers from Ron's pants and shirt, and fibers from Simpson's Bronco. By this  
motion, Goldman asks this Court to enter an order precluding Simpson from presenting  
argument and questioning witnesses at trial to support his speculative contention that this  
glove was "planted," i.e., left where it was found by someone other than Simpson. 
  
As set forth in the Planting Motion, Simpson will have the burden of proof in this case to  
establish by a preponderance of the evidence that each particular item of evidence was  
planted. Evid. Code 606, 660, 664. As also discussed in the Planting Motion, Simpson  
may not question witnesses or present argument regarding his planting theory unless he  
can present both "substantial evidence" that the particular item of evidence was planted  
and "direct or circumstantial evidence linking" a particular person to the planting of the  
evidence; evidence showing merely that a third person had a "motive or opportunity" to  
commit the act is not sufficient. People v. Ponce, 44 Cal. App. 4th 1380, 1389-90 (1996);  
People v. Kaurish, 52 Cal. 3d 648, 685 (1990).  
  
Simpson's evidence, as revealed by his interrogatory responses, is such that no reasonable  
jury could find that Simpson has met his burden of proof on this issue. See Declaration of  
Daniel M. Petrocelli (filed concurrently herewith) Paragraph 7. Despite the presence of  
dozens of investigators, including police officers, criminalists, photographers, and  
members of the media-and general public at the crime scene, and despite exhaustive  
investigations of this crime by Simpson, the LAPD, and numerous members of the media  
for over two years, there exists not one person who can confirm even a single element of  
Simpson's outlandish planting theory: that Fuhrman, without knowing whether Simpson  
had an alibi, whose blood was at the scene scene, or whether any other suspect existed,  
(1) found a second glove at Bundy that had escaped detection by any other person; (2)  
removed the glove without detection by anyone; (3) planted Simpson's blood on the  
glove, even though he had no possible way of obtaining any of Simpson's blood at that  
time; and (4) somehow hid the glove, travelled to Rockingham, and planted the glove  
there, again without detection from anyone, and without knowing whether the spot he  
chose to plant the glove had already been inspected by Kato Kaelin or anyone else.  
Simpson must argue that Fuhrman did this knowing that his actions subjected him to the  
death penalty for planting evidence of a capital crime.  
  
Instead, Simpson's response to Interrogatory No. 71 relies on speculation and conjecture,  
stating five equivocal "facts" that constitute the only support for Simpson's glove- 
planting theory. These "facts" are entirely neutral, and have no tendency in reason to  
suggest any improper conduct by anyone. These "facts" are plainly insufficient to permit  
Simpson to argue to the jury that the glove was planted.  
  
1. "[T]here was no blood trail leading to where [the glove] was found." This is probative  
of nothing, because there is no evidence to suggest that there would have been such a trail  
if Simpson dropped the glove. 
  
2. The glove "appeared to be moist when it was found in the morning." This is probative  
of nothing, because there is no evidence to suggest that the glove would not have been  
moist if it was left by Simpson the previous night. Moreover, this contention ignores the  
undisputed fact that tests showed that the surface | of the glove contained the blood of  
Nicole, Ron, and Simpson. Fuhrman could not possibly have placed Simpson's blood  
there, because Simpson did not give a blood sample until the afternoon of June 13 -- after  
the glove had been collected by criminalists. Simpson has no evidence -- only wild,  
unsupported speculation - that some unspecified person added Simpson's blood to the  
glove after it was booked into evidence but before it was subjected to any testing.  
  
3. The glove "did not have any dirt, plant materials, cobwebs, or other indicia that it had  
been at that location for a lengthy period of time." Again, Simpson offers no evidence  
that the glove would have been covered with dirt, cobwebs, or "plant materials" if he had  
dropped it the night before. 
  
4. "There was no evidence of blood on the ground under the glove." Again, this evidence  
has no probative value, because Simpson offers no evidence that there would have been  
blood on the ground under the glove if Simpson had dropped it the night before.  
  
5. "There was no evidence that anyone could have or did climb over the fence in the area  
where the item was found." Simpson does not explain what such "evidence" would be or  
why it would exist if Simpson had killed Ron and Nicole. The asserted lack of such  
evidence does not tend in reason to prove that the glove was planted. --   
  
Based on the paucity of evidence Simpson has offered, no reasonable jury could find the  
glove was planted. In the face of the utter absurdity of his theory, Simpson's scintilla of  
equivocal "evidence" is not sufficient to create a factual issue as to whether Fuhrman  
planted the glove, and can serve only to confuse and mislead the jury. Evid. Code  
352 (court may exclude evidence "if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the

1. Simpson's interrogatory responses also purport to incorporate by reference the entire  
closing argument of Johnnie Cochran and Barry Scheck from Simpson's murder trial, and  
to the entire testimony of dozens of witnesses at Simpson's murder trial, grand jury  
hearing, preliminary hearing, Griffin hearing, the hearing on Simpson's motion to  
suppress evidence, and to all of the deposition testimony taken in this case of any of the  
foregoing witnesses and of Gary Siglar. Obviously, little, if any, of this voluminous  
testimony supports Simpson's claim that the glove was planted, and Simpson's effort to  
hide his lack of evidence through "references" to thousands of pages of testimony is  
transparent.

Since "no reasonable jury could find that Simpson has met burden of proof" to establish  
that blood evidence was planted, the only purpose presenting such evidence could serve is  
to "unnecessarily prolong the trial, confuse the issues, and mislead,"  the jury with  
argument that the...Bronco blood...was planted," Daniel Petrocelli, attorney for Fredric  
Goldman, states in this Aug. 26, 1996 pretrial motion.</P>

REGARDING PLANTING OF

Trial Date: September 17, 1996  
  
GOLDMAN MOTION NO. 5  
  
As an alternative to his Motion in Limine to Preclude Argument and  Questioning  
Regarding Planting of Evidence (the "Planting Motion"), which seeks to preclude  
argument and questioning regarding planting of all evidence in this case, plaintiff Fredric  
Goldman submits this motion.  
  
By this motion, Goldman asks this Court to enter an Order precluding defendant Orenthal  
James Simpson from presenting argument or questioning witnesses at trial to support his  
speculative contention that the blood collected from Simpson's Bronco on June 14, 1994  
and September 1, 1994 was planted. On June 14, 1994, an LAPD criminalist collected  
blood samples from the Bronco, including those designated as LAPD evidence item  
numbers 23, 24, 25, 29, 30, 31, and 34. Subsequent tests revealed the presence of  
Simpson's blood, Ron Goldman's blood, and Nicole Brown Simpson's blood. On  
September 1, 1994, another LAPD criminalist collected additional blood from the  
Bronco, including LAPD evidence item numbers 293, 303, 304, and 305. Subsequent  
tests confirmed the results of the earlier tests.  
  
As set forth in the Planting Motion, Simpson will have the burden of proof in this case to  
establish by a preponderance of the evidence that each particular item of evidence was  
planted. Evid. Code 606, 660, 664. As also discussed in the Planting Motion' Simpson  
may not-question witnesses or present argument regarding his planting theory unless he  
can present both "substantial evidence" that the particular item of evidence was planted  
and "direct or circumstantial evidence linking" a particular person to the planting of the  
evidence; evidence showing merely that a third person had a "motive or opportunity" to  
commit the act is not sufficient. People v. Ponce. 44 Cal. App. 4th 1380, 1389-90 (1996);  
People v. Kaurish, 52 Cal. 3d 648, 685 (1990).  
  
Simpson's evidence, as revealed by his interrogatory responses, is such that no reasonable  
jury could find that Simpson has met his burden of proof on this issue. In response to  
special interrogatories propounded by Goldman inquiring about the basis of Simpson's  
contentions that the blood samples collected on June 14, 1994 were planted, Simpson said  
only that the Bronco "was kept in the street for any members of the media or bystanders  
could have access to it." See Declaration of Daniel M. Petrocelli (filed concurrently  
herewith) Paragraph 5./1 This is hardly probative of blood being planted in the Bronco.  
Presumably, no members of the public or media were carrying blood vials around with  
them containing the blood of Simpson, Ron, and Nicole.  
  
Indeed, three basic, undisputed facts render meritless any possible claim that Simpson's  
blood was planted in the Bronco. (1) It is undisputed that the only even theoretical source  
of planted Simpson blood was the blood sample Simpson provided to the LAPD on June  
13, 1994. (2) It is undisputed that Detective Phillip Vannatter promptly took possession  
of the vial containing this blood sample, and, at approximately 5:20 p.m., arrived at  
Rockingham and gave the vial to criminologist Dennis Fung to be booked. By this time,  
the Bronco had already been towed away. See Criminal Trial Testimony of Phillip  
Vannatter 19367:18-19372:4; Criminal Trial Testimony of Dennis Fung 21579:6- 
21583:9. (3) It is undisputed that there is not a single witness that has testified, could  
testify, or will testify that any planting of Simpson's blood occurred at the LAPD's  
Special Investigations Division laboratory, or at any other place where the Bronco blood  
evidence was examined or tested.  
  
In short, Simpson has no evidence that the Bronco blood collected on June 14, 1994 was  
planted. Simpson cannot be permitted to unnecessarily prolong the trial,confuse the  
issues, and mislead the jury with argument that the highly incriminating Bronco blood  
collected on June 14, 1994, was planted, with evidence of trivial inconsistencies in  
testimony or on collateral matters, or with evidence that Simpson has refused to disclose  
to plaintiffs in response to specific interrogatories. Ponce, supra: Evid. Code  352 (court  
may exclude evidence "if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the  
probability that its admission will (a) necessitate undue consumption of time or (b) create  
substantial danger of undue prejudice, of confusing the issues, or of misleading the  
jury."); Thoren v. Johnson and Washer, 29 Cal. App. 3d 270, 274 (1972) (party may not  
rely on evidence not disclosed during discovery in response to interrogatories).  
  
In addition, Simpson should be prohibited from arguing that the additional Bronco blood  
collected on September 1, 1994 was planted. Once again, Simpson has no evidence  
showing who planted the evidence, how it was planted, when it was planted, or why it  
was planted. Significantly, the tests conducted on these samples yielded results that  
paralleled the results of the tests conducted on the evidence removed from the Bronco on  
June 14, including blood taken from the same locations such as the Bronco's center  
console.  
  
Simpson's only additional "evidence" that this blood was planted, as disclosed by his  
interrogatory responses, is that "between June 13 and August 2, when Item No. 293 was  
collected, the Ford Bronco was kept in an unsecured facility with access by many  
different people both in law enforcement and out of law enforcement. In fact, the Bronco  
was examined by William Blasini, Jr. during that period of time (RT 43971,1). Mr.  
Blasini is specifically trained to look for such things as stains inside a car. He saw no  
stains consistent with blood." No reasonable jury could conclude that evidence was  
planted merely because unidentified people had "access" to the car, absent evidence that  
any of those people actually planted evidence. Kaurish, supra (evidence that a person had  
motive or opportunity to commit an act is insufficient to prove that person committed the  
act). Similarly, absent evidence that Blasini actually looked at the places in the Bronco  
where blood was later found and saw no blood, and that he would have seen the blood if  
he had looked, his testimony is of no probative value.  
  
Once again, Simpson relies entirely on speculation, conjecture, and unreasonable  
inferences. He presents no evidence to show who planted the evidence, when it was  
planted, how it was planted, or why it was planted. In short, because Simpson has no  
substantial evidence that these samples were planted, argument and questioning regarding  
any such contention will only unnecessarily consume time, confuse the issues, and  
mislead the jury. Evid. Code  352.

FOOTNOTES  
1. Simpson's interrogatory response also makes the unsupported claim that the Bronco  
was towed to an unspecified "unsecured facility" prior to the collection of this evidence  
by Fung, but this claim is supported by no facts and is directly contradicted by the  
undisputed testimony of tow truck driver Bernie Douroux and criminalist Dennis Fung  
that the print shed was locked and secured from the time Douroux left the Bronco there to  
the time Fung unlocked the shed and collected the evidence.

Simpson responded to each with the response, "Possibly."'With respect to each of the above interrogatories, Goldman propounded a follow-up interrogatory asking Simpson to "please set forth in detail all facts that support your contention." [Interrogatory Nos. 176,179, and 182.] Simpson responded by citing the following "facts":* "Defendant has received anonymous phone calls that Faye Resnick may have maintained drug debts and said anonymous callers have informed representatives of the defendants that the crimes committed on June 12, 1994 was related to the drug debts incurred by Ms. Resnick. Defendant has no further information that either substantiates or denies said anonymous claims."* "Per the police report, Sidney [sic] Simpson heard her mother crying on the phone. Faye Resnick spoke with Nicole on the phone that night."The interrogatory responses also referred Goldman to unspecified portions of  Simpson's deposition. At his deposition, Simpson was asked about the basis for his belief "that the answer to these murders are in the world of Faye Resnick." He responded: * "[S]he's lied about every -- so much, I should say, since this thing is over, and I can't believe that a person would lie the way she has for no reason. She claimed her life was in danger early on, which I guess it was, and she claims her life is in danger now. Certainly not from me, but I wouldn't be surprised . . . I thought, the bizarre way Nicole was acting seemed to somehow be related to Faye Resnick." Deposition of Orenthal James Simpson 1982:121983:9.* Simpson also admitted at his deposition that no one has ever told him that the murders had anything to do with Faye Resnick. Simpson Depo. 1983:17-25.The purpose of a motion in limine is to "avoid the prejudicial effect of questions asked or statements made in connection with the offer of objectionable evidence." B. Witkin, 3 California Evidence (3d ed. 1986)  2011, at 1969; see also Ganey v. Doran. 191 Cal. App. 3d 901 (1987) (trial court correctly precluded counsel from referring to agreement as "illegal" where there was no evidence of illegality).Simpson may not introduce evidence or raise factual contentions at trial that he failed to disclose in response to interrogatories specifically directed to those contentions. Thoren v. Johnson and Washer, 29 Cal. App. 3d 270, 274-75 (1972) (party is bound by interrogatory answer where failure to provide information "subjects the adversary to unfair surprise at trial" or "deprives his adversary of the opportunity of preparation"). Here, the only "facts" that Simpson identifies as supporting his claim that the "world of Faye Resnick" is responsible for the murders either constitutes inadmissible opinion and hearsay (purported anonymous telephone calls received by Simpson, and allegations that Resnick has said her life is in danger), or is irrelevant to any claim that Resnick or her "world" had something to do with the murders. Even if Simpson could prove that Resnick used drugs or lied about some unspecified matter, this would not tend to prove that the murders are connected to her or her "world." Similarly, the claim that Simpson's daughter heard Nicole crying while talking on the telephone on the evening of June 12, and that Nicole spoke to Faye Resnick on the telephone that night, is not evidence that the murders are connected to Resnick or her "world."Simpson obviously has no evidence that Ms. Resnick or her "world" had anything whatsoever to do with these murders. He should not be permitted to confuse the issues and mislead the jury by presenting arguments to the jury unsupported by substantial evidence and based on pure speculation. People v. Ponce, 44 Cal. App. 4th 1380,1390 (1996) ("Trial judges have the duty to responsibly and fairly control the proceedings to prohibit argument which is not supported by substantial evidence."); see also Evid. Code 352 (Court may exclude evidence "if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the probability that its admission will . . . create substantial danger of uR o o t   E n t r y                                                   	           F     'j

In the video released earlier this year by defendant Orenthal James Simpson, Simpson asserted that the identity of the killer or killers of Nicole and Ron could be found in the "world of Faye Resnick." In response to an interrogatory propounded by plaintiff Fredric Goldman, Simpson asserted that the murders were "possibly" related in some way to Faye Resnick. Simpson has now had an opportunity to discover and investigate this claim for over two years. However, his interrogatory responses demonstrate that he has no evidence, let alone any admissible evidence, that in any way ties Faye Resnick or her "world" to the murders. Simpson should be precluded from making Faye Resnick's drug use or lifestyle an issue in the case.ARGUMENTGoldman propounded a series of interrogatories to Simpson regarding Faye Resnick and Simpson's contentions relating thereto. Goldman asked: (1) Do you contend that the murder of Nicole Brown Simpson was in any way related to Faye Resnick? [Interrogatory No. 175]; (2) Do you contend that the murder of Nicole Brown Simpson was in any way related to the fact that Faye Resnick had been staying at the home of Nicole Brown Simpson at a time shortly before June 12, 1994? [Interrogatory No. 178]; and (3) Do you contend that the murder of Nicole Brown Simpson was in any way related to the use of illegal drugs by Faye Resnick? [Intndue prejudice, of confusing the issues, or of misleading the jury."). CONCLUSIONFor all of the foregoing reasons, Goldman requests an order prohibiting Simpson from presenting evidence or argument that Faye Resnick used drugs or that the murders of Nicole Brown and Ronald Goldman were in any way related to Faye Resnick.Dated: August 26,1996MITCHELL, SILBERBERG & KNUPPBy: /s/Daniel M.

Plaintiffs' attorneys ask in this Aug. 26, 1996 pretrial motion that they be allowed to 
establish the chain of custody of blood, hair and other physical evidence through LAPD 
criminalists Gregory Matheson and Susan Brockbank. In doing so, the plaintiffs would 
apparently avoid the testimony of criminalist Dennis Fung and other witnesses that 
hampered the prosecution in the criminal trial.</P>

MOTION IN LIMINE OF PLAINTIFF 
FREDRIC GOLDMAN TO PERMIT 
GOLDMAN TO INTRODUCE CHAIN 
OF CUSTODY EVIDENCE THROUGH 
THE TESTIMONY OF TWO 
WITNESSES 
 
Trial Date: September 17, 1996 
 
GOLDMAN MOTION NO. 10 
 
At the trial of this action, plaintiff Fredric Goldman intends to introduce  evidence of the 
results of scientific testing (e.g., DNA tests) performed on key items of  physical 
evidence collected in this case. This physical evidence-including blood, hair, and fibers - 
was collected by a number of LAPD criminalists from the crime scene on Bundy, the 
Rockingham residence, the Ford Bronco, and the body of defendant Orenthal James 
Simpson. Each item of physical evidence was handled by at least three people from the 
time it was collected to the time it was tested. To lay a foundation for the results of 
scientific testing of the physical evidence, Goldman intends to establish a sufficient chain 
of custody for each tested item of physical evidence, showing that it was "reasonably 
certain" that each item tested by a laboratory was the same item that was originally 
collected./1 
 
The actual evidence establishing a continuous chain of custody includes official written 
reports from LAPD personnel and others documenting their collection or handling of 
items of physical evidence and chain of custody reports logging each movement of a 
given item of evidence from its collection to the time it was tested. The chain of custody 
reports necessarily contain the observations of several different individuals. In all, 
hundreds of individual records in combination establish the continuous chain of custody 
for the many items of relevant physical evidence that were collected and tested in this 
case./2 
 
To help streamline the trial, and to avoid unnecessary and lengthy testimony, Goldman 
hereby seeks an order in limine permitting chain of custody to be established for each of 
the items set forth in Appendices A (blood evidence) and B (hair and fiber evidence) 
through the testimony of witnesses Gregory Matheson and Susan Brockbank, 
respectively, and summary exhibits to which the witnesses will refer during their 
testimony. The proposed procedure, which is commonly used in criminal cases, is 
appropriate because: (1) all of the chain of custody documents are admissible under the 
official and business records exceptions to the hearsay rule; (2) the testimony of 
individual members of the chain of custody is not required; and (3) summary evidence (as 
opposed to the introduction of thousands of individual documents) is permitted by the 
voluminous records exception to the best evidence rule. 
 
A. The Chain of Custody Documentation is Admissible Under the Official Records 
Exception to the Hearsay Rule. 
 
Goldman will present competent testimony by witnesses Matheson and Brockbank -- who 
work at the LAPD Scientific Investigations Division and were involved in the collection, 
storing, and testing of the evidence in this case/3  that all of the chain of custody records 
in this case (1) were created by a public employee within the scope and regular course of 
his or her duties/,4 (2) were created "at or near the time of the act, condition, or event" 
recorded, and (3) "[t]he sources of information and method and time of preparation were 
such as to indicate its trustworthiness." Cal. Evid. Code  1271, 1280. In addition to the 
testimony of Goldman's witnesses, the "trustworthiness" of the chain of custody 
documentation also is established by the presumption that public offlcials -- such as the 
LAPD criminalists and scientists in this case - correctly perform their duties. Cal. Evid. 
Code  664 ("It is presumed that official duty has been regularly performed."). Thus, the 
chain of custody documentation at issue is presumptively trustworthy, shifting the burden 
on Simpson to prove otherwise.Based on the testimony of Goldman's "qualified 
witnesses" and the "official duty" presumption, all of the documents establishing the 
chain of custody for the items of physical evidence at issue will be admissible under the 
business and official records exceptions to the hearsay rule. See, e.g.,  County of Sonoma 
v. Grant W., 187 Cal. App. 3d 1439, 1450-52 (1986) (records from blood laboratory 
establishing chain of custody admissible as business records where one witness testified 
to the reliability of the lab's procedures); People v. Aguilar, 16 Cal. App. 3d 1001, 1005 
(1971) (chain of custody statement on envelope containing evidence constituted a 
"practical procedure developed by the police" and satisfied business and official records 
exceptions). 
 
B. The Testimony of Members of the Chain of Custody is Not Required. 
 
The testimony of Matheson and Brockbank that they are familiar with the procedures for 
preparing the various chain of custody documents, that the persons who prepared the 
documents had a duty to do so, and that the documents were prepared at or near the time 
of the events recorded on them is sufficient to establish all of the foundational 
requirements of the business and official records exceptions. People v. Clark 3 Cal. 4th 
41, 151 (1992). The further testimony of the individuals who prepared each entry in the 
various chain of custody documents is unnecessary. California courts routinely admit 
official and business records, including chain of custody documents, without the 
testimony of any of the persons who prepared the records. County of Sonoma 187 Cal. 
App. 3d at 1450-52 (chain of custody records admissible without testimony of individual 
members of chain); Aguilar, 16 Cal. App. 3d at 1005 (same); see also People v. Wardlow, 
118 Cal. App. 3d 375, 388 (1981) (autopsy report admissible without testimony of 
examining coroner who prepared report); People v. Utter, 24 Cal. App. 3d 535, 552 
(1972) (hospital records admissible to prove blood type despite lack of testimony from 
technician who performed blood test). Indeed, the very object of the business and official 
records exceptions is to "eliminate the calling of each witness involved in preparation of 
the record and substitute the record of the transaction instead." County of Sonoma, 187 
Cal. App. 3d at 1451 (business records); McNary. 45 Cal. App. 4th 688 (official records). 
 
C. The Chain of Custody Documentation May Be Introduced Through Summary Exhibits 
and Testimony. 
 
To avoid unnecessarily prolonging the trial in this case, Goldman does not intend to 
introduce into evidence the hundreds of actual chain of custody documents. Instead, 
Goldman seeks to establish the chain of custody for the various items of physical 
evidence (which is simply part of the foundation for the various scientific test results) 
through summary exhibits introduced in connection with the testimony of knowledgeable 
witnesses Matheson and Brockbank. The use of "written or oral" summary evidence 
instead of the original writings is appropriate whenever there are "numerous accounts or 
other writings that cannot be examined in court without great loss of time, and the 
evidence sought from them is only the general result of the whole." Cal. Evid. Code 
1509. Here, the chain of custody documentation consists of a huge number of reports. 
Introduction of each one individually would involve an extensive and unnecessary waste 
of time and judicial resources. Accordingly, Goldman's chain of custody witnesses should 
be permitted to testify regarding chain of custody in summary form and with the aid of 
summary exhibits.5 
 
CONCLUSION 
 
For the foregoing reasons, Goldman respectfully requests that the Court issue an order in 
limine permitting Goldman to establish the chain of custody for the physical evidence 
listed in Appendices A and B through the summary testimony of witnesses Matheson and 
Brockbank, respectively.

FOOTNOTES 
1. To establish a proper chain of custody for the physical evidence at issue, rendering that 
evidence (and the various tests thereon) admissible, Goldman need only "show to the 
satisfaction of the trial court that, taking all the circumstances into account including the 
ease or difficulty with which the particular evidence could have been altered, it is 
reasonably certain that there was no alteration." People v. Riser. 47 Cal. 2d 566, 580 
(1956) (emphasis added). Where there is only "the barest speculation that there was 
tampering, it is proper to admit the evidence and let what doubt remains go to its weight." 
Id. at 581; accord People v. Lozano, 57 Cal. App. 3d 490, 493-96 (1976). 
 
2. The chain of custody documentation consists primarily of the following: (1) property 
reports from criminalists recording the collection or sampling of a particular  item; (2) 
"Request for Physical Evidence Examination" forms documenting the circulation of 
evidence between government agencies; (3) chain of custody logs on the envelopes in 
which evidence was stored and transported; or (4) chain of custody reports --compiled by 
the LAPD, summarizing all movements of each item of evidence, including collection, 
transport to the LAPD crime lab, and all handling of the evidence for testing. 
 
3 During the relevant time period, Gregory Matheson was a chief forensic chemist 1 at, 
and the assistant director of, the LAPD SID laboratory. Among his other duties relating to 
this case, he managed the delivery of items of physical evidence for testing at other 
laboratories. Susan Brockbank was a criminalist assigned to the trace analysis unit of the 
SID and also was involved in delivering relevant items of physical evidence to other 
laboratories for testing. 
 
4 The official records exception is fully applicable to all chain of custody documents in 
this case even though some of the scientific testing at issue was done by non-
governmental laboratories. Imachi v. Dept. of Motor Vehicles, 2 Cal. App. 4th 809, 817 
n.5 (1992) (even where the laboratory performing the tests is not "itself a public entity, 
the Analyst performing chemical tests for a law enforcement agency would be a 'public 
employee' within the statutory definition of that term"), disapproved on other grounds by 
McNary v. Dept. of Motor Vehicles, 45 Cal. App. 4th 688 (1996). Moreover, the business 
records exception applies in any event because "'a business includes every kind of . . . 
governmental activity." Cal. Evid. Code 1270; see also People v. Champion, 9 Cal. 
4th 879, 915-16 (1995) (admitting testimony of fingerprint expert regarding report 
prepared by other laboratory employee because expert's testimony established 
foundational 
facts for business records exception).

5 The "voluminous records" exception to the best evidence rule is subject only to the 
condition that "the court in its discretion may require that [the original] writings be 
produced for inspection by the adverse party." Cal. Evid. Code 1509. Here, Simpson has 
had the underlying chain of custody documents for about two years. If necessary, 
however, Goldman can make them available again.

The plaintiffs wants to bar any evidence relating to former LAPD Detective  
Mark Fuhrman's invocation of the Fifth Amendment privilege against self- 
incrimination during his deposition in the civil trial and during the Simpson criminal trial. Lawyers  argue that presenting such evidence "would only invite the jury to make an improper  inference." This is the Aug. 26, 1996 pretrial motion.

MOTION IN LIMINE OF PLAINTIFF    
FREDRIC GOLDMAN TO EXCLUDE    
EVIDENCE AND ARGUMENT    
REGARDING MARK FUHRMAN'S    
CLAIM OF THE FIFTH AMENDMENT    
PRIVILEGE AGAINST SELF    
INCRIMINATION    
    
Trial Date: September 17, 1996    
    
GOLDMAN MOTION NO. 13    
    
Plaintiff Fredric Goldman anticipates that defendant Orenthal James Simpson may 
attempt to introduce evidence or argument at the trial of this action relating to former 
LAPD Detective Mark Fuhrman's assertion of the Fifth Amendment privilege against     
self-incrimination during his deposition in this case and during Simpson's criminal trial.    
This Court should exclude any such evidence and argument.    
    
The Evidence Code is directly on point. It mandates that:    
    
"If . . . on a prior occasion a privilege . . . was exercised not to  testify with respect to any 
matter . . ., neither the presiding  officer nor counsel may comment thereon, no 
presumption shall arise because of the exercise of the privilege, and the trier of fact may 
not draw any inference therefrom as to the  credibility of the witness or as to any matter at 
issue in the proceeding."    
    
Cal. Evid. Code  913(a); People v. Frierson, 53 Cal. 3d 730, 743 (1991) ("No inference 
may properly be drawn from the invocation of a privilege."); see also Buchler v. 
Sbardellati, 34 Cal. App. 4th 1527, 154142 (1995) (prohibiting argument regarding the 
assertion of a privilege by a witness during discovery).    
    
Thus, allowing Simpson to present evidence and argument regarding Fuhrman's 
invocation of the Fifth Amendment privilege "would only invite the jury to 
make an improper inference." Frierson, 53 Cal. 3d at 743. Simpson has no "right to 
present to the jury [such] a speculative, factually unfounded inference." People v. 
Mincey, 2 Cal. 4th 408, 442 (1992) (noting that inferences drawn "from the mere exercise 
of the privilege would be improper and [are] at best based on speculation, not evidence").    
    
Accordingly, Goldman respectfully requests that the Court issue an order in limine 
prohibiting Simpson from presenting evidence or argument at the trial of this action 
regarding Detective Fuhrman's prior invocations of the Fifth Amendment privilege.

alleged racist statements and conduct.  He maintain that the "theory that Fuhrman planted 
the bloody glove...is not based on admissible evidence...and the evidence of racism is 
substantially outweighed by its tendency to prejudice the jury and unduly delay the trial."

MOTION IN LIMINE OF PLAINTIFF 
FREDRIC GOLDMAN TO EXCLUDE 
EVIDENCE AND ARGUMENT 
REGARDING MARK FUHRMAN'S 
ALLEGED RACISM 
 
 
Trial Date: September 17, 1996 
 
GOLDMAN MOTION NO. 14 
 
Plaintiff Fredric Goldman anticipates that defendant Orenthal James Simpson will 
attempt to introduce evidence or argument of alleged statements and past conduct of 
former LAPD Detective Mark Fuhrman that establishes his racial bias. Specifically, 
Simpson may attempt to introduce evidence that: (1) well over 10 years ago, Fuhrman 
allegedly made racially disparaging remarks in connection with a lawsuit against the City 
of Los Angeles for disability; (2) about 10 years ago, defense witness Kathleen Bell 
allegedly heard Fuhrman make racist comments; and (3) in taped interviews with Laura 
Hart McKinney relating to her development of fictional materials regarding the LAPD, 
Fuhrman used the word "nigger" and described certain supposed incidents of police 
misconduct. From this evidence, Simpson will argue that Fuhrman is a racist, and thus 
had a motive to plant the bloody glove found at Simpson's Rockingham estate in an 
alleged attempt to frame Simpson. The Court should exclude this evidence for two 
independent reasons: (1) because Simpson's theory that Fuhrman planted the bloody 
glove at Rockingham and blood in Simpson's Bronco is not based on admissible evidence 
and is thus improper, the evidence regarding racism is irrelevant; and (2) even if the 
Court allows Simpson to argue that Fuhrman planted evidence, the probative value of the 
evidence of racism is substantially outweighed by its tendency to prejudice the jury and 
unduly delay the trial. 
 
Evidence Code Section" 350 provides that "[n]o evidence is admissible except relevant 
evidence." To be relevant, evidence must have a "tendency in reason to prove or disprove 
any disputed fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action." Cal. Evid. 
Code  210.By separate motions, Goldman has moved to exclude all evidence and 
argument by Simpson that the bloody glove found at Rockingham and the blood found in 
the Bronco were planted. As more fully explained in these motions, Simpson's planting 
theories lack any evidentiary support, and Simpson thus should not be allowedto ask any 
questions of witnesses or make any statements to the jury regarding the alleged planting 
of the glove or the Bronco blood. 
 
Because the only relevance of Fuhrman's racism is its link to planting, exclusion of 
evidence and argument on the planting theories will render the evidence of Fuhrman's 
racism without a link to "any disputed fact that is of consequence to the determination of 
the action."' In other words, the evidence of racism will become utterly irrelevant and 
thus inadmissible under Section 350. 
 
Furthermore, under Evidence Code Section 352, evidence is properly excluded "if its 
probative value is substantially outweighed by the probability that its admission will (a) 
necessitate undue consumption of time or (b) create substantial danger of undue 
prejudice, of confusing the issues, or of misleading the jury." Even if the Court allows 
Simpson to argue that Fuhrman planted evidence (which it should not), evidence of 
Fuhrman's racism should be excluded under Section 352. 
 
Under the standards set forth by the California Supreme Court in People v. Kaurish, 52 
Cal. 3d 648, 685 (1990), the evidence of racism in this case has nonexistent or minimal 
probative value and should be excluded. In Kaurish,  the defendant wanted to introduce 
evidence that a third party "had a motive for being angry with the victim's mother, and 
possibly the victim," and argue from that evidence that the third party (and not the 
defendant) killed the victim. 52 Cal. 3d at 685. The Supreme Court first noted that mere 
evidence that another person may have had a "motive or opportunity" to commit the act 
the defendant is alleged to have committed, "without more, will not suffice . . .: there 
must be direct or circumstantial evidence linking the third person to the actual" 
commission of the act. Id. The Court then concluded that the defendant's motive evidence 
was properly excluded because "the slight probative value, if any, of [the] evidence was 
substantially outweighed by the possibility of jury confusion and undue delay." Id. 
 
The same is true here. Simpson's allegations regarding Fuhrman's racism are nothing 
more than an attempt to establish a motive for Fuhrman's alleged planting of evidence. 
Apart from this evidence of motive, Simpson has no "direct or circumstantial evidence 
linking" Fuhrman to the alleged planting of the glove. Thus, under Kaurish, Simpson's 
evidence "will not suffice." 
 
Furthermore, in this civil case, Simpson bears a heavier burden of producing the required 
"direct or circumstantial evidence" of planting than did the criminal defendant in Kaurish; 
Simpson cannot merely raise a reasonable doubt that Fuhrman may have planted the 
glove. Because Fuhrman was a police officer, Evidence Code Section 664 establishes a 
presumption that he properly performed his duties in finding and pointing out the glove 
found at the Rockingham estate. Cal. Evid. Code  664 ("It is presumed that official duty 
has been regularly performed."); People v. Harris, 213 Cal. App. 2d 365, 369 (1963) ("in 
the void of specific testimony . . . the courts cannot infer improper motives or activities 
on the part of [police] officers, but must presume that the officers regularly and lawfully 
performed their duties").In this civil action, Simpson's burden for rebutting the 
presumption established by Section 664 is by a preponderance of the evidence. See Cal. 
Evid. Code  115 ("Except as otherwise provided by law, the burden of proof requires 
proof by apreponderance of the evidence.'). Accordingly, Simpson must prove by a 
preponderance of the evidence that Fuhrman deviated from his official duties by planting 
the glove in an effort to frame him. If evidence of mere "motive and opportunity" is not 
sufficient to establish a reasonable doubt regarding planting, see Kaurish. 52 Cal. 3d at 
685, it certainly cannot establish planting by a preponderance of the evidence. 
Accordingly, the evidence of racism has little, if any, probative value on the only issue to 
which it is even arguably relevant. 
 
Despite its slight probative value, evidence of Fuhrman's racism clearly will prejudice 
and confuse the jury. No juror will be able to avoid the prejudice engendered by the 
mention of the word "rigger" and other racially disparaging remarks. This is precisely the 
type of evidence - powerful, inflammatory, prejudicial, but marginally relevant at best -- 
that Section 352 was designed to exclude. 
 
Moreover, the introduction by Simpson of evidence regarding Fuhrman's alleged 
statements and conduct will require Goldman to call numerous witnesses to contradict 
Simpson's evidence. For example, if Kathleen Bell is allowed to testify regarding the 
statements she allegedly heard Fuhrman make, Goldman would call other witnesses who 
were present to contradict her testimony. A lengthy "trial within a trial" would also ensue 
with respect to the McKinney interview tapes. Given the extraordinarily low probative 
value of Simpson's evidence, the time involved cannot be justified. 
 
For the foregoing reasons, Goldman respectfully requests that the Court issue an order in 
limine prohibiting Simpson from presenting evidence or argument at the trial of this 
action regarding Detective Fuhrman's alleged past racist statements and conduct.

FOOTNOTE: 
1. In his interrogatory responses, Simpson did not even mention Fuhrman's racism as a 
"fact" supporting his planting theory. To the extent Simpson has abandoned this theory of 
relevance, the evidence of Fuhrman's racism is irrelevant regardless of the outcome of the 
motion in limine addressed to the planting theory. 
 
Moreover, the evidence clearly cannot be admitted as relevant to Fuhrman's credibility in 
this case because he will not be a witness at the trial of this action. In any event, even if 
Fuhrman's credibility were at issue, all of the considerations supporting exclusion of the 
evidence under Evidence Code Section 352 would still apply.

MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES  
  
1. OUT-OF-COURT STATEMENTS CONCERNING DEFENDANTS CONDUCT  
AND RELATIONSHIP WITH NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON ARE INADMISSIBLE  
HEARSAY.  
  
Even if this Court were to determine that evidence of Mr.  
Simpson's alleged domestic discord with Nicole Brown  
Simpson is relevant and that its probative value outweighs  
its prejudicial impact, the Court must still examine each  
item of proffered evidence to determine whether it is  
admissible under California's rule against hearsay  
evidence.  
  
We anticipate that entire categories of evidence that will  
be offered by the plaintiffs constitute hearsay1/ including  
writings which purport to be a diary or journal entries  
made by Nicole Brown Simpson. People v. Livaditis (1992) 2  
Cal.4th 759, 831 P.2d 297, 9 Cal.Rptr.2d 721. See also,  
California Evidence Code, Section 403 and 405.  
  
2. ANY ALLEGED OUT-OF-COURT STATEMENTS BY NICOLE BROWN  
SIMPSON TO FRIENDS OR FAMILY EXPRESSING FEAR OF DEFENDANT,  
ARE INADMISSIBLE HEARSAY.  
  
The plaintiffs may attempt to introduce out-of-court  
statements allegedly made by Nicole Brown Simpson to  
friends or family members expressing fear of the defendant,  
or asserting that the defendant had followed, mistreated or  
threatened her in some fashion. Any such evidence is  
hearsay and cannot be admitted at Trial since it does not  
fall within one of California's specific statutory  
exceptions to the hearsay rule.  
  
Nicole Brown Simpson's out-of-court comments to others  
concerning her feeling about defendant might be probative  
of her state of mind. But Nicole Brown Simpson's state of  
mind is not an issue in this case, and evidence of a  
declarants state of mind is "itself an issue in the action"  
or is "offered to prove or explain acts or conduct of the  
declarant". Cal. Evidence Code, Section 1250(a)(1) and  
(2).2 Consequently, since neither Brown's state of mind,  
nor her conduct preceding the murder, is of any relevance,  
her out-of-court statements cannot be introduced pursuant  
to the "state of mind" exception to the hearsay rule.  
  
The California Supreme Court has made it crystal clear that  
hearsay statements by a victim expressing fear of the  
defendant or relating threats of physical harm are not  
admissible to provide that the defendant, in fact,  
threatened the victim, and cannot be rendered admissible  
under the guise of "state of mind" evidence unless the  
victim's state of mind or his conduct preceding the crime  
is an actual issue in dispute. See. e.a., People v. Arcega  
(1982) 32 Cal.3d 504, 651 P.2d 338, 186 Cal.Rptr. 94 (error  
to admit testimony by victim's mother that victim has told  
her shortly before the murder that defendant was following  
her around and treating her "weird", and was going to "hurt  
her" or "beat her up"); People v. Ireland (1969) 70 Cal.2d  
522, 450 P.2d 580, 75 Cal.Rptr. 188 (error to admit  
statement by victim on the morning she was killed that her  
husband was going to kill her); People v. Armendariz (1984)  
37 Cal.3d 573, 693 P.2d 243, 209 Cal.Rptr.644; People v.  
Ruiz (1988) 44 Cal.3d 589, 729 P.2d 854, 244 Cal.Rptr. 200;  
People v. Noguera (1992) 4 Cal.4th 599, 842 P.2d 1160, 15  
Cal.Rptr. 400.  
  
Evidence that Brown told people, including statements in  
written form, that she was fearful of Simpson, or that he  
had beaten her, or that he had followed her, is classic  
hearsay if introduced to prove that Simpson, in fact,  
committed these acts, or in fact, threatened Brown with  
physical harm. It presents all the "traditional hearsay  
dangers", since Brown's memory, perception and sincerity  
cannot be tested. Moreover, since Brown's state of mind is  
not an issue in this case, testimony purporting to relate  
Brown's out-of-court statements cannot be admitted pursuant  
to the "state of mind" exception to the hearsay rule. The  
evidence must be excluded.  
  
3. ANY ALLEGED OUT-OF-COURT STATEMENTS CONCERNING DEFENDANT  
MADE BY NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON TO THERAPISTS OR PHYSICIANS  
ARE INADMISSIBLE HEARSAY.  
  
Therapists like Dr. Susan Forward and Jennifer Ameli, have  
made public statements (in apparent violation of  
professional obligations of patient confidentiality)  
claiming that they served as therapists for Nicole Brown  
Simpson, and that Nicole confided in them that she was  
fearful of the defendant. Any such out-of-court statements,  
like those to friends or family, are hearsay and  
inadmissible.  
  
People v. Bunyard (1988) 45 Cal.3d 1189, 756 P.2d 795, 249  
Cal.Rptr. 7112, is dispositive. There, the trial court  
admitted the testimony of the victim's doctor that she had  
related that the defendant, her husband, had assaulted her,  
had threatened to kill her, and that she was frightened of  
him. This testimony was admitted as purported non-hearsay  
"history by a patient to a treating physician". The Supreme  
Court held that the statements were hearsay and should have  
been excluded.  
  
The Court first reiterated that hearsay evidence is not  
rendered admissible "simply by identifying a non-hearsay  
purpose admitting the statement". 45 Cal.3d at 1204, 756  
P.2d at 804, 249 Cal.Rptr. at 80. Rather, the trial court  
must find that the "non-hearsay purpose is relevant to an  
issue in dispute". Id. Since neither the victim's medical  
treatment nor her mental state were at issue in the case,  
the articulated non-hearsay purpose of the statements was  
irrelevant and could not justify their admission into  
evidence.  
  
Moreover, the statements were not admissible as evidence of  
the cause of a physical condition. As the court explained,  
"While a statement pointing to the cause of a physical  
condition may be admissible if it is made by a patient to  
a physician, the statement must be necessary to proper  
diagnosis and treatment and is admissible only to show the  
basis of a medical opinion, not for the purpose of  
establishing the truth of the facts contained therein". Id.  
at 1250, n.4, 756 P.2d at 804, n.4, 294 Cal.Rptr. at 80,  
n.4 (emphasis added). Thus, the victim's statements to her  
doctor, even assuming they were relevant to his medical  
opinion and that his medial opinion was relevant to the 
case, could not be admitted to provide the fact  
asserted-that her husband beat her and threatened to kill  
her.

Indeed, the California Courts routinely hold that  
statements made to physicians allegedly relating the cause  
of an injury or the basis for a diagnosis are not  
admissible to prove the truth of the matter asserted, even  
under the guise of expert opinion. Johnson v. Aetna Life  
Ins. Co. (1963) 21 Cal.App.2d 247, 252, 34 Cal.Rptr. 484;  
In re: Cheryl (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 1098, 200 Cal.Rptr.  
789; People v. Young (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 891, 234  
Cal.Rptr. (psychiatric records relied upon by experts  
inadmissible hearsay).  
  
Any statements made by Brown to a physician in connection  
with the 1989 New Year's Eve incident, or at any other  
time, that purport to relate the cause of any injuries are  
hearsay and cannot be admitted to prove the truth of the  
facts asserted. Moreover, Brown's state of mind is no more  
at issue in this case than was the victim's state of mind  
in Bunyard. Her diagnosis or treatment by a mental health  
professional is of no relevance and there is no conceivable  
ground for allowing her doctors to testify about those  
matters. Thus, any statements Brown may have made to a  
psychiatrist, psychologist or other therapist concerning  
the defendant, likewise constitute hearsay, whether related  
by a doctor on the stand or whether contained in a  
physician's report, and cannot be admitted into evidence  
since they do not qualify under any recognized exception to  
the hearsay rule.  
  
5. CONCLUSION.  
  
Based on the foregoing, it is respectfully requested that  
this Court preclude any and all references by plaintiffs  
and/or plaintiffs' attorneys of out-of-court statements  
concerning defendant's conduct and relationship with Nicole  
Brown Simpson as they are inadmissible hearsay.

ENDNOTES  
  
1/ "Hearsay evidence" is defined as "evidence of a  
statement that was made other than by a witness while  
testifying at the hearing and that is offered to provide  
the truth of the matter stated." Cal. Evidence Code.  
Section 1200(a). "Except as otherwise provided by law,  
hearsay evidence is inadmissible. Cal. Evid. Code, Section  
1200(b).  
  
California, by statute, recognizes that even admissible  
hearsay raises constitutional concerns, Section 1204 of the  
Evidence Code provides:  
  
A statement that is otherwise admissible as hearsay  
evidence is inadmissible against the defendant in a  
criminal action if the statement was made, either by the  
defendant or by another, under circumstances- that it is  
inadmissible against the defendant under the constitution  
of the United States or the State of California.  
  
2/ Section 1250 of the Evidence Code, the hearsay exception  
for a statement of declarants then existing mental or  
physical state", provides as follows:  
  
(a) Subject to section 1252, evidence of a statement of the  
declarants then existing state of mind, emotion, or  
physical sensation (including a statement of intent, plan,  
motive, design, mental feeling, pain, or bodily health) is  
not made inadmissible by the hearsay rule when;  
  
(1) The evidence is offered to prove the declarants state  
of mind, emotion, or physical sensation at that time or at  
any other time when it is itself an issue in the action; or  
(2) the evidence is offered to prove or explain acts or  
conduct of the declarant.  
  
(b) This section does not make admissible evidence of a  
statement of memory or belief to prove the fact remembered  
or believed.  
  
Even when a statement appears to meet the requirements of  
Section 1250, it cannot be admitted if it is untrustworthy.  
Section 1252, entitled a "limitation on admissibility of  
statement of mental or physical state", provides that  
"evidence of a statement is inadmissible under this article  
if the statement was made under such circumstances as to  
indicate its lack of trustworthiness".  
  
This limitation is intended to exclude statements "made  
with a motive to misrepresent or manufacture evidence".  
1966 Law Rev. Comm. Comment. Plainly, statements made about
one's relationships involve complex emotions and, as anyone
who has ever been married knows, spouses often say things
about one another and about their feelings towards their
spouse that are just not the truth.

<P>
Stating that "the death of Nicole Brown Simpson bears none of the traditional signs of 
spousal homicide," the defense asks the judge to bar the plaintiffs from introducing 
evidence of domestic discord in the Simpson marriage. This would include the Oct. 25, 
1993 call to 911 and the "Zlomsowitch incident," when O.J. Simpson allegedly spied on 
his wife engaging in sex with another man. The defense contends that "evidence that a 
defendant has previously committed crimes or other bad acts is not admissible to prove 
how the defendant acted on a particular occasion, or to prove his propensity to commit 
the offense with which he had been charged," under the California Evidence Code. The 
defense claims that the plaintiffs' objective with this evidence is to unfairly prejudice the 
jury against Simpson. This pretrial motion was filed Aug. 26, 1996. </P>

Plaintiff, 
 
vs. 
 
ORENTHAL JAMES SIMPSON, 
 
Defendant. 
 
 
TO ALL PARTIES AND TO THEIR ATTORNEYS OF RECORD: 
 
Defendant, ORENTHAL JAMES SIMPSON, hereby moves this Court 
for an Order instructing plaintiffs and their counsel not 
to refer to, interrogate any witness concerning, comment 
on, or attempt to suggest to the jury in any way, any 
information concerning the financial condition of the 
defendant until such time as plaintiffs have produced 
evidence of a prima facie case of liability for damages 
pursuant to California Civil Code, Section 3294. 
 
This Motion is made on the grounds that as a maker of law, 
pursuant to California Civil Code, Section 3295, plaintiffs 
may not introduce evidence concerning the defendant's 
profits or financial condition until after the trier of 
fact returns a verdict for plaintiffs awarding actual 
damages, and finds the defendant guilty of malice, 
oppression, or fraud, in accordance with Section 3294. 
 
This Motion is based upon the Memorandum of Points and 
Authorities attached hereto, on the papers and records on 
file herein, and on such oral and documentary evidence as 
may be presented at the hearing of this Motion.

BAKER, SILBERBERG & KEENER 
 
By /s/ 
ROBERT C. BAKER 
Attorneys for Defendant 
ORENTHAL JAMES SIMPSON 
 
 
MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES 
 
1. STATEMENT OF FACTS. 
 
In their prayer for damages, plaintiffs seek to recover 
punitive damages. It is anticipated at the Trial of this 
action plaintiffs will attempt to introduce evidence 
concerning the worth and financial condition of defendant, 
ORENTHAL JAMES SIMPSON. Evidence concerning defendant's 
worth and financial condition will be irrelevant to this 
action until such time as plaintiffs have produced evidence 
of a prima facie case of liability for punitive damages. 
Additionally, prior to that time, if this ever occurs, 
defendant contends that the probative value of such 
evidence is substantially outweighed by the probability 
that its admission will create substantial danger of undue 
prejudice to this moving defendant. Moreover, plaintiffs 
should be precluded from presenting such evidence pursuant 
to California Civil Code, Section 3295. 
 
2. THE COURT MAY GRANT A PROTECTIVE ORDER REQUIRING 
PLAINTIFFS TO PRODUCE EVIDENCE OF A PRIMA FACIE CASE OF 
LIABILITY FOR PUNITIVE DAMAGES PRIOR TO INTRODUCING 
EVIDENCE OF FINANCIAL CONDITION OR PROFITS. 
 
 
California Civil Code, Section 3295 states in pertinent 
part as follows: "(a) The court may, for good cause, grant 
any defendant a protective order requiring the plaintiff to 
produce evidence of a prima facie case of liability for 
damages pursuant to Section 3294, prior to the introduction 
of evidence of: (1 ) The profits the defendant has gained 
by virtue of the wrongful course of conduct of the nature 
and type shown by the evidence. (2) The financial condition 
of the defendant." 
 
 
Pursuant to Section 3295 above, this Court has the power to 
grant the protective order requested herein. Plaintiffs 
should not be allowed to discuss the financial condition or 
worth of defendant until after the trier of fact returns a 
verdict for plaintiffs, awarding actual damages, and finds 
the defendant guilty of malice, oppression, or fraud in 
accordance with Section 3294, should such an event ever 
even occur. 
 
3. THE NET WORTH OR FINANCIAL CONDITION OF DEFENDANT IS 
IRRELEVANT. 
 
As stated above, plaintiffs should not be allowed to 
comment on the net worth or financial condition of 
defendant until such time, if ever, plaintiffs produce 
evidence of liability for punitive damages. It is highly 
unlikely that plaintiffs will be able to do this at the 
Trial of this action. Accordingly, evidence concerning the 
net worth or financial condition of defendant is irrelevant 
to this action. California Evidence Code, Section 350 
states that "no evidence is admissible except relevant 
evidence". Accordingly, in the event that plaintiffs cannot 
produce evidence of liability for punitive damages on the 
part of this moving defendant, evidence concerning 
defendant's net worth or financial condition is 
inadmissible in this action pursuant to Section 350. 
 
4. THE PROBATIVE VALUE OF EVIDENCE CONCERNING DEFENDANTS 
FINANCIAL CONDITION IS SUBSTANTIALLY OUTWEIGHED BY THE 
PROBABILITY THAT ITS ADMISSION WILL CREATE DANGER OF UNDUE 
PREJUDICE TO DEFENDANT. 
 
 
California Evidence Code, Section 352 states as follows: 
"The court in its discretion may exclude evidence if its 
probative value is substantially outweighed by the 
probability that its admission will (a) necessitate undue 
consumption of time, or (b) create substantial danger of 
undue prejudice, of confusing the issues, or of misleading 
the jury." 
 
 
As stated above, it is unlikely that plaintiffs will be 
able to produce evidence of liability for punitive damages 
on the part of moving defendant. Hence, plaintiffs should 
be prohibited from introducing evidence concerning the 
financial condition of defendant pursuant to Civil Code, 
Section 3295, set out above. Additionally, defendant 
contends that the probative value of evidence concerning 
the defendant's net worth or financial condition is 
substantially outweighed by the probability that its 
admission will create substantial danger of undue prejudice 
against the defendant. Accordingly, such evidence should be 
excluded at the Trial of this action. 
 
5. CONCLUSION. 
 
In light of the foregoing, defendant respectfully requests 
that this Court Order plaintiffs and their counsel, not to 
refer to, interrogate any witness concerning, comment on, 
or attempt to suggest to the jury in any way, any facts 
concerning the net worth or financial condition of 
defendant, ORENTHAL JAMES SIMPSON, until such time, if 
ever, plaintiffs produce evidence of a prima facie case of 
liability for damages pursuant to California Civil Code, 
Section 3294.

<P>
The defense argues that the introduction of evidence of O.J. Simpson's alleged drug use 
or adultery would be inadmissible in the civil action because it's immaterial and would be 
prejudicial. Simpson's lawyers accuse the plaintiffs of attempting "character 
assassination" on their client. Though Al Cowlings admits that he saw Simpson use 
cocaine, the defense points out that that was more than seven years before the murders 
and that Simpson has no criminal record for drug use. In regard to allegations of 
infidelity, the defense claims that these are irrelevant because the Simpsons were 
divorced and had not been living together for more than two years before the murders. 
This is the Aug. 26, 1996 pretrial motion.

DISCOVERY AND 
MOTION CUT-OFF: 6/15/96 
 
TRIAL DATE: 9/17/96 
 
 
TO ALL PARTIES AND TO THEIR ATTORNEYS OF RECORD: 
 
COMES NOW, defendant, ORENTHAL JAMES SIMPSON, hereby moves 
this Court for an order precluding plaintiffs from 
offering, introducing, intimating or suggesting at the time 
of Trial any evidence in reference to any conduct by 
Orenthal James Simpson regarding drug use or adultery 
occurring prior to the allegations set forth by plaintiffs. 
Any such evidence would be inadmissible in the civil action 
because such evidence is immaterial of the essential 
element of any cause of action contained in plaintiffs' 
Complaints and the admission of such evidence would be 
prejudicial to defendant. 
 
This Motion will further be based upon the Memorandum of 
Points and Authorities attached hereto, the Declaration of 
Robert C. Baker, on the papers and records on file herein, 
and on such oral and documentary evidence as may be 
presented at the hearing of this Motion. 
 
DATED: August 20, 1996 
 
BAKER, SILBERBERG & KEENER 
 
By /s/ 
ROBERT C. BAKER 
Attorneys for Defendant 
ORENTHAL JAMES SIMPSON 
 
 
MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES 
 
1. STATEMENT OF FACTS. 
 
As this Court is aware, the pending action relates to a 
double homicide occurring on June 12,1994. 
 
2. EVIDENCE OF PRIOR DRUG USE OR EXTRAMARITAL AFFAIRS IS 
IRRELEVANT AND INADMISSIBLE. 
 
According to California Evidence Code, Section 351, only 
relevant evidence will be admissible in any proceeding. The 
relevancy of evidence depends on the issues in the case. 
Evidence which does not relate to a matter in issue is 
immaterial. People v. Rhinehart (1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 1. In 
the instant case, any purported evidence of drug use or 
purported infidelity by defendant which occurred in the 
years prior to plaintiffs' allegations does not relate to 
any matters at issue in this case and is therefore 
irrelevant. As such, it should be excluded at the time of 
Trial, pursuant to Section 351. 
 
3. EVEN IF THE EVIDENCE IS RELEVANT. THE PREJUDICIAL IMPACT 
OF EVIDENCE OF PURPORTED PRIOR DRUG USE FAR OUTWEIGHS ANY 
PROBATIVE VALUE. 
 
California Evidence Code, Section 352 provides that: 
 
 
"The court in its discretion may exclude evidence if its - 
- probative value is substantially outweighed by the 
probability that its admission will (a) necessitate undue 
consumption of time or (b) create substantial danger of 
undue prejudice, of confusing the issues, or of misleading 
the jury." 
 
 
A. Undue Consumption of Time. 
 
In the present action, the admission of purported evidence 
of prior drug use by Orenthal James Simpson presents great 
risks of undue consumption of time by extending the Court's 
resources to litigate a peripheral, irrelevant matter as 
well as creating the need for lengthy examination of 
witnesses. Preclusion of such matters would greatly reduce 
the duration of a trial already projected to last as long 
as six months. 
 
B. Substantial Danger of Undue Prejudice, Confusion of the 
Issues, and Misleading the Jury. 
 
The prejudicial impact of evidence of purported prior drug 
use must not only be weighed against the probative value of 
such evidence, but also must be assessed in light of the 
remoteness of the instances and the impact upon fair 
consideration of the defense being presented. While 
remoteness ordinarily goes to the weight to be accorded 
evidence, it is especially significant in exercising 
discretion pursuant to Section 352 where the danger of 
prejudice is grave. See Casey v. Casey (1950) 97 Cal.App.2d 
875 
 
In the within matter, there is absolutely no relevancy to 
any purported previous drug use, or any purported 
infidelity. The Trial of this matter is simply to determine 
whether or not Mr. Simpson was the murderer of Nicole Brown 
Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman on June 12, 1994. The issue 
of any purported drug use is absolutely irrelevant to who 
caused the deaths of plaintiffs' decedent. In fact, any 
allegation or purported drug use goes back to a period of 
more than seven (7) years before the murders. (See 
deposition transcript of Alan Cowling at page 297, lines 
13-25 and page 298, lines 11- 15, attached hereto as 
Exhibit "A". See also, deposition transcript of Joe 
Stellini at page 132, at/ached hereto as Exhibit "B".) 
 
Indeed, the evidence of any purported drug use is an 
a4.tempt by plaintiffs to do a character assassination on 
the defendant, Orenthal James Simpson, and to have the jury 
disregard the evidence, or lack thereof, relative to Mr. 
Simpson's culpability in the murders of June 12, 1994. 
 
As this Court is aware, evidence of "prior offenses" such 
as drug use, should be received with caution and admitted 
only when its probative value outweighs its prejudicial 
effect. People v. Evers (1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 588. As the 
Court is aware, Mr. Simpson has never had a prior offense 
of drug use. 
 
4. EVIDENCE OF PURPORTED EXTRAMARITAL AFFAIRS IS PERIPHERAL 
AND PREJUDICIAL AND SHOULD NOT BE ADMITTED. 
 
Similarly, any evidence of purported prior extramarital 
affairs by Mr. Simpson is peripheral and will unduly 
prejudice his defense. In Carr v. Pacific Telephone 
Company, another wrongful death suit, evidence of an 
extramarital affair was found to be so remote so as to be 
more prejudicial than probative, and this evidence was 
excluded. Carr v. Pacific Telephone Company (1972) 26 
Cal.App.3d 537, 545-46. 
 
Evidence of Mr. Simpson's purported extramarital affairs 
have no bearing on the allegations of plaintiffs' 
complaints. Such evidence is remote, likely to lead to 
undue consumption of time, and likely to mislead a jury. 
Evidence of infidelity may be of interest for the tabloid 
media, but such a peripheral issue should not be litigated 
in this courtroom. 
 
Nicole Brown Simpson and Orenthal James Simpson, were 
separated in early 1992, and divorce proceedings commenced 
in February of 1992. By November of 1992, the divorce 
proceedings between Mr. Simpson and Nicole Brown Simpson 
had become final. 
 
Hence, for a period more than two (2) years before the 
murders of June 12, 1994, Mr. Simpson and Nicole Brown 
Simpson were not living together, and were divorced a 
substantial period prior to the murders taking place. The 
issue of whether or not Mr. Simpson had any extramarital 
relationships is therefore totally irrelevant and remote 
from any issue that will be litigated by the jury in the 
within matter. 5. CONCLUSION. - 
 
For the foregoing reasons, defendant respectfully requests 
that any and all evidence of purported prior drug use and 
purported extramarital affairs be excluded from this Trial.

Defense lawyers accuses the plaintiffs of "playing to the media" in the discovery phase of 
the case. In this Aug. 26, 1996, pretrial motion, they say plaintiffs' lawyers deliberately 
asked potential witnesses for personal opinions on whether O.J. Simpson is guilty of 
murdering his former wife and Ronald Goldman in an effort to manufacture soundbites in 
the media and infect the jury pool. The defense says such opinions are irrelevant and 
should be excluded from the trial.

ROBERT C. BAKER 
Attorneys for Defendant 
ORENTHAL JAMES SIMPSON 
 
 
MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES 
 
1. INTRODUCTION. 
 
Throughout the commencement of discovery in the pending 
action, plaintiffs' counsel has sought on numerous 
occasions, to illicit to whether or not the witnesses 
believed that ORENTHAL JAMES SIMPSON was responsible for 
the crimes of June 12, 1994. The inquiries by plaintiffs' 
counsel of witnesses asking various witnesses of their 
personal opinions, concerning the guilt or innocence of Mr. 
Simpson, were almost without exception relayed to the T.V. 
tabloids who dedicated entire programs to someone's opinion 
as to whether or not Mr. Simpson was guilty or innocent. It 
was clear during the discovery phase of this case, that 
plaintiffs' counsel were playing to the media, and were 
searching for sound-bites in an effort to infect the jury 
pool. It is defendant's concern that plaintiffs may attempt 
to refer to or draw out such irrelevant opinions to try to 
taint the potential jury pool during the progress of this 
litigation. Such references are irrelevant and prejudicial 
and thus, should be excluded. 
 
2. EVIDENCE PRESENTED RELATING TO WHETHER DEFENDANT 
COMMITTED THE CRIMES OF JUNE 12. 1994. 
 
California Evidence Code, Section 350, states as follows: 
 
"No evidence is admissible except relevant evidence." 
 
In the pending action, such references as to whether lay 
witnesses believed defendant committed the crimes of June 
12, 1994, will be irrelevant to the subject litigation. 
Rather, the emphasis of this litigation is the presentation 
of evidence before the jurors so that the jurors will be 
able to evaluate the evidence and come to their own 
determination. Any reference by any witnesses as to their 
beliefs of ORENTHAL JAMES SIMPSON's responsibility or lack 
of responsibility for the crimes of June 12, 1994, is 
irrelevant to the pending lawsuit and should be precluded. 
 
3.  PROBATIVE VALUE OF EVIDENCE CONCERNING THE 
AFOREMENTIONED OPINION IS OUTWEIGHED BY THE PROBABILITY 
THAT ITS ADMISSION WILL CREATE SUBSTANTIAL DANGER OR UNDUE 
PREJUDICE AND HARM. 
 
California Evidence Code, Section 352 states as follows: 
 
"The court in its discretion may exclude evidence if its 
probative value substantially is outweighed by the 
probability that its admission will (a) necessitate undue 
consumption of time or (b) create substantial danger of 
undue prejudice of confusing the issues, or of misleading 
the jury." 
 
Evidence concerning such opinions as to lay witnesses to 
whether or not ORENTHAL JAMES SIMPSON is responsible for 
the crimes of June 12, 1994 is prejudicial, and has 
absolutely no relevancy to the pending action. 
 
Plaintiffs ought to be required to present such evidence 
before the jury and have the jurors determine whether or 
not they believe ORENTHAL JAMES SIMPSON committed the 
crimes of June 12, 1994. Any references to opinions of 
various lay witnesses proffered during the course of the 
Trial will only confuse the jury as to the true issues 
involved in this case. 
 
4. CONCLUSION. 
 
Based on the foregoing, it is respectfully requested that 
this Court preclude any and all references by lay witnesses 
to whether or not defendant, ORENTHAL JAMES SIMPSON, is 
responsible for the crimes of June 12, 1994.

Nicole Brown Simpson should not be characterized as a "battered wife," O.J. Simpson 
should not be described as a "stalker" in the wrongful death trial, argues the defense in 
this Aug. 26, 1996 pretrial motion. These terms, used by psychologists, are also widely 
used by the general public and have picked up "a strong secondary meaning which itself 
will have a prejudicial impact" on the jury. The defense also asks that the plaintiffs not be 
allowed to call psychologists that would provide a psychological "profile" of the 
defendant.</P>

BAKER, SILBERBERG & KEENER 
 
By /s/ 
ROBERT C. BAKER 
Attorneys for Defendant 
ORENTHAL JAMES SIMPSON 
 
 
MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES 
 
1. THE USE OF SUCH TERMS AS "BATTERER" OR "STALKER" IS 
PREJUDICIAL AND HAS NO PROBATIVE VALUE. 
 
Apart from the danger of prejudice and confusion arising 
from the introduction of the alleged incidents of domestic 
discord between defendant and Nicole Brown Simpson, is the 
question of how those incidents are characterized in 
presentation before the jury. The defendant will 
strenuously object to any characterization of Nicole Brown 
Simpson as a "battered wife", or any description of 
incidents as "spousal abuse" or "stalker" when referring to 
the defendant. These terms have acquired a strong secondary 
meaning which itself will have a dramatic prejudicial 
impact. Even if these isolated and widely separated 
incidents are admitted, they do not establish any sort of 
pattern of conduct. The use of prejudicial and misleading 
terminology to inflame a jury has achieved greater judicial 
scrutiny in an era when media "spin" attaches a great deal 
of inflammatory baggage to catch phrases. Hence, pursuant 
to California Evidence Code, Section 352, defendant moves 
this Court to preclude the utilization of such terms. 
 
2. THE USE OF "PROFILE" WITNESSES IS BOTH IMPROPER AND 
ULTIMATELY UNSCIENTIFIC AND SHOULD THEREFORE BE PRECLUDED. 
 
It is anticipated that the plaintiffs will attempt to call 
Donald Dutton, Ph.D. and Park Dietz, M.D. to opine that the 
killing of Nicole Brown Simpson was a "spousal homicide" 
and that the defendant was a "batterer" and-a "stalker".1/ 
Essentially, Dutton, a psychologist, and Dietz, a forensic 
psychologist, reach their opinions by "profiling" the 
defendant. Profiling involves the process of examining the 
circumstances of the killings, the relationship between the 
victim and alleged perpetrator, and comparing that scenario 
to other murders, victims and perpetrators. In theory, the 
object of this exercise is to see if the facts and 
circumstances fit the pattern or "profile" of a particular 
type of killing or killer. Profiling is used exclusively by 
law enforcement to assist in the investigation of unsolved 
crimes and has never been admitted by courts as evidence of 
the guilt of the defendant. A cursory examination of the 
deposition testimony of Dr. Dutton, shows this type of 
unreliable theorizing has no place in the courtroom. Dutton 
testified that Nicole Brown Simpson's murder was a "spousal 
homicide" because his review of police reports, statement 
of witnesses, and interviews with witnesses reveal that 
there was a history of the defendant abusing Nicole Brown 
Simpson. Dutton opined that the defendant had exhibited 
jealousy, that the weapon used was a knife, that the 
murders occurred at victim's home, that there were multiple 
wounds on the victims, and that the defendant and Nicole 
Brown Simpson had been recently estranged. Dutton conceded 
that there was no evidence of physical abuse after January 
1, 1989, and that much of the information relative to prior 
instances of abuse were uncorroborated hearsay which he 
could not rely on or would not place much weight on. Dutton 
also acknowledged that regarding the two occasions of 
alleged physical abuse, which was witnessed by more than 
one third party, he chose to ignore the witness who denied 
any abuse. 
 
Dutton also conceded that the use of the knife, multiple 
wounds, and the location of the killings were consistent 
with a non-spousal homicide. Significantly, Dutton 
testified that studies demonstrate that only 01 percent of 
batterers go on to kill their wives. 
 
Finally, and most importantly, Dutton admitted that the 
process he used to reach his opinion was not subject to any 
standards, and that there was no way to measure the 
accuracy of his findings.2/ He testified that he was sure 
of his opinion based on a "hunch". (Defendant does not have 
a final version of Dr. Dietz' deposition at the time of the 
writing of this Motion and will provide such at the Court's 
request.) 
 
This type of pseudo-scientific analysis whose accuracy is 
based on the practitioner's unverifiable and untested 
"hunch", does not come close to satisfy the stated 
requirements outlined in People v. Kelly [Kelly-Frye] 
(1976)17 Cal.3d 24 and their progeny. A scientific 
technique utilized by an expert witness must "be 
sufficiently established to have gained general acceptance 
in the particular field in which it belongs". Id. Courts in 
California and other jurisdictions have recognized this and 
consistently ruled that this type of expert opinion is 
inadmissible. For example, in People v. Bowler 203 
Cal.App.3d 385, the court held that the reliance on an 
expert's opinion that a child had been sexually molested, 
became the victim and the circumstances fit the pattern of 
"Child Sexual Abuse Accommodation Syndrome -CSAAS" was in 
error. Id. at 393. Relying on the California Supreme 
Court's decision in People v. Bledsoe (1984) 36 Cal.3d 236, 
the court in Bowler concluded that it was improper to use 
evidence of CSAAS "as predictor of child abuse". Id. at 
393. The court went on to point out that: 
 
 
"While the impropriety in [the admission of this type of 
evidence] is clearest where the expert's testimony applies 
the CSAAS theory to the facts of the case and concludes 
that the victim was molested, it is also present where the 
expert gives 'general' testimony describing the components 
of the syndrome in such a way as to allow the jury to apply 
the syndrome to the facts of the case and conclude the 
child was sexually abused. In fact, there may be more 
danger where the application is left for the jury because 
juror's education and training may not have sensitized them 
to the dangers of drawing predictive conclusions." Id. 
 
 
The risk that the jury will be unduly influenced and unable 
to independently evaluate the expert's opinion is greatly 
enhanced with this type of analysis because it is not 
"sufficiently susceptible to adequate cross-examination" as 
it is based on the expert's interpretation of 
non-standardized data. State v. Cavaliere, 140 N.H. 108, 
633 A.2d 96, 100 (S.Ct. N.H. 1995).3/ 
 
In summary, the testimony of Dr. Dietz and Dr. Dutton and 
any argument or inference to the defendant as a "batterer" 
or "stalker", or to the killing of Nicole Brown Simpson as 
a "spousal homicide" is patently improper and inadmissible 
and will unduly prejudice the defendant. 
 
3. CONCLUSION. 
 
Based on the foregoing, it is respectfully requested that 
this Court preclude any and all references by plaintiffs 
and/or plaintiffs' Attorneys from the characterization of 
incidents as "battering" or "stalking" and to preclude the 
utilization of profile witnesses.

ENDNOTES 
 
1/ As of this writing, the defendant has not yet deposed 
Dr. Dietz. 
 
2/ Dutton said that the only attempt he made to evaluate 
the accuracy of his opinions was to speak informally with 
some his colleagues, who had "heard" about the Simpson 
case. He admitted that this was not a scientifically 
accepted method of verification. 
 
3/ In Cavaliere, the New Hampshire Supreme Court was 
examining the admissibility of psychological expert 
testimony as to a sexual offender profile: 
 
"This (is) so because the experts opinion depended not on 
any one indicator or symptom, but rather on her 
interpretation of all the factors and information before 
her...An expert using this methodology may candidly 
acknowledge any inconsistencies or potential shortcomings 
in the individual pieces of evidence she presents, but can 
easily dismiss the critique by saying that her evaluation 
relies on no one symptom or indicator and that her 
conclusions still hold true in light of all the other 
available factors and her expertise in the field. Id., at 
100.

inadmissible); State v. Parkinson 909 P.2d 647, 652 (Idaho

Nicole Brown Simpson's alleged statement to police on New Year's Eve in 1989 that O.J. 
Simpson was "going to kill her" is inadmissible because it is not part of the official police 
record, defense lawyers maintain. They argue that statements not on the official record 
can only be entered if they are made spontaneously to the police. "There is no indication 
that any of Brown's  . . . statements to the police were blurted out spontaneously; rather, 
she was responding to questioning and was not so traumatized, or in physical distress, 
that she was unable to reflect on the statements that she made," according to this Aug. 26, 
1996 motion.

BAKER, SILBERBERG 8 KEENER 
 
By /s/ 
ROBERT C. BAKER 
Attorneys for Defendant 
ORENTHAL JAMES SIMPSON 
 
 
MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES 
 
1. INTRODUCTION. 
 
The plaintiffs may attempt to introduce police documents 
purportedly reporting statements made by Brown or others 
relating to Simpson. Brown's statements to the police, even 
if contained within an official police report, or a letter 
such as that authored by Detective Mark Fuhrman four years 
after the events purportedly being described, are hearsay 
and are inadmissible. 
 
2. ANY OUT-OF-COURT STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN POLICE REPORTS 
ARE INADMISSIBLE HEARSAY. 
 
Police reports may qualify as an exception to the hearsay 
rule pursuant to Section 1280 of the Evidence Code,1/ 
provided certain foundational requirements are met. 
Statements made by others to a police officer included 
within a police report constitute hearsay within hearsay 
and are not covered by "official records" exception to the 
hearsay rule.2/ This is because an "official record" is 
admissible only if the "sources of information and method 
of time of preparation were such as to indicate its 
trustworthiness." California Evidence Code, Section 
1280(c). Police officers reporting their own observations 
pursuant to an official duty to make accurate statements 
are presumed to be reliable. But, as the California Courts 
have repeatedly recognized, statements made by others to 
police officers are often made with ulterior motives and 
lack of guarantee of trustworthiness.3/ 
 
In People v. Baeske (1976) 58 Cal.App.3d 775, 130 Cal.Rptr. 
35, for example, the court affirmed a lower court's 
exclusion of a police report that contained the statement 
of a witness to the crime since information was provided by 
a citizen who had no particular duty to report accurately 
on the facts observed. As the court explained, "the 
trustworthiness requirement for this exception to the 
hearsay rule is established by a showing that the written 
report is based upon the observations of public employees 
who have a duty to observe the facts and report and record 
them correctly". Id. at 780. See also, Jackson v. 
Department of Motor Vehicles (1994) 22 Cal.App.4th 730, 
736, 27 Cal.Rptr. 2d 712 (Section 1280) which authorizes 
the introduction of only such portion of police records 
that report the police officer's "firsthand observations"); 
People v. De La Plane (1979) 88 Cal.App.3d 223,151 
Cal.Rptr. 843 (police tape recordings admissible to prove 
time calls were made but not to prove truth of the 
statements made by citizens making the calls, including 
identification of defendant). 
 
Statements made by Brown to police officers are not 
admissible pursuant to Section 1280 simply because they may 
be contained in a document that could be introduced into 
evidence were it to contain observations made by a police 
officer during the course of his official duties. 
Consequently, those statements can only be admitted if they 
fall within another recognized exception to the hearsay 
rule. Clearly, they do not. 
 
Any statement Brown may have made to the police expressing 
purported fear of Simpson or reporting that he had 
threatened her in some fashion is not admissible pursuant 
to Section 1250 as evidence of Brown's state of mind since 
her state of mind is not an issue in this action. 
 
Nor are such statements admissible as so-called 
"spontaneous statements" pursuant to Section 1240. For a 
statement to be admitted pursuant to this section it must 
describe an event or explain an act or condition perceived 
by the declarant and "must be made spontaneously, while the 
declarant is under the stress of the excitement caused by 
the perception". People v. Farmer (1989) 47 Cal.3d 888, 
900, 765 P.2d at 949, 254 Cal.Rptr. at 517.[4/] It is 
presumed to be trustworthy because it is made while the 
declarant is under the stress of nervous excitement and 
before he has had time to reflect or contrive. Id. 
 
While there is no set time limit within which a so-called 
"spontaneous statement" must be made, the courts have 
allowed in statements made after the triggering event only 
when the declarant has suffered serious trauma and is 
plainly in substantial pain or shock. Under such 
circumstances, the victim is not likely to have had the 
wherewithal to manufacture a false statement. See. e.a., 
People v. Raley (1992) 2 Cal.4th 870, 830 P.2d 712, 8 
Cal.Rptr. 2d 678 (although statement was made 18 hours 
after sexual assault, victim had been left bleeding, had 
suffered traumatic head injury, had been unconscious, and 
was close to death); People v. Farmer, supra, (statements 
by shooting victim, bleeding and in obvious pain, 
responding to police questioning); People v. Poggi, supra, 
(statement by stabbing victim bleeding profusely from 
ultimately fatal wounds 30 minutes after attack); People v. 
Washington (1969) 71 Cal.2d 1170, 459 P.2d 259, 81 
Cal.Rptr. 5 (statement by victim of robbery and assault in 
hospital about 45 minutes after attack during which time 
the victim lapsed in and out of consciousness). 
 
Moreover, even if an out-of-court statement is made 
spontaneously and while the witness is under the stress of 
excitement, portions of the statement may be excludable if 
they constitute inadmissible opinion testimony by the 
declarant. For example, in People v. Miron (1989) 210 
Cal.App.3d 580, 258 Cal.Rptr. 494, a witness testified that 
his employee had called him shortly after a shooting 
screaming about what had happened and repeating, "He was 
trying to kill us". The court held that the employee's 
observations were admissible as spontaneous statements but 
that the trial court had properly excluded the portion of 
her statement attributing to the intruder a motive to kill. 
As the court explained, the employee's conclusion that the 
man was trying to kill them was an opinion that would have 
been excludable because testified to by another since "the 
spontaneous statement exception to the hearsay rule cannot 
be used to bootstrap admissibility". 210 Cal.App.3d at 584, 
258 Cal.Rptr. at 495. 
 
The statements given by Brown to the police after the 
October 25, 1993 incident were not "spontaneous". As the 
reports indicate, Simpson was visiting Brown at her home 
earlier in the evening and they began to argue about 
photographs each one had of individuals with whom they had 
apparently been romantically involved. Simpson left and 
telephoned Brown. When she would not take his calls, he 
resumed to Brown's home, and when she refused him entry, he 
allegedly kicked in the door. Brown was unharmed. 
 
This incident is radically different from those where the 
courts have permitted statements to be introduced that were 
made after the so-called stressful event. Brown was not 
injured nor in shock. By the time the police responded to 
Brown's 911 call and took her statement, she had ample time 
to reflect on what she wanted to say. Her statements to the 
police were not made impulsively while under the stress of 
a highly traumatic event and bear no indicia of 
trustworthiness. 
 
Finally, the same reasoning applies to statements made by 
Brown to the police concerning the incident that took place 
on New Year's Eve, 1989. Brown and Simpson apparently had 
been drinking heavily that evening, which makes 
presumptively unreliable anything either party said later 
that night. The police arrived after the incident. Brown 
was upset when she spoke with them, but her physical 
injuries were minor. Brown's alleged accusation that 
Simpson was "going to kill her" is inadmissible opinion 
testimony that, as the Miron court made clear, cannot be 
bootstrapped into admissible evidence through the 
spontaneous statement exception to the hearsay rule. 
Further, there is no indication that any of Brown's other 
statements to the police were blurted out spontaneously; 
rather, she was responding to questioning and she certainly 
was not so traumatized, or in such physical distress, that 
she was unable to reflect on the statements that she made. 
 
3. CONCLUSION. 
 
Based on the foregoing, it is respectfully requested that 
this Court preclude any and all references by plaintiffs 
and/or plaintiffs' Attorneys regarding any out-of-court 
statements contained in Police Reports as they are 
irrelevant hearsay.

ENDNOTES 
 
1/ Section 1280, the hearsay exception for a "record by [a] 
public employee" provides as follows: 
 
Evidence of a writing made as a record of an act, 
condition, or event is not made inadmissible by the hearsay 
rule when offered to prove the act, condition, or event if 
 
(a) The writing was made by and within the scope of duty of 
a public employee; 
(b) The writing was made at or near the time of the act, 
condition, or event; 
(c) The sources of information and method and time of 
preparation were such as to indicate its trustworthiness. 
 
2/ Section 1201 of the Evidence Code, addressing "multiple 
hearsay" recognizes that hearsay statements contained 
within hearsay statements must "meet the requirements of an 
exception to the hearsay rule. 
 
3/ For the same reason, police reports are not admissible 
under the "business records" exception to the hearsay rule, 
California Evidence Code, Section 1271, to the extent they 
include narrations by persons under no business duty to 
report to the police. 
 
4/ "(1) [T]here must be some occurrence startling enough to 
produce...nervous excitement and render the utterance 
spontaneous and unreflecting; (2) the utterance must have 
been before there has been time to contrive and 
misrepresent, e.g., while the nervous excitement may be 
supposed still to dominate and the reflective powers to be 
yet in abeyance; and (3) the utterance must relate to the 
circumstance of the occurrence preceding it." People v. 
Poggi (1988) 45 Cal.2d 306, 318, 253 P.2d 1082, 246 
Cal.Rptr. 886.

<P>
In this Aug. 26, 1996 pretrial motion, defense lawyers ask that the plaintiffs be barred 
from introducing evidence concerning O.J. Simpson's financial condition. They say that 
such evidence is prejudicial and irrelevant until the plaintiffs prove Simpson is liable for 
punitive damages.

LOUIS H. BROWN, etc., 
 
Plaintiff, 
 
vs. 
 
ORENTHAL JAMES SIMPSON, 
 
Defendant. 
 
 
TO ALL PARTIES AND TO THEIR ATTORNEYS OF RECORD: 
 
Defendant, ORENTHAL JAMES SIMPSON, hereby moves this Court 
for an Order instructing plaintiffs and their counsel not 
to refer to, interrogate any witness concerning, comment 
on, or attempt to suggest to the jury in any way, any 
information concerning the financial condition of the 
defendant until such time as plaintiffs have produced 
evidence of a prima facie case of liability for damages 
pursuant to California Civil Code, Section 3294. 
 
This Motion is made on the grounds that as a maker of law, 
pursuant to California Civil Code, Section 3295, plaintiffs 
may not introduce evidence concerning the defendant's 
profits or financial condition until after the trier of 
fact returns a verdict for plaintiffs awarding actual 
damages, and finds the defendant guilty of malice, 
oppression, or fraud, in accordance with Section 3294. 
 
This Motion is based upon the Memorandum of Points and 
Authorities attached hereto, on the papers and records on 
file herein, and on such oral and documentary evidence as 
may be presented at the hearing of this Motion. 
 
DATED: August 20, 1996 
 
BAKER, SILBERBERG & KEENER 
 
By /s/ 
ROBERT C. BAKER 
Attorneys for Defendant 
ORENTHAL JAMES SIMPSON 
 
 
MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES 
 
1. STATEMENT OF FACTS. 
 
In their prayer for damages, plaintiffs seek to recover 
punitive damages. It is anticipated at the Trial of this 
action plaintiffs will attempt to introduce evidence 
concerning the worth and financial condition of defendant, 
ORENTHAL JAMES SIMPSON. Evidence concerning defendant's 
worth and financial condition will be irrelevant to this 
action until such time as plaintiffs have produced evidence 
of a prima facie case of liability for punitive damages. 
Additionally, prior to that time, if this ever occurs, 
defendant contends that the probative value of such 
evidence is substantially outweighed by the probability 
that its admission will create substantial danger of undue 
prejudice to this moving defendant. Moreover, plaintiffs 
should be precluded from presenting such evidence pursuant 
to California Civil Code, Section 3295. 
 
2. THE COURT MAY GRANT A PROTECTIVE ORDER REQUIRING 
PLAINTIFFS TO PRODUCE EVIDENCE OF A PRIMA FACIE CASE OF 
LIABILITY FOR PUNITIVE DAMAGES PRIOR TO INTRODUCING 
EVIDENCE OF FINANCIAL CONDITION OR PROFITS. 
 
 
California Civil Code, Section 3295 states in pertinent 
part as follows: "(a) The court may, for good cause, grant 
any defendant a protective order requiring the plaintiff to 
produce evidence of a prima facie case of liability for 
damages pursuant to Section 3294, prior to the introduction 
of evidence of: (1 ) The profits the defendant has gained 
by virtue of the wrongful course of conduct of the nature 
and type shown by the evidence. (2) The financial condition 
of the defendant." 
 
 
Pursuant to Section 3295 above, this Court has the power to 
grant the protective order requested herein. Plaintiffs 
should not be allowed to discuss the financial condition or 
worth of defendant until after the trier of fact returns a 
verdict for plaintiffs, awarding actual damages, and finds 
the defendant guilty of malice, oppression, or fraud in 
accordance with Section 3294, should such an event ever 
even occur. 
 
3. THE NET WORTH OR FINANCIAL CONDITION OF DEFENDANT IS 
IRRELEVANT. 
 
As stated above, plaintiffs should not be allowed to 
comment on the net worth or financial condition of 
defendant until such time, if ever, plaintiffs produce 
evidence of liability for punitive damages. It is highly 
unlikely that plaintiffs will be able to do this at the 
Trial of this action. Accordingly, evidence concerning the 
net worth or financial condition of defendant is irrelevant 
to this action. California Evidence Code, Section 350 
states that "no evidence is admissible except relevant 
evidence". Accordingly, in the event that plaintiffs cannot 
produce evidence of liability for punitive damages on the 
part of this moving defendant, evidence concerning 
defendant's net worth or financial condition is 
inadmissible in this action pursuant to Section 350. 
 
4. THE PROBATIVE VALUE OF EVIDENCE CONCERNING DEFENDANTS 
FINANCIAL CONDITION IS SUBSTANTIALLY OUTWEIGHED BY THE 
PROBABILITY THAT ITS ADMISSION WILL CREATE DANGER OF UNDUE 
PREJUDICE TO DEFENDANT. 
 
 
California Evidence Code, Section 352 states as follows: 
"The court in its discretion may exclude evidence if its 
probative value is substantially outweighed by the 
probability that its admission will (a) necessitate undue 
consumption of time, or (b) create substantial danger of 
undue prejudice, of confusing the issues, or of misleading 
the jury." 
 
 
As stated above, it is unlikely that plaintiffs will be 
able to produce evidence of liability for punitive damages 
on the part of moving defendant. Hence, plaintiffs should 
be prohibited from introducing evidence concerning the 
financial condition of defendant pursuant to Civil Code, 
Section 3295, set out above. Additionally, defendant 
contends that the probative value of evidence concerning 
the defendant's net worth or financial condition is 
substantially outweighed by the probability that its 
admission will create substantial danger of undue prejudice 
against the defendant. Accordingly, such evidence should be 
excluded at the Trial of this action. 
 
5. CONCLUSION. 
 
In light of the foregoing, defendant respectfully requests 
that this Court Order plaintiffs and their counsel, not to 
refer to, interrogate any witness concerning, comment on, 
or attempt to suggest to the jury in any way, any facts 
concerning the net worth or financial condition of 
defendant, ORENTHAL JAMES SIMPSON, until such time, if 
ever, plaintiffs produce evidence of a prima facie case of 
liability for damages pursuant to California Civil Code, 
Section 3294.

MOTIONS IN LIMINE OF PLAINTIFF 
FREDRIC GOLDMAN TO PRECLUDE 
ARGUMENT AND QUESTIONING 
REGARDING PLANTING OF 
EVIDENCE 
 
Trial Date: September 17, 1996 
 
 
RE GOLDMAN MOTIONS NOS. 1-7 
 
 
DECLARATION OF DANIEL M. PETROCELLI 
 
I, DANIEL M. PETROCELLI, declare: 
 
1. I am an attorney at law licensed to practice before all 
of the courts of the State of California. My professional 
corporation is a partner in the law firm of Mitchell, 
Silberberg & Knupp LLP, counsel for Fredric Goldman in this 
action. I have personal knowledge of all of the following 
facts and, if called as a witness, could and would 
competently testify thereto. 
 
2. The purpose of this declaration is to summarize in a 
convenient format the interrogatory responses of defendant 
Orenthal James Simpson that are relevant to Goldman's 
motion in limine to exclude evidence that blood evidence 
was planted. All of the answers relevant to this motion are 
in response to Goldman's First Set of Special 
interrogatories. A true and correct copy of that document 
is attached as Exhibit 1. Simpson's answers are taken from 
his Further Responses to these interrogatories that were 
served on or about July 25, 1996. (The original responses 
contained only objections.) A true and correct copy of that 
document is attached hereto as Exhibit 2. These documents 
are attached solely so the Court can verify that this 
declaration accurately summarizes and quotes the relevant 
interrogatories and responses. 
 
3. The Bundy blood trail [LAPD evidence item numbers 47, 
48, 49, 50, and 52]. Special Interrogatories 1 through 6 
sought information regarding Simpson's contention that this 
evidence "consisted, in whole or in part, of PLANTED 
EVIDENCE." Interrogatories 2 and 5 specifically asked 
Simpson to "set forth in detail all facts" that supported 
any such contention. Simpson's response to interrogatory 2, 
which he incorporated by reference into his response to 
Interrogatory 5, is as follows: 
 
 
"As to this and all other interrogatories, it is the 
Defense contention that the manner of collection, storing, 
processing, and testing of this and all forensic evidence 
was such that reasonable inferences can be drawn that this 
and other evidence was planted as defined by Plaintiff or 
contaminated, either accidentally or intentionally, at some 
time after collection. 
 
"Testimony was elicited regarding the manner of collection, 
storing, processing, and testing of the evidence in this 
case a the criminal trial, the grand jury hearings 
beginning on June 1 1994, the preliminary hearing beginning 
on July 1, 1994, the motion for a split of the forensic 
samples beginning on August 1994, and the motion to 
suppress hearing beginning on September 21, 1994. 
 
"All testimony regarding the manner of collection, storing, 
processing, and testing of the evidence in this case as 
well as all testimony concerning the proper manner of 
collection, storing processing, and testing of forensic 
evidence such as was found this case, is relevant to the 
integrity of each piece of evidence which was collected at 
each of the crime scenes. 
 
"Counsel is further directed to the closing arguments of 
Mr. Cochran (RT 47607,19, and following, 9/27/94) and Mr. 
Scheck (RT 47852,6 and following, 9/28/94) which contain 
specific references to facts in the record of the criminal 
trial which support the Defense answer to this 
interrogatory and all other interrogatories regarding the 
physical evidence in this case. 
 
"Additionally, the following is a listing of the witnesses 
who presented testimony relevant to the manner of 
collection, storing, processing, and testing of the 
evidence in this case as well as the proper manner of 
collection, storing, processing, and testing, with the name 
of the proceeding, and the page and line number [if 
available] where the witness's testimony begins concerning 
these issues.

4. The Bundy back gate blood [LAPD evidence item numbers 
115, 116, and 1171. Special Interrogatories 7 through 15 
sought information about Simpson's contention that this 
evidence "consisted, in whole or in part, of PLANTED 
EVIDENCE." Interrogatories 8,11, and 14 specifically asked 
Simpson to "set forth in detail all facts" that supported 
any such contention. Simpson's response to Interrogatory 8, 
which he incorporated by reference into his responses to 
Interrogatories 11 and 14, is as follows: 
 
 
"See answer to Interrogatory No. 2. In addition, this item 
was not observed on June 13,1994 by any of the criminalists 
assigned to examine and process the crime scene. This item 
was not referred to in any police reports from officers 
observing the Bundy crime scene on June 13. This item was 
not seen by Rolf Baur after June 13, 1994 when he washed 
down the Bundy crime scene. Item No. 115 was not collected 
until three weeks after the homicide. Item No. 115 
contained amounts of DNA more consistent with a fresh drop, 
than one which had been subjected to the elements for three 
weeks. L.A.P.D. Item No. 117 which was allegedly found at 
the same time as No. 115 was tested by the Federal Bureau 
of Investigation and was determined to contain the blood 
preservative EDTA. Pictures taken by the Los Angeles Police 
Department on June 13,1994 do not show the presence of Item 
Nos. 115, 116 and 117." 
 
 
5. The Bronco blood collected on June 14, 1994 [LAPD 
evidence item numbers 23, 24, 25, 29, 30, 31, and 341. 
Special Interrogatories 16 through 30 sought information 
about Simpson's contention that this evidence "consisted, 
in whole or in part, of PLANTED EVIDENCE." Interrogatories 
17, 20, 23, 26, and 29 specifically asked Simpson to "set 
forth in detail all facts" that supported any such 
contention. Simpson's response to Interrogatory 17, which 
he incorporated by reference into his responses to 
Interrogatories 20, 23, 26, and 29, is as follows: 
 
 
"See answer to Interrogatory No. 2 with the additional 
information that the Bronco was never secured at the 
Rockingham scene. It was kept in the street for any members 
of the media or bystanders could have access to it. It was 
towed to an unsecured facility prior to the time Item No. 
24 was collected." 
 
 
6. The Bronco blood collected on September 1, 1994 [LAPD 
evidence item numbers 293, 303, 304, and 305]. Special 
Interrogatories 31 through 42 sought information about 
Simpson's contention that this evidence "consisted, in 
whole or in part, of PLANTED EVIDENCE." Interrogatories 32, 
35, 38, and 41 specifically asked Simpson to "set forth in 
detail all facts" that supported any such contention. 
Simpson's response to Interrogatory 32, which he 
incorporated by reference into his responses to 
Interrogatories 35, 38, and 41 is as follows: 
 
 
"See answer to Interrogatory Nos. 2 and 17 with the 
additional information that between June 13 and August 2, 
when Item No. 293 was collected, the Ford Bronco was kept 
in an unsecured facility with access by many different 
people both in law enforcement and out of law enforcement. 
In fact, the Bronco was examined by William Blasini, Jr. 
during that period of time (RT 43971,1). Mr. Blasini is 
specifically trained to look.for such things as stains 
inside a car. He saw no stains consistent with blood." 
 
 
7. The Rockingham glove [People's-Exhibit number 77]- 
Special Interrogatories 67 through 69 sought information 
about Simpson's contention that this evidence "consisted, 
in whole or in part, of PLANTED EVIDENCE." Interrogatory 68 
specifically asked Simpson to "set forth in detail all 
facts" that supported any such contention. Simpson's 
response to Interrogatory 68 is as follows: 
 
 
"See answer to Interrogatory No. 2. Additionally, there was 
no blood trail leading to where Exhibit 164(a) was found. 
It appeared to be moist when it was found in the morning. 
It did not have any dirt, plant material, cobwebs, or other 
indicia that it had been at that location for a lengthy 
period of time. There was no evidence of blood on the 
ground under the glove. There was no evidence that anyone 
could have or did climb over the fence in the area where 
the item was found. 
 
 
8. The Rockingham blood trail [LAPD evidence item numbers 
5, 6, 7, 8,12, and 141. Special Interrogatories 43 through 
51 and 61 through 63 sought information about Simpson's 
contention that this evidence "consisted, in whole or in 
part, of PLANTED EVIDENCE." Interrogatories 44, 47, 50, and 
62 specifically asked Simpson to "set forth in detail all 
facts" that supported any such contention. Simpson's 
response to Interrogatory 44, which he incorporated by 
reference into his responses to Interrogatories 47, 50, and 
62, is as follows. 
 
 
"See answer to Interrogatory No. 2. Additionally, counsel 
is referred to their own deposition of Mr. Simpson in this 
matter where he was repeatedly questioned and repeatedly 
gave answers concerning explanations of how his blood might 
be found at his own house." 
 
 
9. The Rockingham socks [LAPD evidence item numbers 13,13A, 
13B, and 13C]. Special Interrogatories 52 through 60 sought 
information about Simpson's contention that this evidence 
"consisted, in whole or in part, of PLANTED EVIDENCE." 
Interrogatories 53, 56, and 59 specifically asked Simpson 
to "set forth in detail all facts" that supported any such 
contention. Simpson's response to Interrogatory 53, which 
he incorporated by reference into his responses to 
Interrogatories 56 and 59, is as follows: 
 
 
"See answer to Interrogatory Nos. 2 and 8. Additionally, a 
comparison of criminalist Fung and Mazzola's notes as to 
the collection of Item No. 13 compared with testimony from 
the police videographer, compared to still photographs 
taken by the police show that Item No. 13 was not present 
on Mr. Simpson's bedroom floor immediately prior to the 
time it was photographed and collected from Mr. Simpson's 
floor. Item No. 13 was examined several times between the 
time of collection and early August of 1994 when blood was 
purportedly first observed. No blood was observed at any of 
the inspections prior to the August 1994 inspection. 
Examination of Item No. 13 revealed evidence that a large 
bloodstain attributable to Nicole Brown.Simpson was placed 
on the sock at a time other than when it was being worn. 
(See testimony of Dr. McDonnell as referred to in answer 
No. 2.) The Federal Bureau of Investigation also found 
evidence of presence of the blood preservative EDTA in the 
bloodstain believed to be Nicole Brown Simpson's blood. 
(See testimony of Roger Martz and Dr. Rieders as referred 
to in answer to No. 1)." 
 
 
I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the 
State of California that the foregoing is true and correct. 
Executed on August 26, 1996 at Los Angeles, California.

Trial Date: 09/17/96 
Motion Cutoff: 08/26/96 
 
 
The plaintiff, Estate of Nicole Brown Simpson, respectfully moves 
to exclude certain evidence which the plaintiff believes defendant 
Simpson will offer at the time of trial. The evidence in question 
is irrelevant, non probative, misleading and inflammatory. 
 
The court should issue an order in limine to instruct 
defendant's attorney and witnesses as follows: 
 
Defendant's attorney and witnesses are directed not to 
introduce, suggest, refer to, or comment on, either directly or 
indirectly, during voir dire, or before the jury regarding the 
allegation that defendant Simpson acted with generosity and 
benevolence in allegedly contributing financial support and 
assistance to member of the Brown family, including Louis Brown, 
Juditha Brown, Denise Brown, Dominique Brown, Tanya Brown and 
Rolph Bauer.

MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES 
 
I. 
 
PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 
 
By this motion, the plaintiff Estate of Nicole Brown Simpson 
seeks to exclude argument or evidence relating to any financial 
support or assistance the defendant Orenthal James Simpson 
allegedly gave to the family of the decedent Nicole Brown Simpson 
in the years preceding Nicole Brown Simpson's brutal murder. 
Whether or not defendant Simpson rendered financial assistance 
to the family of his slain ex-wife is patently collateral and 
irrelevant to the issues of this trial. Any evidence of this 
nature must be excluded under Cal. Evid. Code. Sec. 352. 
 
II. 
 
ANY EVIDENCE, WHETHER DIRECT OR INTRODUCED ON 
CROSS- EXAMINATION, REGARDING ANY FINANCIAL 
SUPPORT O.J. SIMPSON GAVE TO THE BROWN FAMILY 
MUST BE EXCLUDED AT THE TIME OF TRIAL. 
 
The plaintiff Estate of Nicole Brown Simpson anticipates that the 
defendant Simpson may attempt to argue or introduce evidence at 
trial showing his alleged financial support of the family of 
Nicole Brown Simpson. Questions pertaining to this subject area 
occurred at various depositions in this case. In addition, during 
Mr. Simpson's criminal trial repeated references to this subject 
area were made by counsel to defendant Simpson in both opening 
and closing statements, with no evidence presented to support 
same. 
 
It is foreseeable that the defense may attempt to introduce 
this financial assistance evidence under the guise of impeaching 
the credibility of the Brown family members when they testify at 
trial. 
 
In fact evidence tending to prove Mr. Simpson's alleged 
benevolence or generosity to Brown family members would have 
no "impeachment" value whatsoever. The contrary is true. If 
assertions regarding this "generosity" were true, family members 
would be motivated to support Mr. Simpson's claim of innocence in 
order to insure a continuity of financial support and benevolence. 
 
The true reason that such evidence may be offered by Mr. 
Simpson's counsel is to improperly bolster Mr. Simpson's 
character and stature in the eyes of the jury. 
 
The introduction of this subject area by the defendant Simpson 
will unnecessarily prolong the trial. The Estate of Nicole Brown 
Simpson will be forced to contest Mr. Simpson's claim of 
generosity and benevolence thereby creating a "trial within a 
trial" on this issue. This will generate confusion and draw the 
jury's attention away from the true issue at bar: the brutal 
murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman. 
 
III. 
 
STATEMENT OF LAW 
 
It is completely within the court's discretion to prevent the 
defense from arguing or introducing evidence regarding the alleged 
generosity and benevolence of defendant Simpson in contributing 
financial support and assistance to members of the Brown family 
and to prevent defense counsel from inquiring into these matters 
on cross examination. Cal. Code of Evidence Sec. 352; Kessler v. 
Gray, 77 Cal.App.3d 284; People v. Hess, 104 Cal.App.2d 642. 
People v. Rodrigues, 36 Cal.Rptr.2d 235. In using its discretion, 
the trial court must balance the probative value of the evidence 
against the prejudicial effect of introducing that evidence. The 
court must also consider whether the evidence will confuse the 
issue or mislead the jury. Cal. Code of Evidence Sec. 352. It is 
respectfully submitted that these claims regarding defendant 
Simpson's alleged generosity and benevolence, whether argued or 
introduced directly or in cross examination, fail every one of 
the determinative criteria regarding admissibility. 
 
The allegation that defendant Simpson was generous has nothing 
to do with the substantive issues of this lawsuit. In addition, 
introduction of this issue may have a prejudicial impact on the 
jury. 
 
Accordingly, the court should also exclude all reference to the 
Nicole Brown Simpson Charitable Foundation on the grounds that 
activities pertaining to the foundation are irrelevant and 
collateral to the issues presented in this litigation. 
 
This alleged evidence is entirely irrelevant to the assessment 
of issues in this case. No members of the Brown family are 
individual plaintiffs in this litigation. The action has been 
brought by the Estate of Nicole Brown Simpson and the only 
beneficiaries of that estate are Nicole Brown Simpson's children, 
Sydney and Justin Simpson. 
 
The introduction of this collateral material would lead the 
jury's attention away from the real facts at issue in this case 
rather than assist them in the search for the truth. At no time 
during this trial should the jury be called to pass judgment on 
the family of the slain plaintiff. The jury must not be led 
astray from the inquiry into whether the defendant Simpson is 
liable for the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald 
Goldman. 
 
Finally, this trial will produce a tremendous amount of 
evidence for the jury to digest. For the defense to contribute 
additional argument or evidence that has no bearing on the facts 
at issue would be unduly time consuming and wasteful of the 
court's limited time. As such, not only must the evidence be 
excluded on relevance grounds, but also on the grounds that it 
would unnecessarily prolong the trial.

MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES 
 
I. 
 
PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 
 
In the aftermath of the brutal slaying of Nicole Brown Simpson, 
the Nicole Brown Simpson Charitable Foundation was formed 
to assist battered women throughout the United States. Certain 
members of the Brown family, including Louis Brown, Juditha 
Brown, Denise Brown, and Dominique Brown serve as officers of 
this charitable foundation. 
 
During depositions and discovery proceedings in this case counsel 
to defendant Simpson have repeatedly directed questions and 
inquiries to members of the Brown family regarding this charitable 
foundation. These repeated attempts to obtain information 
regarding the Foundation suggests that defendant Simpson intends 
to improperly interject issues concerning the foundation into the 
trial of this matter. 
 
The charitable foundation exists solely for the purpose of 
assisting battered women throughout the United States. No funds 
from the foundation have been used in connection with this 
lawsuit. As such, discussion of the foundation is irrelevant to 
the proceedings at bar. Issues pertaining to the foundation are 
entirely collateral. Should defendant raise such issues, plaintiff 
Estate of Nicole Brown Simpson would be compelled to offer 
evidence in rebuttal creating a "trial within a trial." This would 
unnecessarily prolong the trial of this case and distract the jury 
from the true issue at hand: the responsibility of defendant 
Simpson for the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald 
Goldman. The court should therefore prohibit all reference by 
the defense to the Nicole Brown Simpson Charitable Foundation. 
 
II. 
 
STATEMENT OF LAW 
 
It is completely within the court's discretion to prevent 
the defense from introducing evidence regarding the alleged the 
Nicole Brown Simpson Charitable Foundation and to prevent 
defense counsel from inquiring into matters pertaining to the 
Foundation on cross-examination. Cal. Code of Evidence Sec. 352; 
Kessler v. Gray, 77 Cal.App.3d 284; People v. Hess, 104 
Cal.App.2d 642, People v. Rodrigues, 36 Cal.Rptr.2d 235. In 
using its discretion, the trial court must balance the 
probative value of the evidence against the prejudicial effect 
of introducing that evidence. The court must also consider 
whether the evidence will confuse the issue or mislead the

Accordingly, the court should exclude all reference to the 
Nicole Brown Simpson Charitable Foundation on the grounds that 
activities pertaining to the foundation are irrelevant and

The plaintiff, Estate of Nicole Brown Simpson, respectfully 
moves to exclude certain evidence which the plaintiff believes 
defendant Simpson will offer at the time of trial. The evidence 
in question is irrelevant, non probative, misleading and 
inflammatory. 
 
The court should issue an order in limine to instruct 
defendant's attorney and witnesses as follows: 
 
Defendant's attorney and witnesses are directed not 
to introduce, suggest, refer to, or comment on, 
either directly or indirectly, during voir dire, or 
before the jury regarding the allegation that any 
member of the Brown family including Louis Brown, 
Juditha Brown, Denise Brown, Dominique Brown, Tanya 
Brown and Rolph Bauer sold or profited from the sale 
of any items, stories or materials related to Nicole 
Brown Simpson, Orenthal Simpson, or their children, 
Sydney and Justin. 
 
Dated: August 26, 1996 
 
/s/ 
John Quinlan Kelly, Esq. 
Attorneys for Plaintiff 
Estate of Nicole Brown Simpson 
 
 
 
MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES 
 
I. 
 
PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 
 
Based upon certain questions propounded by defense counsel at 
the deposition of certain Brown family members, the plaintiff, 
Estate- of Nicole Brown Simpson, has reason to believe that 
defendant Simpson will seek to introduce and utilize non- 
probative, misleading, inflammatory allegations and materials 
regarding various members of the Brown family. 
 
At the deposition of Dominique Brown, the younger sister of 
the deceased Nicole Brown Simpson, defendant Simpson's counsel 
asked the following questions: 
 
"Since your sister has been killed, have you 
received any income from the sale of 
photographs of Nicole . . ." 
 
"Have you sold photographs of Nicole to 
anybody?" 
 
Shortly after receiving answers to these questions, defendant's 
attorneys immediately contacted the national media and provided 
them detailed answers to same as an obvious attempt to slander 
and embarrass this witness. See Exhibit "A" hereto. 
 
These questions strongly suggest that at the trial of this 
matter, defendant Simpson will seek to introduce and utilize 
material and questions tending to suggest that members of the 
Brown family have profited from the sale of various items and 
materials relating to Nicole Brown Simpson, defendant Simpson 
and the children, Sydney and Justin Simpson. It is impossible to 
anticipate the number or specific kind of questions which may be 
propounded by defense counsel under the guise of "impeachment" or 
"attack on witnesses' credibility." A wealth of inaccurate, 
slanderous and scurrilous material regarding the Brown family has 
appeared in the tabloid press and in other media outlets since the 
murder of Nicole Brown Simpson. 
 
Should any of this type of material be brought to the 
attention of the jury, the prejudicial impact on the plaintiff 
estate's case will be substantial. The prejudice will exist even 
if a scandalous question is followed by a denial from the witness. 
 
In addition, the introduction of such scurrilous and 
collateral material will prolong the trial and distract the jury 
from the true issues at hand: the brutal murders of Nicole Brown 
Simpson and Ronald Goldman by defendant Simpson. If the door to 
this type of testimony is opened, the plaintiff estate of Nicole 
Brown Simpson will be required to reply with evidence regarding 
the family's efforts to insure the financial welfare and security 
of the children, Sydney and Justin. The estate may also be forced 
to contest through evidence the accuracy of defendant Simpson's 
assertions. 
 
II. 
 
STATEMENT OF LAW 
 
ANY EVIDENCE REGARDING THE SALE OF ITEMS, STORIES AND 
MATERIALS PERTAINING TO NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON, 
ORENTHAL 
JAMES SIMPSON, JUSTIN AND SYDNEY SIMPSON, FOR PROFIT BY 
MEMBERS OF THE BROWN FAMILY MUST BE EXCLUDED AT THE 
TIME 
OF TRIAL AND DEFENSE COUNSEL MUST BE PROHIBITED FROM 
ANY 
REFERENCE TO SAID MATERIAL. 
 
It is completely within the court's discretion to prevent the 
defense from arguing or introducing evidence regarding the alleged 
sale of the items, stories and materials noted above and to 
prevent defense counsel from inquiring into the alleged sale 
on cross-examination. Cal. Code of Evidence Sec. 352: Kessler v. 
Gray 77 Cal.App.3d 284; People v. Hess, 104 Cal.App.2d 642, 
People v. Rodrigues, 36 Cal.Rptr.2d 235. In using its discretion, 
the trial court must balance the probative value of the evidence 
against the prejudicial effect of introducing that evidence. 
The court must also consider whether the evidence will confuse 
the issue or mislead the jury. Cal. Code of Evidence Sec. 352. 
It is respectfully submitted that these "sale allegations", 
whether introduced directly or in cross-examination, fail every 
one of the determinative criteria regarding admissibility. 
 
First, the allegation that the Brown's may have sold 
items, stories or materials to the media has absolutely nothing 
to do with the substantive issues of this lawsuit. In addition, 
the prejudicial impact of making this allegation in front of 
the jury would be severe and may compel the Browns to produce 
evidence to disprove irrelevant allegations, thus prolonging 
the trial. 
 
This alleged evidence is entirely irrelevant to the 
assessment of witness credibility in this case. No members of 
the Brown family are individual plaintiffs in this litigation. 
The action has been brought by the Estate of Nicole Brown 
Simpson and the only beneficiaries of that estate are Nicole 
Brown Simpson's children, Sydney and Justin Simpson. 
 
Cross-examination is properly limited to prevent undue prejudice 
and to avoid the unnecessary consumption of time. The Court of 
Appeal has ruled that limiting the cross-examination of a witness 
regarding her relationship with the victim is proper when 
the purpose of that cross-examination would be to challenge the 
witness' credibility. People v. Barrow, 60 Cal.App.3d. 984. In 
that case, the Court of Appeal upheld the trial court's finding 
that testimony showing that the relationship between the witness 
and the decedent victim was less than "beautiful" was collateral, 
cumulative, and unduly prejudicial. The case before this court 
presents a similar situation. Malicious allegations by the defense 
with absolutely no probative bearing on this case should not be 
allowed to impeach the testimony of the Brown Family. 
 
Second, the introduction of this collateral material would lead 
the jury's attention away from the real facts at issue in this 
case rather than assist them in the search for the truth. At no 
time during this trial should the jury be called to pass judgment 
on the family of the slain plaintiff. The jury must not be led 
astray from the inquiry into whether the defendant Orenthal James 
Simpson is liable for the deaths of Nicole Brown Simpson and 
Ronald Goldman. 
 
Finally, this trial will produce a tremendous amount of evidence 
for the jury to digest. For the defense to contribute additional 
evidence that has no bearing on the facts at issue would be 
unduly time consuming and wasteful of the court's limited time. 
As such, not only must the evidence be excluded on relevance 
grounds, but also on the grounds that it would unnecessarily 
prolong the trial.

Motion Cutoff: 08/26/96 
 
 
The plaintiff, Estate of Nicole Brown Simpson, respectfully moves 
to exclude certain evidence which the plaintiff believes defendant 
Simpson will offer at the time of trial. The evidence in question 
is irrelevant, non probative, misleading and inflammatory. 
 
The court should issue an order in limine to instruct 
defendant's attorney and witnesses as follows: 
 
Defendant's attorney and witnesses are directed not to 
introduce, suggest, refer to, or comment on, either directly or 
indirectly, during voir dire, or before the jury regarding the 
allegation that defendant Simpson acted with generosity and 
benevolence in allegedly contributing financial support and 
assistance to member of the Brown family, including Louis Brown, 
Juditha Brown, Denise Brown, Dominique Brown, Tanya Brown and 
Rolph Bauer.

MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES 
 
I. 
 
PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 
 
By this motion, the plaintiff Estate of Nicole Brown Simpson 
seeks to exclude argument or evidence relating to any financial 
support or assistance the defendant Orenthal James Simpson 
allegedly gave to the family of the decedent Nicole Brown Simpson 
in the years preceding Nicole Brown Simpson's brutal murder. 
Whether or not defendant Simpson rendered financial assistance 
to the family of his slain ex-wife is patently collateral and 
irrelevant to the issues of this trial. Any evidence of this 
nature must be excluded under Cal. Evid. Code. Sec. 352. 
 
II. 
 
ANY EVIDENCE, WHETHER DIRECT OR INTRODUCED ON 
CROSS- EXAMINATION, REGARDING ANY FINANCIAL 
SUPPORT O.J. SIMPSON GAVE TO THE BROWN FAMILY 
MUST BE EXCLUDED AT THE TIME OF TRIAL. 
 
The plaintiff Estate of Nicole Brown Simpson anticipates that the 
defendant Simpson may attempt to argue or introduce evidence at 
trial showing his alleged financial support of the family of 
Nicole Brown Simpson. Questions pertaining to this subject area 
occurred at various depositions in this case. In addition, during 
Mr. Simpson's criminal trial repeated references to this subject 
area were made by counsel to defendant Simpson in both opening 
and closing statements, with no evidence presented to support 
same. 
 
It is foreseeable that the defense may attempt to introduce 
this financial assistance evidence under the guise of impeaching 
the credibility of the Brown family members when they testify at 
trial. 
 
In fact evidence tending to prove Mr. Simpson's alleged 
benevolence or generosity to Brown family members would have 
no "impeachment" value whatsoever. The contrary is true. If 
assertions regarding this "generosity" were true, family members 
would be motivated to support Mr. Simpson's claim of innocence in 
order to insure a continuity of financial support and benevolence. 
 
The true reason that such evidence may be offered by Mr. 
Simpson's counsel is to improperly bolster Mr. Simpson's 
character and stature in the eyes of the jury. 
 
The introduction of this subject area by the defendant Simpson 
will unnecessarily prolong the trial. The Estate of Nicole Brown 
Simpson will be forced to contest Mr. Simpson's claim of 
generosity and benevolence thereby creating a "trial within a 
trial" on this issue. This will generate confusion and draw the 
jury's attention away from the true issue at bar: the brutal 
murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman. 
 
III. 
 
STATEMENT OF LAW 
 
It is completely within the court's discretion to prevent the 
defense from arguing or introducing evidence regarding the alleged 
generosity and benevolence of defendant Simpson in contributing 
financial support and assistance to members of the Brown family 
and to prevent defense counsel from inquiring into these matters 
on cross examination. Cal. Code of Evidence Sec. 352; Kessler v. 
Gray, 77 Cal.App.3d 284; People v. Hess, 104 Cal.App.2d 642. 
People v. Rodrigues, 36 Cal.Rptr.2d 235. In using its discretion, 
the trial court must balance the probative value of the evidence 
against the prejudicial effect of introducing that evidence. The 
court must also consider whether the evidence will confuse the 
issue or mislead the jury. Cal. Code of Evidence Sec. 352. It is 
respectfully submitted that these claims regarding defendant 
Simpson's alleged generosity and benevolence, whether argued or 
introduced directly or in cross examination, fail every one of 
the determinative criteria regarding admissibility. 
 
The allegation that defendant Simpson was generous has nothing 
to do with the substantive issues of this lawsuit. In addition, 
introduction of this issue may have a prejudicial impact on the 
jury. 
 
Accordingly, the court should also exclude all reference to the 
Nicole Brown Simpson Charitable Foundation on the grounds that 
activities pertaining to the foundation are irrelevant and 
collateral to the issues presented in this litigation. 
 
This alleged evidence is entirely irrelevant to the assessment 
of issues in this case. No members of the Brown family are 
individual plaintiffs in this litigation. The action has been 
brought by the Estate of Nicole Brown Simpson and the only 
beneficiaries of that estate are Nicole Brown Simpson's children, 
Sydney and Justin Simpson. 
 
The introduction of this collateral material would lead the 
jury's attention away from the real facts at issue in this case 
rather than assist them in the search for the truth. At no time 
during this trial should the jury be called to pass judgment on 
the family of the slain plaintiff. The jury must not be led 
astray from the inquiry into whether the defendant Simpson is 
liable for the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald 
Goldman. 
 
Finally, this trial will produce a tremendous amount of 
evidence for the jury to digest. For the defense to contribute 
additional argument or evidence that has no bearing on the facts 
at issue would be unduly time consuming and wasteful of the 
court's limited time. As such, not only must the evidence be 
excluded on relevance grounds, but also on the grounds that it 
would unnecessarily prolong the trial.

MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES 
 
I. 
 
PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 
 
In the aftermath of the brutal slaying of Nicole Brown Simpson, 
the Nicole Brown Simpson Charitable Foundation was formed 
to assist battered women throughout the United States. Certain 
members of the Brown family, including Louis Brown, Juditha 
Brown, Denise Brown, and Dominique Brown serve as officers of 
this charitable foundation. 
 
During depositions and discovery proceedings in this case counsel 
to defendant Simpson have repeatedly directed questions and 
inquiries to members of the Brown family regarding this charitable 
foundation. These repeated attempts to obtain information 
regarding the Foundation suggests that defendant Simpson intends 
to improperly interject issues concerning the foundation into the 
trial of this matter. 
 
The charitable foundation exists solely for the purpose of 
assisting battered women throughout the United States. No funds 
from the foundation have been used in connection with this 
lawsuit. As such, discussion of the foundation is irrelevant to 
the proceedings at bar. Issues pertaining to the foundation are 
entirely collateral. Should defendant raise such issues, plaintiff 
Estate of Nicole Brown Simpson would be compelled to offer 
evidence in rebuttal creating a "trial within a trial." This would 
unnecessarily prolong the trial of this case and distract the jury 
from the true issue at hand: the responsibility of defendant 
Simpson for the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald 
Goldman. The court should therefore prohibit all reference by 
the defense to the Nicole Brown Simpson Charitable Foundation. 
 
II. 
 
STATEMENT OF LAW 
 
It is completely within the court's discretion to prevent 
the defense from introducing evidence regarding the alleged the 
Nicole Brown Simpson Charitable Foundation and to prevent 
defense counsel from inquiring into matters pertaining to the 
Foundation on cross-examination. Cal. Code of Evidence Sec. 352; 
Kessler v. Gray, 77 Cal.App.3d 284; People v. Hess, 104 
Cal.App.2d 642, People v. Rodrigues, 36 Cal.Rptr.2d 235. In 
using its discretion, the trial court must balance the 
probative value of the evidence against the prejudicial effect 
of introducing that evidence. The court must also consider 
whether the evidence will confuse the issue or mislead the 
jury. Cal. Code of Evidence Sec. 352. 
 
Accordingly, the court should exclude all reference to the 
Nicole Brown Simpson Charitable Foundation on the grounds that 
activities pertaining to the foundation are irrelevant and 
collateral to the issues presented in this litigation.

PLAINTIFF (GOLDMAN, JOINED BY PLAINTIFF THE ESTATE 
OF NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON, JOINED BY NON-PARTIES) 
MOTION TO MODIFY GAG ORDER OF 8/13/96 
 
Matter is called for hearing on non-parties' (Agence France Presse,

media coverage. Court indicates it has read and considered all papers 
filed on the issue and hears argument. 
 
Plaintiffs (Goldman, joined by the Estate of Nicole Brown Simpson, 
joined by non-parties Fox-TV, the American Civil Liberties Union, 
Cable News Network, Inc., CBS, Inc., ABC News, National 
Broadcasting Company, Inc., KCAL-TV, the Santa Monica Outlook) 
motion to modify the Court's gag order of 8/13/96 is called for hearing. 
Counsel argue and matter is submitted. 
 
Non-parties (Cable News Network, Inc. CBS, Inc. ABC News, 
National Broadcasting Company, Inc., KCAL-TV, the Santa Monica 
Outlook) oral motion to allow the court reporter to transcribe informal 
chambers conference held 8/13/96 is denied. 
 
Court takes the matters under submission. 
 
Later the Court issues the following rules: The Court having read and 
considered the briefs, memoranda and supporting papers of the non-
party movants, and of the parties, and having conducted a hearing upon 
request of the electronic (television and radio), photographic, reporter 
live-feed to Internet, and courtroom artist coverage under California 
Rules of Court Rule 980, now renders the following ruling: 
 
The Court has concluded from the experience of the criminal trial of 
this defendant concerning the same essential factual circumstances, that 
electronic coverage of the trial significantly diverted and distracted the 
participants therein, it appearing that the conduct of witnesses and 
counsel were unduly influenced by the presence of the electronic 
media. This conduct was manifested in various ways such as playing to 
the camera, gestures, outbursts by counsel and witnesses, in the 
courtroom and thereafter outside of the courthouse, presenting a circus 
atmosphere to the trial. This detracted from the integrity of the trial 
process and the dignity of the courtroom. The trial process requires that 
the evidence be presented to the jury undistorted by these extraneous 
influences. The intensity of media activity in this civil trial thus far 
strongly supports this Court's belief that history will repeat itself unless 
the Court acts to prevent it. It has been the experience of this Court that 
presence of a photographer pointing a camera and taking photographs 
was very distracting and an intrusion to the trial process, affecting 
witnesses, jurors, and everyone else in the courtroom. The 
intrusiveness and distraction likewise will occur when a courtroom 
artist, with drawing pad and other instruments, draws witnesses and 
others in the courtroom, evoking a consciousness and concern of how 
one is being characterized by the artist, instead of focusing on the 
function of being a witness or juror in the trial. The Court concludes 
that the presence of electronic media, as well as photographic cameras 
and courtroom artist will significantly divert and distract the 
participants in the trial, as well as detract from the dignity and decorum 
of the trial and Court. 
 
The experience of the criminal trial demonstrated the overwhelming 
pervasiveness of the electronic coverage's dissemination of selected 
portions out of context of the trial and commentary thereon in every 
format imaginable, particularly newscasts at all hours.  The probability, 
therefore, is extremely high that the jury will be exposed to information 
out of context and outside of the trial process.  The Court is required by 
law to ensure that the jury decide this case only upon its consideration 
of evidence received in the trial and in the context of the trial process. 
It is unreasonable to sequester the jury in a prolonged civil trial. 
 
Based upon the foregoing considerations, in order to protect the rights 
of the parties, the dignity and decorum of the courtroom, the integrity 
of the evidentiary process, and the orderly conduct of the proceedings, 
the Court denies the requests for electronic, photographic and 
courtroom artists coverage of this trial. 
 
With respect to the request for live-feed of court reporter notes to 
Internet, this motion is denied on the ground that live-feed of court 
reporter notes pertain to rough, unedited or uncorrected notes of the 
reporter, which may be incomprehensible and misleading, or otherwise 
incomplete.  To the extent the reporter has transcribed the testimony in 
certified form, the court has no objection to any arrangement that the 
court reporter makes with respect to the dissemination of the 
transcribed trial proceedings, with the exception of any portions 
ordered temporarily sealed. 
 
It is the intention of the Court to enter an order at the time of trial that 
bench conferences out of the hearing on the jury and other proceedings 
out of the presence or hearing of the jury be temporarily sealed until 
the conclusion of the trial. Because the jury is not sequestered, there is 
a high risk of exposing the jury to inadmissible evidence or information 
discussed at such proceedings out of the presence of the jury if such 
information is disseminated publicly by the media, subjecting the trial 
to the possibility of mistrial. 
 
On August 13, 1996, this court issued an order precluding attorneys, 
parties, and witnesses under control of counsel from discussing extra-
judicially any matter connected with this trial. 
 
At the request of non-party media organizations and Plaintiff Frederic 
Goldman, this Court considered their motion for an order vacating this 
order. The Court read and considered the moving papers and heard 
argument from counsel. 
 
The Court has considered the rights of freedom of speech of the 
persons encompassed by this order and the rights of the public and the 
press, and weighed these considerations against the duty of this Court 
to conduct the trial in a neutral and detached environment necessary to 
insulate rational argument and dispassionate decision-making from the 
passions that will inevitably arise from extra-judicial commentary on 
the part of those who are hereby constrained.  The Court has a further 
duty to ensure that the jury receive and consider admissible evidence in 
rendering its verdict, which can only be accomplished through the trial 
process. It is anticipated that the jury will not be sequestered. The 
experience in the criminal trial clearly demonstrated pervasive 
dissemination by all of the media of the comments and opinions of 
counsel therein regarding the trial proceedings, evidence received as 
well as not received or nonexistent, the merits of the case, the jury and 
the judge.  This experience compels the conclusion that the probability 
is extremely high that the jury will be exposed to such extra-judicial 
commentary regarding this trial, inadmissible evidence, misinformation 
and opinions, outside of the trial process, despite judicial admonitions 
and the best efforts of the jurors to avoid such exposure. 
 
There are no reasonable or workable alternatives to an order restraining 
comments by persons to be covered by the Court's order. Sequestration 
of the jury in a prolonged civil trial is not a reasonable alternative to 
restriction of comment by counsel, parties and witnesses under their 
control, until the trial is completed. The criminal trial was so widely 
and extensively covered by the media that relocation of the trial is not a 
reasonable alternative. Admonitions to the jury to disregard media 
dissemination of extra-judicial comments concerned in the order is 
inadequate in face of the massive media coverage anticipated, and from 
the experience in the criminal trial. 
 
Plaintiff Frederic Goldman seeks a modification of this order to permit 
him to speak of victim's rights and reform of the criminal justice 
system. The risk of Plaintiff Goldman's extra-judicial statements in 
these areas that pertain to the very subject matter of the civil trial, to 
wit his opinions and views of the criminal case, the underlying factual 
circumstances of the homicides, evidence, witnesses, or parties in this 
case, reaching the jurors outside of the courtroom is extremely high, 
and it would be unduly prejudicial to allow these views and opinions to 
get before the jury outside of the trial. Mr. Goldman has elected to seek 
redress against the Defendant in this civil trial where in he may 
personally present his opinions and views to the jury within the 
parameters of the rules of evidence. Having thus submitted to the 
jurisdiction of the Court he must abide by the law and rules governing 
this trial. 
 
Based upon these considerations, the Court, has determined the 
interests of justice will be served by the issuance of the above order, as 
modified: 
 
No counsel, party or witnesses under the control of counsel may 
discuss or state any opinions concerning evaluation of evidence, 
including any witness whether called to testify or not, whether offered, 
received,, excluded, purported to exist but not tendered or not 
available, the jury or any juror, the Court, including the trial 
proceedings, or whether the defendant did or did not commit the 
homicides, outside of the trial proceedings with the media or in public 
places within hearing of the general public. This order extends to 
employees and agents or representatives, whether paid or unpaid, of the 
attorneys. This order does not apply to private discussions by and 
among the attorneys in preparation of their cases, with their clients, 
,staff, investigators and witnesses. This order will remain in effect until 
the trial of this case is concluded.

CASE NO. SC036340 
 
COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES FOR WRONGFUL 
DEATH 
 
(JURY TRIAL DEMANDED) 
 
Plaintiffs, FREDRIC GOLDMAN and KIMBERLY ERIN 
GOLDMAN, allege: 
 
1. Plaintiffs, together with Sharon Rufo and DOES 1 
through 50, inclusive, are the sole surviving heirs at law of 
Ronald Goldman, deceased (hereinafter referred to as 
"decedent"). There relationship to decedent are: 
 
NAME                      RELATIONSHIP TO DECEDENT 
Fredric Goldman                 Father 
Kimberly Erin Goldman           Sister 
 
2. Plaintiff Fredric Goldman, as the surviving natural father 
of decedent, would be entitled to succeed to the property of 
decedent under the laws of intestate succession pursuant to 
the provisions of California Probate Code: Sections 6400, et 
seq. 
 
3. Plaintiff Kimberly Erin Goldman, as the sole surviving 
sister of decedent , is entitled to bring this action pursuant to 
California Code of Civil Procedure, Section 377.60. 
 
4. Decedent has no surviving spouse, children, or issue of 
deceased children. 
 
5. Sharon Rufo (herein "Rufo") is the surviving natural 
mother of decedent and a person entitled to bring an action 
to California Code of Civil Procedure Section 377.60. 
However, Rufo filed a separate action in this Court on July 
20, 1994, said action being Case No. SC031947. For the 
reasons hereinafter alleged, plaintiffs believe any damages 
awarded as a result of the wrongful death of decedent should 
be apportioned by the Court with the entirety thereof, or a

at best, a nominal amount to Rufo. Plaintiffs will at the 
appropriate time move the Court to consolidate the action 
heretofore filed by Rufo with the instant action.

entitled to bring this action pursuant to California Code of 
Civil Procedure Section 377.60 and said fictitious parties are 
named herein pursuant to and as required by California Code 
of Civil Procedure Section 382 and plaintiffs will seek leave 
of the Court and amend this complaint to show the true 
names and relationships of said individuals to the decedent 
once the SUM has been ascertained. 
 
7. Plaintiffs are residents of the County of Los Angeles, 
State of California. 
 
8. Plaintiffs are informed and believe and based thereon 
allege that defendant Orenthal James Simpson (hereinafter 
referred to as "defendant Simpson") brutally murdered the 
decedent on June 12, 1994 at a location known as 875 South 
Bundy Drive, in an area of the City of Los Angeles known 
as "Brentwood", which area is located in the  West District 
of this Court and, in doing so, was guilty of a felony as 
defined in California Penal Code Section 187. At all times 
herein mentioned, defendant Simpson was a resident of the 
City of Los Angeles, County of Los Angeles, State of 
California, residing at 375 North Rockingham Avenue, 
which address is also located in the area of the City of Los 
Angeles known as "Brentwood" and located within the West 
District of this Court. 
 
9. The true names, identities and capacities for the 
individuals associates, corporate, co-conspirators or 
otherwise of defendant DOES 1 through 10, inclusive, are 
presently unknown to plaintiffs herein who therefore, sue 
said defendants by such fictitious names Plaintiffs will seek 
leave of the Court to amend this complaint to show the true 
names and capacities of said defendants when the same has 
been ascertained.  Plaintiffs are informed and believe and 
based thereon allege that each of said fictitiously named 
defendants is a person, firm or corporation in some way 
legally responsible for the wrongful death of decedent as 
well as the damages alleged herein. 
 
10. At all times herein mentioned, defendant Simpson and 
DOES 1 through 10, were the agents, servants, employees, 
representatives, and/or co-conspirators of one another and, at 
all times pertinent hereto, were acting within the course and 
scope of their respective services, employment, agency, 
conspiracy, and/or representation. 
 
11. Plaintiff Fredric Goldman and Rufo were married in 
Chicago, Illinois on or about January 8, 1967 (hereinafter 
referred to as the "marriage"). The marriage was dissolved in 
or about 1974. Decedent was born on July 2, 1968. Plaintiff 
Fredric Goldman was awarded custody of decedent and 
plaintiff Kimberly Erin Goldman in or about 1976. Rufo 
remarried and moved from Chicago, Illinois to St. Louis, 
Missouri and ceased having any contact or relationship 
whatsoever with decedent. In fact, Rufo had neither seen 
decedent for approximately 14 years prior to decedent's 
death nor had she attempted to contact him during said 
period of time. As a result, Rufo has not enjoyed and/or 
relied upon the company, presence, companionship, society, 
comfort, education, services, guidance and/or support of 
decedent for more than the past __ years. 
 
12. Plaintiffs are informed and believe and based thereon 
allege that on June 12, 1994, defendant Simpson and Does 1 
through 10, inclusive, and each of them, negligently, 
carelessly unlawfully, willfully, wantonly and maliciously 
threatened to kill decedent. Immediately thereafter on the 
same date defendant Simpson and Does 1 through 10, 
inclusive, and each of them, negligently, unlawfully, 
willfully, wantonly, and maliciously killed decedent. 
 
13. Plaintiffs are informed and believe and based thereon 
allege that by reason of the conduct of defendant Simpson 
and Does 1 through 10, inclusive, as hereinabove alleged, 
and the acts and commission of acts of omission of these 
defendants, as alleged aforesaid, and as a direct and legal 
result thereof, decedent died on or about June 12, 1994. 
 
14. By reason of the death of decedent, which plaintiffs are 
informed and believe and based thereon allege was legally 
and proximately caused by the conduct of defendant 
Simpson and Does 1 through 10, inclusive, as herein 
alleged, plaintiff Fredric Goldman has sustained pecuniary 
loss resulting from the losses of the company, presence, 
companionship, society, comfort, attention, services, 
guidance and support of decedent. 
 
15. By reason of the death of decedent, which plaintiffs are 
informed and believe and based thereon allege was legally 
and proximately caused by the conduct of the defendant 
Simpson and Does 1 through 10, inclusive, as herein 
alleged, plaintiff Kimberly Erin Goldman has sustained 
pecuniary loss resulting from the loss of the company, 
presence, companionship, society, comfort, attention, 
services, guidance and support of decedent. 
 
16. By reason of the death of decedent, which plaintiffs are 
informed and believe and based thereon allege was legally 
and proximately caused by the conduct of defendant 
Simpson and Does 1 through 10, inclusive, as herein 
alleged, plaintiff Fredric Goldman has suffered economic 
compensatory damages in the amount to be proven at trial. 
 
17. By reason of the death of decedent, which plaintiffs are 
informed and believe and based thereon allege was legally 
and proximately caused by the conduct of defendant 
Simpson and Does 1 through 10, inclusive, as herein 
alleged, plaintiff Kimberly Erin Goldman has suffered 
economic and compensatory damages in an amount to be 
proven at trial. 
 
18. By reason of the allegations contained in this complaint, 
including the allegations as to which plaintiffs are informed 
and believe and based thereon allege that the death of 
decedent was legally and proximately caused by defendant 
Simpson and Does 1 through 10, inclusive, plaintiffs, and 
each of them, have been damaged in an amount in excess of 
the minimum jurisdictional amount required by this Court. 
Plaintiffs will seek leave of Court to amend this complaint at 
the time of trial to insert the exact amount of such losses, 
according to proof at the time of trial. 
 
19. The conduct of defendant Simpson Does 1 through 10, 
inclusive,  as hereinabove alleged was willful, wanton and 
outrageous beyond the ability of ordinary human beings to 
comprehend and such conduct was intended by said 
defendants to and did actually cause the death of decedent 
such that the conduct of defendant Simpson and Does 1 
through 10, inclusive, was oppressive and malicious as those 
terms are defined in California Civil Code Section 3294(d). 
The imposition of substantial punitive and exemplary 
damages will in this case be both justified and necessary in 
order to send out a message from this Court to all persons in 
the United States and throughout the world that such vicious 
and outrageous savagery inflicted by one human being upon 
another shall be met with the severest of civil penalties. 
 
WHEREFORE, plaintiffs pray for judgment against 
defendants, and each of them, as follows: 
 
1. For general damages according to proof; 
2. For special damages, according to proof; 
3. For reimbursement of funeral expenses and costs of 
burial; 
4. For interest on all sums awarded, according to proof; 
5. For punitive and exemplary damages, according to proof; 
6. For costs of suit incurred herein; 
7. For such other and further relief as to the Court may be 
just and proper.

representative of the Estate of NICOLE   
BROWN SIMPSON, deceased,  
  
Plaintiff,  
  
vs.  
  
ORENTHAL JAMES SIMPSON,  
  
Defendant  
  
CASE NO: SC036876  
  
COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES-  
SURVIVAL ACTION  
(C.C.P. Section 377.30)  
  
Plaintiff alleges:  
  
FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION  
  
1) On or about November 7, 1994, Louis H. Brown was  
appointed executor of the Estate of Nicole Brown Simpson,  
deceased, by the Superior Court of California County in 
Los Angeles, in Case No. SP002190. Testamentary letters are  
attached hereto, marked Exhibit A and incorporated herein 
by this reference.  
  
2) Plaintiff is the Executor and personal representative of 
the Estate of Nicole Brown Simpson.  
  
3) That at all times herein mentioned, all acts occurred in 
the community of Brentwood, County of Los Angeles, State of  
California.  
  
4) Orenthal James Simpson is and was a resident of the  
County of Los Angeles.  
  
5) At all times herein mentioned, decedent Nicole Brown  
Simpson was a resident of the County of Los Angeles.  
  
6) The true names or capacities, whether individual,  
corporate, associate or otherwise of the defendants designated
herein as Does 1 through 10, inclusive, and each of them, 
are unknown to plaintiff, who therefor sues said defendants by  
such fictitious names, and plaintiff will ask leave to amend  
this complaint at such time as the true names and/or  
capacities are ascertained. Plaintiff is informed and believes,
and thereon alleges, that each defendant designated herein 
as DOE is responsible in some manner for the events and  
happenings herein referred to, and caused or contributed to  
the injuries and damages to plaintiff as herein alleged.  
  
7) On or about June 12, 1994, after the foregoing cause of  
action arose in her favor, Nicole Brown Simpson, who would
have been the plaintiff in this action if she had lived, died 
as the legal result of the wrongful acts of Orenthal James  
Simpson and Does 1 though 10.  
  
8) On or about June 12, 1994, Orenthal James Simpson and  
Does 1 through 10, planned and prepared to assault, batter  
and murder Nicole Brown Simpson and did thereafter  
brutally, and with malice aforethought, stalk, attack and  
repeatedly stab and beat decedent, Nicole Brown Simpson.  
Defendants, and each of them, left her on the walkway in  
front of her residence to die. Nicole Brown Simpson 
survived the brutal attack for some unknown period of time and  
thereafter bled to death as a direct legal result of the 
wrongful and homicidal acts of Orenthal James Simpson and Does 1  
through 10.  
  
9) The attack was perpetrated by defendant Orenthal James  
Simpson and Does 1 through 10 with the full knowledge 
that the assault and battery upon decedent's body would lead to  
her death. Each of the acts alleged herein were done with a  
wanton, reckless disregard for the rights of the decedent 
and with the full knowledge that she would die as a result of 
said acts.  
  
10) As a proximate result of the assault, battery and murder  
of Nicole Brown Simpson by defendants, and each of them  
decedent was required to and did employ physicians and  
surgeons to examine, treat and care for her and did incur  
medical and incidental expenses in an amount unknown at  
this time. The complaint will be amended according to 
proof when the amount becomes known.  
  
11) On or about June 12, 1994, and immediately prior to  
decedent's death, personal property of decedent was  
destroyed as a legal result of defendants' wrongful acts. The  
amount of said property is unknown at present. Plaintiff 
will amend this complaint according to proof when said amount  
becomes known.  
  
12) In doing the acts herein alleged, defendant, and each of  
them, acted with oppression, fraud and malice, and plaintiff 
is entitled to punitive and exemplary damages in an amount to  
be proven at the time of trial.  
  
WHEREFORE, plaintiff prays judgment as follows:  
1) For medical and related expenses according to proof.  
2) For personal property according to proof.  
3) For punitive and exemplary damages according to proof.  
4) For costs of suit herein incurred.  
5) For such other and further relief as the court
   may deem proper.

<P><B>Opening Statements Set To Begin</B><BR>
<IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/casefiles/simpson.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=0 BORDER=0>SANTA MONICA, Oct. 22 (Evening) --  Opening statements will begin Wednesday after Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki rules on several pending motions.</P>

<P>Fredric Goldman asked the judge to bar defense lawyers from referring in their opening statements to Detective Mark Fuhrman's recent no contest plea to perjury charges, his testimony in the criminal trial, and the fact that he may testify in the civil trial. Many of the jurors are already aware of Fuhrman's plea, having been asked for their feelings about it in jury selection.</P>

<P>O.J. Simpson's  lawyers, who won a key ruling last week allowing them to claim the Los Angeles Police Department may have planted some blood evidence and the bloody glove, say Fuhrman is too important not to mention.</P>

<P>The plaintiffs also asked Judge Fujisaki to explain the difference between criminal and civil trials to the jury in order to prevent confusion. Simpson was acquitted in October 1995 of murder charges. </P>

<P>After the motions are decided, the victims' families will make their opening statements beginning at 9:00 a.m. followed by the defense.</P>

<H2>The Families v. O.J. Simpson</H2>

<P><B>Plaintiffs Promise New Evidence</B><BR>
<IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/casefiles/simpson.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=0 BORDER=0>SANTA MONICA, Oct. 23 (Noon) -- As opening statements began today in the O.J. Simpson Civil trial, lead plaintiffs' attorney Daniel Petrocelli gave notice that he will present a case that is quite different than Simpson's criminal prosecution. </P>

<P>Now at the noon lunch break at the Santa Monica Courthouse, Petrocelli has spoken for about two hours; he will likely continue for another two. Petrocelli will be followed by Michael Brewer, who represents Sharon Rufo. His statement is expected to take up the remainder of the day. </P>

<P>Earlier in the day,  Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki ruled that the defense could not -- for the moment -- mention that Detective Mark Fuhrman could be a witness in the trial. The judge reserved ruling on the Fuhrman testimony until it has been further briefed by the attorneys. Briefs are due Nov. 1.</P>

<P>Already, the plaintiffs have begun to deviate from the case presented by prosecutors in Simpson's criminal trial. Perhaps the most significant difference is that they have scrapped the timeline used by the criminal prosecutors. Instead of claiming Simpson killed Nicole and Ron around 10:15 p.m. on June 12, 1994, the plaintiffs have adopted a later time sequence that puts the killings around 10:35 p.m. Petrocelli told the jury he will present Robert Heidstra, a defense witness in the criminal trial, who will testify to hearing a young male voice say  "hey, hey, hey," and several minutes later saw a white Jeep-like vehicle speeding away. </P>

<P>The plaintiffs also will not rely on coroner Lakshmanan Sathyavagiswaran to tell the story of the deaths. Instead they will use Dr. Werner Spitz, a well regarded expert witness.</P>

<P>New evidence will also play a large role in the civil trial. Petrocelli told jurors he will introduce evidence about Simpson's flight from the police, his apparent suicide attempt, and fiber evidence from Simpson's Bronco -- all of which was not used in the criminal case.  The plaintiffs will also introduce a recently discovered photograph of Simpson wearing Bruno Magli shoes -- the same shoes experts say left bloody footprints at the crime scene. In his sworn deposition earlier this year, Simpson said he would never own such a pair of "ugly-ass shoes."</P>

<P>The scene outside the courthouse has been relatively tame. Perhaps a dozen protesters carried signs, slightly more than half in support of Simpson. Some of the protests have a Halloween flavor. Six grave stones are lined up on the lawn, complaining mainly of judicial corruption. One of the grave markers reads: O.J. Simpson, strangled by aliens. Court TV reporter Dan Abrams heard Simpson in the hallway whistling, "If I Only Had A Brain," the song sung by the Scarecrow in the Wizard of Oz. Family members in the courtroom include both of Nicole's parents, Denise Brown, Fred Goldman, and Sharon Rufo. O.J.'s mother, who is celebrating her 75th birthday today, is also in court. Surprisingly there are several empty seats in the courtroom.</P>

<H2>The Families v. O.J. Simpson</H2>

<P><B>Brewer Focuses On Keys</B><BR>
<IMG SRC="/graphics/ctv/casefiles/simpson.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=0 BORDER=0>SANTA MONICA, Oct. 23 (Evening) -- In the afternoon session of O.J. Simpson's civil trial here, plaintiffs'  attorney Michael Brewer told the jury that Simpson's Bronco chase and purported suicide note showed evidence of his guilt. Brewer also revealed that police confiscated from Simpson keys to Nicole's property on Bundy.</P>

<P>These keys, the plaintiffs claim, were the only way to get in and out of the back gate -- where the killer likely entered and left the property. Furthermore, Brewer said, Simpson testified in his deposition for this trial that he didn't have any keys to his ex-wife's property at the time of the murder.</P>

<P>Brewer, who represents Ron Goldman's mother Sharon Rufo, also spoke briefly about his client's relationship with her son. While it has been widely reported that the two were estranged, Brewer told the jury that they did keep in touch. Ron called his mother to tell her he would be on an episode of Studs, Brewer said. </P>

<P>Plaintiffs' attorney John Kelly, who represents Nicole Brown Simpson's estate, began his opening statement, which is focusing on O.J. and Nicole's relationship and domestic violence evidence. Kelly will continue when court convenes tomorrow morning.</P>

<P>Kelly also told the jury to keep in mind "the simplest and clearest" of the evidence: the rare extra-large gloves found at the scene, the bloody impressions from the size 12 Bruno Magli shoes, the drops of blood leaving the crime scene that show a DNA match to Simpson, and the cuts on Simpson's hand when he returned from Chicago. The plaintiffs, Brewer said, will introduce pictures of Simpson wearing the gloves and the shoes.</P>

<P>"You will see the gloves on Mr. Simpson's hands and the shoes on his feet before the murders occurred," Brewer said.</P>
