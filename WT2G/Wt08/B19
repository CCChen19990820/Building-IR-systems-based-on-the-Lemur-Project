<H2>Credit Cards</H2>

<H3><A NAME="c1">1. What are the advantages of having a credit card, and how do I get
one?</A></H3>

<P>Credit cards are a very convenient and secure way of paying for goods and
services without the need to carry large amounts of cash. And, of course, you
don't have to repay the cost of your purchases right away. Bank credit cards
are accepted at most retail outlets, restaurants, and gas stations. They
can also be used to obtain cash advances, access a variety of personal accounts through ABMs, or to
perform other banking tasks.

<P>To apply for a bank credit card, just drop into any branch of a bank that's
associated with the card you want and ask for an
application. Simply fill it out and return it to the branch and, if you qualify,
you'll receive your card in the mail. Applications for gasoline and
department store cards are available at the point of purchase.

<H3><A NAME="c2">2. I've just started working and I don't have a credit history; can I still
qualify for a credit card?</A></H3>

<P>Yes. Many banks and other issuers of credit cards are willing to provide young
people, including students, with a basic credit card set to a low limit such as
$500. Check with your local bank branch.

<P>Incidentally, responsible use of your first credit card can be a good way to
start building a positive credit record.

<H3><A NAME="c3">3. How secure are credit cards?</A></H3>

<P>Credit cards are a very secure way of purchasing goods and services. With the use of holograms and other technical devices, forgery is
becoming increasingly difficult. And if your card is lost or stolen, a phone call
is all it takes to stop unauthorized use of your card and to get it replaced.

<H3><A NAME="c4">4. Is there an advantage to a bank card versus a department store card or a
gasoline card?</A></H3>

<P>Definitely. Most bank credit cards charge a lower interest rate on outstanding balances than gasoline
companies or retailers. Just as important, bank credit cards are accepted all over the world and can also be used for everyday
banking through an ABM.

<H3><A NAME="c5">5. Do all bank credit cards offer the same features and benefits?</A></H3>

<P>No. Banks compete for your business, and some of the ways they do that is by charging different fees and offering different features and benefits with their credit cards. Some have lower interest
rates than while others have a wider range of features.

<H3><A NAME="c6">6. What are the benefits of having a gold card?</A></H3>

<P>Gold cards offer you more features than regular bank cards.  The
features offered on any individual gold card will vary in accordance with
the bank who offers it.    Gold Visa cards have a minimum $5,000 credit
limit.  They also include various standard features, such as car rental
collision insurance, travel accident insurance protection, purchase
security and extended warranty insurance.


<H3><A NAME="c7">7. How do the bank cards that are associated with sponsoring organizations work?</A></H3>

<P>A bank card that is associated with a sponsoring organization, such as a
professional association, a club, or an alumni association, is usually
referred to as an "Affinity Card".  When you use an affinity card, a part
of the merchant fee goes toward the support of the organization.  With most
affinity cards, you pay the same fees and charges as you would normally pay
with a regular bank card.  Some affinity cards have other benefits, such as
a points scheme for purchasing goods or services related to the sponsoring
organization.

<H3><A NAME="c8">8. What are the benefits of a credit card that's tied in with an automobile
manufacturer or other types of co-branded cards?</A></H3>

<P>Co-branded cards let you accumulate earnings to a specified limit based on the amount of money
you spend using your credit card and then apply those earnings towards the
purchase of items offered by an affiliated company.  For instance, a tie-in between a credit
card and automobile manufacturer would provide you with a
way to translate the value of the purchases made with your card into
earnings that could be put toward the purchase price or lease downpayment of a new automobile
offered by the affiliated automobile company.

<H3><A NAME="c9">9. What is a shopping club?</A></H3>

<P>A number of credit cards offer at-home shopping benefits. From time to time
you may receive inserts or a catalogue of products, or a promotion for an individual product,
which you can purchase using your credit card. The product is usually sent to you
via mail or by a parcel delivery service. Some of the products available are
exclusive to the credit card provider and cannot be purchased at a retail outlet.

<H3><A NAME="c10">10. What are cheque cashing privileges?  What are special cheques?</A></H3>

<P>Certain credit cards allow you to cash personal cheques, or cheques made
out to you, at any branch of the bank that issued the card.  In addition,
some bank cards issue special cheques that enable you to make purchases
from a merchant who doesn't accept credit cards.  These cheques are treated
as cash advances.  As an extra feature, special cheques are also offered by
some banks as a way for you to consolidate your outstanding balances if you
have more than one credit card.


<H3><A NAME="c11">11. Do all cards offer travel rewards?</A></H3>

<P>No, certain cards are affiliated with travel agency or airline frequent flyer programs through which you can
accumulate points based on the value of the purchases you make with your card. If
you want to take advantage of this feature, make sure you have a card that is
associated with the airline or program you're interested in.

<H3><A NAME="c12">12. Do all cards charge an annual fee?</A></H3>

<P>Not all credit cards charge an annual fee. Some basic bank cards charge no annual fee.

<P>Gold cards have higher annual fees with benefits which can add up to substantial savings and, in some cases, can more than
offset the annual fee.

<H3><A NAME="c13">13. What happens if I try to make a purchase with my credit card and I exceed
my limit?</A></H3>

<P>When the sales clerk runs your credit card through the point-of-sale terminal or requests authorization, an
electronic link is made with your credit card account to gain authorization for
the purchase. If the amount of your intended purchase exceeds your available credit, the digital display on the
terminal will read "authorization declined."

<H3><A NAME="c14">14. How is my credit limit determined, and how can I increase my limit?</A></H3>

<P>Your credit limit is partly a function of the type of card you have.  For
example,  some basic credit cards have a standard credit limit of $2,000,
but gold cards can extend your credit limit to more than $5,000. 
The determination of your credit limit can also be a function of your
financial history and asset record.

<H3><A NAME="c15">15. What should I do if my credit card is lost or stolen?</A></H3>

<P>Bank cards, such as Visa, have an international network for handling these
situations.  As soon as you discover that your card is missing, call the
customer service number provided with your card.  Your card will
immediately be cancelled to prevent its fraudulent use. Some cards also offer a card registry service to
assist you in the event that your cards are lost or stolen.

<H3><A NAME="c16">16. What is my liability if my credit card is stolen?</A></H3>

<P>With most cards, if a fraudulent purchase is made after you have reported
the card stolen, you will not be held liable for any of the costs.

<H3><A NAME="c17">17. Do all credit cards offer emergency card replacement?</A></H3>

<P>In most cases, you can get your card replaced in an emergency, usually within a
couple of days. If this feature is important to you, make sure your card has it;
if not, apply for one that does.

<H3><A NAME="c18">18. Can I use my credit card at an ABM to get cash or access my bank
accounts?</A></H3>

<P>Most bank credit cards can be coded for use at bank machines. You can arrange this through the card issuer. You simply insert
the card so the machine can read the magnetic strip, then key in your personal
identification number (PIN). 

<H3><A NAME="c19">19. Can I get travel insurance and purchase security and extended warranty insurance on my credit card?</A></H3>

<P>More and more credit cards are offering various insurance features. These might
include several forms of travel-related insurance, such as accident and health
coverage while travelling outside Canada, delayed baggage
insurance, and car rental insurance.

<P>Purchase security insurance is a standard Visa gold card feature. It
usually covers theft and damage related to products you purchased using your
credit card, up to a limited period of time.

<H3><A NAME="c20">20. Can I get supplementary cards for members of my family?</A></H3>

<P>Most banks and other credit card providers will give you additional cards on
request. There may be a fee for supplementary cards.

<H3><A NAME="c21">21. How are credit card interest rates determined, and how can I find out the
interest rate currently being charged on a particular card?</A></H3>

<P>The interest rates charged by different credit cards reflect several factors,
including the bank's cost of funds and administrative costs. Changes in
the interest rate charged by the Bank of Canada can affect credit card interest
rates, but not as frequently as these changes affect personal loan rates.

<P>To find out the interest rate currently being charged on your credit card, just
call the customer service
department of the card issuer. Your monthly statement will also
show the applicable interest rate for the billing period.

<H3><A NAME="c22">22. What is a grace period?</A></H3>

<P>Many credit cards give you a grace period, which is the length of time from the date your monthly statement is issued to the date you have to make a payment. 
Interest begins to accrue on your purchases on the payment date. Grace periods can vary
from two weeks to a month.

<P>When you buy goods and services, you will not be charged interest on the purchase
price until the payment date on your next monthly statement. Depending on when you
made the purchase, you may not have to pay for it (or make a partial payment) for
several weeks.


<H3><A NAME="c23">23. Do I pay interest as soon as I make a purchase, or do I get a grace
period?</A></H3>

<P>With most bank credit cards, when you buy goods and services, you will not be charged
interest on the purchase price until the due date or payment date on your next monthly statement. If
your due date is the 15th of the month, for example, and you purchase an item on,
say, the 20th, then you'll have a grace period of about 25 days before interest
is charged. Of course, if you pay in full by the due date, no interest on purchases is charged.

<H3><A NAME="c24">24. Why is interest charged immediately on cash advances but not on
purchases?</A></H3>

<P>Cash advances, unlike purchases, are treated as a loan, and similar to other types of loans,
the interest begins to accrue as soon as the cash is advanced.

<H3><A NAME="c25">25. When I use my credit card in a foreign country, how is the currency exchange rate calculated, and can I use my credit card to get a
cash advance?</A></H3>

<P>Bank credit cards can be used in most countries around the world to purchase
goods and services, just like in Canada. Most bank cards can also be used
to access your accounts through the many thousands of ABMs that display the
Interac and Plus System logos. You can get cash, in local currency, in the
same way that you would in Canada.

<P>The exchange rate of the local currency against the Canadian dollar is calculated
on the date the purchase or cash advance is posted to your account. The rate is calculated on the basis of the spot exchange rate in effect at that
time.

<H3><A NAME="c26">26. Is it safe to give out my credit card number when purchasing goods or
services by phone?</A></H3>

<P>It is best to initiate the phone connection yourself and to be confident that you are dealing with a legitimate
organization. 

<H2>Debit Cards</H2>


<H3><A NAME="d1">1. What is a debit card?</A></H3>

<P>A debit card is your Automated Banking Machine (ABM) card.

<H3><A NAME="d2">2. How is a debit card different from a credit card and how do I use it?</A></H3>

<P>A credit card allows you to purchase goods and services and to pay for them
at a later date; hence credit. And you can have a credit card without necessarily having a
bank account. A debit card, on the other hand, is a means for authorizing an
electronic transfer of funds from your bank account to the account of the
merchant where you are making the purchase. You pay for your purchase
immediately, but you don't need to carry cash with you.

<P>Usually, to use your debit card, simply hand it to the sales clerk who will swipe it
through the electronic reader. The clerk will give you a key pad in which you
enter your personal identification number (PIN). When the transaction is completed
you will be given a paper record, just as you would when you make a purchase with
a credit card.

<P>Making purchases with a debit card is as fast and convenient as using cash and a
lot more secure.

<H3><A NAME="d3">3. How do I apply for a debit card?</A></H3>

<P>Applying for a debit card is as easy as applying for a chequing account. Just complete
an application form - available at any bank branch - and
return it postage paid, or drop it off at your nearest branch. Your PIN number will arrive with the card but you are
free to change it at any bank branch that offers this service.

<H3><A NAME="d4">4. Do all stores accept debit cards?</A></H3>

<P>Many, but not all stores in Canada are now on-line with Interac, the debit card network,
especially grocery stores which traditionally have not accepted credit cards.

<H3><A NAME="d5">5. Do I pay an annual fee to have a debit card, and will I be charged a fee
each time I make a purchase?</A></H3>

<P>With a debit card there is no annual fee to pay, but depending on your bank account, you may be charged a small
service fee every time you make a purchase - similar to the service fee you pay when you make an ABM withdrawal.

<H3><A NAME="d6">6. Can I get a cash advance with a debit card?</A></H3>

<P>No. Only credit cards provide cash advances. However, because your debit card is also your ABM card, you
can use it to withdraw cash from your chequing or savings account. 

<H3><A NAME="d7">7. What happens if I use my debit card and I don't have sufficient funds in my
account to cover the purchase?</A></H3>

<P>When you make a purchase using your debit card, an electronic link is made
with your bank account. If there are funds in your account to cover the
cost of the purchase, the transaction will be authorized. But if the
purchase price is more than the balance in your account, the point-of-sale
terminal will read "authorization declined." If you qualify, some financial institutions
will provide overdraft protection on certain kinds of chequing
accounts, in which case your purchase may be authorized but it will cause
your account to be overdrawn (interest will also be payable).

<H3><A NAME="d8">8. What should I do if my debit card is lost or stolen?</A></H3>

<P>As soon as you discover that your card is missing, call the customer service
number provided to you with your card and arrangements will be made to issue a new one.
Remember, your card is of no use to a thief without your secret PIN
number.

</OL>

<HR>

<P><H3><A NAME="q1">1. Be knowledgeable and always read the fine
print.</A></H3>

<P>The first step to having a healthy credit record is to find out as much as
you can before you borrow money. When you do borrow, find out the conditions of
the loan: Can you prepay your installments? Can you reduce the term of the loan
without penalty? Can you double up your payments? Don't be afraid to shop around
for the best interest rate - or to ask for a better rate. And always read a loan
application thoroughly before you sign; be ready to question anything in it that
you don't understand.

<P><H3><A NAME="q2">2. Calculate how much credit you can afford.</A></H3>

<P>Before you apply for a loan or for a credit card, take a look at your
personal financial situation to make sure you can comfortably repay it.
Make up a personal or family budget that lists your monthly expenses and
compares them with your after-tax income. You can then judge how much you
can afford in monthly payments. If you feel the payments have to be lower
in order to be affordable, you may be able to extend the term of the loan.
This will have the effect of reducing the amount of the monthly payments,
but be aware that the total amount of interest you pay will be higher.

<P><H3><A NAME="q3">3. Stick to your budget, and always borrow within your
means.</A></H3>

<P>It's always a good idea to have a budget - whether you borrow money or not. A
budget helps you keep track of where you're spending money and can help you
save, too. And, of course, a budget will tell you how much you can afford to
borrow, whether it's a term loan, a personal line of credit, or a credit card.
If you feel that the cost of a loan will put too much pressure on your personal
finances, then reduce the amount you need to borrow.

<P><H3><A NAME="q4">4. Avoid impulse buying.</A></H3>

<P>When you have a sudden urge to buy an item and you reach for your credit
card, ask yourself this question:  Would I be willing to make this purchase
if I were paying with cash?  If the answer is no, then be
strong-willed and do not purchase the item. If the answer is
yes, then ask yourself: Can I afford to make the monthly payments?  By
taking a moment to ask these questions you change a potential impulse
purchase into a considered purchase which is a good way to help you stay on
track financially.

<P><H3><A NAME="q5">5. Know how much credit is costing you.</A></H3>

<P>When you apply for a loan or use a credit card, always find out what the
interest rate is and what the total interest cost will be. The longer the
term of your loan, the more interest you'll be paying. With a loan, you may
find it beneficial to shorten the term and increase the monthly payments so
you end up paying less in interest. And some banks will let you make
payments weekly or bi-weekly, which can also help reduce the interest cost. With
a credit card, the longer you extend your credit card payments, the more
interest you'll be paying. Since you can make payments as often as you like
on your credit card, you can definitely reduce the amount of interest you
pay the faster and more often you make payments.

<P><H3><A NAME="q6">6. Match the credit to the purchase.</A></H3>

<P>Different forms of credit are used for different kinds of purchases. Term
loans typically are used to buy "big ticket" items, like a car or a boat or
furniture. Credit cards are a convenient way of paying for everyday purchases
without the need to carry large amounts of cash. A personal line of credit, like
a term loan, can be used for a variety of major purchases, from a vacation to a
home renovation. And a residential mortgage is most often used to finance the
purchase of a home or recreational property. 

<P><H3><A NAME="q7">7. How to consolidate your debts.</A></H3>

<P>Some people have different loans to finance their various purchases: one or
two term loans and, perhaps, several credit card balances. It's often
beneficial, both financially and in terms of record-keeping, to consolidate
these debts. For example, outstanding balances on credit cards can be paid off
with a less costly term loan. And two or three loans can be combined into one,
sometimes at a better interest rate.

<P><H3><A NAME="q8">8. Build a good credit rating by repaying your loans on
time.</A></H3>

<P>Having a good credit rating is valuable, and it's something you'll want to
protect. The easiest way to do that is to make sure you repay your loans and make your minimum credit card payments
promptly. Don't get behind with your payments and try to avoid a situation where
you can't repay your loan. It's also a good idea to keep the number of loans and
credit cards you have to a comfortable minimum. If you find you have more loans
than you'd like, then consider consolidating them into one.

<P><H3><A NAME="q9">9. Different kinds of consumer credit - their pros and cons.</A></H3>

<P>There are essentially four kinds of consumer credit: <A HREF="#c1">personal term loans</A>, <A HREF="#c2">personal
lines of credit</A>, <A HREF="#c3">credit cards</A>, and <A HREF="#c4">residential mortgage loans</A>. 

<UL>
<LI><A NAME="c1">Personal term loans are for a fixed amount of money, called the principal, and are
repaid over a set term. The total cost of the loan is the principal plus the
interest. The amount of the principal and the  interest rate will be affected by
the type of collateral you provide to secure the loan. Different lending
institutions offer different features with their personal loans, including
flexible repayment options and variable interest rates.</A>
<P>
<LI><A NAME="c2">A personal line of credit (LOC) is similar to a business line of credit: you
arrange for an amount of money to be available to you on demand. You "draw down"
on your line of credit by writing a cheque against your LOC account. You are
charged interest only for the amount of money you have drawn down. In many ways
an LOC is like writing yourself a loan whenever you need it. For that reason,
many people find this form of credit very convenient, since they only have to
make one application. Interest rates for personal LOC's are usually tied to the
prime rate and will therefore vary. The interest rate will also be affected by
the quality of security you provide to secure your LOC.</A>
<P>
<LI><A NAME="c3">Credit cards are a form of revolving credit, which means that the amount
of credit varies with your purchases and cash advances, versus the payments you
make to reduce your balance. Credit cards typically have a higher interest
rate compared to other forms of credit, but also offer greater convenience and other features
that in some circumstances tend to offset the higher interest rates charged.</A>
<P>
<LI><A NAME="c4">For most people, residential mortgage loans represent the largest loans they'll
ever receive. That's why mortgages typically are amortized over 15 to 25 years.
There are several types of mortgages available and many of them offer different
repayment and interest options. Interest rates are related to the Bank of Canada
rate, the repayment term, and other features of your mortgage. Because
amortization usually covers many years, the total amount of interest you pay
could be considerable. That's why many mortgage lenders give you the freedom to
pay down a portion of your mortgage with a lump sum on the anniversary date, effectively
shortening the amortization period and the interest cost.</A>
</UL>

<P><H3><A NAME="q10">10. How to reduce your interest costs.</A></H3>

<P>The cost of credit is mostly in the interest you pay to borrow the money.
There are several ways you can keep that cost to a minimum. In the case of a
mortgage or term loan, you can reduce the term, which will increase monthly
payments but reduce the total amount of interest paid. Or you can repay the loan more
frequently, say weekly or bi-weekly. Many financial institutions will let you
make a lump sum payment on the anniversary date, and that, too, will reduce the
amount of interest you pay over the term of the loan. With credit cards, the easiest way to keep your
interest cost down is to pay off the balance on or shortly after the monthly due
date. 

<P><H3><A NAME="q11">11. The role of credit bureaus and how to check your
credit history.</A></H3>

<P>Credit bureaus keep records on the credit history of individuals and
companies. These records are used by lending institutions - banks, trust
companies, credit unions, and so on - to determine your creditworthiness. Along
with other information you supply, your credit record will be used by the lender
in making a decision about your loan and, possibly, the interest rate. Your
credit record cannot be given out to just anyone, but you do have the legal
right to see it and to correct any wrong information. Simply look up the number for
the credit bureau in your local telephone directory.  Your credit bureau
will be able to give you your credit rating, free of charge. You will be asked to provide the following information:  name, address, date of birth, and two major pieces of identification (e.g. social insurance and driver's license).

<P><H3><A NAME="q12">12. Don't be afraid to ask for help.</A></H3>

<P>If you think you might have difficulty repaying a loan - because of illness
or job loss, for example - don't wait until you are forced to miss payments. Go
and talk to the lending officer who authorized the loan and explain your
circumstances. You'll be pleasantly surprised at how sympathetic they'll be and,
more importantly, at their willingness to make adjustments to help you through a
difficult period. If you would like general advice about credit, you may want to
talk to someone at a credit counselling agency. Most of these agencies are government-run
and you can find them in the government section of your phone book.

<P>The new TD GOLD TRAVEL CARD is one of the most innovative and flexible
travel reward cards available in Canada today. Innovative because it offers
what no other credit card travel programme in Canada offers - the ability for
Cardholders to travel <B>when</B> they want, <B>where</B> they want and
<B>how</B> they want.  Add to this the programme's highly flexible system for
accumulating earnings and redeeming TD points, and the TD GOLD TRAVEL CARD
clearly does offer
the kind of travel programme that "goes one better" than anything else on the
market.<BR CLEAR>

charged to the TD EMERALD Visa Card. That means cardholders can get back the entire annual

fee, just by using their card regularly!

<h3>Release Publication<br>Wednesday, January 15, 1997</h3>

<h2>News Release - Communique</h2>

<h3>TD EXECUTIVE SAYS B.C. GROWTH ACCELERATING AS BANKS HELP
CANADIAN BUSINESSES ACCESS GLOBAL MARKETS</h3>

<p><b>Toronto/Vancouver </b> - TD Bank Vice Chairman S.R. (Bud) McMorran says
economic growth is accelerating in British Columbia while long term prospects for large and
small businesses alike are improving due to international opportunities.  

<P>&quot;This year, we expect the pace of growth in B.C. to accelerate.  There should be a
gradual recovery of the forest sector; and we expect the housing market to be very healthy --
fuelled by low interest rates and steady job gains,&quot; McMorran said in a speech to the
Chamber of Commerce in Surrey, B.C. today. &quot;By 1998, we expect B.C.'s economic
expansion will really pick up speed, and surpass the national average.&quot;

<P>According to McMorran, economic expansion in Canada in the nineties has been driven
by the success of Canadian businesses in going global, and Canadian banks have been playing
a vital role in the process.

<P>&quot;Our industry has been at the forefront of globalizing financial markets and
products through electronic commerce -- giving our business customers an edge.&quot;

<P>McMorran noted that the efficiency, electronic capabilities and size of Canada's banks
provide an advantage to large and small businesses pursuing international opportunities.                                     

<P>The banks &quot;are large enough to participate in global markets, to access global
money markets for customers, to provide a full range of foreign exchange services and a full
range of risk management and hedging services that are so essential to successful global
commerce,&quot; McMorran added.

<P>Pointing to TD's Trade Services Office and Treasury Services Office in Vancouver,
cash management specialists in the Lower Mainland, and financing specialists focused on key
provincial industry sectors, McMorran said that TD is well positioned to help B.C. businesses
reach new markets.

<P>&quot;By utilizing our expertise, B.C. businesses can start exploring new horizons right
here.&quot;

<h3>Release Publication<br>Monday, January 6, 1997</h3>

<h2>News Release - Communique</h2>



<h3>TD BANK SETS NEW INDUSTRY STANDARD FOR INVESTMENT ADVICE
NEW FINANCIAL PLANNING TOOLS ACCESSIBLE TO ALL CANADIANS</h3>



<P><b>TORONTO</B> - TD Asset Management Inc. (TDAM) today launched a series of
financial planning tools available to all TD Bank customers in branches across the country
beginning January 6.

<P>&quot;The cornerstone of our success has been superior fund performance, in-depth
education, information and service for our customers,&quot; says Mark Wettlaufer, President of
TD Asset Management Inc. &quot;Now we're going the next step to deliver high calibre
financial planning tools for our staff to present to their customers.&quot;

<P>TD's consolidated financial planning program involves three new comprehensive guides that
can be tailored to the needs of any individual.  TD's <b>Goal Planner</b> determines financial
goals and assesses current situations; the <b>Education Savings Planner</b> establishes the
necessary savings for a child's education; the <b>Retirement Planner</b> outlines an
individual's retirement savings requirements.

<P>Each new tool has been developed to work in concert with a revised version of the highly
successful <b>Wealth Allocation Model (WAM)</b> as well as a monthly supplement
offering updates on fund performance, information and educational opportunities offering
customers a chance to learn more.  The new <b>WAM</b> has been further enhanced to offer:
<P><ul><li>both RRSP and non-RRSP portfolio models
<li>a model for rebalancing portfolios
<li>portfolio returns
<li>fixed income and other mutual fund recommendations
<li>methods on how to maximize income and tax-effective investing</ul>

<P>&quot;Fund performance is important, but our customers demand and deserve a greater
understanding of how investing can work for them in becoming more successful
investors,&quot; says Mr. Wettlaufer. &quot;These new materials are available to all our
customers and provide the unbiased advice and straightforward information they've come to
expect from us.&quot;

<P>These new financial planning tools are in addition to those already developed by TDAM
such as the recently released financial planning book, <b>Women in the Know</b>, published
by Key Porter Books, now entering its second printing.

<P>TD Asset Management Inc. moved from ninth to the fifth largest mutual fund company in
1996 in terms of total assets.  The October launch of two new Green Line funds, The Health
Sciences Fund and the U.S. Blue Chip Equity Fund were enormously successful and swelled
retail assets to more than $10.4 billion as of December 31, 1996.

<P>TD Asset Management Inc. is a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Toronto-Dominion Bank. 
TDAM currently manages $23 billion for mutual funds, pension funds, corporations, institutions,
endowments, foundations and high net worth individuals.

<h3>Release Publication<br>Tuesday, December 10, 1996</h3>
<h2>News Release - Communique</h2>

<h3>Exact - North America's First Electronic Cash Card Launched in Kingston,
Ontario</h3>

<P>The way people can buy things has changed in Kingston, Ontario, with the December
10th, 1996 launch of <b>Exact</b>, North America's first and only publicly available,
reloadable electronic cash card.

<P>The brainchild of three Canadian financial institutions - Bank of Montreal, The Toronto-
Dominion Bank and Canada Trust - Exact was launched today as a pilot program in Kingston. 
Bell Canada, working closely with Northern Telecom, is developing screen-based telephones
and converted telephones, to be used later in the trial.  Any Bank of Montreal, TD Bank or
Canada Trust customer in Kingston can get an Exact card now.

<P>&quot;Exact is an extremely convenient way to pay for frequent, low cost
purchases,&quot; says Ron Mckerlie, Vice President Electronic Banking Services, Bank of
Montreal. &quot;It gives you a new way to pay for purchases you normally make with cash...
such as a jug of milk at the local convenience store, your morning coffee and bagel, a burger
at lunch, video rentals, and more.&quot;

<P>&quot;With Exact you don't have to carry as many small bills and coins, and you'll
always have the exact change required to make fast, convenient purchases,&quot; adds Ron
Hodges, Vice President Card and Direct Services, TD Bank. &quot;The Exact card can be
loaded to a maximum of $200, but we expect the bulk of transactions will be for small value
purchases.  Merchants will find they are able to serve their customers faster and safely and
securely make deposits into their business accounts.&quot;


<h4>Canadians Spend Big on Small Purchases</h4>
A recent survey from the Interac Association shows that 22 per cent of all consumer
expenditures total less than $20, the bulk of which are made with cash.  Canadian consumers
now spend between $40 and $60 billion annually using small bills and coins.  Canadians are
also the second largest users of plastic cards in the world.



<P>&quot;With Exact, we now have a great new alternative to cash, credit and debit
cards.&quot; says Tim Hockey, Vice President Core Banking Services, Canada Trust. 
&quot;Technology is rapidly changing the face of money, providing faster, easier and more
secure transactions.  This is only the beginning&quot;.

<h4>Canada: Plastic Lovers Paradise</h4>
Canadians now carry an estimated 46.2 million debit and credit cards issued by financial 
institutions and the use of debit cards grew 43 per cent in the last year.  As a nation, we have
embraced new technologies and methods of payments.

<P>Ninety-seven per cent of Canadians prefer cash for purchases under $10, however 41
per cent say they are very interested in using new payment technologies.  In addition, 54 per
cent of Canadians say convenience is the most important thing they consider when deciding
how to pay for purchases.

<h4>Quick, Easy to Use</h4>
Exact is a convenient plastic card that takes only seconds to load with money.  How? It's as
easy as visiting your local Bank of Montreal, TD Bank or Canada Trust branch.  A customer
service officer will issue your Exact card and help you load up the first time.  You can reload
at any Exact load terminal located beside the ABM machines of participating financial
institutions in Kingston.  All Kingston branches of the three participating financial institutions
have Exact load terminals.  You can also load Exact cards in local malls, student campuses,
and at selected merchant locations.

<P>Making a purchase with Exact is just as easy.  The customer inserts his/her card into the
merchant's Exact purchase terminal; the merchant enters the purchase price and the customer
presses  'OK'.  The electronic value of the purchase is collected in the merchant's purchase
terminal throughout the day and is deposited safely and directly to the merchant's account
through phone lines by modem.

<P>To check the balance left on their Exact card, a customer simply pushes a yellow button
on the Exact purchase terminal marked  '?', and the remaining balance on the card is
immediately displayed. &quot;My customers and staff are just going to love this,&quot; says
James Brown, President of Browns Fine Foods in Kingston. &quot;It will mean instant
payment at most of our Kingston cafeterias and no more delays and searching for small
change.  We are thrilled to join our fellow merchants and customers in The Greater Kingston
Area to help launch this very timely pilot project.&quot;

<P>&quot;This is the first comprehensive North American trial of new technology that has
proven successful and is currently in use in several European countries, Brazil and
Australia,&quot; says Mr. Hockey.  Exact technology was invented by Banksys, the
Belgium-based equivalent to Interac.  &quot;Exact is a significant leap forward in the evolution
of
electronic payment systems.&quot;




<h4>Low Cost to Use Less Cash</h4>
Bank of Montreal, TD Bank and Canada Trust will offer the Exact card at no charge for an
introductory period and then each financial institution will determine pricing for its own
customers.

<P>Nearly 600 Kingston merchants have signed on with Exact.  These merchants include
barbers, libraries, convenience stores, dry cleaners, video stores, fast food and coffee shops,
florists, gas stations, grocery stores, toy and gift stores, taxis, pharmacies, student campuses
and restaurants.

<h3>Release Publication<br>Monday, December 9, 1996</h3>
<h2>News Release - Communique</h2>

<h3>Federation of Saskatchewan Indian Nations and The Toronto-Dominion Bank
Officially Launch First Nations Bank of Canada</h3>

<h4>Prime Minister Jean Chretien attends ceremony to launch  first Canadian bank with
Aboriginal Sponsorship</h4>

<P><b>TORONTO</b> - The Federation of Saskatchewan Indian Nations, Inc. and The
Toronto-Dominion Bank announced today that letters patent incorporating the First Nations
Bank of Canada have been received and the application for membership with the Canada Deposit
Insurance Corporation (CDIC) has been approved.  The First Nations Bank of Canada is a
Schedule II chartered bank serving Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people across Canada.

<P>The first branch of the bank will open its doors in Saskatoon in early 1997, providing a broad
range of personal and business banking services.  By early 1997, the First Nations Bank of
Canada will be ready to provide services nationally to customers through TD's branches across
the country and the TD Access network of automated teller machines, telephone banking, and PC
banking.

<P>The Toronto-Dominion Bank has invested $8 million in start-up capital to create the bank
with an additional $2 million from the Saskatchewan Indian Equity Foundation, owned by the
Federation of Saskatchewan Indian Nations.  Within 10 years, The Toronto-Dominion Bank's
investment will be repaid, and, subject to regulatory approval, the First Nations Bank of Canada
will be operated entirely by Canada's Aboriginal people.

<P>In a ceremony at the top of the Toronto Dominion Tower overlooking the heart of Canada's
financial district, Chief Blaine Favel of the Federation of Saskatchewan Indian Nations said:
&quot;For the first time, Canada's First Nations are entering a new frontier of the economy in
which we have yet to play a leadership role -- the financial sector.&quot;

<P>The First Nations Bank of Canada has already received a very positive reception from other
First Nations bands outside Saskatchewan who are interested in becoming customers and
shareholders.  "The Indian economy alone in Canada represents billions of dollars. ... As First
Nations continue to negotiate land claims settlements representing millions of dollars, we'll be
competing -- we believe successfully -- for this business," said Chief Favel.

<P>&quot;From day one, our decision to participate has been a business decision,&quot;
stressed Richard Thomson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of The Toronto-Dominion
Bank. &quot;This is the key reason we became involved.  We believe that the First Nations Bank
of Canada has a competitive advantage in a market with solid business potential.&quot;

<P>Under the terms of this co-operative effort, the Saskatchewan Indian Equity Foundation will
receive 75 per cent of the operating profits, which will be reinvested into the bank.  The Toronto-Dominion Bank will receive 25 per cent of the operating profits over the next 10 years until its
$8 million investment is repaid.

<P>&quot;This is a great day for all First Nations and aboriginal peoples in Canada,&quot; said
Prime Minister Jean Chretien, a special guest at the ceremony, which featured blessings from two
First Nations elders, performances from the Sweetgrass drummers and six singers/dancers from
other Saskatchewan First Nations Bands.

<P>Prior to the creation of the First Nations Bank of Canada, The Federation of Saskatchewan
Indian Nations provided term loans valued at more than $30 million to First Nations businesses
in Saskatchewan since 1982 through the Saskatchewan Indian Equity Foundation.  According to
Chief Favel, this new bank &quot;will offer service to customers across Canada without the
capital burden of bricks and mortar.&quot;

<P>Chief Favel continued, &quot;This is a major step towards economic self-determination for
Canada's First Nations.  The First Nations Bank of Canada will help foster economic growth and
job creation for our people, while generating profits for Aboriginal and non-aboriginal
investors.&quot;

<P>The Federation of Saskatchewan Indian Nations is one of the largest organizations of its type
in Canada, representing 73 First Nations in Saskatchewan.  The Federation has a philosophy of
building sustainable institutions, and was instrumental in the founding of Canada's only First
Nations controlled university, the Saskatchewan Indian Federated College in Regina.

News Release - Communique</H2>

<H3>TD BANK REPORTS PROFITS OF $914 MILLION FOR 1996</H3>

<P><b>TORONTO</b> - Toronto Dominion Bank today announced net income of $249 million
or $.81 per common share for the fourth quarter of 1996, up from $226 million or $.72 per share
the prior year.  This brought net income for the year to $914 million - up by 15% from 1995,
while net income per common share reached $2.95, an increase of 18%.  Return on equity for
1996 was 15.4% for the year, compared to 14.3% in 1995.

<p>TD also announced an increase of 12 per cent or three cents (3&#162;) per share in its
quarterly
dividend, the fourth dividend increase in the last three years.  A dividend at the rate of
twenty-eight cents (28&#162;) per fully paid common share in the capital stock of the Bank has
been
declared
for the quarter ending January 31, 1997, payable on and after January 31, 1997, to shareholders
of record at the close of business on December 19, 1996.

<P>Results for the year reflected strong growth in other income, with significant gains achieved
by TD's investment banking, brokerage and mutual funds businesses.  The loan loss provision
was reduced to $152 million for the year, the lowest level in over a decade.

<P>&quot;With a solid financial performance and progress in developing our businesses, TD
had a positive impact on the Canadian economy in 1996,&quot; said TD's Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Richard M. Thomson, citing returns to shareholders, products and services
developed to meet customers' needs, taxes paid by the Bank as one of the country's largest
taxpayers, and business financing that generated economic growth.

<P>During the fourth quarter, TD made further progress with its strategies for growth as the
Bank:
<ul>
<li>completed the acquisition of Waterhouse Investor Services, Inc., the fourth largest discount
broker in the United States.

<li>listed TD common shares on the New York Stock Exchange, broadening access for investors
and improving liquidity for TD's shares in the United States.

<li>launched TD Access: PC, North America's first fully integrated computer banking and
brokerage PC service.

<li>introduced two new U.S. mutual funds - the Green Line Health Sciences Fund and the US
Blue Chip Equity Fund - both managed by T. Rowe Price, a leading American fund manager. 
The launch was the most successful ever for a no-load fund in Canada.

<li>launched Green Line Investor Services' WebBroker - providing securities trading on the
Internet for the first time in Canada. 

<li>announced plans in association with the Saskatchewan Indian Equity Foundation to form
First Nations Bank of Canada.

<li>received approval to open a representative office in Jakarta, Indonesia.</ul>

<P>TD's stock performed particularly well during the quarter, reflecting the fundamental value
of TD, the banking sector and the economic strength of Canada in general.  

<P>Investor confidence in Canada has been enhanced by the successful efforts of the federal
government and provincial governments to reduce deficits - which we hope will continue until
all governments have balanced their budgets.

<P>According to TD President A. Charles Baillie, the current low level of interest rates should
result in increased economic activity in Canada in 1997 and the gradual return of consumer
confidence.  

<p>&quot;We expect the low interest rate environment will increase demand for investment
vehicles other than deposit products.  With the acceleration of growth in investment banking,
brokerage, mutual funds, investment management and electronic banking services, TD is
positioned to perform well in this environment.&quot;

                  <h3><center>REVIEW OF OPERATING PERFORMANCE</center></h3>
Record earnings were achieved by the Bank in the fourth quarter and for the full year 1996. 
Net income for the quarter of $249 million was 10% or $23 million higher than last year and
11% or $26 million higher than the third quarter of 1996.  This performance resulted from
record other income and strong net interest income, which increased 19% and 8%,
respectively from last year.  The stock price was up 32% over the past year to $31.35 as at
October 31, 1996 and has done well subsequently.

<P>On October 15th the acquisition of Waterhouse Investor Services, Inc. was completed. In
conjunction with this acquisition, 16.7 million common shares were issued.  During the
quarter, the Bank repurchased 6 million common shares, bringing the total repurchased in
1996 to 16.1 million.  As a result of this activity, the average number of shares outstanding
during the quarter was less than last year and the previous quarter.  This, coupled with record
earnings, generated record net income per share of  $ .81 versus $ .72  a year ago and $ .73
in the third quarter of 1996.  On a fully diluted basis, net income per share was $ .79
compared to $ .71 a year ago and last quarter.

<P>Strong earnings combined with modest growth in equity led to an improvement in the return
on common equity from 15.8% to 16.3% this quarter compared to last year.  As the growth
rate for assets, mainly marketable securities and securities purchased under resale agreements,
was higher than that for earnings, return on assets declined from .86% last year to .82% this
quarter.

<P>For 1996, the Bank earned net income of $914 million, a $120 million or 15% increase from
$794 million in 1995.  Earnings per share, on a fully diluted basis, were $2.89 in 1996 versus
$2.48 in 1995.

<h3>Net Interest Income</h3>
<P>Compared to the same quarter last year, the Bank experienced growth of 8% to $690 million
in net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis this quarter. This increase resulted from a
14% increase in average earning assets to $108 billion, partly offset by a 13 basis point
decline in net interest margin to 2.53%. The decline in margin was due to the growth of very
low margin securities purchased under resale agreements, which as a proportion of the Bank's
total average earning assets grew from 6% last year to 11% this year.  This change in asset
mix had a 14 basis point unfavourable impact on the Bank's margin.

<P>A positive development in the quarter was the 4 basis point improvement in net interest
margin compared to the prior quarter, as the Bank was positioned for a decline in interest
rates.  An increase in margin together with a 3% growth in average earning assets, primarily
from increased lending activity, resulted in a 4% increase in net interest income to $690
million. 
                                                                     
<P>The Bank continued to benefit from favourable equity market conditions and realized $28
million in net investment securities gains in the quarter, the eighth consecutive quarter of
gains in excess of $20 million.
                                
<h3>Credit quality and provision for credit losses</h3>
Net impaired loans during the quarter decreased $95 million to $344 million at 
October 31, 1996.  This decline was largely due to improvement in real estate loans to
corporate borrowers.  Net impaired loans as a percentage of total loans and bankers'
acceptances declined from .5% last quarter to .4% at year end.

<P>As a result of this improvement in credit quality, the provision for credit losses for 1996 was
reduced in the quarter to $152 million from the prior quarters' estimate of $170 million, and
from $180 million in 1995.  Losses of $128 million were expensed in the first three quarters
resulting in $24 million being included in the fourth quarter results.

<h3>Other income</h3>
Other income reached a new record level during the quarter.  At $444 million, other income
was $44 million higher than the previous record set in the second quarter of this year.  It was
up $70 million or 19% from the fourth quarter of 1995 and $50 million or 13% from last
quarter. 

<P>Other income for the quarter included a $27 million gain from the sale of the Bank's
institutional and pension custody business to Royal Trust.

<P>Excluding this one-time gain, the year-over-year increase in total other income was
generated
by growth in investment and securities services revenue which increased 61%.  The Bank has
made substantial ongoing investments in TD Securities which provides integrated investment
banking, merchant banking, fixed income, institutional equities, and brokerage services to the
Bank's customers.  This has enabled the Bank to  meet the changing financial requirements of our
retail and wholesale customers.  Low interest rates and buoyant equity markets during the quarter
resulted in increased usage  by our customers of the expanded services offered by TD Securities
and the Bank's mutual funds management business.

<h3>Non-interest expenses</h3>
The Bank's productivity ratio improved from 62.5% in the same quarter last year to 
62.0% this quarter.  This improvement was the result of the strong growth in total revenue of
12% exceeding the 11% increase in non-interest expenses.  Of the increase in expenses, 8% is
attributable to continued expansion and increased activity of our securities businesses and to
performance related compensation.  The remainder of the increase was largely due to further
investment in convenient electronic services and to costs related to the establishment of a
company to "co-source" document processing services with two other banks.

<h3>Balance Sheet</h3>
At October 31, 1996,  total assets were $126 billion, an increase of $17 billion or 16% over a
year ago largely due to higher levels of securities and cash resources resulting from increased
trading activity.  On October 15th, the Bank completed the purchase of Waterhouse Investor
Services, Inc. which increased the Bank's assets by $2.5 billion, consisting mainly of $1.0
billion in securities, $.7 billion in loans to individuals and 
U.S.$390 million in goodwill to be amortized over 20 years.  Both the net income 
contributed by Waterhouse and the amortization of goodwill will start to be reflected in the
Bank's results in fiscal 1997.  In addition, the decline in interest rates has had a 
positive impact on the housing market and residential mortgages increased $2.3 billion or 9%
from last year.  Business lending activity increased 6% from a year ago, but 
only modestly from last quarter.

<P>The acquisition of Waterhouse accounted for $1.2 billion of the $2 billion increase in
personal
non-term deposits.  Strong growth of $3.7 billion in mutual funds managed by the Bank in
Canada, together with $2.6 billion increase from the purchase of 
Waterhouse, led to a doubling of mutual funds managed by the Bank from $5.8 billion last
year end to $12.1 billion at October 31, 1996.  During the quarter, the Health Sciences Fund
and the U.S. Blue Chip Equity Fund were added to TD's Green Line Family of No-Load
Mutual Funds, which now total 33.

<P>As a result of a further decline in market interest rates and continued strong equities markets,
the market value of the Bank's securities portfolios held for investment and liquidity purposes
at October 31, 1996 was $213 million above book value, compared to $40 million below book
value at October 31, 1995.                                  

<h3>Capital</h3>
Although total common equity increased $399 million during the quarter, on a net of goodwill
basis, it declined $123 million.   Increases in equity due to $164 million in earnings after
dividends and the issuance of 16.7 million common shares for a value of $459 million in
respect of the purchase of Waterhouse, were more than offset by the $522 million reduction
related to the goodwill from the Waterhouse acquisition, the $179 million reduction related to
the ongoing share buy back program and $48 million of unrealized foreign currency
translation losses.  The Bank intends to repurchase up to 30 million common shares, subject to
the continued maintenance of adequate capital ratios.  Compared to last quarter end,
risk-weighted assets increased $2.7 billion, primarily
due to the purchase of Waterhouse and the change in mix of securities holdings.  With these
changes, the ratio of net common equity to risk-weighted assets declined to 6.2% from 6.6%
at the previous quarter end and 6.7% a year ago.

<H3>TD BANK LOWERS ITS EMERALD VISA CARD RATE, AS PART OF ITS
PROMISE OF HAVING THE LOWEST CREDIT CARD RATE IN CANADA</H3>
<P>
<b>TORONTO</b> - As part of its public promise to have the lowest Visa card rate in
Canada, TD Bank today announced it is cutting the rate on its TD EMERALD Visa Card to 
9.25 per cent from 9.9 per cent effective December 1, 1996. 

<p>&quot;This is the second time in as many months that TD Bank has taken a leadership
role with Visa rates,&quot; says Barb Cromb, Associate Vice President, Card and Direct
Services Division. &quot;With the continuing decline in the bank rate, we felt it was time to
pass along further savings to our customers.&quot;

<p>With the lowest credit card rate in Canada, TD EMERALD is the best alternative for
customers who are looking for a low rate card.  TD EMERALD carries a fully refundable
annual fee of $12 comparing favourably to other low rate credit cards.

 ATTITUDES TOWARD THE CANADIAN BANKING INDUSTRY MUST CHANGE --
SAYS TD PRESIDENT 
</H3>
<P>
<b>OTTAWA</b> -  There has to be a change in attitude towards the banking sector. 
"Banking in this country is a matter of strategic national interest. It should be clear to anyone
who has bothered to look closely at the trends and the facts that there is dramatic improvement
going on," said Toronto Dominion Bank President Charles Baillie in his remarks to the
Ottawa-Carleton Board of Trade luncheon today.

<p>Baillie challenged common perceptions about banking, "Now, we do not pretend that
'what's good for the banks is good for the country'.  Nor do we believe it is responsible to
encourage an attitude that what's good for the banks must automatically be bad for the
country."  

<p>The TD President, who will take over as CEO in February 1997, questioned those who
have negative attitudes toward banks without having all the facts at hand.  "What's bad when
the more profits we make, the more taxes we pay, and the more taxes we pay, the higher the
level of community and support services our country is able to provide; and the more we are
able to lend, supporting the economy and the creation of jobs?" asked Baillie.  

<P>"What's bad about the tax contribution we make, when despite the fact that we earn
4 per cent of corporate profits in this country, we pay 12 per cent of corporate taxes?  In fact,
the banks paid more than $3.7 billion in taxes in 1995," he added.
                              
<P>Mr. Baillie highlighted the banks' record on jobs, noting that in a time of downsizing,
employment in the Canadian banking sector actually increased over the past five years,
"Today, if you include all the banks and their subsidiaries, we employ over 206,000 people." 

<p>Baillie emphasised the banking industry's increasing responsiveness to the needs of small
business. "I believe a true sea-change is now underway in the attitude and behaviour of banks
towards small business.  Why?  Not because of piety or political pressure -- and not because
the banks see this as part of being good corporate citizens.  This is a straightforward bottom-line development:  small business is big business for the banks," he said. 

<p>"The fact is, every single bank in the country is broadening and deepening the small
business services, products and expertise it provides," said Baillie. "Ninety-four per cent of
the banks' business clients are small business."

<P>Baillie cited one of TD Bank's new services as evidence. "For example, TD Access,
North America's first comprehensive, integrated computer-based home banking service, will
lower small business costs and allow them, through one gateway, to conduct all personal and
business banking as well as use our discount brokerage service."

<P>"This country faces enough challenge as it is.  A healthy financial sector is essential to
meeting those challenges, including the needs of small business.  Strong and healthy banks
benefit from a strong and healthy country.  But so too a strong and healthy country requires
strong and healthy banks," concluded TD Bank President Baillie.

 THREE BANKS CHOOSE NEW CEO AND CORPORATE NAME FOR THEIR
JOINTLY OWNED DOCUMENT-PROCESSING COMPANY
</H3>
<P>
<B>TORONTO</B> - Bank of Montreal, Royal Bank of Canada and Toronto Dominion Bank
today announced that they have chosen the name Symcor Services Inc. for the company they set
up this summer to handle document-processing for the three banks.

<P>Symcor is viewed as the banks' 'made-in-Canada' response to the competition posed by the
big U.S. out-sourcing companies which are trying to attract business from Canadian financial
institutions.  Their response is one that the three banks feel will, in the long run, help to preserve
jobs in Canada and create competitive Canadian business solutions.

<p>Symcor's Board of Directors today also announced the appointment of <b>Pierre
Gravelle</b> as the company's new Chief Executive Officer and President.  Mr. Gravelle is
currently Deputy Minister of National Revenue, Customs, Excise, GST and Taxation, for the
Government of Canada.

<p>In his nearly ten years as Deputy Minister of the department, Mr. Gravelle has succeeded in
transforming Canada's national revenue administration into one of the most modern, progressive,
client-centred and technologically advanced tax, border and trade administrations in the
industrialized world.  To do this, he oversaw the largest merger and consolidation of departments
in Canada's public sector (the merger in 1992 of Customs & Excise with Taxation) and the
introduction of information technology that vaulted the department into a full EDI (electronic
data interchange) environment.

<p>Collectively, the Ministry handles hundreds of millions of transactions annually in collecting
tax revenues, processing international trade, and administering social and economic benefits
payments.

<p>&quot;Mr. Gravelle brings precisely the experience and skills we need to build Canada's
foremost document-processing company,&quot; said Duncan Gibson, Chairman of the Board of
Symcor, who is also Executive Vice President, Operations for TD Bank. &quot;We are delighted
that he is our new CEO.&quot;

<p>Mr. Gravelle assumes his new position on December 16.

<P>With the appointment of a CEO, Symcor is ready to move ahead with its plans early in the
new year, although the Board stressed that the transfer of business from the banks to Symcor will
be phased in over the next two to three years.

<P>The choice of the name for the new company is an important milestone in the process.  The
name <i>Symcor</i> suggests symmetry, according to the banks, which is what they expect to
achieve when they bring together best practices from three organizations.  The banks have
stressed that Symcor will have the scale to allow the banks to meet their North American
competition head on.

 TD ASSET MANAGEMENT INC. LAUNCHES &quot;WOMEN IN THE KNOW&quot; - 
THE BOOK INFORMING WOMEN HOW TO BUILD A STRATEGY TO ACHIEVE
FINANCIAL SUCCESS</H3>
<P>
<B>TORONTO</B> -TD Asset Management Inc.(TDAM) today announced the launch of a
new  introductory investment workbook to further extend the investment knowledge of
Canadian  women entitled, <b>Women In The Know: How to Build a Strategy to Achieve
Financial Success,</b>  published by Key Porter Books of Toronto.

<P>The book, co-authored by Janice Book, Sandy Cimoroni and Susan Swayze of TDAM,
was written due to the overwhelmingly positive response to TDAM's Women In The Know
(WITK) program launched in October 1994.  To augment the existing national program, the
book mirrors and further expands on the free seminar given by Women In The Know
managers who address the needs, concerns and unique financial circumstances of women 
in the  90s.

<P>&quot;The genesis of this book came from witnessing the extraordinary interest and
incredible desire for investment knowledge on the part of more than 30,000 Canadian women
who have participated in our seminar program&quot; said Janice Book, Managing Director of
TDAM and founder of the program and co-author of the book. &quot;The facts clearly
illustrate that women today are still dealing with issues similar to those of previous generations
such as the gap in male and female mortality and the differences in income generated by men
versus women.&quot;

                                

<p>&quot;There are, however, other factors today that must be considered such as divorce
rates, the needs of single parents and the increased number of women in the workforce,&quot;
Book continued. &quot;This book offers a quick, jargon-free study that aims to increase the
investment confidence of its readers.&quot;

<p>The book concentrates on the fundamentals of money management and describes the
tools necessary to assess each reader's financial status including how much they have available
to save, completion of a cash in/out-flow worksheet and review of a net worth statement.  In
addition, the book offers a step-by-step investment assessment of the reader to determine the
most appropriate path for building a successful personal investment portfolio.

<p>TDAM's Women In The Know seminar program continues across Canada through local TD
branches.  The book, Women In The Know: How to Build a Strategy to Achieve Financial
Success, 
available in paperback, sells for $19.95 at local bookstores or can be ordered by calling 
1-888-465-6615 (shipping and handling apply).

<h3>Release Publication<br>Tuesday, November 12, 1996</h3>
<h2>News Release - Communique</h2>

<h3>TWO NEW TD GREEN LINE FUNDS ATTRACT INVESTOR INTEREST</h3>

<P><b>TORONTO</b> - As a result of a first-ever pre-launch early subscription for TD plus
the power of the T. Rowe Price name, TD Asset Management Inc. today announced that the
Green Line Health Sciences Fund has surpassed all records for the launch of any new Green
Line Fund.

<P>More than $35 million has already been invested by Canadians in the T. Rowe Price-advised Green Line Health Sciences fund.  Launched at the same time with the same adviser,
the U.S. Blue Chip Equity Fund has attracted in excess of $15 million.  Both funds were
formally introduced for public sale on October 31, 1996.

<P>&quot;It's clear that Canadian investors want to capitalize on the reputation, strength
and international success of T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc., whose expertise is only offered in

<h2>News Release - Communique</h2>

<h3> TORONTO DOMINION BANK PARTICIPATES IN &QUOT;TAKE YOUR KIDS TO
WORK&QUOT; DAY</h3>

<P><b>TORONTO</b> - Toronto Dominion Bank is pleased to announce its participation in 
<i>Take Your Kids To Work</i> day to be held November 6, 1996 for grade 9 students
across Ontario, Manitoba and the Northwest Territories and in some areas in the Maritime and
Prairie provinces.  This is the first year the program is being extended to students outside of
Ontario by their school boards.

<p>This year, parents, guardians or volunteer hosts from approximately 500 TD branches
and offices are bringing their &quot;kids&quot; to work.  Students will have the opportunity
to experience first hand the day-to-day work routine of their host.  With the expansion of the
program into other provinces this year, TD has approximately 500 grade 9 students
participating. 

<P><i>Take Your Kids to Work</i> is organized by The Learning Partnership, a non-profit
organization of business people, educators and community leaders.  The program
encourages a proactive partnership among educators, businesses, parents or guardians and
students.  The program allows students to job-shadow their host, giving them the opportunity
to observe, ask questions, interact with and interview co-workers and attend meetings.

<P>The overall purpose of the program is to further enhance and expand students'
understanding of the skills they will need to develop including self discipline, time
management, teamwork as well as individual work.  The program is designed to introduce
students to different career options and to help them better understand the choices they have as
they establish their career goals.

<p><i>&quot;Take Your Kids to Work</i> day provides students with a wonderful
opportunity to visit the workplace with their parent or guardian.  It gives them the opportunity
to see and hopefully understand the importance of making and achieving career goals,&quot;
says Rosemary Regan, Vice President, Employee Relations. &quot;Because of its success in
past years, we continue to involve TD employees in the program as it expands across Canada
so that these young people can benefit from the learning experience.&quot; 

<P>&quot;This program is designed to directly link classroom lessons to real world
experience, and will help them understand the importance of continuous lifelong
learning,&quot; adds Regan.

<h3>HOW TO INVEST FOR THE BEST IN THE U.S.</h3>

<p><i>Two new additions to US arsenal of TD's Green Line Family of No-Load
Mutual Funds offer even broader potential</i>

<P><b>TORONTO</b> - Adding to its already strong array of US mutual fund investment
alternatives that cover burgeoning American markets, TD Asset Management Inc. today
announced the introduction of <b>two new US funds</b> advised by one of the most
experienced and innovative American fund managers, T. Rowe Price: <b>The Green Line Health
Sciences Fund and US Blue Chip Equity Fund.</b>

<p>&quot;If you're looking to invest in the US, our Green Line funds offer many choices to
take you where you want to go,&quot; says Mark Wettlaufer, President, TD Asset
Management. &quot;We provide exclusive Canadian access to the fund management expertise
of T. Rowe Price and our US Index Fund tracking the S & P 500 Total Return Index is not
only an excellent performer, it also has the lowest management expense ratio of its
competitors.&quot;

<p>The new Green Line funds as well as the Green Line Science and Technology Fund -- a
leading performer in Canada since its inception -- mirror similar comparable funds in the US
managed by T. Rowe Price.  The firm was recently named US Equity Fund Manager Of The
Year by <i>Morningstar,</i> a major U.S. fund research authority.

<p>The only US no-load investment alternative in the health sciences sector in Canada, The
Green Line Health Sciences Fund invests primarily in high-growth U.S. companies such as
Health Management Organizations (HMOs), biotechnology corporations, laboratory equipment
suppliers and healthcare information systems.

<P>On the heels of T. Rowe Price's equity management success exemplified by the Green
Line North American Growth Fund's performance, the new large-cap US Blue Chip Equity
Fund also mirrors the comparable T. Rowe Price fund in the US -- owner of a five-star
Morningstar rating -- and should prove attractive to Canadian investors seeking long-term
growth of capital through well-established, high-quality US companies.

<P>TD Asset Management Inc. (TDAM) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of The
Toronto-Dominion Bank.  TDAM currently manages $18 billion for mutual funds, pension
funds,
corporations, institutions, endowments, foundations and high net worth individuals.

<h2>News Release - Communique</h2>



<h3>TD INVESTS IN CANADA'S YOUTH WITH BURSARY PROGRAM AIMED AT
IMPROVING ACCESS TO EDUCATION</h3>

<P><b>TORONTO</b> - TD Bank has announced a bursary program designed to improve
access to post secondary education in Canada by providing assistance to students across
Canada.  This represents a major departure in the Bank's corporate donations program, which
has traditionally channelled its education giving -- representing about 20% of TD's donations
budget -- to capital projects at universities and colleges.

<p>According to TD president Charles Baillie, the Bank is responding to the fundamental
changes in post secondary education in an era of cutbacks and upward pressure on fees and
other costs for students.  

<p>&quot;One of the great strengths has been our access to higher education,&quot; Baillie
said. &quot;We need that strength more than ever now in the new global knowledge economy. 
That is why we are shifting our education donations to the students themselves -- to intellectual

<h3>Release Publication<br>Tuesday, October 22, 1996</h3>
<h2>News Release - Communique</h2>

<h3>CANADIAN ECONOMY TO STRENGTHEN, HELPED BY CONTINUED LOW
INTEREST RATES </h3>

<P><b>TORONTO</b> - The Canadian economy strengthened in the third quarter of 1996
and is expected to continue to pick up steam as the year comes to a close. &quot;We have seen
a significant improvement from the weak economic performance registered earlier in the
year,&quot; says Ruth Getter, Senior Vice President and Chief Economist at TD Bank. 
According to the <i>TD Quarterly Economic Report</i> released today, although growth
for 1996 as a whole is expected to average only 1.6 per cent, the Canadian economy will put
in a much better performance in 1997, with growth averaging close to 3 per cent.

<P>TD economists expect that the Canadian expansion will be more balanced over the 1997-98
forecast period than in recent years. &quot;Helped by interest rates which have fallen to
30-year lows, consumers are beginning to spend more on goods and services, including cars
and light trucks, as well as on new and resale homes,&quot; says Dr. Getter.  At the same
time, &quot;Canada's competitive export-oriented industries will continue to perform well
over the next few years.&quot;

<P><b>U.S. Economic Outlook</b><br>
According to Dr. Getter, &quot;economic growth in the United States has begun to slow and
will shift to a more sustainable pace of about 2 per cent throughout 1997-98.  The rate of
inflation should remain steady -- at about 3 per cent.&quot;

<p>&quot;With  U.S. economic growth moderating, and with inflation remaining under
control, we do not expect the Federal Reserve to make any significant changes in monetary
policy over the forecast period,&quot; says Dr. Getter.

<P><b>Canada's Interest Rate Outlook</b><br>
Dr. Getter noted that &quot;there has been a dramatic shift of sentiment in international
financial markets in favour of Canada this year, which has led to the recent appreciation of the
Canadian dollar in spite of a sharp drop in Canadian interest rates.&quot;  Three factors have
contributed to this improvement:  Canada's superior inflation performance; Canadian
governments' marked progress towards deficit elimination; and third, the surplus that has been
achieved in Canada's international current account in recent months.  These favourable trends
will support a gradual rise in the dollar to about 75-76 U.S. cents over the medium term.

<p>The Bank of Canada, which has cut interest rates aggressively throughout this year, is
not expected to ease monetary conditions further.  Nonetheless, if the Canadian dollar
continues to appreciate, the Bank of Canada will likely cut interest rates again to keep
monetary conditions unchanged.

<p>Canadian interest rates (for maturities of up to 10 years) are now at or below comparable
U.S. rates, and the negative spreads on short- and medium-term rates have widened sharply in
recent months.  At the same time, long-term (30-year) bond-yield spreads have narrowed
significantly.  Over the forecast period Canada-U.S. interest-rate spreads are likely to remain
fairly close to current levels.

<p><b>Canada's Regional Outlook</b><br>
&quot;Healthy conditions in the oilpatch and a rise in crop production will place Alberta in the
lead in provincial economic growth this year,&quot; say TD economists.  Higher crop
production will also contribute to the above-average performances in Saskatchewan and
Manitoba this year.  Ontario's economy will also outperform the national average, led by
further gains in manufacturing activity and a strong rebound in housing activity.  British
Columbia and Quebec will record below-average growth, hampered by weak conditions in the
pulp and paper industries.  Economic performances in the Atlantic provinces will range from
modest growth in Prince Edward Island this year to a decline in activity in Newfoundland.

<P>According to TD economists, &quot;a strong showing by the manufacturing sector will
propel Ontario back into the top growth spot in 1997.&quot;  Above-average growth will also
be recorded in British Columbia next year, as the pulp and paper industry recovers.  Economic
performances in the remaining provinces will range from a healthy expansion in Alberta to a
slight decline in activity in Prince Edward Island, as work on the fixed-link bridge is
completed.

<h3>Release Publication<br>Tuesday, October 15, 1996</h3>
<h2>News Release - Communique</h2>

<h3>TORONTO DOMINION BANK AND WATERHOUSE INVESTOR SERVICES,
INC. CLOSE MERGER</h3>

<P><b>Toronto/New York</b> - W. Keith Gray, Executive Vice President of TD Bank and
Chairman of Green Line Investor Services and Lawrence M. Waterhouse Jr., Chairman and
founder of Waterhouse Investor Services are pleased to announce to customers and TD Bank
shareholders in both Canada and the United States that today's closing of the merger represents a
new and exciting era in discount brokerage.  

<p>Green Line in Canada and Waterhouse in the United States have been leaders in discount
brokerage for years.  Together, they have over 1,000,000 customers and would now constitute
the third largest discount broker in the world.

<P>&quot;We will be able to deliver a broad range of integrated investment services to our
customers in Canada and the United States.&quot;  said Keith Gray. &quot;While Green Line
customers can now get remote access from the United States to their accounts through our 1-800
numbers, we will develop a seamless, cross-border approach to service that ultimately allows us
to offer Canadians the option of accessing services through Waterhouse branches in the United
States.&quot;  

<P>&quot;This is an exciting, growing business and this venture is one through which we will
exemplify our promise to customers to help make it easier to meet their financial goals.&quot;  
Mr. Waterhouse  said, &quot; Joining forces with TD Bank and Green Line allows us to
enhance significantly our technology and delivery systems and helps us meet our goal of growing
to 200 branches by the year 2000.  This strategy will enable us to have a presence that puts us
within 25 miles of approximately ninety per cent of the U.S. population.&quot;  

<P>&quot;Waterhouse Investor Services, Inc. has almost 1700 associates in 90 branches
throughout the United States who are looking forward to meeting existing and future customers'
needs with the resources of TD Bank,&quot; he added.

<P>Established in 1984, Green Line Investor Services is Canada's largest and most successful
discount broker.  Green Line is a professional source of information for the retail investor that
executes trades in stocks, bonds, mutual funds, options and other financial instruments at
discount commission rates of up to 88 per cent less than traditional full service brokers.  TD
Bank is North America's 14th largest bank with assets of over C$119 billion.

<p><b>TD Bank Common Shares Issued in Connection with Merger</b>

<p>Waterhouse shareholders received consideration equal to US$38 per Waterhouse share. 
Waterhouse shareholders who elected to receive TD common stock were not subject to proration
and are receiving 1.87046 TD common shares for each Waterhouse share for which an election
was made, with fractional shares paid in cash.  All Waterhouse shareholders who did not elect to
receive TD common stock were subject to proration and are receiving  67.14162 per cent in cash
and the remainder in TD common stock with fractional shares paid in cash.

<P>TD Bank expects to issue approximately 16.7 million common shares as part of the merger
transaction.  TD Bank had previously initiated a common share re-purchase program.  To date,
16.1 million common shares had been re-purchased under it.

<h3>Release Publication<br>Friday, October 11, 1996</h3>
<h2>News Release - Communique</h2>

<h3>TD BANK INTRODUCES TD GIC PLUS - A GIC
WITH THE ADDED FEATURE OF POTENTIAL STOCK MARKET GAINS</h3>


<P><b>TORONTO</b> - Committed to offering Canadian investors choice and flexibility
in their investment options, Toronto Dominion Bank today introduced TD GIC PLUS, offered
at branches beginning October 15, 1996.  The attractive feature that sets TD GIC PLUS apart
from other guaranteed investment products is the potential to earn a bonus interest payment
based on the performance of the TSE 100 Index.  Available as both a registered or non-registered
product, TD GIC PLUS offers a guaranteed annual rate of interest for the full term
selected, either 3 or 5 years. 

<p>&quot;Feedback from our customers shows that they want an option that will maximize
returns without giving up the security that a GIC offers.  TD GIC PLUS is the perfect
investment vehicle for those investors who are looking for an opportunity to earn the higher
returns associated with the stock market without risking their principal and with at least a
minimum return on their savings,&quot; says Catherine Taylor, Associate Vice President,
Personal Deposits. &quot;This is just another way that TD Bank is helping to make investing
easier.&quot;

<P>Some of the benefits of TD GIC PLUS include:
<p><ul><li><b>Safety of Principal </b>- principal is protected regardless of the
performance of the stock market; issued by TD Mortgage Corporation, TD GIC PLUS is
guaranteed by TD Bank;</li>

<P><li><b>Minimum guaranteed return and potential for growth</b> - investors are
guaranteed a minimum rate of interest and receive the greater of the guaranteed interest or
participation in the growth of the TSE 100 Index;</li>

<P><li><b>Broad exposure to the stock market</b> - the longer term nature of the
investment allows customers to participate in stock market growth while avoiding short term
ups and downs.</li></ul>

<p>Customers can purchase TD GIC PLUS anytime of the year at any TD Bank branch. 
The minimum amount required is $500 for registered investments and $1,000 for non-registered
investments.  

<P>Other investment products currently being offered include, the Triple Value GIC, which
provides an escalating rate over 3 years, extendable both the second and third year, with a
minimum investment of $500; and The Pre-Encashable with a 1 year term, redeemable after
30 days with a minimum investment of $500.

<h3>Release Publication<br>Tuesday, October 1, 1996</h3>
<h2>News Release - Communique</h2>

<h3>TD INVESTS IN EMPLOYEE EDUCATION, SETTING THE PACE ACROSS THE
INVESTMENT INDUSTRY WITH THE THIRD ANNUAL &quot;NATIONAL
REVIEW&quot;</h3>

<P><b>TORONTO</b> - The third annual cross-Canada mutual fund education initiative
of TD Asset Management Inc. (TDAM), The National Review, will be administered
nationwide on Thursday, October 3, 1996.  The National Review is a key element of TD's
ongoing effort to provide the best possible investment counsel to its clients.  TD's rapid
growth and number one ranking in a recent mutual funds research survey conducted on behalf
of major Canadian financial institutions is testament to its superior service and excellence in
employee education.

<p>The National Review is a customized education and review program designed to test the
knowledge and service skills of TD's 5,300 investment specialists.  An overall total of 7,200
staff from front line investment specialists right through to senior management including 
TD Bank President A. Charles Baillie, Jr. will write The Review.

<p>&quot;Today's business environment is fraught with rapid change, a growing array of
investment products and the increasing demands of customers,&quot; says J. Mark Wettlaufer,
President of TDAM. &quot;TD's investment specialists recognize the need for lifelong
learning in order to stay ahead and remain leaders in an ever-changing industry.&quot;

<P>Wettlaufer continues, &quot;We believe we are unique in North America with this form
of training and quality assurance.  Ultimately, this process enables us to guarantee our
investment specialists from Kelowna to St. John's are providing superior and consistent service
to our customers.&quot;
                                
<P>Developed and graded by professors at the Faculty of Management of the University of
Toronto and the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education (OISE), and monitored by
independent proctors, The National Review is an exam that has become an annual measure of
employee expertise and a model for industry training standards both in Canada and the US.

<P>Each year materials are added to the program to ensure that TD staff remain leaders in
customer service.  The program now covers five key areas:  Market Knowledge; Product
Knowledge; Compliance; Sales Practices; and most recently developed, Financial Planning.

<p>&quot;Each year we strive to create a stronger impact on the education of TD's
investment specialists,&quot; says Professor Eric Kirzner, Faculty of Management, University
of Toronto. &quot;I feel that given the knowledge gained through previous National Reviews
and the in-depth preparation courses scheduled nationwide in advance of the examination, TD
personnel are well prepared not only to achieve high scores on the exam, but more
importantly, to provide improved client service again this year.&quot;

<P>TD Asset Management Inc. (TDAM) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Toronto-Dominion Bank.  TDAM currently manages in excess of $15 billion for mutual funds, pension
funds, corporations, institutions, endowments, foundations and high net worth individuals.

<h2>News Release - Communique</h2>

<h3>TD BANK AND SASKATCHEWAN INDIAN EQUITY FOUNDATION 
ANNOUNCE PLANS TO FORM CANADA'S FIRST ABORIGINAL PEOPLES
BANK</h3>

<P><b>TORONTO</b> - Plans for formation of Canada's newest chartered bank were
unveiled today by The Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD Bank), the Federation of Saskatchewan
Indians, Inc. and the Saskatchewan Indian Equity Foundation Inc. (SIEF).  Subject to
regulatory approval, the First Nations Bank of Canada is scheduled to begin operating in late
1996 with the head office in Saskatoon.

<p>First Nations Bank of Canada, a proposed Schedule II bank, will serve Aboriginal and
non-aboriginal people throughout Canada and will be the first Canadian bank with First
Nations involvement.

<p>Blaine Favel, Chief of the Federation of Saskatchewan Indian Nations, which owns
SIEF, calls this announcement a first step towards First Nations people achieving their goal of
economic self-sufficiency. &quot;First Nations people in Saskatchewan want to play a greater
role in the national economy.  We have been lending to First Nations businesses for 15 years
in Saskatchewan.  Forming a federally-chartered bank will make it possible to expand across
the country.&quot;

<P>&quot;Becoming economically self-sufficient is critical to political self-determination.  I
believe we have taken a major step forward today.  This will help create jobs and wealth for
our people and the economy as a whole,&quot; Favel added.
                                
<P>TD Bank is investing eight million dollars in start-up capital in the new bank with SIEF
contributing an additional two million dollars.  SIEF will receive three-quarters of the
operating profit from the new bank.  SIEF's profits will be reinvested and it is expected that
within ten years the bank will be fully Aboriginally owned and controlled.  Further,
Aboriginal individuals as well as First Nations will be able to purchase shares in First Nations
Bank of Canada.

<P>The proposed bank intends to apply to the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation for
membership.

<P>&quot;TD has always had a strong commitment to serving Canadian
communities,&quot; says A. Charles Baillie, President of TD Bank. &quot;We are pleased to
be part of this important development for Canada's Aboriginal communities.  Nothing could
better illustrate our commitment to bringing customers, 'Your Bank. Your Way'.&quot;

<P>TD and SIEF also announced the appointment of Barry Menary as President-Elect of the
First Nations Bank of Canada.  Menary has worked in Aboriginal banking and investment for
eleven years, the last four serving as Manager of Aboriginal Financial Services for TD Bank. 
This is a tremendous opportunity for Canadian Aboriginal peoples.  As the bank
expands it will introduce new jobs and career opportunities for people who want to serve their
communities through banking,&quot; Menary stated.

<p>Roy Bird, chair of Saskatchewan Indian Equity Foundation, stated that Saskatchewan's
First Nations citizens envisioned formation of a bank when SIEF was first created in the early
1980s. &quot;It took a long time but our objective is now in sight,&quot; Bird added.
&quot;When we teamed up with TD Bank we were able to move forward because it meant we
had access to management experience.&quot;
                                
<p>SIEF was Canada's first Aboriginal Capital Corporation (ACC).  In the past 15 years,
SIEF has loaned more than $30 million to Saskatchewan-based First Nations business
enterprises with a loan loss rate of just over one per cent.  However, as an ACC, SIEF is
restricted to term lending to businesses.  Forming a bank opens the complete array of banking
services including Visa cards, chequing, savings and other deposit accounts as well as the full
range of lending options such as lines of credit.  Through its relationship with TD, customers
of First Nations Bank of Canada will be able to access their accounts at any TD branch in the
nation.

<P>TD Bank is Canada's 5th largest bank with assets of more than $119 billion and equity
of $6.3 billion.  Rated Aa2 and AA by Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's
Ratings Group respectively, TD Bank has the highest securities rating of any Canadian bank. 
TD Bank has 949 branches across the country.

<P>The Federation of Saskatchewan Indian Nations is one of the largest organizations of its
type in Canada, representing 73 First Nations in Saskatchewan.  The Federation has a
philosophy of building sustainable institutions, and was instrumental in the founding of
Canada's only First Nations controlled university, the Saskatchewan Indian Federated College
in Regina.

<h3>Release Publication<br>Wednesday, September 11, 1996</h3>
<h2>News Release - Communique</h2>

<h3>TD BANK'S NEWEST STATE-OF-THE ART CALL CENTRE 
READY TO ANSWER CANADIANS' CALLS AROUND THE CLOCK</h3>

<P><b>TORONTO</b> - Today Toronto Dominion Bank President Charles Baillie officially
opened the Bank's newest and most technologically advanced Telephone Banking Call Centre, in
Markham, Ontario.  The new Call Centre's highly trained staff of 120 multilingual professionals
will facilitate a full range of fast, hassle-free banking services to TD Bank customers across
Canada, 24 hours a day, every day.

<p>TD's telephone banking is part of the TD Access family of new and easy-to-use high tech
services which enable Canadians to bank from the comfort of their home or office.  That is why
wickets are a thing of the past at the ergonomically designed, 18,000 square foot facility which is
located on the outskirts of Toronto, at 3500 Steeles Ave. E.

<h3>One Stop Banking by Phone</h3>
&quot;Our new TD Access Telephone Banking service will help you do almost everything you
can now do at a local bank branch with one simple phone call&quot;, says Mr. Baillie, who
joined Markham Mayor Don Cousens at a special opening ceremony for the Call Centre.  Full
service banking by telephone will start rolling out nationally on September 30.

<p>&quot;The telephone's emergence and rising popularity as a primary banking tool is a
progressive result of the move towards greater convenience and increasing automation in every
facet of our lives,&quot; says Mr. Baillie. &quot;Our staff and customers are pleased and proud
that TD Bank is the leader in introducing new, time saving, cost-cutting banking
innovations.&quot;
                                                       
<P>TD's self-service telephone banking offers cost savings of up to 50 per cent over traditional
in-branch banking.  There is no charge to pay a bill by telephone if you have a monthly service
plan account with TD Bank.

<p>&quot;Our customers have expressed their need for easy-to-use telephone banking
services,&quot; says Frank Van Nie, Director of Telephone Banking, a 17-year TD professional.
&quot;We are answering their call with an expert team of Banking Agents who can now help
them arrange mortgages and loans, contribute to RRSPs, buy GICs, open an account, answer
their financial questions, in addition to paying bills, transferring funds, and checking their
account balance.  Service is available in English, French, Cantonese and Mandarin.&quot;

<p>TD Bank customers who participated in the Call Centre's Kitchener-Waterloo pilot program
greatly enjoyed the convenience of being able to ask for financial advice and even negotiate a
loan or mortgage by talking to a knowledgeable banking agent by telephone.  &quot;Customers
are able to get the same high level of friendly and professional service they normally get from
their Loans Officer and Bank Manager at their local branch,&quot; says Mr. Van Nie.

<p>Other customers appreciated the Call Centre's speedy response. &quot;Our state-of-the-art
technology allows us to instantly call up information and answer questions, normally within 20
seconds,&quot; says Mr. Van Nie.

<P>TD Access Telephone Banking can be reached at one, easy to remember number - 
1-800-9TD-BANK.  It is also the new number for TD Bank's general information service and its
automated touch tone telephone service that has been in operation since 1991.

<h3>Nearly 2 Million Calls in One Month -- and Growing</h3>
&quot;We performed almost 2 million successful transactions last month,&quot; says Mr. Van
Nie. &quot;That is double the number made at the same time, last year.  We expect our business
to triple when we have completed our national roll-out of full service telephone banking, by the
end of 1998.&quot;
                                                  
<P>The new TD Access Telephone Banking Call Centre was built for growth, with room to
triple its roster of Banking Agents. &quot;We expect our staff to grow by at least 50 per cent
next year,&quot; says Mr. Van Nie.

<P>Each Telephone Banking Agent receives up to 225 hours of specialized training to learn the
expertise required to satisfy most banking needs.  In addition, most have previous branch
banking experience.

<h3>Banking Your Way</h3>
Under the TD Access umbrella, in the near future TD Bank will offer Canada's first fully
integrated personal computer banking and brokerage delivery channel, offering personal and
commercial banking and Green Line discount brokerage services all in one Windows-based
package.  In the spirit of true integration, the Telephone Banking Call Centre will operate the 
TD Access PC Banking Help Desk.

<p>&quot;Telephone Banking is a convenient complement to TD Bank's full range of banking
services including personal in branch banking, self serve Green Machine transactions and soon 
TD Access PC banking and investing services,&quot; says Mr. Van Nie. &quot;We will
continue to keep in close contact with our customers to meet their constantly evolving needs in
keeping with our promise to be  Your Bank. Your Way.'&quot;

<h2>News Release - Communique</h2>



<h3>TD BANK FIRST TO LAUNCH CANADA MORTGAGE AND HOUSING
CORPORATION'S NEW AUTOMATED MORTGAGE INSURANCE APPROVAL
SYSTEM</h3>

<P><b>TORONTO</b> - Toronto Dominion Bank is pleased to announce that it is the first
financial institution to offer its customers &quot;emili&quot;,  a new electronic system
developed by Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) to speed up the approval
process for CMHC mortgage loan insurance applicants.

<P>&quot;We are very pleased to be the first to offer the emili system and share in the launch of
this new technology with CMHC,&quot; said Bruce Shirreff, Senior Vice President, Mortgages.
&quot;With emili the turnaround time is greatly reduced, which means increased customer
service while streamlining current systems and eliminating much of the paperwork.  This is just
another way that TD is helping to make banking easier.&quot;

<P>Developed by CMHC, emili allows information to be input directly into the current system
used at the Bank.  The application is then assessed via a computer network linked to CMHC, and
provides a response almost instantly.  Previously, applications were sent via fax to CMHC,
reviewed and a response was then faxed back to the Bank.  

<P>Approximately 165 TD branches are already linked to emili with plans for a roll-out to all
branches by year end.

<h3>TORONTO DOMINION BANK LISTS ON NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE</h3>

<P>A. Charles Baillie, President of the Bank, traded the first TD shares in a ceremony on the
floor of the exchange at this morning's opening. &quot;Listing on the New York Stock Exchange
will provide important liquidity and presence for the new shareholders we will gain on
completion of the acquisition of Waterhouse Investor Services, Inc.,&quot; said Mr. Baillie.
&quot;In addition, listing will encourage purchase of TD stock by the broader U.S. investing
public.  Finally, the listing reinforces our strong commitment to our many lines of business in the
U.S.&quot;

<h3>Release Publication<br>Thursday, August 29, 1996</h3>
<h2>News Release - Communique</h2>

<h3>TORONTO DOMINION REPORTS THIRD QUARTER EARNINGS OF $223 MILLION
</h3>

<p><b>TORONTO </b> - Toronto Dominion Bank achieved another strong quarterly
performance with
net income of $223 million for the third quarter of 1996.  This is an increase of $3 million from
the
preceding quarter and a decrease of $2 million from last year.   Return on equity was 14.8%
compared to
16% in 1995.  For the nine months ended July 31, 1996, TD Bank earned net income of $665
million, a
$97 million or 17% increase from $568 million in the same period last year.

<P>The results of the quarter reflect the trends we have noted in our major markets and our
growth
strategies. &quot;Traditional banking businesses have been constrained by an economic
environment
characterized by slow growth, low inflation and the impact of changing demographics -- with the
population shifting its focus from borrowing to investing,&quot; said TD's Chairman and Chief
Executive
Officer, Richard M. Thomson. &quot;These trends -- combined with lower margins due to the
recent
decline in interest rates -- dampened net interest income.  At the same time, we continued to see
strong
gains in other income during the quarter -- reflecting growth in areas that we have targeted for
increased
investment,&quot; added Thomson.  

<P>These areas include discount brokerage, investment banking, mutual funds, investment
management,
computer and telephone banking, and card services.  We saw strong year-over-year growth in all
these
areas in the quarter.  

<P>&quot;Notably, our mutual funds exceeded the $8 billion mark -- exhibiting superior growth
in the
Canadian market; we boosted our investment management business and became Canada's largest
index and
quantitative investment manager with the acquisition of the Quantitative Capital Division of AMI
Partners
Inc,&quot; said Charles Baillie, President of TD. &quot;Green Line Investor Services, our
discount broker,
opened an office in Hong Kong and showed year-over-year revenue growth of over 30%,&quot;
added
Baillie. 

<p>Waterhouse Investor Services, Inc., the U.S. based discount brokerage we are in the process
of
acquiring, has also demonstrated outstanding growth.  We expect to close the Waterhouse
transaction once
final regulatory approvals have been received.  Our listing on the New York Stock Exchange will
proceed
tomorrow,  August 30.

<P>While building new businesses and focusing on growth areas where we believe TD can
generate
superior returns, we took three major steps to enhance shareholder value during the quarter:

<ul><P>
<li>We announced the largest share buyback in Canadian banking history, calling for the
repurchase of up
to 30 million common shares -- representing about 10% of TD's outstanding common shares. 
This move
was designed to improve share value by returning excess capital to shareholders.   Despite this
buyback, 
TD will continue to be one of the most highly capitalized banks in Canada and in a strong
position to
pursue attractive growth opportunities.

<P><li>Our strategy of focusing on growth areas goes hand in hand with the divestiture of
businesses
with limited potential for TD.  To this end, we announced an agreement to sell our institutional
and
pension custody business to Royal Trust.  TD had lacked the volumes and economies of scale
necessary for
long term superior returns.

<P><li>In our quest to be a low cost producer and improve productivity, we have entered into an 
  agreement with two other banks to &quot;co-source&quot; document processing services.  We
are jointly
developing a new company to handle these activities for all three institutions -- improving
economies of
scale and reducing processing costs.  The new operation will be phased in over the next three
years,
resulting in annual expenditure savings of at least 15 per cent.</ul>

<p>During the quarter, in pursuit of our core strategy of making it easier for our customers, we
launched
some important initiatives:
     
<P><ul><li>We unveiled TD Access -- North America's first fully integrated personal computer
banking
and brokerage delivery channel, offering personal and commercial banking and discount
brokerage
services all in one Windows-based package. We will be rolling out TD Access, which is now
being test-piloted, nationally this Fall.

<P><li>In our efforts to bring new dimensions to payment services, we announced a new pilot
project with
another bank to test EXACT, a computer chip based &quot;smart&quot; card for small
purchases.  The
one-year pilot project will be conducted in Kingston, Ontario, beginning this Fall.

<P><li>We formally launched TD Life Insurance Company, a wholly owned subsidiary, with the 
   announcement of an accidental death plan and an innovative health service called TD LifeLine
which
provides toll-free hotline telephone access to a wide variety of health and lifestyle information. 
A full
range of life and health insurance products will be introduced over the next few months.</ul>

<p>Currently, TD Life products are being marketed through direct mail to all TD customers.
Ultimately,
we are hopeful that the federal government will approve legislation that will enable banks in
Canada to use
our retail branches in the marketing of insurance products.  We believe such a move would
benefit
consumers while bringing Canada into line with financial services legislation in other major
markets
around the world.  We are encouraged by the government's decision to appoint a task force to
study the
future of the financial services sector and we are hopeful that the task force will recommend
progressive
action in the retailing of insurance.

<P>Lower interest rates are good for our customers and for the Canadian economy. Consumer
confidence
appears to be improving at last and that should fuel economic growth in the year ahead.  In this
environment, we believe TD will continue to generate strong returns and will continue on our
course to
build value.



<h2><center>Review of Operating Performance</center></h2>
TD Bank achieved another strong quarterly performance with net income of $223 million for the
third
quarter of 1996.  This is an increase of $3 million from the preceding quarter and a decrease of
$2 million
from last year.  While net income is similar to last year, the composition of revenue generated
has changed. 
Other income increased significantly year-over-year, reaching a level slightly less than the record
established last quarter, thereby increasing its contribution to total revenues from 32% a year ago
to 36%
this quarter.  In addition, net investment securities gains increased as equity markets were
stronger this year
than last year.  Partially offsetting these favourable developments was a decline in net interest
income due
to a decline in margins.

<P>During the quarter,  the Bank repurchased approximately 10 million of its common shares as
part of a
previously announced program which when completed at the end of fiscal 1997 will result in a
reduction in
outstanding shares of approximately 30 million or 10%.  As a result of fewer shares outstanding
and
continued strong earnings, net income per share reached a record level of $.73 in the third quarter
of 1996
compared to $.71 a year ago and $.70 for the preceding quarter.  On a fully diluted basis, net
income per
share was $.71 compared to $.70 last year and $.69 last quarter.

<p>Compared to last year, return on common equity and return on assets declined from 16.0% to
14.8%
and from 0.85% to 0.76% respectively, as this quarter's earnings were generated from higher
equity and
asset levels.

<P> For the nine months ending July 31, 1996, TD Bank earned net income of $665 million, a
$97
million or 17% increase from $568 million in the same period last year.  Year to date earnings
per share for
1996 were $2.14 versus $1.79 for the same period in 1995.

<h3>Net interest income</h3>
Net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis was $661 million, down $25 million from last
year.  This
decrease is due to a 40 basis points decline in margins to 2.49% which more than offset the 12%
increase
in average earning assets.  A combination of factors contributed to the margin decline.  First,
interest rates
have declined significantly compared to last year as indicated by the  
Bank's prime lending rate declining 200 basis points from  8.25% to 6.25%.  While good news
for our
customers, this has reduced the yield earned on investing our shareholder's equity and other
non-interest
bearing or low cost funds.  Second, net interest margin a year ago benefited from high interest
recoveries of
$46 million compared to only $5 million this quarter.  Third, although total average earning
assets
increased 12%, lending activity represented only 1 percentage point of this increase, whereas
securities and
trading related activities, which earn a lower interest margin than loans, represented 11
percentage points. 
Therefore, the impact of this asset growth on the Bank's net interest income was relatively small. 
Securities and trading related assets, as a proportion of the Bank's total average earnings assets,
increased
from 28% for the same quarter last year to 35% this quarter.  This significant change in asset mix
had an
unfavourable impact of approximately 29 of the 40 basis point decline in margin.

<P>Compared to last quarter, net interest income rose to $661 million from $630 million as a
result of
special dividends received from equity investments and a 5% increase in average earning assets. 
As asset
growth was primarily in very low margin securities purchased under resale agreements, margins
declined 7
basis points.

<P>The Bank continued to benefit from favourable equity market conditions and realized $29
million in
net investment securities gains.  This is the seventh consecutive quarter of security gains in
excess of $20
million.

<h3>Credit quality and provision for credit losses</h3>
Net impaired loans increased $44 million during the quarter to $439 million at July 31, 1996,
largely due
to business loans to borrowers in Canada.  However, net impaired loans as a percentage of total
loans and
bankers' acceptances at .5%  were unchanged from the previous quarter.

<p>The estimate of the provision for credit losses for 1996 remained unchanged from the last
quarter at
$170 million.  One quarter of the estimate, or $43 million, was charged against income in the
quarter.  This
was $3 million higher than the charge for the third quarter of 1995 which was favourably
impacted by the
$40 million reduction in the 1995 loss estimate to $200 million recorded that quarter.

<h3>Other income</h3>
Other income continued to be the primary reason for the Bank's strong financial performance as
it
increased $58 million or 17% from last year.  It is only down $6 million from last quarter's record
level.

<p>Greater activity by customers and expansion of operations led Green Line Investor Services,
our
discount broker, TD Evergreen Investment Services, our full service broker, and the Bank's
mutual funds
management operations to account for 50% of the $58 million increase in other income.   In
addition to
these operations,  growth in investment and securities services revenue was generated from
activities
related to mergers and acquisitions, underwriting and equity sales and trading. 

<P>Derivative products revenue experienced strong growth due to favourable market conditions.

<P>Card services revenue grew $4 million or 13%, as consumer activity increased.

<h3>Non-interest expenses</h3>
As the 10% growth over the same quarter a year ago in expenses exceeded the 4% growth in total
revenues, the Bank's productivity ratio deteriorated from 58.3% to 61.6%.  As with the preceding
quarter,
two-thirds of the expense increase related to continued expansion and activity in our securities
businesses
and to performance related compensation.  The remainder of the increase was largely due to the
write-off
in the quarter of $5 million of goodwill associated with the purchase of businesses from AMI
Partners Inc.,
further development of the Bank's computer and telephone banking systems, and higher
government
levies.

<h3>Balance Sheet</h3>
At July 31, 1996, total assets were $119 billion, an increase of $14 billion or 13% over a year
ago.  While
all asset categories increased, over 80% of the increase was due to greater trading activity
undertaken by
the Bank resulting in increases in securities, securities purchased under resale agreements, and
cash
resources.  Residential mortgages grew a strong 7%.
                                
<p>Personal non-term deposits were up 3% from a year ago.  Mutual funds managed by the Bank
continued to post strong growth as they totalled $8.4 billion at quarter-end compared to $5.7
billion last
year.

<p>As a result of a further decline in market interest rates and continued strong equities markets,
the
market value of the Bank's securities portfolios held for investment and liquidity purposes at July
31, 1996
was  $15 million above book value, compared to $40 million below book value at October 31,
1995.






<h3>Capital</h3>
Common equity declined $77 million during the quarter as earnings after dividends of $141
million and
unrealized foreign currency translation gains of $23 million were more than offset by the $244
million
reduction related to the share buy back program.  Compared to last quarter-end, risk-weighted
assets
increased $4.5 billion, primarily due to increased corporate lending and syndication activity. 
With these
changes, the ratio of net common equity to risk-weighted assets declined to 6.6% from 7.0% at
the
previous quarter-end and 6.7% a year ago.


<h3>Waterhouse Investor Services, Inc.</h3>
The Bank's acquisition of Waterhouse is expected to close once final regulatory approvals have
been
received.  On August 20, Waterhouse shareholders approved the transaction, which will cost
US$535
million in cash and TD common shares.

<h3>Release Publication<br>Monday, August 26, 1996</h3>
<h2>News Release - Communique</h2>

<h3>TD ECONOMISTS SAY PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE MADE GREAT
PROGRESS FIGHTING DEFICITS</h3>

<P><b>TORONTO</b> -  The federal and provincial governments will likely meet or better
their fiscal targets this year, according to a report released today by TD economists.  The annual
TD publication, <i>TD Report on Provincial Government Finances,</i> says that Canada's
federal and provincial governments have made great progress towards balancing budgets in
recent years.  

<P>&quot;Seven provincial governments  -- all with the exception of Ontario, Quebec and
Newfoundland -- plan to balance their budgets this year.  This is up from a total of six last year
and zero as recently as fiscal 1993-94,&quot; says Teresa Chandler, TD Senior Economist.
Canada's provincial governments have made commitments to trim their combined deficit from
1.3 per cent of GDP this year to almost zero three years from now.
 
<P>Expenditure restraint remained a prominent theme in the 1996 budgets, as provincial finance
ministers had to cope with declines in federal-provincial transfers this year and next.  In terms of
tax measures, Ontario led other provinces in cutting taxes, delivering a 30-per-cent cut in
personal income tax rates to be implemented over three years. 
                                
<P>The combined federal and provincial government debt-to-GDP ratio, which has increased
from 87 per cent of GDP five years ago to an estimated 108 per cent this year, is expected to
decline starting in fiscal 1997-98.

<P>TD economists have ranked the provinces based on their progress in achieving a stable
balanced-budget position. &quot;In terms of successfully balancing their budgets and taking
steps toward debt reduction, the top performing provincial governments are Alberta,
Saskatchewan, Manitoba, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island,&quot; says Ms. Chandler.

<P>A second group includes two provinces -- British Columbia and Nova Scotia -- which plan to
move into a balanced-budget position this year.

<P>The third group of provinces -- Ontario, Quebec and Newfoundland -- will not achieve
balanced budgets this year or next.

<p>&quot;Although deficit reduction has been and will continue to be difficult, the rewards for
reducing government deficits and debt have already become apparent,&quot; says Ms. Chandler. 
Over the course of the past year, financial markets have regained confidence in the ability of
Canadian governments to achieve their fiscal targets, so that the risk premium incorporated in
Canadian interest rates has narrowed sharply.

<P>It is important, note TD economists, that Canadian governments continue to work towards
improving their fiscal positions, and shift their focus to reducing outstanding debt over the
medium term. &quot;Once debt levels have been reduced, and debt-service burdens begin to fall,
governments will be able to afford to offer Canadians a combination of more spending in priority
areas and lower taxes for consumers and businesses,&quot; says Teresa Chandler.

<h2>News Release - Communique</h2>

<h3>TORONTO DOMINION BANK DECREASES INTEREST RATE ON ITS
EMERALD VISA CARD </h3>

<P><b>TORONTO</b> - TD Bank announced today that it will lower the interest rate by more
than one per cent on the TD EMERALD Visa Card, to 10.75 per cent effective September 1.  
TD Visa is committed to offering the lowest Visa rate in Canada on TD EMERALD, which was
launched last year to give customers a low-rate Visa alternative.

<P>&quot;Our low rate TD EMERALD Visa Card is a sensible alternative for customers who
carry balances and want to save on interest charges.  We are pleased to be able to take advantage
of the continuing decline in both the bank and prime rates and pass on the savings to our
customers,&quot; says Barb Cromb, Associate Vice President, TD Visa. &quot;Interest rates on
our other cards are currently under review, but we felt it important to move quickly with our most
interest-sensitive product.&quot;

<p>Other TD Visa products include the TD Gold Travel Card, The GM Visa Card, TD Gold
Elite, TD GREEN Classic Card, TD Purchase Manager and the U.S. Dollar Advantage Card.

<h3>Release Publication<br>Tuesday, August 20, 1996</h3>
<h2>News Release - Communique</h2>

<h3>THE BLOCK PARENT PROGRAM OF CANADA AND TD BANK LAUNCH YEAR
II OF SPONSORSHIP PROGRAM</h3>

<P><b>TORONTO</b> - Block Parent Program of Canada Inc. and Toronto Dominion Bank, its
national sponsor, today announced the launch of the Block Parent sponsorship program for 1996. 

<p>This year's program kicks-off with national media support consisting of transit shelter
posters which focus on the benefits of becoming a Block Parent.  The posters will direct people
to their local TD Branch for applications and information about the program and how to become
a Block Parent.

<p>&quot;Over the past year our partnership with TD Bank has allowed the Block Parent
Program of Canada to reach many of its goals,&quot; says Rose Marie Danylo Brien, President
of Block Parents.  &quot;Block Parent volunteers and TD branch representatives have helped
raise public awareness of the program and expand our network of homes that children can turn to
in time of distress.&quot;

<P>&quot;Children's safety is an ongoing concern for TD Bank and we are excited to be moving
into year two of our partnership with Block Parent,&quot; says Suzanne Crocker, Group
Manager, Financial Services, TD Bank. &quot;As the national sponsor of Block Parent we will
continue to spread their message through our branch network in an effort to create safer
neighbourhoods.&quot;
                                
<P>TD Bank has 949 branches located in almost every community across Canada.
                                
<P>For over 25 years, the Block Parent Program has been helping to make communities safer by
encouraging co-operation among citizens, law enforcement agencies, school boards, all levels of
governments and supportive businesses and service clubs.  Throughout Canada, the red and white
Block Parent sign is a symbol of a safe refuge where assistance is available.  Currently, there are
approximately 1,200 Block Parent communities and approximately 350,000 Block Parent homes
across the country.

<h3>Release Publication<br>Wednesday, August 14, 1996</h3>
<h2>News Release - Communique</h2>

<h3>GREEN LINE INVESTOR SERVICES FIRST IN CANADA TO LAUNCH
TRADING ON THE INTERNET: "WEBBROKER" MOST SECURE SYSTEM IN
NORTH AMERICA</h3>

<P><b>TORONTO</b> - Green Line Investor Services, Canada's largest discount broker, today
became the country's <i>first</i> broker to offer securities trading on the Internet with
WebBroker - the most secure trading technology now available in North America.  WebBroker
allows the self-directed investor to buy and sell North American equities and options through the
Internet.  Launched in a pilot phase this week, WebBroker will go national this fall.

<p>&quot;Technology is revolutionizing money management for the individual investor,&quot;
says John See, President and Chief Operating Officer of Green Line Investor Services.
&quot;Trading on the Internet further empowers individuals to take control of their investment
decisions any time, anywhere.  It's convenient, private, low cost, self-directed trading at your
fingertips.  Our clients will now be able to manage most aspects of their portfolio through the
Internet.&quot;

<P>Green Line has been the technological market leader since 1992, when it first introduced
electronic trading to Canadians.  Trading on the Internet clearly establishes Green Line at the
forefront of innovation, using the advanced technology to deliver low cost, high quality
brokerage services to retail investors in Canada and abroad.

<P>While Green Line's commission rates are already discounted as much as 88 per cent
compared to full commission brokers' charges, trading electronically with Green Line provides
retail investors with additional opportunities for brokerage commission savings.
                                
<P><b>Surf and Trade on the 'Net</b><br>
Thirty per cent of Green Line's current trading activity is already initiated electronically by its
customers with Green Line's state-of-the-art, proprietary computer technology MicroMax, or by
telephone with TeleMax.  Mr. See anticipates that as much as 15 per cent of Green Line's
530,000 customers will sign on to Internet trading.

<P>&quot;Computer and Internet stock trading is already very much in demand by Canadian
investors,&quot; says Mr. See, who adds that key to the growth and acceptance of computer
initiated transactions is the ability to integrate multiple distribution channels, new and existing,
with every client's account. &quot;Retail investors want choice and flexibility from a service that
provides real value.&quot;

<P>Virtually anything you can do with a Green Line registered representative over the phone,
you can now do yourself with WebBroker.  Only one password is required for quick, easy access
into the system.  When available nationally, WebBroker will be accessed by logging onto Green
Line's new and improved Web site: www.greenline.ca.

<P>&quot;Many Green Line customers spend up to 20 hours a week researching company
information and market reports on the Internet before they make an investment decision,&quot;
says Mr. See. &quot;The option to trade on the  Net will make investing even easier, faster, and
more convenient.&quot;

<p>WebBroker permits orders to be placed instantly on-line, any time; provides access to
account information, portfolio review and transaction history; and gives real-time quotes for all
major North American equities or options.  Mutual fund trading and quotes will be available on
WebBroker by the end of this year.
                                
<p><b>Security is a Priority</b><br>
&quot;WebBroker uses Netscape 2.02 Internet browser technology with 128 bit key encryption,
the most secure browser on the market for Internet access, available only to Canadian and U.S.
citizens,&quot; says David Sypher, Manager, Electronic Delivery Systems at Green Line. 
&quot;Green Line was not prepared to compromise client account security,&quot; he added.

<p>Green Line has taken further steps to make WebBroker even more secure with a super 
&quot;firewall&quot; that protects the main information storage system at TD Bank and Green
Line.

<p><b>Full Range of Technological Trading</b><br>
Green Line now offers one of the most complete and comprehensive suite of on-line trading tools
available in North America, 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  In addition to WebBroker
Internet trading, Canada's discount broker provides PC electronic trading for DOS, Macintosh
and Windows software platforms with its MicroMax and TD Access 
PC Broker services.

<p>TD Access PC Broker is the Windows-based Green Line service within the integrated
financial services product that also includes personal and business banking services, the only
service of its kind in North America.  Currently, TD Access PC Broker has the same features as
WebBroker plus access to order over 500 mutual funds.  

<P>Green Line, a division of TD Securities Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of TD Bank, was
founded in 1984.  It now serves more than half a million Canadians and services close to 
80 per cent of the nation's discount market, with more than $15.5 billion in assets.

<h3>Release Publication<br>Thursday, July 25, 1996</h3>



<h2>News Release - Communique</h2>



<h3>Royal Trust Acquires Institutional and Pension Custodial Business of TD Bank</h3>

<P><b>TORONTO, July 25, 1996</b> -Royal Trust announced today that it has reached
agreement to acquire the Institutional Custody and Pension Custody business of TD Bank. 
Under the terms of the agreement, Royal Trust will acquire approximately $CDN 47 billion of
client assets under administration.  The sale does not include the record keeping services or the
custody of TD's Green Line Mutual Funds, or TD Bank's own pension plan.

<p>"From a longer term strategic perspective, we did not feel we could grow our market share
enough to justify the substantial ongoing technological investment in this very competitive,
finely priced business," said Charles Macfarlane, Senior Vice President, TD Bank.  "This move
allows us to focus on where we can grow and add value for our customers and shareholders.  It
also reflects the worldwide consolidation in this segment of the custody business.  While we
have been able to offer our clients excellent service, we feel that we have a responsibility to look
to their future needs and make the choices that will serve them best.  Royal Trust is well
positioned to do so."

<p>"This further enhances our position as the leading provider of custodial services in Canada,"
said David Dunlop, Senior Vice President, Global Securities Services, Royal Trust.  "TD has an
excellent roster of custody accounts and we are delighted to have this opportunity to establish
new relationships with those clients.  Royal Trust has the resources, the technology and client
focus to ensure they continue to receive high quality service."

<p>The deal is expected to close on August 23, 1996 subject to regulatory approvals.

<p>Royal Trust is one of Canada's leading trust companies with client assets under
administration of $400 billion.  It provides wealth management services to personal and
institutional clients through a network of offices in Canada and through 27 offices in 21 countries
around the world. The company provides custodial services in 65 international centres.  Royal
Trust is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Royal Bank of Canada and is a member of the Royal
Bank Financial Group, one of North America's leading providers of quality financial services to
approximately 10 million personal and business clients.

<p>The Toronto Dominion Bank (TD Bank) is Canada's fifth largest chartered with total assets
of $115 billion as at April 30, 1996.  With over 30,000 employees worldwide, it provides a range
of financial services to personal and corporate clients through offices in Canada and
internationally.</p>

<h3>Release Publication<br>Tuesday, July 16, 1996 </h3>

<h2>News Release - Communique</h2>

<h3>TD BANK INTRODUCES ITS ELECTRONIC COMMERCE PROGRAM
VIA THE WORLD WIDE WEB</h3>

<P>TORONTO - Committed to offering its customers the best in technology based solutions, 
TD Bank today announced the introduction of its electronic commerce program for on-line
merchants supporting secure credit card transactions via the World Wide Web.  TD will utilize
Open Market, Inc. technology and services to support a pilot which begins in mid-July.  TD
merchants participating in the electronic commerce pilot include Statistics Canada, Nuvo
Network Management, and ICE Integrated Communications & Entertainment Inc.    

<p>The Bank will use Open Market's OM Transact <font size=-2><b>(TM)</b></font>
transaction
management software to support
the pilot program.  The electronic commerce program will offer merchants &quot;back
office&quot; customer support and transaction management services, while allowing retail
customers to transmit their credit card number directly and securely to TD Bank for processing. 

<p>&quot;There are two things involved in Internet commerce: the participating business'
commercial presence; and the processing of the transactions that take place via the
Internet,&quot; says Kevin Dwyer, General Manager of Open Market in Canada. &quot;It is
important that the two remain separate in order to provide a high level of security to the
consumer.&quot; 

<p>It is estimated that as many as one in ten Internet users have made a purchase using the
Internet. &quot;The indications are that the public is open to the concept and willing to try
Internet shopping.  For Statistics Canada, being able to offer consumers our products through
alternative delivery channels is an opportunity to expand our service options,&quot; says
Michael Thoen, Internet Application Development Manager, Statistics Canada. 

<p>&quot;The ability to make purchases over the Internet anytime, anyplace, offers consumers
flexibility, and merchants the opportunity to market their products on-line in a secure
manner,&quot; says Shirley Poon, New Product Development Manager, TD Card and Direct
Services. &quot;As a leading provider of innovative financial services, TD's electronic
commerce will give us the opportunity to broaden our range of services, in keeping with our
commitment to help make it easier.&quot;

<p>TD Bank's World Wide Web site has won various awards and was recognized by Interactive
Age magazine as one of the top 100 Business Web sites.  TD's Web site features over 4,000
pages of information available in English, French and Chinese.  The site welcomes  about 65,000
visitors and up to 1,000,000 hits on a monthly basis.

<h3>Release Publication<br>Monday, July 15, 1996</h3>
<h2>News Release - Communique</h2>

<h3>TD ECONOMISTS SEE PROMISING SIGNS FOR CANADIAN ECONOMY</h3>

<P>TORONTO - &quot;Although there is considerable slack in the Canadian economy, we
expect economic growth and job creation to strengthen over the remainder of this year,&quot;
says Ruth Getter, Senior Vice President and Chief Economist at TD Bank.   &quot;Interest rates
are low, consumers are beginning to feel more confident and exports remain strong.&quot;

<p>According to the <i><b>TD Quarterly Economic Report</b></i> released today, the Bank
expects the pace of economic growth in Canada to accelerate from 1.6 per cent this year to 2.4
per cent in 1997.  The new publication includes analysis and forecasts of the Canadian and U.S.
economies, and of Canadian industries and provincial economies.  This report also includes
highlights of TD's research on the automotive industry, commodity prices, and provincial
government finances.

<p>According to Dr. Getter, the remarkably rapid growth of the U.S. economy so far this year
has increased the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will raise short-term interest rates this
summer, but any rise will be relatively modest and short-lived.  TD economists predict that
economic growth in the U.S. will slow in the second half of this year and in 1997. 

<p>&quot;International financial markets have begun to show confidence in the ability of
Canadian governments to reduce their deficits and tackle their debt burdens,&quot; says Dr.
Getter.  The combination of improved fiscal performance, fewer concerns about Canada's
political situation, and consistently lower inflation in Canada than in the United States has
allowed Canadian short-term interest rates to fall below U.S. rates in recent months.  Dr. Getter
expects that the Bank of Canada will continue to keep interest rates low, &quot;as long as the
dollar remains stable.&quot;

<p>The <i><b>TD Quarterly Economic Report</b></i> says that Canada's manufacturing
sector, which slowed during the past year, is regaining strength and will outperform most other
sectors in 1997.  A continued rapid expansion in the machinery and equipment industries and
moderate growth in the automotive assembly and parts industries are expected in 1996-97.  The
forest products industry, however, will have to cope with low pulp and newsprint prices.  
Canada's service sector, which accounts for about two-thirds of economic output, will expand by
about 2 per cent per year in 1996-97, constrained by ongoing government spending cutbacks.

<p>TD economists note that Ontario moved into the top provincial growth spot last year for the
first time in this decade. &quot;<b>Ontario's</b> economy will remain the provincial growth
leader over the next few years, spurred by continued increases in exports and a strengthening of
consumer spending,&quot; says Dr. Getter. <b>Quebec's</b> economy will lag significantly
behind Ontario's this year, partly as a result of a weak performance by the province's forest
products and automotive manufacturing industries.

<p><i><b>Other Provincial Highlights included in the TD Quarterly Economic
Report:</b></i>
<ul>
     <p>The economies of  <b>British Columbia</b> and <b>Alberta,</b> which
     consistently recorded  above-average growth in the first half of the decade, will expand at
     close to the national pace this year and next.

     <p><b>B.C.'s</b> economic performance will be hampered by weakness in the forestry
     sector this year.  

     <p>The slowdown in oil and natural gas drilling will curtail <b>Alberta's</b> economic
     expansion in 1996-97.

     <p><b>Saskatchewan</b> farmers have shifted acreage to wheat and other cereals in
     response to very high wheat prices so far this year.

     <p><b>Manitoba</b> will post the second-fastest economic growth among the
     provinces in 1996, as its diversified manufacturing sector prospers.
                                
     <p><b>New Brunswick</b> will outperform the other Atlantic provinces this year, in
     spite of a slowdown in the important forestry sector.

     Economic conditions will improve in <b>Nova Scotia</b> in 1997, spurred by
     construction work on a major pulp and paper facility.
     
     <p><b>Prince Edward Island's</b> manufacturing sector will continue to expand, but
     the economy will weaken in 1997 when construction work on the fixed-link bridge winds
     down.  

     <p>Although <b>Newfoundland's</b> economy will contract this year as the
     construction phase of the Hibernia project ends, the outlook will brighten as oil
     production from Hibernia begins in late 1997.</ul>

<p>TD economists conclude that &quot;in an environment of low inflation, low interest rates,
and an improved fiscal position, the outlook for the Canadian economy is quite
favourable.&quot;

<h3>Release Publication<br>Thursday, July 4, 1996</h3>

<h2>News Release - Communique</h2>

<h3>Three Banks Opt for &quot;Made in Canada&quot; Response
To Global Competition</h3>


<P>TORONTO, July 4, 1996 - Three Canadian banks today announced that they have reached
agreement in principle to launch a new co-sourcing enterprise to handle high-volume document
processing for all three institutions.

<p>Bank of Montreal, Royal Bank of Canada and The Toronto-Dominion Bank will share
equally in the ownership and control of the stand-alone company, which will have its own
independent management.  The banks view this company as their &quot;made in Canada&quot;
response to the competition posed by several large service companies that are at the vanguard of
a world-wide trend toward out-sourcing of business such as document processing.

<p>The new company will be investing in the latest technologies, such as &quot;imaging,&quot;
to handle the processing of cheques and credit card sales drafts and payments.  Such new
technologies will allow the three banks to slow the growth of related expenses, and continue to
provide a high level of service to customers.

<p>The volume of paper transactions handled by banks has been dropping steadily since 1988,
while there have been significant pressures on the unit cost of processing these documents.  The
dwindling volumes had made it generally unattractive for any one bank to invest in new
processing technologies.  As a result, all three banks had been considering job reductions in the
area of document processing - indeed, each of the banks had looked at out-sourcing as an
alternative.

<p>Instead, by pooling their resources in a new co-sourcing company, the three banks will be
able to achieve the economies of scale to make the large investments required to compete
effectively - and preserve jobs.  When the new company is fully phased in three years from
now, it will employ more than 2,700 people, making it one of the largest companies of its kind in
North America.  



<P>While this is fewer people than are doing the work in the three banks today, the banks expect
to place the majority of affected employees.  This will be accomplished through redeployment to
the new company and, with retraining, to other areas in the banks, and through attrition. The
banks estimate that, in the worst-case scenario, about 500 people will not be placed over the
three-year period - although all three banks will attempt to find alternatives for all displaced
employees.

<p>The three banks plan to have a management team in place at the new company before the
autumn, and to begin phasing processing work into the new company early in the new year.  The
arrangement is subject to regulatory approval.

<h3>Release Publication<br>Wednesday, June 26, 1996</h3>
<h2>News Release - Communique</h2>

<h3>ELECTRONIC CASH CARD TO BE PILOTED BY BANK OF MONTREAL AND THE
TORONTO-DOMINION BANK IN KINGSTON </h3>

<p>TORONTO, June 25, 1996 - Bank of Montreal and The Toronto-Dominion Bank today
announced plans to test an electronic cash card in Kingston, Ontario. Starting early this fall,
Kingstonians will be able to pay for purchases with an electronic card on which cash value can
be loaded. The new card - called EXACT - will undergo a year-long test as a cash alternative.

 <p>&quot;The Exact card takes the hassle out of searching for exact change and complements
the debit and credit cards people already use for other purchases,&quot; said Steve Phillips,
Manager, Access Cards and Smart Card Development, TD Bank. &quot;The trial of our Exact
card in the Kingston area will tell us if Canadians agree.&quot;

<p>Bell Canada is a major supplier in a marketing partnership with Bank of Montreal and The
Toronto-Dominion Bank on the Kingston pilot.  Screen-based telephones and converted public
payphones are options being explored by Bell Canada to establish how best to use its extensive
telecommunications and computer infrastructure as part of the pilot.

<p>The banks are adapting the Proton technology that was developed in Belgium by Banksys,
Belgium's equivalent to Interac. &quot;During the past year, Bank of Montreal and TD Bank
have been looking into this new payment system, one which would be a convenient low-cost
alternative to paper and coin currency,&quot; said Mike Bradley, Senior Manager, Smart Card
Products, Bank of Montreal. &quot;We are launching a comprehensive trial of this tried and
proven technology because we believe Canadian consumers will find the product as convenient
as Europeans have.&quot;

<P>The card stores electronic cash on a computer chip embedded on the card. The card is like an
electronic wallet. Consumers will be able to load money from their bank accounts to the card at
bank counters and through special load devices located at branches and at other convenient
locations. As customers make purchases the amount of cash on the card reduces accordingly. 
Customers can then reload the Exact card whenever they want.

<P>The Exact card was demonstrated today in Toronto at Timothy's Coffees of the World.  The
coffee shop represents a typical location where the new smart card can act as an alternative for
cash. Other locations include retail outlets like fast food restaurants, video rental stores and gas
stations. 

<P>For consumers, the Exact card will mean having to carry fewer coins and bills, always having
the exact change and making their purchase of items fast and convenient. For merchants, the
Exact card will mean a reduction in cash handling costs, guaranteed payment and improved
customer service.

<P>Bryan Boyd, Bell Canada's Vice President-Finance & Insurance Solutions, said &quot;The
Exact card service is yet another example of using telecommunications and technology to make
life simpler and easier for Canadians. It also gives Bell the opportunity to work closely with our
corporate customers and help them supply the services they need for success and
convenience.&quot;

<p>The banks see a large market for the Exact card.  Research shows that, in Canada, 22 per cent
of all consumer expenditures are under $20. The banks estimate the retail market to be between
$40 and $60 billion annually in small bills and coins. Canadian consumers are already the
holders of an estimated 43 million debit and credit cards, with debit card usage growing by 43
per cent between 1995 and 1996. Canadians are the second largest users of plastic cards in the
world.

<p>The Greater Kingston Area was selected as the pilot location for its size, the presence of
three post-secondary campuses and a demographic profile that is well suited to test the Exact
card with Canadians. 

<P>A Kingston area advisory board will work with the two banks during the test of the Exact
card. Members include the Greater Kingston Chamber of Commerce, Kingston Area Economic
Development Commission (KAEDC), Kingston Public Utilities Commission, Royal Military
College, St. Lawrence College, Queen's University, Downtown Kingston Business Improvement
Area and Kingston area municipalities.

<p>&quot;Greater Kingston is pleased to have been selected for this exciting pilot project. Our
community enjoys an excellent reputation as a premier business and tourism destination and is
home to many new technologies,&quot; said David Cash, Executive Director, KAEDC.
&quot;We were Canada's first capital, and we are celebrating our 150th anniversary in 1996. The
Exact card is another first, and we are proud to be leading the way.&quot;

<p>The banks expect to install close to 800 merchant terminals in the Kingston area and 20,000
Exact card users will participate during the year-long pilot.  The technology will run on a server
platform provided by Tandem Computers.

<h3>Release Publication<br>Wednesday, June 26, 1996</h3>
<h2>News Release - Communique</h2>

<h3>TD BANK ANNOUNCES TD ACCESS - NORTH AMERICA'S FIRST FULLY 
INTEGRATED PERSONAL COMPUTER BANKING AND BROKERAGE SERVICE
</h3>

<P>TORONTO - The Toronto-Dominion Bank, a leader in bringing the best in new banking
technology to Canadians, today unveiled another industry breakthrough.  TD Access is 
North America's first ever, fully integrated personal computer banking and brokerage delivery
channel, offering personal, commercial and discount brokerage services all in one
Windows-based package.

<P>&quot;Today's the day computer banking comes of age,&quot; says TD Bank President
Charles Baillie, of the comprehensive new service that will be test piloted in Guelph, Ontario this
Summer, and launched nationally this Fall. &quot;TD Access will set the gold standard in its
field.&quot;

<p>&quot;TD Access gives customers 24-hour access to personal and business banking plus
access to TD's highly popular Green Line Investor Services, Canada's largest discount
brokerage,&quot; says Mr. Baillie. &quot;It will be the personal computer banking service of
choice because no other financial institution offers such a comprehensive service.&quot;

<h3>Personal, Commercial and Investment Services</h3>

&quot;TD's distinct advantage over its competitors is that it will be early to market with a fully
integrated product,&quot; says Jamie Keating, an analyst at Midland Walwyn who has seen a
preview of TD Access.

<p>&quot;Another advantage is that TD has many customers banking by phone plus the highest
proportion among competitors of customers trading on-line, with Green Line, who are ready to
convert to TD's new product,&quot; says Mr. Keating. &quot;There is good potential for
immediate customer sign-up.&quot;

<h3>Pricing and Distribution</h3>

&quot;Any personal banking customer with a TD Service Plan or who maintains a monthly
balance of at
least $1000 will pay <i>no monthly service charges</i> for using TD Access,&quot; says Ron
Hodges,
Vice President, Direct Services. &quot;That represents about 70 per cent of our personal banking
customers,&quot; he added.  Personal and business banking customers will be able to easily
obtain the
software to sign on to TD Access by calling a 1-800 number.

<P>Walt MacNee, Vice President, Cash Management Services, says &quot;By making banking
easier
and more versatile for our business banking clients, we're offering them an invaluable financial
management tool to save both time and money.  Small office/home office and business customers
with a
TD Business Service Plan will pay no additional monthly fee to access account information on
their desk
tops.&quot;

<p>Green Line customers can do the things they can now do with Green Line's Micromax
software, but
in a Windows environment and at no additional cost. &quot;Clients will be able to buy, sell or
obtain
real time quotes for North American equities and options, and over 500 different mutual funds,
plus
transfer funds electronically to their brokerage account from any TD bank account,&quot; says
John See,
President, Green Line Investor Services.  
                                                       <h3>Making Banking Easier</h3>

Steve Gesner, Associate Vice President, Alternate Delivery Channels at TD Bank, is one of the
architects behind TD Access. &quot;Our personal computer banking and brokerage service is 
entirely customer-driven,&quot; he says. &quot;In developing it, we wanted to offer the widest
range of 
features in an easy to use, secure way.&quot;  With TD Access, customers can quickly and easily
make bank transfers and pay bills; access their VISA accounts; conduct business banking; access
on-line
stock quotes in real time; make stock trades; and be able to call a 24-hour  Help Desk for support
or
information.

<P>&quot;Giving our customers control of when and how they bank is central to TD Bank's
philosophy
and commitment to service,&quot; says Mr. Gesner. &quot;TD Access is another demonstration
of our
promise to help make banking easier.&quot;

<h4>TD Access features include:</H4>
<ul>
<li>the highest level of communications security -- the same as that used in ABMs
<li>real time access to bank accounts, North American stocks, options and over 500 mutual
funds
<li>easy switching between brokerage, personal and business transactions
<li>a &quot;Favourite Transaction&quot; function for frequently used activities
<li>banking 24 hours a day, every day
<li>multiple account updates
<li>bill payment lists and a history of bill payments
<li>information transferable to many money management software packages such as Intuit's
&quot;Quicken&quot; or Microsoft's &quot;Money&quot;</ul>


                                                       <h3>Bringing Banking Into the Future</h3>

Experts predict that by the year 2000, more than 70 per cent of Canadian households will have
computers equipped to access one or more on-line services, nearly double what exists today.  
&quot;TD
Access will be one of those frequently used, on-line services.  Our service will evolve to meet
our
customers' changing needs, ensuring TD remains at the forefront of technological
innovation,&quot;
said Mr. Baillie. &quot;This is only the beginning.&quot; 

<P>TD Access will require a 386, 8MB RAM computer and modem.

<h2>News Release - Communique</h2>

<h3>TD BANK EXTENDS BENEFITS PACKAGE TO CASUAL PART-TIME
EMPLOYEES </h3>

<p>TORONTO - The Toronto-Dominion Bank announced today that it is extending employee
benefits to its casual part-time workers.  Previously employee benefits were made available only
to permanent part-time or full-time employees.  Now all TD employees who routinely work an
average of 15 hours per week will have access to a package which includes: 
group life insurance, short term disability insurance, long term disability insurance, as well as a
range of optional benefits.

<P>&quot;Changes in consumer demand have put an emphasis on flexible banking hours,&quot;
says  Gary Dobbie, Vice President, Compensation. &quot;Having qualified professionals
available to meet our customers' busy schedules through what can sometimes be irregular hours
is important.  We must make sure that employees who want to work on a flexible basis receive a
package of benefits which is as good as the package available for permanent part-time and 
full-time staff.&quot;

<P>The new eligibility policy will make it possible for approximately 1,500 of the Bank's casual
employees to have access to benefits.

<P>&quot;Many of our casual part-time employees appreciate the option of combining work and
personal priorities,&quot; says Dobbie. &quot;We wanted to offer these people a complete
compensation package including benefits that would enable us to retain valuable
personnel.&quot;

<P>As well as the new benefits which will automatically apply, casual employees will also now
be eligible for optional benefits such as health insurance, dental insurance, life insurance, a stock
accumulation plan, and employee loan benefits.
                                             <P>In addition, all TD employees, regardless of the number of hours
they work, are eligible for
TD Accident Insurance, TD Pension Plan, and Employee Banking and Product Discounts.

<h3> TD LIFE LAUNCHES WITH INNOVATIVE NEW HEALTH SERVICE</h3>

<p>TORONTO - Aiming to make a significant impact on the insurance marketplace, The
Toronto-Dominion Bank has launched its wholly-owned subsidiary TD Life Insurance Company
(TD Life) by introducing an innovative new health service. 

<P>Called TD LifeLine, the service offers customers toll-free telephone hotline access to a wide
variety of health and lifestyle information. Callers may choose to speak directly with a specially
trained health professional or to be connected to TD LifeLine's extensive audio library. The audio
library is available 24 hours a day and, to round out the service, customers may request follow-up
materials by fax or mail.

<p>&quot;Most life insurance companies do not provide any tangible benefits to their customers
until tragedy strikes,&quot; TD Life President and Chief Executive Officer Derek Thompson
said. &quot;With TD LifeLine, our customers will have an on-going  service that will make a
positive difference in their day-to-day lives.&quot; 

<P>TD LifeLine will be offered with all customer-paid TD Life policies. Starting with an
Accidental Death Plan, the company will roll-out a full range of life and health insurance
products over the next few months.

<P>&quot;These days we are all concerned about health care and, as we continue to age, 
lifestyle becomes all the more important,&quot; Thompson continued. &quot;TD LifeLine will
address both health and lifestyle issues in a way that is convenient, fast and friendly. It's a whole
new way of looking at servicing life insurance customers.&quot;

<P>Initially, TD Life products are being made available by direct mail offers to TD Bank
customers. According to Dan Burns, TD Life's Vice President of Marketing and Quality
Delivery, &quot;TD LifeLine is just one example of the innovative approach we bring to the
insurance marketplace. By focusing on the changing needs of our customers, we will provide the
products and services that deliver real peace of mind, every single day.&quot;

<h2>News Release - Communique</h2>

<h3>TD ASSET MANAGEMENT INC. AGREES TO ACQUIRE A 30% INTEREST IN
AMI PARTNERS INC.</h3>

<P>TORONTO - TD Asset Management Inc. announced today that TD has entered into an
agreement to purchase a 30 per cent interest in AMI Partners Inc.  AMI is one of Canada's
leading investment counsel firms providing investment management services to pension trusts,
mutual funds, government agencies, insurance companies, endowment funds, charitable
organizations and individuals in Canada and abroad.  AMI has $7.5 billion in assets under
management.

<P>TD Asset Management Inc., a subsidiary of The Toronto-Dominion Bank, manages passive
and active institutional portfolios for pension funds, corporations, institutions, endowments,
foundations; it offers private money management to high net-worth individuals and manages
mutual funds for retail investors.  It has $13.5 billion in assets under management.

<P>Under the terms of the agreement, AMI's Quantitative Capital and Private Capital divisions
will be merged into, and integrated with, TD Asset Management.  AMI Quantitative Capital is a
leading provider of Canadian index and quantitatively managed investment products for the
institutional market, and AMI Private Capital specializes in private money management services
for Canadian high net-worth individuals.  TD Asset Management will maintain the Montreal
office of the Quantitative Capital and Private Capital divisions.

<P>AMI's advisory and active institutional investment management business, with offices in
Vancouver, Toronto and Montreal, will continue to operate independently from TD Asset
Management as AMI Partners Inc.

<P>Robert MacLellan, Chairman, TD Asset Management, said, &quot;With this investment, TD
Asset Management now becomes Canada's leading provider of index products.  TDAM will
benefit from Quantitative Capital's research expertise in the area of enhanced index and
quantitative products and Private Capital's experience in the design of personal investment
portfolios, thereby expanding its capabilities as a full service investment manager in both
institutional and private money management.&quot;  Mr. MacLellan noted that he is particularly
pleased to be able to enhance TDAM's presence in the Province of Quebec.

<P>Carl Otto, Managing Director, AMI Partners, said, &quot;Joining forces with TD will allow
the Quantitative Capital and Private Capital divisions to focus on what they do best: to research
and develop new products, and to find innovative solutions to investment problems.  AMI will
continue to focus on meeting clients' present and future needs in a much simpler organizational
structure.  AMI and TDAM will share resources in order to continue the refinement of the
Tactical Asset Allocation model and to remain at the leading edge of development for this key
product.&quot;

<h3>Release Publication<br>Wednesday, June 5, 1996</h3>

<h2>News Release - Communique</h2>

<h3>GREEN LINE DISCOUNT BROKER OPENS IN HONG KONG</h3>

<P>TORONTO - Green Line Investor Services, Canada's largest discount brokerage firm, today
announced the opening of its office in Hong Kong, which will offer residents 24-hour access to
North American investment markets at low commission rates.

<P>The first Canadian discount broker to establish an office in Hong Kong, Green Line will
offer clients immediate access to North American markets through a computer from home, office
or car, by telephone access systems or by speaking to a Green Line representative.

<p>Clients can place orders for North American equity and fixed income products, government
and corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities, money-market instruments and options. 
Prompted by the expansion in Hong Kong, Green Line services are now available in Cantonese
and Mandarin 24 hours a day to both Hong Kong and Canadian clients. 

<P>Green Line's success and experience with Asian communities in Canada provided the
impetus for
the expansion of discount trading services to Hong Kong.  John G. See, President and Chief
Operating
Officer of Green Line Investor Services said, &quot;This expansion brings convenient,
easy-to-use
services to Hong Kong residents who want to invest in North American markets.&quot;

<P>Marc Lee, Manager and Director of Green Line's Hong Kong office said, &quot;Until now,
real-time access to North American markets hasn't been available to Hong Kong residents.  This
is a
tremendous opportunity for investors to lower their financial risk by diversifying investments
into
overseas markets at significant cost savings.  Our clients benefit from Green Line's commitment
to
customer service and award-winning technology.&quot;                                 
                                  
                                  
<p>Green Line's success to date in Canada's markets is due, in part, to the Mandarin and
Cantonese services it provides its clients.  Green Line also offers investment information, such as
research and seminars, to independent investors and has developed a catalogue of investment
research tools that are available to clients at a discounted price.  Green Line's award-winning
MicroMax service -- a proprietary real-time, on-line trading and information service -- provides
investors with an economical, efficient electronic environment for their trading and account
management activity.

<p>Green Line Investor Services was established in Canada in 1984 to offer discounted
brokerage commissions to Canadian investors who make their own investment decisions.  Green
Line expanded to the U.S. in 1995 and in April 1996 signed a merger agreement with
Waterhouse Investor Services Inc. of New York.  The merged company will be the third largest
discount broker in the world.

<P>Green Line Investor Services is a division of TD Securities Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary
of The Toronto-Dominion Bank, the fifth largest bank in Canada.

<h3>Release Publication<br>Thursday, May 30, 1996</h3>

<h2>News Release - Communique</h2>

<h3>TORONTO DOMINION REPORTS SECOND QUARTER EARNINGS OF $220
MILLION<br> </h3>

<p>TORONTO -  Your Bank continued to generate strong results in the second quarter,  with
earnings of $220 million, up 34% from the second quarter of 1995 and return on equity of 15.1%
compared to 12.1% the previous year.

<P>While delivering these solid year-over-year gains as well as continued improvement in credit
quality in the second quarter, TD made a major step forward with an agreement to acquire
Waterhouse Investor Services, Inc., the fourth largest discount brokerage in the United States. 
This move - which with Green Line Investor Services will create one of the largest discount
brokers in the world - reflects our strategies for growth and our vision of the future of banking.

<p>&quot;Our strategy has been to diversify TD's earning sources, entering new businesses
where we could add value to customers and meet their changing needs,&quot; said TD's
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Richard M. Thomson. &quot;Given the economic,
demographic and technological trends - and TD's strengths - our best route to generating superior
shareholder value is to focus on high growth areas which we believe will shape the future of
financial services,&quot; added Thomson.  Markets identified for increased development include
investment banking, mutual funds, investment management, computer and telephone banking,
card services including credit, debit and &quot;smart&quot; cards, and discount brokerage.

<p>&quot;The Waterhouse transaction, subject to approval by regulators and Waterhouse
shareholders, will effectively double our size in the rapidly growing discount brokerage business
and create the first North  American discount brokerage franchise,&quot; said TD's President,
Charles Baillie.  

<p>Waterhouse - which has 500,000 accounts and 80 offices in 37 states and the District of
Columbia - will join forces with Green Line, Canada's market leader. &quot;Both firms will
continue to operate under their current names and management, but we will see considerable
sharing of technology and expertise,&quot; added Baillie.

<p>The transaction is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter at a cost of US $535 million
in cash and TD stock - which we plan to list on the New York Stock Exchange.   We also plan to
buy back an offsetting number of shares to prevent shareholder dilution.   TD's strong capital
position will still provide the scope to pursue other opportunities in line with our growth
strategies.

<p>Our strategies are supported by the steady growth we have seen in other income as a percent
of net interest income - from less than 50% a year ago to over 60% this quarter.  Net interest
income in the second quarter, while virtually unchanged from the previous year, was down 4%
from the first quarter due to a 14 basis point decline in interest rate margins, whereas other
income was up 8%.

<P>The strongest gains in other income occurred in:
<ul>
<li> discount brokerage, where Green Line set new records for revenues and transactions;
<li> retail brokerage, where TD Evergreen Investment Services - which was recently tied for 
number  one in key areas important to brokers in an annual &quot;report card&quot; in
Investment Executive magazine - continued to grow rapidly with revenues more than double the
previous year and assets under administration of approximately $5 billion;
<li> mutual funds, which showed continued strength in sales after RRSP season, reached $7.7
billion in assets by the end of the quarter as market share continued to grow;
<li> investment banking revenues in both Canada and the U.S.</ul>

<p>With the development of our new businesses and increased marketing and advertising costs,
our
expense to gross profit ratio deteriorated slightly to 60.7%.  Our challenge is to improve
productivity while
continuing to make gains in service delivery.

<P>Our branches have been responding well to the challenge and to the changing shape of
banking with
expanded mutual fund and trust services and our Main$treet Banking  services for small
business.  These
and other service initiatives have contributed to strong growth in new accounts and non-term
deposits.  For
corporate clients, we have made strides with our integrated corporate and investment banking
strategy and
we have continued to develop services to meet changing needs.  For instance, in the second
quarter we
continued to accommodate our clients' global growth with the opening of a representative office
in Chile.

<P>During the third quarter, we will be rolling out our Personal Banker program - creating new
relationship management positions in our retail branches to better meet our customers'
increasingly
complex needs; we will be introducing Canada's first PC-based integrated home banking product
with
single entry access to business, personal and discount brokerage accounts; and we are proceeding
with
smart card development to provide a new dimension in payment services.

<p>With these initiatives and strong performances in all our businesses, we believe TD will
continue to
outperform the economy this year.  However, we are concerned by the continuing trend by
governments in
Canada to single out and penalize Canada's banks for profitable growth that benefits millions of
direct and
indirect shareholders.  New capital surtaxes imposed at the provincial level in Ontario apply only
to banks. 
We are hopeful that governments in Canada will begin to see that banks are an important national
asset
which must remain competitive in a global marketplace.

<P>In focusing on your Bank's competitiveness, we are working to deliver solid returns while
generating
future value for shareholders, and we believe we are on the right course. 

<h2><center>Review of Operating Performance</center></h2>

<P>Net income for the second quarter of 1996 was $220 million as your Bank continued to
generate
strong earnings during a period of moderate economic growth.  Net income increased $56 million
over a
year ago, and declined only $2 million from the preceding quarter.  Year-over-year favourable
results were
primarily achieved through record other income, as our non-interest revenue generating
businesses
continued to increase their earnings contribution.  Provision for credit losses was lower and
interest
recoveries were higher as a result of the continued improvement in the quality of the Bank's loan
portfolio.

<P>Net income per share for the second quarter of 1996 was $.70 compared to $.52 a year ago
and $.71
for the preceding quarter.  On a fully diluted basis, net income per share was $.69 compared to
$.51 last
year and $.70 last quarter.

<p>The increase in earnings, year-over-year, significantly improved return on assets from 0.64%
to 0.81%
and return on equity from 12.1% to 15.1%.

<p>As a result of the Bank's strong performance in the first half of 1996, net income increased to 
$442 million or $1.41 per share compared to the prior year's first half earnings of $343 million or
$1.08
per share.

<h3>Net interest income</h3>
Net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis was $630 million, virtually unchanged from
last year, as
a 6% increase in average earning assets was offset by an 18 basis points decline in margins to
2.56%.  The
growth in average assets was due to increased securities related trading activity which earns a
lower
interest margin than loans.  Non-mortgage lending declined from a year ago due to sluggish
economic
growth, repayments and a reduction in corporate lending activity where the return was not
commensurate
with the risk undertaken.  This change of mix in earning assets combined with considerably
lower interest
rates and heightened competition, particularly for quality residential mortgages and term
deposits, caused
the 18 basis points decline in the Bank's margin.  The lower level of interest rates led to a
significant
decline in the yields earned from investing non-interest bearing and low cost funds, including
shareholders' equity.

<p>These factors, partially offset by an increase in interest recoveries, resulted in interest
margins
declining 14 basis points compared to the prior quarter.

<P>Economic conditions continued to have a favourable impact on the equity markets and for
the sixth
consecutive quarter, the Bank realized more than $20 million in securities gains with $25 million
earned
this quarter.

<h3>Credit quality and provision for credit losses</h3>
As a result of continued improvement in the quality of loans to corporate borrowers in Canada,
net
impaired loans decreased $97 million during the quarter to $395 million at April 30, 1996.  Net
impaired
loans as a percentage of total loans and bankers' acceptances declined to 0.5%, the lowest level in
over a
decade.

<p>The estimated provision for credit losses for 1996 remains unchanged from the first quarter
at 
$170 million.  One quarter of the estimate for 1996, or $42 million, was charged against income
in the
second quarter.

<h3>Other income</h3>
Other income was a record $400 million in the quarter, increasing $99 million or 33% over the
prior year. 
This surpassed, by $26 million, the previous record of $374 million set in the fourth quarter of
1995. 
Other income contributed 38% of total revenue this quarter versus 31% in the second quarter last
year. 
This performance illustrates the importance of investing in new non-interest revenue generating
businesses
which help us meet the changing financial needs of our customers and diversify our sources of
revenue.

<p>As a result of higher trading volumes by our customers and expansion of operations, Green
Line
Investor Services, our discount broker, and TD Evergreen Investment Services, our full service
broker,
realized strong revenue growth.  This growth accounted for one-third of the increase in total other
income. 
The brokerage and mutual funds management businesses were beneficiaries of a strong RRSP
season.

<P>Foreign exchange and derivative products revenue and fees for services related to credit,
mergers and
acquisitions, and underwriting benefitted from favourable market conditions.  Increased sales
activity and
number of active cardholders led to increased card service revenue.

<p>Compared to the prior quarter, other income increased $30 million or 8%, with brokerage
revenue
representing over 50% of this increase.

<h3>Non-interest expenses</h3>
As the growth in expenses of 12% over the same quarter a year ago (excluding the acquisition
cost of
Lancaster) exceeded the growth in total revenues of 11%, the Bank's productivity ratio
deteriorated from
59.8% to 60.7%.  Of the increase in expenses, two-thirds is attributable to continued expansion
and
increased activity in our securities businesses and to performance related compensation.  In
addition, an
enhanced marketing campaign and further development of the Bank's computer and telephone
banking
systems led to increased expenses.

<h3>Balance Sheet</h3>

At April 30, 1996, total assets were $115 billion, an increase of $11 billion or 10% over a year
ago.  The
increase in assets was due to greater trading activity undertaken by the Bank which resulted in
increases in
securities held for trading, securities purchased under resale agreements and cash resources. 
Total loans
declined during this period as the increases in residential mortgages, personal loans and loans to
small and
mid-sized businesses in Canada only partially offset the decline in lending to large corporate
borrowers in
North America.

<p>A favourable development was the 5% increase in personal non-term deposits from a year
ago and 4%
increase compared to last quarter.  Mutual funds managed by the Bank again exhibited strong
growth as
customers continued to prefer mutual funds to term deposits in this low interest rate environment. 
At
quarter end, mutual funds totalled $7.7 billion compared to $5.1 billion last year.  This contrasts
with
personal term deposits which were virtually flat from a year ago.


<P>As a result of a further decline in market interest rates and continued strong equities markets,
the
market value of the Bank's securities portfolios held for investment and liquidity purposes at 
April 30, 1996 was $52 million above book value, compared to $40 million below book value at
October
31, 1995.

<h3>Capital</h3>
Earnings after dividends of $136 million for the quarter primarily accounted for the increase in
common
equity during the quarter.  Compared to last quarter end, risk-weighted assets have increased $1.3
billion. 
With these changes, the ratio of net common equity to risk-weighted assets remained unchanged
at 7.0%
from the previous quarter but up from 6.4% a year ago.

<h2>News Release - Communique</h2>

<h3>TD BANK FORMS ALLIANCE WITH THE ONTARIO CHAMBER OF
COMMERCE<br></h3>

<p>TORONTO - On the same day that The Ontario Chamber of Commerce opened its Annual
General Meeting in London, Ontario, TD Bank announced that it has formed a special alliance
with the Chamber to provide its members and their employees with a unique Group Benefit
Program of business, personal and asset management services, many at preferred rates.  In
addition, as part of this package, TD will work with the Chamber to develop business and
personal financial education programs to meet members' needs.

<P>Chamber members will have an opportunity to learn more about the new program during
their annual meeting this weekend.  With this special program, Ontario Chamber of Commerce
members and their employees can take advantage of discounted TD services as a business, as an
individual, and as an employer.

<p>&quot;We at TD want to provide our business customers the services they need in a
convenient and easily accessible way.  We want to be the bank of choice for small
business,&quot; says John Leckie, Senior Vice President, Business Banking Services. &quot;For
the Chamber's over 65,000 members, the new package offers preferred pricing on products such
as Merchant Visa services, Payroll services and our flat fee business account plan.&quot;

<p>The Ontario Chamber of Commerce Group Benefit Program is part of an overall approach to
business and personal banking which brings together the expertise of specialists from TD Bank,
TD Asset Management, TD Trust, Evergreen Investment Services and Green Line Investor
Services, and puts them at the service of the business customer.

<p>&quot;Chamber members are employers as well, so we have put together an Employee
Banking and asset management program allowing employees to take advantage of the same
preferred pricing on personal banking products and services as their employer,&quot; added Greg
Levi, Manager, Business Group Services. &quot;Our Group Benefit Program for employees
complements the employers' traditional benefit program.&quot;

<p>Some of the special offers available to employees of Chamber members include:
<li>Guaranteed discounts on published TD mortgage rates;</li>
<li>Guaranteed discounts on TD personal credit rates;</li>
<li>Guaranteed premiums on TD GICs, and TD GIC RRSPs;</li>
<li>Guaranteed savings on personal TD Service Plans, for deposit accounts at TD.</li>

<p>The Ontario Chamber of Commerce is the largest organization to participate in a TD Group
Benefit Program which encompasses business and personal banking, and asset management
options. However, TD has over 200 group programs in place and plans to expand further.
&quot;Over the next several months we shall offer similar Group Benefit Programs to other
provincial Chambers of Commerce across the country,&quot; added John Leckie.

<h3>TD BANK ANNOUNCES LOWER INTEREST RATE ON ITS EMERALD VISA
CARD <br></h3>

<p>TORONTO - TD Bank announced today that it will lower the interest rate by 1 per cent on
its TD EMERALD Visa Card to 11.9 per cent effective May 1.  TD EMERALD, launched last
year by TD Visa to offer customers an alternative to higher interest rates, has been committed to
offering the lowest Visa rate in Canada.

<p>&quot;When we launched TD EMERALD last June, we wanted to offer cardholders a choice
when it came to credit,&quot; says Barb Cromb, Associate Vice President, TD Visa.
&quot;Being the first to launch a no-fee Visa Card in Canada - the hugely successful GM Card -
it was only fitting that we looked at meeting the needs of other customers, namely those who
carry a balance and want to save on interest charges.&quot; 

<P>Cromb says with the continuing decline in the bank rate, TD wanted to pass along added
savings to its customers.

<P>TD Bank offers a wide range of Visa products, including the TD Gold Travel Card, the GM
Card, TD Green Classic Card, TD Business and the newest card, TD Purchase Manager card.

<h2>News Release - Communique</h2>

<h3>TD BANK ANNOUNCES LAUNCH OF NEW PURCHASE MANAGER VISA
CARD <br></h3>

<p>TORONTO - Toronto Dominion Bank today announced the launch of its new TD Purchase
Manager Visa Card.  Designed for any size business, this card is used for small-dollar purchases,
eliminating invoices and purchase orders.

<p>&quot;The Purchase Manager Visa Card helps make it easier for our customers by
eliminating time consuming processes and helping them save money,&quot; says Barb Cromb,
Associate Vice President, Card and Direct Services.

<p>The TD Purchase Manager Visa Card streamlines the complete purchasing and payments
process:<br>

<ul>
<li>small-dollar purchases are made directly by authorized staff<br>
<li>vendors are paid directly by Visa<br>
<li>immediate dollar and time savings in the reduction of paper with only one statement
received, and one convenient payment made per month<br><br></ul>

<P>In addition, the Card offers various reporting options that will reduce the time a company
spends each month recording, reporting and allocating expenses for these purchases.  For
example, the InfoSpan Desktop Reporting System for the TD Purchase Manager Visa Card is a
flexible and useful software package that provides a series of twenty electronic reports.  These
reports will provide information such as a company's biggest supplier, its most active buyers and
its most active categories of purchases.

<p>The TD Purchase Manager Visa Card is a total system that provides for faster purchasing,
and makes cost accounting easier.  

<p>TD Bank has been active in the commercial card market for over three years.  This new
product completes the line-up that began with: the Corporate Card used by small businesses to
separate their personal from their business expenses; and the TD Business Visa Card used by
business travellers for travel and entertainment expenses.

<h3>STATEMENT FROM THE TORONTO-DOMINION BANK REGARDING MAPLE
LEAF GARDENS<br></h3>

<p>TORONTO - The Toronto-Dominion Bank is pleased that the parties involved in the dispute
over the purchase of Maple Leaf Gardens have arrived at a settlement.

<p>In the course of the dispute, allegations were made that the TD Bank and its wholly-owned
subsidiary TD Capital Group, Ltd. had access to inside information.  This allegation was and
remains completely false.  Further, the Bank and TD Capital Group, Ltd. at all times acted in a
completely legal and proper manner in connection with these transactions.

<p>The allegations relate to views conveyed to the Bank by Mr. Stavro as to the potential value
of future broadcast contracts.  The fact that these contracts were coming up for renegotiation had
been publicly known since 1991.  Moreover, Mr. Stavro's views were conveyed prior to the
beginning of any negotiations concerning the contracts.  The ultimate value of those contracts
proved to be materially lower than the amount Mr. Stavro conveyed in the estimate he offered
when negotiating with the Bank for credit in connection with the proposed acquisition.

<h3>WATERHOUSE TO JOIN FORCES WITH GREEN LINE, CANADA'S LARGEST
DISCOUNT BROKER<br></h3>

<p>TORONTO - The Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD Bank) and Waterhouse Investor Services
Inc. (Waterhouse) announced today that they have signed a merger agreement following the
completion of which Waterhouse and Green Line Investor Services (Green Line) will join forces
to become one of the largest discount brokers in North America.

<p>TD Bank will pay Waterhouse shareholders approximately CAD$715MM (US$525MM), 
35 per cent in cash and 65 per cent in common stock.  The agreement provides for the merger of
Waterhouse with a newly-formed subsidiary of TD Bank.  In the merger, Waterhouse
shareholders can elect to receive either US$38 in TD Bank common stock (based on its market
price at the time of the merger) or US$38 in cash, subject to proration so that 65 per cent of the
merger consideration is paid in stock and 35 per cent in cash.  The merger will be tax-free to
Waterhouse shareholders to the extent they receive TD Bank stock.  The transaction is subject to
approval by Canadian and American regulatory authorities, as well as Waterhouse shareholders,
and is expected to be completed by August 31, 1996.

<p>Green Line and Waterhouse will continue to operate under their current names.  In addition,
Waterhouse founder Lawrence M. Waterhouse Jr., has made a long-term commitment to
continue as Chairman and CEO.  Management and employees will remain unchanged and there
is no loss of employment anticipated attributable to this business combination.

<p>Larry Waterhouse said, "the discount brokerage business is specialized and requires
substantial experience in order to succeed.  Waterhouse takes pride in being independently
ranked as one of the leading discount brokerage firms in America. We believe that Green Line's
proven leadership as the largest discount broker in Canada, its commitment to customer service,
and its state-of-the-art technology will make this a winning business combination for our
stockholders, customers and associates."

<p>W. Keith Gray, Executive Vice President of The Toronto-Dominion Bank and Chairman and
CEO of Green Line said, "Waterhouse is a top quality, exceptionally well-managed discount
broker that obviously fits well with Green Line's business.  We share and have demonstrated the
same commitment to customer service, which augurs well for our future in this business.

<p>This merger clearly demonstrates our long-term commitment to growing the discount
brokerage business.  With in excess of 70 per cent of Canadian discount brokerage transactions
and years of experience, Green Line thoroughly understands this business.

<p>By joining with a leading U.S. firm, we believe our Canadian customers will benefit from a
broader range of products and services."

<p>Waterhouse is one of the leading national discount brokers in America with 1300 associates
serving more than 500,000 accounts through 79 branch offices in 37 States and the District of
Columbia. 

<p>Green Line, in addition to being Canada's largest discount broker, leads the industry in the
delivery of personal computer services with its acclaimed Green Line MicroMax PC-based
electronic delivery system.  Green Line MicroMax provides customers with convenient access to
accounts and market information, on-line order entry and real-time trading.

<p>The TD Bank is North America's 14th largest bank with assets of more than CAD$106
billion (US$78 billion) and equity of CAD$6.2 billion (US$4.6 billion).  Rated AA by both
Moody's Investors Service and Standard and Poor's, TD Bank has the highest securities rating of
any Canadian bank.

<p>As evidence of its long-term commitment to the U.S. market, the Bank intends to seek a
listing on the New York Stock Exchange for its common shares.  TD Bank also said that it
intends, subject to regulatory approval, to re-purchase an offsetting amount of common shares in
accordance with applicable securities regulation.

<p>The merger will occur between Waterhouse and a new subsidiary of the Bank.  TD Bank will
account for the merger as a purchase transaction with overall earnings dilution in 1996 and 1997 
not expected to be material.

<h3>TD'S MORTGAGE CAMPAIGN OFFERS 0% MORTGAGE INTEREST

FOR 3 MONTHS <br></h3>





<p>TORONTO - Toronto Dominion Bank swings into spring offering its mortgage customers an

interest

rebate up to $5,000 or 0% interest for 3 months on 5 year term mortgages.



<p>TD's <A

HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/Your_Home/special.html">&quot;pay no interest&quot;</a> mortgage

event is for customers taking out a new residential mortgage or

transferring an existing mortgage to a TD five year mortgage.  Based on the mortgage principal

amount at

the time of advance, customers have the opportunity to receive a 3 month mortgage interest

rebate, up to

$5,000.



<p>"With mortgage rates lower than last spring and a lid still on housing prices, potential home

buyers

have a window of opportunity to enter the market with the right combination of affordability and

financing," said Bruce Shirreff, Senior Vice President, Mortgages.



<p>With this offer, customers receive a one time rebate equivalent to 3 months' interest when the

mortgage closes.  Homeowners have the option of using the rebate to help offset mortgage

payments or

homebuying costs such as moving expenses, real estate fees, property taxes and legal fees.  Or

the rebate

can be used as a lump sum repayment which will save thousands in interest costs over the life of

the

mortgage.



<p>The 0% Mortgage Interest campaign is available on 5 year mortgages booked by June 28 and

advanced

by August 30, 1996.  This offer cannot be combined with rate discounts or any other incentive;

some exceptions apply.  For more information, please contact your local TD branch or visit TD's

<h3>TD BANK TEAMS UP WITH CHBA-BC OFFERING HOMEOWNERS
RENOVATION FINANCING DIRECT FROM THE CONTRACTOR'S OFFICE
<br></h3>

<p>VANCOUVER- Homeowners can now apply for financing the cost of their home
renovations directly from the contractor's office through a new service offered by GreenLight
Financial Services, a division of TD Bank. 

<p>With this program, clients apply for on the spot financing, and based on a cost estimate for
renovations, receive a decision within just a few hours.

<p>GreenLight's highly automated credit application process allows for decisions to be made
quickly and conveniently.  Together with the Canadian Home Builder Association of B.C.,
GreenLight Financial Services offers competitive interest rates with a wide range of repayment
terms from 1 year to 20 years. Renovation loans can be partially prepaid or paid in full at any
time without penalty.

<p>"More and more people choose to do home renovations instead of buying a new home, and
home renovations have even replaced other discretionary expenses such as travelling or buying a
new vehicle," says Stephen Stewart, Vice President, Personal Lending.  "Now homeowners can
benefit from one-stop shopping at the contractor's office and from competitive interest rates."

<p>Contractors participating in this program benefit from receiving prompt and full payment
upon the completion of the renovation helping them to reduce their accounts receivable and
eliminate credit risk and collection costs.

<P>"This is a win-win program for both homeowners and contractors," added Stewart. 
"Homeowners get quick access to low cost financing, and contractors receive prompt payment
upon completion of the work.  We think this program will help contractors round out the service
they offer their clients, from the initial planning stages right through to the financing."    

<p>"We are certainly pleased that professional renovators have this opportunity to enter into an
exciting partnership with a leading financial institution such as TD Bank," said Neil Ziola,
President of the Canadian Home Builder Association of B.C.

<p>GreenLight Financial Services, a division of TD Bank, is a recognized leader in innovative
personal financial services offering centralized, quick response credit for a wide variety of
dealers and agents across Canada.

<h3>Release Publication<br>Thursday, March 28, 1996</h3>

<h2>News Release - Communique</h2>

<h3>SMALL BUSINESS IN WESTERN CANADA'S ENVIRONMENTAL
TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY NURTURED BY NEW $40 MILLION INVESTMENT
LOAN PROGRAM <br></h3>

<p>VANCOUVER, B.C. - A new $40 million loan program providing much need access to
patient debt financing for small and medium-sized businesses in Western Canada's
environmental technologies industry was announced today at Globe  96, an international
environmental trade fair and conference, by Dr. Jon Gerrard, Secretary of State for Western
Economic Diversification, Environment Minister Sergio Marchi, and Arnold Fenrick, Vice
President, Commercial Services, Pacific Division, TD Bank.

<p>"Increased public awareness, enhanced environmental protection efforts and legislation and
the development of new technologies are providing tremendous opportunities for Western
Canada's environmental technologies industry," said Dr. Gerrard.  "Despite these prospects,
access to both debt and equity financing has traditionally been a problem for these firms.  This
new loan program addresses that problem directly and will play a key role in creating new high-value jobs and new technologies needed to clean and protect the environment at home and
abroad."

<p>"Environment Canada's technical expertise plays an important role in the implementation of
this program which supports research, development and technological innovation.  This program
will create economic benefits and green jobs for Western Canada, while working with a major
financial institution and the environmental industry in addressing key environmental priorities,"
said Minister Marchi.  "It is an excellent example of government and private sector partnership."

<p>The Toronto Dominion Bank, in cooperation with Western Economic Diversification Canada
(WD) and Environment Canada (EC), is establishing the $40 million loan program, with WD
providing up to $5 million to establish a loan loss reserve to lever the $40 million in loan capital. 
EC will contribute up to $1.8 million over seven years under the Canadian Environmental
Industry Strategy to support the technical and business reviews of projects.  All parities will share
in the risk, and the agreement provides for the return of remaining monies in the loan loss reserve
to WD at the program's conclusion.

<p>"We're happy to become a partner with Western Economic Diversification and Environment
Canada and expand our service to small and medium-sized businesses," said Edward Knash,
Manager, Agriculture/Agribusiness - Alberta Division, TD Bank.  "This program targets an
important industry which will identify innovative environmental initiatives and make significant
contributions to the economy in Western Canada."

<p>Western Canada's environment technology sector offers high growth and significant export,
diversification and employment potential.  Currently there are more than 2,000 businesses
throughout the four western provinces producing or supplying technologies, products, processes
and services to monitor and assess pollutants, minimize or eliminate contaminants, or clean or
restore the environment.  Over 70 per cent of these firms earn their revenues in excess of $2
billion which, along with employment levels, are expected to double by the year 2000.

<p>A key feature of the loan program will see WD and EC offer their in-house resources and
extensive business networks to help applicants fine tune their business cases and enhance their
prospects of securing loan capital.  Loans can range to a maximum of $500,000 per project and
$1 million per borrower to finance research and development; innovative scientific and technical
services for environmental conservation, protection or enhancement; and, market development
and expansion.

<p>To better respond to each firm's individual needs, flexibility is a prominent feature of this
program and includes repayment terms of up to seven years and the ability to delay principal and
interest payments for up to two years.

<p>Eligible firms must have less than 150 employees and less then $10 million in annual sales. 
Interested companies should contact Western Economic Diversification offices in Winnipeg,
Saskatoon, Edmonton or Vancouver to obtain initial application information.

<p>The Environmental Technology Loan program is an example of how the government is
priorizing its spending so that it can better serve Canadians by making efficient use of their tax
dollars.

<p>Funding for this program was provided for in the March 1996 federal budget and is therefore
built into the existing fiscal framework.

<h3>Release Publication<br>Thursday, February 29, 1996</h3>
<h2>News Release - Communique</h2>

<h3>TORONTO DOMINION REPORTS FIRST QUARTER EARNINGS OF $222
MILLION<br></h3>

<p>TORONTO - Toronto Dominion Bank today announced that it is off to a good start in 1996
with first quarter earnings of $222 million, up 24% from the first quarter of 1995.  Return on
equity, our key benchmark for the delivery of shareholder value, improved to 15.2% from 13.2%
the previous year.  Our
productivity ratio also improved from 60.2% a year ago to 59.4% this quarter.

<p>&quot;We are pleased to report that improvements were once again widespread, with solid
year-over-year gains in both net interest income and other income,&quot; said TD's Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer, Richard M. Thomson.

<p>&quot;While asset growth has been modest, reflecting the slow economic growth that
continues in
Canada, net interest income grew by 11% from the previous year due to further improvements in
credit
quality and margins,&quot; said TD's President, Charles Baillie.  &quot; Net impaired loans
(formerly net
non-accrual loans), at .6% of loans and bankers' acceptances, were at their lowest level in over
ten years
and our loan loss estimate for 1996 is $170 million, a further improvement over the low level
achieved in
1995,&quot; added Baillie.

<p>Other income grew by 17% from the first quarter of 1995, reflecting strong performances in
mutual fund, credit card, discount brokerage and investment banking businesses.

<p>Taxes and government levies for the quarter increased 30% over last year to $219 million,
and represented 99% of net income.

<p>TD people throughout the Bank continued to enhance relationships with personal and
business customers during the quarter.  Highlights of activities during the quarter include:

<p><li><b>TD establishes mutual fund leadership</b></li><br>
We saw major growth in our Green Line Family of No-Load Mutual Funds - two of which
ranked in the top ten funds in Canada in the twelve months to January 31, 1996 - as we benefited
from both strong fund performance and the superior skills of 5,000 people in our branches who
are qualified fund salespeople.  TD Bank was ranked #1 of 12 major Canadian financial
institutions in a Marketing Solutions &quot;mystery shopper&quot; survey about mutual fund
advice and knowledge at the branches in 19 out of 19 cities.  With this solid foundation, we have
moved ahead as the first bank in Canada to sell other brand name mutual funds besides our own
in our branches.  We also introduced  the TD Asset Accumulator Account - consolidating TD
and other mutual funds and investments in one account - making it easier for customers to
manage asset allocation and foreign content.<br>

<p><li><b>TD Securities gains further share</b></li><br>
During the quarter, we combined various securities subsidiaries (including Toronto
Dominion Securities, Green Line Investor Services, our discount broker, and TD Evergreen
Investment Services, our full service broker) to create TD Securities Inc. - making us comparable
to other Canadian securities dealers.  With 2,000 employees in 58 offices around the world, TD
Securities has become a significant player in the Canadian marketplace.

<p>We saw continued growth and share gains in our mergers and acquisitions, institutional
equities and fixed income businesses during the quarter and in retail distribution, as both Green
Line and Evergreen had their most active quarter to date.  We have also seen outstanding success
in two new businesses we entered in the latter part of 1995:  our new Eurobond business in
London, and our new high yield securities group in New York.  The Eurobond team has already
established an impressive track record, ranking as the number two underwriter of Euro Canadian
bonds for 1995 and lead-managing the #1 and #2 deals of the year, according to Euroweek
Magazine.

<p><li><b>Main$treet Banking makes gains with small business</b></li><br>
We continued with our Main$treet Banking program during the quarter, expanding delivery
of business banking services for small business customers through our branch network.  We have
seen an increase in branch volumes of small business borrowers indicating the success of the
program and the positive response of our customers to our various small business initiatives. 
The quality of one of our key initiatives was recently confirmed by the Metropolitan Halifax
Chamber of Commerce, which singled out TD's Business Planner as the best of all planning tools
offered by banks and associations.  Members of the evaluating committee gave high marks not
just to our Planner but to the knowledge and advice of TD branch staff.

<p>As we look ahead, we expect moderate economic growth in Canada in 1996.  We are hopeful
that the federal government will continue to reduce the deficit, which will ultimately improve
Canada's standing in both domestic and international financial markets.  In the meantime, we at
TD will continue in our efforts to outperform the economy by developing new businesses and
making it easier for our customers.<br>

<b><center><h3>Review of Operating Performance </b></center></h3>

<p>Your Bank continued to generate strong earnings as net income in the first quarter of 1996
was $222
million, an increase of $43 million over a year ago, and down only $4 million from the preceding
record
quarter.  The improvement from a year ago was due to wider margins and higher other income
together
with a lower provision for credit losses.

<p>Net income per share for the first quarter of 1996 was $.71 compared to $.56 for a year ago
and $.72
for the preceding quarter.  On a fully diluted basis, net income per share was $.70 compared to
$.56 last
year and $.71 last quarter.

<p>These strong earnings resulted in increases in return on assets from .69% to .83% and return
on
common equity from 13.2% to 15.2% for the quarter.

<p><b>Net interest income</b><br>
Net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis increased $70 million or 12% from a year
ago to
$660 million.  This significant growth resulted from a 3% increase in average earning assets and
a 21 basis
point improvement in the net interest margin to 2.70% primarily due to the favourable impact of
lower
funding costs resulting from lower market interest rates.  Compared to the preceding quarter, the
margin
improved 4 basis points.

<p>As equity markets continued to be strong during the quarter, the Bank realized $21 million in
net
investment securities gains, which is the fifth consecutive quarter in which the Bank achieved
securities
gains in excess of $20 million.

<p><b>Credit quality and provision for credit losses</b><br>
Net impaired loans decreased $212 million during the quarter to $492 million at January 31,
1996 or .6%
of total loans and bankers' acceptances, the lowest level in over ten years.  The decrease is a
result of
continued improvement in the quality of loans to large corporate borrowers in Canada and the
United
States.

<p>As a result of the high credit quality of the Bank's loan portfolio, the estimate for the
provision for
credit losses for 1996 is $170 million, a reduction from $180 million for the previous year.  One
quarter of
the estimate for 1996, or $43 million, was charged against income in the first quarter.

<p><b>Other income</b><br>
The importance of the growth in the Bank's fee generating businesses is reflected in other
income,
which at $370 million for the quarter, increased $54 million or 17% over the prior year.  Our
substantial
ongoing investments in securities related businesses, combined with favourable market
conditions, was the
primary driving force behind this increase.  Higher trading volumes in the equity markets and
expansion of
operations created strong growth in brokerage commissions from Green Line Investor Services,
our
discount broker, and TD Evergreen Investment Services, our full service broker.  The buoyant
markets also
helped the strong performance achieved in underwriting, mergers and acquisitions and corporate
credit fees
as well as foreign exchange.

<P>Compared to the prior quarter, which was a record, other income declined $4 million.

<p><b>Non-interest expenses</b><br>
The Bank's productivity ratio for the quarter improved to 59.4% from 60.2% experienced in
the first
quarter of 1995 and 62.5% in the previous  quarter.  The improvement over the same quarter a
year ago
was the result of strong growth in total revenue which increased 13%, while non-interest
expenses
increased 12%.  Of the increase in expenses, 9% is attributable to continued expansion and
increased
activity of our securities businesses in North America and to performance-related compensation.

<p><b>Balance Sheet</b><br>
At January 31, 1996, total assets were $107 billion, an increase of 4% over a year ago.  This
growth
was entirely due to increases in cash resources, securities purchased under resale agreements and
trading
securities, arising from increased trading activity by the Bank.  Total lending contracted during
the period
as increases in residential mortgages, personal loans and loans to small and mid-sized businesses
were
more than offset by reductions in loans to large corporate borrowers in  North America.

<p>As a result of further declines in market interest rates and strong equities' markets, the market
value of
the Bank's securities portfolios held for investment and liquidity purposes at January 31, 1996
was $114
million above cost, compared to $40 million below cost at October 31, 1995.

<p>All of the $.6 billion or 1% growth from a year ago in personal deposits resulted from
increases in term
deposits by individuals.  This low growth contrasts with the $1.4 billion or 26% growth in the 31
mutual
funds managed by the Bank.

<p><b>Capital</b><br>
During the quarter, the Bank's common equity grew $175 million, as earnings after dividends
totalled
$147 million and unrealized foreign currency gains from translation of investments in the Bank's
foreign
subsidiaries were $27 million.

<p>As a result of this growth in capital, combined with virtually no growth in risk-weighted
assets, the
Bank's ratio of net common equity to risk-weighted assets rose from 6.4% a year ago to 7.0%, its
highest
level since 1988 when this measurement was first introduced.

<h3>Release Publication<br>Tuesday, February 27, 1996</h3>
<h2>News Release - Communique</h2>

<h3>TORONTO DOMINION BANK INTRODUCES DENTAL CARE FINANCING DIRECT
FROM THE DENTAL OFFICE<br></h3>

<p>VANCOUVER - Individuals with little or no dental insurance coverage can now apply to
finance the cost of their treatment directly from their dentist's office through GreenLight
Financial Services, a division of TD Bank.  With Health Direct Dental Financing
patients can apply for financing on the spot, based on a cost estimate of the work required, and
receive a decision prior to leaving the dentist's office.

<p>With GreenLight's highly automated credit application process, decisions are made quickly
and conveniently.  For example, telephone applications will receive a decision within 30 minutes. 
Health Direct offers competitive interest rates with a wide range of repayment terms from
one to five years, and loans can be partially prepaid or paid in full at any time without penalty.  In
addition, there is no user fee to the patient and the dentist does not have to guarantee the loans.

<p>"More and more people are undergoing treatments not covered by insurance plans, or are
employed by small firms who offer limited or no dental coverage," says George Ramsay,
Associate Vice President, Pacific Division.  "Now patients can apply for financing rather than
using credit cards, personal resources or having to arrange for a payment plan with their dentist."

<p>Health Direct also benefits dentists by providing them with full and prompt payment
at the time of treatment, helping to reduce their accounts receivable and eliminate credit risk and
collection costs on patients' accounts. 

<p>"This is a win-win for both patients and dentists.  Patients get quick access to low cost
financing, and dentists are able to reduce their receivable debt and account collection costs.  We
think this program will also help dentists build their patient base," continues Ramsay.

<p>Health Direct was developed by Canadian dentists, practice management specialists
and health care financing experts to provide an effective solution to a growing need for
Canadians.

<p>Initially, this program is being offered in British Columbia but will be made available in
other provinces during the course of the year. 

<p>GreenLight Financial Services, a division of TD Bank, is a recognized leader in innovative
personal financial services offering centralized, quick response credit for a wide variety of
dealers and agents across Canada. 

<p>For more information, dentists and patients interested in Health Direct Dental Financing can
call 1-800-650-8085.

<h3>TD's "BUSINESS PLANNER" RECEIVES TOP RATING <br>

</h3>
<p>HALIFAX - TD Bank's Business Planner software has impressed the Metropolitan Halifax
Chamber of Commerce, receiving the top rating in the Chamber's evaluation of various business
planning kits produced by several financial agencies and institutions.
<p>In their evaluation, the Chamber of Commerce Committee stated that "on the whole the TD
Bank document was ranked very high by the group.  It was easy to read and had a comprehensive
glossary.  The credit application was considered very good."   In addition, upon requesting
Business Planner at several TD branches, members of the evaluating committee were impressed
to find that TD staff were knowledgeable about the planner and all had copies immediately
available.
<p>"Evaluations like this are useful to both parties," says Jeff Somerville, Senior Vice President,
Atlantic Division.  "The small business community benefits by having a detailed comparison of
the type of business planning tools available to them and we are provided with constructive
feedback on the effectiveness of our product."
<p>Criteria used in assessing the business planning kits included cost, applicability to Small
Business, glossary, user friendliness, financial planning forms and application forms. 
<p>"Business Planner was designed to provide small businesses with a comprehensive financial
planning guide, giving them a road map of where their business is presently and where it is
headed in the future.  It's gratifying to have endorsement from a third party that we have been
successful in our efforts," continues Somerville.
<p>TD Business Planner is available in paper and diskette format at no-charge from any TD
branch or at <a
HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/Small_Business/BUSPLANLIC.HTML"> TD's World 
Wide Web site.</A>  It is an
easy to use software program that enables customers to prepare business plans using their PC,
including features such as:
<ul>
<li> A Help menu and glossary of financial terms;
<li>Simple spreadsheets on which can be entered financial statement information with an
automatic feature that permits "what if" calculations;
<li>Documents can be printed on a wide variety of printers;
<li> Software application reference guide schematic included with disk.</ul>
<p>Business Planner is one of several initiatives introduced by TD Bank to assist small
business which include TD's Business Service Plan, the $5 Service Guarantee and offering a free
pocketbook - "How to succeed in your home business".  In addition, TD offers full business
banking services at all branches throughout Atlantic Canada.

<h3>Release Publication<br>Tuesday, January 30, 1996</h3>



<h2>News Release - Communique</h2>



<h3>CANADIAN ECONOMIC GROWTH TO REMAIN MODEST IN 1996, SAY TD ECONOMISTS

</h3><br>

<p>TORONTO -  The Canadian economy will continue to expand at a modest pace in 1996,

according to economists at the Toronto Dominion Bank writing in the January 1996 issue of

<u>Canada's Business Climate</u>.



<P>The decline in interest rates since the spring of 1995 will encourage a mild revival in

residential construction activity and a slight pickup in consumer spending, and Canadian exports

will benefit from continued U.S. economic expansion and somewhat faster growth in most

overseas industrialized economies.  "Canadian export growth will be critical for Canada's

economic performance in 1996, as it was in 1995," says Anna Guthrie, 

Senior Economist.  With growth in exports expected to outpace growth in imports, Canada's

current account deficit will fall from an estimated $15 billion in 1995 to about $10 billion in

1996, the smallest deficit since 1985.<br>



<p>Guthrie indicates that factors such as high levels of personal debt, a low savings rate and

concern over job security will continue to keep growth in domestic spending slower than normal. 

At the same time, all levels of government will be continuing, or embarking upon, programs of

fiscal restraint.  "This is difficult and painful in the short run," Guthrie notes, "however, progress

is being made by Canadian governments in putting their finances in order."



<p>TD economists expect growth in real gross domestic product (GDP) to average 2.0 per cent

in 1996 and accelerate to 2.5 per cent in 1997.  With further downsizing of public-sector

employment continuing to limit overall job growth in 1996-97, the unemployment rate is not

expected to fall below 9 per cent over the forecast period.  Moderate economic growth will keep

the Canadian rate of inflation below 2 per cent in 1996-97, and below the U.S. rate of inflation. 

Economic conditions favour further declines in Canadian interest rates, but unresolved

constitutional issues leave Canada vulnerable to upward pressure on rates.

<h3>Release Publication<br>Thursday, January 25, 1996</h3>

<h2>News Release - Communique</h2>

<h3>TD GREEN LINE INTRODUCES A NEW, MORE PROFITABLE WAY TO
TRADE IN NASDAQ STOCKS
</h3>
<p><b>TORONTO Ont.</B> - Green Line Investor Services, Canada's Discount Broker,
announces the implementation of Green Line Best Price Trading System on NASDAQ listed
stocks.  Through the use of advanced technology, customers placing orders on NASDAQ stocks
quoted with a price spread of 1/8 or greater, will automatically receive a price improvement on
executed trades.  Based on a price spread matrix the price improvement could be anywhere from
1/64 to 1/8 (the wider the spread the greater the price improvement).

<P>"Green Line's operating philosophy is always "The Customer First".  We are, therefore, very
pleased to introduce this service which will benefit all Canadian retail investors trading in
NASDAQ listed equities," says John See, President of Green Line.

<P>Whenever a NASDAQ order is executed that has a price spread of 1/8 or greater, Green Line
Best Price Trading System will automatically adjust the order fill price to reflect the appropriate
price improvement.  However, this system will not intervene in those instances when an order
has been filled in accordance with the limit price protection provision of the Manning II rule. 
This regulation requires market makers who purchase stock at a customers limit price to pass the
stock to the customer.


<P>The following is an example of how the Best Price trading system works:
<UL>
<PRE><LI>Current Quote          B - 19.0/              19.6/ - A
<LI>Order                  Buy @ 19 3/4
<LI>Filled at              19.5 (19 5/8)
</UL></PRE>

Since the system was first implemented on December 5, 1995, at least 50 per cent of all
NASDAQ orders executed by Green Line, on behalf of their clients, have benefited from Best
Price Trading System (up to January 18, 1996).

"Best Price Trading guarantees that Green Line clients will purchase NASDAQ stocks at a price
better than that posted on the exchange's electronic system, by an average of 
12 per cent for immediately executable orders having bid/ask spreads of 1/8 or greater," 
says See.

This new technology is available exclusively to Green Line clients and is one more way Green
Line sets the standard by which other retail brokers are measured.

<h2>News Release - Communique</h2>

<h3>TD PRESIDENT ACKNOWLEDGES EMPLOYEE EFFORTS<br>
AND HIGHLIGHTS SUCCESSFUL GROWTH STRATEGIES
</h3>
<p>TORONTO Ont. -TD Bank President A. Charles Baillie says that TD's employees are setting
the Bank apart from the competition by cultivating new businesses, launching new initiatives,
and implementing successful strategies.

<P>"Your Bank is not the office towers at King and Bay," Baillie said in his address to the
Bank's Annual Meeting of Shareholders today.  "Your Bank is thirty thousand people -- serving
customers, developing financial solutions, coming up with new ideas, leading and implementing
new businesses."

<P>At the meeting, Baillie acknowledged 122 employees who had received TD's first Awards of
Excellence, a recognition program recently developed and introduced by the Bank.  

<P>"These are all people who make a difference...helping to make the Bank a better place and
their communities a better place, with an exceptional level of caring and commitment, of
leadership and initiative".

<P>Noting that exceptional efforts were by no means limited to recipients of the Award of
Excellence, Baillie said that thousands of employees have worked to implement "Main$treet
Banking" services for small business customers throughout the branch network; thousands have
worked to integrate Trust services in selected TD Bank and Trust branches across Canada;
hundreds have worked to enhance electronic banking options, such as satellite banking in the
Yukon and to develop new products such as the TD VISA Cash card; hundreds have worked to
broaden TD's global reach in new offices and services in the United States, London, Mexico,
Singapore and India; and thousands have worked to make TD Securities Inc. a major player in
the securities industry. 

<P>Baillie pointed to employee efforts as the key to TD's superior progress in selling third party
paper and mutual funds in its branches -- broadening the choice of services available to
customers, and moving the Bank closer to one-source financial shopping.  

<P>According to Baillie, thanks to five thousand employees who have become qualified to
provide mutual funds to customers, "TD Bank was number one of twelve major financial
institutions in Canada in a survey about mutual funds knowledge and advice at the branches...
We are confident in moving ahead as the first bank in Canada to sell other brand name mutual
funds besides our own in our branches."

<P>Baillie gave credit to TD's employees for the Bank's strong financial performance in 1995.

<p>"We aim to do even better in the year ahead.  And we have the people, the management team,
and the strategies to get there."

<p>He said the Bank's key strategy for growth is building on the strengths that differentiate TD --
being the integrated bank, the bank of industry specialization, and the bank that helps make it
easier for customers by delivering superior service and advice.

<p>"We will be accountable," Baillie concluded.  "And we will make progress by making  Your
Bank. Your Way.' a reality for our customers."

<h3>Release Publication<br>Wednesday, January 24, 1996</h3>

<h2>News Release - Communique</h2>

<h3>BANK PROFITS DELIVER MAJOR BENEFITS TO CANADIANS --<br>
INCLUDING MILLIONS OF INDIRECT SHAREHOLDERS --  SAYS TD
CHAIRMAN<br><br>
</h3>
TORONTO Ont. -TD Bank's profits contribute to the financial security of millions of Canadians
who are indirect shareholders, while delivering major benefits to customers and contributing to
national prosperity, according to TD Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, 
Richard M. Thomson.

<P>Addressing the Bank's Annual Meeting of Shareholders in Toronto today, Thomson said his
message was "for the shareholders who are not here, the shareholders who do not even know they
are shareholders and who therefore do not know they are reaping the benefits of our profits."

<P>He noted that the largest shareholders of the Bank are pension funds and mutual funds, and
"that means that your Bank is mainly owned, directly and indirectly, by millions of hardworking
Canadians who are looking for some financial security in their retirement."

<p>"To all of those millions of Canadians who are part of pension plans or invest in mutual
funds, my message is that the Bank's profits are yours," he said.  "TD and the other banks
contribute to your financial security every time we make a profit, every time we pay a dividend,
every time we build shareholder value by building our businesses."


<P>"Profits that we don't pay out in dividends are reinvested in our business,"  Thomson said.
"That has built our capital base, which enables us to increase our lending activity and fuel
economic growth.  And we have also reinvested to improve competitiveness and customer
services."

<P>Thomson cited a range of benefits delivered by Canada's strong, stable, profitable,
competitive banking system:  safety and security for deposits; low interest rate spreads,
benefitting depositors and borrowers alike; same day value on deposits; the convenience of any
branch banking and national pricing across the country; high investments in technology which
has increased choice of low priced electronic delivery options and enabled TD to hold the line on
most service charges through the nineties; foreign earnings brought into Canada; and the high
level of taxes paid by the Canadian banks.

<p>"Clearly, the more money TD and the other banks make, the more we pay in taxes that pay
for government services.  And the more profits we make, the more we contribute to the
retirement income of millions of Canadians, the more we lend to customers, and the more we
improve economic activity and the wellbeing of Canadians." 

<p>Noting that the slow growth economic environment in Canada is likely to continue through
1996, Thomson said, "it's time we started celebrating success in this country -- success which
contributes to national prosperity."

<p>"I am proud of what TD people have achieved for our customers and our shareholders and all
Canadians," he concluded.

<h3>GREEN LINE EXPANDS ELECTRONIC DELIVERY OF BROKERAGE SERVICES</h3>

<P>TORONTO - Green Line Investor Services, Canada's Discount Broker, announces expansion of their electronic delivery brokerage services.  Green Line MicroMax, the award-winning on-line trading service, will feature timely news services and up to five years of historical quotation data for download by early February 1996.

<P>Through their MicroMax service, customers will have access to a special package of news from Dow Jones and Co., designed specifically for Green Line Investor Services.  The Dow Jones services will contain late breaking news on companies and industry groups, the Canadian, U.S. and International markets and press releases from Canada News Wire, PR Newswire and Business Wire.

<P>The new historical quotation feature will have seamless translation into the standard format of the most popular charting and graphing packages, both DOS and Windows-based.  

<P>&quot;Retail investors are looking for real-time information similar to that available to market professionals and, through MicroMax, we are providing this information to our clients,&quot; says John See, President of Green Line.  &quot;With the addition of timely news to the currently available real-time quotations and on-line trading, Green Line is the clear cut industry leader in the use of information technology to provide critical data and transactional services to their clients, when and where they want it.  Now investors are even better equipped to make informed investment decisions and the proof is in its popularity.&quot;

<P>Since its introduction in May 1992, over 50,000 Green Line customers have signed up for the award-winning MicroMax personal computer trading service.		

<P>Pricing for these new MicroMax services will be extremely competitive with other on-line news services which is in line with Green Line's value strategy.  &quot;But the real differentiation for Green Line is the integration of this new information with real-time quotations and on-line trading that are currently available within MicroMax,&quot; continues See.

<P>&quot;On-line transactional services, whether offered through the Internet or proprietary services like MicroMax, are bringing the future here today.  This is only the first of several announcements of enhancements to Green Line's electronic delivery network expected during 1996, which are anticipated to include real-time quotes and trading through the world wide web,&quot; says See.

<h3>TORONTO DOMINION UNVEILS TWO INNOVATIVE INDUSTRY INITIATIVES</h3>

<P>TORONTO - Mark Wettlaufer, President of TD Asset Management Inc. (TDAM), today announced two innovative industry initiatives:</P>

<OL><LI>TD has approval from most provincial Securities Commissions to sell other brand name mutual funds through its branch network -- a first for a financial institution in Canada.

<LI>Effective January 17, TD customers will be able to consolidate Green Line No-Load Mutual Funds with other brand name mutual funds, plus any other personal investments within a new account called the <B>TD Asset Accumulator Account</B>.  This one convenient account will help maximize foreign content, make it easier to design and maintain the proper asset mix, and combine the advice of TDAM with the low cost execution of Green Line Investor Services, Canada's largest discount brokerage.</OL>

<P>"We are now offering other brand name funds at a time when the performance of our Green Line No-Load Mutual Funds has never been stronger.  We are doing this to provide choice and unbiased advice to our investors as suggested by the Stromberg Report," said Mr. Wettlaufer.  "With more than 900 branches and a sales force of 5,000 across the country, TD has an obligation and the ability to provide the best possible service, range of fund products and financial counsel to make our customers successful investors."</P>

<P>The <B>Asset Accumulator Account</B> will feature comprehensive monthly statements and TD customers will be able to access their account and receive advice in an unparalleled number of ways: directly through their branch, by phone or via personal computer.</P>

<P>More in-depth education, information and consultation is available through TD's Investor Forums, TD's award-winning Internet site, bi-weekly Investor Bulletins and our toll-free Investment Hotline.  The establishment of the new <B>Asset Accumulator Account</B> demonstrates TD's ability to grow with its customers.</P>

<P>TD Asset Management Inc. (TDAM) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Toronto Dominion Bank.  TDAM currently manages over $10 billion for mutual funds, pension funds, corporations, institutions, endowments, foundations and high net worth individuals.</P>

<h3>TD BANK RANKS #1 IN MUTUAL FUND INDUSTRY RESEARCH SURVEY</h3>







<P>TORONTO - Toronto Dominion Bank has been ranked #1 in Marketing Solutions'
&quot;Asking for Advice&quot; research survey completed on behalf of 12
major Canadian financial institutions. In light of a recent Deloitte &amp;
Touche Mutual Funds Survey confirming that the majority of Canadians surveyed
consider banks preferred distributors of mutual funds, the new results firmly
establish TD's leadership in the mutual funds industry.  

<P>TD Asset Management (TDAM) President Mark Wettlaufer said the positive results
are attributable to TDAM's strategy of striving to make their customers
successful investors and continually growing with their needs by providing
superior staff training and development, consumer education and information,
forums for customer feedback and comprehensive financial planning tools.

<P>&quot;It's particularly gratifying to be #1 in every city across Canada,
and to receive the highest rating both on knowledge and providing the most
specific advice of any financial institution surveyed,&quot; Wettlaufer
said.  &quot;The results prove we've successfully built the knowledge level
of TD representatives through our intensive National Review training process.&quot;

<P>TD's National Review has been an innovative, annual cross-Canada employee
education initiative, developed with the support of the University of Toronto,
testing and now demonstrating the expert knowledge and counselling capability
of TDAM's investment specialists.

<P>This authoritative advice capability, complemented by leading-edge financial
planning tools such as TD's Wealth Allocation Model, and backed up by TDAM's
historic mutual fund performance standards, adds up to a winning combination
for Green Line unitholders.

<P>In addition, the continuing series of cross-Canada Unitholder Meetings bringing
senior TD executives face-to-face with investors has also resulted in a
better understanding of TD customer needs coast-to-coast which TDAM plans
to use to service its clients even better in future.

<P>Toronto Dominion Asset Management (TDAM) is a division of Toronto Dominion
Securities Inc. a wholly-owned subsidiary of Toronto Dominion Bank.  TDAM
currently manages almost $8 billion for mutual funds, pension funds, corporations,
institutions, endowments, foundations and high net worth individuals.

<h2>News Release - Communique</h2>

<h3>TD BANK LAUNCHES STORED VALUE CARD PILOT TODAY - A SMART CARD FOR SMALL
PURCHASES</h3>





<P>
TORONTO - The Toronto-Dominion Bank announced today it has teamed up with
<B>Visa Canada Association</B> to launch TD VISA* Cash, a chip-based smart card
developed by Visa for low dollar consumer purchases at retail outlets.  The
stored value card pilot began today in Toronto with 10,000 TD VISA Cash cards
available for purchase by TD employees to use at the TD Centre cafeteria.  The
pilot will be expanded in early 1996 to include a limited number of nearby TD
Centre retailers, such as <B>michel's baguette, mmmarvellous mmmuffins, and The
UCS Group</B>.


<P>The TD VISA Cash card is an alternate to carrying cash and coins for small
purchases and exact change for coin transactions.  Consumers are expected to
find TD VISA Cash to be a fast, convenient and easy way to make day-to-day low
dollar purchases at places that do not traditionally accept credit cards, debit
payments, or cheques.  Such places include fast food outlets, transit systems,
vending machines, newspaper boxes, parking meters, and convenience stores. 
Merchants can expect TD VISA Cash to reduce their cost of handling cash,
vandalism and theft, and to speed up customer transactions.


<P>TD VISA Cash looks like a traditional plastic automated banking machine
(ABM) card, but it has an embedded micro-computer chip that stores a specified
prepaid dollar amount, usually $20 to $40,  in the form of electronic cash.  As
the card is used, the exact amount of the purchase is deducted from the chip
and the terminal displays the amount of value remaining on the card.


<P>TD fully expects consumer demand for TD VISA Cash cards to grow rapidly once
consumers see how easy to use and widely accepted these cards will be. 
"Consumer support for the stored value concept is strong.  Research reveals
that four out of five consumers are eager to use stored value cards to replace
cash for their everyday low dollar purchases," said Ron Hodges, Vice President,
Personal Access Banking.


<P>Canadians rely heavily on their ABM cards to make debit payments and VISA
cards to make credit purchases but they get frustrated when they go to small
retailers and service outlets that don't accept these cards.  With TD VISA
Cash, consumers will be able to use a card at places where only cash or exact
change is currently accepted.  Steve Phillips, TD Smart Card Development
Manager, said "One of the major benefits of stored value cards is that they
complement existing cards and offer consumers a greater range of payment
methods, but with added convenience and ease of use." 


<P>"Consumers will find using a stored value card to be a viable substitute to
using cash for small dollar transactions," continued Phillips.  Consumers will
have the exact change for small value purchases and merchants will be able to
process transactions and service customers quicker.  "Imagine how simple and
convenient it would be if it takes you only a few seconds to pay for small and
frequent purchases such as a newspaper, a chocolate bar or a cup of coffee with
a stored value card when you are in a hurry.  It is much easier and faster to
use than fumbling in your wallet for bills and loose change."  


<P>The storing of electronic value is the first smart card feature TD is
testing.  In this pilot, TD and participating merchants are testing the stored
value feature on a disposable TD VISA Cash card.  A disposable card can not be
used again once the value on the card is used up.   


<P>Another feature of smart cards is the reloading of electronic value onto a
reusable card when value on the card is low.  TD expects the pilot to be
expanded to involve more retail outlets and to test a reloadable TD VISA Cash
card.  Consumers will be able to reload value onto their TD VISA Cash cards by
transferring funds from their bank accounts at locations such as The Green
Machine[TM]. 
 

<P>Other smart card features will likely include the processing of ABM
transactions, credit purchases, debit payments, and other bank account
information.  Eventually TD plans to add these smart card features to existing
Personal Access[TM] cards and TD VISA cards.


<P>In the future TD hopes to offer customers an all-in-one relationship-based
TD smart card.  A relationship-based smart card would be tailored to each
individual's specific financial and personal needs, and may include access to
multiple bank accounts and frequent user loyalty programs.  "We are responding
to customers' needs by utilizing technological innovation to deliver superior
value-added banking services faster, easier and more conveniently," added
Hodges. 


<P>The Toronto-Dominion Bank is a leader in providing flexible and
user-friendly access to its full range of financial services.  Visa has over 18
million VISA cards in circulation in Canada, accounting for 60% of the Canadian
credit card market.

<h3>TD BANK ELIMINATES MORTGAGE RENEWAL FEES</h3>


<P>TORONTO - Effective immediately, Toronto Dominion Bank will eliminate its $85 mortgage renewal
fee for existing TD mortgage customers.  Initially, renewal fees were introduced to offset
processing costs, however, through technological advances, the renewal process can now be
completed with increased cost efficiency.

<P>"Our business is built on the loyalty of our existing customers," says Bruce Shirreff, Senior
Vice President, Mortgages.  "In this competitive environment, we are grateful that our customers
have decided to remain with us.  It is customers' growing acceptance of technology that enables
us to improve the way financial services are delivered."

<P>Customers wanting to renew their TD Mortgage can do so at their branch, via mail or fax, or by
calling TD Bankline at 1-800 465-BANK, or 1-800 89-LIGNE in Quebec. TD Bankline agents can also
provide the name of TD's mobile mortgage managers who make house calls accepting mortgage
pre-qualifications and applications.

<P>"Eliminating the mortgage renewal fee is truly another example of how TD strives to be "Your
Bank. Your Way.," adds Shirreff.

<h3>Release Publication<br>Thursday, November 23, 1995</h3>

<h2>News Release - Communique</h2>

<h3>TD BANK REPORTS RECORD PROFITS OF $794 MILLION FOR 1995 </h3>

<P>TORONTO - Toronto Dominion Bank today announced net income of $226 million or $.72 per common
share for the fourth quarter of 1995, up from $195 million or $.62 per common share in 1994. 
This brought net income for the year to the record level of $794 million or $2.51 per common
share - up by 17% from the level of 1994 -  as the Bank achieved record net interest income and
record other income, while reducing the loan loss provision to $180 million, the lowest level in
over a decade.


<P>TD has also announced an increase of 14 per cent or three cents (3&cent;) per share in its
quarterly dividend, the third dividend increase in the last two years.  A dividend at the rate of
twenty-five cents (25&cent;) per fully paid common share in the capital stock of the Bank has
been declared for the quarter ending January 31, 1996, payable on and after January 31, 1996, to
shareholders of record at the close of business on December 14, 1995.

<P>"This strong performance in a period of modest economic growth reflects exceptional efforts
throughout the Bank, in our traditional businesses as well as in our new ones," said TD's
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Richard M. Thomson and President, A. Charles Baillie.

<P>This has improved return on equity - our key benchmark for the delivery of shareholder value. 
As well, we saw improvements in our Customer Service Index, our most important measure for making
banking easier and more satisfying for our customers.

<P>During the fourth quarter, as TD continued to expand and enhance businesses and services to
meet our customers' needs, we:

<UL>
<LI> appointed TD's first Ombudsman, to improve relationships between the Bank and our small
business customers.
<P>
<LI> gained Tier II investment banking powers in the United States, allowing us to underwrite and
deal in debt and equity securities in U.S. markets.  We acted rapidly on these powers,
establishing a high yield group and recruiting a bond lending and borrowing (repo) team in New
York.
<P>
<LI> extended our trust services to the administration of offshore trusts and estates, with the
establishment of TD Trust (Bermuda) Limited - broadening the portfolio of wealth management
services available to our customers.
<P>
<LI> received approval to open a branch in Bombay, as we continue to broaden our international
presence to support clients in key global markets.
<P>
<LI> launched a new multi-media advertising campaign, with the theme "We're here to help make it
easier" - in keeping with our public promise, "Your Bank.  Your Way."

</UL>

<P>We anticipate modest economic growth in the year ahead, and we aim to outperform the economy
once again - by building on our core strengths and differentiating TD as the integrated bank, the
bank of industry specialization, and the bank that is committed to making it easier for our
customers.


<H3>REVIEW OF OPERATING PERFORMANCE</H3>

<P>For the second successive quarter, Your Bank achieved record earnings as net income in the fourth
quarter of 1995 reached $226 million.  This was an increase of $31 million or 15% over a year
ago, and $1 million over the previous quarter.  The significant improvement from a year ago
resulted primarily from a record level of other income, significantly higher net investment
securities gains and a lower provision for credit losses.

<P>The net income growth from a year ago reflected strong performances in most of the Bank's businesses.  Retail branch banking generated a substantial increase in earnings as did the Bank's United States operations where record earnings were achieved in 1995.  The investment banking business continued to increase its contribution to the Bank's earnings.

<P>Net income per share for the fourth quarter of 1995 was $.72 compared to $.71 for the previous quarter and $.62 a year ago. These improved earnings over the prior year produced increases in the return on assets from .78% to .86% and in the return on common equity from 14.8% to 15.8%.

<P>As a result of the Bank's strong performance throughout 1995, net income reached $794 million or $2.51 per share.

<H3>Net interest income</H3>

<P>Net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis for the quarter was $643 million, virtually the same as a year ago.  The 6% growth in the Bank's average earning assets to $94.9 billion was offset by a 15 basis point decline in the Bank's net interest margin from 2.84% to 2.69%.  This decline resulted from the substantial growth in lower  
yielding securities, the decline in corporate loans offset by growth in lower margin residential mortgages, and a shift in customer preferences from low cost non-term deposits to high cost term deposits.

<P>Similar reasons account for approximately half of the 23 basis points decrease in margin compared to the preceding quarter.  The remainder arose primarily from interest recoveries returning to normal levels compared to the very high level experienced in the previous quarter.

<P>During the quarter, the Bank continued to benefit from the strong  equities markets as it realized net investment securities gains of $26 million compared to $9 million a year ago.

<H3>Credit quality and provision for credit losses</H3>

<P>As expected, the downward trend in net non-accrual loans continued during the quarter with a decline to $704 million from $815 million at the end of the third quarter and 
$727 million at the start of the fiscal year.

<P>Provision for loan losses for the year initially forecast at $240 million at the end of the first quarter was reduced to $200 million in the third quarter and has now been finalized at $180 million, the lowest level in at least a decade.  Losses of $160 million were expensed in the first three quarters resulting in $20 million being included in the fourth quarter results.  Due to the improvement in the credit quality of the Bank's loan portfolio, general reserves were reduced $75 million in 1995 to $159 million.

<H3>Other income</H3>

<P>Other income grew $105 million or 40% over the same quarter last year.  Investment and securities services income grew a substantial 62% or $30 million as a result of the Bank's expansion of its securities businesses and increased activity by the Bank's customers.  Card services income increased $25 million from a year ago when significant account acquisition costs related to the issuance of the TD/GM Visa Card were written off.  Favourable market conditions led to strong growth of 53% from foreign exchange 
and derivative products.  Increased activity by corporate customers in all markets serviced by the Bank contributed to the 11% growth in credit fees.  The $21 million increase in sundry other income arose mainly because of increased net insurance revenue due to a reduction in reserves reflecting favourable claims experience.

<P>Compared to the prior quarter, other income grew 11% due to increased net insurance revenue, foreign exchange revenue, and fees related to underwriting, and mergers and acquisitions activities.

<H3>Non-interest expenses</H3>

<P>Excluding the reversal of $20 million of the restructuring provision in the same quarter a year ago, non-interest expenses for the quarter increased 12%.  Of this increase, 10% was due to the expansion and increased activity of our securities businesses and to performance-related compensation.

<P>The Bank's productivity ratio for the quarter of 62.6% improved from 63.3% a year ago as a result of strong revenue growth.

<H3>Balance sheet</H3>

<P>At October 31, 1995, the Bank's total assets were $108.8 billion, an increase of 9% from a year ago largely due to higher levels of cash resources and securities, together with a 5% increase in our residential mortgage and personal loan portfolio.  Business and government loans and bankers' acceptances remained unchanged from a year ago, but declined $1.2 billion from last quarter as a result of repayments by large corporate borrowers and the decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar compared to the Canadian dollar.

<P>Due primarily to declines in interest rates, the market value of the Bank's debt and equity securities portfolios held for investment and liquidity purposes at 
October 31, 1995 was $40 million below cost, a substantial improvement of $316 million from October 31, 1994.											

<P>The Bank's personal deposits increased $.4 billion or 1% from a year ago, as individuals increased their investments in term deposits.  In addition, individuals continued to 
increase their investment in the 31 mutual funds managed by the Bank which grew 8% compared to a year ago to reach $5.9 billion. Total assets under administration grew over 20% during the year to reach $97.4 billion at year end.

<H4>Capital</H4>

<P>During the quarter, the Bank's common equity experienced significant growth of 
$128 million, primarily through earnings after dividends of $151 million.  This was partly offset by unrealized foreign currency losses of $25 million from translation of investments in the Bank's foreign subsidiaries, as the value of the U.S. dollar compared to the Canadian dollar declined during the quarter.

<P>The Bank's total risk-weighted assets increased 2% during the quarter due to increased holdings of securities.  

<P>With these changes, the Bank's ratio of net common equity to risk-weighted assets remained unchanged at 6.7% from the previous quarter and increased from 6.5% a year ago.

<h3>TD BANK REINFORCES COMMITMENT TO SMALL BUSINESS WITH APPOINTMENT OF SENIOR OFFICER AS OMBUDSMAN</h3>



<P>TORONTO -Richard M. Thomson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of TD Bank, has

appointed A. Douglas King, a Senior Vice President of TD, as the Bank's first Ombudsman.



<P>Mr. King's mandate is to improve relationships between the Bank and its customers by

resolving disputes fairly, and professionally.  His initial focus will be on relations with TD's

small and mid-sized business clients.



<P>"This senior appointment reflects our strong commitment to our customers and to service

enhancement," says Mr. Thomson, who pointed to other important TD initiatives in recent 

years -- including TD's Business Banking Relationship Standards and its Independent Business

Advisory Panel, an alternate dispute resolution process.



<P>Mr. King will operate independently of all business units of the Bank and will report directly

to the Chairman, meeting regularly with TD's senior management.  He will advise them as to

sources and causes of complaints and disputes so that service levels can be improved.



<P>Mr. King joined the Bank in 1965 as a credit officer, serving small business customers at

TD's Queen and Spadina branch.  In his thirty year career with TD, he has held senior positions

in international and domestic banking, as well as in TD's securities business, and the Bank's

inspection division.  His broad banking experience includes postings in New York, Hong Kong, Singapore and London.  Most recently, he was Senior Vice President of TD's Corporate and Investment Banking Group, responsible for Asian strategy.

<h3>COUNSELLING WITH CONFIDENCE: 
TORONTO DOMINION ASSET MANAGEMENT CONTINUES TO LEAD 
THE INVESTMENT INDUSTRY IN EMPLOYEE EDUCATION WITH 
SECOND ANNUAL "NATIONAL REVIEW"
</h3> TORONTO Ont. - Building on last year's innovative cross-Canada mutual fund
education initiative, Toronto Dominion Asset Management (TDAM) will administer an
expanded second annual National Review assessment nationwide on Thursday, October
5th, 1995.  The Review is yet another element of TD's ongoing effort to provide
the best possible investment counsel to its clients.

<P>The National Review is a unique education and review program, developed and
graded by professors at the Faculty of Management of the University of Toronto
and the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education (OISE).  Monitored by
independent proctors, it is designed to test and continually improve upon the
knowledge and service skills of TD's more than 4,500 investment specialists and
senior management.

<P>"The intensity and scope of this training, involving nearly one-quarter of all
TD staff, demonstrates our definite commitment to provide the industry's very
best mutual funds information, education and service and specifically outlines
what we are prepared and able to do for our investors," says Mark Wettlaufer,
President of TDAM.  "The result of the National Review will be to further
strengthen the reputation of TD Asset Management and its representatives when it
comes to client investment counsel."

<P>To better serve the growing needs of TD's clients, the National Review has
been expanded far beyond the knowledge level required by regulators.  The program
covers five key areas: Market Knowledge; Product Knowledge; Compliance; Sales
Practices; and Financial Planning.

<P>"The investment specialists at TD have responded to the challenge of the
National Review with enthusiasm, knowing that to meet the unique investment goals
of clients, they must possess leading-edge expertise," says Ken McCord, TD's
National Review Chairman.

<P>"There has been a dramatic increase in the volume and depth of information
included in this year's TDAM training program," says Professor Eric Kirzner,
Faculty of Management, University of Toronto.  "With the background and
experience of last year's program, TD personnel are well prepared to move to this
next level."

<P>Toronto Dominion Asset Management (TDAM) is a division of Toronto Dominion
Securities Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Toronto-Dominion Bank.  TDAM
currently manages in excess of $8 billion for mutual funds, pension funds,
corporations, institutions, endowments, foundations and high net worth
individuals.

</h3>
TORONTO Ont. - TD Payroll Services, a division of the Toronto Dominion Bank, is

<h3>TD BANK LAUNCHES FIRST ASIAN LANGUAGE FINANCIAL INTERNET SITE
</h3>
TORONTO - In answer to requests from many of its Chinese-speaking customers, Toronto Dominion Bank has introduced a new Asian language component to its highly-acclaimed World Wide Web site (www.tdbank.ca).

<P>&quot;To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to tackle the challenge of delivering information over the Internet in the character-based Chinese language,&quot; said Angeline O, Assistant Manager, Asian Marketing, Financial Services Division.

<P>While TD's Asian site will continue to grow over time, it presently offers essential information and advice pertaining to home ownership and mortgages.  

<P>&quot;Buying a home is one of the most important decisions people make in their lives,&quot; said Angeline O.  &quot;By giving our Chinese customers access to the information they need, in the language they're most comfortable with, they'll have a better understanding of the options available to them and we will be better able to help them make decisions that are right for them.&quot; 

<P>One of the site's key features is the Mortgage Navigator.  This interactive tool asks customers to answer a number of pertinent questions and then, based on their answers, provides guidance on the types of mortgages best suited to their needs.  

<P>The site also answers a variety of frequently-asked questions that are of particular interest to Chinese customers who are either new to this country or planning to immigrate in the near future.  (ie. how to establish a personal credit rating when no credit history is available, or how to prearrange for a mortgage before coming to Canada)

<P>In addition, customers can access a directory of TD's nation-wide branch network of Chinese speaking mortgage specialists dedicated to serving the special needs of the Chinese community.

<P>"<B>TD's Asian Web site</B> exemplifies TD Bank's ongoing commitment to making banking easier for customers through the development and implementation of leading-edge technologies," said Steve Gesner, Associate Vice President, Cash Management Services.

<P>As one of the leading proponents of electronic commerce, TD Bank continues to lead the way toward a future that promises convenient, flexible and secure access to its full range of financial services.

Officially launched today, the TD Block Parent program will be profiled in every TD branch across Canada.  Information on how individuals can become a block parent will be available in each TD branch.

<P>&quot;We're thrilled that TD has come on board with us to help promote our programs and overall safety in Canadian communities,&quot; said Rose Marie Brien, President of Block Parents. &quot;With the help of TD Bank, we hope to raise awareness and recruit more Block Parents as well distribute more public education on child safety.&quot;

<P>TD Banks has 955 branches located in almost every community across Canada.

<P>Application forms on becoming a Block Parent will be available in every TD branch.  In three communities  TD is also testing a concept of Neighbourhood Party theme kits.

<P>For over 25 years, the Block Parent Program has been helping to make our communities safer by encouraging co-operation among citizens, law enforcement agencies, school boards, all levels of governments and supportive businesses and service clubs.

Currently, there are approximately 1,200 Block Parent communities and approximately 350,000 Block Parent homes across the country.

<h3>TD BANK AND CANADIAN HOME INCOME PLAN TEAM UP TO BRING REVERSE MORTGAGES TO MARKET  
</h3>
TORONTO - Toronto Dominion Bank and Canadian Home Income Plan (CHIP) are teaming up to offer reverse mortgages to Canadians in Ontario and British Columbia initially.  TD is the only major bank to offer reverse mortgages and together they plan to expand the program across Canada in the future.   


<P>A reverse mortgage is designed for seniors who have most of their equity in their home.  It allows a tax-free lump sum payment and/or an annuity (regular payments) to be paid to the homeowner with the house used as collateral for the loan.  The principal and interest is paid back out of the senior's estate or from the proceeds of the sale of the home.


<P>Vancouver-based CHIP pioneered the concept in Canada in 1986 and has been expanding rapidly ever since.  Carol Christopherson, Vice President and one of the founders of CHIP, says the exclusive referral relationship with TD will make reverse mortgages a more widely available retirement option.


<P>&quot;With the aging of our population and increased demand on the cash flow of retirees due to greater longevity, more active lifestyles, and the squeeze on government benefits, we believe it is important to have reverse mortgages available to more Canadians,&quot; says Christopherson.				


<P>Bruce Shirreff, Senior Vice President, TD Mortgages says that the subject of reverse mortgages has been discussed in the past but the timing and demographics weren't right until now.  &quot;The over 45 age group will be the fastest growing age group in the next 20 years, requiring special needs and attention.&quot;  


<P>Shirreff says that while reverse mortgages are used to supplement retirement incomes, the largest client group is in the middle to upper income brackets who are using the money for lifestyle enhancement while they are still young and healthy to enjoy life or for tax and estate planning purposes.  


<P>&quot;We like the flexibility and security of the TD - CHIP reverse mortgage.  Clients can sell and move at any time; they can repay the mortgage at any time; they can rent the property or if property prices fall, the amount they owe is capped at the value of the house so the home is never at risk,&quot; says Shirreff.  


<P>Homeowners interested in a reverse mortgage can call 1-800-TD-9-CHIP (1-800-839-2447) for more information.


<P>Introducing new products, like the reverse mortgage, is just another way TD is demonstrating its commitment to be &quot;Your Bank. Your Way&quot;.

<h3>Release Publication<br> Tuesday, August 29, 1995</h3>

<h2>News Release - Communique</h2>

<h3>TD ANNOUNCES THE INTERNET'S MOST COMPREHENSIVE
FINANCIAL INFORMATION CENTRE! 
</h3>
TORONTO Ont. - The Toronto-Dominion Bank today announced significant additions to
its World Wide Web site (www.tdbank.ca), adding a number of new resource centres
to its already popular, award winning lineup ("Interactive Age" magazine, April
24, 1995 -- Omega Performance Corporation, May 1995).  Along with the wealth of
additional information, TD has introduced innovative tools that give customers a
personalized view into its World Wide Web site.  These changes were prompted by
customer requests for more detailed information.

<P>"This is the kind of feedback that's so important to us," said TD's Stephen
Gesner, Associate Vice President, Cash Management Services. "Knowing what our
customers want, we can then provide services that are focused on their particular
needs."

<P>Visitors to TD's Web site will now find five new comprehensive Resource Centres,
each loaded with helpful information on specific topics of financial interest --
from day-to-day money management to long-term investment and estate planning. 
Within these Centres, innovative tools assist individuals in customizing their
visit based on their personal financial needs and goals.

<P>The five Resource Centres are: the Life Planning Centre; the Mutual Fund Centre;
the Credit Card Centre; the Student Essentials Centre, and the Green Line
Investor Services Inc. Centre.

<P>The Life Planning Centre (available on August 31, 1995), sponsored by
TD Trust Company, houses an interactive financial navigation tool that directs
users to pertinent areas of investment information within TD's Web site,
following a personalized evaluation of their current financial plan and their
desires for the future.  The Centre also provides detailed information on all
aspects of effective estate planning including Wills, Powers of Attorney, Trusts
and RRSPs.

<P>The Mutual Fund Centre, sponsored by TD Asset Management, a division of Toronto
Dominion Securities Inc., utilizes TD's exclusive Wealth Allocation Model to
recommend a diversification strategy based on an individual's investment needs. 
Also available are daily fund prices, complete "Fund Profiles", the library of
"Investment Bulletins and Update", and the TD Mutual Funds quarterly newsletter.

<P>The Credit Card Centre, sponsored by TD Visa, features the Credit Card
Consultant, a tool which helps customers choose the TD Visa Credit card that best
suits their needs.  The Centre also offers helpful tips on achieving and
maintaining a healthy credit card rating; gives advice on how to best protect
credit cards from being lost, stolen or abused; provides a detailed look at the
various kinds of TD Visa credit cards available, and even provides credit card
application forms.

<P>The Student Essentials Centre (available on August 30, 1995) is designed to
provide students enrolled in university or community college with information on
how to get the most out of a banking relationship.  It includes frequently asked
questions on what to ask when choosing an account and service plan such as the TD
Student Plan.  As this is often the first time students have to "balance the
books", the Centre includes a student budget which can be downloaded to help keep
track of day-to-day expenses.  Financing a post-secondary education can be a
challenge so we have provided details on our newest product, the TD Student Line.
 This line of credit can be used to help cover the cost of such items as tuition,
books, a computer and living expenses. 

<P>The Green Line Investor
Services Inc. Centre contains a unique Equities Commissions' Calculator that
allows customers to quickly determine the savings that can be realized by using
Green Line's industry leading brokerage services.  Also, prospective clients can
download a demonstration of the award winning (the Society for Canadian Office
Automation Professionals, Award of Excellence for Innovative Use of Information
Technology, awarded at the Comtech '95 Show) Green Line MicroMax software that
demonstrates many features and benefits Green Line clients enjoy through the
convenience of their own home or office PC.  And if a visitor wants to learn more
about investing, they can find a listing of Green Line investment seminars in
their area.

<P>The Life Planning Centre, Mutual Fund Centre, Credit Card Centre, Student
Essentials Centre and Green Line Investor Services Inc. Centre, exemplify TD
Bank's ongoing commitment to making banking easier for customers through the
development and implementation of leading-edge technologies.  "We've got several
other additions planned over the next few weeks which will further illustrate our
commitment to this new medium," added Gesner.  A new Economic Report and a new
section for Student Services will also be available.

<P>In addition to the new Resource Centres, TD has added a search facility to help
visitors quickly locate topics of interest on its expansive site, and reorganized
some of the existing site, in response to customer requests.

<P>As one of the leading proponents of electronic commerce, TD Bank continues to
lead the way toward a future that promises convenient, flexible and secure access
to its full range of financial services.

<h2>News Release - Communique</h2>

<h3>TORONTO DOMINION REPORTS THIRD QUARTER EARNINGS OF $225 MILLION</h3>

<P>TORONTO - Toronto Dominion Bank today reported third quarter earnings reaching record levels at $225 million or $.71 per common share, up 42% per share from the third quarter of 1994.  This earnings growth reflected strong performances throughout the Bank, and improving credit conditions, which led to increased interest recoveries, higher credit fees and lower loan losses. 

<P>Non-accrual loans resumed a downward trend as large recoveries and repayments more than offset a major addition during the quarter.  We expect this improvement to continue, and we have revised our loan loss estimate for the year to $200 million, a reduction of $40 million.  We charged $40 million of the loss estimate to the third quarter, compared to $60 million in each of the first two quarters of 1995, and $88 million in the third quarter of 1994.

<P>"We are pleased to report that the improvements in TD's financial performance were widespread -- extending through our retail banking, business banking, corporate and investment banking in Canada and the United States, brokerage, trust, mutual fund and VISA businesses," said TD's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Richard M. Thomson and President, A. Charles Baillie. 

<P>Highlights of activities during the quarter include:

<H3><LI>Investment banking momentum - in Canada and the U.S.A.</H3>

<P>Our investment banking businesses continued to show momentum through the quarter as our asset securitization group became a leader in the Canadian market, our institutional sales, trading and research business grew rapidly, our new merchant banking unit made an exceptionally strong start, and our fixed income trading and sales operation was significantly expanded in Toronto and London, England.  Just after quarter end, we received regulatory approval to expand Toronto Dominion Securities (USA) Inc. to underwrite and deal in debt and equity securities in the United States.  Our initial U.S.A. focus will be on high yield public debt products in sectors where TD has established a strong corporate banking presence -- communications and media, forest products and health care.

<H3><LI>Green Line Investor Services Inc. enters the U.S.A.</H3>

<P>Green Line - Canada's market leading discount broker - opened a subsidiary in the United States during the quarter to offer a full range of products and services with particular emphasis on prompt access to the Canadian market and dual currency accounts.  Currently registered in New York, Green Line Investor Services (U.S.A.) Inc. plans to expand sales to all 50 states.  

<H3><LI>Mutual fund performance improvement</H3>

<P>Our Green Line Family of No-Load Mutual Funds showed solid growth during the quarter, reflecting strong fund performance. Of particular note was our Science and Technology Fund which topped <I>The Globe and Mail</I> one year performance category each month during the period.

<H3><LI>"Mainstreet"  banking for small and mid sized businesses </H3>

<P>To build further on the substantial growth we have achieved in our loans to small and mid-sized businesses -- and to enhance service to customers -- we are expanding delivery of Business Banking Services through our branch network.  Our goal is to make business credit and banking services available through all our 960 branches in Canada, up from 400 at the beginning of the year.  Since March, we have extended this service to 275 branches, bringing the total to 675. 

<H3><LI>"Your Bank. Your Way." through satellite banking in the Yukon</H3>

<P>Improving access to banking services is fundamental to achieving our vision of making TD "Your Bank. Your Way." for every customer, and we moved forward in the development of convenient electronic services during the quarter with the launching of satellite banking in Old Crow, a remote community north of the Arctic Circle in the Yukon.  In a community without telephone land-lines, residents now have access to electronic branch banking.

<H3><LI>Advancement of women</H3>

<P>As we work to be a leader for shareholders and for customers, we are also committed to being a leading employer.  We are therefore taking immediate action on the recommendations of TD's Task Force for the Advancement of Women to enhance opportunities for women and improve workplace practices for all employees of the Bank. We have appointed a senior officer to oversee the process, and we will report on progress on a regular basis.

<P>While the economic climate and consumer confidence in Canada remain uncertain, we expect economic growth to continue into 1996, and we believe TD is well positioned to build further on the strong performance seen in the third quarter.

<H2>Review of operating performance</H2>

<P>Your Bank achieved record level earnings in the third quarter of 1995 of $225 million.  Net income increased $63 million or 39% over a year ago and $61 million from the previous quarter.  These strong results were primarily generated by record other income and an improvement in the quality of the Bank's loan portfolio which led to a lower provision for credit losses and significantly higher interest recoveries.

<P>Net income per share for the third quarter of 1995 at $.71 was substantially higher than the $.52 earned in the previous quarter and the $.50 reported last year.  These improved earnings from a year ago produced increases in the return on assets to .85% from .66% and in the return on common equity to 16.0% from 12.3%.

<P>As a result of the Bank's performance in the first nine months of 1995, net income increased to $568 million or $1.79 per share from prior year's $488 million or $1.52 per share despite the $22 million after-tax acquisition costs of Lancaster Financial Holdings Inc.

<H3>Net interest income</H3>

<P>Net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis increased $55 million to $692 million from a year ago.  This increase was generated by a 7% growth in the Bank's average earning assets to $94.0 billion, and a 5 basis point improvement in the Bank's net interest margin - the first year over year margin increase since the first quarter 1994.  The margin improvement to 2.92% was attributable to high interest recoveries totalling over $45 million compared to $9 million a year ago.  

<P>Compared to the preceding quarter, the Bank's margin rose 15 basis points as a result of a $33 million increase in interest recoveries and a decline in market interest rates.  Branch banking margins remained stable.

<P>During the quarter, the equities markets in North America continued to be robust, enabling the Bank to realize $21 million in net investment securities gains compared to $2 million a year ago.

<H3>Credit quality and provision for credit losses</H3>

<P>Due to the improvement in the financial condition of several large corporate borrowers and despite a major addition during the quarter, non-accrual loans declined $129 million to $815 million at July 31, 1995.  We expect this improvement to continue, and we have revised our loan loss estimate for the year to $200 million, a reduction of $40 million.  We charged $40 million of the loss estimate to the third quarter, compared to $60 million in each of the first two quarters of 1995, and $88 million in the third quarter of 1994.

<H3>Other income</H3>

<P>Other income for the quarter of $330 million was a record.  Compared to the same quarter a year ago, increases in all categories were experienced except for revenues from foreign exchange and derivative products which were slightly lower than a year ago, but the highest in four consecutive quarters.  Revenue from service charges grew as the number of accounts and activity by our customers increased.  Your Bank in both Canada and the United States generated a significant increase in corporate credit fees.  

<P>Increased market activity by our customers and expansion of the operations of TD Evergreen Investment Services Inc., the Bank's full service broker, led to strong growth in revenue from investment and securities services.  Card services income increased, reflecting continued growth in usage of the TD/GM Visa Card and the inclusion in the 1994 results of significant start-up costs.

<H3>Non-interest expenses</H3>

<P>Non-interest expenses for the quarter increased 10% over the same period a year ago.    Of this increase, 7% was due to the expansion of our securities businesses and performance related compensation.

<P>As the growth rate of the Bank's total revenues exceeded that for expenses, the Bank's productivity ratio for the quarter improved to 58.4% from 60.4% in the third quarter 1994 and 59.9% in the previous quarter.

<H3>Balance Sheet</H3>

<P>At July 31, 1995, the Bank's total assets were $104.9 billion, an increase of 7% from a year ago largely due to higher levels of trading securities together with a 5% increase in our residential mortgage and personal loan portfolio.  Business and government loans and bankers' acceptances remained unchanged from a year ago, but declined $2.0 billion from last quarter as a result of repayments by large corporate borrowers.

<P>The market value of the Bank's debt and equity securities portfolios held for investment and liquidity purposes at July 31, 1995 was $109 million below cost, an improvement of $247 million from October 31, 1994.  The improvement in the market value of the debt portfolio resulted from the continuing decline in market interest rates during the quarter that increased the value of our Canadian and U.S. government bonds which have an effective average remaining term to maturity of 1.5 years.

<P>The Bank's personal deposits increased $1.0 billion or 2% from a year ago, as individuals increased their investments in term deposits.  Compared to a year ago, the mutual funds managed by the Bank increased 3% to reach $5.7 billion, as an increase of 10% during the quarter more than offset decreases in prior quarters in 1995.

<H3>Capital</H3>

<P>During the quarter, the Bank's common equity experienced significant growth of $159 million, primarily through increased earnings after dividends of $149 million.

<P>As a result of this growth, the Bank's ratio of net common equity to risk-weighted assets increased to 6.7% from 6.3% a year ago and 6.4% the previous quarter.

<h3>Release Publication<br> Wednesday, August 23, 1995</h3>

<h2>News Release - Communique</h2>

<h3>EFFORTS TO REDUCE PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT DEFICITS PAYING OFF,
SAY TD ECONOMISTS
</h3>

<P>TORONTO - "In contrast to the early 1990's, when most provincial governments recorded widening deficits and missed deficit targets, the majority of the provinces are now succeeding in their deficit-reduction efforts," said Teresa Chandler, Senior Economist, TD Bank.  Two provinces balanced their budgets in fiscal 1994-95, and the tally is expected to rise to six this year.  Expenditure restraint remained a dominant theme of provincial budgets across the country, and most provincial governments refrained from increasing major tax rates in their 1995 budgets.

<P>For the first time since 1990, two provinces -- Saskatchewan and Alberta -- balanced their budgets in fiscal 1994-95.  Six provinces -- British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland -- pledged to record surpluses in the current fiscal year.  Three provinces --Alberta, Manitoba and New Brunswick -- have proposed or already passed balanced-budget/debt-reduction legislation which formalizes their commitment to balancing the consolidated budget and reducing debt over the medium term. 

<P>"The combined federal and provincial debt will reach $826 billion this fiscal year, representing 106 per cent of GDP, or about $28,000 per person," said Ms. Chandler.  Assuming that the federal and provincial governments' fiscal targets are met, the combined federal and provincial debt-to-GDP ratio is forecast to edge down gradually starting in fiscal 1996-97.

<P>Canada's debt relative to GDP is currently the second-highest among the G-7 countries, behind only Italy.  As Canadian government debt mounted during the past decade, a large proportion of this debt was purchased by non-residents.  Canada now has by far the highest net foreign indebtedness as a share of GDP of any G-7 country.

<P>The fact that a substantial proportion of government debt is held by foreign investors increases the vulnerability of Canadian government finances, and the Canadian economy as a whole, to the vagaries of international financial markets.  "Pressure from international financial markets will be alleviated only when Canada's federal and provincial governments succeed in achieving a substantial reduction in Canada's total government debt burden," said Ms. Chandler.

<P>Although provincial governments are at different stages on the path to reducing deficits and debt, they will face similar challenges in the years ahead.  All provinces will have to cope with reductions in federal-provincial transfers starting in fiscal 1996-97.  Governments will continue to face the risks of weaker-than-anticipated economic growth or higher-than-expected interest rates.  Provinces which have already balanced their budgets and set a clear plan for meeting their fiscal targets will be better prepared than provinces which are still struggling with deficit elimination.  Over the near term, it will be particularly important for Ontario and Quebec -- the two provinces which currently have the highest relative deficits -- to adopt prudent revenue forecasts as well as to provide regular updates of their fiscal progress.

<P>The TD Bank is pleased to announce that this report is now available at TD's Economic Research Library on the Internet. Visit TD's award-winning Internet site at: http://www.tdbank.ca.

<h3>THE TORONTO-DOMINION BANK ANNOUNCES REDEMPTION OF 
$125 MILLION 11.65 PER CENT DEBENTURES
</h3>


<p>TORONTO - The Toronto-Dominion Bank announced today it is calling for
redemption of its outstanding $125 Million 11.65 per cent Debentures due
September 19, 2000.  The issue will become due and payable on September
19, 1995 at a redemption price of 100 per cent of the principal amount. 
The debentures were originally issued in September 1990. 

<p>Mr. Robert P. Kelly, Executive Vice President, Finance, explained that, "the
11.65 per cent Debentures represent very expensive Tier II capital by
today's standards.  Redemption of the Debentures is cost effective and
will have no effect on the Bank's strong Tier 1 capital ratio while the
Bank's total capital ratio will remain strong at just below 10 per cent."

<h3>Release Publication<br> Thursday, August 3, 1995</h3>

<h2>News Release - Communique</h2>

<h3>CANADA'S ECONOMIC EXPANSION WILL RESUME IN THE SECOND
HALF OF 1995, SAY TD ECONOMISTS
</h3>


<p>TORONTO - Canada's economic performance will improve significantly in
the second half of 1995, according to economists at Toronto Dominion
Bank in the July 1995 issue of the semi-annual publication, Canada's
Business Climate.


<P>In the first half of this year, the pace of economic growth in Canada
slowed abruptly.  The surge in Canadian interest rates in late 1994 and
early 1995 damaged consumer confidence and spending power, and the
pause in U.S. economic activity dampened Canadian export growth. 
However, the conditions for a stronger second half are falling into place.


<P>There are signs that the U.S. economy is already emerging from the
doldrums, which will benefit Canadian exports, and the decline in Canadian
interest rates in the second quarter of this year will encourage a modest
revival in consumer spending and residential construction activity.  "There
are still some inventory adjustments to be made in the near term," says
Anna Guthrie, Senior Economist, "but by the end of the year, the Canadian
economy should be growing at a rate of close to 3 per cent."

<P>Guthrie cautions against expecting a return to the 4.5 per cent plus growth
rate of 1994.  "The U.S. economic expansion is now middle-aged, with a
rate of growth not strong enough to keep Canadian exports rising at
double-digit rates."  At the same time, Canadian consumers, who account
for almost 60 per cent of economic activity, remain heavily 
indebted, vulnerable to jumps in interest rates, and hence unlikely to
indulge in a spending boom. 

<P>After a skimpy 2 per cent rise in real gross domestic product (GDP) in
1995, TD economists look for economic growth to accelerate to around 2.5
per cent in 1996-97.  With employment rising by a little less than 1.5 per
cent per year, the unemployment rate will hover around 9.6 per cent for
the next two years.  Interest rates should decline very gradually from
their second-quarter 1995 levels, given that some slack will remain in
the Canadian economy and the rate of inflation will stay close to the Bank
of Canada's target of 2 per cent.  However, there are risks of temporary
jumps in rates if international investors again become concerned about
government deficits or the Quebec referendum.  Another surge in interest
rates, like the one last winter, would jeopardize the rebound in economic
activity.

<h3>TD BANK TESTING SECURE TRANSACTIONS OVER THE INTERNET
</h3>


<p>TORONTO - In a presentation to the Marketing Advisory Council's Internet
Conference on July 31, 1995 in Toronto, Ontario, TD Bank's Stephen Gesner,
Associate Vice-President, Cash Management Services, announced the Bank's testing
of secure transactions over the Internet.


<P>TD Bank, who has lead the way in pioneering the advancement of electronic
commerce with an extensive presence on the Internet through its World Wide Web
site, is responding to consumers' requests for transactional capabilities over the
Internet.


<P>"We firmly believe that secure transaction is the next vital step in our
efforts to make banking as easy as possible for customers," said Mr. Gesner. 
"Customers not only want and need the assurance of absolute security, they also
expect it.  It's our responsibility at TD to deliver it to them."

<P>To achieve this critical goal, TD Bank has teamed up with computer manufacturer
Tandem Computers, secure transaction specialists Open Market Inc., and interactive
marketing agency Quadravision Communications.  The result of their collective
expertise will be a full range of secure banking services, all of which will be
available to customers quickly and easily through TD's award-winning Web site.

<P>The group is now focused on the process of extensive testing.  According to Mr.
Gesner, the new service will be launched when, and only when, TD Bank is 100%
certain that its customers are protected with the highest level of security
possible.

<P>"At this point we're extremely pleased with what we have accomplished," said
Mr. Gesner.  "We believe the concept of secure Internet banking for our customers
will very soon be a reality."

<P>TD's Internet secure transaction initiative is further evidence of TD Bank's
ongoing commitment to making banking easier for customers through the development
and implementation of leading-edge technologies.

<P>As one of the world's foremost proponents of electronic commerce, TD Bank
continues to lead the way toward a future that promises convenient, flexible and
secure access to its full range of financial services - from information to
transactions - from any place, at any time.

<h3>TD's MERCHANT BANKING GROUP ANNOUNCES $20 MILLION INVESTMENT IN COM DEV
INTERNATIONAL
</h3>
<h4>COM DEV to expand efforts in wireless, PCS markets</h4>


<p>TORONTO - Toronto Dominion Merchant Bank today announced that it has made a $20 million subordinated
debenture investment in COM DEV International Inc., a leading space satellite
hardware and telecommunications company.  This investment will enable COM DEV to
expand aggressively into the wireless and Personal Communication System market.

<P>"We are very pleased by TD's vote of confidence in our future," said Val
O'Donovan, COM DEV's founder, Chairman and CEO.  "This investment provides COM
DEV with the resources we need to pursue the many additional outstanding
expansion opportunities now available, both at home and abroad."

<P>Toronto Dominion Merchant Banking Group is among Canada's oldest and largest
merchant banks.  Formed in 1967, the group currently has committed capital of
$300 million and a portfolio consisting of over 30 companies.

<P>"Our objective in this business is to achieve superior long term capital growth,
by investing in exceptional companies and management teams," said Charlie
Baillie, President, TD Bank.

<P>"COM DEV fit our new focus and mandate perfectly," said John MacIntyre, who
manages the Merchant Bank.  We recognized that in order for COM DEV to undertake
new business initiatives, the company needed to increase its capital base over
and above the cash flow generated by core operations.  It's a good demonstration
of the Merchant Banks' ability to find and act on outstanding opportunities."
said MacIntyre.

<P>COM DEV will use the TD Bank financing to expand its investment in the wireless
communications market through its alliances and joint ventures with Phase Devices
Ltd. of the United Kingdom and Research in Motion (RIM) of Waterloo.  Both
companies are emerging leaders in the PCS and wireless data communications
industry.

<P>COM DEV, with annual revenues around $75 million, has been profitable in every
year since its incorporation in 1974.  Its growth has averaged 20 per cent per
year over the past 15 years.

<h3>Release Publication<br> Monday, July 10, 1995</h3>

<h2>News Release - Communique</h2>

<h3>TD BANK LAUNCHES SATELLITE BANKING
</h3>


<p>TORONTO -  TD Bank today launched satellite banking in the Yukon town of
Old Crow.  Old Crow is north of the Arctic Circle and cannot be reached by
road.  The town can be accessed only via air or, via water in the Summer
months.  Nor does Old Crow have telephone land-lines, although satellite
telephone service is available.  Residents will enjoy full service
electronic branch banking through the innovative, partnership approach
taken by TD Bank.
      
<p>"We were excited by the challenge presented by the realities of the
remote communities of the Yukon and couldn't be more pleased to be living
up to our Your Bank. Your Way. commitment," said Jim Hudson, Senior Vice
President, Pacific Division.

<p>In addition to Old Crow, TD Bank is providing services to the Yukon
communities of Faro, Beaver Creek and Whitehorse.

<H3>The Partnership Approach</H3>

<p>TD Bank worked closely with the Yukon Territorial Government and the
remote communities in the Yukon to provide the infrastructure and
expertise needed to supply residents with basic banking services that
have been widely available to Canadians for a number of years.  

<p>By working as partners in this enterprise, all parties were able to realize
significant benefits: communities are able to access banking services
normally available through branches even though they live in areas where
branches are either not viable or simply not possible; the Bank is able to
serve its customers and potentially gain new customers; and the Yukon
Territorial Government is able to enhance service to its citizens.

<p>Many residents of remote Yukon communities are Aboriginal Peoples.  TD
Bank worked closely with the residents and with TD's Aboriginal Peoples'
Banking Group to meet their needs and to ensure community residents
acting as TD's agents in providing services were equipped to do the same.

<H3>Electronic Solutions</H3>

<p>Partnering with agents in remote communities and providing them with
the technology to supply real time banking services distinguishes the TD
approach.  Residents are able to use the TD personal access card to ensure
that deposits with TD are credited on a same-day basis; withdrawals can
also be completed in real time through Interac. Residents can also use
debit services with many merchants; and satellite telephone banking and
preauthorized payments to handle bills. These services are helping to
address historical, chronic cash shortage problems. Many services either
have not been available or were underutilised until now.  

<p>"Working together with our partners in bringing all the elements together
to make this happen is a real Canadian success story and one we are
committed to repeating," said Hudson.

<h2>News Release - Communique</h2>

<h3>TD BANK PAYS UP TO $2,500 CASH BACK ON MORTGAGES
</h3>


<p>TORONTO -  To capitalize on signs of increased housing market activity, TD Bank
is  offering customers up to $2,500 cash for each new mortgage, from now until 
August 31, 1995.


<p>To receive the cash (up to 1% of the mortgage principal amount to a maximum of
$2,500) all new TD mortgage customers and customers who transfer their mortgage
from other financial institutions must agree to keep the mortgage at TD for six
years.  The cash is payable when the mortgage funds are advanced.


<p>
"We want the opportunity to build a relationship with these customers," said Bruce
Shirreff, Senior Vice President, Mortgages.  "You can't build a strong customers
relationship without a solid foundation, so, rather than restrict the cash offer
to those who choose closed fixed terms, customers can choose any mortgage term
they want during those six years - even six month and one year open terms."


<p>For customer convenience, TD mortgages can be arranged over the telephone by
calling 1-800-465-BANK (2265), in Toronto 982-BANK (2265), or for service in
French 1-800-89-LIGNE (895-4463).


<p>TD's "Up to $2,500 cash back" is available at all branches until August 31,
1995.

<h2>News Release - Communique</h2>

<h3>TD CUSTOMERS TO GET LOWER FEES, SIMPLER BANKING	
</h3>


<p>TORONTO - Customers of TD Bank can expect as much as a 29% reduction in some
service fees and simpler ways to access and manage their money starting September 1,
1995 when the bank launches a more competitive product line-up for savings and
chequing account customers, Toronto Dominion Bank announced today.

<p>TD is streamlining its existing line-up of Personal Deposit Accounts and beefing-up its
Service Plan benefits to make it simpler for customers to choose the account or service
plan that's best for them and more straight forward by standardizing many transaction
fees and service charges.

<p>"Our customers have been telling us that for TD Bank to truly be 'Your Bank. Your
Way.' &reg; we need to offer an easy-to-understand line-up of products that helps them
access their money the way they want to, and get the most out of their relationship with
TD," said Christine Thompson, Vice President, Financial Services Division.  "With our
revised line-up, we haven't given our customers more choices, we've given them better
choices."

<p>Among the changes customers will see:
<br><h3>Savings Accounts</h3>
<ul>
<li>one lower self-service fee (reduced by as much as 29% to $0.85)
<li>one lower in-branch fee (reduced by as much as 28% to $1.00)
</ul>
<h3>Chequing Accounts</h3>
<ul>
<li>one lower self-service fee (reduced by 11% to $0.40)
<li>one lower in-branch fee for U.S. Daily Interest Chequing Account (reduced by
7% to US$0.60)
<li>one no-charge level for self-service banking (raised from a balance of $700 to
$1,000)
<li>one no-charge level for monthly maintenance fees (reduced in most cases by
$450 to a standardized balance of $250)
</ul>

<p>TD customers will be notified of their new choices through statement stuffers and
materials in-branch and at Green Machines beginning July 1.

<p>The majority of TD's savings and chequing account customers will either see no change
in their monthly fees or will benefit from lower fees with the new structure. TD will assist
customers in finding the best account and service plan for their needs.

<h3>TD PRESIDENT COMMITS TO ENHANCED OPPORTUNITIES FOR WOMEN AT TD, APPOINTS
SENIOR OFFICER WITH MANDATE FOR CHANGE

</h3>


<p>TORONTO - TD President A. Charles Baillie has released the report of the
Task Force for the Advancement of Women at TD, with a commitment to
act on recommendations to improve workplace practices.  

<p>He has appointed a senior officer of the Bank -- Mary Hatch, Vice
President & Manager, Toronto Division -- as Chair of a new Steering
Committee on the Advancement of Women.  While continuing to lead TD's
St. Clair Centre Commercial Banking Centre, which she has managed since
March 1993, Hatch will oversee the process of enhancing opportunities for
women, acting on the President's mandate for change.

<p>"We will be a better bank when we break down barriers to women's
advancement and enhance career opportunities," Baillie said.  "I am
committed to making the changes we need to make -- starting now."

<p>Baillie declared a mandate for change after reviewing the Task Force
Report, which was based on the findings of a study conducted by Catalyst,
a consulting group which is a North American leader in effecting change
for women through research and advisory services.  The Catalyst study
identified four key areas where practices and attitudes have put obstacles
in the path of women at the bank:  professional advancement, perceptions
of gender bias, the work/life balance, and the general work environment.  Baillie
has asked Hatch to focus on these four areas as she oversees the process of
change, and he has pledged to report on progress within a year.

<p>"We want TD to be a leader in the advancement of women," Baillie
concluded.  "It's important for our business, and for all employees."

<h3>TD BANK INTRODUCES "TD STUDENT LINE" - FINANCING FOR
STUDENTS
</h3>


<p>TORONTO - Toronto Dominion Bank is pleased to announce the introduction of TD
Student Line, a new loan program to assist students attending universities and
community colleges in financing their education. TD Student Line allows full time
students to borrow up to $5,500 per year, part time students up to $2,750 per
year, to a maximum of $22,000 and $11,000 per student, respectively. 

<p>TD has elected not to participate in the Federal Government's new student loan
program, and will be providing more comprehensive assistance to those students
who either do not qualify for the maximum amount available, or require additional
funding over and above what is obtained under the new Canada Student Financial
Assistance Act.

<p>"We have taken a close look at the overall financial needs of students and
created a comprehensive package that combines flexible financing with a number of
other services," said Stephen Stewart, Vice President, Personal Lending.

<p>TD Student Line allows students to benefit from additional features not offered
by any other financial institution, such as:

<ul>
<li>Student Plan - a service plan for students at half the regular fee, featuring a
unique bank card, unlimited Green Machine transactions, two free cheques, two
free INTERAC transactions, and free Bankline, TD's telephone banking service.
<p>
<li>Overdraft Protection - $500 automatically provided on a students' Moneybuilder
account, with the normal $1.10 per month fee waived while the student is in
school.
<p>
<li>As well as receiving a 12 month interest only grace period following a student's
end of studies, repayment of principal will be structured with ultimate
flexibility. As long as principal reductions are being made, there will be no
maximum period specified for repayment in full. This allows the student to
tailor his/her payments in accordance with his/her income level following
graduation. 
<p>
<li>Students who do not meet debt service criteria, will require a co-signor. 
However, once 50% of the original principal amount is repaid, TD will release the
co- signor from his/her obligation.
<p>
<li>Students who handle their finances in a responsible manner will also be eligible
for preferred pricing on other loan products they may require in future:
mortgages, auto loans, renovation loans, etc.
<p>
<li>Students pursuing postgraduate studies qualify for an additional two years of
funding, resulting in total credit available of $33,000 for six years of study.
<p>
<li>TD will provide a toll-free 1-800 number for information on the program and how
students can apply.
<p>
<li>Applicants can apply for TD's GM Visa or Green Visa, which can contribute to a
positive credit rating as well as supplement the student's available credit
during his/her course of studies.
</ul>

<p>In addition, TD will offer each student personal financial counselling to ensure
they are aware of common situations that may arise. "There is a common thread to
the financial opportunities and difficulties students encounter," said Stewart. 
"TD is there to provide advice and help students plan for these circumstances and
minimize their costs."

<p>Interest on TD Student Line will be set monthly at the low rate of Prime +1%. 
Interest will be charged monthly, however only on the average balance owing over
the previous month. This means that the student can better manage his/her
borrowing costs by drawing on the line only as funds are required.

<p>TD Student Line, initially available in late July, 1995, can be obtained at any
time of the year and offers a variety of convenient ways to access the line of
credit at no charge: via more than 1,900 Green Machines/Fast Cash Machines across
Canada, by no-charge chequing, or through in-branch withdrawals. Free Bankline
as part of Student Plan means the student can make account enquiries, transfers
and bill payments 24 hours a day.

<h3>Release Publication<br> Monday, June 5, 1995</h3>

<h2>News Release - Communique</h2>

<h3> TORONTO DOMINION BANK INTRODUCES U.S. BUSINESS BANKING SERVICES 
</h3>


<p>TORONTO -Toronto Dominion Bank today announced the introduction of
its U.S. Business Banking Service, a combination of account, loan and cash
management services available through TD's US-based branch in New York. 
A key benefit of this service is the ability of each TD Relationship
Manager to support the Canadian and U.S. banking requirements of their
customers throughout North America.

<p>The initial core service will include business accounts, lending services
and electronic balance reporting services.  Additional cash management
services such as Funds Transfer, Controlled Disbursement and Wholesale
Lockbox will be introduced over the next several months.  To augment
these services, customers will continue to access TD's extensive network
of correspondent banks to address their local banking requirements.

<p>Customer feedback indicated that one of the biggest hurdles TD customers
faced south of the border was the time consuming process of familiarizing
a new bank and account manager with their business.  In line with TD's
"Your Bank. Your Way." mission statement, this service is designed to help
customers over that hurdle.

<p>"Banking is a unique mix of people and technology," says Steve Gesner,
Associate Vice President, Cash Management Services.  "By enhancing our
Canadian and U.S.-based technology, we can provide our customers with a
comprehensive and seamless solution to their North American banking
needs delivered through their current Relationship Manager."

<p>Remote access to U.S. Business Banking will be provided through Business
Window, TD's electronic gateway to PC-based products and services. 
Business Window currently provides access to a variety of Payment,
Collection and Information Services to over 8000 customers throughout
the world.

<h3> TD BANK BRINGS "WOMEN IN THE KNOW" ACROSS CANADA IN JUNE
'95
</h3>


<p>TORONTO - Following the success of the initial 22 nationwide <A HREF="#q1">"Women in
the Know"</A> seminars, TD Bank has organized additional seminars through
June to meet the growing demand from TD branches across Canada.

<P> "The response has been overwhelming to the first series of national
forums, and as a result we are increasing our ability to meet the needs of
our female clients," said Janice Book, Managing Director, Toronto Dominion
Asset Management.  "We will continue to provide women with a financial
framework that helps ensure they make the right decisions in keeping
with their unique situations."

<P> The one-hour "Women in the Know" seminars address the fundamentals of
investment planning and wealth management.  Each presentation opens
with a historical look at women's investment traits and the social trends
affecting their investment patterns.  A three-part strategy de-mystifies
the language of investing, describes the tools necessary to assess each
participant's financial status, and concludes with a step-by-step
investment assessment of each client's situation.

<P> "Women are taking greater responsibility for the management of both
personal and family finances as well as investments.  For many reasons --
greater wealth as a result of a stronger presence in the workforce, better
education, rising rates of divorce, and single parenthood -- women today
require more up-to-date and pertinent information about money
management," said Ms. Book.

<P> All "Women in the Know" leaders have received extensive training and are
uniquely attuned to the special circumstances and financial needs of
female investors.

<P> "We want our female customers to be at ease and able to deal with any
given situation, particularly if they are seeking financial advice for the
first time," Book said.

<h2>News Release - Communique</h2>

<h3>TORONTO DOMINION REPORTS SECOND QUARTER EARNINGS OF $164 MILLION
</h3>


<p>TORONTO - Toronto Dominion Bank earned $.52 per common share in the
second quarter, a year-over-year increase of 4%, while moving ahead
with strategies to build our investment banking, retail brokerage and
trust businesses.  This increase in earnings was achieved despite the
fact that, consistent with past practice, we expensed the purchase
price of Lancaster Financial Holdings Inc.- acquired during the
quarter at a cost equivalent to $.07 per share.

<p>"Total revenue reached its highest level since the record first
quarter of 1994, due to a 25 basis point improvement in TD's interest
rate margins from the first quarter of this year, and securities
gains.  Expenses grew by 6%, excluding the Lancaster costs, " said
TD's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Richard M. Thomson and
President, A. Charles Baillie.

<p>Non-accrual loans, while below last year's level, increased from the
first quarter of 1995 - primarily reflecting the impact of the default
by a major property group on its loans; however, we remain optimistic
that non-accruals will resume their downward trend later this year and
our loan loss estimate is unchanged at $240 million for 1995.  We
charged $60 million of the loss estimate to the second quarter - down
by $52 million from the previous year. 

<p>Progress was seen on many fronts at TD during the quarter.  Some of
the highlights include:

<UL>
<LI>Accelerated activity at TD Securities, with the acquisition and
integration of Lancaster Financial Holdings Inc. - boosting our
financial advisory services and mergers and acquisitions capabilities.
Also during the quarter, we established a merchant banking unit, and
added bench strength in other key areas in Toronto, New York and
London.  We were one of the most active dealers during the quarter,
and led a number of issues, including one of the first Canadian dollar
floating rate notes in the domestic market.
<p>
<LI>Strong growth in our loans to small and medium sized businesses.  We
have been working hard to build business in this sector, and during
the quarter we appointed a senior officer of the Bank to accelerate
development of our Business Banking Services for our independent
business customers.
<p>
<li>Continued expansion of TD Evergreen Investment Services Inc., - our
full service retail brokerage - which opened branches in Owen Sound,
Ontario, Courtenay and Kelowna, British Columbia, and Saint John, New
Brunswick.  Evergreen now has over 20 branches and 100 brokers across
Canada, with new branches planned for White Rock, British Columbia,
London and St. Catharines, Ontario, and other important markets.
<p>
<LI>The successful transformation of key branches to TD BANK & TRUST -
improving access to personal trust services for our banking and
investing customers.  During the quarter, TD became the first
financial institution in Canada to combine bank and trust operations
within branches.  We will have redesignated 180 branches across Canada
by the end of 1995, having trained existing branch staff and added
expertise in estate and trust services.  Trust services - which
include will and estate planning, estate and trust account
administration, investment counselling and portfolio management - are
increasingly important to Canada's aging population, and are an ideal
complement to our branches' banking and investment services.
<p>
<LI>Rapid growth in TD Direct Payment - our debit card business, with
cardholder transactions now approaching two million a month.  During
the quarter, we also won significant new merchant accounts with major
retailers, boosting our market share in the retail segment.
<p>
<LI>The development of the TD VISA GOLD TRAVEL CARD (which was publicly
launched on May 23) - the "any way, any place, any time" card,
offering a highly competitive points and rewards program for travel.
</UL>
<p>Many of these developments are providing immediate returns; others
will contribute to results in the future; all are designed to serve
customers better by meeting their changing needs - ensuring that TD
lives up to our promise:  "Your Bank.  Your Way."

<p>As we look ahead during this time of economic uncertainty when
consumer confidence remains fragile, we expect that economic growth
will continue in Canada.  We are encouraged by the decline in interest
rates late in the quarter - and the increasing commitment of
governments in Canada to reduce and eliminate deficits.

<H2>Review of operating performance</H2>

<p>Net income in the second quarter of 1995 was $164 million or $.52 per
common share.  These earnings reflect the $22 million after-tax
acquisition costs for Lancaster Financial Holdings Inc., equivalent to
$.07 per share.  Excluding this item, net income increased $28 million
or 18% over a year ago and $7 million from the previous quarter.  The
improvement from a year ago primarily resulted from a lower provision
for credit losses, and higher securities gains and net interest
income.

<p>On the same basis, net income per share for the second quarter of 1995
at $.59 was higher than the $.56 earned in the previous quarter and
the $.50 reported a year ago.  These improved earnings from a year ago
produced increases in the return on assets from .69% to .73% and in
the return on common equity from 12.7% to 13.9%.

<p>As a result of the Bank's strong performance in the first half of
1995, net income increased despite the acquisition costs of Lancaster
Financial Holdings Inc. to $343 million or $1.08 per share compared to
the prior years first half earnings of $326 million or $1.02 per
share.

<H3>Net interest income</H3>

<p>Net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis increased $18
million to $637 million from a year ago.  This increase was generated
by the 10% growth in the Banks average earning assets to $94.3
million.

<p>The Bank's net interest margin rose during the quarter to 2.77%,
thereby ending four successive quarter-over-quarter decreases.  A 25
basis point improvement over the prior quarter resulted from higher
interest recoveries and improved spreads on personal deposits during a
period of significant increases in interest rates.

<p>During the quarter, the Bank realized $24 million in net investment
securities gains mainly from its operations in the United States
compared to no net gains a year ago.

<H3>Credit quality and provision for credit losses</H3>

<p>Net non-accrual loans increased $180 million from the prior quarter
end to $944 million on April 30, 1995, or 1.2% of total loans and
bankers' acceptances.  The increase arose primarily from loans to one
major real estate group in the United States and Canada.

<p>We continue to be optimistic that non-accrual loans will resume their
downward trend later this year. The loan loss estimate for 1995
remains unchanged from the first quarter estimate of $240 million. 
One quarter of the estimate for 1995, or $60 million, was charged
against income in the second quarter, a decrease of $52 million from a
year ago.

<H3>Other income</H3>

<p>Other income experienced a decline of 8% from a year ago when it
reached a record level primarily due to unusually high revenues from
foreign exchange and derivative products.  Lower market activity by
our customers led to lower investment and securities fees to the Bank
from mutual funds management, underwriting, and brokerage services
provided by Green Line Investor Services Inc.

<p>Favourable developments were the continued strong growth in credit
fees earned throughout the Bank's operations and the increase in card
services income as the usage of the TD/GM Visa Card continued to
grow.

<H3>Non-interest expenses</H3>

<p>Excluding the acquisition costs for Lancaster Financial Holdings Inc.,
non-interest expenses for the quarter increased 6% over the same
period a year ago.  Expenses related to building our securities
businesses, together with increased non-income taxes such as capital
and business taxes and deposit insurance, were the main factors
contributing to this increase. Excluding these factors, expense growth
was approximately 3%.  The Bank is striving to moderate expense
growth.

<p>The Bank is concerned about its increasing tax burden.  Banking is
among the most heavily taxed industries in the country, accounting for
a significant portion of federal and provincial corporate tax revenue. Nevertheless, the federal government targeted the industry for
additional new taxes in its most recent budget.  High taxes are
detrimental to our global competitive position and erode returns to
our shareholders.

<p>The Bank's productivity ratio for the quarter deteriorated to 59.9%
from 57.8% in the second quarter 1994, but improved from 60.4% in the
previous quarter as a result of strong revenue growth.

<H3>Balance Sheet</H3>

<p>At April 30, 1995, the Bank's total assets were $103.7 billion, an
increase of 11% from a year ago largely due to higher levels of
trading securities and loans to all segments.  Business and government
loans and bankers' acceptances have grown 10% as the North American
economy remained strong.

<p>The market value of the Bank's securities portfolios held for
investment and liquidity purposes at April 30, 1995 was $260 million
below cost, compared to $356 million at October 31, 1994.  This
improvement resulted from the decrease in interest rates that
increased the values of our Canadian and U.S. government bonds which
have an average maturity of 1.7 years.

<p>The Bank's personal deposits increased $1.2 billion or 3% from a year
ago, as individuals continued to increase their investments in term
deposits in response to higher interest rates.  This increase was
partly due to an $865 million reduction in mutual funds managed by the
Bank.

<H3>Capital</H3>

<p>During the quarter, the Bank's common equity grew $34 million,
primarily through increased earnings after dividends of $87 million. 
This was partly offset by unrealized foreign currency losses of $56
million from translation of investments in the Bank's foreign
subsidiaries, as the value of the U.S. dollar compared to the Canadian
dollar declined during the quarter. This compares to an unrealized
foreign currency gain of $59 million in the first quarter.

<p>The Bank's ratio of net common equity to risk-weighted assets
remained unchanged at 6.4% from a year ago and the previous quarter.

<h3>Release Publication<br> Tuesday, May 23, 1995</h3> 

<h2>News Release - Communique</h2>

<h3>TD LAUNCHES NEW 'REWARD' CARD WITH NO TRAVEL
RESTRICTIONS
</h3>


  
<p>TORONTO - TD Bank launched a new Visa card today that is the
"most innovative and flexible" travel reward card in Canada," said TD Visa Vice
President, Susan de Stein.

<p>The TD GOLD TRAVEL CARD rewards cardholders with TD Points but
it "goes one better" than anything else on the market.  This is the first credit
card in Canada that places no restrictions on the type of travel reward
available - no more blackout periods, no more seat limitations, no more
carrier and time restrictions.

<p>"With the TD GOLD TRAVEL CARD, cardholders will be able to
travel when they want, where they want and how they want.  That's why we say the
card offers free travel ANY WAY ... ANY PLACE ... ANY TIME," Ms. de Stein
said.

<p>Cardholders earn one point for every dollar spent using the
card but they can earn five TD Points per dollar when they book travel at TD's travel
partner, Carlson Wagonlit Travel.

<p>What's more, cardholders can "top up" TD Points with cash if
they want to travel sooner, before they've saved up the full requirement of points
needed for a free trip.  They can customize their trip according to their
needs or desires, or save time by choosing from a series of "designed"
vacations, including travel and accommodation, which TD will offer in a
bi-monthly newsletter.

<p>The TD GOLD TRAVEL CARD also lets cardholders earn valuable
points in two travel reward programs at the same time and for the same amount of
spending.

<p>"When cardholders book their preferred airline through Carlson
Wagonlit, they earn five bonus TD Points.  They also will earn frequent flyer miles
from that airline if they are a member of the airline's program.  No other
credit card will let you earn points in two programs at the same time.

<p>Our card lets cardholders use the points they have already
saved in the airline programs.  For example, our cardholders can use their airline
points to fly to the port of departure and they can use their TD Points to
take a free cruise.  This is best travel reward program since frequent
flyer points were invented," de Stein said.

<p>TD has set up a special travel redemption centre where
cardholders will call 1-800 number to redeem their TD points and request a reward.

<p>The TD GOLD TRAVEL CARD is competitively priced at $99 annually and by offering additional features and benefits such as auto rental collision
loss/damage insurance, and purchase security and extended protection
warranty, it exceeds all of the features that the dominant competitive
travel reward cards offer.  However, it is the travel rewards which make
this card unique.

<p>Applications for the card are available starting today at any
TD Branch.  People who sign up for the card by July 15, 1995 automatically receive
3,500 bonus points.

<h3>"YOUR BANK. YOUR WAY." MEANS HIGHER RETURNS FOR TD

<h3>Release Publication<br> Wednesday, May 10, 1995</h3> 

<h2>News Release - Communique</h2>

<h3>TD BANK INTERNET SITE RECOGNIZED AS ONE OF THE TOP 100 BUSINESS WEB SITES IN THE WORLD
</h3>


  
<P>TORONTO - Toronto Dominion Bank is pleased to announce that its
Internet World Wide Web (WWW) site (http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/) has
been recognized by Interactive Age magazine as one of the top 100
Business Web sites in the world.

<P>"With over 10,000 business sites in the running, we're extremely pleased
that our customer centric approach has hit a responsive chord not only
with Interactive Age, but with visitors to our site as well," says Steve
Gesner, Associate Vice President, Cash Management Services at TD Bank. 

<P><IMG ALIGN=left SRC="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/gifs/inter.gif">Interactive Age magazine, which bills itself as "The Newspaper for
Electronic Commerce" and leading Internet authority, announced their
selections of the 100 Best Business Web sites in a special report included
with the April 24, 1995 edition of the magazine.  Their selections were
based on these key criteria:  richness of content, ease of use, use of hot-
links, and quality of design.

<P>"I was quite surprised to see TD was the only Canadian based Web site to
make the Top 100 as there are a wide variety of top notch sites in Canada. 
However, much of the information we present has generic applicability to
people all over the world," says Gesner.

<P>Billing the site as the Financial Information Resource Centre for Canada,
"TD's goal is to be the ultimate financial services stop on the Infobahn. 
And we've got some interesting things coming in the next few months
which will help us realize that goal," adds Gesner.

<P>Since the launch of the site in late February 1995, TD's Web site has
welcomed over 20,000 visitors, who have accessed approximately
180,000 pages of information.  In addition, TD has received over 1000
messages from existing or prospective clients through its Internet 
e-mail links directed to Green Infoline, its customer information service,
Green Line Investor Services Inc., and Toronto Dominion Asset
Management.  "Thus far we've handled requests for further information on: 
MicroMax, Green Line's PC based online portfolio information and trading
service; how to open up a Green Line account; how to become a bill
payment receiver on Bankline, TD's telephone banking service, and finally,
from the U.K., Green Machine locations, to help with better vacation cash
flow planning," says Gesner.

<P>TD's address on the Internet is http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/ or contact
them via e-mail at greeninfoline@tdbank.ca

<h3>Release Publication<br> Monday, April 10, 1995</h3> 

<h2>News Release - Communique</h2>

<h3>ONTARIO AND QUEBEC WILL LEAD IN <br>ECONOMIC GROWTH THIS YEAR, 
SAY TD ECONOMISTS.
</h3>



<P>TORONTO - &quot;Ontario will be the top-performing provincial economy in
1995, and Quebec will rank second, as key manufacturing industries in
both provinces continue to expand at a steady pace,&quot; say TD economists in
the April 1995 issue of the annual publication, Report on the Provinces. 
Every province shared in the economic expansion last year, as economic
growth in Canada surpassed 4 per cent for the first time since 1988.  The
pace of economic growth in Canada is expected to moderate to 3.8 per cent
in 1995 and to 2.9 per cent in 1996, and all regions will be affected.

<P>Economic growth in Ontario and Quebec accelerated in 1994, spurred by
dramatic increases in exports of manufactured goods to the U.S. market. 
The economic performances of Ontario and Quebec remain closely tied to
the success of their respective manufacturing industries, which comprise
more than 20 per cent of economic activity in both provinces,
approximately double the comparable share in the rest of Canada.  By
1996, growth in manufacturing output will moderate in Ontario and
Quebec, in line with slower economic growth in the United States.

<P>Although significant job gains since mid-1994 have brought employment
in Ontario and Quebec almost exactly back to pre-recession levels by early
1995, there has been considerable variation in employment trends among
the major cities.  &quot;In a number of cities, including London and 
Kitchener-Waterloo, employment has surpassed pre-recession levels by a
wide margin, while in central Canada's two largest markets -- Toronto and 
Montreal -- employment remains shy of pre-recession levels,&quot; said 
Teresa Chandler, Senior Economist.

<P>Alberta's economy, which was the fastest-growing among the provinces
for the second year in a row in 1994, will post slower growth this year,
as the expansion in the oil and natural gas industry moderates.  &quot;In sharp
contrast to the early 1990's, when the two westernmost provinces
prospered as central Canada languished in recession, economic growth in
1995 will be marginally slower in Alberta and British Columbia than in
central Canada,&quot; said Ms. Chandler.  The pace of job creation in British
Columbia has slowed somewhat during the past year, and activity in both
the new and resale housing markets has declined.  The B.C. economy will
grow by 3.6 per cent this year, and the fortunes of the pulp and paper as
well as metals industries will continue to improve, buoyed by high
commodity prices and rising global demand. 

<P>The Manitoba economy will continue to grow by more than 3 per cent in
1995, as the mining and manufacturing sectors strengthen.  The
Saskatchewan economy performed well last year, helped by rapid growth
in the oil and gas and potash industries.  Economic growth in
Saskatchewan will moderate to 2.8 per cent this year.

<P>Prince Edward Island outperformed the other Atlantic provinces in 1994,
and will do so again in 1995, as construction of the fixed-link bridge
continues to support growth of more than 3 per cent.   Nova Scotia's
economy enjoyed a substantial rebound in employment last year, and
economic growth outpaced that of neighbouring New Brunswick by a
narrow margin.   Their positions will reverse this year, as the New
Brunswick economy grows at a faster pace than Nova Scotia's economy. 
Although prospects for the fishery are poor, the Newfoundland economy
will continue to post modest economic growth of about 2 per cent in 1995,
as it benefits from ongoing construction activity related to the Hibernia
offshore oil project.

<P>The growth forecasts for the provinces are as follows:

<PRE><b>
Real GDP Growth:
				1994e		1995f		1996f</b>

Newfoundland			2.2%		2.3%		2.1%		
P.E.I.				3.5%		3.2%		2.6%
Nova Scotia			3.1%		2.7%		2.5%

<h3>TORONTO-DOMINION BANK<br>ANNOUNCES REPURCHASE OF PREFERRED SHARES
</h3>

<p>TORONTO --  The Toronto-Dominion Bank announced today that its current
programme to repurchase up to 1,000,000 Class A, Series D Preferred
Shares will be extended to March 31, 1996.  The programme commenced
February 27, 1995.  Planned repurchases represent approximately 45.5 per
cent of the 2,200,000 issued and outstanding shares of the Series.  These
repurchases, in combination with previous repurchases of 3,800,000
shares since April 1991, will represent 80.0 per cent of the 6,000,000
originally issued and outstanding shares of the Series.  

<p>The Bank also announced that its current programme to repurchase up to
150,000 Class A, Series E Preferred Shares (designated as Class B, Series
1 Preferred Shares prior to March 15, 1993) will be extended to March 31,
1996.  The programme commenced February 27, 1995.  Planned
repurchases represent approximately 49.2 per cent of the 305,000 issued
and outstanding shares of the Series.  These repurchases in combination
with previous repurchases of 1,195,000 shares since March 1991, will
represent 89.7 per cent of the 1,500,000 originally issued and outstanding
shares of the Series.  

<p>The repurchases will be made at market prices, but not to exceed $25.00
per Series D Share and $101 per Series E Share, for a maximum
consideration of $40,150,000.  The repurchases will be made on the floor
of The Toronto Stock Exchange and/or The Montreal Exchange.  The Bank
has appointed Green Line Investor Services Inc. as its broker to make
purchases, with Toronto Dominion Securities Inc. acting as its agent.  

<p>The Bank's ratio of common equity to total assets was 5.1 per cent at
January 31, 1995, the highest ratio among Canadian banks.  The
repurchases would result in only a minor reduction in the January 31,
1995, common and preferred shareholders' equity of $5.8 billion.

<h2>News Release - Communique</h2>

<h3>TORONTO-DOMINION BANK<br>INTRODUCES ITS MEGA MORTGAGE COMBOS</h3>



<P>TORONTO - Toronto Dominion Bank today introduced its Mega Mortgage
Combos for First Time Buyers, Move Up Buyers, Happy Campers and Empty
Nesters.

<P>Using a &quot;combine and save&quot; approach to create value for customers, TD's
Mega Mortgage Combos offer mega deals on a home warranty program as
well as free financial services, cash bonuses, and even a complimentary
moving day pizza lunch.

<P>&quot;Our Mega Mortgage Combos are unique to the industry because we have
looked at where customers are in their life with respect to a home and a
mortgage.  With that perspective, we have then packaged products and
services according to what they have told us they would need depending on
whether they are buying their first home, trading up, renewing and staying
put, or are looking to invest,&quot; says Bruce Shirreff, Senior Vice President,
TD Mortgages.  

<P>&quot;As a result, each Combo starts with a TD Mortgage and then combines
cash bonuses, discounts and waived fees on all kinds of services so
customers save hundreds of dollars,&quot; adds Shirreff.

<P>Each new TD mortgage also comes with a free home warranty program
which protects customers from interior plumbing, electrical, and
appliance breakdown (up to 15 years old) for one full year.  

<P>Mega Mortgage Combos are on the menu at TD from March 20 to May 31 and
they are hot, hot, hot.  All TD branches have customer menus, place mats,
and bottles of Mega Mortgage Hot Sauce to add sizzle to the spring
mortgage market.  

<P>See local TD branches for details or call TD Green Infoline at 982-7730 in
Toronto or 1-800-387-2092 elsewhere in Canada to place an order today.

<h2>News Release - Communique</h2>

<h3>TORONTO-DOMINION BANK<br>OPENS TRADE SERVICES OFFICE IN HOUSTON</h3>


<p>TORONTO - Toronto Dominion Bank announced today that it has opened a
Trade Services Unit in Houston, Texas.  This is TD's first trade office in
the United States.

<p>"With ever increasing growth in international trade and
a marked increase in north/south trade
resulting from NAFTA, this is a
perfect time to establish a trade office in the U.S.," said Parker
Gallant,
Vice President, Trade Finance and Correspondent Banking.  "We have had
tremendous
success with our Canadian trade units and hope to develop the
market in the U.S."  

<p>This office is being established as a full service
trade services unit and will offer core trade finance
products including,
export letters of credit, import letters of credit, standby letters of
credit, with an
emphasis on export financing services.  "The key motivating
factor in opening this office is the
opportunity to do business with U.S.
exporters," said Gallant.   

<p>U.S. exports, excluding trade with Canada,
were US$346.7 billion, more than 13 times larger
than Canadian non-U.S.
exports.  Total U.S. export L/C volumes are estimated at
approximately
US$45 billion, also estimated at more than 13 times larger
than Canada.

<p>In addition, TD's Houston office will have access to the
Bank's FACILITRADE* system,
which is an automated process for import,
export, standby and guarantee letters of credit in both
US and foreign
currencies.
 
<p>TD strategically selected Houston as the site of its first U.S. trade
office for its position as one of
the major trading locations in the U.S.A.
and because it is ideally situated to take advantage of
NAFTA and expanding
Latin American trade.  

<p>"Houston is a perfect location to establish
TD's
U.S. trade finance unit," said Mark Mischnick, Director, Trade
Finance, U.S.A. "Houston is a
leading centre for international finance and
is positioned for tremendous growth in trade with
Mexico and the Southern
cone.  Initially, our office will be staffed by four seasoned, trade
finance
veterans who bring a combined background of over 80 years of trade
experience to this important
U.S. marketplace."  	

<p>TD's Houston office
opened for business on March 1, 1995.  TD also opened a
representative
office in Mexico in December 1994.

<h2>News Release - Communique</h2>

<h3>TORONTO-DOMINION BANK<br>ANNOUNCES REPURCHASE OF PREFERRED SHARES</h3> 

<p>TORONTO --  The Toronto-Dominion Bank
announced today its plans to repurchase,
between February 28, 1995 and
March 31, 1995, up to 1,000,000 Class A, Series D
Preferred Shares,
representing approximately 45.5 per cent of the 2,200,000 issued
and
outstanding shares of the Series.  These purchases, in combination with
previous
repurchases of 3,800,000 shares since April, 1991, will represent
80.0 per cent of the
originally issued and outstanding shares of the
Series.  

<p>The Bank also announced its plans to repurchase, between
February 28, 1995 and
March 31, 1995, up to 150,000 Class A, Series E
Preferred Shares (designated as Class B,
Series 1 Preferred Shares prior to
March 15, 1993), representing approximately 49.2 per
cent of the 305,000
issued and outstanding shares of the Series.  These purchases,
in
combination with previous repurchases of 1,195,000 shares since March,
1991, will
represent 89.7 per cent of the originally issued and outstanding
shares of the Series.  

<p>The Bank has requested approval from the
Superintendent of Financial Institutions to
extend the above repurchase
programmes to March 31, 1996.  

<p>The repurchases will be made at market
prices, but not to exceed $25.00 per Series D
Share and $101 per Series E
Share, for a maximum consideration of $40,150,000.  The
repurchases will be
made on the floor of The Toronto Stock Exchange and/or The
Montreal
Exchange.  The Bank has appointed Green Line Investor Services Inc. as
its
broker to make purchases, with Toronto Dominion Securities Inc. acting
as its agent.  

<p>Mr. Robert P. Kelly, Executive Vice
President explained that "Federal regulations of
bank capital adequacy
continue to make these preferred shares a less valuable part of
the Bank's
equity base.  While the Bank's strong common equity and Tier 1 capital
base,
the key measures of capital adequacy, will continue unchanged, the
repurchases will
result in a further reduction in the Bank's cost of
capital".  

<p>The Bank's ratio of common equity to total assets was 5.1 per
cent at January 31, 1995,
the highest ratio among Canadian banks.  The
repurchases would result in only a minor
reduction in the January 31, 1995,
common and preferred shareholders' equity of $5.8
billion.

<h3>Release Publication<br> Thursday, February 23, 1995</h3> <h2>News Release -
Communique</h2> <h3>TORONTO DOMINION REPORTS<br>FIRST QUARTER EARNINGS OF $179 MILLION</h3>



<p>TORONTO - Toronto Dominion Bank today reported net income of $179 million for
the first quarter of 1995,  an increase of $11 million over a year ago, and down 
$16 million from the preceding quarter.  TD achieved year-over-year growth in earnings
of 7% in the first quarter of 1995, as loan losses continued to decline.

<p>TD's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Richard M. Thomson and President, 
A. Charles Baillie said, &quot;While non-accrual loans were up slightly from the fourth quarter
of 1994, we expect the increase to be temporary and that further declines lie ahead. Our
loan loss estimate for 1995 is $240 million, of which $60 million was charged in the first
quarter.  This compares to loan losses of $113 million in the first quarter of 1994, and
$345 million for the year.&quot;

<p>TD experienced a reduction in interest margins to 2.52% from 3.15% a year ago, as a
result of sharply rising interest rates.  Partially offsetting this unfavourable development
was a 7% increase in other income from the first quarter of 1994 - mainly reflecting
growth in credit fees and our credit card business.  Another positive development in the
quarter was the moderation of expense growth - expenses were up by just 1% from a
year ago, despite ongoing investments in our businesses.  This led to an improvement in
our productivity ratio from the fourth quarter of 1994 - particularly important given the
squeeze on margins in our industry.

<p>During the quarter we continued to build momentum and to sharpen TD's competitive
edge with a number of key initiatives:</p><ul>
<li>In the highly competitive residential mortgage business, we improved customer
	service and built on our leadership in self service banking when we became the
	first bank in Canada to offer mortgage renewals by phone, on TD's Bankline;  we
	also acquired a high quality portfolio of residential mortgages from Confederation
	Trust Company, bringing 2,000 new customers to the Bank.
<p>
<li>To improve our customers' choices in and access to RSPs, we introduced &quot;TD
	Future Plan&quot;, a pre-approved loan program; we launched six new mutual funds to
	provide greater portfolio diversity;  we developed a new GIC - TD Rate
	Maximizer - which escalates interest rates over three and five years - of great
	appeal to customers who want to take advantage of rising interest rates; and we
	announced TD Trust Fund Navigator, providing individual investors with
	professional mutual fund investment management services from TD Trust.
<p>
<li>We continued our commitment to provide superior service to small and
	independent business customers by launching TD Business Service Plan - 
	a package of services which helps reduce bank charges.  We also introduced a
	business code of conduct, known as TD's Business Banking Relationship
	Standards - the first such code in Canadian banking.
<p>
<li>And we made a major step forward in our rapidly growing investment banking
	business with an agreement to acquire Lancaster Financial Holdings, Inc. - 
	a highly respected investment bank specializing in mergers and acquisitions and
	financial advisory services.  At the same time, we established a Merchant Banking
	unit to focus on complex financings and complement our enhanced advisory
	services - providing clients with a full range of transaction financing services on
	an integrated basis. </ul>

<p>As we look ahead, we remain concerned about upward pressure on interest rates and the
impact on the Canadian economy, on our customers and on our financial results. 
Ongoing growth in the Canadian economy is encouraging, and we are hopeful that the
governments in Canada will take serious steps to reduce their deficits and thereby help
stop the upward pressure on interest rates and the downward pressure on the Canadian
dollar.

<h3>REVIEW OF OPERATING PERFORMANCE</h3>

<p>Net income in the first quarter of 1995 was $179 million, an increase of $11 million over a
year ago, and down $16 million from the preceding quarter.  The improvement from a
year ago primarily resulted from a lower provision for credit losses and increased other
income, partly offset by reduced net interest income and higher non-interest expenses.

<p>Net income per share for the first quarter of 1995 was $.56 compared to $.62 for the
preceding quarter and $.52 for a year ago.

<p>Return on assets was .69% for the quarter compared to .74% for the previous year. 
Return on common equity was 13.2% for the quarter compared to 13.5% for the
previous year.

<p><b>Net interest income</b><br>
Although average earning assets for the quarter grew 13% from a year ago, net interest
income on a taxable equivalent basis decreased $63 million or 10% to $597 million.  This
resulted from a 63 basis point decline in net interest margin to 2.52% for the quarter. 
This was mainly caused by unfavourable changes in the mix of earning assets and
deposits which largely arose from increases in interest rates.  Specifically, deposit
customers shifted funds from low cost non-term deposits to high cost term deposits,
whereas for mortgage loans, customers mainly requested short term mortgages.  In
addition, during 1994 the Bank increased its proportion of earning assets in lower
yielding cash resources and securities held for trading, investment and liquidity
purposes.  

<p>Action taken by management in 1994 to reduce the Bank's exposure to interest rate
movements mitigated the impact of the sharp increase in market interest rates that
occurred during the quarter.  The estimated decrease in the Bank's annual net income
after tax that would arise from an immediate and sustained 1% increase in rates has been
reduced to $13 million from $16 million at the year end.

<p>During the quarter, the Bank realized $21 million in net investment securities gains, the
same level as a year ago and $12 million higher than the previous quarter.

<p><b>Credit quality and provision for credit losses</b><br>
Net non-accrual loans increased $37 million during the quarter to $764 million at
January 31, 1995 or 1.0% of total loans and bankers' acceptances, the same level as at
October 31, 1994.  The increase resulted from lending in the United States to the real
estate industry.  We expect net non-accrual loans to decline in future quarters.

<p>As a result of the general high credit quality of the Bank's loan portfolio, the loan loss
estimate for 1995 is $240 million, the lowest level since 1989 and compares to 
$345 million for the previous year. One quarter of the estimate for 1995, or $60 million,
was charged against income in the first quarter.

<p><b>Other income</b><br>
Other income at $309 million grew 7% over the prior year and reached the second
highest level for quarterly results.  The primary driving force behind this increase was the
strong growth in credit fees throughout the Bank's operations and the corporate
advisory fees generated in the United States.  In addition, card services income increased
significantly because of the strong contribution by TD/GM Visa Card.  Unfavourable
market conditions led to a reduction in income from foreign exchange.  Brokerage
commissions from Green Line Investor Services Inc. declined due to lower trading
volumes by customers.

<p><b>Non-interest expenses</b><br>
Non-interest expenses for the quarter increased only 1% over the same period a year
ago.  This moderation in expense growth was due to a reduction in performance related
compensation, and in spite of ongoing investments in new businesses.

<p>The Bank's productivity ratio for the quarter deteriorated to 60.4% from  57.1% in the
first quarter 1994, but improved from 63.3% in the previous quarter.

<p><b>Balance Sheet</b><br>
At January 31, 1995, the Bank's total assets rose above $100 billion for the first time to
reach $102.2 billion.  The 11% increase from a year ago was largely due to an increase in
all its credit lending business segments in Canada, and the increased value of the U.S.
dollar compared to the Canadian dollar.

<p>The market value of the Bank's securities portfolios held for investment and liquidity
purposes at January 31, 1995 was $428 million below cost, compared to $356 million at
October 31, 1994.  This was the result of recent increases in interest rates that reduced
the values of our Canadian and U.S. government bonds which have an average maturity
of 1.9 years.  The unrealized loss would be recognized only if the portfolios were sold
and it is management's intention to hold these securities to maturity.

<p>The Bank's personal deposits increased 2% from a year ago as individuals increased their
investments in term deposits in response to rising interest rates.

<p><b>Capital</b><br>
During the quarter, the Bank's common equity grew $155 million through increased
earnings after dividends of $104 million and unrealized foreign currency gains of 
$59 million from translation of investments in the Bank's foreign subsidiaries, partly
offset by $8 million in share issue expenses and other items.

<p>The Bank's total risk-weighted assets increased 4% during the quarter, the result of
increases in lending activity, and the value of U.S. dollar denominated assets.

<p>With these changes, the Bank's ratio of net common equity to risk-weighted assets
remained unchanged at 6.4% from a year ago.

<h3>TD BANK ANNOUNCES SITE ON THE INFORMATION HIGHWAY</h3>


<p>TORONTO - Reflecting the ongoing commitment to its public promise, "Your
Bank. Your Way.", TD Bank today introduced its World Wide Web (WWW) site
on the Internet.  And, in line with the culture of Cyberspace, TD's
presence on the Internet will provide an interactive information resource
centre to the millions of Internet users interested in financial
services.

<p>"With approximately 30,000 other institutions utilizing the "Web" to
reach their customer base, it is essential that we provide a high level
of value added information and services to Internet users in order to get
and keep their attention," said Steve Gesner, Associate Vice President,
Cash Management Services.  "By combining material from our various
business units, we have developed a site which should appeal to customers
ranging from the youngest personal banking customer, like my seven year
old nephew, to multinational corporations."

<p>Through its WWW site, TD offers a full spectrum of data and planning
tools, beginning with the more traditional recaps of its recent financial
performance and press releases.  To this base is added timely economic
reports from the Bank's leading economists, small business advice through
its Bu$inessmatters articles, mortgage advice, including a home buying
checklist, a recap of market indices, and extensive RRSP information,
which addresses a number of frequently asked questions while highlighting
the various investment options available to customers.  In this latter
regard, users will be able to access TD's Wealth Allocation Model (WAM)
online to assist in planning their investment portfolios.

<p>To further increase the utility of the site, TD will be offering a
variety of software packages for downloading free of charge to all interested parties.  Initially,
this offering includes BusinessPlanner (both DOS and Windows versions),
which assists customers in developing a business plan and related
information to support their financing requirements, as well as a
demonstration of TD Green Line's MicroMax software (DOS version).  And to
ensure the materials provided are meeting the needs of the users,
visitors to the site will be able to email their comments, requests for
additional information, or requests for follow up on the special offers
directly to TD.

<p>"We believe the site will become the ultimate financial services stop on
the Infobahn.  And we'll be adding new content and features regularly to
achieve that goal.  But of course, the real benefits to Internet users
begin once they've opened an account with us," added Gesner.

<p>TD's address on the Internet is http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/ or contact
them via e-mail at greeninfoline@tdbank.ca

<h3>THE TORONTO-DOMINION BANK ANNOUNCES REDEMPTION OF $125 Million 10.90% DEBENTURES</h3>

<p>TORONTO - The Toronto-Dominion Bank announced today it is calling for redemption of its outstanding $125 Million 10.90% Debentures due March 1, 2000.  The issue will become due and payable on March 1, 1995 at a redemption price of 100 per cent of the principal amount.  The debentures were originally issued in March 1990.  

<p>Mr. Robert P. Kelly, Executive Vice President explained that "The 10.90% Debentures represent very expensive Tier II capital by today's standards.  Redemption of the Debentures is cost effective and will have no effect on the Bank's strong Tier 1 capital ratio while the Bank's total capital ratio will remain strong at in excess of 10%."

<h3>TD BANK LAUNCHES A NEW PRE-APPROVED RSP LOAN PROGRAM</h3>


TORONTO - TD Bank announced today that it has launched "TD Future Plan", a unique RSP loan program providing customers with a financial planning tool to help them achieve their investment and retirement goals.
<p>
With TD Future Plan, customers are being offered pre-approved RSP loans at Prime Rate for any amount up to $14,500 for their 1994 RSP contribution.  The loan amount can be invested in TD Green Line Mutual Fund RSP, TD GIC RSP or TD Daily Interest RSP accounts.
<p>
Customers who borrow with TD Future Plan are required to pay only the accrued interest on the amount borrowed.  Each month, the payment which would have gone towards repaying the loan principal will instead be transferred into a TD RSP for the 1995 RSP contribution. Within 12 months, customers will have made a lump sum contribution to their RSP for 1994 as well as made monthly contributions to their RSP for 1995.
<p>
After the first 12 months of taking out TD Future Plan, customers can continue making regular payments through TD Future Plan to build up their RSP at a faster rate.
<p>
As long as customers participate with TD Future Plan, they may take up to 10 years to repay the TD Future Plan loan.
<p>
"TD Future Plan is ideal for customers who have difficulty finding the cash to make an RSP contribution.  It can also help establish a disciplined approach to building up an RSP," said Arthur English, Executive Vice President, Financial Services Division.  "Over the longer term, borrowing for an RSP makes sense because the benefits of tax savings and compound interest of an RSP will be greater than the interest cost of the RSP loan." 
<p>
For customers who use their TD Future Plan loan to purchase a Green Line Mutual Fund RSP and then make subsequent contributions to their Mutual Fund RSP with the Pre-Authorized Purchase Plan there is a significant benefit.  When buying mutual fund RSPs, many customers are concerned with timing the purchases of their RSP investments to ensure that they buy these investments when the cost is low.  The Pre-Authorized Purchase Plan can take the worry out of timing their investment purchases by allowing the customer to invest a fixed dollar amount in a Green Line Mutual Fund RSP on a regular basis, purchasing fewer units when prices are high and more units when prices are low.  Over time, this can result in a lower investment cost and smooth out the peaks and valleys caused by market fluctuations.
<p>
Customers can take advantage of the offer of pre-approved loans for any amount up to $14,500 until March 1, 1995.  TD Future Plan and TD RSP loans are available all year-round.

<h3>TD LAUNCHES NEW MUTUAL FUND MANAGEMENT SERVICE</h3>





TORONTO  - TD Trust today announced the launch of Fund Navigator*, an active investment management service designed for mutual fund investors with $100,000 or more to invest.  Fund Navigator combines the Green Line* Family of No-Load Mutual Funds with TD Trust's experience in managing individual portfolios for clients.

<p>

"Determining the most appropriate mutual fund mix and responding to changing market conditions can be very time-consuming," explained Charles Macfarlane, President, TD Trust Company. "In addition, staying abreast of market and economic conditions can be a daunting task for many investors."

<p>

"Fund Navigator helps clients determine and meet their investment goals with the help of investment professionals who will actively manage their portfolio," added Macfarlane.

<p>

Clients are assigned a personal portfolio manager who works with them to establish investment objectives. The portfolio manager then tailors an investment strategy and actively manages the portfolio to ensure the client's investment objectives continue to be met. 

<p>

"The launch of Fund Navigator is strategically timed so that we may offer this valuable service to Canadians who are about to finalize their RRSP arrangements for this year," said Macfarlane.

<p>

"Fund Navigator offers a broad range of portfolios to meet our customers' personal investment objectives and risk tolerances.  We have an experienced team of portfolio managers to help clients achieve their various objectives of safety, liquidity, income and capital growth," said Macfarlane.  

<p>

"We deliver a quality service at a competitive price.  Fund Navigator fees are charged as a percentage of the total mutual fund assets under administration, all funds are no-load and we don't charge for switching between funds," he added.  "It's also important to note that investment management fees for Fund Navigator are tax-deductible."

<p>

TORONTO - Toronto Dominion Bank announced today they have become the first bank to offer mortgage renewals over the phone.  Using Bankline, TD's automated telephone banking service, TD mortgage customers can quickly and easily renew their mortgage with the help of a Bankline agent.

INC.	
</h3>
			


<p>TORONTO - The Toronto-Dominion Bank announced today that it has agreed to purchase

Bank to provide its clients with a full range of transaction financing services on an integrated basis. 
&quot;We will be adding a focused and sophisticated financing capability to the enhanced advisory
capability we will gain from Lancaster,&quot; he said.  &quot;In this way, TD and TDSI will be able to

<h3>Release

Publication<br>Thursday, November 24, 1994</h3>



<h2>News Release - Communique</h2>



<h3>Toronto Dominion Reports Net Income Of $683 Million For 1994</h3>



<p>TORONTO - Toronto Dominion Bank today announced net income of $195 million or $.62 per common
share for the fourth quarter of 1994, up from $82 million or $.25 per common share in 1993.  This
brought net income for the year to $683 million or $2.14 per common share - more than double the
level of 1993.</p>



<p>"The most positive news for the fourth quarter - for the Bank and for our customers - was the
continued improvement in our credit business," said TD's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,
Richard M. Thomson and President, Robert W. Korthals.   "Provision for loan losses for the year
initially forecast at $450 million at the end of the first quarter was reduced to $400 million at the
end of the third quarter and has now been finalized at $345 million, which includes an increase in
the general reserves of $38 million.  As a result of these positive developments, only $32 million in
loan losses was required in the fourth quarter."</p>



<p>Net non-accrual loans have declined sharply to $727 million from $932 million at the end of the
third quarter and $1,219 million at the start of the fiscal year.</p>



<p>Rising interest rates had a negative impact on margins, and the Bank significantly reduced this
exposure during the year.  The increase in expenses was largely due to ongoing investments in TD's
new and expanding businesses.  Significant start-up costs were incurred for the TD/GM Visa Card, a
product which has gained over a million new accounts for the Bank and which we expect to make a
positive contribution to earnings in 1995.</p>



<p>During the quarter, we built on the momentum of TD's development of new and expanding businesses
with strong internal growth.  Significant developments in TD's businesses during the quarter
included:</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/Small_Business/index.html">Small Business Banking</a> - where we continued our efforts to improve service to this vital sector with: the launch of TD Business Service Plan - a package of services specifically designed for independent businesses; the announcement of a significant new financing program for the automotive parts sector - improving the availability of capital for this sector by funding the cost of making tools and molds; and the release of our popular TD Business Planner Software in Windows format;
<p></p>
<li>Institutional Equities - where we continued to gain market position on the strength of our highly praised research and trading;
<p></p>
<li><a href="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/Greenline/english/mfam.html">Mutual Funds</a> - where we announced that we would be adding six new funds to the Green Line Family of No-Load Mutual Funds, bringing the total to 31, and responding to customer demand for more choice in the global marketplace; we introduced a National Review -  a comprehensive education program to boost the expertise of TD's 3,200 mutual fund professionals; and we launched "Women in the Know", a new seminar series specifically designed to meet the needs of female investors;
<p></p>
<li>TD Evergreen Investment Services Inc. - where we continued rapid expansion of our full service retail brokerage operation, which now has 17 offices across Canada.
</ul>

<p></p>

</ul>

<p>During the quarter, we also announced the retirement (effective January 31, 1995) of Robert W.
Korthals, who has been President since 1981 and has helped guide the Bank through a period of
unprecedented challenge and change, and the appointment of A. Charles Baillie, Vice Chairman and
architect of TD's emergence as an investment bank, as the new President (effective February 1,
1995).</p>



<p>With ongoing strength in the Canadian economy, the momentum we have been building in our new
businesses, and the continued efforts of TD employees who have been working hard to deliver more to
customers, we expect another good year in 1995, with further improvements in results and continued
progress in the development of TD's business.  To reflect the improvement in results, the quarterly
dividend per common share has been declared at $.22 for the quarter ending January 31, 1995, an
increase of $.02 over the previous dividend.</p>

<h2>Review Of Operating Performance</h2>



<p>Net income in the fourth quarter of 1994 was $195 million, an increase of 

$74 million over a year ago, after excluding a $39 million after-tax write-off of the purchase price
for the Marathon Brokerage business, and up $33 million from the previous quarter.  The significant
improvement from a year ago primarily resulted from a lower provision for credit losses.</p>



<p>On the same basis, net income per share for the fourth quarter of 1994 at $.62 was higher than the
$.50 earned in the previous quarter and significantly higher than the $.38 reported a year ago. 
These improved earnings from a year ago produced increases in the return on assets from .56% to .78%
and in the return on common equity from 9.9% to 14.8%.</p>



<p>As a result of the Bank's strong performance throughout 1994, net income reached $683 million or
$2.14 per share - more than double the level of 1993.</p>



<p>During the year the Bank continued to invest heavily in new businesses.  Notably, the launch of
the TD/GM Visa Card, begun in 1993, has been the most successful ever experienced in Canada with 1.2
million new accounts added to date.  In 1994, this segment of our business was unprofitable because
of start-up expenses of $100 million.  Cumulative start-up costs amount to approximately $100 per
account.  These expenses relate to account acquisition including marketing, promotion and application
processing costs, and loan losses in excess of expected ongoing levels.  All of these expenses were
magnified because card volumes were much higher than anticipated.  We expect the TD/GM Visa Card to
make a positive contribution in 1995 and are very pleased with the outlook for the new segment of our
business.</p>



<h3>Net Interest Income</h3>

<p>Net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis for the quarter was $644 million, an increase of
2% from a year ago.  The primary reason for this increase was the 13% growth in the Bank's average
earning assets to $89.9 billion.</p>



<p>The rate of decline experienced by the Bank in its net interest margin during the preceding two
quarters slowed during this quarter as the  Bank's margin decreased to 2.84% from 2.87% in the
previous quarter.  This decline was primarily due to actions taken by management to reduce the Bank's
exposure to future interest rate increases, and to the growth in lower yielding government securities
held for trading purposes, partly offset by increased loan fees and lower net interest exclusions as a
result of the decline in non-accrual loans.</p>



<p>During the quarter, the Bank realized net investment securities gains of $9 million compared to
net losses of $1 million a year ago.</p>



<h3>Credit Quality And Provision For Credit Losses</h3>

<p>Provision for loan losses for the year initially forecast at $450 million at the end of the first
quarter was reduced to $400 million at the end of the third quarter and has now been finalized at
$345 million.  Losses of $313 million were expensed in the first three quarters resulting in $32
million being included in the fourth quarter results.  The 1994 loss provision included a $38 million
increase in general reserves which now total $234 million.</p>



<p>Net non accrual loans have declined sharply to $727 million from $932 million at the end of the
third quarter and $1,219 million at the start of the fiscal year.</p>



<h3>OTHER INCOME</h3>

<p>Other income grew 3% over the prior year, and 12%, excluding card services.  Card services income
declined $21 million this quarter compared to a year ago, as it was negatively impacted by the
write-off of the remaining unamortized account acquisition costs related to the issuance of TD/GM
Visa Cards.  The strength in North American economic activity compared to a year ago contributed to a
strong growth of 38% in credit fees.  In addition, the Bank experienced a strong increase in
securities fees of 27% from brokerage activity, management of the Bank's mutual funds and securities
underwriting.</p>



<p>Excluding the negative impact of card services, other income compared to the prior quarter
remained unchanged.  Increased commissions generated by Green Line Investor Services Inc. and TD
Evergreen Investment Services Inc. due to higher trading volumes by customers were offset by lower
income in other securities activity.</p>



<h3>Non-Interest Expenses</h3>

<p>As a result of the outstanding efforts of the Bank's staff in completing integration of the
businesses purchased from Central Guaranty Trust Company, the Bank during the quarter reversed $20
million of the restructuring provision established in 1993.  Excluding this item, non-interest
expenses for the quarter increased 11% over the same quarter a year ago.  Expenses related to new
businesses such as TD/GM Visa and expanded businesses such as securities (Green Line Investor
Services Inc., TD Evergreen Investment Services Inc. and Toronto Dominion Securities Inc.) and trust,
together with higher CDIC premiums, continued to be the major factors contributing to this increase. 
Excluding these factors, expense growth was approximately 3%.</p>



<p>The Bank's productivity ratio for the quarter of 61.1% was less favourable than 60.4% in the
previous quarter.  Excluding the negative impact on earnings of the TD/GM Visa Card, the Bank's
productivity ratio was essentially the same for both quarters.</p>



<h3>Balance Sheet</h3>

<p>At October 31, 1994, total assets were $99.8 billion, an increase of 17% from a year ago primarily
due to higher levels of government securities, business loans and residential mortgages.  The growth
in business loans and acceptances was generated primarily by the strengthened economic conditions in
North America and by the increased value of the U.S. dollar compared to the Canadian dollar.  Loans
provided under the Small Business Loans Act increased approximately 20% during the quarter.</p>



<p>Total personal deposits increased $787 million or 2% from a year ago, and $932 million from July
31, 1994.  This growth resulted from more attractive interest rates for term deposits.  In addition,
mutual funds managed by the Bank grew almost $1 billion from the previous year.</p>



<h3>Capital</h3>

<p>As a result of strong internal generation of earnings, the Bank's common equity grew $434 million
or 9% in 1994.  Total risk-weighted assets increased 6% primarily due to increased lending activity. 
With these changes, the Bank's ratio of common equity to risk-weighted assets improved to 6.5% from
6.3% a year ago.</p>

<h3>LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS</h3> 
<p>TD achieved year-over-year growth in earnings
of 7% in the first quarter of 1995, as loan losses continued to decline.
<p>While non-accrual loans were up slightly from the fourth quarter of 1994, we
expect the increase to be temporary and that further declines lie ahead. Our
loan loss estimate for 1995 is $240 million, of which $60 million was charged in
the first quarter. This compares to loan losses of $113 million in the first
quarter of 1994, and $345 million for the year. 

<p>TD experienced a reduction in
interest margins to 2.52% from 3.15% a year ago, as a result of sharply rising
interest rates. Partially offsetting this unfavourable development was a 7%
increase in other income from the first quarter of 1994 - mainly reflecting
growth in credit fees and our credit card business. Another positive development
in the quarter was the moderation of expense growth - expenses were up by just
1% from a year ago, despite ongoing investments in our businesses. This led to
an improvement in our productivity ratio from the fourth quarter of 1994 -
particularly important given the squeeze on margins in our industry. 

<p>During the
quarter we continued to build momentum and to sharpen TD's competitive edge with
a number of key initiatives: 
<ul><li>In the highly competitive residential mortgage
business, we improved customer service and built on our leadership in self
service banking when we became the first bank in Canada to offer mortgage
renewals by phone, on TD's Bankline; we also acquired a high quality portfolio
of residential mortgages from Confederation Trust Company, bringing 2,000 new
customers to the Bank. 
<li>To improve our customers' choices in and access to
RSPs, we introduced "TD Future Plan", a pre-approved loan program; we launched
six new mutual funds to provide greater portfolio diversity; we developed a new
GIC - TD Rate Maximizer - which escalates interest rates over three and five
years - of great appeal to customers who want to take advantage of rising
interest rates; and we announced TD Trust Fund Navigator, providing individual
investors with professional mutual fund investment management services from TD
Trust.

<li>We continued our commitment to provide superior service to small and
independent business customers by launching TD Business Service Plan - a package
of services which helps reduce bank charges. We also introduced a business code
of conduct, known as TD's Business Banking Relationship Standards - the first
such code in Canadian banking.

<li>And we made a major step forward in our
rapidly growing investment banking business with an agreement to acquire
Lancaster Financial Holdings, Inc. - a highly respected investment bank
specializing in mergers and acquisitions and financial advisory services. At the
same time, we established a Merchant Banking unit to focus on complex financings
and complement our enhanced advisory services - providing clients with a full
range of transaction financing services on an integrated basis.  </ul>

<p>As we look
ahead, we remain concerned about upward pressure on interest rates and the
impact on the Canadian economy, on our customers and on our financial results.
Ongoing growth in the Canadian economy is encouraging, and we are hopeful that
the governments in Canada will take serious steps to reduce their deficits and
thereby help stop the upward pressure on interest rates and the downward
pressure on the Canadian dollar.

<h3>REVIEW OF OPERATING PERFORMANCE</h3>

<p>Net income in the first quarter of 1995 was $179 million, an increase of $11
million over a year ago, and down $16 million from the preceding quarter. The
improvement from a year ago primarily resulted from a lower provision for credit
losses and increased other income, partly offset by reduced net interest income
and higher non-interest expenses. 

<p>Net income per share for the first quarter of
1995 was $.56 compared to $.62 for the preceding quarter and $.52 for a year
ago. 

<p>Return on assets was .69% for the quarter compared to .74% for the previous
year. Return on common equity was 13.2% for the quarter compared to 13.5% for
the previous year. 

<p><b>Net Interest Income</b><br>
Although average earning assets for the
quarter grew 13% from a year ago, net interest income on a taxable equivalent
basis decreased $63 million or 10% to $597 million. This resulted from a 63
basis point decline in net interest margin to 2.52% for the quarter. This was
mainly caused by unfavourable changes in the mix of earning assets and deposits
which largely arose from increases in interest rates. Specifically, deposit
customers shifted funds from low cost non-term deposits to high cost term
deposits, whereas for mortgage loans, customers mainly requested short term
mortgages. In addition, during 1994 the Bank increased its proportion of earning
assets in lower yielding cash resources and securities held for trading,
investment and liquidity purposes.

<p>Action taken by management in 1994 to reduce the Bank's exposure to interest
rate movements mitigated the impact of the sharp increase in market interest
rates that occurred during the quarter. The estimated decrease in the Bank's
annual net income after tax that would arise from an immediate and sustained 1%
increase in rates has been reduced to $13 million from $16 million at the year
end. 
<p>During the quarter, the Bank realized $21 million in net investment
securities gains, the same level as a year ago and $12 million higher than the
previous quarter. 

<p><b>Credit Quality and Provision for Credit Losses</b><br> 
Net non-accrual
loans increased $37 million during the quarter to $764 million at January 31,
1995 or 1.0% of total loans and bankers' acceptances, the same level as at
October 31, 1994. The increase resulted from lending in the United States to the
real estate industry. We expect net non-accrual loans to decline in future
quarters. 

<p>As a result of the general high credit quality of the Bank's loan
portfolio, the loan loss estimate for 1995 is $240 million, the lowest level
since 1989 and compares to $345 million for the previous year. One quarter of
the estimate for 1995, or $60 million, was charged against income in the first
quarter.

<p><b>Other Income</b><br>
Other income at $309 million grew 7% over the prior year and
reached the second highest level for quarterly results. The primary driving
force behind this increase was the strong growth in credit fees throughout the
Bank's operations and the corporate advisory fees generated in the United
States. In addition, card services income increased significantly because of the
strong contribution by TD/GM Visa Card. Unfavourable market conditions led to a
reduction in income from foreign exchange. Brokerage commissions from Green Line
Investor Services Inc. declined due to lower trading volumes by customers.

<p><b>Non-interest expenses</b><br> 
Non-interest expenses for the quarter increased only 1%
over the same period a year ago. This moderation in expense growth was due to a
reduction in performance related compensation, and in spite of ongoing
investments in new businesses. 

<p>The Bank's productivity ratio for the quarter
deteriorated to 60.4% from 57.1% in the first quarter 1994, but improved from
63.3% in the previous quarter. 

<p><b>Balance Sheet</b><br>
At January 31, 1995, the Bank's
total assets rose above $100 billion for the first time to reach $102.2 billion.
The 11% increase from a year ago was largely due to an increase in all its
credit lending business segments in Canada, and the increased value of the U.S.
dollar compared to the Canadian dollar.

<p>The market value of the Bank's securities portfolios held for investment and
liquidity purposes at January 31, 1995 was $428 million below cost, compared to
$356 million at October 31, 1994. This was the result of recent increases in
interest rates that reduced the values of our Canadian and U.S. government bonds
which have an average maturity of 1.9 years. The unrealized loss would be
recognized only if the portfolios were sold and it is management's intention to
hold these securities to maturity. 

<p>The Bank's personal deposits increased 2%
from a year ago as individuals increased their investments in term deposits in
response to rising interest rates. 

<p><b>Capital</b><br>
During the quarter, the Bank's common
equity grew $155 million through increased earnings after dividends of $104
million and unrealized foreign currency gains of $59 million from translation of
investments in the Bank's foreign subsidiaries, partly offset by $8 million in
share issue expenses and other items. 

<p>The Bank's total risk-weighted assets
increased 4% during the quarter, the result of increases in lending activity,
and the value of U.S. dollar denominated assets. 

<p>With these changes, the Bank's
ratio of net common equity to risk-weighted assets remained unchanged at 6.4%
from a year ago.<hr>

<HR>
<P><A NAME="q1"><B>1.Can processing a credit payment ever be as convenient</A> for me as it is for my customers to pay by credit?</B>

<P>Today's technologies are designed not only for the convenience of  customers but for merchants as well.  Time-consuming manual reconciliations are a thing of the past.  The less automated ways of processing and depositing funds are being replaced by fully automated system options that speed payments and streamline sales efficiency.  The range and flexibility of processing options put you in control of deciding on the best system to meet your business needs.  Consider the following options: 

<P><UL><LI><B><A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/bizexch/cmprod/tdpx.htm">Electronic Data Transfer (EDT)</A></B>

<P>When it comes to reducing the time and effort it takes to get  your credit card receipts to the bank, an electronic data transfer system (EDT) can significantly improve your processing time over other less automated ways of processing and depositing (e.g. paper based systems, electronic files or magnetic tapes.)  Choosing to move your funds electronically through an EDT system can help you streamline the way you work and can give you access to funds, on average, twice as fast as with less automated systems.  

<P><LI><B><A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/merchvisa/services/greenkey.html">Draft capture terminals</A> </B>

<P>A point-of-sale processing option which can provide you with a fast, streamlined way to automatically process major credit card transactions and/or <I>Interac</I> Direct Payment transactions

<P>An automated terminal frees staff from calling in for authorizations; a swipe of the customer's credit card does it for you.  Of course, that means your customer speeds through the line quicker, too.  Better yet, the money's in your account by the end of the day, without the time-consuming chore of filling out deposit summaries, and all the risk of error that entails.

<P>If you're in the restaurant business, you might consider a special draft capture terminal.  When your servers receive a credit card for payment, the terminal automatically authorizes the amount plus a gratuity. This means there's no need to re-authorize the amount after the customer fills in the tip.
</UL>
 
 
<P><A NAME="q2"><B>2.What is a Draft Capture Terminal?</A>  What are its benefits?</B>

<P>A draft capture terminal allows you to automatically authorize credit transactions by simply pressing a few terminal keys rather than manually dialing in to a credit authorization centre.   This approach helps to simplify your processes and can be a significant time saver for you and your staff.  And your customers benefit with shorter waits to pay for their purchases.  A draft capture terminal also deposits the payment directly to your account that day, giving you better cash flow without the time and effort required to consolidate draft slips and prepare deposit statements.  With the added convenience of a printer, the system takes care of everything required for the card sale from authorization of the transaction to printing of the receipt.

<P><A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/merchvisa/services/index.html">To review more information about Merchant Visa Draft Capture products</A>

<P><A NAME="q3"><B>3. Am I responsible for costs associated with</A> the installation of a POS terminal?  </B>

<P>You are responsible for the cost of any necessary wiring and line installation. You can choose to rent or buy the equipment and /or software to process the transactions.  To keep transactions moving quickly and smoothly -- and keep customers happy -- it's a good idea to have a dedicated line for draft capture terminals.  The phone company will install this for you.  There is also the  option of sharing a phone line with a phone or fax by purchasing a line splitter or line isolating device.


<P><A NAME="q4"><B>4. What are my options for building an automated</A> credit/Direct Payment system into the electronic cash register system I already have? </B>

<P>Consider an integrated system that connects a PIN pad to the store's cash register, allowing the existing electronic cash register to act as a terminal.  This frees your staff from entering totals twice, and lets you tie in your Direct Payment system with any cash or credit transaction features already built into your cash register.  The electronic cash register software will require some modification to allow for integration.  Check with your software supplier to see if your cash register is capable of being modified.

<P><A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/merchvisa/services/index.html">To review more information about TD Merchant Visa integrated payment systems</A>

<P><A NAME="q5"><B>5. I have three store locations across Canada; can</A> I have all the transaction reports sent to a central store in Toronto?</B>

<P>You can arrange to have individual daily transaction reports sent to any other locations or outlets that are part of the same chain.  You could send reports to a retail store, a central store or leader store.

<P><A NAME="q6"><B>6. How do I avoid credit chargebacks?</B></A>

<P>The key to avoiding a credit chargeback (i.e. a disputed charge), is to ensure that sales drafts are  signed and imprinted (either automatically through a draft capture terminal or manually by a manual imprinter) and are properly authorized at the time of the sale.  This is the proof you need that both the Cardholder and the Card were present at the time the transaction was authorized.


<P><A NAME="q7"><B>7. What is meant by the term "Floor Limit"?</A></B>

<P>This is the most you could charge on an individual VISA transaction without obtaining an authorization from VISA.  The Bank would not be obligated to credit you for amounts beyond this without an authorization number.  Most financial institutions suggest that you minimize the risk of having a transaction disputed by maintaining a zero floor limit so that all transactions are authorized.

<P><A NAME="q8"><B>8. How do I protect myself from credit card fraud?</A></B>

<P>Credit card fraud is definitely present and although this type of fraud may be a fact of life, there are ways to curb its impact on our economy - and protect your organization.  Here are a few tips to help you keep fraud prevention top-of-mind with your sales staff:

<P><B>Educate:</B>  Make sure your staff knows what to look for when examining a Card and that they know the appropriate measures to follow should they encounter a counterfeit or stolen Card.

<P><B>Establish clear procedures and review them regularly:</B>  Your staff should follow clearly outlined steps when performing credit card transactions, including checking the signature on the back of the Card with the signed sales draft.  Ensure new employees understand and follow the established procedures.

<P><B>Listen:</B>  If employees are worried about what to do when they encounter a suspicious Card, try role-playing.  Satisfy yourself that they are comfortable with, and understand, what to do if they suspect a Card is fraudulent, or a transaction is suspicious.


<P><A NAME="q9"><B>9.Why do consumers and retailers choose Direct Payment?</A></B>

<P>Some people prefer not to use credit cards, or they reserve their credit card use for certain items.  This means they either pay by cash -- which means carrying large amounts of cash around with them every day -- or they write cheques, which some retailers won't accept.  Direct Payment allows them to pay by cash with the convenience they'd normally get only with credit cards.  (Many retailers have found the ease of using Direct Payment cards has increased impulse buying which can tend to make the average bank card purchase higher than when cash or cheque are used.)

<P><A NAME="q10"><B>10. How popular is Direct Payment?</A></B>

<P>Since the introduction of this payment method, the numbers of transactions continue to grow beyond expectations.  In August, 1995, 7 million Canadians paid for over $1.6 million worth of goods with their bank cards.  With over 23 million bank cards active in Canada and the growing trend in  offering the Direct Payment service, the popularity of Direct Payment transactions can only increase.

<P><A NAME="q11"><B>11. How will I know if the customer who is using a </A>bank card has enough money in his/her account?
</B>

<P>The terminal will discover instantly whether funds are available or not, and will reject the transaction if your customer doesn't have enough money in the account.



<P><A NAME="q12"><B>12. What if a customer wants to return merchandise that they bought with their bank card?</A></B>

<P>It's as easy as any other refund.  In fact, like credit card refunds, you have a couple of options.  You can simply treat it as a cash purchase refund and refund the customer immediately with cash, or you can credit your customer's bank account by using his or her card to issue a credit through your terminal.


<P><A NAME="q13"><B>13. What type of security or fraud protection is there with the Direct Payment POS system?</A></B>

<P>The customer's personal identification number (PIN) protects both you and your customer.  This means that even if someone else other than the owner of the card gets hold of a bank card, purchases cannot be made without knowing the PIN.  The terminal will only allow a certain number of attempts to enter the right PIN number before it rejects the transaction (the number of attempts allowed varies by the card issuing financial institution).

<P>And if the customer doesn't have enough funds to cover the purchase, the transaction will be rejected.

<P><A NAME="q14"><B>14. What does it cost me to offer Direct Payment?</A></B>

<P>To get started, you'll either rent or buy the equipment and/or software to process the transactions.  And it's a good idea to have a dedicated telephone line.  Beyond that, you'll simply need to buy things like printer supplies (if you have a printer.)  And you'll pay a fee on each transaction.

<P><A NAME="q15"><B>15. What is a stand-alone Direct Payment terminal?</A></B>

<P>This type of terminal provides everything you need to accept and process Direct Payment transactions.  The terminal itself includes a card reader through which your customer's card is swiped.  A PIN Pad lets customers enter their PIN number, and a printer produces sales receipts. This system, which might also incorporate credit card draft capture features, is used by simply keying in the sales total on the Direct Payment terminal.

<P>To set up a terminal which processes Direct Payment transactions and provides automatic deposit and authorization for credit cards, you can simply rent the equipment from the bank.

<P>But, if you already process transactions through an IBM-compatible computer, you might decide to purchase a software package that handles automatic authorization and deposit for credit card payments, and turns your computer into a Direct Payment terminal.  Once you have the software, your only additional purchase is the PIN pad.

<P><A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/merchvisa/services/posdirect.html">To review more information on TD Merchant Visa Direct Payment terminals</A>
<P><A NAME="q16"><B>16. Is there an <I>Interac</I> fee or service charge for consumers using a Direct Payment Card?</A></B>

<P>Yes, consumers are charged a transaction fee comparable to what is charged for an ABM transaction, unless they have an Account Service plan that includes Direct Payment transactions.  The amount of the charge on a Direct Payment transaction is determined by the financial institution backing the transaction, it is not levied by <I>Interac</I>.  

<P><A NAME="q17"><B>17. Who do I call if a customer's banking machine card</A> does not work? (ie. the magstripe is defective or the card is declined?)</B>

<P>If you're following proper procedures and can't get the customer's card to work, you should suggest the customer contact his or her branch to resolve the problem.  It's not your responsibility to call the Bank.

<P><A NAME="q18"><B>18. I already have a credit card terminal and want to add a</A> Direct Payment option.  Does it have to come from the same financial institution?</B>

<P>No.  You can arrange for independently run systems for both credit and Direct Payment transactions or work with your financial institution to develop an integrated system solution that supports both.   

<P><A NAME="q19"><B>19. Does a TD Direct Payment System take only TD Personal Access Cards?</A></B>

<P>No, bank cards from any major institution in Canada within the <I>Interac</I> system are accepted by TD Direct Payment POS terminals.  International ABM cards may be accepted in the near future.

<P><A NAME="q20"><B>20. What type of system support can I count on?</A></B>

<P>It varies by institution, but normally if you have questions or problems, you can access a Help Desk 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  A service representative will help you resolve your problem or send a service technician to your business.  

<P>At TD, if you call before 4 p.m. (EST), the technician will be there within four hours.  If you call after 4, the technician will arrive by 10 a.m. the next day (including Saturdays and Sundays).

<H2>Streamlining cash and credit payments</H2>

<P>Make things easier on your customers... and yourself... with more effective transaction methods.



<P>The beep of a PIN pad is music to the ears of more and more retailers these days, as increasing numbers offer their customers the convenience of debit card payments.  In fact, owners of everything from gas stations to hardware stores to bars and restaurants are finding it's virtually a competitive necessity.

<P>Maybe it's the ease of payment.  Rather than writing cheques or carrying and counting out cash, customers simply swipe their debit cards through a reader, then punch their PIN number on a small keypad.  But whatever the reason, acceptance of this new method of payment has exceeded the most optimistic industry projections.

<P>In July, 1995 alone, 6.7 million Canadians laid down their bank cards to make $33.7 million in purchases.

And with 24 million bank cards out there, Interac, the association that runs the system, projects a 30-50 percent increase in dollar volume by mid '96.

<P>To retailers, debit cards offer many of the benefits that were previously only available through credit card transactions:

<UL>
	<LI>Instant deposit to your account

	<LI>Reduced accounts receivable and improved cash flow

	<LI>Security (you know the money's there)

	<LI>And the opportunity to offer customer convenience whether you're a large or small operation
</UL>

<P>But won't the popularity of debit cut into credit card use?

<P>It doesn't look like it.  According to the Canadian Bankers Association, credit card use continues to grow, and it's likely that debit cards simply provide the convenience of credit cards to those who have always preferred to pay by cash or cheque.

<P>1994 stats show purchases on Visa and MasterCard were up 26 percent from their 1992 level.  That's more than a quarter of all retail sales volumes that year.

<P>Many merchants have found the <A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/merchvisa/services/customized.html">automated authorization network</A> makes these payments even more welcome than before.  Transactions are authorized immediately, reducing the risk of chargebacks and NSF cheques, and the money is in your account the same day.

<H2>How to protect your business from credit card fraud</H2>

<P>Credit card fraud shouldn't be a problem.  Between <A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/merchvisa/services/poscredit.html">new authorization technology</A> and the cards themselves, it's getting harder for the would-be fraud artist.

<P>Here's how you can protect your business.

<OL>
	<LI><A HREF="#q1">Examine the card</A>
	<LI><A HREF="#q2">Always authorize.</A>
	<LI><A HREF="#q3">Watch for suspicious behavior</A>
	<LI><A HREF="#q4">When experiencing technical difficulties...</A>
	<LI><A HREF="#q5">Know the drill</A> 
</OL>
<HR>
<P><A NAME="q1"><H2>1. Examine the card</H2></A>

<P>The 3-D hologram will change colour when you view it from different angles.  This is hard to reproduce, and a counterfeit image may be of inferior quality or may not change colour.

<P>On a VISA card, there should be an embossed 'V' symbol preceded by a C, B or P after the expiry date.

<P>Just above the first four digits of the cardholder number is a printed four-digit number (identifying the issuing bank).  These two numbers should match.

<P>A VISA signature panel should bear the repeated imprint of the VISA wordmark.  If it's blank or damaged, it might be stolen or counterfeit.  Always watch the customer sign the sales draft, and compare this to the signature on the card before handing back the card.

<P>Check to see that the card hasn't expired.
<HR>
<P><A NAME="q2"><H2>2. Always authorize.</H2></A>

<P>Whether you have an automatic authorization terminal or not, make sure you authorize the transaction.  The terminals make it even easier to protect yourself.  Swipe the card through the terminal, and you'll get an authorization number, or a message to call your credit card centre.  If you get this, hang on to the card and call.
<HR>
<P><A NAME="q3"><H2>3.  Watch for suspicious behavior</H2></A>

<P>You and your staff should watch out for customers who:

<UL>
	<LI>purchase merchandise indiscriminately, without regard to size, colour, style or price.

	<LI>make purchases, leave the store and then return shortly to make additional purchases.
	<LI>make purchases at closing time, refuse free delivery for large items, act impatiently or urge you to complete the sale quickly
</UL>
<HR>
<P><A NAME="q4"><H2>4. When experiencing technical difficulties...</H2></A>

<P>If there's a problem with the magnetic stripe on the credit card, or if you have printer problems and you need to key in the card number for an authorization, your best backup is still a manually imprinted and signed sales draft.  This proves both the card and the person were present when the transaction occurred.
<HR>
<P><A NAME="q5"><H2>5. Know the drill</H2></A> 

<P>Make sure all your employees follow these steps and a standard set of procedures if they suspect a stolen or counterfeit card.  Your bank can help you with reference materials.

<H2>New ways to pay</H2>

<P>Technology is changing the way we think of cash, and it might just make your job easier.


<P>Will that be cash or charge or direct payment card or stored value card or...?

<P>The whole notion of currency and the way we pay for goods is rapidly evolving.  As the front-line of commerce, retailers are the first to be affected.  But don't worry; the changes just might be for the better.

<P>Many experts say electronic commerce (or EC), promises to make buying and selling quicker, easier and more convenient -- for you and your customers -- while reducing your cash management costs.

<P>And if Market Facts of Canada is right, that's good news.  The research firm says there will be more than 6 million "smart cards" and "stored value cards" in circulation in Canada by 2001.  The first Canadian tests start in '96.

<P>To help you prepare for the electronic marketplace, here's some background on a couple of the technologies that could be as common as credit cards in a few years.


<UL>
	<LI><A HREF="#q1">Electronic cash</A>
	<LI><A HREF="#q2">The Electronic Mall</A>
</UL>
<HR>
<P><H3><A NAME="q1">Electronic cash</A></H3>

<P>The basic idea behind electronic cash is this: customers store cash amounts on computer chips embedded in "smart cards", which look like traditional credit or bank cards.  An electronic system adds or subtracts from the total during a transaction.  These cards differ from Direct Payment cards in that the money is actually stored on the card... not in the bank account.  As with coins and bills, losing the card means losing the money.

<P>At the moment, a number of different approaches are in the works, but there are two basic types:

<P><B>Stored value card (SVC)</B>

<P>This is the wallet of the future, and it could replace coins and traditional currency.

<P>Consumers transfer a certain amount of money to their cards at a bank or over the phone, just as they'd withdraw cash and put bills in their wallets.  

<P>For retailers, this means fast transactions and better cash flow.  The cardholder inserts the card to pay, the terminal deducts the purchase price from the chip, adds the amount to the retailer's sales record, and displays the amount remaining to the cardholder. 

<P><B>Smart Card</B>

<P>The SVC stores cash, and that's about it.  But other cards can also hold data and information, allowing for tracking, accountability and security.  A tamper-proof system called cryptography acts as a digital signature to discourage fraud or transaction interceptions, making it possible to use the card not only in direct transactions, but for payments in cyberspace.

<HR>
<P><H3><A NAME="q2">The Electronic Mall</A></H3>

<P>These advances in the way we pay make the "electronic mall" an even more viable way to buy and sell goods.  

<P>Everyone from booksellers to pizzerias have already offered their wares over the Internet, and you may have browsed the silicon halls yourself.  But while most payments are currently made by credit card numbers or by cheque, "CyberBucks", "ecash" and other network payment schemes are being tested.  And smart cards offer the potential for easy, secure transactions.

<P>When you can pay electronically, ordering and paying for goods on the Internet is easy... and you can bring an entire world of new customers to your door without many of the costs traditionally associated with doing business in retail.

<P>Before long, you may find yourself "setting up shop" at a web site where users come to browse for goods and services... at 3 a.m.  Of course, you don't need to have staff on hand.  The shoppers take their time, pick out what they want, pay for it electronically, and you simply arrange to ship the goods.

<H2>Taking the work out of credit card processing</H2>

<P>Know your options, and you can save time and improve your cash flow.


<P>Credit card transactions can mean hours of processing time and balance reconciliation, right?  Not anymore.  New methods make it easier, save staff time, and get the money in your account faster.

<P>When it comes to reducing the time and effort it takes to get  your credit card receipts to the bank, an <B>electronic data transfer system (EDT)</B> can significantly improve your processing time over other less automated ways of processing and depositing (e.g. paper based systems, electronic files or magnetic tapes.)

<P>Choosing to move your funds electronically through an EDT system can help you streamline the way you work and can give you access to funds, on average, twice as fast as with less automated systems.  

<P><A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/merchvisa/services/greenkey.html">Draft capture terminals</A> let you put your old manual imprinter under the counter for use only as a backup.  

<P>A terminal frees staff from calling in for authorization; a swipe of the customers credit card does it for you.  Of course, that means your customer speeds through the line quicker, too.  Better yet, the money's in your account by the end of the day, without the time-consuming chore of filling out deposit summaries, and all the risk of error that entails.

<P>Sending in sales drafts can also lead to chargebacks through processing operator error.  If your merchant description is mis-keyed, the customer may dispute the payment.  Automatic transactions eliminate this problem.

<P>You can also keep better records with a daily transaction register -- a detailed report that lists each sale and the amount of the transaction.

<P>If you're in the restaurant business, you might consider a <A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/merchvisa/services/customized.html">special draft capture termina</A>l.  When your servers receive a credit card for payment, the terminal automatically authorizes the amount plus a gratuity.  This means there's no need to re-authorize the amount after the customer fills in the tip.<HR>

<H2>Credit Card Fraud</H2>
<H3><I>An ounce of prevention...<BR>is worth millions of dollars every year!</I></H3>
<HR>
<P>Credit card fraud hurts everyone. Today, it is the single most important issue facing the financial community. Last year, credit card fraud cost Canadian financial institutions over $73 million. But all Canadians pay for this crime. How? Through higher prices and service charges.
<P>As Paul Facciol, Director of Card Services Security at the Canadian Bankers Association, sees it, "That's why retailers and financial institutions have to work together to ensure front-line staff understand the problem and take precautions to curb credit card fraud."
<H3>A few Card Tricks ...</H3>
<P>"Criminals come in all shapes and sizes," says Facciol. "So it is virtually impossible to detect a perpetrator. Fortunately, there are a number of ways of identifying counterfeit or altered VISA Cards." 
<H3>For example ...</H3>
<UL>
<LI>A three-dimensional holograph of a dove in flight: 
On a counterfeit VISA Card, the holographic image may be of inferior quality, or may not change colour when the Card is viewed from different angles. 
<LI>The four-digit number above the Cardholder 
number: This is the issuing bank's identification number - and should match the first four digits of the embossed Card number. 
<LI>The embossed 'V' symbol: This distinctive symbol 
is preceded by an embossed C, B or P, depending on the type of Card. If it is not there - the Card 
is a fake.
<LI>The signature panel: The signature panel bears 
the repeated imprint of the wordmark 'VISA.' 
A blank or damaged signature panel could mean 
a stolen or counterfeit Card. Always compare 
the signature on the signed sales draft to the 
one on the Card's signature panel. You are not obliged to accept an unsigned Card.
</UL>
Also, be on the lookout for irregularities in embossed letters. Differing type styles or sizes, crooked lines, or unusual spacing or ghosting of letters - these clues all point to a stolen, and altered, VISA Card. 
<H3>Chargeback counterattack</H3>
<P>To help prevent a disputed transaction from being charged back to you, you must prove two things - that your customer (the Cardholder) and their 
Card were present at the time of the transaction. The proof: a signed sales draft, printed at the 
time of the transaction. 
<P>Occasionally, you must take precautions, even 
if your terminal has a printer or your ECR automatically prints VISA receipts. If you experience a printing problem and your ECR 
does not produce a printed receipt, you need your customer's signature to prove they were present. 
<P>If your terminal or ECR is down, and you receive 
a telephone authorization, or there is a problem 
with the Card's magstripe, you must key the Card number into the terminal for authorization, and 
you must also be able to prove that the Card was present at the time of the transaction.
<P>In such instances, the best 
way to protect yourself from 
a chargeback is to get a 
signed draft, using a manual 
imprinter. This proves 
without a doubt that both 
Card and Cardholder were 
present at the time of the 
transaction.

<H3><A NAME="code10">Code 10 -</A> <BR>
all the help you need </H3>
<P>If for any reason you suspect a Card is fraudulent, 
or a transaction suspicious, just call your TD VISA Centre and request a Code 10 authorization. 
This special procedure is designed to alert your VISA Centre without putting you in any danger - or alarming your customer. Remain calm. Hold 
the Card in your hand. And a VISA Centre representative will ask a series of easy-to-answer 
yes-or-no questions pertaining to the Card. Simply follow the instructions given to you over the phone. If there is a problem, you may be asked to keep the Card, and instruct the customer to call the issuing bank. If you are threatened in any way, return the Card to the customer. 
<P>By being aware of the problems, and taking precautions, you will make fraud difficult for 
would-be perpetrators - and substantially 
reduce your potential chargeback liability.

<H2>Keeping fraud prevention top-of-mind</H2>
by Harley Wittick, Senior Security Officer, TD Bank
<H3><I>Credit Card fraud in Canada is growing at an alarming rate.</I></H3>
<HR>
<P>Though this type of fraud may be a fact of life, there are ways to curb its impact on our economy - and protect your organization. Combatting fraud starts with you, the Merchant, and your front-line staff. Here are things you 
can do to keep fraud prevention top-of-mind:
<H3>Educate... </H3>
<P>your staff about what to look for when examining a Card. Make sure they are aware of the appropriate measures to follow should they encounter a counterfeit or stolen Card. TD Bank will be happy to provide you and your employees with reference materials.
<H3>Establish... </H3>
<P>clear procedures for staff to follow when performing Credit Card transactions. Make sure this includes checking the signature on the back of the Card with the signed sales draft.
<H3>Listen... </H3>
<P>to employee questions and concerns. If employees are worried about what to do when they encounter a suspicious Card, try role-playing. Satisfy yourself that they are comfortable with, and understand, <A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/merchvisa/contact/fraud.html#code10">Code 10 authorization procedures</A>. 
<H3>Review... </H3>
procedures on a regular basis. Ensure new employees understand and follow the established procedures.

<H2>Reducing Chargebacks</H2>
<HR>
<P>A customer going through their VISA statement notices a charge they don't recognize. Perhaps the date on the charge does not match their records ... or they are not familiar with the name of the company or the location listed on the charge. Whatever the reason for their concern, it can prompt a cardholder to call their financial institution to question the charge. Unfortunately, in such situations, merchants can end up with a chargeback ... even when a charge is legitimate. Fortunately, there are ways to protect yourself from footing the bill. <P>
At TD VISA, we're committed to providing you with the best in customer service. And we understand that chargebacks are one of your  biggest concerns. "That's why we're always on the look-out for ways of reducing the possibility of an item being charged back to you," says Liza Reyes, Assistant Manager, Accounting and Administration at TD VISA. <P>
<H3>What you can do!</H3>
Here are five things you can do to make it easier to respond to Retrieval Requests and help reduce chargebacks:
<OL>
<LI>Respond within eight days of receiving a request for copy.
<LI>Make and keep copies of any original sales drafts forwarded in response to a request for copy.
<LI>Keep all VISA drafts on file - by date -  for one year from the date of the transaction, for easy retrieval of sales drafts.
<LI>Deposit all paper VISA receipts within five business days of the transaction (if you deposit paper drafts manually).
<LI>Close batches daily, if your terminal requires a batch close. This makes for better reconciliation and better cash flow.
</OL>

<H2>Right on target!</H2>
By Richard Talbot - Managing Director of Thomas Consultants International Inc.
<H3><I>In the 90s, the name of the retail game is 'Target Marketing.' For some, the concept is intimidating. But as many successful retailers have discovered, getting started may be easier than you think!</I></H3>
<HR>Today's consumers are faced with more choices than ever before ... not only in terms of what to buy, but where to buy. It doesn't matter whether you operate a 200,000 square-foot store or a 100 square-foot kiosk, concentrating your marketing efforts on identifiable existing customers and prime prospects will pay dividends. <P>
There have been more changes in the retail environment in the past ten years than in the last one thousand! Canadian retailers face increasingly sophisticated competitors who build on basic techniques of target marketing and effectively promote their goods and services to new and existing customers. Unfortunately, many shopkeepers still follow 'pre-retail revolution' business practices, and dilute their already limited advertising budgets by attempting to market to everyone. <P>
Today, it's critical to understand who your best customers are, and to use this knowledge to reach both existing customers and prime prospects. Here are three simple steps to help get you started:<P>
<H3>Record each customer's spend, visit date and postal code </H3>
This is not as complicated as it sounds. Many retailers do this routinely. You already capture two out of three pieces of the information you need ... all you need to ask for is the postal code. Even if your check-out  seems too busy, make it part of your routine. The information you gather at the point of sale is worth the effort.
<H3>Group 'spends' by postal code </H3>
You can do this manually, or with the help of a simple computer spread sheet. If possible, also take the date into account when grouping spends. Then, rank postal codes from highest to lowest in terms of dollars spent. Once complete, you'll have identified which postal codes spend the most money in your store ... and on which days of the week (or month)! 
<H3>Get ready to Target Market</H3> 
Based on the assumption that the people who live close by your best customers have similar lifestyles and, if they knew about you, would also spend money on similar products and services, focusing your marketing efforts on those specific postal codes should result in more sales. 
<H3>A simple strategy that pays off </H3>
Applying the findings of even the most simplistic postal code tracking system to your marketing efforts is a strategy that really pays off. Learning about your best customers, and targeting them and others in neighborhoods with similar demographics and lifestyles will give you the highest return on your advertising dollars, and help build your business in an increasingly competitive retail environment.

<H2>Payroll deductions made simple</H2>
<H3><I>No more special trips to the bank ... special trips to the post office ... or direct dealings with Revenue Canada! Now, you can pay your monthly Payroll Source Deductions by phone, with TD Business Bankline.</I></H3>
<hr><H3>Three simple steps</H3>
Now Business Bankline customers can take care of their payroll deductions in three simple steps, any time of the day or night. "Using a touchtone phone, customers enter their payment amount, the number of employees and the total amount of their gross payroll," says David Koa, TD Business Bankline Product Manager.<P>
Soon, customers will be able to pay Payroll Source Deductions with their PC, using EDI (electronic data interchange). "Businesses will soon have the added flexibility of using either a PC or phone to pay their monthly source deductions," says David.

<H2>Direct Payment Shopping a hit with consumers</H2>
<H3><I>For millions of consumers, Direct Payment Shopping is an exciting and convenient payment option. In 1994, 70 per cent of all retail transactions were in cash and cheques. &quot;That spells  tremendous opportunity,&quot; says Fred Harris, General Manager of Interac Association. &quot;Wherever it has been introduced, it's really caught on. It makes great sense.&quot;</I></H3>
<HR><H3>Making sense for consumers...</H3>
<P>For consumers, Direct Payment Shopping often makes more sense than cheques or cash. And for younger customers, who may not qualify for credit cards, this is a very popular option. It offers tremendous flexibility - shopping excursions take far less planning because consumers can access their funds right at the point of sale. What's more, Direct Payment Shopping is...
<P><B><I>Fast... </I></B>less time is spent waiting for cheque verification, or searching for suitable identification 
<P><B><I>Safe... </I></B>no need to carry large sums of cash
<P><B><I>Easy... </I></B>by giving consumers immediate access to their bank accounts, Direct Payment Shopping cuts down on bank machine visits
<P><B><I>Accurate...</I></B> customers get a detailed description of each transaction at the point of sale, and on their bank statement 
<P><B><I>Cost-effective... </I></B>
with fees that are comparable to those charged for writing a cheque, and no Interac or ABM charges, Direct Payment Shopping means great value
<H3>And dollars for merchants</H3>
<P>&quot;Direct Payment Shopping is a real plus for shoppers,&quot; says Ian Cochran of Monro's Books, in Victoria BC. &quot;We've often watched people put a book back because they didn't have the cash to pay for it. That's not as big a factor with Direct Payment Shopping.&quot; 
<P>With fast and easy access to funds enabling consumers to make emergency purchases, Interac Association is predicting at least a 75 per cent increase in transactions in 1995. &quot;Consumers don't have to go looking for a bank machine, or worry about having the right credit card,&quot; says Fred Harris. &quot;And for retailers it's a great way of closing a sale. It's really a win/win situation.&quot; 
<P>Direct Payment Shopping is now available nationwide. As far as Fred Harris and others are concerned this spells major opportunity for Canadian retailers. &quot;More and more people will be choosing this payment option,&quot; says Harris. &quot;It's one of the biggest retail events in years.&quot;

<h2>Your Tailored Investment Portfolio Guide</h2>
<center><h4>Expiry Date: February 28, 1997</h4></center>

<P>Our exclusive Wealth Allocation Model is a three step guide to building an investment portfolio tailored to your personal needs and objectives.

<P>Please answer the following questions to determine your Investment Objectives. When you are finished, click <b><i>Submit</i></b>. Your Investor Profile and Asset Mix will be presented to you automatically. Then you will be able to select the pre-structured portfolio that's right for you.

<P> Please Note: If you are not in a position to accept any risk to your investment, we recommend that you consider either Government of Canada T-Bills, Money Market Strips, Guaranteed Investment Certificates or our Canadian T-Bill Fund. There is no need to continue with this questionnaire. Click <a href="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/">here</a> to return to the TD Home page.

<HR>


<P><A NAME="q1"><B>1. I've got a great idea for a business, but I don't know how to start it up.  Who can I contact to give me some advice?</B>
</A>
<P>Here are a few options:

<P>GOVERNMENT<BR>
Contact the Business Service Centre's Communications Branch at Industry Canada for information and counselling on the Department's programs and services.  The main office is located at:

<P>1 Front Street West<BR>
4th Floor<BR>
Dominion Public Building<BR>
Toronto, Ontario  M5J 1A4<BR>

<P>Your provincial government will also have information services available.

<P>BOOKS:<BR>
Of course, there are also lots of publications on the subject.  Look for books which were written for Canada and are current (particularly if they cover tax and accounting information).  Scan the contents and index page to see how the information relates to your business.

<P>MENTORS:<BR>
This is one of your best sources of information.  Find a mentor in a similar business, someone who'll give you advice and support based on his or her experience.

<P>CONSULTANTS:<BR>
Business consultants can help you at every stage of your business, for a price.  Contact the:

<P>Institute of Certified Management Consultants<BR>
121 Bloor Street East<BR>
Suite 805<BR>
Toronto, Ontario<BR>
M4W 3M5<BR>
(416) 963-9680<BR>

<P><A NAME="q2"><B>2. What government permits do I need before I start up a small business?</B></A>

<P>You may require a municipal license to operate in your locality, and you'll also have to comply with local zoning and bylaw regulations.  Check with your municipal licensing board, commission or bylaw officer to make sure you're on track.  Depending on the type of business you're running, you may also need things like tourist establishment licenses, liquor licenses, and delivery/transport licenses.  Contact the provincial ministry or board responsible.

<P><A NAME="q3"><B>3. Do I need to register my name or logo?</B></A>

<P>If you're a professional running a sole proprietorship, you can run the business under your name and you don't need to register it.  Otherwise, you'll have to register your name with the appropriate provincial ministry.  This doesn't protect you from others using your name.  You could register your name and trademark under the Trade Marks Act, which provides evidence of ownership.  Contact your lawyer or get a copy of the Act and Rules from:

<P>Supply & Services Canada<BR>
Publishing Centre<BR>
Hull, Quebec  K1A 0S9<BR>
(819) 997-2560<BR>

<P><A NAME="q4"><B>4. All my friends recommend I hire a lawyer to help me start up my business, but I don't really want to pay for one.  Do I really need a lawyer to get started?</B></A>

<P>Trying to do your own legal work is usually an inefficient use of your time.  And while you might get by without one, a lawyer with experience in small business can offer sound advice and provide invaluable research.  If you're closing a partnership agreement, an incorporation, or the purchase of a business, a lawyer is essential.

<P><A NAME="q5"><B>5. Hiring an accountant seem to be a waste of money given my limited budget.  How important is an accountant?</B></A>

<P>A bookkeeper, accounting program and helpful bank services can take care of the nitty gritty of accounting.  But for tax advice, forward-looking planning, and regular interpretation of your financial status, an accountant is highly valuable.

<P><A NAME="q6"><B>6. I decided to start up a restaurant and want to set up a location?  What are my options?  </B></A>

<P>You can either lease or buy.  A surplus of retail and commercial space may give you the opportunity for some good leasing rates and arrangements, but owning might also be to your advantage.  It could provide you with: tax benefits on interest, capital appreciation of the property, equity buildup in the property, the potential to lease space for additional revenue, and greater control over the property. Whatever option you choose, a reputable commercial/industrial real estate firm will be an invaluable resource. 

<P><A NAME="q7"><B>7. I'm tired of the commute into work every day and want to spend more time with my family.  Should I set up my business in my home?</B></A>

<P>It depends on your business, your personality and the layout of your home.  Many businesses can be run effectively from home.  As long as zoning permits and you have the space, you can save commuting time, write off a portion of your mortgage interest as an expense and spend more time with your family.  The flip side is you never really leave the office, you may be easily distracted and space/employee requirements may grow over time, forcing you out.  For information on this approach, contact:

<P>Canadian Association of Home-Based Business<BR>
#310, 1070 West Broadway<BR>
Vancouver, BC  V6H 1E7<BR>
(604) 736-4627<BR>

<P>or

<P>Home Business Network<BR>
272 Highway 5, RR1<BR>
St. George, Ontario  N0E 1N0<BR>
(905) 448-4001<BR>

<P><A NAME="q8"><B>8. I'm going to be importing/exporting.  What permits do I need?  How do duties and taxes work?</B></A>

<P>We could write megabytes.  A couple good resources:

<P>Canadian Export Association<BR>

<P><A NAME="q10"><B>10. I'm starting a business with my friend.  Do we need a formal agreement?</B></A>

<P>If you're planning on sharing responsibilities, resources, profits and liabilities, you should form a partnership, and set out your agreement in writing.  Consult a lawyer on the terms of the agreement, including what course will be followed should one person want to dissolve the partnership.

<P><A NAME="q11"><B>11. What are the differences between a sole proprietorship, partnership and incorporation?</B></A>

<P>Proprietorship<BR>
This is the simplest form of business organization, and usually involves one person (or possibly a spouse-team).  It can be operated under your name without registration, has low start-up costs, and has certain tax advantages (such as writing off losses against other employment income.)  However, you have unlimited liability: claims against the company can be made against your personal assets. 

<P>Partnership<BR>
This is an agreement between two or more people to share in responsibilities, profits and losses of the business.  It's pretty easy to form, and means you can share start-up costs.  Legally, there's not much difference between a partnership and a proprietorship, except that EACH partner has unlimited liability, and the actions of any partner bind the others.  Trust and confidence are the hallmarks of good partnerships.

<P>Incorporation<BR>
By incorporating, your company becomes a legal entity separate from you and its officers, directors and shareholders.  So liability is limited to the assets of the company; not your personal assets.  You may get additional tax advantages, particularly as a small business, and unlike proprietorships or partnerships, the business continues after your death.  However, this method costs more to start up, and regulations, restrictions and record keeping become more complex.

<P><A NAME="q12"><B>12. What's the difference between Inc., Co. and Ltd.?</B></A>

<P>A limited company or corporation is an incorporated business.  And all these terms refer to incorporated companies.

<P><A NAME="q13"><B>13. What's a limited partnership?</B></A>

<P>A limited partnership means a partner is liable only to the extent that he or she has contributed capital to the business.  Limited partners are often investors and can't act on behalf of the company; once they do, they become general partners.  It's actually a rare situation in small business.

<P><A NAME="q14"><B>14. When should I incorporate?</B></A>

<P>When you think you need the advantages of incorporation, such as its tax advantages, perpetual existence, and limited liability.

<P>You might also consider incorporating when you need outside investment.  Since incorporation means investors don't automatically acquire responsibility for the actions of the company, they're easier to find.

<P>Professional advice will help you determine when incorporation is to your advantage.

<P><A NAME="q15"><B>15. How do I incorporate?</B></A>

<P>If you're going to do business primarily in one province, you should probably incorporate provincially and file with the provincial ministry.  If you're going to operate or have branches in other provinces you may want to incorporate federally.  In that case, file with:

<P><A NAME="q16"><B>16. I'd like to purchase an existing or proven business.  Where can I find a suitable operation?</B></A>

<P>Keep your eyes open.  Opportunities to purchase a business may lie close to home: the owner of a company you already do business with might be getting ready to retire and sell the business.  A business broker can also help you track down a suitable business.  But in all cases, make sure you determine why the business is for sale, what its future is, and what it's really worth.  A professional appraisal can save you thousands of dollars.

<P><A NAME="q17"><B>17. A friend of mine suggested I look into franchises.  What exactly is a franchise?</B></A>

<P>What it's not, is a guaranteed get-rich quick business.  But it can be one of the best ways to launch a successful enterprise.  When you buy a franchise, you purchase a business which operates under the name and image of a large company (much like a chain operation).  The idea is that you get the best of both worlds: the freedom of running an independent business and the security of working for a big company.  But the relative freedom and security will vary depending on the franchise, and you should carefully investigate any franchise.  For more information, check your library for The Canadian Franchise Guide, by Douglas Gray and Norman Friend (McGraw-Hill Ryerson), or contact the:

<P><A NAME="q18"><B>18. I've got some savings earmarked for my business, and I figure it's enough to get me going.  Should I have any backup financing?</B></A>

<P>While some businesses require minimal overhead, most businesses demand a substantial investment, and it's better to be prepared at the beginning.  Determine what startup costs you'll have, including equipment, professional consultations, supplies, inventory, launch marketing, etc.  Prepare operating forecasts for income/expenses and cash flow for the first 12-month period, taking into account payroll, rents, taxes, advertising, and accounts receivable.  (Don't forget to pay yourself.)  With this information, take a hard look at your financial requirements.  Maybe your existing capital is enough to cover these costs, but this exercise will help you determine whether you need additional financing to proceed with confidence.

<P><A NAME="q19"><B>19. What's an income forecast?</B></A>

<P>It's an operating statement (usually covering a year) showing what you expect to earn.  It includes your operating costs, including financing costs, and your income from sales.  The result is your net profit. 

<P><A NAME="q20"><B>20. What's a cash flow forecast?</B></A>

<P>Most businesses operate seasonally, with busy periods and slow periods, leaving you cash-rich at times and cash-poor at others.  A cash flow statement helps you determine in advance whether you'll have enough cash to pay your bills, and when you'll need financing.  Prepare it a year in advance with monthly breakdowns.

<P><A NAME="q21"><B>21. I'll need additional funds to finance my start-up.  Where do I go for money?</B></A>

<P>You might think your best bet is to go after rich relatives or friends for financing.  But a few words of caution: any business investment should be made on the basis of a belief in the business's potential success; a favourite aunt should not loan you money because she likes you personally.  Secondly, there's no such thing as a "silent partner".  Whether it's obvious or not, as soon as you deposit that cheque, you're in a different relationship with the person who loaned you the money.  Is it worth risking your relationship?

<P>If you have a viable idea and sound research to back it up, you should explore outside sources.

<P>Banks provide a full range of services from loans to lines of credit, at reasonable rates of interest.  And since you'll be dealing with a financial institution at some point (for operating and deposit accounts), consolidating your dealings is often convenient and efficient. 

<P>Venture capitalists might help you with start-up funds, but they're often more interested in financing the rapid expansion of small businesses.  Be prepared to give them a stake in your business (a minority equity position and a share of profits) and a say in the running of the business.  

<P>Other, more complex, options include franchising your business, "private placement" (placing stock in your company with a few institutions), and going public.

<P><A NAME="q22"><B>22. If I go to the bank for financing, what will I need to provide my bank manager?</B></A>

<P>You need more than a good idea.  Your bank manager must be convinced of the viability of your idea and its potential for success, and you need to provide the research, projections and facts to back this up.  The forecasts that helped you determine startup financing form part of a business plan, which is an excellent tool to bring to the table.

<P><A NAME="q23"><B>23. What is a business plan, exactly?</B></A>

<P>It's a management tool that helps you achieve your goals, and it's really an essential step in any business.  It paints a portrait of your enterprise, past, present and future.  It should include:
<UL>
<LI> Business data, such as products, research results, marketing strategies, and management resumes.
<LI> Financial data, including statements and projections
<LI> Supporting data, including references, letters of intent from customers, etc.
<LI> A monitoring system, a method by which you'll continually examine results in terms of your projections, helping you modify and update plans as necessary. 
</UL>

<P><A NAME="q24"><B>24. Will the bank consider my personal finances when I apply for a loan?</B></A>

<P>They'll probably want to know whether you've invested your own funds in the business, and if not, why not.  But banks require security when it comes to business loans, and you may need to provide it in the way of real estate and equipment for term credits, or receivable and inventory for operating credits.

<P><A NAME="q25"><B>25. My accountant keeps talking about business ratios.  What are they?</B></A>

<P>Business ratios are used to evaluate the performance and financial health of your business.  Here are a few proven ratios:

<UL>
<LI> Current ratio:  Divide you total current assets by your total current liabilities.  This ratio helps you determine your short-term liquidity.  As a rule of thumb, your ratio should be 2:1.  

<LI> Quick ratio:  Divide your Cash, accounts receivable and other quick assets by your current liabilities.  This ratio is used to determine how well your creditors are protected. A good rule of thumb is to have a ratio of 1:1.

<LI> Operating expense ratio:  Divide any operating expense by net sales. When compared to industry averages, these ratios help determine where you could be more efficient in your spending.

<LI> Debt to equity:  Divide you total debt by your total equity.  This ratio measures your financial health, and lets you know how far your debt is extended.

<LI> Return on investment:  Divide profit by net worth to determine what return you're getting from your original investment.  Like an interest rate, it appears as a percentage.

<LI> Sales to inventory:  Divide your total sales by the retail value of your inventory.  This measures your  inventory turnover and when compared to industry averages, indicates how efficient your inventory management is.

<LI> Net profit to sales: Divide your net profits by your sales to calculate your net profit margins.
</UL>
<P>Your accountant can help you compare your ratios to industry averages in similar sectors.


<P><A NAME="q26"><B>26. Tracking expenses is a cumbersome exercise.  Are there better ways than a shoebox?</B></A>

<P>A computer spreadsheet or accounting package makes it easy to enter your expenses.  This gives you the data you need at year end, and you can provide disk or hard copies to your accountant.  The trick is setting up a regular schedule in which you enter your expenses on a weekly or monthly, or -- at most -- quarterly basis.  That way, they don't pile up and become daunting, and it means you're prepared for periodic tax reporting, such as for the GST.

<P>Many banks offer a wide variety of products to help minimize the hassles of bookkeeping.  These services range from a detailed monthly report of your transactions to online access to your bank accounts.

<P><A NAME="q27"><B>27. Business is good.  I'm hiring people to help me expand.  Are there any government regulations I need to know about?</B></A>

<P>Labour regulations vary from province to province, and you should check with your provincial labour ministry to find out more.  They'll also fill you in on such issues as minimum wage, vacation pay, occupational health and safety, etc.  You should also contact your provincial worker's compensation board.

<P><A NAME="q28"><B>28. Where's the best place to find new employees?</B></A>

<P>Keep your ear to the ground.  Your competition might have some of the best employees, and these employees may be looking for a move.  They're trained and knowledgeable.  But aside from raiding your competitors, you'll have to advertise.  Look to trade publications and newsletters before general interest publications.  They'll be cheaper and more targeted.  But be prepared for a flood of resumes.  After the weeding and before the interview, follow up on references.  Talk to both the applicant's supervisor and people who worked FOR the applicant.

<P><A NAME="q29"><B>29. I don't get along with my partner anymore and I want to get out of the business.  What are my options?</B></A>

<P>If you leave the company, your partnership is automatically dissolved, and you'll have to come to a settlement (which might depend on your partnership agreement).  Perhaps you've allowed for a buyout option with a pre-arranged set of criteria to help you determine price.  Failing that, you'll have to deal with your partner till you come to a mutually agreeable solution, and professional advice might be worthwhile.

<hr>

<P><B><A NAME="1">1.  What fees are charged on my accounts?</A></B>

	
<P>Fees are charged in different ways.  Usually you can decide whether you want to work on a per transaction basis (a fee charged on individual transactions that you complete, for example for withdrawals, transfers or cheques) or if you want to work within a packaged fee or service plan (one monthly fee covering a wide range of banking activities). 
<P>To determine which of these options is best for you, look over your bank statements and cheque registers.   How many cheques a month do you write on average?   How many bills can you now pay without charges?   How often do you use your bank card for direct payments?  
<P>If you find that the number of transactions you complete in an average month is substantial then it might make sense to consider a service plan that caps your monthly fee at a pre-determined level.  Alternately, you may find you'd prefer paying fees on a per transaction basis, but you'd like to reduce your total monthly fees.  In this case one way to minimize the fees you pay is to work with an account that does not charge service fees as long as a minimum balance is maintained.  By taking a little time to <A HREF="select/index.html">evaluate your needs</A> now you'll save money in the long run.

<P><B><A NAME="2">2.  Is there a way to avoid or reduce the fees I pay?</B></A>

<P>Certain fees can be avoided or reduced.   On automated transactions, such as
ABM's, INTERAC  Direct Payment shopping, telephone banking and pre-authorized
payments, most banks charge reduced rates compared to the fee charged for writing
a cheque.  Some banks offer no-charge fee levels if you maintain a minimum
monthly balance in the account. For example, with a minimum balance of $1000 in
your account, the bank may waive charging you withdrawal fees. <P>If you tend to
use your bank to complete numerous types of transactions,  a <A
HREF="../prodserv/prod/budget.html">service plan</A> can be a good alternative to consider. 
Using a packaged fee approach, you can put a cap on fees by paying one flat
amount monthly to receive a bundle of services that can include unlimited
chequing, unlimited withdrawals and deposits and various other services such as
bill payments, telephone banking, no-charge travellers cheques, etc.

<P><B><A NAME="3">3.  What If I write a cheque which exceeds my account
balance?</B></A>

<P>If you write a cheque which exceeds your account balance, your bank has the
right to return it unpaid to the bank of the person or company who cashed it. 
This situation can be
embarrassing when it happens by accident. Also, you will be charged a Not
Sufficient Funds (NSF) cheque return fee by your bank. 

<P>One way to avoid this
is to obtain approval for <!--<A HREF="../lending/tdover.html">-->"overdraft
protection"<!--</A>--> from your bank.  You may be approved for overdraft protection in
varying amounts based on your credit standing. It is essentially a loan to you in
the form of a line of credit. i.e., any cheque which exceeds your account balance
will be paid by your bank up to a authorized amount.  This means that funds are
made available to you if you need them but you are not charged interest until and
unless you overdraw the account and need to access the funds.  There is usually a
monthly fee of $1-$2 charged for this service in addition to any interest
charges.

<P><B><A NAME="4">4.  I once couldn't immediately withdraw cash on a cheque I deposited because a "hold" was put on the cheque.  What does this mean?</B></A>

	<P>A "hold" means that your account has been credited with the value of the cheque but that you do not have the ability to access the funds until the cheque has been processed by the bank it is drawn on.  This doesn't mean that your bank doesn't trust you, it only means that your bank needs assurances that the account of the person who wrote the cheque has sufficient funds.  &quot;Holding&quot; the cheque allows the cheque to be processed by the bank of the person who wrote the cheque and for your bank to receive any notice of insufficient funds.  Each bank has its own policy on the time limit of "holds&quot; and under what circumstances it will place a hold on a cheque.

<P><B><A NAME="5">5.  How do I stop payment against a cheque I have written?
</B></A>
	
<P>To stop payment against a cheque, contact your branch before the cheque has been presented for payment.  If you wait until after the cheque is processed through your account, it is too late.  When you ask for a stop payment, you will be asked to provide such details as the cheque amount, the date appearing on the cheque,  the payee's name, and the cheque number.  As part of arranging for a stop payment your bank will charge a fee for this  service. 
	
<P>Alternately, find out what minimum balance is required for no fees.  If you have that much in savings, especially with savings interest paid at a low rate, then it may be worth putting into chequing and having your account be fee-free.

<P><B><A NAME="6">6.  I'm moving.  What is the best way to deal with switching my accounts to a different city?
</B></A>
	
<P>Ask your bank to help you.  You can maintain your account at the home branch for a period of time, but let them know of your change of address.  Your statement will be sent to your new address.  Some banks, may offer <A HREF="select/move.html">special moving services</A> that are designed to help make the transfer of your financial affairs to a bank branch nearest your new address as painless as possible.

<P><B><A NAME="7">7.  Can anyone open a bank account?</B></A>

	
<P>Yes.  You will be asked for suitable identification to open an account, such as a drivers license.  As well, a Social Insurance number will also be required for tax reporting purposes.
<P>Bank accounts can be held in your name alone, jointly with one or more persons, or in trust for someone else.
<P>Children under legal age (minors) can open their own bank accounts, and in fact most banks have <A HREF="select/first.html">special accounts</A> to encourage savings among young people.


<P><B><A NAME="8">8.  What is the minimum amount of money I need to open a bank account?</B></A>
	
<P>There is no minimum amount of money required to open a bank account, but it's a
good idea to make a deposit that will help cover the cost of such things as your
cheque order.
<P>When you are contemplating opening a new account, take a little time to
evaluate how you want to bank, in terms of such things as the account balances
you maintain and the number of monthly transactions you will have .  There are so
many different options to choose from now, that determining how you want to bank
is the first step in finding the services that provide you with the best fit.

<P>You can access <A HREF="select/index.html">TD's Account Selector</A> directly from this site.	

<P><B><A NAME="9">9.  What is INTERAC  Direct Payment?</B></A>
	
<P>INTERAC  Direct Payment is a Canadian debit payment system which allows you to use your bank card to pay for purchases at retailers.    The transaction links directly into your bank account and funds are automatically withdrawn to cover the amount of the purchase.   The  personal identification number, or PIN,  assigned to your card is your personal code that no one else knows.  It is the PIN that ensures that only  you can access your account. 

<P><B><A NAME="10">10.  Are there advantages to using INTERAC  Direct Payment?</B></A>

<P>There are many advantages to using INTERAC Direct Payment versus using cash, cheques or credit cards.
<P>It is safer than carrying large sums of money and allows your money to stay in your account earning interest until the minute you transfer it.  It is easier to use than cheques since no additional ID needs to be provided.  And unlike a credit card, there is no bill to pay at the end of the month with INTERAC Direct Payment.

<P><B><A NAME="11">11.  I'm concerned that directly accessing my account to pay for something is very risky.  What assurances do I have that the money in my account is safe?</B></A>
	
<P>Directly accessing your account using INTERAC Direct Payment at a merchant
location is like accessing your accounts through an Automated Banking Machine. 
Your personal identification number, or PIN, protects your card from being used
by others.  Without it, the card cannot be activated. Remember to use these
recommended safeguards when using your bank card:<ul>
<li>Keep your PIN confidential.  Do not write it down and keep it in your wallet or purse.
<li>Don't let others see you key in your PIN when you are using the card.  
<li>If you pick your own PIN, avoid combinations such as birthdays, phone numbers, age, social insurance numbers, etc.
</ul>
<P><B><A NAME="12">12.  Are there any fees when I use INTERAC Direct Payment?</B></A>
	
<P>Generally, there are no fees when you use your bank card for INTERAC Direct Payment as long as you maintain a minimum &quot;no-charge&quot; balance level in your account or if you have a service plan that  includes such transaction charges.  The transaction charge that most banks apply to a direct payment is comparable to what would likely apply for a withdrawal fee.
<P><B><A NAME="13">13.  How does telephone banking work?</B></A>

<P>Banking by telephone is easy and saves time because you can do it in spare moments at home or at the office.  In fact, if you forget to take care of  finances before leaving town, most banks provide a 1-800 service accessible throughout North America.
<P>Basically, for automated service you use the telephone buttons to get into your account, and by responding to pre-recorded "prompts", you can make certain transactions.  You can transfer funds between deposit accounts, make history enquiries and pay bills without getting up from your chair.  And even if you don't have a touch tone phone you can still access the telephone banking service through on-line telephone agents who can carry out your transactions. 

<P><B><A NAME="14">14.  What fees do I pay to do banking by telephone?
</B></A>
	
<P>The fees you pay for telephone banking depend on the arrangement you make with your bank.
<P>You may decide to take an all-inclusive package and pay a flat fee.  If you choose not to operate within a special package arrangement, there may be a handling fee for some telephone transactions in addition to withdrawal fees. Agent assisted transactions are more costly than touch tone phone automated transactions. 

<P><B><A NAME="15">15.  What are the advantages of banking by phone?</B></A>

<P>There are many advantages of banking by phone.<ul>
<li>It doesn't matter how hot, cold or wet the weather is.  You don't have to leave home to do your banking.
<li>You don't have to make a special trip to the bank to pay bills on time.
<li>You can make post dated payments so your money stays in your account, earning interest, until the moment the bill is paid.
<li>You don't pay for postage.
</ul>
	
<P><B><A NAME="16">16.  What services can I access with telephone banking?</B></A>

<P>You can transfer between any type of deposit account.  
<P>You can pay bills to utilities, your television cable company or most municipal taxes.  You can pay  bills to major retailers or your VISA   bill.  You can make balance enquiries or account activity enquiries.

<P><B><A NAME="17">17.  How does a joint account work?</B></A>

<P>With a joint account, any holder on the account may make a deposit.  For cheques and withdrawals, it is up to the account holders to agree whether any one of you alone may sign or whether more than one signature is required.  Also you must decide whether the account has what is known as "Right of Survivorship".  If it does even if one of the account holders dies money in the account may be withdrawn by the other account holder(s).

<P><B><A NAME="18">18.  Can I open a bank account for a newborn and start a savings plan for them?</B></A>
	
<P>Yes, you can.   The earlier in life that a person acquires assets, the more those assets will grow.
<P>The rule of compounding says that interest paid on principal, added to principal and left untouched will pile up to a sizeable amount over a period of years.
<P>Think of money saved early as a head start on an opportunity fund.  Eighteen years of savings is a substantial nest egg for university, marriage or a business venture.
<P>One thing to investigate if you do decide to open such an account is how tax attribution rules will affect you.

<P><B><A NAME="19">19.  What does budgeting mean?</B></A>

<P>Budgeting is a balancing act between income and expenses.  It helps you plan out your expenses and manage them in advance of paying them so you can always ensure that you ideally have more than enough money in reserve to cover your expenses.  Expenses can be itemized within categories (for example, housing, utilities, food, entertainment, transportation, insurance, personal care, vacation and savings could all be budget items)  and are outlined over the time period you intend to manage (say weekly, monthly or annually).
<P>Some expense items can be variable (ie. they don't occur on a regular and predictable basis) and some are the same every month.  Budget items are deducted from income.  In the ideal budget, there are savings after expenses.  The most basic of  budgets  balances income and expenses.  When expenses exceed income, you are spending your reserve savings, and action should be taken to cut expenses or increase income to restore the balance. 

<P><B><A NAME="20">20.  I hate budgeting.  What's the use of it?</B></A>
	
<P>Not everyone  enjoys budgeting.  But it is a tool to gain control over the
financial part of your life.  And finances are a key part of everyone's
life.

<P><B><A NAME="21">21.  I've never been able to stick to a budget.  What am I doing wrong?</B></A>

<P>It's not easy to stick to a budget.  You may have variable items like personal care, entertainment or department store purchases that rise and fall every month.  If you are consistently off budget, you need to take another look at the process.
<P>Are you being realistic?  You may have set savings goals that are too high.  Or you may have taken on expenses that are out of line with your income.  You may be willing to live this way, but your budget should reflect this choice with accurate numbers.
<P>Or are there areas where you could reduce expenses?  Perhaps the best use of a budget is in really letting you examine your expenses in order to separate the essentials from the not-so-essential. 

<P><B><A NAME="22">22.  What do I need for a successful budget?</B></A>

<P>The most important thing you need for a successful budget is the willpower to sit down and do it the first time.
<P>Give yourself time to think of all your monthly expenses.  Look in your cheque book and outline your typical bill payment schedule.  Put expenses on one side of the page.  On the other side, put your monthly income after taxes.
<P>Forecast your expenses and income month by month, one month to a page.  After a few months, you will find that  a pattern emerges and that projecting your spending  and planning for savings becomes easier and easier.   For an example of one possible approach to a budget plan, link to <A HREF="student/stbud.html">TD's Student Budget Planner</A>.
	
<P><B><A NAME="23">23.  What are the important factors I need to take into account in doing a budget?</B></A>

<P>When doing a budget, you must take into account many factors.
<P>Be thorough in evaluating your income and your expenses.  You may have hidden items in each category.  Items may look small, but if you add enough of them up, they can be sizable.
<P>Be honest.  Commit to recording every expense.  At the end of the month, your items should tally.
<P>Don't be too tough on yourself.  Life should contain a little enjoyment.  Don't use your budget just as a stick.  Put in a carrot, too. 
<P>Pay yourself first.  The most important budgeting concept to learn as early as possible is how to plan for savings.  As you consider all the expenses that you need to pay in any given month, always remember that paying yourself first should be at the top of the list.

<P><B><A NAME="24">24.  Are there different types of budgets?</B></A>

<P>Yes...budgets can differ and usually vary to reflect the specific needs people have at different stages of life.   Whether you are a student or a young person just  starting out on your career path, or you're in mid-life, or preparing for retirement, everyone has different financial requirements along the way and therefore needs different things from a budget plan.

<P>TD Bank's Overdraft Protection is a financial option that gives you real peace of mind, and can save you from the problems and the cost of overdrafts. Once you have been approved, if you ever run short of funds, Overdraft Protection will be there to cover you, up to your approved limit which could be as high as $5,000. Overdrafts should be paid within 60 days, and subsequent deposits to your account will automatically be applied to pay off the overdraft.

<P>This protection costs you just $1.10 per month, plus any interest on the
overdrawn amount. At that price, your protection can cost you less than the
service charges on just one NSF cheque. It also covers ATM transactions, and
<I>Interac</I> Direct Payments purchases.

<P>To apply for TD Overdraft Protection, download the TD application
form, provided here. (Please note the form is in Adobe(TM) Acrobat(TM)
format (.pdf) so you will need Adobe(TM) Acrobat(TM) to read it. If you do not
have Adobe(TM) Acrobat(TM), you can <A
HREF="http://www.adobe.com/acrobat/main.html">download it</A> from Adobe Systems
Incorporated.) 
<P>Complete and return the application to any TD Bank branch for fast processing.
Or for more information, <A HREF="mailto:greenline@tdbank.ca">e-mail us</A> (<A

<p><B>L</B>a retraite est l'un des grands objectifs financiers pour presque tous les Canadiens.
Certains attendent ce moment avec impatience, d'autres le voient venir avec
appr&eacute;hension, mais peu de gens y sont vraiment bien pr&eacute;par&eacute;s. Pour
&eacute;viter d'&eacute;puiser vos fonds avant la fin de vos jours - une
&eacute;ventualit&eacute; tr&egrave;s probable -, il est sage de commencer &agrave; planifier
d&egrave;s maintenant. 

<P><B>S</B>elon les experts, vous aurez besoin de 60 % &agrave; 80 % du revenu
r&eacute;alis&eacute; avant la retraite pour maintenir votre niveau de vie actuel une fois que
vous aurez cess&eacute; de travailler. Si vous avez peu de dettes, le pourcentage requis sera
relativement faible. Par contre, pour pratiquer des passe-temps dispendieux ou faire des
voyages, il vous faudra peut-&ecirc;tre un revenu beaucoup plus important. 

<P><B>M</B>&ecirc;me si nous pourrons probablement compter sur des prestations de
l'&Eacute;tat, nous devons cesser de penser que l'&Eacute;tat assurera notre subsistance pendant
la retraite. Votre r&eacute;gime de retraite d'entreprise - si vous en avez un - ne pourra non plus
subvenir &agrave; tous vos besoins. Si vous avez chang&eacute; souvent d'emploi ou si vous
n'avez pas travaill&eacute; &agrave; un certain moment pendant votre vie active, vous ne
pourrez peut-&ecirc;tre pas recevoir une pension compl&egrave;te. Pour la plupart des
Canadiens, environ la moiti&eacute; de leur revenu de retraite proviendra de leurs
&eacute;conomies personnelles.
<HR>
<H3>DE COMBIEN D'ARGENT AUREZ-VOUS BESOIN?</H3>
<B>I</B>l est beaucoup plus facile d'&eacute;pargner quand on sait exactement combien
&eacute;conomiser pour atteindre un objectif donn&eacute;. Remplissez la feuille de calcul
suivante pour conna&icirc;tre le montant que vous devez &eacute;pargner. Si vous avez besoin
d'aide, veuillez communiquer avec un sp&eacute;cialiste des placements &agrave; votre
succursale TD ou composez le num&eacute;ro de la Ligne directe sans frais qui figure
&agrave; la derni&egrave;re page.


<HR>
<H3>ATTEINDRE VOTRE OBJECTIF</H3>
<B>U</B>ne strat&eacute;gie efficace pour atteindre votre objectif en mati&egrave;re
d'&eacute;pargne-retraite consiste &agrave; investir des petits montants de fa&ccedil;on
r&eacute;guli&egrave;re. Il suffit de diviser en versements mensuels ou hebdomadaires le
montant que vous d&eacute;sirez &eacute;pargner chaque ann&eacute;e puis d'adh&eacute;rer
au Plan d'achat pr&eacute;autoris&eacute; TD. Vos versements sont
alors pr&eacute;lev&eacute;s automatiquement dans le compte de banque que vous
d&eacute;signez et investis dans l'un des 31 fonds mutuels sans frais d'acquisition Ligne Verte
que vous aurez choisi. Il est possible de modifier le montant, le fonds et la
p&eacute;riodicit&eacute; des achats en tout temps. 

<P><B>A</B>vec un Plan d'achat pr&eacute;autoris&eacute;, votre placement se met &agrave;
fructifier plus rapidement et vous n'avez pas &agrave; vous pr&eacute;occuper de trouver la
somme voulue &agrave; la veille de la date limite. Pour plus de renseignements, rendez-vous
&agrave; votre succursale TD ou composez le num&eacute;ro de la Ligne directe sans frais qui
figure &agrave; la derni&egrave;re page.
 
<p><B>S</B>i vous n'avez pas commenc&eacute; &agrave; vous pr&eacute;parer en vue de
la retraite, n'attendez plus. Il faut parfois se discipliner pour &eacute;tablir un programme et le
respecter; cependant, c'est un faible prix &agrave; payer pour s'assurer d'avoir des fonds
jusqu'&agrave; la fin de ses jours.

<h2>COMMENT APPR&Eacute;CIER LA TENUE D'UN FONDS</h2>

<h3>Le taux de rendement et le rendement sont les deux indicateurs les  plus utilis&eacute;s
pour &eacute;valuer la tenue des fonds mutuels. Mais ces chiffres sont peu
r&eacute;v&eacute;lateurs sur vos placements.

<i>Il importe donc de tenir compte des facteurs suivants lorsque vous &eacute;valuez vos
fonds.</i></h3>
<UL>
     <LI><A HREF="#q1">Rendement &agrave; long terme</A>
     <LI><A HREF="#q2">Comparaison de fonds semblables</A>
     <LI><A HREF="#q3">Indice de r&eacute;f&eacute;rence</A>
     <LI><A HREF="#q4">&Eacute;valuation de la volatilit&eacute;</A>
     <LI><A HREF="#q5">Comment calcule-t-on les rendements ?</A>
     <LI><A HREF="#q6">Classement de fonds Ligne Verte</A></ul>

<p><b>L</b>es valeurs unitaires et les rendements d'un fonds sont tr&egrave;s faciles &agrave;
obtenir. Il vous suffit de consulter les principaux quotidiens et les publicit&eacute;s; vous
pouvez aussi communiquer avec votre succursale ou la Ligne directe sans frais. Les rendements
fournis sont pour des p&eacute;riodes variant d'un mois &agrave; 10 ans. M&ecirc;me s'ils sont
bas&eacute;s sur la performance ant&eacute;rieure et ne sont aucunement garants de la
performance future, les rendements t&eacute;moignent de la comp&eacute;tence des
gestionnaires et peuvent &eacute;clairer les investisseurs.
<hr>
<A NAME="q1"><h3>Rendement &agrave; long terme -</h3></A>

<b>L</b>orsqu'un fonds affiche un rendement r&eacute;gulier &agrave; longue
&eacute;ch&eacute;ance, on en d&eacute;duit que son gestionnaire est capable de
d&eacute;gager un rendement constant dans la plupart des conditions du march&eacute;. Pour
r&eacute;ussir &agrave; long terme, il vaut mieux &ecirc;tre capable de r&eacute;duire au
minimum les pertes en p&eacute;riode de repli des march&eacute;s que de procurer un
rendement mirobolant lorsque les march&eacute;s sont &agrave; la hausse. Aussi faut-il se
m&eacute;fier des fonds dont le rendement &agrave; long terme fluctue
&eacute;norm&eacute;ment, car il leur faudra peut-&ecirc;tre des ann&eacute;es pour
&eacute;galer le rendement moyen. Par ailleurs, ne vous pr&eacute;occupez pas trop si un fonds
affiche de faibles rendements sur une p&eacute;riode inf&eacute;rieure &agrave; un an. Divers
facteurs pourraient avoir une incidence sur votre placement. Le rendement est plus
&eacute;loquent lorsqu'il couvre un cycle boursier complet d'au moins cinq ans. 
<hr>
<A NAME="q2"><h3>Comparaison de fonds semblables -</h3></A>

<b>P</b>our avoir une meilleure id&eacute;e du rendement relatif, comparez un fonds avec
d'autres fonds de m&ecirc;me cat&eacute;gorie. Les tableaux de fonds mutuels regroupent des
fonds semblables et pr&eacute;sentent les moyennes pour chaque cat&eacute;gorie. On dit d'un
fonds qu'il est de bonne qualit&eacute; lorsqu'il surpasse continuellement ceux de sa
cat&eacute;gorie.
 
<p><b>T</b>oute comparaison, pour &ecirc;tre &eacute;quitable, doit reconna&icirc;tre que les
fonds d'une m&ecirc;me cat&eacute;gorie diff&egrave;rent entre eux. Par exemple, les
gestionnaires de certains fonds d'actions canadiennes favorisent une gestion prudente, tandis que
d'autres cherchent activement &agrave; d&eacute;gager des plus-values. Un gestionnaire de
fonds privil&eacute;gie la valeur, tandis qu'un autre essaie de tirer profit des diverses
p&eacute;riodes du cycle boursier. Si vous ne connaissez pas les objectifs de placement du fonds
et la gestion pratiqu&eacute;e, renseignez-vous aupr&egrave;s de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; de
fonds mutuels ou consultez le prospectus. Ainsi, vous d&eacute;couvrirez peut-&ecirc;tre que
certains fonds aux rendements fort attrayants sont trop risqu&eacute;s pour vous.
<hr>
<A NAME="q3"><h3>Indices de r&eacute;f&eacute;rence -</h3></A>

<b>U</b>ne autre fa&ccedil;on d'&eacute;valuer un fonds consiste &agrave; le comparer
&agrave; un indice de r&eacute;f&eacute;rence pertinent. Il s'agit d'un indice important qui
refl&egrave;te le rendement d'un march&eacute; donn&eacute; et qui repr&eacute;sente le
niveau moyen de ce march&eacute;.  Par exemple, lorsqu'un fonds d'actions affiche un meilleur
rendement que son indice de r&eacute;f&eacute;rence, on dit qu'il d&eacute;gage un rendement
sup&eacute;rieur &agrave; la moyenne ou encore qu'il surpasse le march&eacute;.

<P><b>L</b>e cahier &eacute;conomique des principaux quotidiens renferme un certain
nombre d'indices de r&eacute;f&eacute;rence, ainsi que des tableaux sur le rendement. Pour
&eacute;tablir une bonne comparaison, assurez-vous que le fonds et l'indice tiennent compte du
r&eacute;investissement des distributions et qu'ils couvrent la m&ecirc;me p&eacute;riode de
rendement.
<hr>
<A NAME="q4"><h3>&Eacute;valuation de la volatilit&eacute; -</h3></A>

<b>L</b>'un des principes fondamentaux du placement veut que le potentiel de rendement
augmente &agrave; mesure que le risque s'accro&icirc;t. C'est d'ailleurs pour cette raison que les
rendements dans certaines cat&eacute;gories fluctueront plus que d'autres. Par exemple, un fonds
de croissance conna&icirc;tra vraisemblablement plus de hauts et de bas qu'un fonds
d'obligations d'&Eacute;tat. Pour aider les investisseurs &agrave; &eacute;valuer le risque, les
tableaux de fonds mutuels font souvent mention de la volatilit&eacute;. L'&eacute;cart-type et le
facteur b&ecirc;ta figurent parmi les autres indicateurs utilis&eacute;s.

<P><b>L'&eacute;cart-type</b> fait ressortir la variabilit&eacute; des rendements par rapport
&agrave; leur moyenne pour une p&eacute;riode donn&eacute;e. Plus la valeur est grande, plus
les rendements fluctuent et, par cons&eacute;quent, plus le risque est &eacute;lev&eacute;. Dans
le cas des obligations et des fonds obligataires, l'&eacute;cart-type mesure l'incidence qu'a sur les
prix la fluctuation des taux d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t. Pour calculer l'&eacute;cart-type, on tient
g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement compte des rendements des trois derni&egrave;res ann&eacute;es,
mais on peut aussi utiliser des p&eacute;riodes plus courtes. 

<p><b>Le facteur b&ecirc;ta</b> permet de mesurer le risque par rapport au march&eacute;
boursier. L'indice du march&eacute; constitue la norme g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement reconnue,
et on lui attribue une valeur b&ecirc;ta &eacute;gale &agrave; 1,0. Par cons&eacute;quent, si le
facteur b&ecirc;ta d'un fonds mutuel est inf&eacute;rieur &agrave; 1,0, celui-ci affiche une
volatilit&eacute; sous la moyenne par rapport &agrave; l'indice de r&eacute;f&eacute;rence pour
une p&eacute;riode donn&eacute;e. &Agrave; l'oppos&eacute;, si le facteur b&ecirc;ta est
sup&eacute;rieur &agrave; 1,0, le fonds est alors plus volatil que la moyenne. 

<p><b>U</b>ne fois que vous aurez bien saisi les notions de rendement historique et de
rendement relatif pour divers fonds mutuels, vous voudrez savoir comment se porte votre
portefeuille. Au moment d'&eacute;valuer vos placements, rappelez-vous que vos objectifs
financiers, votre seuil de risque et votre horizon de placement sont tout aussi importants que les
chiffres.
<HR>
<A NAME="q5"><h3> Comment calcule-t-on les rendements ? - </h3></A>

<h4>Taux de rendement total :</h4>
<b>V</b>ariation du prix unitaire d'un fonds mutuel sur une p&eacute;riode donn&eacute;e, en
supposant le r&eacute;investissement des distributions.

<h4>Taux de rendement compos&eacute; annuel moyen : </h4>
<b>V</b>ariation du prix unitaire d'un fonds mutuel sur une p&eacute;riode donn&eacute;e, en
supposant le r&eacute;investissement des distributions, divis&eacute; par le nombre
d'ann&eacute;es que comporte cette p&eacute;riode. &Eacute;tant donn&eacute; qu'il s'agit du
rendement annuel moyen pour la p&eacute;riode concern&eacute;e, cette valeur constitue un
moyen utile de mesurer le rendement type d'un fonds &agrave; longue &eacute;ch&eacute;ance.

<h4>Rendement : </h4>
<b>P</b>uisque les fonds du march&eacute; mon&eacute;taire comportent
g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement une valeur unitaire fixe de 10 $, leur valeur quotidienne est
exprim&eacute;e sous forme de rendement. Le rendement d'un placement correspond au revenu
annuel divis&eacute; par le prix. Les fonds du march&eacute; mon&eacute;taire doivent
obligatoirement publier deux rendements, soit le rendement courant et le rendement effectif. Le
rendement courant est &eacute;gal au revenu quotidien moyen des sept derniers jours,
transpos&eacute; en un taux annuel. Le rendement effectif, quant &agrave; lui, correspond au
taux annualis&eacute; lorsqu'on suppose que le revenu est r&eacute;investi chaque semaine.

<H2>C'EST UNE QUESTION DE TEMPS ...</H2>



<p><b>L</b>e moment est-il bien choisi pour investir dans les actions? Les obligations? Les

titres du march&eacute; mon&eacute;taire? Les pi&egrave;tres rendements de 1994 et

l'incertitude qui plane actuellement sur les march&eacute;s am&egrave;nent les investisseurs

&agrave; se poser ces questions. Ne vous laissez pas intimider par une ann&eacute;e difficile; au

contraire, profitez-en pour prendre du recul et consid&eacute;rer le facteur temps. Vous allez

probablement constater qu'aussi longtemps que vos placements correspondront &agrave; vos

objectifs &agrave; long terme, vous ne devriez pas vous pr&eacute;occuper des fluctuations

&agrave; court terme. 

<hr>

<h3>LA VOLATILIT&Eacute; RELATIVE DES CAT&Eacute;GORIES D'ACTIF</h3>

<b>L</b>es investisseurs qui r&eacute;ussissent visent le long terme, car ils savent

pertinemment que les march&eacute;s boursiers, obligataires et m&ecirc;me

mon&eacute;taires peuvent &ecirc;tre volatils &agrave; court terme. &Agrave; mesure que les

&eacute;conomies traversent leur cycle respectif, certains placements se portent mieux que

d'autres, comme en t&eacute;moigne le graphique ci-dessous. Cependant, &agrave; long

terme, le facteur temps att&eacute;nue cette volatilit&eacute; en nivelant les fluctuations du

march&eacute;. 



<P><b>L</b>es march&eacute;s ont de toute &eacute;vidence &eacute;t&eacute;

&eacute;branl&eacute;s au cours des derniers mois. Mais dans une optique &agrave; long

terme, le moment est propice &agrave; l'achat de titres plut&ocirc;t qu'&agrave; la vente. Par

exemple, si vous aviez achet&eacute; des actions en 1974  -  la pire ann&eacute;e du

march&eacute; boursier depuis les 30 derni&egrave;res ann&eacute;es  - et les aviez

conserv&eacute;es jusqu'en 1994, votre rendement annualis&eacute; au 31 d&eacute;cembre

1994 aurait &eacute;t&eacute; d'environ 12,6 % par an. 



<p><b>C</b>omme vous le voyez, les opinions &eacute;taient partag&eacute;es : autant

d'experts ont vu juste que ceux qui se sont tromp&eacute;s. 



<P><b>Q</b>ue faire pour &eacute;viter de tomber dans le pi&egrave;ge? Si vous recherchez

un rendement s&ucirc;r, il suffit d'&eacute;chelonner les &eacute;ch&eacute;ances de vos

placements. Ils seront ainsi moins vuln&eacute;rables aux fluctuations des taux

d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t puisque seulement une partie des titres viendra &agrave;

&eacute;ch&eacute;ance &agrave; la fois.



<p><center> 

<img src="fr-time1.gif">

<p><center><i><font size=-1>La volatilit&eacute; des march&eacute;s s'att&eacute;nue avec le

temps.</font></i></center>

<hr>

<h3>L'ANTICIPATION N'EST PAS TOUT</h3>

<b>I</b>l est tout &agrave; fait normal de vouloir &lt;&lt;anticiper le march&eacute;&gt;&gt;

et de se d&eacute;partir de certains placements jusqu'&agrave; ce que le march&eacute;

s'am&eacute;liore. Or, cette strat&eacute;gie n'est profitable que si vous parvenez &agrave;

vendre et &agrave; acheter au bon moment. Les revirements sont souvent rapides et subits, de

sorte que si vous ne r&eacute;agissez pas en temps opportun, la plupart des gains vous

&eacute;chapperont. 



<P><b>D</b>ans notre exemple, l'investisseur a d&eacute;cid&eacute; d'acheter des titres

dans le but de les conserver. En 1982, il a investi dans un portefeuille d'actions de

soci&eacute;t&eacute;s du TSE 300, puis les a vendues en 1994. Son rendement

annualis&eacute;, qui s'&eacute;l&egrave;ve &agrave; 9,5%, est comparable &agrave; celui

des actions sur 30 ans.



<p><b>V</b>oyons voir les r&eacute;sultats qu'il aurait obtenus s'il avait tent&eacute;

d'anticiper le march&eacute;, en vendant et en rachetant &agrave; r&eacute;p&eacute;tition.

Par exemple, s'il avait rat&eacute; les 10 meilleures journ&eacute;es des 3 027 jours ouvrables

de cette p&eacute;riode, son rendement annuel tombait &agrave; 5,8 %; s'il avait rat&eacute;

les 20 meilleures journ&eacute;es, le rendement glissait &agrave; 3,7 % et les 30

meilleures journ&eacute;es, &agrave; 2,1 % par rapport &agrave; l'inflation. Ainsi, en prenant

part aux bonnes journ&eacute;es comme aux mauvaises et en conservant ses titres,

l'investisseur est parvenu &agrave; r&eacute;aliser un rendement sup&eacute;rieur. 



<P><center>

<img src="fr-time4.gif">

</center>

<p><center><i>(Rendements annualis&eacute;s)</i></center>

<p><center><i><font size=-1>Plus volatiles &agrave; court terme, les actions surpassent

nettement les autres cat&eacute;gories d'actif &agrave; longue

&eacute;ch&eacute;ance.</font></i></center>



<hr>

<h3>LE RAPPORT RISQUE-RENDEMENT </h3>

<B>P</b>our les investisseurs pr&ecirc;ts &agrave; en assumer la volatilit&eacute;

&eacute;lev&eacute;e, les actions ont, par le pass&eacute;, obtenu les meilleurs rendements

apr&egrave;s inflation. Viennent ensuite les obligations et les titres du march&eacute;

mon&eacute;taire. Cependant, les taux d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t ont augment&eacute; plus

rapidement que pr&eacute;vu en 1994, ce qui a permis aux titres du march&eacute;

mon&eacute;taire de devancer les actions et les obligations, pour la premi&egrave;re fois

depuis des ann&eacute;es. Or, en termes historiques, le rendement des titres du

march&eacute; mon&eacute;taire d&eacute;passe &agrave; peine le taux d'inflation.

Malgr&eacute; leur performance peu reluisante en 1994, les actions ont d&eacute;gag&eacute;

un rendement de loin sup&eacute;rieur au co&ucirc;t de la vie.

Economic Week, f&eacute;vrier '85</font></i></center>

<p><center><font size=-1><i>M&ecirc;me les experts n'ont pas toujours raison.</i></font>

</center>





<P><b>M</b>&ecirc;me si, sur une longue p&eacute;riode, ce sont les actions qui ont

rapport&eacute; les meilleurs rendements, il ne serait pas sage d'y investir tout votre avoir. Les

gestionnaires professionnels ont constat&eacute; qu'un portefeuille diversifi&eacute;

constitu&eacute; d'actions -- pour la croissance -- d'obligations et d'hypoth&egrave;ques  - pour

le revenu r&eacute;gulier - et de titres du march&eacute; mon&eacute;taire - pour la

s&eacute;curit&eacute; -, profite largement de l'essor du march&eacute; boursier, tout en

&eacute;tant plus stable qu'un portefeuille compos&eacute; exclusivement d'actions. Puisque

les diverses cat&eacute;gories d'actif ont un rendement diff&eacute;rent selon le stade

o&ugrave; l'on se trouve dans le cycle &eacute;conomique, un rendement positif dans une

cat&eacute;gorie d'actif compense un rendement n&eacute;gatif dans une autre.

<hr>

<h3>IL EST DIFFICILE DE PR&Eacute;VOIR LA FLUCTUATION DES TAUX D'

INT&Eacute;R&Ecirc;T</h3>

<b>L</b>orsque vous achetez un titre &agrave; revenu fixe, vous vous assurez un revenu

r&eacute;gulier, mais les possibilit&eacute;s de rendement sup&eacute;rieur &agrave; long

terme et la protection contre l'inflation seront r&eacute;duites. De plus, vous devez choisir le

bon moment pour acheter. En optant pour un placement &agrave; revenu fixe, vous supposez

que les taux d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t n'augmenteront pas pendant la dur&eacute;e du placement

et qu'ils seront les m&ecirc;mes, sinon sup&eacute;rieurs, lorsque votre placement

arrivera &agrave; &eacute;ch&eacute;ance. Vous aurez probablement tort, car il est difficile,

voire impossible, de pr&eacute;voir l'&eacute;volution des taux d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t,

m&ecirc;me pour les experts. 



<P><b>S</b>ur une p&eacute;riode de douze mois, on a demand&eacute; &agrave; 100

gestionnaires de caisses de retraite de pr&eacute;dire la direction que prendraient les taux

d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t le mois suivant. Ceux qui pr&eacute;voyaient une hausse des taux se

situaient au-dessus de la ligne du centre, tandis que ceux qui pr&eacute;voyaient une baisse

des taux se situaient sous cette m&ecirc;me ligne. Chaque mois, ceux dont les

pr&eacute;visions s'av&eacute;raient justes &eacute;taient repr&eacute;sent&eacute;s en vert

et ceux qui s'&eacute;taient tromp&eacute;s, en jaune. La ligne rouge indique le mouvement

r&eacute;el des taux d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t.

<H2>FAITES PASSER VOTRE REER EN QUATRI&Egrave;ME VITESSE!</h2>

<h3>Strat&eacute;gies brillantes pour la retraite</h3>



<b>A</b>ujourd'hui, la plupart des gens savent qu'il est important de cotiser &agrave; un

REER. Pourtant, ils se bornent trop souvent aux avantages imm&eacute;diats, versant leur

cotisation &agrave; la toute derni&egrave;re minute dans le seul but d'&eacute;conomiser de

l'imp&ocirc;t. Ils songent peu &agrave; la retraite, qui leur semble tr&egrave;s

&eacute;loign&eacute;e dans le temps. Pour sa part, l'investisseur avis&eacute; sait que plus il

cotise t&ocirc;t &agrave; son REER, plus son capital sera imposant &agrave; la retraite,

p&eacute;riode de la vie o&ugrave; chaque dollar compte.

<hr>

<h3>CHOISIR LA BONNE COMBINAISON DE PLACEMENTS</h3>

<b>B</b>ien choisir ses placements peut faire toute la diff&eacute;rence. Par exemple,

l'investisseur qui verse 5 500 $ par ann&eacute;e dans son REER, &agrave; un taux de

rendement annuel compos&eacute; moyen de 8 %, disposera de 271 826 $ au bout de 20 ans.



<p><b>S</b>i ce taux de rendement monte &agrave; 10 %, le capital accumul&eacute; au bout

de 20 ans passe &agrave; 346 514 $. 



<p><b>Q</b>ue faire pour augmenter votre taux de rendement sans mettre en p&eacute;ril vos

&eacute;conomies? La plupart des investisseurs choisissent la diversification. Cette technique

diminue le risque et augmente les chances de plus-value du capital lorsque vous

r&eacute;partissez vos placements entre les trois grandes cat&eacute;gories d'actif :

march&eacute; mon&eacute;taire pour la s&eacute;curit&eacute;, hypoth&egrave;ques et

obligations pour le revenu r&eacute;gulier, actions pour la croissance.



<p><b>E</b>n r&eacute;partissant avec soin les diverses cat&eacute;gories d'actif, les

professionnels du placement ont constat&eacute; qu'ils pouvaient combiner les

caract&eacute;ristiques souhaitables de chaque cat&eacute;gorie tout en diminuant les risques.

Par exemple, un portefeuille compos&eacute; d'actions, d'obligations et de titres du

march&eacute; mon&eacute;taire peut profiter d'une bonne partie de la croissance

caract&eacute;ristique du march&eacute; boursier, mais avec moins de volatilit&eacute; qu'un

portefeuille compos&eacute; enti&egrave;rement d'actions. Comme les divers march&eacute;s

fluctuent ind&eacute;pendamment les uns des autres, le bon rendement d'une

cat&eacute;gorie d'actif peut contrebalancer le mauvais rendement d'une autre

cat&eacute;gorie, ce qui se traduit par une volatilit&eacute; globale moindre &agrave; long

terme.



<p><b>L</b>a r&eacute;partition d'actif que vous allez choisir d&eacute;pendra principalement

de votre &acirc;ge, de votre horizon de placement et de votre tol&eacute;rance au risque.

Les personnes qui approchent de la retraite ont tendance &agrave; privil&eacute;gier les titres

&agrave; revenu pour prot&eacute;ger leur capital. Les jeunes gens, quant &agrave; eux, ont

tendance &agrave; combiner des placements en actions, pour fins de croissance, et titres

&agrave; revenu fixe, pour fins d'&eacute;quilibre.

<hr>

<h3>UNE SOLUTION: LES FONDS MUTUELS</h3><b>L</b>es fonds mutuels sont un

moyen id&eacute;al de se constituer un portefeuille o&ugrave; l'on retrouve les trois

cat&eacute;gories d'actif. 



<P><b>I</b>nvestissant dans un large &eacute;ventail de titres, donc diversifi&eacutes par

d&eacute;finition, les fonds mutuels sont g&eacute;r&eacute;s par des experts qui se fixent des

objectifs bien pr&eacute;cis. Les fonds mutuels sont populaires parce qu'ils constituent un

moyen plus pratique et plus abordable de se b&acirc;tir un portefeuille que de tout faire

soi-m&ecirc;me.



<p><b>L</b>a gamme de fonds mutuels sans frais d'acquisition Ligne Verte facilite encore

plus le placement. Le Mod&egrave;le de r&eacute;partition d'actif de la Banque TD supprime

une bonne partie du hasard et cr&eacute;e la combinaison optimale de fonds qui correspond

&agrave; vos objectifs et &agrave; vos besoins particuliers de placement. La gamme Ligne

Verte compte 31 fonds capables de r&eacute;pondre aux besoins de presque tous les

investisseurs. Chaque fonds a un objectif de placement bien d&eacute;fini et est

g&eacute;r&eacute; par une &eacute;quipe d'experts r&eacute;put&eacute;s. Il n'y a pas de

frais d'acquisition; vous passez sans probl&egrave;me d'un fonds &agrave; un autre quand vos

objectifs de placement et vos besoins particuliers changent.

<hr>

<h3>SAVOIR PROFITER DU FACTEUR TEMPS </h3>

<b>U</b>ne bonne diversification contribuera &agrave; vous assurer une retraite confortable,

mais le rendement de votre capital-retraite sera encore plus &eacute;lev&eacute; si vous savez

tirer le meilleur parti du facteur temps. L'un des moyens d'y arriver est de cotiser &agrave; son

REER d&egrave;s qu'on commence &agrave; travailler.



<P><b>N</b>athalie est &acirc;g&eacute;e de 23 ans. Elle cotise 100 $ par mois dans son

REER jusqu'&agrave; l'&acirc;ge de 31 ans (soit pendant neuf ans), puis cesse toute cotisation.

Ted attend jusqu'&agrave; l'&acirc;ge de 31 ans avant de cotiser &agrave; un REER. Il cotise

alors 100 $ par mois jusqu'&agrave; l'&acirc;ge de 65 ans. Devinez qui, de Nathalie ou de Ted,

aura le capital le plus garni &agrave; l'&acirc;ge de 65 ans, dans l'hypoth&egrave;se

o&ugrave; le taux de rendement annuel compos&eacute; moyen est &eacute;gal &agrave; 8

%? Nathalie aura accumul&eacute; 236 800 $ apr&egrave;s avoir investi 10 800 $, et Ted aura

accumul&eacute; 229 400 $ apr&egrave;s un placement de 42 000 $. 

<BR>

<P><center><img

src="fr-rspn1.gif">

</center><BR><BR>



<p><b>C</b>et exemple illustre le pouvoir de l'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t compos&eacute; qui

s'accumule en franchise d'imp&ocirc;t dans un REER. Une autre fa&ccedil;on de profiter de

l'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t compos&eacute; est de verser sa cotisation au d&eacute;but de

l'ann&eacute;e. Un exemple : si vous versez votre cotisation de 1996 en janvier de la

m&ecirc;me ann&eacute;e au lieu d'attendre au 1er mars 1997, vous aurez 14 mois de plus

pour lui faire prendre de la valeur. &Agrave; longue &eacute;ch&eacute;ance, vous gagneriez

plusieurs milliers de dollars comme l'indique l'exemple ci-dessous.

<h3>TROUVER L'ARGENT N&Eacute;CESSAIRE</h3>

<b>I</b>l est sage de cotiser &agrave; son REER d&egrave;s janvier, mais beaucoup de gens

n'arrivent pas &agrave; trouver l'argent n&eacute;cessaire au lendemain de la p&eacute;riode

des f&ecirc;tes. Une solution possible consiste &agrave; verser de petites sommes

r&eacute;guli&egrave;rement pendant l'ann&eacute;e. Les cotisations s'accumulent en franchise

d'imp&ocirc;t pendant plus longtemps, et vous n'avez pas besoin de verser un gros montant juste

avant la date limite. La Banque TD propose un Plan d'achat pr&eacute;autoris&eacute;

tr&egrave;s pratique, qui vous permet d'investir aussi peu que 25 $ par fonds. 



<p><b>U</b>ne autre strat&eacute;gie consiste &agrave; emprunter votre cotisation ou un

montant additionnel qui portera votre cotisation au plafond autoris&eacute;, par exemple.

&Agrave; longue &eacute;ch&eacute;ance, les frais d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t vaudront

peut-&ecirc;tre leur pesant d'or si vous tenez compte des &eacute;conomies d'imp&ocirc;t et de

l'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t compos&eacute;. Pour que vous ne ratiez pas une occasion de cotiser, la

Banque TD vous propose deux pr&ecirc;ts-REER &agrave; un taux d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t

pr&eacute;f&eacute;rentiel : le pr&ecirc;t-RER TD et le Plan d'avenir TD. Le pr&ecirc;t-RER

TD est un pr&ecirc;t traditionnel consenti &agrave; un taux pr&eacute;f&eacute;rentiel et

remboursable sur une p&eacute;riode d'un an, tandis que le Plan d'avenir TD constitue un tout

nouvel outil de planification financi&egrave;re qui combine les avantages d'un pr&ecirc;t-RER

&agrave; ceux d'un programme d'&eacute;pargne syst&eacute;matique. Dans le cadre du Plan

d'avenir TD, vous obtenez un pr&ecirc;t &agrave; un taux pr&eacute;f&eacute;rentiel, si vous le

d&eacute;sirez, et en investissez le montant dans votre RER fonds mutuels Ligne Verte.

&Agrave;

l'instar d'un pr&ecirc;t-RER, les mensualit&eacute;s sont calcul&eacute;es sur une

ann&eacute;e. Cependant, plut&ocirc;t que de rembourser le capital en un an, vous avez

jusqu'&agrave; dix ans pour le faire. Chaque mois, vous versez les int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts

courus sur le pr&ecirc;t, et la mensualit&eacute; qui normalement devrait servir &agrave;

rembourser le capital est alors investie dans votre REER par le biais du Plan d'achat

pr&eacute;autoris&eacute;. Rendez-vous &agrave; la succursale TD la plus proche pour obtenir

de plus amples renseignements sur le pr&ecirc;t-RER TD ou le Plan d'avenir TD. 



<p><b>L</b>a diversification et le pouvoir de l'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t compos&eacute; en

franchise d'imp&ocirc;t sont deux moyens de tirer le meilleur parti de votre REER.

<b>Profitez-vous au maximum de votre REER?</b><br>

<H2>&Ecirc;TES-VOUS UN INVESTISSEUR NERVEUX?</H2>



<P><B>P</B>lusieurs facteurs peuvent miner la confiance de l'investisseur : la

volatilit&eacute; des march&eacute;s boursiers, les pr&eacute;occupations quant &agrave; la

stabilit&eacute; politique du Canada, les fluctuations quotidiennes des indicateurs

&eacute;conomiques et les pr&eacute;visions contradictoires quant &agrave;

l'&eacute;conomie sur le plan national et international. 



<p><b>P</b>ar contre, il ne faut pas oublier que nous avons v&eacute;cu des p&eacute;riodes

de volatilit&eacute; par le pass&eacute; et qu'elles caract&eacute;risent la nature cyclique de

l'&eacute;conomie canadienne. En p&eacute;riode d'incertitude, il peut &ecirc;tre utile de

prendre un certain recul et d'examiner le comportement des indicateurs &eacute;conomiques

dans le temps. On constate alors un profil qui se r&eacute;p&egrave;te tous les quatre

&agrave; sept ans, c'est-&agrave;-dire le cycle des taux d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t et le cycle

&eacute;conomique. 



<P><b>S</b>i vous examinez attentivement les phases du cycle &eacute;conomique, vous

pouvez voir &agrave; peu pr&egrave;s o&ugrave; le cycle en est rendu aujourd'hui. Vous

&ecirc;tes ainsi beaucoup mieux pr&eacute;par&eacute; &agrave; envisager des placements et

plus confiant de r&eacute;aliser vos objectifs financiers &agrave; long terme.



<p><b>L</b>e cycle &eacute;conomique comporte deux principales phases, soit l'expansion et

la contraction. Il atteint son sommet &agrave; la toute fin de la phase expansionniste. Les

p&eacute;riodes d'expansion et de contraction ne sont pas forc&eacute;ment de dur&eacute;e

&eacute;gale et elles sont sujettes, &agrave; l'occasion, &agrave; des changements d'allure et

de direction. C'est d'ailleurs &agrave; cause de ces al&eacute;as qu'il est difficile de savoir

exactement o&ugrave; on se trouve dans le cycle au jour le jour.

<hr>

<h3>CONTRACTION</h3>

<b>A</b>u d&eacute;but d'une phase de contraction &eacute;conomique, les taux

d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t amorcent habituellement une chute soutenue qui d&eacute;clenche une

hausse des cours obligataires et une baisse des cours boursiers. Une p&eacute;riode de

contraction prolong&eacute;e s'appelle une r&eacute;cession. La derni&egrave;re

r&eacute;cession a commenc&eacute; en 1990 et s'est termin&eacute;e vers la fin de

l'automne 1991. 



<p><b>N</b>ous connaissons trop bien les signes d'une r&eacute;cession. Le nombre

d'emplois diminue, entra&icirc;nant une mont&eacute;e du ch&ocirc;mage. Comme il y a moins

de personnes au travail, les consommateurs ont moins &agrave; d&eacute;penser et ils s'en

tiennent habituellement au strict n&eacute;cessaire. M&ecirc;me ceux qui ont toujours un

emploi se serrent la ceinture, craignant de devenir ch&ocirc;meurs &agrave; leur tour. L'effet

domino peut se poursuivre ind&eacute;finiment. La baisse de la demande des consommateurs

occasionne un repli de la production et la possibilit&eacute; d'autres pertes d'emploi. Dans une

r&eacute;cession, on dit souvent que l'&eacute;conomie pique du nez.



<p><b>E</b>n p&eacute;riode de ralentissement &eacute;conomique, les fonds de revenu

(fonds hypoth&eacute;caires et obligataires, par exemple) ont tendance &agrave; bien se

comporter. En effet, la chute des taux d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t fait remonter la valeur de ces fonds

ax&eacute;s sur le revenu.

<hr>

<h3>EXPANSION</h3>

<b>E</b>n p&eacute;riode expansionniste, les cours des actions montent en pr&eacute;vision

d'une progression des b&eacute;n&eacute;fices, attribuable &agrave; son tour &agrave; une

intensification de l'activit&eacute; &eacute;conomique. Les cours des obligations baissent

&agrave; mesure qu'augmentent les taux d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t. Cette phase du cycle s'appelle

souvent la reprise. Les fonds de croissance tirent bien leur &eacute;pingle du jeu en

p&eacute;riode expansionniste. 



<P><b>I</b>l arrive souvent qu'une reprise s'amorce sans qu'on s'en rende compte, car elle

laisse peu de signes &eacute;vidents sur son passage. Il faut attendre une diminution du nombre

de ch&ocirc;meurs ou une augmentation des d&eacute;penses des consommateurs et des

entreprises pour savoir qu'une reprise est en cours. 



<P><b>U</b>ne reprise peut &lt;&lt;s'acc&eacute;l&eacute;rer&gt;&gt;. Par exemple, le

redressement des d&eacute;penses des consommateurs favorise la production, ce qui peut

entra&icirc;ner la cr&eacute;ation d'emplois. Tous ces facteurs concourent &agrave;

&eacute;tayer la confiance des consommateurs et &agrave; encourager les d&eacute;penses, qui

sont alors consacr&eacute;es aux gros achats (&eacute;lectrom&eacute;nagers ou voitures, par

exemple). 



<p><b>P</b>our bien des observateurs, cette tendance &agrave; la hausse semble

h&eacute;sitante au cours de la pr&eacute;sente reprise. Ils expliquent ce

ph&eacute;nom&egrave;ne par la restructuration &eacute;conomique tr&egrave;s

r&eacute;pandue qui a marqu&eacute; la derni&egrave;re r&eacute;cession et le d&eacute;lai

plus long que mettent les consommateurs &agrave; se convaincre que la r&eacute;cession est

effectivement termin&eacute;e.

<h3>&Agrave; QUELLE &Eacute;TAPE DU CYCLE &Eacute;CONOMIQUE

SOMMES-NOUS RENDUS?</h3>

<b>&Agrave;</b> l'heure actuelle, beaucoup d'&eacute;conomistes nous situent au beau milieu

d'une phase expansionniste. M&ecirc;me si l'agitation du march&eacute; des actions et

l'instabilit&eacute; des taux d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t semblent d&eacute;mentir cette

&eacute;valuation, il n'en est rien. La volatilit&eacute; du march&eacute;, dans la mesure

o&ugrave; nous l'avons v&eacute;cue derni&egrave;rement, serait attribuable &agrave; la

transition entre un march&eacute; dont les cours sont d&eacute;termin&eacute;s par la chute

des taux d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t, et un march&eacute; dont les cours sont ax&eacute;s

principalement sur les b&eacute;n&eacute;fices des entreprises. Une &eacute;volution

semblable a &eacute;t&eacute; constat&eacute;e en 1984, en plein milieu du march&eacute;

haussier des ann&eacute;es 1982-1987. 



<p><b>J</b>usqu'ici, d'ailleurs, les b&eacute;n&eacute;fices des entreprises promettent

d'&ecirc;tre int&eacute;ressants en 1994, ce qui rend attrayants les placements en actions.

D'autres indicateurs &eacute;conomiques appuient &eacute;galement les actions : le

ch&ocirc;mage r&eacute;gresse, les b&eacute;n&eacute;fices trimestriels progressent, et les

exportations canadiennes - surtout &agrave; destination des &Eacute;tats-Unis - continuent sur

leur lanc&eacute;e. 



<p><b>E</b>n outre, notre taux d'inflation reste faible. Il s'ensuit notamment que les

b&eacute;n&eacute;fices sont &lt;&lt;r&eacute;els&gt;&gt;, c'est-&agrave;-dire qu'ils ne sont

pas gonfl&eacute;s artificiellement par des facteurs inflationnistes. Par ailleurs, on exerce peu de

pression sur la Banque du Canada pour qu'elle hausse les taux d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t en vue de

mater l'inflation; le loyer de l'argent n'a gu&egrave;re &eacute;t&eacute; aussi abordable en

vingt ans.

<h3>DIVERSIFICATION</h3>

<b>C</b>'est seulement apr&egrave;s coup qu'on peut savoir exactement ce qui s'est

pass&eacute; dans l'&eacute;conomie. Aussi est-il essentiel de diversifier vos placements.

Ainsi, si une cat&eacute;gorie d'actif va mal, il est vraisemblable que d'autres cat&eacute;gories

de votre portefeuille iront bien. Nous savons que le cycle &eacute;conomique se

r&eacute;p&eacute;tera, mais nous ne pouvons pas pr&eacute;dire avec certitude &agrave; quel

moment interviendront les diverses &eacute;tapes du cycle.<br>



<p><center>

<img src="fr-anx4.gif">

</center><br>





<P><b>Assurez-vous d'&ecirc;tre bien &agrave; l'aise avec le genre de rendement que

rapportera votre placement.</b>



<p><b>S</b>elon la cat&eacute;gorie de l'actif, le prix peut n'&ecirc;tre qu'un facteur parmi

plusieurs qui entrent dans le calcul du rendement total du placement. Dans le cas des bons du

Tr&eacute;sor et des fonds du march&eacute; mon&eacute;taire, il n'entre m&ecirc;me pas en

ligne de compte. Outre le rendement d'ensemble, vous devriez tenir compte de l'apport d'un

placement donn&eacute; &agrave; votre portefeuille global, c'est-&agrave;-dire &agrave; la

r&eacute;alisation de votre strat&eacute;gie financi&egrave;re &agrave; long term e. Par

exemple, dans un portefeuille &eacute;quilibr&eacute;, vous pou-vez toucher un revenu

r&eacute;gulier tout en ayant la possibilit&eacute; d'un rendement plus int&eacute;ressant offert

par les placements plus risqu&eacute;s. Autrement dit, vous pouvez profiter &agrave; la fois

d'un revenu et d'une plus-value et r&eacute;duire le degr&eacute; global de risque de vos

placements - <b>en m&ecirc;me temps.</b>



<hr><h3>LE MOD&Egrave;LE DE R&Eacute;PARTITION D'ACTIF DE LA BANQUE

TD</h3><b>N</b>ous croyons que le Mod&egrave;le de r&eacute;partition d'actif de la

Banque TD repr&eacute;sente un des meilleurs outils qui soit pour &eacute;tablir un portefeuille

&eacute;quilibr&eacute; qui vous convient. Si vous n'avez pas encore rempli le Mod&egrave;le,

nous vous encourageons fortement &agrave; vous en procurer un exemplaire gratuit dans une

succursale de la Banque TD ou &agrave; composer le num&eacute;ro de la Ligne directe sans

frais de votre r&eacute;gion. Le Mod&egrave;le de r&eacute;partition d'actif peut vous aider

&agrave; d&eacute;terminer la composition optimale de votre portefeuille de fonds mutuels

pour ce qui concerne les placements en titres du march&eacute; mon&eacute;taire, en titres de

revenu et en titres de croissance. Un portefeuille &eacute;quilibr&eacute; vous aidera &agrave;

profiter de la conjoncture o&ugrave; que nous soyons dans le cycle &eacute;conomique. 



<p><b>U</b>ne strat&eacute;gie &eacute;prouv&eacute;e pour att&eacute;nuer vos

appr&eacute;hensions en mati&egrave;re de placement consiste &agrave; <i><b>diversifier vos

placements.</b></i>

<H2> LES MEILLEURES STRAT&Eacute;GIES POUR LE REER</h2>

<P><i>Il n'est pas trop t&ocirc;t pour penser &agrave; votre REER. Voici huit moyens efficaces

pour une retraite sereine.</i>

<hr>

<p><center>

<IMG SRC="fr-strg1.gif">

<P><i><font=-1>Dans cet exemple en ratant ne serait-ce que les 10 jours o&ugrave; les hausses

ont &eacute;t&eacute; les plus fortes pendant la p&eacute;riode de 13 ans , le rendement glisse

de 9,65 % par an &agrave; 6,12 % par an. M&ecirc;me si en conservant ses titres, l'investisseur

se trouve &agrave; subir tous les pires jours tout en profitant des meilleurs jours, le rendement

est au bout du compte nettement plus &eacute;lev&eacute;.</font></i></center>



<P><B>1. COMMENCER T&Ocirc;T</b>

<P><b>P</b>our accumuler le capital maximum en franchise d'imp&ocirc;t, contribuez le

montant le plus &eacute;lev&eacute; possible d&egrave;s que vous pouvez pendant votre vie

active. Une fois que vous avez &eacute;tabli un compte REER, prenez l'habitude de verser vos

cotisations le plus t&ocirc;t possible pendant l'ann&eacute;e. Si la cotisation de 1996 est

vers&eacute;e en janvier de la m&ecirc;me ann&eacute;e au lieu du 1<font size=-1>er</font>

mars 1997, votre placement peut fructifier &agrave; l'abri du fisc durant 14 mois de plus. Avec le

temps, cela peut se traduire par un capital additionnel de milliers de dollars. 



<p><b>P</b>ar exemple, si vous investissez 3 500 $ au d&eacute;but de chaque ann&eacute;e,

vous allez accumuler 289 549 $ apr&egrave;s 25 ans, en supposant un taux de rendement annuel

compos&eacute; de 8 %. En attendant &agrave; la fin de l'ann&eacute;e, vos &eacute;conomies

ne se chiffrent plus qu'&agrave; 267 358 $, une diff&eacute;rence de 22 191 $.



<P><B>2. INVESTIR SOUVENT</b>

<P><b>L</b>orsque vous investissez de petits montants sur une base r&eacute;guli&egrave;re,

votre capital grossit beaucoup plus rapidement que vous le pensez. C'est aussi un moyen pratique

de cotiser &agrave; votre REER. Par exemple, un placement de 25 $ par semaine, moyennant

un taux de rendement annuel compos&eacute; de 8 %, vous procurera un capital de 19 923 $

au bout de 10 ans, de 64 237 $ au bout de 20 ans et de 162 797 $ au bout de 30 ans.



<P><B>3. CONSERVER SES PLACEMENTS</b>

<p><b>O</b>n peut &ecirc;tre tent&eacute; d'anticiper les march&eacute;s en passant d'un

placement &agrave; un autre lorsque la conjoncture change. Mais cette strat&eacute;gie n'est

vraiment efficace qu'&agrave; condition de choisir exactement le moment opportun. Or, lorsque

le march&eacute; se redresse, il remonte souvent tr&egrave;s rapidement; il faut donc &ecirc;tre

pr&eacute;sent sur ce march&eacute; d&egrave;s le d&eacute;but, sinon on perd une bonne

partie du gain r&eacute;alis&eacute;.



<P><b>4. COTISER LE MAXIMUM</b>

<p><b>E</b>n cotisant le montant maximum permis, vous b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiez

d&egrave;s maintenant du plus grand avantage fiscal possible et tirerez profit d'une croissance

compos&eacute;e au moment de la retraite. 



<p><b>S</b>i vous avez besoin d'aide pour votre cotisation cette ann&eacute;e, le Plan d'avenir

TD peut &ecirc;tre une solution. Vous obtenez un pr&ecirc;t au taux

pr&eacute;f&eacute;rentiel de La Banque Toronto-Dominion et, si vous le d&eacute;sirez, vous

l'investissez dans votre RER constitu&eacute; de fonds mutuels sans frais d'acquisition de la

gamme Ligne Verte. Comme un pr&ecirc;t REER ordinaire, les mensualit&eacute;s sont

calcul&eacute;es sur une ann&eacute;e. Cependant, vous n'avez pas un an mais dix ans pour

rembourser le principal. Vous payez chaque mois les int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts courus sur le

pr&ecirc;t. Le restant de la mensualit&eacute; qui aurait servi &agrave; rembourser le principal

est alors investi dans votre REER dans le cadre d'un Plan d'achat pr&eacute;autoris&eacute;. 



<P><b>A</b>u lieu d'emprunter, la meilleure solution &agrave; long terme consiste &agrave;

pr&eacute;voir d&egrave;s maintenant la cotisation de l'ann&eacute;e prochaine en participant

au Plan d'achat pr&eacute;autoris&eacute; TD. Vous investissez un minimum de 25 $ par

fonds, montant qui est pr&eacute;lev&eacute; automatiquement dans votre compte de banque

&agrave; intervalles r&eacute;guliers - chaque semaine, chaque mois, chaque trimestre ou

chaque p&eacute;riode de paye. C'est une fa&ccedil;on d'&eacute;conomiser qui ne fait pas mal;

de plus, vous &eacute;vitez d'&ecirc;tre pris &agrave; la derni&egrave;re minute &agrave;

chercher l'argent n&eacute;cessaire.



<p><center>

<IMG SRC="fr-strg2.gif">

</center>



<P><b>5. AUGMENTER LE CONTENU &Eacute;TRANGER</b>

<p><b>L</b>es placements internationaux vous donnent acc&egrave;s &agrave; 97 % des

occasions qui existent au-del&agrave; de nos fronti&egrave;res. &Eacute;tant donn&eacute; que

les march&eacute;s, les &eacute;conomies et les monnaies des pays &eacute;trangers

&eacute;voluent selon des cycles diff&eacute;rents, un portefeuille diversifi&eacute; &agrave;

l'&eacute;chelle internationale est habituellement moins volatil qu'un portefeuille limit&eacute;

&agrave; un seul pays. Augmentez le contenu &eacute;tranger de votre REER pour profiter des

occasions offertes. M&ecirc;me si le plafond de titres &eacute;trangers s'&eacute;l&egrave;ve

&agrave; 20 % de la valeur comptable (co&ucirc;t initial) de votre REER, nous recommandons

de ne pas d&eacute;passer 18 % afin de laisser une marge pour les distributions.



<P><b>6. CONSOLIDER VOS REER</b>

<p><b>I</b>l est plus facile de g&eacute;rer son portefeuille lorsque tous les placements sont

r&eacute;unis dans un seul compte. La tenue de dossiers est simplifi&eacute;e parce que vous

recevez un seul relev&eacute;. De plus, le fait de d&eacute;tenir tous vos placements dans un

seul r&eacute;gime vous permet de d&eacute;tenir le maximum de titres &eacute;trangers

permis par la loi.  



<p><b>S</b>i vous poss&eacute;dez d&eacute;j&agrave; des fonds mutuels, des titres &agrave;

revenu fixe ou des titres du march&eacute; mon&eacute;taire dans des comptes

s&eacute;par&eacute;s ou si vous envisagez de les inclure dans votre portefeuille, le compte

Accumulactif TD s'adresse peut-&ecirc;tre &agrave; vous. Ce compte vous permet de

d&eacute;tenir &agrave; peu pr&egrave;s tous les types de placements, &agrave; l'exception

des actions et des obligations de soci&eacute;t&eacute;s. De plus, vous pouvez consulter nos

sp&eacute;cialistes des placements en vous rendant &agrave; une succursale TD ou en

composant le num&eacute;ro de notre Ligne directe sans frais.



<P><b>7. &Eacute;TABLIR UN REER AU PROFIT DU CONJOINT</b>

<p><b>U</b>n tel REER permet &agrave; l'un des conjoints de cotiser au r&eacute;gime au

nom de l'autre conjoint. Celui qui verse la cotisation profite de la d&eacute;duction fiscale,

tandis que le titulaire du r&eacute;gime en d&eacute;tient les fonds. Le REER au profit du

conjoint aide &agrave; r&eacute;partir le revenu de fa&ccedil;on &eacute;gale et r&eacute;duit

le montant total de l'imp&ocirc;t vers&eacute; au moment de la retraite. Le RER fonds mutuels

sans frais d'acquisition Ligne Verte vous offre cette possibilit&eacute;; profitez-en.



<P><b>8. VARIER LES TYPES DE PLACEMENTS</b>

<p><b>U</b>n excellent moyen de r&eacute;duire le risque et d'accro&icirc;tre les

possibilit&eacute;s de rendement consiste &agrave; investir dans les titres du march&eacute;

mon&eacute;taire en vue de la s&eacute;curit&eacute;, dans les obligations et les

hypoth&egrave;ques en vue du revenu et dans les actions en vue de la croissance. En outre, les

placements &eacute;trangers ajoutent &agrave; votre portefeuille une diversification

mon&eacute;taire et g&eacute;ographique. 



<p><b>S</b>i vous poss&eacute;dez d&eacute;j&agrave; un portefeuille diversifi&eacute;, c'est

un bon moment pour passer en revue vos placements et les r&eacute;&eacute;quilibrer si

n&eacute;cessaire. &Eacute;tant donn&eacute; que votre situation personnelle et la valeur

marchande de vos placements peut changer, il est sage de proc&eacute;der &agrave; un tel

examen au moins une fois par ann&eacute;e. Vous vous assurez ainsi que votre

strat&eacute;gie de placement est appropri&eacute;e et que vous faites fructifier votre argent

au maximum.

prochaines ann&eacute;es, les &eacute;tudes universitaires de chacun de vos enfants pourraient

co&ucirc;ter entre 31 000 $ et 44 000 $. Et ces chiffres ne tiennent m&ecirc;me pas compte de la

probabilit&eacute; que l'&Eacute;tat augmentera les frais de scolarit&eacute;.



<p><b>B</b>ien entendu, les bourses d'&eacute;tudes et l'aide financi&egrave;re pourraient

donner un coup de main &agrave; de nombreuses familles, mais rien ne garantit que vos enfants

en b&eacute;n&eacute;ficieront. Il faudrait aussi ne pas trop vous fier aux pr&ecirc;ts

&eacute;tudiants. Les emprunts co&ucirc;tent cher et repr&eacute;sentent un lourd fardeau pour

un jeune dipl&ocirc;m&eacute; qui cherche &agrave; s'&eacute;tablir. Finalement, beaucoup de

parents financent la plus grande partie des &eacute;tudes de leurs enfants. Si dans les faits

beaucoup de parents financent en garde partie les &eacute;tudes de leurs enfants, il vous est

n&eacute;anmoins possible d'assumer ce co&ucirc;t &eacute;lev&eacute; par une bonne

planification.

<h3>COMMENCER T&Ocirc;T ET  INVESTIR SOUVENT </h3>

<b>L</b>a meilleure fa&ccedil;on de se b&acirc;tir un fonds d'&eacute;pargne-&eacute;tudes

est de

penser &agrave; long terme en profitant du jeu de l'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t compos&eacute;.

Comme bien

des parents n'ont pas les ressources voulues pour investir une grosse somme lorsque leurs enfants

sont

en bas &acirc;ge, il vaut sans doute mieux investir de petites sommes &agrave; intervalles

r&eacute;guliers. Saviez-vous qu'en pla&ccedil;ant seulement 25 $ par semaine, vous

accumuleriez une

somme de 37 652 $ au bout de 15 ans, si l'on suppose un taux de rendement annuel

compos&eacute; de

8 %?

<hr>

<h3>STRAT&Eacute;GIES DE PLACEMENT</h3>

<font size=+1><b>R&eacute;gime enregistr&eacute;

d'&eacute;pargne-&eacute;tudes</b></font>

<P><b>L</b>e r&eacute;gime enregistr&eacute;

d'&eacute;pargne-&eacute;tudes (REEE) est un bon moyen d'&eacute;conomiser en vue de

financer les &eacute;tudes de

ses enfants. Il est possible de cotiser chaque ann&eacute;e jusqu'&agrave; 1 500 $ par enfant (le

&lt;&lt;b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire&gt;&gt;) pendant 21 ans, jusqu'&agrave; concurrence de 31

500 $.

M&ecirc;me si les cotisations ne sont pas d&eacute;ductibles, elles s'accumulent en franchise

d'imp&ocirc;t jusqu'au moment du retrait. &Agrave; ce moment-l&agrave;, tout revenu

d&eacute;coulant

de cette somme sera impos&eacute; au taux d'imposition de l'&eacute;tudiant. Selon toute vrai

semblance, ce taux sera moins &eacute;lev&eacute; que celui de la personne qui aura

cotis&eacute; au

r&eacute;gime.



<p><b>B</b>ien qu'on puisse retirer le capital sans p&eacute;nalit&eacute;, il faut que les

revenus de

placement du r&eacute;gime servent aux fins de l'&eacute;ducation postsecondaire. Vous pouvez

d&eacute;signer autant de b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaires du r&eacute;gime que vous le

d&eacute;sirez et

les changer en tout temps.



<p><b>U</b>n REEE doit prendre fin au plus tard 25 ans apr&egrave;s sa cr&eacute;ation. Si

l'argent

n'est pas utilis&eacute; pour les &eacute;tudes, vous perdez l'avantage fiscal; tous les revenus de

placement doivent &ecirc;tre remis &agrave; une institution postsecondaire de votre choix ou

servir

&agrave; constituer des bourses d'&eacute;tudes postsecondaires. 



<p><font size=+1><b>Fiducie de bourses d'&eacute;tudes</b></font>

<P>

<b>U</b>n deuxi&egrave;me type de r&eacute;gime d'&eacute;pargne-&eacute;tudes est la

fiducie de

bourses d'&eacute;tudes. Ce r&eacute;gime fonctionne davantage comme un &lt;&lt;fonds

d'assurance&gt;&gt;. Les revenus provenant de toutes les cotisations sont mis en commun dans

un gros

fonds qui verse des bourses d'&eacute;tudes aux enfants admissibles &agrave; mesure qu'ils

progressent

dans leurs &eacute;tudes postsecondaires. Avec ce type de r&eacute;gime, on

b&eacute;n&eacute;ficie

grosso modo de la part qu'on a vers&eacute;e. Cependant, les fiducies de bourses

d'&eacute;tudes

comportent souvent des restrictions. Si votre enfant n'est pas inscrit dans un programme

d'&eacute;tudes

sup&eacute;rieures &agrave; l'int&eacute;rieur du d&eacute;lai prescrit, vos revenus

d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts reviennent, en temps normal, aux autres titulaires du r&eacute;gime. Il

peut y avoir

&eacute;galement des restrictions en ce qui a trait au changement de b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire.



<p><b>E</b>n g&eacute;n&eacute;ral, la souplesse est de mise pour les REEE et les fiducies de

bourses

d'&eacute;tudes. Livrez-vous &agrave; une bonne analyse et &agrave; des comparaisons, car les

modalit&eacute;s particuli&egrave;res, notamment les frais d'administration, les frais de

liquidation et les

p&eacute;nalit&eacute;s de retrait, varient d'un r&eacute;gime &agrave; l'autre.



<p><font size=+1><b>Les fiducies</b></font>

<p>

<b>T</b>raditionnellement utilis&eacute;e par les familles riches comme abri fiscal, la

<b>fiducie familiale</b> est une convention de fiducie &eacute;tablie en bonne et due forme par

le truchement d'un avocat. M&ecirc;me si certaines dispositions fiscales

pr&eacute;f&eacute;rentielles ont

&eacute;t&eacute; abolies

dans le budget f&eacute;d&eacute;ral de 1995, les avantages consid&eacute;rables

d&eacute;coulant du

partage des revenus demeurent. Suivant les r&egrave;gles d'attribution du revenu, vous payez de

l'imp&ocirc;t sur les revenus d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts ou de dividendes, tandis que les gains en

capital sont

attribu&eacute;s &agrave; votre enfant.



<p><b>L</b>'un des moyens les plus simples d'&eacute;conomiser en vue de financer des

&eacute;tudes

sup&eacute;rieures est de cr&eacute;er une <b>fiducie implicite (ou

&lt;&lt;informelle&gt;&gt;).</b>

Avec ce type

de m&eacute;canisme, vous pouvez ouvrir un compte r&eacute;gulier de placement &lt;&lt;en

fiducie&gt;&gt; - sans &ecirc;tre tenu de nommer un b&eacuten&eacute;ficiaire. Vous

&ecirc;tes propri&eacute;taire des fonds, en gardez la ma&icirc;trise et y avez acc&egrave;s

&agrave; n'importe quel moment pour n'importe quelle raison. Vos cotisations ne sont

aucunement limit&eacute;es de par leur importance ni de par le genre de placement que vous

faites, et vous n'&ecirc;tes jamais p&eacute;nalis&eacute; si votre enfant ne poursuit pas

d'&eacute;tudes postsecondaires.



<p><b>L</b>a fiducie implicite peut &eacute;galement tirer parti des r&egrave;gles

d'attribution du revenu. Par cons&eacute;quent, les fonds mutuels dont l'objectif de placement est

de maximiser la croissance du capital &agrave; long terme et d'accorder une importance minime

au revenu d&eacute;gag&eacute; &agrave; court terme sont tr&egraves en demande pour ce type

de compte.



<p><b>L</b>orsque les parents placent les sommes qu'ils re&ccedil;oivent en allocations

familiales au nom de leur enfant, tous les revenus sont attribu&eacute;s &agrave; l'enfant. Ils

doivent donc conserver leurs re&ccedil;us puisque ceux-ci attestent que les sommes ont

&eacute;t&eacute; plac&eacute;es dans ces programmes.



<p><b>U</b>ne fois que votre enfant a 18 ans, l'&acirc;ge l&eacute;gal de la majorit&eacute;,

vous avez la possibilit&eacute; de r&eacute;enregistrer le compte au nom de votre enfant.

&Agrave; partir de ce moment, tous les revenus, y compris les int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts et les

dividendes, sont attribu&eacute;s &agrave; l'enfant. Si votre enfant a besoin de cet argent, il est

possible de mettre sur pied un plan de retrait mensuel tr&egrave;s pratique pour ses

d&eacute;penses courantes.

<b>V</b>oici l'histoire de Pierre et Nathalie. Chacun d&eacute;sirait mettre de l'argent de

c&ocirc;t&eacute; pour sa retraite. Elle a commenc&eacute; &agrave; &eacute;pargner 100 $ par

mois d&egrave;s l'&acirc;ge de 23 ans et ce, jusqu'&agrave; ses 31 ans. Elle avait ainsi

r&eacute;ussi &agrave; accumuler, durant 9 ans, une rondelette somme de 10 800 $. Le

rendement de son placement &eacute;tait de 8 % par ann&eacute;e, en moyenne, et nous

supposons que son placement maintiendra ce rendement jusqu'&agrave; ce qu'elle atteigne

l'&acirc;ge de 65 ans.



<p><b>Q</b>uant &agrave; Pierre, il n'a commenc&eacute; &agrave; investir qu'&agrave;

compter de l'&acirc;ge de 31 ans. Cette ann&eacute;e-l&agrave;, il investit 100 $ par mois, une

somme qu'il entend investir tous les mois jusqu'&agrave; ses 65 ans. Au moment de sa retraite, il

aura investi une somme de 42 000 $ et, tout comme Nathalie, le rendement annuel moyen sur son

placement aura &eacute;t&eacute; de 8 % pour chacune des 35 ann&eacute;es.



<p><b>&Agrave;</b> premi&egrave;re vue, l'on pourrait croire que Pierre, &agrave; 65 ans,

aura accumul&eacute; beaucoup plus d'argent que Nathalie. En fait, Pierre prendra sa retraite

avec 229 400 $ en main, alors que Nathalie aura accumul&eacute; 236 800 $. (Remarquez que si

Nathalie avait continu&eacute; &agrave; contribuer &agrave; son m&ecirc;me rythme de 100 $

par mois jusqu'&agrave; l'&acirc;ge de 65 ans, elle aurait r&eacute;ussi &agrave; accumuler une

somme de 450 478 $!)



<p><b>L</b>'histoire de Pierre et Nathalie illustre deux r&egrave;gles fondamentales dans

l'&eacute;tablissement d'une strat&eacute;gie d'enrichissement :<br><br>



<center><font size=+1>COMMENCEZ T&Ocirc;T</font><br>

<i><b>P</b>lus vous commencez t&ocirc;t &agrave; investir, plus vous accumulez

d'argent.</i><br><br>

<font size=+1>INVESTISSEZ R&Eacute;GULI&Egrave;REMENT</font>

<br><i><b>M</b>&ecirc;me une petite somme, si elle est investie

r&eacute;guli&egrave;rement, vous permettra d'accumuler de l'argent beaucoup plus vite que

vous pouvez l'imaginer.</i></center>

<HR>

<CENTER><H4><I>Pr&eacute;parer sa retraite est un objectif financier primordial pour

presque tous les Canadiens. Certains l'envisagent avec beaucoup d'espoir, d'autres

avec beaucoup de crainte -  mais ceux qui sont bien pr&eacute;par&eacute;s sont peu

nombreux. M&ecirc;me si vous &ecirc;tes jeune, un examen de votre situation pourrait

s'av&eacute;rer tr&egrave;s utile.</i></h4></center>

<hr>

<h3>COMBIEN VOUS FAUDRA-T-IL &Agrave; LA RETRAITE?</h3>

<b>D</b>es experts estiment qu'il vous faudra entre 60 % et 80 % du revenu que vous gagniez

avant la retraite pour maintenir le m&ecirc;me niveau de vie. Les personnes peu

endett&eacute;es n'auront besoin que de 60 % du revenu qu'elles touchaient avant la retraite,

tandis que celles qui aiment voyager ou ont des loisirs co&ucirc;teux pourraient avoir besoin

d'un revenu nettement plus &eacute;lev&eacute;.



<P><b>L</b>e tableau suivant vous donne une bonne id&eacute;e des &eacute;conomies

&agrave; r&eacute;aliser en fonction d'un revenu &agrave; la retraite souhait&eacute;, dans

l'hypoth&egrave;se o&ugrave; celle-ci s'&eacute;tale sur 20 ans. Par exemple, si vous comptez

prendre votre retraite dans 25 ans avec un revenu annuel de 30 000 $ pendant une p&eacute;riode

de 20 ans, il vous faudra investir chaque ann&eacute;e 4 029 $ &agrave; un taux

d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t annuel compos&eacute; de 8 %.

<hr>

<h3>GRILLE DE CALCUL POUR PLANIFIER SA RETRAITE</h3>



<P><CENTER><IMG ALIGN=bottom

SRC="fr-ret1.gif" Alt="Grille

de Calcul Pour Planifier Sa Retraite"></CENTER><br>



<p><b>L</b>'esp&eacute;rance de vie ne cesse d'augmenter. Ainsi, les hommes qui prennent

leur retraite &agrave; l'&acirc;ge de 65 ans peuvent esp&eacute;rer vivre neuf ans de plus, tandis

que les femmes qui la prennent au m&ecirc;me &acirc;ge peuvent esp&eacute;rer vivre 16 ans

de plus. Mais, que vous pr&eacute;voyiez de l&eacute;guer votre patrimoine aux &ecirc;tres qui

vous sont chers ou que vous &eacute;puisiez graduellement toutes vos &eacute;conomies de

retraite, il faudra tenir compte de l'inflation. M&ecirc;me avec un taux annuel d'inflation de

seulement 2 %, le dollar ne vaut plus que 0,74 $ au bout de 15 ans.

<hr>



<h3>SOURCES DE REVENU DE RETRAITE</h3>

<b>T</b>rois sources de revenu de retraite sont &agrave; envisager lorsque vous

&eacute;valuez vos besoins :<br>

<ol><li><b>R</b>ente d'&Eacute;tat Bien qu'une certaine forme de pension nous sera sans

doute vers&eacute;e par l'&Eacute;tat, nous ne pouvons plus compter sur les pouvoirs publics

pour assurer votre retraite. Face &agrave; l'endettement &eacute;lev&eacute; de l'&Eacute;tat et

&agrave; une population vieillissante, les experts estiment que les coffres du R&eacute;gime de

pensions du Canada seront vides en 2010 si rien n'est fait pour corriger la situation. Nous

pouvons nous attendre &agrave; des r&eacute;formes majeures dans les prochaines

ann&eacute;es. D&eacute;j&agrave;, la S&eacute;curit&eacute; de la vieillesse pr&eacute;voit

des dispositions de r&eacute;cup&eacute;ration de la pension pour les personnes &agrave;

revenu &eacute;lev&eacute;. Rien ne garantit que le seuil ne sera pas ramen&eacute; &agrave;

un niveau o&ugrave; seules les personnes &agrave; tr&egrave;s faible revenu toucheront une
pension de l'&Eacute;tat.<br><br>



<li><b>R</b>&eacute;gime de retraite de votre employeur Si vous

b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiez

d'un

r&eacute;gime de retraite d'employeur, voyez quelle sera l'importance de votre pension et

&agrave;

quel moment vous la toucherez. N'allez pas supposer que la rente servie par votre employeur

satisfera

&agrave; tous vos besoins &agrave; la retraite. Si vous avez souvent chang&eacute; d'emploi ou

quitt&eacute; le march&eacute; du travail pendant quelques ann&eacute;es, vous pourriez

n'avoir droit

qu'&agrave; une pension partielle.<br><br>



<li><b>&Eacute;</b>conomies personnelles Nous devrons nous en remettre de plus en plus

&agrave; nos &eacute;conomies personnelles pour nous constituer un revenu de retraite. Si votre

situation est comparable &agrave; celle de la plupart des Canadiens, la pension vers&eacute;e

par votre employeur et celle de l'&Eacute;tat totaliseront environ la moiti&eacute; de ce dont

vous aurez besoin. Le reste devra venir de vos &eacute;conomies personnelles, peut-&ecirc;tre

m&ecirc;me d'un travail &agrave; temps partiel.</ol>

<hr>

<h3>COMBLER LE FOSS&Eacute;</h3>

<b>V</b>ous devrez peut-&ecirc;tre vous serrer la ceinture, mais vos chances de r&eacute;ussir

seront plus grandes

si vous appliquez les strat&eacute;gies suivantes :<br><br>1. <b>C</b>ommencer le plus

t&ocirc;t possible, investir souvent et garder ses positions <br>L'argent s'accumule tr&egrave;s

vite

quand on le met de c&ocirc;t&eacute; et qu'il rapporte des int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts

compos&eacute;s. Si vous &eacute;conomisez 2 000 $ au d&eacute;but de chaque ann&eacute;e

&agrave; partir de l'&acirc;ge de 25 ans, vous vous retrouverez avec un capital de 404 141 $

(avant imp&ocirc;t) &agrave; 60 ans  - dans l'hypoth&egrave;se d'un taux de rendement annuel

moyen de 8 %. Si vous attendez &agrave; 35 ans, vous n'accumulerez que 172 702 $. Et si vous

attendez jusqu'&agrave; 45 ans, vous n'aurez plus que 65 500 $.



<h3>LE PLUS T&Ocirc;T SERA LE MIEUX</h3>

Plus T&ocirc;t  Sera le Mieux"></CENTER><br><br>



<P><B>U</B>n bon moyen de profiter de cette croissance est d'investir de petites sommes

&agrave; intervalles r&eacute;guliers par le biais d'un plan d'achat pr&eacute;autoris&eacute;.

Par exemple, la cotisation de 2 000 $ dont il a &eacute;t&eacute; question

pr&eacute;c&eacute;demment pourrait &ecirc;tre r&eacute;partie en versements hebdomadaires

de 38,46 $ pour plus de facilit&eacute;. Offert par la plupart des soci&eacute;t&eacute;s de

fonds mutuels, le plan d'achat pr&eacute;autoris&eacute; permet d'investir aussi peu que 25 $ par

fonds; cette somme est automatiquement pr&eacute;lev&eacute;e de votre compte de banque

&agrave; la fr&eacute;quence souhait&eacute;e : hebdomadaire, mensuelle, trimestrielle, ou

&agrave; la m&ecirc;me fr&eacute;quence que vos ch&egrave;ques de paie.



<p><b>G</b>arder ses placements &agrave; long terme est une autre fa&ccedil;on d'accumuler

de la richesse. Bien que certains investisseurs pourraient &ecirc;tre tent&eacute;s de retirer leurs

placements au moindre revers, ceux qui ont du succ&egrave;s savent que les march&eacute;s

sont cycliques et que la tendance &agrave; long terme a toujours &eacute;t&eacute; &agrave; la

hausse. Ils tol&egrave;rent les fluctuations &agrave; court terme et font appel &agrave; la

strat&eacute;gie &lt;&lt; acheter et conserver &gt;&gt; pour tirer parti des

int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts compos&eacute;s. 



<P><CENTER><IMG ALIGN=bottom

<H3>LA TENDANCE &Agrave;  LA HAUSSE</H3>

2. <b>R</b>&eacute;duire au minimum ses imp&ocirc;ts <br>Dans toute la mesure du

possible, laissez votre argent cro&icirc;tre en franchise d'imp&ocirc;t. Pour la plupart des

Canadiens, cela signifie qu'il faut se pr&eacute;valoir d'un r&eacute;gime enregistr&eacute;

d'&eacute;pargne-retraite (REER). Comme les cotisations diminuent d'autant votre revenu

imposable, vous payez moins d'imp&ocirc;t aujourd'hui - et votre argent produit des

int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts tant qu'il est plac&eacute;.</li>



<p>3. <b>I</b>nvestir avec sagesse<br> Bien que vous ne devriez pas accepter un niveau de

risque sup&eacute;rieur &agrave; celui que vous pouvez tol&eacute;rer, vous devriez favoriser

les placements offrant des perspectives de croissance relativement &eacute;lev&eacute;es 

&agrave; long terme. Aucun placement n'est exempt de risque, mais vous r&eacute;duisez le

risque au minimum si vous r&eacute;partissez vos &eacute;conomies dans diff&eacute;rents

v&eacute;hicules.



<p><b>P</b>our qu'il y ait diversification v&eacute;ritable, la plupart des conseillers financiers

recommandent de r&eacute;partir le capital dans les trois grandes cat&eacute;gories d'actif :

titres du march&eacute; mon&eacute;taire pour la s&eacute;curit&eacute;, obligations et

hypoth&egrave;ques pour le revenu r&eacute;gulier, actions pour la croissance. Gr&acirc;ce

&agrave; une judicieuse r&eacute;partition des cat&eacute;gories d'actif, vous pouvez combiner

certaines des caract&eacute;ristiques souhaitables de chacune et diminuer le niveau global de

risque.



<p><b>I</b>l est &eacute;galement sage de r&eacute;partir le risque en investissant &agrave;

l'&eacute;tranger. Puisque les &eacute;conomies, les monnaies et les march&eacute;s

&eacute;trangers en sont &agrave; des stades diff&eacute;rents du cycle &eacute;conomique, un

portefeuille bien diversifi&eacute; sur la sc&egrave;ne internationale est habituellement moins

volatil qu'un portefeuille r&eacute;serv&eacute; aux titres d'un pays. De plus, comme 97 % de la

capitalisation boursi&egrave;re mondiale se trouve &agrave; l'ext&eacute;rieur du Canada, les

placements &eacute;trangers peuvent accro&icirc;tre les perspectives de croissance de tout

portefeuille. Les REER peuvent placer jusqu'&agrave; 20 % de la valeur comptable (co&ucirc;t

d'origine) de leur r&eacute;gime dans des titres &eacute;trangers.



<p><b>B</b>eaucoup d'investisseurs saisissent l'importante notion de la diversification, mais

ont du mal &agrave; la mettre en pratique. Ainsi, il faudrait sans doute r&eacute;unir une

somme appr&eacute;ciable pour se b&acirc;tir un portefeuille bien diversifi&eacute;,

compos&eacute; de titres individuels - sans parler des commissions &agrave;

verser. Si vous ne voulez pas vous fier aux recommandations d'autrui, vous devrez consacrer

vous-m&ecirc;me des heures et des heures &agrave; la recherche et &agrave; l'analyse de vos

placements et &agrave; surveiller les titres. Pour ceux que les placements &eacute;trangers

int&eacute;ressent, l'acc&egrave;s aux march&eacute;s mondiaux pourrait se

r&eacute;v&eacute;ler encore plus difficile.



<p><b>P</b>our l'investisseur moyen, la diversification des placements est facile &agrave;

r&eacute;aliser avec des fonds mutuels canadiens et &eacute;trangers et avec des titres &agrave;

revenu fixe comme les CPG, les obligations, les obligations &agrave; coupons

d&eacute;tach&eacute;s, les titres hypoth&eacute;caires. &Eacute;tant donn&eacute; que les

fonds mutuels investissent dans une vaste panoplie de titres et sont g&eacute;r&eacute;s par des

experts en fonction d'objectifs sp&eacute;cifiques &agrave; atteindre, ils assurent une

diversification imm&eacute;diate. Vous pouvez investir dans une vaste gamme de titres et dans

plusieurs cat&eacute;gories d'actif avec seulement quelques fonds, ou encore vous pouvez

acheter un fonds &eacute;quilibr&eacute; qui investit dans les trois cat&eacute;gories d'actif.

Les coupures de nombreux titres &agrave; revenu fixe sont peu &eacute;lev&eacute;es, ce

qui simplifie la diversification en fonction du rendement, de l'&eacute;ch&eacute;ance et de la

qualit&eacute; du cr&eacute;dit.

<h3>CHOISIR UN REER</h3>

<b>I</b>l existe sans doute une formule qui vous convient parmi les REER de base, les REER

int&eacute;gr&eacute;s ou la gestion personnalis&eacute;e de vos placements.



<h4>Le REER de base</h4>

<b>O</b>ffert dans la plupart des institutions financi&egrave;res, le REER de base est

tr&egrave;s r&eacute;pandu, car le placement minimum est peu &eacute;lev&eacute;, et il n'y a

ni frais d'administration ni frais d'ouverture de compte. Les placements se limitent

habituellement &agrave; ceux offerts par l'institution financi&egrave;re. &Agrave;  la Banque

TD, vous avez le choix entre un RER - compte d'&eacute;pargne &agrave; int&eacute;r&ecirc;t

quotidien, un RER-CPG et un RER constitu&eacute; de fonds mutuels

sans frais d'acquisition Ligne Verte.



<h4>REER int&eacute;gr&eacute;</h4> 

<b>L</b>e REER int&eacute;gr&eacute; vous permet de regrouper dans un seul r&eacute;gime

divers placements d&eacute;tenus aupr&egrave;s de plusieurs institutions financi&egrave;res

diff&eacute;rentes. Vous offrant un plus vaste choix de placements et une tenue de registres

simplifi&eacute;e, ce REER vous permet de profiter au maximum du contenu &eacute;tranger,

dont le plafond est fix&eacute; &agrave; 20 %. Les frais d'administration annuels varient, mais

sont d&eacute;ductibles d'imp&ocirc;t s'ils sont pay&eacute;s en dehors du

r&eacute;gime.



<p><b>S</b>i vos placements totalisent 25 000 $ ou plus, vous aimerez ce que le compte

Accumulactif TD &agrave; offrir. Outre les fonds mutuels Ligne Verte, vous pourrez

d&eacute;tenir des fonds appartenant &agrave; d'autres soci&eacute;t&eacute;s de fonds

mutuels reconnues. Vous pourrez d&eacute;tenir aussi des placements &agrave;

revenu fixe, des titres du march&eacute; mon&eacute;taire et des liquidit&eacute;s - bref,

presque tous les types de placement &agrave; l'exception des actions individuelles, des produits

d&eacute;riv&eacute;s et des obligations de soci&eacute;t&eacute;s. Comme deux

r&eacute;gimes  -  l'un enregistr&eacute;, l'autre pas -  peuvent porter un seul num&eacute;ro

de compte, il devient d'autant plus facile de g&eacute;rer l'ensemble de votre portefeuille.



<p><b>L</b>es conseils de placement sont offerts gratuitement dans toutes les succursales TD

ou si vous t&eacute;l&eacute;phonez &agrave; la Ligne directe sans frais. Les frais

d'administration annuels s'&eacute;l&egrave;vent &agrave; 25 $, TPS

comprise (ajouter la TVQ au Qu&eacute;bec). Le compte Accumulactif TD est offert par Gestion

de Placements TD Inc. et par Services d'Investissement Ligne Verte.



<h4>REER g&eacute;r&eacute;</h4>

<b>I</b>l y a aussi le REER g&eacute;r&eacute; dont la gestion est confi&eacute;e &agrave;

un gestionnaire de portefeuille. Votre gestionnaire attitr&eacute; vous b&acirc;tira un

portefeuille sur mesure, fera les recherches et prendra les d&eacute;cisions de placement en votre

nom. Au fur et &agrave; mesure que les conditions du march&eacute; &eacute;volueront ou que

votre situation changera, il passera en revue votre portefeuille et le r&eacute;&eacute;quilibrera

automatiquement. Le REER g&eacute;r&eacute; est recommand&eacute; aux investisseurs

disposant d'un portefeuille d'au moins 100 000 $. Offert &agrave; prix comp&eacute;titif, ce

service est g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement d&eacute;ductible d'imp&ocirc;t.



<h3>PARTIR DU BON PIED</h3>

<b>V</b>ous n'avez pas encore commenc&eacute; &agrave; pr&eacute;parer votre retraite?

Alors, ne tardez plus. &Eacute;tablir un plan et s'y conformer pourraient exiger une certaine

discipline, mais il s'agit l&agrave; d'un bien modeste effort &agrave; consacrer pour vous assurer

que vous ne manquerez pas d'argent pour vos vieux jours.



<p><b>L</b>a Banque TD met &agrave; votre disposition plusieurs options pour vous faciliter

la t&acirc;che et pour vous aider &agrave; &eacute;conomiser en vue de cet objectif important.

<P><i><center><b>La diversification est l'art de ne pas placer tous ses oeufs dans le

m&ecirc;me panier; c'est un principe de base en mati&egrave;re de

placements.</b></center></i>

<hr>

<P><b>O</b>n a recours &agrave; la diversification pour une raison bien simple : aucun titre ne

rapporte un bon rendement &agrave; tous les stades du cycle &eacute;conomique. Vous pouvez

donc r&eacute;duire l'incidence d'un mauvais placement sur l'ensemble de votre portefeuille en

d&eacute;tenant une gamme vari&eacute;e de titres.  De cette mani&egrave;re, vous allez

problablement r&eacute;aliser un meilleur rendement que si vous vous &eacute;tiez

limit&eacute; aux titres les moins risqu&eacute;s. Pour bien saisir l'avantage de la

diversification, il faut tenir compte de trois aspects fondamentaux.



<h4>Le rendement</h4>

<b>D</b>e nos jours, il existe des centaines de placements regroup&eacute;s sous trois grandes

cat&eacute;gories d'actif : les titres du march&eacute; mon&eacute;taire, tels les bons du

Tr&eacute;sor, assurent la s&eacute;curit&eacute;; les CPG, les obligations et les

hypoth&egrave;ques procurent un revenu; les actions visent la croissance. Sur une longue

p&eacute;riode, les actions d&eacute;gagent les meilleurs rendements apr&egrave;s inflation,

suivies des obligations et des titres du march&eacute; mon&eacute;taire.



<P><b>N</b>e serait-il pas plus simple alors d'investir toutes ses &eacute;pargnes dans la

cat&eacute;gorie

d'actif qui rapporte le plus?  La raison en est le risque.



<h4>L'&eacute;quilibre risque/rendement</h4>

<b>E</b>n r&egrave;gle g&eacute;n&eacute;rale, plus un placement est risqu&eacute;, plus il

rapporte.  M&ecirc;me si les actions r&eacute;alisent les plus hauts rendements, leurs

fluctuations sont par ailleurs les plus importantes.  On risque donc d'essuyer une perte si l'on

vend des titres &agrave; un prix inf&eacute;rieur &agrave; celui qu'on a pay&eacute;.



<p><b>H</b>abituellement, les obligations sont plus stables, mais leurs cours varient dans le

sens inverse des taux d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t.



<p><b>O</b>n peut subir une perte si l'on vend une obligation avant qu'elle ne vienne &agrave;

&eacute;ch&eacute;ance.  Toutefois, on en retire toujours la valeur nominate si on la conserve

jusqu'&agrave; 1'&eacute;ch&eacute;ance.  Quant aux titres du march&eacute;

mon&eacute;taire, leurs cours sont les plus stables, mais leurs rendements

sont g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement moins &eacute;lev&eacute;s.



<P><center>

</center>



<h4>La gestion du risque</h4>

<b>V</b>ous trouverez ci-dessous les risques les plus courants ainsi que la fa&ccedil;on de les

contrebalancer. Ces risques existent &agrave; divers degr&eacute;s, selon la nature des

placements. Ensemble, ils forment ce qu'on appelle le risque total : c'est la volatilit&eacute; du

rendement total d'un placement sur une p&eacute;riode donn&eacute;e.<br><br>

<h4>Le cycle &eacute;conomique</h4>

<b>T</b>outes les &eacute;conomies connaissent des p&eacute;riodes d'expansion et de

contraction. Aux divers stades du cycle &eacute;conomique, certains placements se

comporteront mieux que d'autres. Par exemple, en p&eacute;riode de reprise

&eacute;conomique, les soci&eacute;t&eacute;s enregistreront d'excellents

b&eacute;n&eacute;fices et le cours des actions grimpera; pendant ce temps, si les taux

d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t se mettent &agrave; monter, les obligations vont glisser. La hausse des

taux d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t favorise les d&eacute;tenteurs de bons du Tr&eacute;sor, mais

l'inflation qui caract&eacute;rise souvent une p&eacute;riode d'expansion risque d'affaiblir les

rendements.



<p><center>

<img src="fr-div3.gif">

</center>



<P><b>S</b>i tel est le cas, pourquoi ne placerait-on pas tout son argent dans la

cat&eacute;gorie d'actif la plus performante &agrave; chaque stade du cycle

&eacute;conomique? Le d&eacute;fi est de taille. Nous savons que les cycles

&eacute;conomiques se r&eacute;p&egrave;tent, mais chaque cycle est diff&eacute;rent et dure

en moyenne de quatre &agrave; sept ans. Ajoutons &agrave; cela les perturbations qui secouent

de temps en temps les march&eacute;s; il devient alors tr&egrave;s difficile de pr&eacute;voir

les cycles avec certitude.



<p><b>E</b>n revanche, peu importe le stade du cycle &eacute;conomique, il y aura toujours

une cat&eacute;gorie d'actif qui se comportera mieux que les autres. Au lieu d'essayer d'anticiper

le cycle, il est plus judicieux d'investir dans chacune des cat&eacute;gories d'actif.

<hr>

<h3>LE PORTEFEUILLE &Eacute;QUILIBR&Eacute;</h3>

<b>E</b>n r&eacute;partissant ses placements entre diff&eacute;rentes cat&eacute;gories

d'actif, on r&eacute;duit les risques tout en augmentant le potentiel de croissance. Le graphique

ci-dessous illustre la croissance d'un millier de dollars de 1959 &agrave; 1995. Les actions, les

obligations et les bons du Tr&eacute;sor ont &eacute;volu&eacute; sensiblement comme

pr&eacute;vu : les actions ont progress&eacute; le plus, suivies des obligations et des bons du

Tr&eacute;sor. Mais observez le portefeuille &eacute;quilibr&eacute; : il a enregistr&eacute; 82

% de la croissance du portefeuille d'actions, avec moins de volatilit&eacute;.



<p><center>

<img src="fr-div4.gif">

</center>

<hr>

<h3>TIRER LE MEILLEUR PARTI DE LA DIVERSIFICATION</h3>

<p><b> V</b>oici trois fa&ccedil;ons de consolider son portefeuille par la

diversification :



<h4>Diversifier entre les cat&eacute;gories d'actif</h4>



<b>P</b>eu importe le stade du cycle &eacute;conomique, une cat&eacute;gorie d'actif

surpassera toujours les autres.  En r&eacute;partissant ses &eacute;pargnes entre les diverses

cat&eacute;gories d'actif, on r&eacute;duit le risque de faire un mauvais placement &agrave; un

mauvais moment.



<h4>Diversifier au sein de chaque cat&eacute;gorie d'actif</h4>

<b>P</b>our r&eacute;duire encore le risque, il faut varier les placements dans chaque

cat&eacute;gorie d'actif.  M&ecirc;me si les titres d'une m&ecirc;me cat&eacute;gorie ont

tendance &agrave; se comporter de la m&ecirc;me fa&ccedil;on, il est possible que l'un d'eux

fasse pi&egrave;tre figure pour des raisons particuli&egrave;res.  Par exemple, le

march&eacute; boursier pourrait &ecirc;tre en hausse, mais les rumeurs entourant les faibles

b&eacute;n&eacute;fices d'une soci&eacute;t&eacute; peuvent faire d&eacute;gringoler le titre.



<p><b>L</b>e volet &lt;&lt; march&eacute; mon&eacute;taire &gt;&gt; de votre portefeuille

peut renfermer des bons du Tr&eacute;sor et un fonds du march&eacute; mon&eacute;taire. 

Dans la cat&eacute;gorie &lt;&lt; revenu &gt;&gt;, vous pourriez d&eacute;tenir des CPG et des

obligations d'&Eacute;tat, dont les &eacute;ch&eacute;ances sont &eacute;tal&eacute;es.  Et

dans la section &lt;&lt; croissance &gt;&gt;, vous pourriez joindre aux valeurs s&ucirc;res des

actions de petites entreprises et r&eacute;partir les titres entre plusieurs secteurs

d'activit&eacute;.



<h4>Diversifier &agrave; l'&eacute;chelle mondiale</h4>



<b>&Eacute;</b>tant donn&eacute; que les &eacute;conomies, les march&eacute;s et les

devises des pays &eacute;trangers fluctuent selon des cycles diff&eacute;rents de celui que

conna&icirc;t le Canada, Un portefeuille comportant des placements internationaux est mieux

prot&eacute;g&eacute; contre les baisses lorsqu'un pays &eacute;prouve des difficult&eacute;s. 

C'est pourquoi un portefeuille diversifi&eacute; &agrave; l'&eacute;chelle mondiale est

habituellement moins volatil.

<h3>PASSEZ &Agrave; L'ACTION</h3>



<b>L</b>e Mod&egrave;le  de r&eacute;partition d'actif de TD peut vous aider &agrave;

<center><h4><i>Le march&eacute; boursier est en hausse constante. Vous guettez le moment

propice et, convaincu que la tendance va se maintenir, vous investissez. Peu apr&egrave;s, le

march&eacute; plonge. Voyant la valeur de votre placement s'effriter, vous vous r&eacute;signez

&agrave; vendre vos titres pour limiter vos pertes.</i>



<p>Du d&eacute;j&agrave; vu? Si vous avez d&eacute;j&agrave; connu cette

exp&eacute;rience, c'est que vous agissez suivant une m&eacute;thode qui vous m&egrave;ne

presque fatalement &agrave; acheter lorsque les cours sont pratiquement au plus haut et

&agrave; vendre lorsqu'ils sont presque au plus creux. Vous &ecirc;tes alors assur&eacute; de

perdre de l'argent. Y a-t-il une autre solution?</h4></center>

<hr>

<H3>LES PLACEMENTS SYST&Eacute;MATIQUES</H3>



<b>P</b>lut&ocirc;t que d'investir votre argent tout d'un coup (et de vous inqui&eacute;ter de ce

que le march&eacute; puisse se retourner contre vous), les experts vous conseillent plut&ocirc;t

d'investir un montant fixe, &agrave; intervalles r&eacute;guliers - mensuellement ou

trimestriellement, par exemple -, sans vous pr&eacute;occuper des humeurs des march&eacute;s

financiers.



<p><b>C</b>'est ce que l'on appelle la technique de la moyenne d'achat. Cette technique repose,

contrairement &agrave; ce que son nom compliqu&eacute; laisse pr&eacute;sager, sur un

concept fort simple : quand les prix sont en hausse, le montant fixe de votre placement

ach&egrave;te moins d'unit&eacute;s d'un titre donn&eacute;; quand les prix sont en baisse, le

m&ecirc;me montant en ach&egrave;te davantage. Cette technique ne vous garantit ni profits

ni protection contre des pertes, mais elle permet d'abaisser le prix d'achat moyen de chaque

unit&eacute;.



<hr>

<h3>EN VOICI LE FONCTIONNEMENT</h3>

<b>D</b>isons que vous d&eacute;cidez d'investir 100 $ par mois dans un fonds mutuel. En

janvier, les unit&eacute;s de ce fonds sont offertes &agrave; 20 $ chacune; votre placement de

100 $ vous permet donc d'acheter cinq unit&eacute;s.  En f&eacute;vrier, le prix chute &agrave;

10 $ l'unit&eacute;; vous vous trouvez alors &agrave; acheter 10 unit&eacute;s de ce

m&ecirc;me fonds. Disons qu'au mois de mai, votre fonds remonte fortement, et le prix de

l'unit&eacute; atteint maintenant 30 $. &Agrave;  ce prix, votre 100 $ ne vous obtient que trois

unit&eacute;s et un tiers du fonds. En bout de ligne, vous avez achet&eacute; un total de 30

unit&eacute;s au prix moyen de 16,67 $, alors que le prix moyen du march&eacute; s'est

&eacute;tabli &agrave; 19 $. Ainsi, la technique de la moyenne d'achat a r&eacute;duit le

co&ucirc;t moyen de chacune de vos unit&eacute;s. <i>(Voir tableau).</i>



<center><H4>PROGRAMME DE MOYENNE D'ACHAT</H4><br>



<IMG SRC="fr-dol1a.gif">

</center><br><br>



<hr><h3>NE VOUS LAISSEZ PAS GUIDER PAR L'&Eacute;MOTIVIT&Eacute;</h3>

<b>I</b>l ne faut pas oublier que la technique de la moyenne d'achat n'emp&ecirc;che pas les

pertes lorsque les march&eacute;s sont &agrave; la baisse, pas plus qu'elle n'augmente les gains

lorsqu'ils sont &agrave; la hausse. Il s'agit plut&ocirc;t d'une discipline, vous permettant de vous

d&eacute;tacher &eacute;motivement du processus d'investissement comme tel.

<hr>                                

<h3>L'ANTICIPATION N'EST PAS TOUT</h3> <br>



 <center>

<IMG SRC="fr-doll2.gif">

</center><br><br>



<P><center><font size=-1><i>Dans cet exemple, votre rendement annuel passe de 9,65 %

&agrave; 6,12 % si vous aviez manqu&eacute; les 10 meilleures journ&eacute;es durant cette

p&eacute;riode de 13 ans. M&ecirc;me si la strat&eacute;gie &lt;&lt; acheter et conserver

&gt;&gt; suppose que vous prenez part &agrave; toutes les bonnes et mauvaises

journ&eacute;es, vous gagnez en bout de ligne puisque vous r&eacute;alisez un rendement

beaucoup plus &eacute;lev&eacute;.</i></font></center>



<p><b>A</b>u lieu de chercher &agrave; anticiper les fluctuations des march&eacute;s, en

d&eacute;pla&ccedil;ant vos placements par crainte ou par cupidit&eacute;, vous n'avez

qu'&agrave; participer r&eacute;guli&egrave;rement &agrave; votre programme de

placement. &Agrave; la longue, le simple fait d'&ecirc;tre pr&eacute;sent dans le

march&eacute; peut se r&eacute;v&eacute;ler beaucoup plus d&eacute;terminant que le

moment o&ugrave; vous y &ecirc;tes arriv&eacute;. En investissant de mani&egrave;re

syst&eacute;matique, vous tirez profit des avantages &agrave; long terme associ&eacute;s

&agrave; un portefeuille de valeurs mobili&egrave;res.

<hr>

<h3>DES PLACEMENTS, OUI, MAIS LESQUELS?</h3>

<b>L</b>a technique de la moyenne d'achat convient &agrave; presque tous les types de

placement. Certains investisseurs l'utilisent pour acheter directement des actions ou des

obligations, mais les co&ucirc;ts reli&eacute;s &agrave; l'achat de quelques titres sont

plut&ocirc;t &eacute;lev&eacute;s, et l'on peut difficilement b&acirc;tir un portefeuille

diversifi&eacute; avec seulement quelques titres. C'est pourquoi la technique de la moyenne

d'achat est souvent utilis&eacute;e pour acqu&eacute;rir des unit&eacute;s de fonds mutuels

mixtes, compos&eacute;s d'actions et d'obligations, offrant &agrave; la fois un portefeuille

diversifi&eacute; et une gestion professionnelle &agrave; un co&ucirc;t tr&egrave;s abordable.

<hr>

<h3>LA PREMI&Egrave;RE &Eacute;TAPE</h3>

<b>A</b>vant de commencer, r&eacute;pondez d'abord &agrave; ces deux questions : &lt;&lt; 

Combien d'argent puis-je placer? &gt;&gt; et &lt;&lt; &Agrave;  quelle fr&eacute;quence

devrais-je investir? &gt;&gt;. Afin de d&eacute;terminer le montant de votre placement, vous

devrez d'abord &eacute;tablir quels sont vos revenus, vos d&eacute;penses, vos objectifs

financiers g&eacute;n&eacute;raux et votre degr&eacute; de tol&eacute;rance au risque. Puisque

la participation &agrave; un programme de placement syst&eacute;matique entra&icirc;ne

l'acquisition r&eacute;guli&egrave;re d'unit&eacute;s, il est prudent de bien &eacute;valuer

votre capacit&eacute; d'investir en tenant compte des fluctuations de votre situation

financi&egrave;re avant de vous engager. Quant &agrave; la fr&eacute;quence, il semble que les

versements mensuels ou trimestriels jouissent de la faveur de la plupart des investisseurs,

bien que nombreux sont ceux qui choisissent de faire co&iuml;ncider le montant de l'acquisition

d'unit&eacute;s de placement et leur p&eacute;riode de paie. Le choix des versements annuels ou

semestriels, sans annuler les effets de la volatilit&eacute; &agrave; court terme des

march&eacute;s, procurera &agrave; long terme les avantages de la technique de la moyenne

d'achat.

<hr>

<h3>LES VIREMENTS AUTOMATIQUES</h3>

<b>L</b>a fa&ccedil;on la plus facile de tirer profit de la technique de la moyenne d'achat est

de proc&eacute;der par virement automatique. Gr&acirc;ce au Plan d'achat

pr&eacute;autoris&eacute; TD, vous pouvez nous demander de pr&eacute;lever

syst&eacute;matiquement de votre compte de banque aussi peu que 25 $ &agrave; la

fr&eacute;quence qui vous convient - soit trimestrielle, mensuelle, hebdomadaire ou selon votre

p&eacute;riode de paie - et d'investir cette somme dans les fonds mutuels Ligne Verte de votre

choix. Vous pouvez &agrave; tout moment modifier le montant du pr&eacute;l&egrave;vement,

la fr&eacute;quence des achats et les fonds dans lesquels vous investissez.



<p><b>E</b>n plus de vous permettre de tirer profit de la moyenne d'achat, le Plan d'achat

pr&eacute;autoris&eacute;  constitue un moyen &eacute;conomique de b&acirc;tir votre

patrimoine. Pour en savoir davantage, rendez-vous &agrave; votre succursale TD ou composez le

num&eacute;ro de la Ligne directe sans frais, soit le 1-800-363-1167.

<H2> LA SENSIBILIT&Eacute; AUX PRIX</H2>



<P><b>C</b>ertains investisseurs &eacute;valuent le rendement de tous leurs

&eacute;l&eacute;ments d'actif - actions, obligations ou bons du Tr&eacute;sor - d'apr&egrave;s

la m&ecirc;me mesure de rendement, &agrave; savoir l'&eacute;volution du cours ou du prix.

Erreur. Pour vous en convaincre, attardons-nous au rendement total r&eacute;alis&eacute; par

diverses cat&eacute;gories d'actif et voyons comment ce rendement devrait prendre en compte

non seulement l'&eacute;volution du prix, mais le revenu qui en d&eacute;coule et les

fluctuations pertinentes des cours du change, s'il y a lieu. 



<p><b>C</b>ertains placements s'assimilent &agrave; un d&eacute;p&ocirc;t dans un compte

bancaire, car ils proposent un rendement donn&eacute; - un revenu - sur les capitaux investis.

Les bons du Tr&eacute;sor, les fonds ax&eacute;s sur ces bons et les fonds du march&eacute;

mon&eacute;taire sont des placements liquides qui comportent peu de risques. La seule

mani&egrave;re d'&eacute;valuer ce type de placement, c'est d'en &eacute;tudier le revenu

(Illustration n<font size=-2>o</font> 1), car le prix des bons du Tr&eacute;sor ne varie

gu&egrave;re (les fonds du march&eacute; mon&eacute;taire de la Banque TD sont

g&eacute;r&eacute;s de mani&egrave;re &agrave; maintenir un prix unitaire constant). Ainsi, le

rendement total correspond au revenu que rapporte votre placement. 



<p><b>S</b>i vous optez pour des placements &agrave; revenu &agrave; court terme dans

une devise autre que le dollar canadien, toute variation du cours du huard par rapport &agrave;

cette devise aura un impact sur votre rendement total. L'&eacute;volution des cours du change

aura une incidence tant sur le revenu que sur le principal. 





<p><center>

<img src="fr-pric1.gif"></center>



<P><center>

<img src="fr-pric2.gif">

</center>



<p><b>L</b>es bons du Tr&eacute;sor et les fonds du march&eacute; mon&eacute;taire

peuvent d&eacute;gager des revenus int&eacute;ressants et un rendement all&eacute;chant

lorsque les taux d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t sont &eacute;lev&eacute;s. Par contre, leur rendement

historique est re l at ivement faible par rapport &agrave; celui des actions et des obligations. En

obtenant la tranquillit&eacute; d'esprit que procure un placement &agrave; faible risque assorti

de rentr&eacute;es r&eacute;guli&egrave;res de revenus d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t, vous renoncez

aux possibilit&eacute;s de plus-value qu'un placement en actions ou en obligations peut fournir.

Le rendement total d'une obligation ou d'un fonds obligataire se compose &agrave; la fois du

revenu du titre et de la variation de son cours, c'est-&agrave;-dire sa plus-value/moins-value

&eacute;ventuelle. Alors que le cours d'une obligation peut fluctuer, l'&eacute;l&eacute;ment

&lt;&lt;revenu&gt;&gt; demeure relativement r&eacute;gulier parce qu'il s'agit d'un placement

ax&eacute; sur le revenu.



<P><b>C</b>omme le montre l'illustration n<font size=-2>o</font> 2, les obligations procurent

depuis 1980 un revenu moyen d'environ 10 %. Durant cette p&eacute;riode, les obligations ont

syst&eacute;matiquement donn&eacute; un rendement total positif, m&ecirc;me pendant les

ann&eacute;es o&ugrave; leur cours a fortement chut&eacute;, comme en 1981 et 1987. Sauf

de rares exceptions notables (1982, par exemple), c'est le revenu plut&ocirc;t que la plus-value

qui compte pour la plus grande partie du rendement total d'une obligation ou d'un fonds

obligataire. 



<p><center>

<img src="fr-pric3.gif"></center>



<P><b>L</b>e cours d'une obligation varie en fonction des taux d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t. Lorsque

ces derniers montent, le cours obligataire diminue. Les titres obligataires sont souvent un bon

moyen de diversifier votre portefeuille &agrave; long terme, car les cours des obligations sont

historiquement moins volatils que ceux des actions et, en contrepartie d'un risque un peu plus

&eacute;lev&eacute;, l'obligation offre la possibilit&eacute; d'un rendement plus avantageux

qu'un placement en bons du Tr&eacute;sor ou dans un fonds du march&eacute;

mon&eacute;taire. Pourtant, si les obligations comportent moins de risques qu'un placement en

actions, elles offrent aussi moins de possibilit&eacute;s de croissance &agrave; long terme

(plus-value) que les actions. 



<p><b>C</b>omme c'est le cas avec les obligations, le rendement total d'une action comprend

deux volets : la variation du cours (plus-value ou moins-value) et le revenu (ou dividende)

vers&eacute; &agrave; m&ecirc;me le b&eacute;n&eacute;fice annuel de l'entreprise. &Agrave;

l'instar d'une obligation, l'action peut conna&icirc;tre une plus-value ou subir une moins-value.

Contrairement au bon du Tr&eacute;sor et &agrave; l'obligation, l'action donne droit &agrave;

un revenu n&eacute;gligeable. Par contre, comme en t&eacute;moigne l'illustration n<font

size=-2>o</font> 3, m&ecirc;me lorsque les cours des titres et le rendement total ont

diminu&eacute;, l'indice TSE 300 n'a jamais cess&eacute; de verser un revenu aux

actionnaires. Il s'agit d'une performance remarquable compte tenu de la rigueur de la

derni&egravere r&eacute;cession. 



<p><b>L</b>es variations du cours du change ont une incidence indirecte sur certaines actions

canadiennes. Par exemple, toute entreprise qui exerce une part appr&eacute;ciable de ses

activit&eacute;s dans le domaine des exportations ou qui tire un revenu important de

l'&eacute;tranger doit composer avec les fluctuations du cours du dollar canadien. La

r&eacute;ussite &agrave; cet &eacute;gard influe sur la tenue d'ensemble et est

refl&eacute;t&eacute;e dans le rendement total des titres. 



<p><b>C</b>ependant, la plus grande partie du rendement total d'une action provient de

l'&eacute;volution de son cours. C'est ce qui procure aux actions de meilleures

possibilit&eacute;s de plus-value, mais aussi une plus grande volatilit&eacute; et, de ce fait, un

plus grand risque. Historiquement, les actions donnent un meilleur rendement que la plupart

des autres &eacute;l&eacute;ments d'actif financiers. 



<p><b>P</b>our calculer le rendement total des titres internationaux, il faut ajouter un

troisi&egrave;me facteur aux calculs pour les actions et obligations : les fluctuations des cours

du change. 



<p><b>L</b>es possibilit&eacute;s de profit sur les march&eacute;s mondiaux peuvent

&ecirc;tre tr&egrave;s &eacute;lev&eacute;es. L'&eacute;conomie d'un pays &eacute;tranger

peut conna&icirc;tre une croissance formidable, et l'appr&eacute;ciation de la devise locale

peut s'ajouter aux plus-values boursi&egrave;res (Illustration n<font size=-2>o</font> 4). Ces

march&eacute;s sont &eacute;galement les plus risqu&eacute;s pour les placements, car la

croissance rapide peut s'accompagner d'une certaine instabilit&eacute;. De plus,

l'&eacute;l&eacute;ment &lt;&lt;revenu&gt;&gt; de ces actions internationales est

habituellement inf&eacute;rieur &agrave; celui des titres de l'indice TSE 300; enfin,

&eacute;tant donn&eacute; la volatilit&eacute; de ces march&eacute;s (surtout ceux qu'on dit

&lt;&lt;&eacute;mergents&gt;&gt;), on ne peut garantir la r&eacute;gularit&eacute; du revenu. 



<p><b>A</b>lors qu'un placement sur ces march&eacute;s peut rapporter davantage qu'un

titre du march&eacute; mon&eacute;taire canadien, une action ou une obligation canadienne, il

est certes plus volatil. Ce type de placement convient &agrave; l'investisseur qui ne craint pas

de prendre un grand risque pour avoir la possibilit&eacute; de toucher un gros profit. D'autre

part, l'investisseur prudent aura peut-&ecirc;tre int&eacute;r&ecirc;t &agrave; ajouter une faible

proportion de ces placements &agrave; son portefeuille pour en accro&icirc;tre la dimension

g&eacute;ographique.



<p><center>

<img src="fr-pric4.gif"></center>



<p><b>Assurez-vous d'&ecirc;tre bien &agrave; l'aise avec le genre de rendement que

rapportera votre placement.</b>



<p>Selon la cat&eacute;gorie de l'actif, le prix peut n'&ecirc;tre qu'un facteur parmi plusieurs

qui entrent dans le calcul du rendement total du placement. Dans le cas des bons du

Tr&eacute;sor et des fonds du march&eacute; mon&eacute;taire, il n'entre m&ecirc;me pas en

ligne de compte. 



<p><b>O</b>utre le rendement d'ensemble, vous devriez tenir compte de l'apport d'un

placement donn&eacute; &agrave; votre portefeuille global, c'est-&agrave;-dire &agrave; la

r&eacute;alisation de votre strat&eacute;gie financi&egrave;re &agrave; long terme. Par

exemple, dans un portefeuille &eacute;quilibr&eacute;, vous pouvez toucher un revenu

r&eacute;gulier tout en ayant la possibilit&eacute; d'un rendement plus int&eacute;ressant offert

par les placements plus risqu&eacute;s. Autrement dit, vous pouvez profiter &agrave; la fois

d'un revenu et d'une plus-value et r&eacute;duire le degr&eacute; global de risque de vos

placements - <b>en m&ecirc;me temps.</b>

<h2>DES STRAT&Eacute;GIES DE PLACEMENT INFAILLIBLES</h2>



<p><b>P</b>our investir r&eacute;guli&egrave;rement, il suffit de placer de petites sommes

&agrave; intervalles r&eacute;guliers, quelle que soit la conjoncture des march&eacute;s.

Pratique et abordable, cette d&eacute;marche syst&eacute;matique peut vous aider &agrave;

diminuer le risque et &agrave; accro&icirc;tre votre patrimoine avec le temps. Mais ce n'est pas

tout. Si vous pr&eacute;f&eacute;rez jouer un r&ocirc;le plus actif, nous vous proposons les

trois variantes suivantes :



<h3>MOYENNE D'ACHAT PROGRESSIVE</h3>

<b>E</b>ssentiellement, la moyenne d'achat consiste &agrave; placer une somme fixe

&agrave; intervalles r&eacute;guliers, par exemple 100 $ au d&eacute;but de chaque mois.

Vous achetez un plus grand nombre d'unit&eacute;s lorsque le prix est faible et un moins grand

nombre, lorsqu'il est &eacute;lev&eacute;. Cette technique ne garantit pas un profit ni ne

prot&egrave;ge contre les pertes, mais elle permet g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement de

r&eacute;duire, avec le temps, le prix unitaire moyen. La moyenne d'achat dite progressive vise

pour sa part &agrave; acc&eacute;l&eacute;rer l'&eacute;pargne et &agrave; &eacute;viter les

effets de l'inflation. Vous augmentez p&eacute;riodiquement vos cotisations d'un pourcentage

fixe, par exemple 5 % par ann&eacute;e. Votre placement fructifie donc plus rapidement et

vous conservez une longueur d'avance sur l'inflation.

<P><font size=-1><i><center>Au terme de 20 ans, le placement total est de 39 679 $, et le

capital accumul&eacute; s'&eacute;tablit &agrave; 107 947,46 $, ce qui repr&eacute;sente une

croissance globale de 68 268 $ ou 10,44 % par an.</center></I></font>



<h3>MOYENNE D'ACHAT BAS&Eacute;E SUR LA VALEUR</h3>

<b>L</b>a somme que vous placez est d&eacute;termin&eacute;e ici par la valeur du

placement. Supposons que vous &eacute;pargnez 100 $ par mois. Vous placez donc 100 $ le

premier mois. Le prix unitaire augmente et la valeur de votre fonds atteint 105 $ le mois

suivant. Vous placez alors la somme de 95 $ le deuxi&egrave;me mois, de sorte que la valeur

totale de votre placement est de 200 $. Par ailleurs, si votre placement chute &agrave; 185 $ le

mois suivant, vous devrez alors investir 115 $. La moyenne d'achat bas&eacute;e sur la valeur

est une m&eacute;thode efficace pour atteindre vos buts, car vous versez une cotisation

sup&eacute;rieure lorsque les prix sont faibles et inf&eacute;rieure, lorsqu'ils sont

&eacute;lev&eacute;s.

<P><font size=-1><i><center>Au terme de 20 ans, le placement total est de 23 751 $, et le

capital accumul&eacute; s'&eacute;tablit &agrave; 78 432 $, ce qui repr&eacute;sente une

croissance globale de 54 681 $ ou 10,77 % par an.</center></i></font>



<h3>PROGRAMME DE RAPPORT CONSTANT</h3>

<b>C</b>ette m&eacute;thode fait appel &agrave; une d&eacute;marche

&eacute;quilibr&eacute;e. Vous d&eacute;terminez d'abord la composition de votre portefeuille

et la somme &agrave; investir. Par exemple, si d'apr&egrave;s notre Mod&egrave;le de

r&eacute;partition d'actif vous appartenez &agrave; la cat&eacute;gorie &lt;&lt;Revenu et

croissance mod&eacute;r&eacute;e&gt;&gt;, vous devriez opter pour la composition d'actif

suivante : croissance - 40 %, revenu - 55 % et march&eacute; mon&eacute;taire - 5 %. Votre

premi&egrave;re cotisation est r&eacute;partie d'apr&egrave;s ce ratio. La seconde

d&eacute;pendra de la variation du rapport au cours de la p&eacute;riode. Si le prix du fonds

d'actions augmente, il vous faudra investir davantage dans les deux autres fonds pour

conserver la proportion 40-55-5. Lorsque vous r&eacute;partissez la somme &agrave; investir

entre plusieurs fonds, vous diminuez la volatilit&eacute; de votre portefeuille tout en

r&eacute;duisant le prix unitaire moyen.



<h3>PASSEZ &Agrave; L'ACTION</h3>

<b>Q</b>ue vous soyez &agrave; la recherche d'une m&eacute;thode simple ou plus active

d'investir, renseignez-vous sur notre Plan d'achat pr&eacute;autoris&eacute; (PAP). Vous

pouvez placer aussi peu que 25 $ par fonds. Cette somme sera automatiquement

pr&eacute;lev&eacute;e de votre compte de banque &agrave; la fr&eacute;quence de votre

choix : hebdomadaire, mensuelle ou trimestrielle. 



<p><b>P</b>uisque vous pouvez modifier le montant et la fr&eacute;quence &agrave; tout

moment, ce plan s'av&egrave;re tout indiqu&eacute; pour mettre en application la moyenne

d'achat progressive. La moyenne d'achat bas&eacute;e sur la valeur ou le programme

&agrave; rapport constant sont tout aussi faciles &agrave; appliquer. Vous fixez un montant

minimum, puis vous l'augmentez au besoin en communiquant avec notre Ligne directe sans

frais. Si vous ne savez pas combien investir pour atteindre votre objectif, adressez-vous

&agrave; une succursale TD ou t&eacute;l&eacute;phonez &agrave; la Ligne directe sans frais

pour obtenir notre Grille de calcul PAP.

<CENTER><H4><i>La planification fiscale est un aspect important, souvent

n&eacute;glig&eacute;, de toute strat&eacute;gie de placement. Attardons-nous aux principaux

aspects qui concernent les fonds mutuels.</i></H4></CENTER>

 <HR>

<h3>TRAITEMENT FISCAL DES DISTRIBUTIONS</h3>

<b>L</b>es fonds mutuels transmettent, sous forme de distributions, le revenu net aux

d&eacute;tenteurs d'unit&eacute;s. Selon le type de fonds que vous d&eacute;tenez, vous

pourriez recevoir des int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts, des dividendes, des gains en capital ou des revenus

de sources &eacute;trang&egrave;res. Chaque ann&eacute;e, les administrateurs de fonds

mutuels &eacute;mettent un feuillet T3 (un relev&eacute; 16 au Qu&eacute;bec) sur lequel

figure le type de revenu ainsi que le montant &agrave; inscrire dans votre d&eacute;claration.



<p><b>L</b>orsque vous investissez dans des fonds mutuels, n'oubliez pas que le traitement

fiscal de vos placements d&eacute;pend de la nature de leur rendement.



<ul><li>Les int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts sont pleinement imposables.<br><br>

<li>Les dividendes de soci&eacute;t&eacute;s canadiennes sont admissibles au cr&eacute;dit

d'imp&ocirc;t pour dividendes.<br><br>

<li>Les gains en capital sont imposables &agrave; 75 %, et on peut porter 75 % des pertes en

capital en diminution des gains en capital.<br><br>

<li>Les revenus de sources &eacute;trang&egrave;res sont pleinement imposables; les

imp&ocirc;ts &eacute;trangers pr&eacute;lev&eacute;s sur ces revenus peuvent &ecirc;tre

admissibles au cr&eacute;dit pour imp&ocirc;t &eacute;tranger ou peuvent &ecirc;tre

d&eacute;ductibles du revenu.

</ul>



<p><b>L</b>es fonds mutuels distribuent des int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts ou des dividendes au moins

une fois l'an; bon nombre le font &agrave; tous les trois mois. En temps normal, les gains en

capital sont distribu&eacute;s en fin d'ann&eacute;e. Vous &ecirc;tes tenu de d&eacute;clarer les

distributions comme revenu, qu'elles soient vers&eacute;es en esp&egrave;ces ou

r&eacute;investies dans l'achat d'autres unit&eacute;s.



<p><b>L</b>es distributions provenant des unit&eacute;s de fonds mutuels d&eacute;tenues

dans un abri fiscal - comme un REER ou un FERR - sont exemptes d'imp&ocirc;t. Cependant,

lorsque vous retirez des sommes d'un r&eacute;gime comme celui-l&agrave;, elles sont

pleinement impos&eacute;es comme s'il s'agissait d'un revenu ordinaire, sans &eacute;gard

&agrave; son origine.

<hr>

<h3>GAINS EN CAPITAL</h3>

<b>O</b>n peut r&eacute;aliser un gain en capital de deux fa&ccedil;ons lorsqu'on investit dans

un fonds mutuel. D'abord, on peut r&eacute;aliser un gain en capital lorsqu'on vend &agrave;

profit les unit&eacute;s qu'on d&eacute;tient dans le portefeuille. Ce gain en capital vous est

vers&eacute; sous forme de distributions et est d&eacute;clar&eacute; sur un feuillet T3 ou un

relev&eacute; 16.



<p><b>L</b>a deuxi&egrave;me fa&ccedil;on de r&eacute;aliser un gain en capital est de

vendre ses unit&eacute;s de fonds mutuel. Comme la valeur des unit&eacute;s d'un fonds mutuel

fluctue avec le temps, il est possible de r&eacute;aliser un gain (une perte) en capital lorsqu'on se

d&eacute;partit de ses unit&eacute;s - soit par le biais d'un rachat ou d'un transfert entre fonds.

Les soci&eacute;t&eacute;s de fonds mutuels sont tenues de d&eacute;clarer &agrave; Revenu

Canada, sur le formulaire T5008, les rachats et transferts au titre de chaque compte. Elles ne sont

toutefois pas oblig&eacute;es de vous en envoyer une copie pour vos dossiers. Or, si elles

d&eacute;cident de le faire, vous n'avez pas &agrave; annexer le formulaire T5008 &agrave;

votre d&eacute;claration de revenus.



<p><b>I</b>l n'est pas n&eacute;cessaire de d&eacute;clarer les gains en capital provenant des

fonds d&eacute;tenus dans un REER, pas plus qu'on ne r&eacute;alise de gains en capital dans

les fonds o&ugrave; la valeur unitaire est constante (les fonds du march&eacute;

mon&eacute;taire, par exemple). Dans le cas de tous les autres fonds, il vous revient de calculer

les gains en capital et de d&eacute;clarer ce que vous r&eacute;alisez sur vos op&eacute;rations.



<p><b>&Eacute;</b>tant donn&eacute; que les gains en capital se calculent d'apr&egrave;s le

co&ucirc;t moyen de vos unit&eacute;s, vous devrez conna&icirc;tre le co&ucirc;t d'origine

(valeur comptable) des unit&eacute;s que vous avez achet&eacute;es. Voil&agrave; pourquoi il

importe de toujours garder vos relev&eacute;s de fonds mutuels.

<HR>

<H3>EXEMPLE DE CALCUL DU CO&Ucirc;T MOYEN</H3>

<B>D</B>ans cet exemple, on suppose un achat initial de 1 000 unit&eacute;s &agrave; 10 $

l'unit&eacute;, des distributions r&eacute;investies &agrave; une valeur unitaire de 12 $ et un

achat subs&eacute;quent &agrave; une valeur unitaire de 14 $. Toutes les unit&eacute;s sont

vendues ult&eacute;rieurement moyennant une valeur unitaire de 15 $.<br>



<p><center>

<IMG SRC="fr-tax1.gif">

</center><br>

                                

<p><b>N</b>'oubliez pas d'inclure les distributions r&eacute;investies dans le calcul du

co&ucirc;t moyen, sinon le co&ucirc;t sera trop faible.

<HR>

<H3>R&Eacute;GIMES ENREGISTR&Eacute;S D'&Eacute;PARGNE-RETRAITE</H3>

<b>A</b>ucune discussion concernant l'imp&ocirc;t ne saurait &ecirc;tre compl&egrave;te si

l'on ne mentionnait les r&eacute;gimes enregistr&eacute;s d'&eacute;pargne-retraite (REER). Il

s'agit de l'un des derniers abris fiscaux dont on peut se pr&eacute;valoir au Canada. Les

cotisations sont d&eacute;ductibles du revenu imposable et s'accumulent en franchise

d'imp&ocirc;t jusqu'&agrave; ce qu'on les retire.



<H4>Le point sur les REER</H4>

<UL><LI><B>V</B>otre plafond de cotisation en 1996 est &eacute;gal &agrave; 18 % du

revenu gagn&eacute; en 1995 jusqu'&agrave; un maximum de 13500 $, moins tout &lt;&lt;

facteur d'&eacute;quivalence &gt;&gt;, plus toute cotisation inutilis&eacute;e &agrave; partir de

1991. Pour conna&icirc;tre votre plafond de cotisation, reportez-vous &agrave; l'avis de

cotisation qui vous est envoy&eacute; chaque ann&eacute;e ou communiquez avec Revenu

Canada, en composant le num&eacute;ro que vous trouverez dans les pages bleues de l'annuaire

t&eacute;l&eacute;phonique.<br><br>



<LI><B>V</B>ous pouvez cotiser &agrave; un REER jusqu'&agrave; la fin de l'ann&eacute;e

de votre 71<font size=-1>e</font> anniversaire de naissance. &Agrave; partir de 1997, la limite

d'&acirc;ge sera

ramen&eacute;e &agrave; 69 ans.<br><br>

<LI><b>V</b>ous pouvez actuellement placer jusqu'&agrave; 20 % de la valeur comptable

(co&ucirc;t d'origine) de votre REER dans des titres &eacute;trangers admissibles.<br><br>

<LI><B>V</B>ous avez le droit de verser une cotisation exc&eacute;dentaire cumulative de 2

000 $ sans p&eacute;nalit&eacute;.<br><br>

<LI><B>L</B>es sommes retir&eacute;es d'un REER sont assujetties &agrave; des

imp&ocirc;ts pr&eacute;lev&eacute;s &agrave; la source, selon le bar&egrave;me suivant

:</UL>



<p><center> 

<IMG SRC="fr-tax2.gif">

</center><br>



<p><B>L</B>orsque votre REER &eacute;choit, trois options s'offrent &agrave; vous : retirer

votre REER d'un bloc, constituer une rente ou le transf&eacute;rer dans un fonds

enregistr&eacute; de revenu de retraite (FERR).

<CENTER><i><b>&lt;&lt; L'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t compos&eacute; est la plus grande

d&eacute;couverte math&eacute;matique de tous les temps. &gt;&gt;</b></i></center>



<P><center><b>C'est en ces termes qu'Albert Einstein aurait d&eacute;crit, dit-on, ce principe

d'investissement fondamental. Et m&ecirc;me si le principe de l'accumulation n'a pas connu le

m&ecirc;me retentissement que la c&eacute;l&egrave;bre th&eacute;orie de la relativit&eacute;,

les investisseurs qui en connaissent les rouages savent comment il favorise leur enrichissement et

ont donc d&eacute;j&agrave; franchi une &eacute;tape importante dans la r&eacute;alisation de

leurs objectifs financiers &agrave; long terme.</b></center>

<hr>



<h3>L'EFFET CUMULATIF, C'EST QUOI ? </h3>

<b>L</b>'effet cumulatif, c'est le ph&eacute;nom&egrave;ne qui r&eacute;sulte du

r&eacute;investissement syst&eacute;matique des gains r&eacute;alis&eacute;s par un

placement. Par exemple, dans le cas de titres &agrave; revenu fixe, les int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts

servent &agrave; acheter d'autres obligations. Dans le cas d'actions, les dividendes servent

&agrave; acheter des actions suppl&eacute;mentaires. S'il s'agit de fonds mutuels, l'on

r&eacute;investit alors les revenus, les dividendes ou encore les gains en capital r&eacute;partis

pour acheter des unit&eacute;s suppl&eacute;mentaires. Avec le temps, et &agrave; mesure que

vous continuez &agrave; r&eacute;investir vos profits dans vos placements, vous

<i>r&eacute;alisez</i> des gains sur vos gains, vous accumulez l'effet de la croissance de vos

placements.

<hr>

<h3>L'EXEMPLE CLASSIQUE</h3>

<b>S</b>upposons que vous placez 100 $ &agrave; un taux de 10 %. La premi&egrave;re

ann&eacute;e, votre placement rapportera 10 $, et vaudra alors 110 $. La deuxi&egrave;me

ann&eacute;e, ce 10 $ rapportera 1 $ <i>de plus...</i>  ce dollar suppl&eacute;mentaire est ce

qu'on appelle de l'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t compos&eacute;. Bien qu'il semble n&eacute;gligeable

au d&eacute;part, l'effet cumulatif, alli&eacute; &agrave; la puissance du passage du temps,

donne des r&eacute;sultats appr&eacute;ciables.

<hr>

<h3>LE TEMPS &Agrave; VOTRE SERVICE</h3>

<b>L</b>'effet cumulatif fait boule de neige! Apr&egrave;s un d&eacute;part modeste, le

ph&eacute;nom&egrave;ne gagne graduellement de la vitesse. Le graphique qui suit montre le

taux de croissance d'un placement initial de 10 000 $ dont le rendement est de 8 %,

compos&eacute; annuellement. La premi&egrave;re ann&eacute;e, le montant accumul&eacute;

n'est que 800 $. Par contre, la 10e ann&eacute;e, le placement rapporte des int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts

suppl&eacute;mentaires de 1 599 $. La 25e ann&eacute;e, il s'accro&icirc;t encore de 5 073 $. Et

voyez ce qu'il en est &agrave; la 30e ann&eacute;e : de 10 000 $ &agrave; l'origine, le placement

a d&eacute;cupl&eacute; et d&eacute;passe maintenant les 100 000 $.<br><br>



<center><h4>CROISSANCE D'UN PLACEMENT DE 10 000 $ INVESTI &Agrave; UN

TAUX DE 8 % COMPOS&Eacute; ANNUELLEMENT</center></h4>



<p><center><IMG

SRC="fr-comp1.gif">

</Center>

<br>

<P><b>M</b>ontant total accumul&eacute; apr&egrave;s 30 ans : 100 627 $. Si l'on soustrait le

montant initial investi (10 000 $) de cette somme, on a donc r&eacute;alis&eacute; des gains de

90 627 $.

<hr>

<h3>UNE COMPARAISON QUI DIT TOUT</h3>

<b>P</b>our bien saisir la puissance de l'effet cumulatif, voyons ce qui arrive au placement de

l'exemple pr&eacute;c&eacute;dent, mais sans l'effet b&eacute;n&eacute;fique de

l'accumulation. Ainsi, en investissant la m&ecirc;me somme, soit 10 000 $, au m&ecirc;me taux

de rendement annuel (8 %), et en encaissant tous les ans vos gains sur ce placement, sans

les r&eacute;investir, vous auriez obtenu une somme de 24 000 $ en revenus

d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t durant la m&ecirc;me p&eacute;riode de 30 ans. La valeur totale de votre

placement n'aurait &eacute;t&eacute; que de 34 000 $, soit 10 000 $ plus 24 000 $.

Comparons ce 34 000 $ &agrave; la somme de 100 627 $ : voil&agrave; le pouvoir de

l'accumulation.



<h4><center>COMPARAISON ENTRE L'INT&Eacute;R&Ecirc;T SIMPLE ET

L'INT&Eacute;R&Ecirc;T COMPOS&Eacute;</center></h4>



<center><IMG

SRC="fr-comp2.gif"></center>

<br><br>

<hr>

<h3>LA RECHERCHE DE TAUX DE RENDEMENT PLUS &Eacute;LEV&Eacute;S</h3>

<b>L</b>es &eacute;carts de taux de rendement influent aussi sur la croissance d'un placement.

Reprenons l'exemple ci-dessus et investissons maintenant la somme de 10 000 $ &agrave; divers

taux d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t compos&eacute;, pendant 20 ans. L'on voit que m&ecirc;me une

diff&eacute;rence apparemment n&eacute;gligeable dans les taux de rendement peut avoir des

cons&eacute;quences consid&eacute;rables &agrave; long terme. Une augmentation d'&agrave;

peine un pour cent, par exemple, de 8 % &agrave; 9 %, fait bondir la valeur de notre placement

initial (10 000 $) de 46 610 $ &agrave; 56 044 $ au bout de 20 ans.



<h4><center>VALEUR D'UN PLACEMENT DE 10 000 $ INVESTI &Agrave; DIVERS

TAUX DE RENDEMENT, APR&Egrave;S 20 ANS</center></h4>



<center>

<IMG SRC="fr-comp3.gif">

</center><br><br>

<P><b>M</b>alheureusement, dans la vraie vie, l'on ne peut pas obtenir le rendement

d&eacute;sir&eacute; sur nos placements simplement en le choisissant sur un tableau. La

recherche de placements &agrave; rendement plus &eacute;lev&eacute; implique

g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement l'acceptation d'un niveau de risque plus &eacute;lev&eacute;.

Malgr&eacute; tout, l'investisseur a int&eacute;r&ecirc;t &agrave; opter pour des titres &agrave;

fort potentiel de croissance, o&ugrave; la volatilit&eacute; &agrave; court terme des

diff&eacute;rents titres peut &ecirc;tre compens&eacute;e par une longue p&eacute;riode de

d&eacute;tention; il faut aussi tenir compte de son niveau de tol&eacute;rance au risque.

<hr>

<h3>TROIS R&Egrave;GLES &Agrave; RETENIR</h3>

<b>L</b>'effet cumulatif n'est pas un m&eacute;canisme instantan&eacute;. Il s'agit

plut&ocirc;t d'une fa&ccedil;on de s'enrichir lentement. Mais la puissance de l'accumulation sera

un pr&eacute;cieux atout pour atteindre vos objectifs financiers si vous suivez ces petits conseils

:

<ul><li><i>Tout en n'&eacute;cartant pas les placements &agrave; risque, recherchez ceux dont

le potentiel est relativement &eacute;lev&eacute; &agrave; long terme.</i><br><br>

<li><i>Maintenez le cap.</i> Certains programmes d'investissement visent &agrave; procurer un

revenu d'appoint, un filet de s&eacute;curit&eacute; pour parer aux impond&eacute;rables. Par

contre, si votre but est plut&ocirc;t d'&eacute;pargner pour l'avenir, pour la retraite ou pour

d&eacute;frayer les &eacute;tudes coll&eacute;giales de vos jeunes enfants, par exemple,

<p><center><i><b>S'il y a plusieurs fa&ccedil;ons d'&eacute;valuer ce que rapporte un

placement, le rendement et le taux de rendement figurent parmi les plus utiles.  Dans toute

d&eacute;cision &agrave; prendre en mati&egrave;re de produits financiers, il importe d'utiliser

la bonne mesure.</b></I></center>

<hr>

<h3>RENDEMENT</h3>

<b>P</b>our d&eacute;crire le produit d'un placement, on utilise les termes 

&lt;&lt;rendement&gt;&gt; et &lt;&lt; taux de rendement &gt;&gt;. Entre les deux, le premier a

un sens un peu plus limit&eacute;; il sert g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement &agrave; mesurer les

b&eacute;n&eacute;fices d&eacute;coulant d'un capital investi. En termes plus simples, le

rendement mesure le niveau de revenu futur d'un placement par rapport &agrave; son prix. On dit

d'une obligation de 100 $ qui rapporte 5 $ par ann&eacute;e d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t qu'elle a un

rendement de 5 %. Une action au prix moyen de 25 $ qui rapporte 1 $ par ann&eacute;e de

dividende donne un rendement de 4 %.

<hr>

<h3>TAUX DE RENDEMENT</h3>

<b>L</b>e taux de rendement - parfois d&eacute;sign&eacute; comme rendement

total - correspond &agrave; une vue d'ensemble plus large du placement. Cette

donn&eacute;e mesure le rendement annuel d'un placement y compris

l'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t ou les dividendes en plus de l'appr&eacute;ciation de

capital. Supposons que vous payez 100 $ une obligation qui rapporte 5 $ par

ann&eacute;e d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t, puis que vous la vendez 110 $ un an plus

tard. Le rendement de l'obligation a &eacute;t&eacute; de 5 $, mais le taux de

rendement a &eacute;t&eacute; de 15 %, &eacute;tant donn&eacute; que votre

placement initial a rapport&eacute; 15 $ (5 $ d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t plus 10 $ de

gain de capital) en fin d'ann&eacute;e.

<hr>

<h3>COMMENT FAIRE LA DISTINCTION</h3>

<b>L</b>e rendement est essentiellement une statistique de prospection; il vous

donne une id&eacute;e de l'allure de l'&eacute;volution du placement si les

conditions actuelles demeurent les m&ecirc;mes. Le taux de rendement porte sur le

pass&eacute; : il mesure le rendement r&eacute;el d'un placement,

c'est-&agrave;-dire le montant que vous aviez au d&eacute;but et ce dont vous

disposez aujourd'hui. Les fournisseurs de produits financiers doivent employer ces

termes avec prudence pour d&eacute;crire la performance des placements qu'ils

offrent au public.

<hr>

<h3>LES CPG</h3>

<b>L</b>es certificats de placement garanti (CPG) mentionnent habituellement un taux

d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t fixe plut&ocirc;t qu'un rendement. M&ecirc;me si les investisseurs ont

tendance &agrave; choisir ces produits pour leur rendement pr&eacute;vu, le taux

d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t, le prix et la date d'&eacute;ch&eacute;ance d'un CPG sont tous, dans la

plupart des cas, fixes. Il n'y aura donc aucune surprise &agrave; l'avenir; un CPG garantit un taux

d&eacute;termin&eacute; d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t sur le capital investi pour toute la dur&eacute;e

du placement.

<hr>

<h3>FONDS DU MARCH&Eacute; MON&Eacute;TAIRE</h3>

<b>L</b>es fonds du march&eacute; mon&eacute;taire publient toujours le

rendement et le taux de rendement quand ils font &eacute;tat de leurs

performances au public. (En vertu de la Loi, ces fonds ne peuvent annoncer un

taux de rendement sans &eacute;galement mentionner le rendement.) Le taux de

rendement, soit la mesure en r&eacute;trospective, d&eacute;crit la performance

pass&eacute;e d'un fonds du march&eacute; mon&eacute;taire. Quant au

rendement, les organismes de r&eacute;glementation des valeurs

mobili&egrave;res canadiennes en reconnaissent deux types : le rendement

courant et le rendement r&eacute;el. Le rendement courant est un

instantan&eacute; de la situation actuelle, montrant le revenu moyen de tous les

titres formant le portefeuille au cours des sept derniers jours converti &agrave; un

taux annuel. Quant au rendement r&eacute;el - &eacute;valuation de ce que peut

vous rapporter r&eacute;ellement un placement dans un fonds du march&eacute;

mon&eacute;taire - il montre le rendement actuel et reconna&icirc;t l'avantage

additionnel de l'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t compos&eacute; hebdomadaire.

<hr>

<h3>FONDS MUTUELS D'ACTIONS ET D'OBLIGATIONS</h3>

<b>L</b>e taux de rendement est la seule statistique de performance

mandat&eacute;e &agrave; utiliser pour mesurer les fonds mutuels d'actions et

d'obligations. En d'autres termes, il est relativement facile de voir le chemin

parcouru de ces fonds, mais il est beaucoup plus difficile d'en projeter leur

destination. Contrairement aux CPG ou aux fonds du march&eacute;

mon&eacute;taire, les prix des fonds d'actions et d'obligations montent et baissent

chaque jour, de sorte qu'il est difficile d'anticiper d'une fa&ccedil;on le

moindrement pr&eacute;cise les rendements futurs.

<hr>

<h3>LES MESURES D'&Eacute;VALUATION</h3>

<b>P</b>our comparer divers CPG, il n'est pas n&eacute;cessaire d'aller

au-del&agrave; de leurs taux d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t annonc&eacute;s - dans le

choix du taux et de la dur&eacute;e qui vous attirent le plus. Mais lorsqu'on

compare un fonds du march&eacute; mon&eacute;taire avec un autre, il faut tenir

compte du taux de rendement et du rendement r&eacute;trospectifs des deux pour

obtenir le meilleur portrait de constance globale. Quant aux fonds mutuels

d'actions et d'obligations, le taux de rendement est un moyen d'&eacute;valuation

utile, mais limit&eacute;. La performance historique d'un fonds peut vous donner

une id&eacute;e des progr&egrave;s r&eacute;alis&eacute;s par

le fonds, mais elle reste muette sur la volatilit&eacute; qu'il a connue en cours de

route ou comment il se comportera &agrave; l'avenir. Si vous n'&eacute;valuez pas les fonds

d'apr&egrave;s le taux de rendement, assurez-vous qu'on compare bien des

pommes avec des pommes, c'est-&agrave;-dire qu'on ne compare que des fonds du

m&ecirc;me type (&eacute;quilibr&eacute;s, internationaux, obligations

d'&Eacute;tat, etc.)

<hr>

<h3>QUEL INVESTISSEMENT ME CONVIENT PARTICULI&Egrave;REMENT?</h3>

<b>M</b>&ecirc;me si vous saisissez la diff&eacute;rence entre le rendement et le

taux de rendement, vous devrez encore &eacute;valuer vos objectifs personnels et

votre degr&eacute; de tol&eacute;rance au risque afin de faire des choix

appropri&eacute;s en mati&egrave;re de placements. Mais que vous recherchiez

une croissance maximale ou une s&eacute;curit&eacute; relative, vous auriez sans

doute int&eacute;r&ecirc;t &agrave; ne pas vous limiter &agrave; un seul type de

placement. Un portefeuille diversifi&eacute; compos&eacute; d'actions,

d'obligations et d'instruments &agrave; court terme, est

g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement moins volatile qu'un placement constitu&eacute;

d'un seul type d'actif.



<p><b>V</b>oil&agrave; pourquoi la Banque TD a con&ccedil;u le

mod&egrave;le de r&eacute;partition d'actif. Ce programme simple en trois points

peut vous aider &agrave; cr&eacute;er un portefeuille strat&eacute;giquement

<center><h4><i>Plus que jamais, les march&eacute;s boursiers internationaux sont fort

prometteurs. L'expansion rapide de jeunes entreprises dans des march&eacute;s

&eacute;mergents et le d&eacute;veloppement de nouveaux cr&eacute;neaux par de

<h3>POURQUOI INVESTIR AILLEURS DANS LE MONDE?</h3>



<P><b>Un plus grand &eacute;ventail de placements</b>

<p><b>L</b>e march&eacute; boursier canadien, sixi&egrave;me en importance au monde, est

certes bas&eacute; sur une &eacute;conomie d&eacute;velopp&eacute;e et diversifi&eacute;e

offrant une vaste gamme de placements. Or, le Canada ne repr&eacute;sente que 3 % de la

capitalisation boursi&egrave;re mondiale. Autrement dit, 97 % des occasions de placement se

trouvent &agrave; l'&eacute;tranger. 



<P><b>Des perspectives de croissance sup&eacute;rieures</b>

<p><b>E</b>n termes historiques, nombre de march&eacute;s boursiers et obligataires

&eacute;trangers ont surpass&eacute; les march&eacute;s canadiens. Pendant la p&eacute;riode

de 12 ans termin&eacute;e le 31 d&eacute;cembre 1995, le rendement annuel moyen du

march&eacute; boursier dans de nombreux pays a &eacute;t&eacute; de loin sup&eacute;rieur

&agrave; celui de la bourse canadienne.

<P><center><font size=-2>Les chiffres correspondent au rendement total et sont

exprim&eacute;s en dollars canadiens. Les pays mentionn&eacute;s repr&eacute;sentent les dix

plus importants march&eacute;s mondiaux en  termes de capitalisation boursi&egrave;re.<br>

Source : Morgan Stanley Capital International</font></center>



<P><b>Une diversification accrue</b>

<p><b>E</b>n investissant &agrave; l'&eacute;chelle mondiale, vous &ecirc;tes en mesure de

diversifier vos placements parmi les &eacute;conomies et les march&eacute;s, affichant

diff&eacute;rents rythmes de croissance, depuis les pays industrialis&eacute;s

d'Am&eacute;rique du Nord, d'Europe et du Japon aux pays en essor rapide tels ceux de l'Asie du

Sud-Est et de l'Am&eacute;rique latine. De plus, les march&eacute;s internationaux vous

permettent de prendre part &agrave; des secteurs &agrave; forte croissance peut-&ecirc;tre

inexistants au Canada. Ainsi, la plupart des chefs de file dans le domaine des soins de

sant&eacute; et de la science et technologie sont &eacute;tablis aux &Eacute;tats-Unis et en

Europe. 



<P><b>Un risque moindre</b>

<p><b>&Eacute;</b>tant donn&eacute; que les &eacute;conomies, les march&eacute;s et les

monnaies ne suivent pas tous le m&ecirc;me cycle, vous avez tout int&eacute;r&ecirc;t &agrave;

diversifier vos placements afin de diminuer l'impact que la pi&egrave;tre tenue d'un

march&eacute; ou d'une monnaie pourrait avoir sur le portefeuille. Vous pouvez r&eacute;duire

la volatilit&eacute; de votre portefeuille en optant pour la diversification g&eacute;ographique.



<p><center>LA COMPOSITION ID&Eacute;ALE <BR>

<font size=-1>74/12/31 -- 95/12/31</font></center><br>



<P><center>

<IMG SRC="fr-glob2.gif">

</center>



<p><center><font size=-2>Titres canadiens : TSE 300; Titres &eacute;trangers : indice EAEO

de Morgan Stanley



<P>Au cours des 21 derni&egrave;res ann&eacute;es, le rendement le plus &eacute;lev&eacute;,

compte tenu des risques, a &eacute;t&eacute obtenu par un portefeuille d'actions

compos&eacute; de titres canadiens et &eacute;trangers dans une proportion de 70/30. Chacun

pourra d&eacute;terminer la composition qui lui convient en fonction de sa situation

personnelle.</font> </center>

<HR>

<h3>QUELS SONT LES RISQUES?</H3>

<B>Monnaies</b>

<p><b>L</b>orsque vous achetez des titres &eacute;trangers, vos dollars sont convertis dans la

monnaie du pays en question.  Lorsque vous les vendez, c'est l'inverse qui se  produit. Par

cons&eacute;quent, les variations des taux de change auront une incidence sur la valeur de vos

titres &eacute;trangers.



<p><b>A</b>insi, lorsque le dollar canadien s'appr&eacute;cie par rapport &agrave; une autre

monnaie, vos titres &eacute;trangers valent alors moins en dollars canadiens, et la valeur de vos

placements s'en trouve diminu&eacute;e d'autant.  Par contre, lorsque le dollar canadien se

d&eacute;pr&eacute;cie la valeur de vos titres &eacute;trangers  augmente.  La fluctuation

incessante des taux de change peut donc accro&icirc;tre de fa&ccedil;on importante la

volatilit&eacute; &agrave; court et &agrave; long terme d'un portefeuille de titres

&eacute;trangers.

</center>



<P><center>

<IMG SRC="fr-glob3.gif">

</center>



<P><b>Facteurs politiques et &eacute;conomiques</b>

<p><b>E</b>n plus d'&ecirc;tre touch&eacute;s par les changements cycliques survenant au

sein des diverses &eacute;conomies locales ou r&eacute;gionales, les cours boursiers

internationaux d&eacute;pendent aussi des facteurs politiques, &eacute;conomiques et sociaux. 

Des &eacute;v&eacute;nements majeurs, tels que la d&eacute;valuation du peso mexicain en

d&eacute;cembre 1994 et le tremblement de terre de Kobe au Japon en janvier 1995, peuvent

certes influer sur les march&eacute;s boursiers de nombreuses r&eacute;gions et de nombreux

pays.  De m&ecirc;me, des &eacute;v&eacute;nements porteurs de changements socio-politiques

&agrave; l'&eacute;chelle d'une r&eacute;gion particuli&egrave;re peuvent miner

consid&eacute;rablement la valeur des placements effectu&eacute;s dans des pays en

d&eacute;veloppment.

<P>

<b>Renseignements sur les soci&eacute;t&eacute;s &eacute;trang&egrave;rs</b>

<p><b>L</b>es soci&eacute;t&eacute;s &eacute;trang&egrave;rs ne sont pas

n&eacute;cessairement soumises &agrave; la m&ecirc;me r&eacute;glementation

s&eacute;v&egrave;re ni aux m&ecirc;mes normes comptables que les soci&eacute;t&eacute;s

canadiennes.  En cons&eacute;quence, il est difficile d'analyser avec exactitude les

b&eacute;n&eacute;fices, les revenus, la valeur comptable et les autres crit&egrave;res de

placement.

<hr>

<h3>QUELLES SONT LES OPTIONS?</H3>

<B>L</b>es fonds mutuels b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiant d'une gestion professionnelle et d'une

vaste diversification, constituent un excellent placement pour ceux qui veulent mater les risques

et profiter des avantages des placements &agrave; l'&eacute;tranger.  Tout comme les fonds

canadiens, il existe des fonds d'actions internationales et des fonds &agrave; revenu fixe qui

conviennent aux objectifs de placement et &agrave; la tol&eacute;rance au risque de chacun.



<P><b>Fonds largement diversifi&eacute;s</b>

<p><b>L</b>es fonds mondiaux investissent dans n'importe quel pays du monde, tandis que les

fonds internationaux investissent partout, &agrave; l'exception du Canada et des

&Eacute;tats-Unis.  En r&egrave;gle g&eacute;n&eacute;rale, l'actif de ces fonds est

r&eacute;parti entre plusieurs r&eacute;gions, pays et soci&eacute;t&eacute;s des quatre coins

du globe et leur volatilit&eacute; est particuli&egrave;rement faible.  De plus, les gestionnaires

de portefeuille rectifient la r&eacute;partition de placements entre les divers pays au fur et

&agrave; mesure que l'&eacute;conomie et les march&eacute;s &eacute;voluent.



<p><b>Fonds r&eacute;gionaux et fonds nationaux</b>

<p><b>L</b>es fonds r&eacute;gionaux investissent dans une r&eacute;gion sp&eacute;cifique

comme l'Europe, l'Asie du Sud-Est ou l'Am&eacute;rique du Nord. Les fonds nationaux se

limitent &agrave; un seul pays, le Japon par exemple.



<P><b>P</b>uisque ces deux types de fonds offrent une diversification mod&eacute;r&eacute;e

des placements, donc un niveau de risque plus &eacute;lev&eacute;, ils peuvent d&eacute;gager

un rendement annuel relativement &eacute;lev&eacute;. Les fonds plus dynamiques, tels les

fonds des march&eacute;s &eacute;mergents qui investissent dans des pays en voie

d'industrialisation rapide comme l'Asie du Sud-Est ou l'Am&eacute;rique latine, ont tendance

&agrave; &ecirc;tre tr&egrave;s volatils, mais ils ont un potentiel de rendement de loin

sup&eacute;rieur &agrave; la moyenne.

<hr>

<h3>PARTIR DU BON PIED</H3> 

<B>A</b>vant de d&eacute;cider quelle proportion de votre portefeuille vous devriez investir

&agrave; l'&eacute;chelle mondiale, prenez le temps de bien r&eacute;fl&eacute;chir &agrave;

vos objectifs financiers, &agrave; votre horizon de placement et &agrave; votre niveau de

tol&eacute;rance au risque.  Revenu Canada permet aux titulaires d'un REER de placer

jusqu'&agrave; 20% de la valeur comptable (co&ucirc;t d'origine) de chacun de leurs

r&eacute;gimes dans des valeurs &eacute;trang&egrave;res.

s'agit d'un indice tr&egrave;s vaste, le gestionnaire se limite &agrave; un &eacute;chantillon

repr&eacute;sentatif des titres compris dans l'indice. La gestion indicielle ne cherche aucunement

&agrave; surpasser l'indice au moyen des techniques traditionnelles dites &lt;&lt; actives

&gt;&gt; qui misent sur des titres ou des secteurs d'activit&eacute; pr&eacute;cis.



<p><b>L</b>a gestion indicielle repose sur l'hypoth&egrave;se que les march&eacute;s

financiers sont efficients &agrave; long terme, de sorte qu'il est &agrave; peu pr&egrave;s

impossible de surpasser constamment les indices boursiers en pratiquant une gestion active. C'est

d'ailleurs pour cette raison que la gestion indicielle conna&icirc;t depuis longtemps une si grande

popularit&eacute; aupr&egrave;s des gestionnaires de caisses de retraite d'entreprises, car ces

derniers privil&eacute;gient une strat&eacute;gie de placement conservatrice et peu

risqu&eacute;e afin de r&eacute;aliser des rendements constants.



<p><b>D</b>ans ses efforts pour calquer aussi fid&egrave;lement que possible le rendement

d'un indice

donn&eacute;, le gestionnaire de portefeuilles fait largement appel &agrave; l'informatique.

&Agrave;

l'aide de strat&eacute;gies et de logiciels de n&eacute;gociation des plus perfectionn&eacute;s,

le

gestionnaire est en mesure de r&eacute;viser le portefeuille pour tenir compte des changements

apport&eacute;s &agrave; la composition de l'indice de r&eacute;f&eacute;rence et pour

g&eacute;rer les

liquidit&eacute;s du fonds.

<h3>DIVERSIFICATION </h3>

<b>P</b>ar d&eacute;finition, l'indice est la repr&eacute;sentation la plus fid&egrave;le

possible de l'&eacute;tat d'une &eacute;conomie ou d'un march&eacute;. Il existe des indices

pour toutes les principales cat&eacute;gories d'actif - bons du Tr&eacute;sor, obligations et

actions - tant sur les march&eacute;s nationaux qu'&eacute;trangers. Par exemple, l'indice

compos&eacute TSE 300, l'indice boursier le plus couramment utilis&eacute; au Canada, brosse

le plus vaste tableau possible des entreprises canadiennes. Le fait de r&eacute;partir les

placements entre les cat&eacute;gories d'actif et les r&eacute;gions g&eacute;ographiques

permet de d&eacute;gager, &agrave; long terme, un rendement fiable puisqu'il att&eacute;nue

les hauts et les bas du march&eacute;.

<hr>

<h3>MODICIT&Eacute; DES CO&Ucirc;TS</h3>

<b>L</b>es frais de gestion exig&eacute;s pour les fonds index&eacute;s sont de beaucoup

inf&eacute;rieurs &agrave; ceux des fonds qui b&eacute;n&eacute;ficient d'une gestion active.

Ils sont

r&eacute;duits du fait que la s&eacute;lection de titres s'appuie sur une analyse par ordinateur, ce

qui

&eacute;vite les services de recherche on&eacute;reux. De plus, les frais de transaction sont

g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement moindres parce que le portefeuille des fonds index&eacute;s est

plus stable.

<hr>

<h3>RENDEMENT</h3>

<b>C</b>omme on peut s'y attendre, sur une longue p&eacute;riode, les fonds index&eacute;s

se classent pr&egrave;s de la moyenne par rapport aux fonds comparables. La gestion indicielle

exigeant des frais inf&eacute;rieurs, on note une augmentation du rendement relatif

apr&egrave;s d&eacute;duction des frais en question. 



<P><b>L</b>es fonds index&eacute;s parviennent rarement &agrave; &eacute;galer l'indice de

r&eacute;f&eacute;rence. M&ecirc;me si elles sont modestes, les d&eacute;penses

associ&eacute;es &agrave; ces fonds auront une incidence sur le rendement. L'&eacute;cart peut

&eacute;galement &ecirc;tre attribuable &agrave; la technique employ&eacute;e pour suivre

l'&eacute;volution de l'indice.



<p><b>L</b>orsque les march&eacute;s reculent, les fonds index&eacute;s ont tendance

&agrave; &ecirc;tre devanc&eacute;s par les fonds &agrave; gestion active. C'est toutefois

l'inverse qui se produit en cas de reprise. &Eacute;tant donn&eacute; que les fonds

index&eacute;s sont enti&egrave;rement investis, le gestionnaire ne peut pas compter

sur les liquidit&eacute;s comme mesure d&eacute;fensive. Contrairement au gestionnaire actif,

le gestionnaire de fonds index&eacute;s ne peut pas vendre des actions pour augmenter les

liquidit&eacute;s lorsque le march&eacute; se replie. Par contre, les fonds index&eacute;s ne

ratent jamais un redressement du march&eacute; parce que le gestionnaire adopte une attitude

passive. 

<hr>



<h3>LES FONDS INDEX&Eacute;S ET VOTRE PORTEFEUILLE</h3>

<b>L</b>es fonds index&eacute;s constituent un moyen &eacute;conomique de prendre part

&agrave; un portefeuille largement diversifi&eacute; et offrent un rendement constant &agrave;

long terme. Ils offrent une excellente protection contre la volatilit&eacute; inh&eacute;rente aux

fonds g&eacute;r&eacute;s activement et ils &eacute;voluent de fa&ccedil;on plut&ocirc;t

pr&eacute;visible lorsque la conjoncture &eacute;conomique est incertaine. Avec les fonds

index&eacute;s, vous savez toujours comment se portent vos placements : vous ouvrez le journal

et si le march&eacute; monte, vous savez que votre fonds est lui aussi &agrave; la hausse.

<hr>



<h3>PASSEZ &Agrave; L'ACTION</h3>

<b>L</b>a gamme de fonds mutuels Ligne Verte vous propose trois fonds index&eacute;s :

Fonds canadien index&eacute; Ligne Verte, Fonds am&eacute;ricain index&eacute; Ligne Verte

et Fonds d'obligations du gouvernement du Canada Ligne Verte. Le Fonds canadien

index&eacute; fait appel &agrave; la reproduction pour calquer l'indice du rendement

total TSE 300, le Fonds am&eacute;ricain index&eacute; recourt &agrave; l'optimisation pour

refl&eacute;ter l'indice du rendement total S&P 500, tandis que le Fonds d'obligations du

gouvernement du Canada utilise l'&eacute;chantillonnage afin de suivre l'indice des obligations

d'&Eacute;tat ScotiaMcLeod. Pour obtenir de plus amples renseignements sur les fonds

index&eacute;s Ligne Verte, rendez-vous &agrave; votre succursale TD, communiquez avec

<h4><i><center>Les fonds mutuels permettent &agrave; l'investisseur moyen d'avoir

acc&egrave;s &agrave; des placements qui ne sont offerts, en temps normal, qu'aux grandes

institutions ou aux grosses fortunes. Cependant, avant d'y placer son argent, il est sage de bien

comprendre les principes fondamentaux des fonds mutuels. </center></i></h4>

<HR>

<h3>QU'EST-CE QU'UN FONDS MUTUEL?</h3>

<b>U</b>n fonds mutuel est un placement qui met en commun les &eacute;conomies d'un

grand nombre de personnes pour les investir en fonction d'objectifs pr&eacute;cis. Le

gestionnaire professionnel prend des d&eacute;cisions de placement au nom des investisseurs

: il ach&egrave;te et vend des actions, obligations et titres du march&eacute; mon&eacute;taire.



<P><b>L</b>orsque vous achetez des unit&eacute;s d'un fonds mutuel, vous devenez en

partie propri&eacute;taire des titres d&eacute;tenus par ce fonds. La valeur unitaire est

calcul&eacute;e &agrave; la fin de chaque jour ouvrable : elle est &eacute;gale &agrave; la

valeur marchande, &agrave; la cl&ocirc;ture, de tous les titres du portefeuille; on soustrait

ensuite tous les &eacute;l&eacute;ments de passif et on divise ce chiffre par le nombre total

d'unit&eacute;s en circulation. Ainsi donc, la valeur unitaire fluctue tous les jours en fonction des

changements qui surviennent dans la valeur des titres individuels et du nombre d'unit&eacute;s

en circulation.



<P><b>T</b>out revenu r&eacute;alis&eacute; par le fonds - int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts, dividendes,

gains en capital - est transmis aux investisseurs en proportion du nombre d'unit&eacute;s qu'ils

d&eacute;tiennent. Autrement dit, les investisseurs qui ne sont propri&eacute;taires que de

quelques unit&eacute;s obtiennent le m&ecirc;me rendement au dollar que ceux qui en

poss&egrave;dent des milliers.

<hr>

<h3>POURQUOI ACH&Egrave;TE-T-ON DES FONDS MUTUELS?</h3>

<b>Gestion professionnelle</b>

<p><b>P</b>eu de gens disposent du temps ou des

ressources n&eacute;cessaires pour se tenir au courant de l'actualit&eacute; financi&egrave;re et

pour &eacute;valuer les actions et obligations qu'ils d&eacute;tiennent. Avec un fonds mutuel,

vous avez acc&egrave;s &agrave;

des gestionnaires de profession qui consacrent tout leur temps &agrave; surveiller les

march&eacute;s,

&agrave; analyser les titres et &agrave; mettre en oeuvre des strat&eacute;gies de placement.



<p><b>Diversification</b>

<p><b>U</b>n principe de base du placement consiste &agrave; diversifier votre portefeuille.

Ce faisant, vous diminuez les risques de l'impact qu'un tr&egrave;s mauvais choix pourrait avoir

sur le portefeuille. En r&egrave;gle g&eacute;n&eacute;rale, un fonds mutuel d&eacute;tient de

50 &agrave; 100 titres diff&eacute;rents. L'investisseur moyen aurait beaucoup de mal &agrave;

constituer un portefeuille de cette taille, sans compter que cela lui co&ucirc;terait cher.



<p><b>Placement abordable</b>

<p><b>V</b>ous pouvez placer dans un fonds mutuel aussi peu que 25 $ par mois si vous

participez &agrave; un plan d'achat pr&eacute;autoris&eacute;.  Investir de petites sommes

&agrave; intervalles r&eacute;guliers (&agrave; le semaine, au mois, au trimestre) n'est pas

seulement &agrave; la port&eacute;e de tout le monde, c'est &eacute;galement un bon moyen de

profiter pleinement du jeu de l'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t compos&eacute;.



<P><b>Liquidit&eacute;</b>

<p><b>V</b>ous avez acc&egrave;s &agrave; la totalit&eacute; ou &agrave; une partie de

votre argent aussit&ocirc;t que vous en avez besoin. Vous pouvez acheter ou vendre des

unit&eacute;s n'importe quel jour ouvrable. Bien entendu, lorsque vous vendez vos

unit&eacute;s, leur prix d&eacute;pend de leur valeur marchande courante, qui peut &ecirc;tre

sup&eacute;rieure ou inf&eacute;rieure au prix o&ugrave; vous les avez achet&eacute;es.



<p><b>Commodit&eacute;</b>

<p><b>I</b>l est facile de suivre votre argent &agrave; la trace. Vous pouvez consulter tous les

jours un journal pour conna&icirc;tre le prix de cl&ocirc;ture des fonds que vous

poss&eacute;dez et vous recevez r&eacute;guli&egrave;rement de pr&eacute;cieux

renseignements sur vos placements. L'information se pr&eacute;sente sous forme de

relev&eacute;s financiers d&eacute;taill&eacute;s et de rapports trimestriels sur les

changements intervenus dans la composition des titres et sur d'autres donn&eacute;es de

placement.



<p><b>L</b>a plupart des soci&eacute;t&eacute;s mettent &agrave; la disposition de leurs

clients une ligne t&eacute;l&eacute;phonique sans frais gr&acirc;ce &agrave; laquelle ceux-ci

obtiennent des renseignements sur leur compte, sur le prix des fonds, sur les rendements et sur

l'&eacute;tat des march&eacute;s. Certaines soci&eacute;t&eacute;s vous permettent

m&ecirc;me d'acheter, de vendre et de transf&eacute;rer des unit&eacute;s par

t&eacute;l&eacute;phone. La plupart des soci&eacute;t&eacute;s de fonds mutuels vous

facilitent encore plus la t&acirc;che en offrant un programme automatique de

pr&eacute;l&egrave;vements ou de retraits bancaires.



<p><b>Souplesse</b>

<p><b>S</b>i votre fonds fait partie d'une &lt;&lt; famille &gt;&gt; de fonds, vous avez la

possibilit&eacute; de transf&eacute;rer une partie ou la totalit&eacute; de vos sommes d'un

fonds &agrave; l'autre &agrave; mesure que vos besoins changent ou que de nouvelles occasions

se pr&eacute;sentent.



<p><b>Admissibilit&eacute; au REER</b>

<p><b>L</b>es fonds mutuels sont un excellent moyen de tirer parti des placements

effectu&eacute;s en franchise d'imp&ocirc;t. Beaucoup de fonds canadiens sont admissibles

&agrave; 100 % au REER; la plupart des fonds internationaux sont admissibles au plafond des

20 % de contenu &eacute;tranger. Les fonds mutuels constituent &eacute;galement un outil

id&eacute;al de planification financi&egrave;re. &Agrave;  mesure que vous approchez de la

retraite et que la stabilit&eacute; de votre portefeuille prend de l'importance, vous pouvez

d&eacute;placer graduellement votre capital vers des fonds privil&eacute;giant la prudence.

<hr>

<h3>TYPES DE FONDS</h3>

<b>Q</b>uelles que soient vos raisons d'investir, il y a fort &agrave; parier qu'un fonds mutuel

ou une combinaison de fonds mutuels comblera vos besoins. Certains fonds visent la

s&eacute;curit&eacute;; d'autres, un revenu &eacute;lev&eacute;; d'autres encore, la croissance

&agrave; long terme. L'investisseur peut choisir parmi des fonds qui investissent dans des

actions ou dans des obligations, dans des titres canadiens ou &eacute;trangers, dans des

soci&eacute;t&eacute;s de premier ordre ou dans des entreprises &agrave; petite capitalisation.

M&ecirc;me si le choix est vaste, tous les fonds mutuels tomberont dans l'une ou l'autre des

quatre cat&eacute;gories suivantes.



<p><b>Les fonds du march&eacute; mon&eacute;taire</b> offrent le maximum de

s&eacute;curit&eacute;, mais un rendement relativement faible. Ils investissent

g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement dans des titres &agrave; court terme de grande qualit&eacute;,

comme des bons du Tr&eacute;sor, des acceptations bancaires et du papier commercial.

Contrairement aux autres types de fonds, les fonds du march&eacute; mon&eacute;taire sont

g&eacute;r&eacute;s de mani&egrave;re que leur valeur unitaire reste fixe. Voil&agrave;

pourquoi ces fonds sont de bons v&eacute;hicules de placement lorsque vous avez besoin de

votre argent dans un avenir relativement rapproch&eacute;.



<p><b>Les fonds de revenu</b> rapportent un revenu d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts r&eacute;gulier

en investissant dans des titres &agrave; revenu fixe comme des obligations d'&Eacute;tat ou de

soci&eacute;t&eacute;s, des hypoth&egrave;ques et des titres hypoth&eacute;caires. En

r&egrave;gle g&eacute;n&eacute;rale, les fonds de revenu

ont de meilleures perspectives de rendement que les fonds du march&eacute; mon&eacute;taire,

mais leur valeur fluctue &agrave; l'inverse de la direction prise par les taux

d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t. Les fonds de revenu constituent un bon choix pour les investisseurs qui

recherchent un revenu r&eacute;gulier et une certaine plus-value de leur capital.



<p><b>Les fonds de croissance</b> offrent les meilleures perspectives de rendement

parce qu'ils investissent surtout dans les actions ordinaires. M&ecirc;me si les actions

ordinaires sont, historiquement, plus volatiles &agrave; court terme que les autres

cat&eacute;gories d'actif, elles fournissent un rendement sup&eacute;rieur &agrave; long terme

et une meilleure protection contre l'inflation.<br><br>



<center>

<IMG SRC="fr-mut1.gif">

</center><br><br>



<p><B>L</B>es fonds de croissance peuvent jouer un r&ocirc;le important pour aider les

investisseurs &agrave; devenir financi&egrave;rement plus &agrave; l'aise avec le temps.

Certains fonds de croissance sont largement diversifi&eacute;s par r&eacute;gions ou par

industries, tandis que d'autres privil&eacute;gient un pays ou une industrie. Certains fonds de

croissance s'alignent carr&eacute;ment sur des indices bien connus, comme l'indice du

rendement total du TSE 300.



<p><b>Les fonds hybrides </b>- appel&eacute;s aussi fonds &eacute;quilibr&eacute;s -

investissent dans une combinaison strat&eacute;gique d'actions, d'obligations et de titres du

march&eacute; mon&eacute;taire. Les gestionnaires modifient souvent la r&eacute;partition de

l'actif suivant l'&eacute;volution des march&eacute;s et de la conjoncture. Ces fonds attirent les

investisseurs qui pr&eacute;f&egrave;rent &lt;&lt; un guichet unique &gt;&gt; lorsqu'ils placent

leur argent dans les fonds mutuels.

<hr>

<h3>&Eacute;VALUER UN FONDS</h3>

<b>Fiche de rendement.</b> M&ecirc;me les fonds les mieux g&eacute;r&eacute;s comportent

des risques &agrave; court terme, c'est-&agrave;-dire qu'ils peuvent fluctuer

consid&eacute;rablement d'un mois &agrave; l'autre, d'une ann&eacute;e &agrave; l'autre. Pour

avoir une meilleure id&eacute;e d'un fonds, il vaut mieux regarder sa fiche de rendement

&agrave; long terme en reculant d'au moins trois ans et, de pr&eacute;f&eacute;rence, cinq ans.



<p><b>N</b>'oubliez pas de comparer le fonds aux atures fonds de sa cat&eacute;gorie.  Un

indice de la bonne qualit&eacute; d'un fonds est son aptitude &agrave; d&eacute;passer le

rendement des fonds de sa cat&eacute;gorie en p&eacute;riode de vaches grasses et en

p&eacute;riode de vaches maigres. Rappelez-vous que m&ecirc;me si le rendement est un outil

important pour comparer les fonds et pour les

&eacute;valuer, il ne vise que le pass&eacute;. Il n'est pas possible de pr&eacute;voir ni de

garantir le rendement futur d'un fonds, quels qu'aient &eacute;t&eacute; les r&eacute;sultats

obtenus dans le pass&eacute;. 



<P><b>Prospectus</b>

<p><b>O</b>n trouve dans le prospectus tout ce qu'il faut savoir sur un fonds mutuel : le

gestionnaire, les frais, l'objectif de placement et d'autres renseignements importants. Le

prospectus est un document officiel, tenant lieu d'offre &eacute;crite pour la vente de titres.

Avant d'acheter un fonds, lisez ce document attentivement pour comprendre quels sont les

objectifs du fonds et pour savoir s'ils correspondent aux v&ocirc;tres.



<P><b>Frais</b>

<p><b>L</b>es frais li&eacute;s &agrave; un fonds mutuel sont d&eacute;crits dans le

prospectus. Les honoraires, qui comprennent les frais de gestion et autres frais d'exploitation,

sont pay&eacute;s directement &agrave; m&ecirc;me l'actif du fonds. Les frais sont

assum&eacute;s par l'investisseur : il peut s'agir de commissions ou de frais de courtage. Certains

fonds sont vendus sans frais d'acquisition, c'est-&agrave;-dire sans frais &agrave; l'achat ni

&agrave; la vente.



<p><b>&lt;&lt; Connaissance du client &gt;&gt;</b> La loi exige que le repr&eacute;sentant

en fonds mutuels demande &agrave; l'investisseur des renseignements de base sur sa situation

financi&egrave;re, ses objectifs de placement et sa connaissance du placement. M&ecirc;me si

cette fa&ccedil;on de proc&eacute;der peut &ecirc;tre per&ccedil;ue comme une intrusion dans

la vie priv&eacute;e, elle vise &agrave; faire en sorte que les meilleurs int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts de

l'investisseur soient respect&eacute;s et qu'il &eacute;vite de faire de mauvais choix.

<hr>

<h3>COMPRENDRE LES RISQUES</H3>

<B>L</B>orsqu'on investit, la part de risque peut varier consid&eacute;rablement. Une

r&egrave;gle d'or : plus le rendement escompt&eacute; est &eacute;lev&eacute;, plus grand est

le risque. C'est ce qu'on appelle le &lt;&lt; rapport risque-rendement &gt;&gt;.<br><br>



<center>

<IMG SRC="fr-mut2.gif">

</center><br><br>



<p><b>L</b>orsqu'on place son argent dans les fonds mutuels, la volatilit&eacute; et le

rendement d&eacute;pendent des tendances du march&eacute;, des titres d&eacute;tenus par le

fonds et du style propre au gestionnaire. Sauf dans le cas des fonds du march&eacute;

mon&eacute;taire, qui sont g&eacute;r&eacute;s de mani&egrave;re &agrave; garder une valeur

unitaire stable, la valeur liquidative fluctuera suivant l'&eacute;tat des march&eacute;s.



<hr>

<h3>PARTIR DU BON PIED</h3>

<b>P</b>uisque tout le monde a des besoins et des objectifs diff&eacute;rents, la sagesse du

choix repose sur le fait de comprendre o&ugrave; l'on se trouve maintenant et o&ugrave; l'on

souhaite &ecirc;tre demain. Donc, avant d'investir dans un fonds mutuel, il faut se poser trois

grandes questions :

<P><b>Q</b>uel objectif financier est-ce que je tente d'atteindre?



<P><b>D</b>e combien de temps est-ce que je dispose pour atteindre cet objectif?



<P><b>Q</b>uelle part de risque puis-je tol&eacute;rer en cours de route?



<P><b>L</b>es r&eacute;ponses &agrave; ces questions vous aideront &agrave; choisir le

fonds ou les fonds qui vous conviennent le mieux. TD a con&ccedil;u

le Mod&egrave;le de r&eacute;partition d'actif, un guide en trois &eacute;tapes qui vous

aidera &agrave; choisir la combinaison de fonds mutuels d'actions, d'obligations et de titres du

march&eacute; mon&eacute;taire la mieux adapt&eacute;e &agrave; votre seuil de risque.

<H2>FONDS CANADIEN INDEX&Eacute; ET FONDS AM&Eacute;RICAIN

INDEX&Eacute;</H2>



<b>L</b>es fonds index&eacute;s ont un objectif bien d&eacute;fini : obtenir le m&ecirc;me

rendement qu'un indice de r&eacute;f&eacute;rence du march&eacute;. La chose est possible

gr&acirc;ce &agrave; une gestion professionnelle et experte des placements et &agrave; des

techniques informatiques sophistiqu&eacute;es. L'hypoth&egrave;se de d&eacute;part de

l'indexation veut que les march&eacute;s financiers progressent &agrave; longue

&eacute;ch&eacute;ance et qu'il soit tr&egrave;s difficile pour les gestionnaires

&lt;&lt;actifs&gt&gt; de battre syst&eacute;matiquement les indices du march&eacute;. En fait,

au cours des cinq ann&eacute;es qui se sont termin&eacute;es le 30 juin 1995, seulement 42

des 110 fonds d'actions canadiennes ont r&eacute;ussi &agrave; surpasser l'indice du

rendement total TSE 300.



<P><b>L</b>a gamme des fonds Ligne Verte offre deux fonds qui reproduisent de grands

indices boursiers : le Fonds canadien index&eacute; est align&eacute; sur l'indice de

rendement global TSE 300 et le Fonds am&eacute;ricain index&eacute;, sur l'indice Standard &

Poor's 500. Ces deux indices sont les plus reconnus au sein de leur march&eacute; respectifs. 



<P><b>L</b>es deux fonds offrent une grande diversification, un rendement historique

sup&eacute;rieur &agrave; la moyenne et des frais de gestion peu &eacute;lev&eacute;s. Les

indices sont compos&eacute;s d'actions de grandes entreprises dont les

b&eacute;n&eacute;fices affichent en g&eacute;n&eacute;ral une excellente tenue et dont les

dividendes sont vers&eacute;s r&eacute;guli&egrave;rement. Ces fonds comportent

&eacute;galement des frais de gestion moindres, car ils ne font pas appel &agrave; de

co&ucirc;teuses recherches. 



<P><b>N</b>'&eacute;tant disponible qu'en dollars am&eacute;ricains, le

Fonds am&eacute;ricain index&eacute; offre &eacute;galement une diversification

mon&eacute;taire. Cette particularit&eacute; peut vous prot&eacute;ger contre une baisse du

huard par rapport au dollar am&eacute;ricain. Le fonds est un placement &eacute;tranger

admissible au REER, compte tenu du plafond de 20 %.

<p>Planning your estate is a key part of your life plan.  It can be one of the most important things you do for your family and for yourself.  In essence, an estate plan sets out how you want your assets distributed after your death, so that your beneficiaries receive the greatest possible benefit.  It also lets you ensure that the wishes you have for your estate are carried out.  

<p>There is vital information on this site for your review that is intended to provide guidance in the development of an effective estate plan, including preparation and on-going management of your will.

<P>Managing your day-to-day finances is more than just making deposits and
withdrawals, writing cheques and getting a monthly statement. With a little
planning, you can save time, reduce service charges and earn more interest.



<P>Here is a check list of some of the keys to saving while you bank:

<OL>
<LI><A HREF="#1">Choose The Right Account</A>
<LI><A HREF="#2">Keep a No-Charge Balance</A>
<LI><A HREF="#3">Use Self-Service Banking</A>
<LI><A HREF="#4">Make Pre-Authorized Payments</A>

</OL>

<HR>

<H3><A NAME="1">1</A>. Choose The Right Account</H3>

<P>By taking a little time to evaluate how you want to bank and what your needs
are, you'll have a better idea of what the right account approach for you might
be. There are many bank account options available now. So whether you prefer a
bank account that charges fees on a per transaction basis (a fee charged on
individual transactions that you complete) or on a packaged fee or service plan
basis, you can find a good service fit. <P><A
HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/pers/select/">For a TD Account Selector
recommendation</A>




<H3><A NAME="2">2</A>. Keep a No-Charge Balance</H3>

<P>With most TD accounts, a $1,000 minimum monthly balance cancels the self-service
banking and the cheque and in-branch withdrawal fees. A $250 balance
eliminates any monthly maintenance fee your account might have. <P><A
HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/pers/select/">For a TD Account Selector
recommendation</A>


<H3><A NAME="3">3</A>. Use Self-Service Banking</H3>

<P>You save on fees every time you use your TD Personal Access card for self-service banking transactions. When you
withdraw cash at The Green Machine or Green Fast Cash machine, for instance, or
transfer funds using The Updater or Bankline telephone banking, you pay a lower service charge
compared to the in-branch fee. Paying bills using The Green Machine or Bankline
costs 50 compared to $1.30 in-branch for the handling fee. And when you shop with <I>Interac</I>
Direct Payment, you transfer funds directly from your TD account and can save up to
33% compared to a cheque service charge.

<P><A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/pers/select/">For a TD Account Selector recommendation</A>


<H3><A NAME="4">4</A>. Make Pre-Authorized Payments</H3>

<P>Instead of using cheques or in-branch transactions to pay your other fixed
monthly bills, you may arrange for the company to automatically debit your account
and save you up to 33% on bank fees every time. And you pay no fees at all if
you maintain the applicable no-charge level for the account.


<H3><A NAME="5">5</A>. Make Automatic Transfers </H3>

<P>Instead of using cheques or in-branch transactions to transfer funds between
accounts or to your TD RSP, ask for TD Personal Transfer Service. We'll
automatically transfer any fixed amount you choose, as often as you'd like. To
help you save, transfers to RSP accounts and My First Accounts are exempt from
the one-time set-up charge per arrangement.


<H3><A NAME="6">6</A>. Ask For Overdraft Protection</H3>

<P>For a low monthly fee we'll cover cheques you write up to your pre-arranged
limit*. You pay interest only on funds you need and avoid costly NSF charges.

<P><A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/lending/over.html">For more information on Overdraft Protection</A>

<P>*Subject to credit approval, interest charges and applicable agreement. 


<H3><A NAME="7">7</A>. Shop With TD VISA</H3>

<P>You'll reduce repeated chequing and withdrawal fees by paying one monthly
cheque to VISA - and no handling fee if you pay your VISA bill through The
Green Machine or Bankline telephone banking.

<P><A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/Creditctr/">For more information on TD Visa</A>

<H3><A NAME="8">8</A>.  Choose a Flat Fee Service Plan</H3>

<P>Pay just one monthly fee for your account transactions charges.  We offer a range of plans to meet a variety of banking needs.

<p>Wealth management is an integral part of the Life Planning process.  It is the process of actively planning and optimizing the performance of your capital, in accordance with your financial goals.  Many individuals have invested the time to develop the right financial strategy for themselves because they know, having worked, saved and invested to build financial security, that managing hard-earned resources is too important and complex a task to leave to chance.  

<p>Your needs for income or growth, your age, tax and family situation, the level of risk you are comfortable with - all these factors and more need to be considered when looking at the development of a wealth management plan. To find out more about your own financial future, please answer the following question:

<H2>What dreams have you got under your hood?</H2>

<P>Whatever shape your automotive dream takes, buying a car is a big thrill, and a big
expense.  It's important that you have the facts you need to make an informed decision...not 
just about what make and model to buy and how to get the best price, but also about 
the different kinds of financing available to you today.

<H2>It's true: It takes money to make money.</H2>

<P>That old saying has never been more accurate. But where can an
astute investor get the money to take advantage of opportunities
when they come along? The answer can be a personal loan--a plan
that gets you the cash you need, when you need it, to benefit
from investment opportunities.

<P>There are many valuable investments that you can profit from.
Some are important in the short term, and others can lead to
financial stability and security down the road. One of the
safest and smartest investments you can make in your future is
in a <A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/RRSP/index.htm">Registered Retirement Savings Plan</A>. An RRSP investment can
make a huge difference to your quality of life when you retire
-- the difference between merely &quot;getting by&quot; and getting the
most out of life. Your financial institution can assist you in determing your
<A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/RRSP/regs.htm">RRSP contribution limit</A>.

Whether you're interested in <A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/lending/tdinv.html">taking out a loan</A> for an immediate investment opportunity or are considering your longer-term retirement portfolio, your financial institution can provide helpful advice.

<H3><a name="Letter">Letter to Shareholders</a></H3>
<P>
<H4>BY DELIVERING MORE TO OUR CUSTOMERS IN 1995, WE DELIVERED MORE TO YOU, OUR SHAREHOLDERS.</H4>

<P>Your Bank increased dividends, strengthened its capital base, and invested in new businesses and operations to generate future growth while achieving record earnings of $794 million. Net income per common share increased by 17% from 1994, thanks to record net interest income, record other income, and the lowest loan losses in over a decade. To reflect these improvements, we are increasing the quarterly dividend per common share in the first quarter of 1996 by $.03 - the third increase in the last two years.

<P>This strong performance in a period of modest economic growth reflects exceptional efforts throughout the Bank - in our traditional businesses and in our new ones. This has improved return on equity - our key benchmark for the delivery of shareholder value.

<P>But there is another goal which is also vital, and that is making banking easier and more satisfying for our customers. And we have a key performance measure for that - our Customer Service Index, a detailed annual survey of over 100,000 customers. In the past year, we saw this index increase by two percentage points to over 80%, which means customers rate TD as "very good" in terms of service.

<P>We aim to excel, improving our performance in all our businesses by this measure every year, in keeping with our public promise, "Your Bank. Your Way.", and the theme of our new advertising campaign, "We're here to help make it easier." We cannot deliver to shareholders if we do not deliver to customers.

<P>Delivering superior service is one of the ways we at TD have been differentiating ourselves from the competition - one of our core strengths. We also differentiate ourselves as the integrated bank, and the bank of industry specialization.

<P>Our strategy to integrate the delivery of a wide range of services and products is our response to customers who told us they want one person to handle all their various dealings with TD - enabling us to tailor financial solutions from a full range of approaches. We have now integrated to the point that one relationship officer represents the bank to each of our corporate, institutional and business clients - and, increasingly, our personal customers.

<P>As the bank of industry specialization, we have used our industry expertise to enter new markets and build new businesses. Our specialization adds great value to our relationships and enhances our ability to advise our customers.

<P>Our strategy is to build on these core strengths - and we have clear benchmarks for measuring our success.</P>

<H4>WE'RE HERE TO HELP MAKE IT EASIER FOR OUR CORPORATE AND INSTITUTIONAL CUSTOMERS</H4>

<P>Integration and industry specialization have propelled our corporate and investment banking business in North America and around the world.

<P>Our corporate lending has shown solid growth as we have established ourselves as a well-capitalized bank that can fully underwrite loans. An indication of our success is the fact that we are one of the top banks in loan syndications in the United States.

<P>In recent years, we have broadened our ability to serve corporate and institutional clients with the development of investment banking capabilities. As the only Canadian bank to build rather than buy a securities dealer, we have been working to get all the essential elements in place, and in 1995, we accelerated our build of TD Securities Inc.

<P>We acquired Lancaster Financial Holdings Inc. - a highly respected financial advisory firm with strong mergers and acquisitions capabilities. With this acquisition, the launching of a merchant banking business, and the recruiting of strong individuals and teams - including a highly rated Eurobond team in London, and both a high yield group and a bond lending and borrowing (repo) team in New York - we have demonstrated to our customers that we are a major player in the securities business.

<P>Indeed, during 1995, we built on our lead as number one in Canada in private placements, and we became the leader in asset securitization and one of the top players in merchant banking. We had the best market share gains in fixed income and in institutional equity research, sales and trading. Perhaps even more significant in terms of future growth, we were ranked #1 overall in momentum - with both issuers and investors. We aim to maintain the momentum.

<P>TD Securities now has a staff of close to 2,000 in 58 offices, and revenues of over $350 million. And while building in Canada, we moved ahead in the U.S. market, where we had already established a strong mergers and acquisitions business.

<P>TD Securities (USA) Inc. gained Tier II investment banking powers in August, allowing us to underwrite and deal in debt and equity securities in the United States - which in turn allows us to provide a broader range of integrated service to our American and cross-border clients.

<P>In a globalized marketplace, this means supporting clients in key markets. 
We broadened our international presence this year with the opening of a representative office in Mexico and a trade finance operation in Houston, while gaining approval to proceed in the year ahead with a branch in India and a representative office in Chile. We aim to exceed our customers' domestic and international expectations.

<H4>WE'RE HERE TO HELP MAKE IT EASIER FOR OUR BUSINESS CUSTOMERS</H4>

<P>We have been working hard to meet the needs of Canada's small and medium-sized businesses - an increasingly important part of the Canadian economy and of our customer base. With our focus on relationships and providing the best products and services, we have made considerable progress: in 1995, we saw substantial increases in the number of customers we serve in this sector, and in our loans to small business.

<P>A key initiative of 1995 was the development of TD Main$treet Banking, our program to expand delivery of business banking services through our entire branch network. This broadens the reach of services previously available only at our Commercial Banking Centres and responds to the needs of small business customers who prefer to deal with their local branch. At the same time, it provides us with an opportunity to integrate delivery of business banking, personal banking, and investment services for entrepreneurs. TD Main$treet Banking is now available at two-thirds of our branches and will be extended to every branch in Canada in 1996.

<P>To reinforce the commitment of our Business Banking Relationship Standards code and build on initiatives such as TD's Independent Business Advisory Panel, we have appointed a senior officer of the Bank as TD's first Ombudsman. Reporting directly to the Chairman, the Ombudsman's mandate is to improve relationships between the Bank and our customers by resolving disputes fairly and professionally, while advising senior management as to sources and causes of disputes, so we can improve service.

<H4>WE'RE HERE TO HELP MAKE IT EASIER FOR OUR PERSONAL CUSTOMERS</H4>

<P>Over the years, we have developed technology to provide customers with a range of low-priced delivery options for many of their transactions - from our Green Machines to phone and computer banking and brokerage, to satellite banking in the Yukon, to TD Direct Payment, our highly successful debit card operation.

<P>Having improved access and convenience with these new delivery systems, we have repositioned our 943 retail branches across Canada as value-added service centres, where we meet a range of our customers' needs. We have removed many of the administrative functions from our branches, enabling staff to focus on sales and service quality; for example, 5,000 TD employees are qualified to sell mutual funds, and have just completed our Mutual Fund National Education Review. At the same time, our branches are providing longer hours of service than our bank competitors, and faster service, with our $5 Service Guarantee.

<P>A major step forward in the delivery of value-added, integrated services in 1995 was the successful transformation of 180 key branches to TD BANK & TRUST - the first such transformation by a Canadian bank. This move improves our customers' access to estate planning and administration, investment counselling and portfolio management.

<P>We also extended our trust services to the administration of offshore trusts and estates, with the establishment of TD Trust (Bermuda) Limited - broadening the portfolio of wealth management services available to our customers. As well, we established U.S. operations for Green Line Investor Services Inc., our discount broker which has long been the clear leader in Canada - providing Canadians in the United States and American customers with prompt and inexpensive access to Canadian securities markets and dual currency accounts.

<P>In the past two years, Green Line has been complemented by our full service broker TD Evergreen Investment Services Inc. Across Canada, we now have over 110 Investment Advisors in 26 Evergreen branches, which have forged strong relationships with TD Bank branches - broadening the array of financial services and advice available to customers of both operations.

<P>While integrating services and providing higher levels of advice for customers throughout our retail businesses, we developed a number of new products to meet customer needs - such as the highly flexible TD GOLD TRAVEL CARD, and six new mutual funds - including our Science and Technology Fund, which achieved a one-year performance record of 56.2% for the year - one of the best records of all mutual funds in Canada.

<H4>CELEBRATING EXCELLENCE</H4>

<P>In our new advertising campaign, we say thank you to customers for entrusting us with their business and their money. That trust is due to the people who serve them - the people of TD Bank. They are working harder than ever to help make it easier.

<P>In recognition of superior efforts throughout your Bank, we launched our first TD Award of Excellence program this year - honouring 122 individuals and teams at the national level. All were nominated and selected by their peers, and the selection committees received over 3,000 nominations - an indication of the depth of achievement at TD.

<P>Beyond their efforts to meet our customers' needs, TD people are actively involved in their communities, volunteering their time and giving generously through our employee donation fund. To support these efforts, which reflect well on the Bank, we have strengthened and refocused our corporate donations program - with a special focus on the youth of Canada.

<H4>FUTURE PROGRESS</H4>

<P>We anticipate lingering political uncertainty and slow economic growth as we enter 1996 - so we aim to outperform the economy once again by building businesses and services that meet our customers' needs. We believe we have the core strengths, strategies, management depth and entrepreneurial leadership in our various businesses to make further progress towards our goals for improving shareholder value.

<P>In the year ahead, we will work to deliver more to our shareholders by making it easier for our customers.

<P>
<H4>STRATEGIES FOR DELIVERING VALUE</H4>

<P><b>W</b>ith a solid financial performance and progress in developing our businesses, TD
had a positive impact on the financial security of a lot of people in 1996. We contributed through
the returns we delivered to shareholders, through the products and services we provided to
customers, through the taxes - over $800 million in 1996 - we paid as one of canada's largest
taxpayers, through our role as a major employer, and through the business financing we provided
that generated economic growth.

<P><b>I</b>n striving to deliver more, we have been reshaping and expanding the products,
services and businesses of the Bank. The new section that follows this letter - Review of TD's
Businesses - was designed to give you a sense of the scope and scale of our businesses and their
markets, strategies and performance.

<P><b>A</b>s you will see in Review of TD's Businesses, our core traditional banking
businesses for retail and corporate customers are large, healthy and profitable, but growth is
constrained. 

<h4>DRIVING CHANGE</h4>

<P><b>T</b>here are a number of reasons for this: a slow growth, low inflation economic
environment; intense price competition; changing demographics which have seen North
America's huge baby boom population shift its focus from borrowing to investing; ongoing
disintermediation which has enabled corporate clients to access financing directly in the capital
markets rather than through banking intermediaries; and globalization and technology which
have reduced barriers to entry and increased competition in our traditional businesses and
markets.

<P><b>T</b>hese are the challenges we have been facing in our efforts to contribute more to
shareholders and customers. In responding to these challenges, we have worked to build on the
strong foundation provided by our traditional banking businesses by accelerating investment in a
number of high growth, high return areas where we believe we can achieve success based on our
existing strengths. These include investment banking, brokerage services, mutual funds,
investment management and electronic banking.

<H4>PROGRESS IN '96</H4>
<P><b>W</b>e made exceptional progress in all these areas in 1996, as discussed in Review of
TD's Businesses. Most notably:
<ul>
<li><b>t</b>hrough acquisition, we expanded our discount brokerage and our investment
management businesses;

<li><b>t</b>hrough internal growth we made strong gains in mutual funds (where we are now
number two among Canadian banks), investment banking (where TD Securities Inc., our
investment dealer, has established itself as a significant player) and full service brokerage (where
TD Evergreen Investment Services is now a national firm); 

<li><b>a</b>nd through ongoing development and investments in technology, we stayed at the
forefront in providing convenient electronic &quot;virtual banking&quot; services - launching
TD Access: PC, North America's first fully integrated banking and brokerage PC package.</ul>

<h4>CAPITAL STRATEGIES</h4>

<P><b>T</b>D's strong capital position makes it possible for us to pursue opportunities in all
the businesses we have targeted for accelerated growth and we are proceeding in a disciplined
way. Just as customers and shareholders are becoming increasingly strategic, focused and
disciplined in their investments - to build security in changing times - so too is your Bank.

<P><b>T</b>he buyback we announced in the third quarter for up to 10% of TD's shares
underscores our focus on shareholder value and our disciplined approach to capital investment.
We believe excess capital should be returned to shareholders if current opportunities do not meet
our objectives for building value. Our target hurdle is an after-tax rate of return of 15% of capital
invested in acquiring new businesses or expanding existing ones.

<P><b>T</b>his disciplined approach led to our decision to sell TD's institutional and pension
custody business in the fourth quarter. We recognized that even with substantial investment, we
could not become a large enough player in that business to generate satisfactory returns. We do,
however, have that opportunity in the businesses we have singled out for accelerated growth.

<H4>WATERHOUSE IMPACT</H4>

<P><b>O</b>ne of the areas we have targeted is discount brokerage, and in 1996, we doubled
our presence in this rapidly growing market with the acquisition of Waterhouse Investor
Services, Inc., the fourth largest discount broker in the United States. Waterhouse is comparable
in size to Green Line Investor Services, Canada's leading discount broker. 

<P><b>T</b>his was the largest acquisition in your Bank's history and it has made TD the third
largest discount broker in the world, and the only one with a North American franchise. We see
global opportunities in this business, and will benefit from our increased size and scope with new
economies of scale, market reach and the sharing of technology between Waterhouse and Green
Line. 

<P><b>T</b>his acquisition is also significant as the first major move we have made in the
retail sector outside Canada. As an electronically based business that is licenced as a broker in all
50 states and currently has 90 branches in 41 states, Waterhouse represents an important delivery
system as well as a product. Furthermore, it has a national bank charter in the United States -
providing a national franchise in a country where retail banking operations tend to be regional.
We are exploring opportunities to deliver a broader range of financial services through
Waterhouse to its customer base of 600,000. Again, TD's strong capital position enables us to
pursue attractive opportunities, and we broadened access to capital in the United States by listing
TD's common shares on the New York Stock Exchange in the fourth quarter.

<H4>MAKING IT EASIER</H4>

<P><b>W</b>hile we put shareholders' capital to good use in building the future value of the
Bank, TD people across Canada and around the world worked hard to build our businesses
internally and to make banking easier and more enjoyable for customers. 

<P><b>T</b>hanks to their efforts, TD enhanced customer service as well as returns to
shareholders. Our Customer Service Index, the most important internal measure for TD's service
delivery, improved further during 1996 - a record level of 83% of our customers rate TD's service
as very good.

<h4>RESPONDING TO COMMUNITIES</h4>
<P><b>W</b>e are making gains in a difficult and competitive environment - and in the
process, we are delivering positive benefits to the communities where we operate. As noted, we
contribute as a major taxpayer and by providing valuable financial services. In building our
businesses, we have been attempting to make the delivery of those services more responsive to
the needs of local communities. 
<P><b>O</b>ne example of this is our Main$treet Banking initiative which has moved the
delivery of commercial services for small businesses into every single branch in TD's network,
enabling small businesses to do their banking right in their local community. A second example
is our ongoing development of Asian banking services in Canada and the Pacific Rim, which
services were enhanced during the year with the opening of a Green Line office in Hong Kong.
Yet another example can be seen in our launch of the First Nations Bank of Canada - focused on
aboriginal banking and investment - jointly with the Saskatchewan Indian Equity Foundation,
Inc. and the Federation of Saskatchewan Indian Nations, Inc.

<P><b>A</b>s well, we have become more responsive to our communities by becoming more
strategic in our corporate donations program. In last year's report, we mentioned that we had
boosted our donations budget and developed a special focus on youth - the future of our
communities. To this end in 1996, we helped launch Career Edge, an internship opportunity
providing young people with work experience in corporations across the country; we also
announced a new bursary program, where TD will channel higher education giving directly to
students in order to improve their access to post-secondary education.


<H4>BUILDING VALUE</H4>
<P><b>C</b>learly, TD is investing in the future in many different ways - to build the future of
the Bank. In doing so, we have been building future value for all of you - our direct shareholders
- and for millions of Canadians who are indirect shareholders through their pension funds and
mutual funds. While building for the future, we delivered solid returns to shareholders in 1996,
as earnings per share grew by 18% to $2.95, and as total market return, including dividends,
reached 36.2% compared to 20.1% in 1995. We aim to deliver more.

<P><b>W</b>e do not expect the pace of change to diminish in the year ahead - given the forces
of technology, demographics, competition and globalization. The challenges continue. But we
believe we have the strategies and strength to make further progress in 1997 - benefiting
shareholders, customers and the communities we serve.

<H2>If you don't like surprises...</H2>

<P>Now and then, even the most prudent of people can accidentally
write a cheque without sufficient funds to cover it. The
resulting stress, embarrassment and cost can make you wish you
had some kind of protection against overdrafts.

<P>The financial tool to consider to avoid dealing with &quot;NSF&quot; (Not Sufficient Funds) situations is what many financial institutions call Overdraft Protection. It's a line of credit that's there if and when you need it, like a financial safety net.

<P>The other financial tool to consider to ensure that you always
have the flexibility to access additional funds is called a Line
of Credit. Once you've qualified to use a line of credit you are
provided with a credit limit and are free to access the funds at
any time and for any purpose.

Find out if a <A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/lending/tdsel.html">Line of Credit</A> or <A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/lending/tdover.html">Overdraft Protection</A> is
right for you.

<H2>Got big plans for a little house?</H2>

<P>You can probably think of a thousand ways your home could be
bigger, more comfortable, more practical and modern. Sure, you
could move. But you love the neighbourhood, and you love your
house, too.

<P>Often, the really smart option is a home renovation. Without the
cost of moving, you'll be making a huge difference to your
lifestyle, and giving your home real additional value at resale
time. Look at renovating the kitchen and the bathroom first, or
perhaps adding a deck or family room upgrade. Experts agree that
these are the areas potential buyers are most interested in.

<P>So take a good look at your home, then get started. With the
<A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/lending/tdimp.html">right home renovation loan</A>, the house you've always wanted can
be the house you already own.

<hr>


<P><A NAME="1"><B>1. How easy is it to get a loan?</B></A>

<P>The process is really very simple. The information you'll need to provide is:

<ul> <li>The purpose of the loan

<li>Your name address, birth date and social insurance number <li>Employment and
income details

<li>Your assets, such as car, bank accounts, investments, house etc.

<li>Your liabilities, including any loans, credit card balances, mortgages etc.,
and the total of your monthly payments. </ul>

<P>Your banker will help you choose from all the different loan options
available, based on your personal needs. Then a credit assessment will be made
based on your ability to repay, your credit history and your residence and
employment stability. You can arrange for a loan where you bank or even over the
phone. And you'll probably have your answer within 24 hours!


<P><B><A NAME="2">2. I always avoided taking out a loan -- I guess I felt they
were for people with financial trouble. Are there other reasons I might want a
loan?</A></B>

<P>These days loans can be powerful financial tools. You can use them to acquire
assets like a car, a computer or a boat. You can take out a loan to improve your
home, or to contribute to an RRSP or some other valuable investment.


<P><B><A NAME="3">3. Do different types of loans come with different terms and
rates, or are they all the same?</A></B>

<P>Generally, terms of 1 to 5 years are available on most loans, and the rate may
vary with the term of the loan. RRSP loans are available at a lower rate, and
special rates may also be available on other types of loans from time to time.
With a personal line of credit, once you have qualified, you are provided with a
credit limit and are free to access the funds at any time and for any purpose. 
Interest rates on lines of credit vary, but they ususally compare favourably with
loan rates.  Just ask your financial institution for details.

<P><B><A NAME="4">4. Isn't it expensive to take out a loan? </A> </B>
<P>Borrowing costs depend on the interest rate you're being charged, and on the
amount of the loan and its term. The total cost of your loan is detailed on the
&quot;Statement of Disclosure&quot; given to all loan customers at the time they
take out the loan.



<P><B><A NAME="5">5. How is the interest calculated on my loan?</A></B>

<P>Interest is calculated daily on the outstanding principal balance and payable
monthly.

<P><B><A NAME="6">6. How are my payments stuctured?</A></B>

<p>For fixed terms loans, each monthly payment consists of a portion of interest
and a portion of principal.  The proportion of interest is higher in the first
payment, and it reduces as the principal is repaid.

<P>For lines of credit, there are various repayment options, including interest
only.

<P><B><A NAME="7">7. I'm a student and I have heard that there are special types
of loans that I might qualify for.  What are they?</A></B>

<P><P>Most financial institutions will assist students in obtaining financing for
post secondary studies. Bank managers realize that students at this stage of
their lives have a limited ability to repay a loan quickly, and so student loans
typically have extended repayment terms.

<P>Your financial institution can provide all the details you need.


<P><B><A NAME="8">8. How do I go about applying for a loan?</A> </B> <P>Call the
nearest branch of your financial institution. They'll be more than happy to help
you.

<P><B><A NAME="9">9. What happens once I apply for a loan?</A></B>

<P>Your financial institution will consider your request, based on your personal
information, and a credit assessment will be made. Usually you'll receive an
answer within 24 hours.

<P><B><A NAME="10">10. I've heard people talk about the importance of having a
good credit rating. What does that mean, and how do I get one?</A></B>

<P>A good credit rating means that you have repaid past debts in a timely manner.
If you make your payments as agreed, on time and in full, you will automatically
have a good credit rating.

<P><B><A NAME="11">11. What is a co-signor? Who can co-sign a loan?</A></B>

<P>The co-signor is a person who becomes equally responsible for repaying the
loan as you are. If you, the primary borrower, stop making payments on the loan,
the co-signor would be responsible for the payments. Anyone of age of majority
can offer to co-sign for you.

<P><B><A NAME="12">12. People say that having &quot;collateral&quot; is important
in getting a loan. What is collateral, and how much do I need?</A> </B>
<P>Collateral is security for a loan. If you fail to repay the loan, the
financial institution can take the collateral. Collateral isn't required
on all loans; it depends on factors such as the amount of the loan, the purpose, the repayment period, etc...

<P><B><A NAME="13">13. How long will I have to wait for the money?</A></B>

<P>Once your loan is approved, which usually takes about one day, the loan amount
can be advanced to your bank account or issued as a bank draft. Depending on the purpose, the
bank draft might be issued directly to a third party, such as a car dealer.




<P><B><A NAME="14">14. What happens if I'm turned down for a loan?</A> </B>
<P>Try to determine why you were turned down, and find out if there are any ways
the loan can get approved. Perhaps you need to put more money down, provide collateral security or have a
co-signor.



<P><A NAME="15"><B>15. It seems as though everyone offers different interest
rates. How can I ensure that the rate I'm getting is the best?</B></A>

<P>The interest rates charged by financial institutions fluctuate because rates
are set competitively and move to reflect the latest market conditions.  By
asking for the best rate and comparing rates between institutions, you will be in
a better position to know whether the rate quoted is competitive or not.  Keep in
mind that consolidating your banking business at one institution can help you
obtain even better rates and that customer service and convenience are also
important factors.

<P><B><A NAME="16">16. Is a bank the only place I can get a loan? And does it
have to be a bank I have an account with?</A></B>

<P>All banks, trust companies and finance companies offer loans to their
customers. You don't have to have any other product or service at that bank to
apply for a loan.




<P><B><A NAME="17">17. Can I pay out my loan early, or are there charges I need
to watch out for?</A></B>

<P>You can pay off your loan any time you like, usually with no early repayment
penalties.

<P><B><A NAME="18">18. What happens if I miss a payment?</A></B>

<P>Missing a loan payment puts your loan in arrears. If this happens, you should
immediately contact your lender in order to explain the situation, and to make
repayment arrangements.

<P><B><A NAME="19">19. Job security is always an issue, especially these days.
What would happen if I was laid off?</A></B>

<P>In the unfortunate event of a job loss, you would continue to be responsible
for repaying your debts in a timely manner. Your bank will be glad to help you
determine the best way to allocate your income to meet expenses, including your
loan payments.

<H2>How can you cure the student Money Blues?</H2>



<P>The chance to go to a College or university is an exciting and important opportunity for you.

But it's tough to learn when your mind is clouded with questions about money...&quot;Where

will I get the cash I need for tuition? Books and <A

HREF="tdcomp.html">computer equipment</A>? Living

expenses?&quot;



<P>As a Student, you're in a unique position -- you need money for your education, but until you

finish school it's hard to hold down the kind of job you need to pay the bills. And when it comes

to student loan programs some students don't qualify and others may need more than is available.



<P>That's why some major lending institutions offer students plans that let them borrow money

for tuition, computers, and other living expenses even though they may not have a job or even

collateral, with the help of a co-signor. These loans usually feature relatively low interest rates

and extended payback terms. It's the financial aid students need, and institutions know that

helping young people achieve a complete education is a solid investment in the future.



<P>Find out whether your financial institution is ready to help you <A

HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/pers/student/stline.html">finance the education</A> you

want.

since you have to replace it every few years, car payments are
an ongoing fact of life.

<P>At TD Bank, we arrange thousands of car loans every year, so
we have the know-how to help you find the type of loan you can live with.
Talk to us about pre-arranging your loan, so you can be on the road
right away once you find the car of your dreams. 

<H3>Competitive Rates</H3>

<P>Our rates are among the best, and our loans offer you the
flexibility you need for monthly payments you can afford. Or if a
line of credit is what you need instead of a loan, we
can help you arrange that, too.  See if <A
HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/lending/tdsel.html">TD Select Line</a> is for you.

<H3>Fixed and Variable Rates</H3>

<P>With a TD fixed rate loan, you'll be protected against interest rate fluctuations.
On the other hand, our variable rate loan lets you take advantage of declining
interest rates and you always have the option
of switching back to a fixed rate loan if rates go up.

<H3>Relax with TD Loan Insurance</H3>

<P>For just a few dollars a month, TD GreenPlan Loan Insurance covers your
personal loan payments if you become disabled. It pays up to your total
outstanding balance in the event of your death to a maximum of $200,000.  Low
cost protection for real peace of mind.


<H3>TD GREEN or TD GOLD TRAVEL CARD Auto Club</H3>

<P>For a low monthly fee, <A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/Creditctr/prodinfo/tdcards/tdgreen.html">TD GREEN Visa Cardholders</A>
and <A HREF="http://www.tdbank.ca/tdbank/Creditctr/prodinfo/tdcards/tdtravel.html">TD GOLD TRAVEL Cardholders</A> can

<P>TD Select Line is one of the best personal credit products on the market today, and it can make your life a lot easier.

<P>TD Select Line is a revolving line of credit that provides instant access to cash up to your approved limit, and can be used again and again, so you don't have to spend time making individual loan applications each time you need funds.  The Select Line can be fully or partially secured by the equity in your home, by liquid assets such as GICs, stocks and bonds, or it may be unsecured.

<P>To use the funds, simply write a Select Line cheque.  You can also make cash withdrawals or transfers at any TD branch or at the Green Machine.

<P>Based on your credit limit and the security you provide, your Select Line interest rate could be as low as prime, which is less than what you pay for credit cards, Overdraft Protection and most Personal Installment Loans.  You pay interest only on the funds you use and there are no annual fees or ongoing service charges.

<P>You can choose from three monthly repayment options to match your budget:

<ul>
<li>Fixed monthly payments;
<li>3% of the outstanding balance or $50, whichever is greater;
<li>Interest only (if secured).
</ul>

<P>You can also make additional payments whenever you like, without penalty.

<P>To apply for TD Select Line, download the TD Personal Credit Application
form, provided here. (Please note the form is in Adobe(TM) Acrobat(TM)
format (.pdf) so you will need Adobe(TM) Acrobat(TM) to read it. If you do not

<P>Borrowing money to make money can be a sensible option these days.



Often, borrowing money can be



the best way to make sure you don't miss out on important



investment opportunities.







<P>Your investment loan with TD Bank can take the form of a



personal loan, with a flexible and convenient repayment



schedule. If you're borrowing to invest in an RRSP, TD Bank has



a number of investments to choose from. Each one can help you make the most of this important



investment in your future financial security.







<P>If you invest in a TD RRSP, your TD RRSP Prime Rate Loan is pre-approved for up to



$13,500, without delay. And when you look



at the benefits of your RRSP investment, it's clear that making



your maximum contribution each and every year is an outstanding



decision. For example, the net benefit of borrowing $1,000 for



an RRSP contribution is $446 after one year. Missing a single



$1,000 contribution at age 30 can cost you $31,409 in missed



earnings by age 70 (based on a 9% annual rate of interest and assuming you



do not carry forward this contribution to a future year).







<P>With TD's Future Plan RRSP, you can actually double your



investment! When you take out an RRSP loan under TD Future Plan,



you make your regular payment of principal and interest on the amount you borrow, but the



portion of the  payment that would have gone towards your principal loan



repayment is instead transferred into your TD RSP investment.



Within 12 months you can



double your RRSP contribution!







<P>Find out more about the opportunities to have the kind of



retirement security you want.

<B>Mutual Funds Through Green Line</B>:
Mutual Funds are a hot topic these days and investors want more
choices to meet their investment objectives. Green Line delivers
one of the largest selections you'll find anywhere, offering you
access to almost 500 mutual funds. Recently, we expanded our list
of available funds to include BPI, Scudder Mutual Funds, Clarington
Capital Management.
<P>
A choice of commission structures
<P>
Green Line offers three types of mutual fund commission structures:

<UL>
<LI><B>Front Load</B> - As the name implies, front load is commission charges
at the time you  make your investment, based upon the following
schedule:
</UL>


Front Load Funds*                                                         
<table>
<tr><td>Value of Transactions</td><td>Commission</td></tr>
<tr><td>$1,000 - $4,999</td><td>2.5%</td></tr>                                                    
<tr><td>$5,000 - $24,999</td><td>2.0%</td></tr>
<tr><td>$25,000 and over</td><td>1.0%</td></tr>
</table>

<P>
* Charges apply to the purchase only and are based on gross dollars
invested.
<UL>
<LI><B>Rear Load</B> - With rear load mutual funds, no commissions apply
when you  purchase, although a commission will be charged by the
fund manager  when a fund is redeemed. Commissions are usually
based on a  declining percentage value over a specific number
of years, after which  the commission rate is zero.

<LI><B>No-Load</B> - Commission is not charged on the purchase of no-load
funds either,  although a $45 transaction fee is payable on redemption
(except on the  Green Line Family of No-Load Mutual Funds and
all money market  funds).  
</UL>

<P>
Note that mutual fund charges imposed by the fund company (i.e.
set-up and early redemption fees) are in addition to Green Line's
commissions, and vary with particular funds. Additional details
about fees and commissions can be found in each fund's prospectus
and Green Line's commission schedule.

<P>
<A NAME="U.S.ef"><B>U.S. Equity Funds:</B></A> These funds invest in
common stocks and other equity securities of U.S. companies. These funds may at
certain times also invest in securities of issuers in other countries and in
non-equity issues, such as short-term or medium-term debt instruments when
considered appropriate to reduce exposure to the equity markets.
<P>
<A NAME="select">&nbsp;</A><BR>

<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Basic Option Terminology</FONT></B>

<P>


<UL>
<LI><B>Options</B> are contracts that derive their value from underlying interests like stocks and bonds.

<LI><B>Calls</B> give holders the right
to buy underlying interests.

<LI><B>Puts</B> give holders the right
to sell underlying interests.

<LI><B>Underlying interest</B>
is the security on which the option is written.

<LI>When an option contract is first created, it is termed on
<B>Opening Transaction</B>. 

<LI>A<B> Closing Transaction</B> is the term used when an
option contract is eliminated through a secondary transaction.

<LI><B>Strike (Exercise) Price</B>
is the price at which the underlying interest can be bought or sold.

<LI>When you buy an option, as an opening transaction, you are
the <B>Buyer</B> or <B>Holder</B>. Holders have the right to buy the
underlying interest at the strike price (with a Call), or sell the underlying
interest at the strike price (with a Put).

<LI>When you sell an option, as an opening transaction, you are
the <B>Seller</B> or <B>Writer</B>. Writers are obligated to buy the
underlying interest at the strike price (with a Put) or sell the underlying
interest at the strike price (with a Call) if the contract is exercised.

<LI><B>Premium</B> is the price the
buyer pays to the seller for the option contract.

<LI><B>Expiry Date</B> is the date on
which the contract ceases to exist.

<LI><B>Exercise Style</B> is either
<B>European</B> (can only be exercised on the expiry date), or <B>American</B>
(can be exercised on any trading day prior to the expiry date).

<LI>Options are <B>At-the Money</B> when the market price of
the underlying interest is equal to it's strike price.

<LI>Options are <B>In-the-Money</B> when the price of the
underlying interest is above the Call's strike price, or below the Put's strike
price.

<LI>Options are <B>Out-of-the-Money</B> when the price of the
underlying interest is below the Call's strike price, or above the Put's strike
price.

</UL>
<UL>
<LI>The <B>Multiplier</B> is the term given to the number of
units of the underlying interest that make up one option contract.

</UL>
<P>


<BR>

<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Basic Characteristics of the Option Contract</FONT></B>
<UL>
<LI>Can be Very Risky
<LI>No Privileges of Ownership
<LI>Standardized Units of Trading and Expiration Cycles
</UL>

<P>
<P>
Because of their flexibility, options can provide investors with
a chance to realize almost any strategic goal, from managing risk to enhancing
leverage. Unfortunately, options can be very risky. Before investing in options, it's important to understand the strategies you can use to limit this risk.<BR>


<P>
Holders should also realize that options pay no interest or
dividends, have no voting rights, and no privileges of ownership. They are
available from Green Line on a wide variety of investment vehicles, including
stocks, bonds, gold and market indices.<BR>
<BR> While many factors have contributed to the success of exchange-traded
options in North America, standardization of key option features (including
exercise prices, trading cycles, and expiration months) is one of the most
important as it has contributed to the viability of a secondary options market.<BR>
<BR> Standardization of an option contract does not mean that all option
contracts based on a specific underlying interest are the same size. What it
does mean is that all contracts traded on a specific exchange and cleared
through a specific clearing corporation are all of the same size. Prior to the
emergence of exchange-traded options, OTC options were created on an individual
basis with terms unique to the holder and writer, and often involved odd amounts
of shares or units of the underlying interest. Standardization of contract size,
however, contributed to the growing development and popularity of
exchange-traded options.<BR>

For equity options, a 100 share (board lot) contract size
applies to all markets except in the event of a stock split (in which case the
contracts are altered to adjust for the split).
<BR>
<BR> For index options, which are cash-settled, the contract size is determined
by multiplying the premium by an index multiplier, which is usually $100.<BR>
<BR> As for standard expirations, it's important to understand that each option
class (which are options listed on the same underlying interest) has several
different option series, which are identified as calls or puts by their symbol,
expiration month, and strike price. All option series with the same expiration
month have the same expiration date and expiration time.<BR>
<BR> For example, exchange-traded equity, index and most debt options expire on
the Saturday immediately following the third Friday of the expiration month.<BR>

Depending on whether you are a holder or writer, the reasons for
investing in options could include the following:
<BR>


<P>
Leverage: For call holders, you can benefit from an increase in
the market value of the underlying security over the lifetime of the option at a
cost which is far less than the cost of buying the stock outright. You can also
use the cost savings to invest in short-term fixed-income securities, thereby
earning an immediate return on your investment.<BR>
<BR> Limited Risk: If the price of the underlying security falls instead of
rises, a call holder's maximum loss will be limited to the premium he or she
paid for the option, plus any transaction or commission costs.<BR>
<BR> To Fix a Future Price: For call holders, options allow you to fix the
future price of the underlying interest so you can fund your purchase out of
future cash flow. For put writers, locking-in a cost that is below market value
can give you the opportunity to acquire the underlying interest at a fixed cost
if the option is exercised.
<BR>
<BR> Diversification: Investors can hold calls on several underlying interests
to diversify their opportunities for capital gain. That way, the call holder has
a better chance of profiting, even if the underlying interests fail to rise on
some of his or her calls.
<BR>
<BR> Insurance Against Market Drops: An investor who expects short term
declines in a specific interest or market can hold a put on it and then sell the
put at a profit or exercise it in the event of a drop in price. A similar
strategy for protecting against price drops is to sell calls on the underlying.<BR>
<BR> Additional Income: Writers of puts and calls benefit from income received
as a premium, which becomes pure profit if the option is never exercised.<BR>

<P>
Most investors are probably familiar with Equity Options, where the
underlying interests are shares of a corporation. What you may not realize is it was the rapid success of equity options that led to the creation of non-equity options. Listed puts and calls are now available on all sorts of underlying interests, including indices and debt instruments. We're going to examine the three most popular non-equity options, which are index options, bond options, and precious metal options.<BR>

<P>
The basic differences between equity and non-equity options are
that some non-equity options are cash settled, while all equity options allow
physical delivery settlement of the underlying shares. Similarly, some
non-equity options have a European exercise style, which means they can only be
exercised on their expiration date. Most equity options, on the other hand, are
American style, which means they can be exercised on any trading day prior to
their expiration date. Finally, the minimum margin requirements for equity and
non-equity options are generally different.<BR>
<BR> Index Options are the most popular non-equity options, especially because
their low cost allows investors a very broad market exposure. Despite that,
investors should be aware of certain index option characteristics. First, the
component stocks of an underlying index are an important strategic
consideration. For investors looking to participate in the overall market, you
should choose an index with well-balanced underlying equities, not one heavily
weighted in only one or two industries. Second, investors who are looking for a
hedging strategy should find an index that has equities closely resembling their
portfolio holdings.<BR>


<P>
Bond or Debt Options are also popular investment alternatives
because they allow retail investors to participate in a market that was
previously out of reach in terms of cost and trading potential. Investing in
Government of Canada bond options gives investors the opportunity to participate
in the bond market without incurring unacceptable levels of risk.<BR>
<BR> Bond option strategies are generally used by investors to profit from (or
hedge against) changes in interest rates. If your objective is to profit from a
decline in interest rates, you would hold bond calls or write bond puts.
Conversely, if you wanted to profit from a rise in rates, you would hold bond
puts or write bond calls. If you're using bond options to hedge against changes
in interest rates, you should realize that you can't achieve a perfect hedge
unless the underlying interest being hedged is exactly the same as the
underlying of the put contract.<BR>
<BR> Finally, Precious Metal Options are options where the underlying interest
is generally gold. These options aren't as popular as the other types,
especially because the price of the underlying interest tends to be more
volatile and cyclical. You would be more likely to use precious metal options if
you wanted to hedge against fluctuations in the price of an underlying metal
that you own, or if you wanted to profit from anticipated changes in the price
of the underlying. Of course, adopting a purely profit-oriented approach is
considered speculative, and could be quite risky.
<BR>
<BR> Although Green Line can facilitate options trading in Canadian and US
stocks, bonds, most market indices, and gold, we do not arrange options on
futures contracts or currencies.<BR>

<P>
Many investors steer clear of options trading because they are
unfamiliar with the mechanics involved or are concerned about risk. Indeed, a
high degree of risk may be involved in the purchase and sale of options,
depending on how and why options are used.<BR>

<P>
It is for this reason that you should understand the different
options trading strategies available, as well as the different types of risk you
may be exposed to. While the rewards of option trading often outweigh the risks,
there are several risks you should be aware of:<BR>
<BR> Options have only a limited life. Because of that, option holders run the
risk of losing their entire investment in a relatively short period of time.<BR>
<BR> For option writers, the risks are even greater. Many people who write
calls are uncovered, which means they don't own the underlying interest. Call
writers can incur large losses if the price of the underlying interest rises
above the exercise price, forcing them to buy the interest at a high market
price but sell it for much lower.<BR>
<BR> Similarly, put writers who don't protect themselves by selling a short
position in the underlying interest may suffer a loss if the price of the
underlying interest falls below the option's exercise price. In such a
situation, the put writer will have to buy the underlying interest at a price
above current market value, thereby incurring a loss. <BR>
<BR>


<P>
When trading in US options, the transactions are often carried
out in US dollars which would expose you to risks from fluctuations in the
foreign exchange market. Furthermore, transactions that involve holding and
writing multiple options in combination, or holding and writing options in
combination with buying or selling short on the underlying interests present
additional risks.<BR>

<LI>If Trading is Interrupted
</UL>
<P>

<P>
In addition to the risks just described which apply generally to
the holding and writing of options, there are additional risks unique to trading in index options.<BR>

<P>
Because the exercise of index options is settled in cash,
writers can't cover their potential settlement obligation in advance as it may
be impossible to replicate the necessary offsetting position using the
underlying index.<BR>
<BR> Investors with spread positions and certain other multiple option
strategies are also exposed to a timing risk with index options. That's because
there is generally a one-day time lag between the time that a holder exercises
the option and a writer gets notice of an exercise assignment. Index option
writers are required to pay cash based on the closing index value on the
exercise date, not on the assignment date. Admittedly, this risk is somewhat
alleviated by the use of European-style options. <BR>
<BR> As we discussed earlier, investors intending to use index options to hedge
against the market risk associated with investing in one or more individual
stocks should recognize that this results in a very imperfect hedge. Unless the
underlying index closely matches an investor's portfolio, it may not serve to
protect against market declines at all. <BR>
<BR> Finally, if trading is interrupted in stocks that account for a
substantial portion of the value of an index, the trading of options on that
index will ordinarily be halted. If this happens, index option investors may be
unable to close out their positions and could face substantial losses if the
underlying index moves adversely before trading resumes.<BR>

<P>

<P>
By making yourself familiar with the factors influencing option
prices, you will be able to make informed decisions about which option
investment strategies will work for you.<BR>
<P>
The relationship between the market price of the underlying
interest and the exercise price of the option is a major determinant of the
option price. For example, assume ABCD shares were trading at $30, ABCD Apr 25
calls would have an Intrinsic Value of $5 per share (which is equal to their
in-the-money amount). Conversely, if ABCD stock was trading at $20, ABCD Apr 25
puts would have an intrinsic value of $5 per share. All else being equal,
options that have an intrinsic value are clearly worth more than options that
are at-the-money or out-of-the-money.<BR>
<BR> An option's Time Value is equal to its current premium minus the
in-the-money amount. As an example, let's assume ABCD stock was trading at $30
and you buy one ABCD Apr 25 call for $6. As we just saw, your call would have an
intrinsic value of $5, and its time value would be $1 (premium - intrinsic
value). Time value relates solely to the call holder's belief that the market
price of the underlying interest will rise, or to the put holder's belief that
the market price of the underlying interest will decline, before the option
expires. Normally, option holders will pay a higher time value when the
expiration date is a long time away. However, as the expiration date approaches
the time value is constantly being eroded and eventually declines to zero on the
expiration date.<BR>


<P>
The Volatility of the underlying interest's market price also
affects the price of the option. Options on an underlying interest whose market
price fluctuates widely over the short term command high premiums because option
holders have a higher possibility of profiting from their investment. However,
options on less volatile underlying interests will command lower premiums.<BR>
<BR> Finally, investors should understand the concept of Put / Call Parity when
determining the relative price of options. This concept states that if you buy a
stock, buy a put, and sell a call with the same strike price and expiration
date, you should receive the same rate of return as a Treasury Bill with the
same maturity. If this relationship does not hold, an arbitrage opportunity
exists, which generally means that the option is not optimally priced.
<BR>
<BR> Since the options market was established, several models have been
proposed to help investors determine the optimal pricing of an option. The model
used most frequently is called the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model, which
takes several key factors into account, including the risk-free rate, remaining
time to expiry, the option's strike price, the market price of the underlying,
and volatility.
<BR>


<P>
One of the benefits from the Black-Scholes Model is the
determination of an option's Delta or its Hedge Ratio. The Delta is a
sensitivity measure that indicates how much the price of an option is expected
to change, given short-term price movement in the underlying interest. The more
intrinsic value there is in an option's premium, the higher an option's delta
will be. It is, however, important to note that an option's delta is not a
static number and is only accurate at the moment of its calculation. <BR>
<BR> Other sensitivity measures include the Gamma, which measures the rate of
change in an option's Delta given a change in the underlying's market price.<BR>
<BR> The Rho is the rate of change in an option's price to a change in interest
rates. An increase in interest rates increases the market price of a call and
decreases the price of a put. This sensitivity increases as the option goes
deeper into the money. The time to expiration also affects the sensitivity of
the Rho -- it is more sensitive the longer the time to expiry.<BR>
<BR> An option's Vega or Kappa is the rate of change of an option's price to
the volatility in the market price of the underlying interest. The vega
measurement is the same for puts and calls, and is at its most sensitive when an
option is close to or at-the-money. Sensitivity is also increased when the
option is long-term.<BR>
<BR> Finally, the Theta measure describes an option's change in value as the
option gets closer to expiry. As the option gets closer to expiry, the theta 
rises dramatically, indicating a decay in value.<BR>

<P>
Despite the risks associated with options trading, there are
ways to manage the risk. Aside from understanding the factors influencing option
prices, it's also important to familiarize yourself with certain basic
strategies you can use to reduce your downside risk or decrease the volatility
of your portfolio.<BR>


<P>
As mentioned earlier, a major risk of option trading arises when
you write uncovered options. One way to minimize this type of risk is by writing
&quot;Covered Calls&quot;, which are calls against an underlying interest that
you already own.<BR>
<BR> If we look at just equity options, you would generally write covered calls
against your own stock if you expect the share price to decline in the short
term, or if you don't anticipate an advance in the share price and hope to gain
some additional income.<BR>
<BR> For example, let's say you own ABCD stock currently trading at $25 and you
write a call with a $25 strike price with a $5 premium. If the stock price drops
to $20, your entire loss on the investment will be covered by your premium. Of
course, if the stock drops below $20, you will still suffer any loss beyond
that. The downside of this strategy is that, if ABCD stock rises above $25 and
the option holder exercises the option, you will be limited to receiving only
$25 per share plus your premium.<BR>


<P>
Another way to manage the risk of a long stock position is by
holding &quot;Protective Puts&quot;, which are puts against stocks you already
own. You would hold a protective put if you wanted to maintain your exposure to
the upside of your stock while protecting yourself completely against a possible
decline in price. If you hold a protective put, the stock can decline to zero
during the term of the contract and you'll lose nothing but the premium you paid
for the put contract.<BR>
<BR> For example, if you own ABCD stock when it's trading at $25 and you're
worried about a short-term correction, you may be able to buy a put with a $25
strike price at a cost of $4 per share. If the stock drops to zero, you've
protected yourself against the decline except for the $4 premium. If the stock
rises to $45 you will enjoy the benefit of that rise, minus the $4 premium you
paid.<BR>
<BR> Another strategy for minimizing portfolio risk is to hold &quot;Index Puts&quot;.
You would hold index puts if you wanted to protect your portfolio from possible
price declines, but you weren't willing to sell the securities or incur the cost
of holding several individual put contracts.<BR>
<BR> Index puts give you the right to sell a given index at a fixed exercise
price. If share prices decline, your portfolio losses should be approximately
offset by a corresponding gain from the sale or exercise of your index puts. If
share prices advance, your stock portfolio should increase in value while the
put options expire worthless.<BR>
<BR> The efficiency of this type of hedge depends on how representative your
portfolio is to a given index. If you're only holding a few stocks, or if you're
only concerned about a few stocks in a broad portfolio, it may make more sense
to purchase individual put contracts against each stock.<BR>
<BR>  Finally, you can hedge against a short position by holding &quot;Protective
Calls&quot;. For example, if you short sell 100 DCBA shares at $30, you can buy
one DCBA Apr 30 call at a premium of, say, $4. That way, if you are forced to
buy DCBA shares to cover your short position, you can exercise your call at $30,
resulting in a loss equal only to the premium you paid (which is $4 per share
here).

<BR>
By now it should be fairly apparent that listed options satisfy
investment objectives ranging from a reasonably conservative approach to
outright speculation. Because of the complexity and volatile nature of option
markets, it is important for all investors to understand both the risks
associated with option trading, and the various strategies employed.<BR>
<BR> As was already shown, the best way to minimize risk when trading in
options is by adopting a conservative investment approach. This means you, as
the investor, should avoid uncovered writing and concentrate on writing covered
call options or holding protective puts, index puts, or protective calls to
simply manage the volatility of your existing portfolio.<BR>
<BR> However, for more experienced investors, more speculative investment
approaches can be considered. These approaches range from common tactics like
simply holding calls and puts, to moderately speculative tactics like spreading
and straddling, to outright risky tactics like uncovered writing.<BR>
<BR> For the purposes of this presentation, we've already examined the
conservative approaches to investing and will now spend some time looking over
some moderately speculative investment strategies.
<BR>


<BR><BR><HR><A NAME="Long1">&nbsp;</A><BR>
<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Long Call (Very Bullish)</FONT></B><BR>
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="gifs/longcall.gif" ALIGN=TOP BORDER="0"></CENTER>
<P>
Call holding is the most popular bullish strategy. As we already
discussed, the holder of a Long Call has the right to take delivery of the
underlying security at the exercise price within a set period of time prior to
expiration.<BR>


<P>
This strategy is most often used when the investor anticipates
that the underlying security will increase in price. The risk to this strategy
is limited to the price paid for the contract, however the reward is
theoretically unlimited because the value of the underlying security could,
theoretically, rise indefinitely.<BR>
<BR> If call premiums are too high it generally means that the market believes
the price of the stock will continue to rise. At that point, it may be
worthwhile to consider buying the stock itself.
<BR>
<BR> Because call holding is associated with short-term speculation, there is a
perception that it is a strategy in which most traders lose money. Some
statistics suggest that more than half of all options written expire worthless.
However, as with most statistical interpretations, this does not tell the whole
story. While it may be true that many call holders lose money, it does not mean
that all call holders are net losers over time. The most effective strategy is
to limit losses by closing out individual call purchases that are not working
out (even if this has to be done frequently) and to try to eventually offset
such losses with large, infrequent profits on profitable call purchases. The
successful call holder must take small losses in stride, and continue combing
the market place for a profitable underlying interest on which calls are
available.<BR>


<BR><BR><HR>

<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Long Put (Very Bearish)</FONT></B><BR>
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="gifs/longput.gif" ALIGN=TOP BORDER="0"></CENTER>
<P>
Just like call holding is the most popular bullish strategy, put
holding is the most popular bearish option strategy. It is simple to understand
and it offers an attractive risk/reward ratio. However, for a put holder to
profit, the market price of the underlying interest must decline sufficiently to recoup the put premium and commission.<BR>


<P>
A put holder must keep in mind that as time passes, any time
value in the put premium will waste away. Of course, the attraction of a put
purchase is that occasionally put holders make many times their original
investment in a very short period of time if the market price of the underlying
falls dramatically. And in the worst case scenario, the most the put holder can
lose is the premium paid.<BR>
<BR> There are generally two types of investors who hold puts. First, there are
speculators whose goal is to profit from a decline in the market price of the
underlying. Second, there are conservative investors who hold puts to hedge a
long position in an underlying interest. While both strategies have merit, they
address the needs of investors at different ends of the risk spectrum. The
strategy that fits the needs of a speculator will probably have no place in the
portfolio of a long term investor. Despite that, all put holders should look for
the best combination of time remaining to expiration and liquidity of the
selected put.<BR>
<BR> For investors trying to decide whether to hold puts or sell short, there
are certain advantages and disadvantages to each strategy. The advantages of put
holding is that margin deposits aren't needed, there is no need to make good any
dividends paid on the shorted shares, you can never be forced to exercise and
sell the underlying interest, and your loss is limited to the premium paid.
Disadvantages include the facts that puts have finite life, and they may not be
price sensitive to small declines in the underlying's market price (unless price
drops below premium paid, no profit is realized).

<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="gifs/shortcall.gif" ALIGN=TOP BORDER="0"></CENTER>
<P>
When an investor writes a call without owning the underlying
interest, he or she has sold a uncovered, or naked call.<BR>


<P>
If the market price of the underlying interest declines below
the call's strike price, the Naked Call writer will not be assigned and the
premium will be retained intact. This is why Naked Call writing is a bearish
strategy. As the expiration of the call approaches, the option's time value is
likely to decay. This works to the advantage of the Call writer because it
results in a profit even if the market price of the underlying remains unchanged
rather than declines.<BR>
<BR> If, however, the market price of the underlying rises above the call's
strike price, the call writer may lose money if the call is exercised. On being
assigned, the Naked Call writer will have to buy the underlying at the higher
market price and deliver it for the lower strike price. If the market price
continues to rise, the calls will require more margin from the writer and the
eventual loss can be substantial.<BR>


<P>
In fact, theoretically the value of the underlying security can
rise indefinitely, so Naked Call writers are exposed to a theoretically
unlimited risk. Of course, in reality, built-in practical constraints to the
trading system make unlimited loss very unlikely. If the market price of an
underlying interest started rising without interruption, the Naked Call writer
would ultimately be unable to meet margin calls, which would force the position
to be closed out and the calls bought back. Furthermore, most Naked Call writers
adopt a mental &quot;stop loss&quot; point to contain exposure. An appropriate
point is when the market price rises to an amount equal to the strike price plus
the premium received.<BR>
<BR> Because the risks assumed by Naked Call writers are enormous, and the
potential reward is limited to the premium received, you would generally only
write a Naked Call when premiums are very high.<BR>

<P>
An investor who writes an Uncovered or Naked Put is obligated to
buy the underlying interest at the put's strike price if the put is exercised.<BR>


<P>
Using the above example, an investor would write this type of
ABCD put if he or she believed that it is unlikely for the ABCD stock price to
decline, and that it is worth the risk of being obligated to buy the stock at
$20 in view of the $0.25 premium received.<BR>
<BR> Because of the limited nature of the reward, this strategy should only be
used when you do not expect the price of the underlying security to fall below
the strike price during the term of the contract. Like any type of short
selling, this strategy has a high degree of risk since the writer will have to
pay $20 for the ABCD shares even if they fall to zero. For this reason, a mental
&quot;stop loss&quot; point should be used to contain exposure. An appropriate
point to cover your short position would be when the market value of the stock
falls to the strike price minus the premium received.<BR>
<BR> As with writing naked calls, the writer of a Naked Put should generally
only consider this strategy if premiums are very high. In fact, many investors
are uncomfortable with the concept of Naked Put writing, especially after the
strategy gained unfavourable notoriety following the October, 1987 stock market
crash. At that time, many Naked Put writers incurred huge losses, causing some
to conclude that naked put writing is not a suitable strategy for conservative
investors. However, if naked put writing is done on a cash-secured basis, the
strategy has similar risk/reward characteristics to covered call writing. The
1987 stock index put losses were caused by a combination of extreme volatility
in market indices, poorly executed strategies, and overextended margin
positions, not by the strategy of writing Naked Puts.<BR>

<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Covered Call Write (Neutral)</FONT></B><BR>
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="gifs/covercall.gif" ALIGN=TOP BORDER="0"></CENTER>
<P>
For investors who are neither bearish nor bullish about various
underlying interests, there are still a good number of neutral option investment strategies you may want to consider.
<BR>


<P>
A Covered Call Write is achieved by either simultaneously buying
the underlying interest and writing equivalent calls against it, or by writing
calls against an underlying interest that you already own.<BR>
<BR> This strategy has the identical risk profile to uncovered put writing, and
 Covered Call Writing is the only way to write calls in an RRSP.<BR>
<BR> Certain situations make this strategy very attractive. Writing a covered
call against a long stock position is a good way to partially hedge against an
expected short term decline. It is not, however, an alternative to selling the
stock outright should the company's prospects sour dramatically. Covered calls
are also used for additional income when the investor does not anticipate a
decline in the underlying share price.<BR>
<BR> You shouldn't write covered calls simply because the premium is
attractive. You also shouldn't implement a Covered Call Write on an underlying
interest that you don't want to own if the option expires, or if you would be
disappointed if the call is exercised and the underlying is called away.<BR>


<P>
Because a Covered Call Writer owns the underlying interest, the
maximum risk occurs if the market price of the underlying falls to zero. In such
a case, the Covered Call Writer will have lost the value of the stock minus the
premium received. The reward is similarly limited to the difference between the
call's strike price and your net debit. To calculate your debit,  subtract the
premium you paid from the price of the stock ($22.75 here).<BR>

<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Bear Call Spread (Bearish/Neutral)</FONT></B><BR>
<CENTER><P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/bearcall.gif" ALIGN=TOP BORDER="0"></CENTER>
<P>
As mentioned earlier, Spreads are moderately speculative option
trading strategies. Basically, a spread is the purchase and sale of an equal
number of either puts or calls on the same underlying interest.<BR>


<P>
The example you see on this slide is considered a &quot;Price
Spread&quot; (also a Money or Vertical Spread), which shows the purchase and
sale of an equal number of ABCD calls with the same expiration but with
different strike prices. If the market bias on the underlying security is
bearish, you would hold a call with a higher strike price than the call you
wrote.<BR>
<BR> This strategy is useful as a limited risk alternative to uncovered call
writing. It should be used when you expect the price of the underlying security
to remain below the lower strike price through the life of each contract.<BR>
<BR> The maximum risk on a Bear Call Spread is the difference between the two
strike prices (which is $5 in this example), less the credit received. To
calculate the credit received, you look at the premium you received on the call
you sold (which is $1.25 here), and you reduce that amount by the premium you
paid on the call you bought (which is 25 cents), totalling $1. Consequently,
your maximum loss on this Bear Call Spread would be $4 per share ($5 difference
in strike price - $1 credit).<BR>
<BR> On the other hand, the maximum reward you can receive is your net credit,
or $1 per share. One note of caution is to be aware of an early assignment on
the short side.<BR>

<P>
Another strategy you may want to consider adopting in a bear
market is a Bear Put Spread. Like other price spreads, in this example you would
hold and write an equal number of ABCD puts with the same expiration but with
different strike prices.
<BR>


<P>
If the market bias on the underlying security is bearish, you
would hold a put with a higher strike price than the put you wrote. This
strategy is especially useful if premiums are too expensive to justify an
outright purchase.<BR>
<BR> With a Bear Put Spread, the maximum loss you can risk is limited to the
cost of the spread. In this example, the spread is equal to the premium cost of
the put you bought ($1.95) minus the premium you made on the put your sold (30
cents), for a total debit of $1.65 per share.<BR>
<BR> Conversely, your reward would be limited to the difference between the two
strike prices ($5) less the cost of the spread ($1.65), totalling a maximum
profit of $3.35 per share.<BR>

<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="gifs/bullcall.gif" ALIGN=TOP BORDER="0"></CENTER>
<P>
The third bullish strategy that we're going to consider is a
Bull Call Spread. This investment strategy essentially works in the opposite
direction of a Bear Call Spread. When the market bias on the underlying security
is bullish, you would hold a call with a lower strike price than the one you
wrote.<BR>


<P>
This strategy is useful when you are bullish on the underlying
security but call premiums are too expensive to justify an outright purchase. As
with similar strategies, your risk would be limited to the cost of the spread,
which in this case is $1 per share ($1.25 - 0.25).<BR>
<BR> Unfortunately, the reward of Bull Call Spreads is also capped at the
difference between the two strike prices ($5) less the cost of the spread ($1),
which in this case is $4 per share. You must also be wary of an early assignment
on the short side of the spread.<BR>

<P>
Finally, the last bullish option investment strategy we will be
considering is the Bull Put Spread. When the market bias on the underlying
security is bullish to neutral, you can hold a put with a lower strike price
than the put you wrote.<BR>


<P>
This strategy is useful as a limited risk alternative to
uncovered put writing. It should be used when you expect the price of the
underlying security to remain above the upper strike price throughout the life
of each contract.<BR>
<BR> Like similar strategies, the maximum risk of investing in Bull Put Spreads
is the difference between the two strike prices ($5) minus the credit received
($1.65), making the maximum loss in this example $3.35 per share.<BR>
<BR> Conversely, the maximum reward is limited to the net credit you receive on
the spread, which here is equal to $1.65 per share
<BR> ($1.95 - $0.30). <BR>

<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Long Combination/Straddle (Neutral-Expecting High Volatility)</FONT></B><BR>
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="gifs/longcom.gif" ALIGN=TOP BORDER="0"></CENTER>
<P>
A Long Combination is when you hold both calls and puts on the
same underlying interest with different expiry dates and/or different strike
prices. A Long Straddle is when you hold both calls and puts on the same
underlying interest, but they have the same expiry dates and strike prices.<BR>


<P>
You would hold Long Combinations or Straddles if you expected
dramatic price movement but were unsure of the direction. This uncertainty could
arise from a pending earnings announcement, litigation, etc. By holding both
calls and puts on the same underlying interest, you are effectively limiting
your loss to the premiums you pay for each contract. The reward is theoretically
unlimited on the upside (the underlying security value could rise indefinitely),
and limited to the puts strike price less the premiums paid on the downside (the
underlying security value can only fall to zero).
<BR>
<BR> With these strategies, your loss is limited to the cost of the position,
which in this example would be $1.50. Theoretically, however, you can benefit
from unlimited profit if the market price of the underlying rises or falls
dramatically before the long call expires.<BR>


<P>
The risk/reward characteristics of a long out-of-the-money
combination are similar to a long at-the-money straddle. The advantage of the
combination is the lower cost. Two out-of-the-money options are less expensive
to hold than a neutral straddle's two at-the-money options. Additionally, this
type of combination offers more leverage than a long at-the-money straddle. A
sharp move, up or down, in the underlying's market price will result in a sharp
price change in both the call and the put. The main disadvantage of such a long
combination, however, is that the options' time value component erodes quickly
as expiration approaches.<BR>


<BR><BR><HR><A NAME="Short2">&nbsp;</A><BR>
<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Short Combination/Straddle (Neutral - Expecting
Low Volatility)</FONT></B><BR>
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="gifs/shortcom.gif" ALIGN=TOP BORDER="0"></CENTER>
<P>

A Short Combination is when an investor writes both calls and
puts on the same underlying interest with different expiry dates and/or
different strike prices, while a Short Straddle is when you write both calls and
puts with the same expiry dates and strike prices.<BR>


<P>
You would use these strategies if you expect the underlying
security to trade within a tight range during the life of the contracts. The
objective is to keep the entire premium received when both the put and the call
expire worthless.<BR>
<BR> This strategy can be extremely risky since the risk is theoretically
unlimited on the upside (the underlying security value could rise indefinitely),
and limited to the puts strike price less the premiums received on the downside
(the underlying security value can only fall to zero). The reward is limited to
the premium received for both contracts or the total credit. Mental stop loss
points should be used to contain exposure. Appropriate points are the call
strike price plus both premiums (on the upside) and the put strike price minus
both premiums (on the downside). If the underlying security rises above or falls
below your stop loss points you should always close out both sides
simultaneously to avoid being whipsawed. Also, beware of early assignments.
<BR>


<P>
While straddles or combinations are bought with the hope that
the market price of the underlying interest will move significantly up or down,
a Short Straddle or Short Combination writer wants the exact opposite -- very
little market price movement in the underlying interest during the options'
lives. As long as the market price of the underlying keeps within a determined
range of the exercise price, the investor profits.<BR>
<BR> However, just like long combinations and straddles, it is generally easier
to break even on Short Combinations than it is to break even on Short Straddles.<BR>

<LI>Calendar Spreads (Time or Horizontal Spreads)
<LI>Exotic Spreads (Diagonal or Butterfly Spreads)
<LI>The Risks of Spreading
</UL>
<P>

In addition to price spreads, there are also Calendar Spreads
and Exotic Spreads.<BR>


<P>
A Calendar Spread (Time or Horizontal Spread) is the purchase
and sale of an equal number of either puts or calls on the same underlying
interest with different expirations and the same strike price. To be eligible
for spread margining, the option you hold must expire at the same time or after
the option you write.<BR>
<BR> Exotic Spreads include both Diagonal and Butterfly Spreads. A Diagonal
Spread is the purchase and sale of an equal number of either puts or calls on
the same underlying interest with different expirations and different strike
prices. To be eligible for spread margining, the option you hold must expire at
the same time or after the option you write.<BR>
<BR> Butterfly Spreads, on the other hand, involve putting on a call or put
spread with three series of calls or puts at three different strike prices on
the same underlying interest. For example, two options bought in the middle of a
Butterfly Spread at a middle strike price could be flanked by written options
having strike prices above and below the middle strike price.<BR>


<P>
Before engaging in any spreading strategies, you should
understand the  risks of spreading. Because spread orders require the execution
of both a purchase and sale transaction at or about the same time, there is no
guarantee that they will be executed. Similarly, you should recall that the
short side of the spread can be assigned at any time prior to the option's
expiry. Finally, the advantages of the spread are eliminated if the investor
liquidates the long side of the spread but remains at risk on the short side.<BR>

<UL>
<LI>Used as Non-Neutral Strategies
<LI>Require Experience, Sophistication and Sufficient Funds
</UL>
<P>

<P>
While this guide discussed the uses of combinations and
straddles as neutral strategies, there are some investors who have attempted to
put these devices into use as bearish or bullish strategies.<BR>


<P>
The acceptance of non-neutral combinations and straddles is by
no means universal. Critics are adamant that straddles and combinations are
neutral by definition, so attempting to skew them to a bearish or bullish bias
is of dubious value.<BR>
<BR> Investors generally use combinations and straddles for technical reasons.
For example, if premiums are very expensive, writing options becomes more
attractive. However, novice investors may not be able to determine when premiums
are expensive. That is why straddle and combination writing strategies usually
require experience, sophistication, and sufficient funds to carry the position.<BR>
