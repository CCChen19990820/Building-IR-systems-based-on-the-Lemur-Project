<title>Aquaculture</title>
<h1>Aquaculture</h1><p>

The aquaculture group works with the fisheries group in
addressing the research needs of the developing aquaculture
industry on a state and national level.<p>
Research is directed toward solving problems which impede the
development of the domestic aquaculture industry, including
disease control.  Closed culture system development and
controlled fish and shellfish spawning methods for successful
seed production is another priority.<p>

<title>OS Art and Nature</title>
<img src="/gcrl/mosaic/walter.gif" align=left><p>
<h1>Art and Nature</h1><p>

Ocean Springs, located on the Mississippi Sound, derives much of
its energy from art and nature - each highly dependent on the
other.<p>

This town, because of its magnificent coastal location, abounds
in natural beauty which has brought life to many talented artists
and artisans, as well as, creative architecture, floral works of
art, pottery, dance expression, stained glass, metal work, and
wildflower sculpture, all influenced profoundly by nature.<p>

Two prime examples of this coupling of art and nature are the
Walter Anderson Museum of Art and Gulf Islands National Seashore. 
The Museum, which opened in May of 1991, hosts changing
collections on loan from other museums and private collections
which are important to the contemporary art scene or significant
to art history. The East Gallery presents a changing collection
of work by Walter Ingles Anderson, the mystifying artist for whom
the Museum is named. The Museum's permanent exhibit includes
Anderson's "Creation at Sunrise" murals, the W.R.A. murals,
entitled "Ocean Springs: Past and Present", and the "Little Room"
all stemming from the majestic flora and fauna native to the
coastal region. The Museum offers its thousands of visitors an
opportunity to delve into the world of Anderson and other great
painters, sculptors, photographers and creative masters.<p>
  
Ocean Springs, also, boasts a national park, Gulf Islands
National Seashore. The mainland park located on Davis Bayou in
Ocean Springs has many year-round facilities, including a
campground, tent area, picnic shelters, nature trail, boat docks,
and the William M. Colmer Visitor Center. The barrier islands are
about 10 miles offshore and can be reached only by boat. They are
continually changing and buffer the mainland from storms. The
Gulf Island National Seashore is a park rich in cultural and
natural history and a creative haven for many artists intent on
capturing the beauty of the coastal area.<p>

<title>Biodiversity and Systematics</title>
<h1>Biodiversity and Systematics</h1><p>

The Laboratory's biodiversity group identifies and studies
various biological communities in the Gulf of Mexco, the
Caribbean, and the world's oceans so that important environmental
changes can be documented.  These studies complement GCRL's
environmental fate and effects research, because evaluations are
made of the impact of man's activities on the environment and the
effects of these changes on specific organisms.<p>

The Laboratory has several internationally recognized collections
of marine animals and plants used for the study, preservation,
and management of marine and estuarine ecosystems.  These
collections provide important baseline scientific estimates of
the rate and nature of environmental changes in the Gulf region
over the past 40 years. Since the design and behavior of all
biological systems results form a complex interdependence of all
life forms, research is dependent on accurate identifications and
detailed information on the systematic biology of the systems
involved.  GCRL's collections permit positive identification of
organisms, documentation of known geographic ranges, and study of
specimens and their important ecological roles.<p>

<title>Physical Oceanography</title>
<h1>Physical Oceanography</h1><p>

GCRL scientists study the circulation and physical
characteristics of Mississippi's coastal waters which are vital
to wise management of the marine environment and its valuable
resources.  The path and destination of pollutants as well as the
early life stages of many marine species are determined by these
currents.  A grant from the National Aeronautics nd Space
Administration provides partial support for research on tidal
fronts which have a profound effect on animal migration.  Data
collected will enable more accurate forecasting of fishery
resources.  A new contract form the U.S. Dept.. of the Interior 
Mineral Management Service supports the analysis and synthesis of
Mississippi coastal oceanographic data.<p>

<title>Geological Projects</title>
<h1>Geological Projects</h1><p>

GCRL geologists evaluate drill samples to establish the nature of
coastal sediments, the number of past stable shoreline positions,
sea level fluctuations, and shoreline changes and development on
the mainland and coastal barrier islands.  Pre-Pleistocene
geological units of south Mississippi ar being investigated and
reevaluated.  An ongoing GCRL multi-year project in cooperation
with the U.S. Geological Survey and state geologists is preparing
coastal geological maps and detailed accounts of the geological
evolution of Mississippi and adjacent coastal regions. 
Continuing studies of certain sediments in coastal and offshore
areas in Mississippi and Alabama are expect to rectify some past
misconceptions about sediment units that include vital
groundwater and natural gas resources.  GCRL geologists continue
study of the geological development of the Pleistocene coastal
plain along the northern Gulf Coast between southwest Texas and
the Florida peninsula. They also conduct and evaluate beach
profiles on a continuous basis to document and measure changes on
Harrison County's beach.<p>
GCRL research findings are presented at many international,
national and regional meetings, workshops and professional
gatherings.  Knowledge is shared with colleagues and the public
by participation in various advisory groups and meetings.  Many
staff members are featured speakers at civic gatherings and
organizational meetings and take advantage of these opportunities
to bring their research findings out of the laboratory and the
field and into the community.<p>
Staff members have prepared and published numerous reports,
papers, guidebooks, book chapters and other publications of
local, regional, national and international significance.<p>
     Many GCRL researchers direct graduate research programs and
provide academic instruction nd assistance to individuals and
groups.  They also provide professional services to academic,

<title>Cobia Research</title>

<h1>Investigations of Cobia, <u>Rachycentron canadum</u> in
Mississippi Marine waters and adjacent Gulf of Mexico.</h1>  

<h3>James S. Franks, Principal Investigator</h3>
<hr>
     The cobia is one of the premier sport fish found in the Gulf
of Mexico. In Mississippi the cobia fishery is strictly
recreational, commercial catch and sale being prohibited.<p>

     During the last decade a great deal of concern has been
expressed by fisheries biologists and sport fishermen regarding 
the perceived decline in the numbers of cobia within the Gulf.
Answers to important biological questions are needed so that this
valuable finfish resource can be more effectively managed.<p> 

     The Gulf Coast Research Laboratory is currently conducting
research on life history aspects of cobia occurring within
Mississippi coastal waters and the adjacent Gulf of Mexico. The
study is funded by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Sport Fish
Restoration Program through the Mississippi Department of Marine
Resources. Research findings will be made available to fishery
resource managers throughout the Gulf region.<p>

Key areas of research include: age (what is the age distribution
in the fishery?), growth (what are growth rates and maximum size
per sex?), reproductive biology (what is time, location and
seasonal frequency of spawning; age at maturity?), food
requirements (what are the principal prey of cobia?), migration
patterns and routes (what are the seasons, routes and distances
of migrations?), statistics on cobia taken in the recreational
fishery, and biology and behavior of cobia maintained in culture
systems.<p> 

One aspect of the study involves the direct participation of
coastal recreational fishermen and conservation organizations (in
all Gulf states) in the study. This primarily involves: 1)
anglers allowing project personnel to examine their catch of
cobia and obtain biological samples and 2) participation of
anglers in the Cooperative Cobia Tag and Release Program managed
by GCRL cobia project staff. The very successful tag and release
program is providing data on cobia growth and seasonal
movement/migration in the Gulf of Mexico.<p>

<h3><A name="Need">The Need for Data Standardization</a></h3>
<br>
<p>One of the most important aspects of any effort to communicate is the need to clearly
convey definitions and precise meanings of the terms being used.  Definitions are especially
important in the implementation of a computer-facilitated-communication strategy essential to
dealing with the myriad of facts and records about organisms and their environment.  Despite its
importance, precise expression of ideas in the context of computer-assisted communication can
often be difficult, even for seemingly simple concepts.  When analyzed carefully, simple ideas
often involve numerous interrelated and easily overlooked nuances of meaning, each of which
must be described in a consistent and logical manner.  If an information system is to be
maximally useful, each fundamental conceptual element underlying the  information model
describing ideas the incorporated must be specified together with the precise relations among
these elements.
<br>
<p>Complex and varied kinds of data must be modeled in the design and implementation of
information storage and retrieval mechanisms, if such mechanisms are to  be used to conduct
viable research, education, and management strategies for these species.  To develop the
complex communication systems that will be necessary to archive, study, and utilize information
about potentially endangered species in the Gulf of Mexico, both discipline-wide and
interdisciplinary standards are required.  Such standards become increasingly important as
distributed systems are designed for simultaneous use by a wide variety of investigators, each
pursuing numerous aspects of information about these species.  Some scientists will work in a
highly collaborative fashion, others will pursue more narrowly focused, but no less critical 
objectives, and many will undertake such work at numerous sites or levels within the system. 
Careful thought about the fundamental nature of the data and standardization of these concepts
are essential, if such a system is to be manageable.
<br>
<p>With respect to collections records of potentially endangered species in the Gulf of Mexico,
an understanding of the quality and scope of these data are essential to documenting  potential
changes in the distribution and biology of these organisms.  Such archives contain the sole
existing vouchers documenting the presence of these species at specific localities at times before
human impact that may significantly altered their natural range.  Such archives also serve to
establish the scientific conventions of names used to refer to these species.
<br>
<p>Without materials for comparison, confirmation of taxonomic identifications can seldom be
made with a reasonable degree of certainty.  For the vast majority of organisms, there are few or
no experts.  Even when experts exist, certain museum specimens called <a href="/gcrl/index.html"></a> type
specimens play the epistemological essential role of defining the relation between actual
organisms, the taxonomy used to refer to these organisms, and the information and ideas that
scientists have about them.  Without reference specimens, scientific nomenclature is either
undefined or unstable, and without a stable nomenclature, we can not speak knowledgeably
about the biology of any species.  
<br>
<p>Although we seek to gain and utilize information about these species for a variety of
purposes, it is essential to understand that for most rare or poorly known species, it is not the
information that may currently be contained in our databases on a given day that forms the
ultimate basis of efforts to model and standardize information about species.  Rather, it is the
reference specimens themselves that provide the ultimate basis of scientific hypotheses about
particular species.  Databases can never eliminate the need for archival material, because such
materials are essential to formulation of scientific hypotheses about species.  Without reference
specimens we have no basis for comparison.  The quality of the science conducted is good only
to the extent that we are able to distinguish the truth or falsity of the many hypotheses or ideas
we may have about these specimens and inferentially the other individuals of the species they
define.  Because of the necessary link between taxonomy and scientific knowledge about
potentially endangered species, which viewed in the perspective of  geological time may
encompass virtually all <URL to tree of life page on metazoa, metazoan> species,
standardization efforts must begin with fundamental aspects of collections data. 
<br>
<br>
<A name="Properties"></a><h3>Properties of Information Relevant to the Identification of
Potentially Endangered Species.</h3>
<br>
<p>Although numerous databases and other sources of information about potentially
endangered species and their habitats have been developed, the degree of standardization and
relatedness that exists among these data sources remain limited.   In numerous cases existing
standards are contradictory.  In many more instances the information necessary to relate a data
elements among databases is incomplete.  If the nature of unknown or incomplete information is
to be fully understood, particular attention must be paid to the fundamental properties of the
various kinds of data that are believed to be known.  Extension by inference from properties or
relations among data elements and the discovery of logical inconsistency are fundamental to the
scientific method.  Thus, the means to add data, discover error, and make predictions must form 
a fundamental part of the design of a scientifically useful information system.<p>
<br>
<A name="Limits"></a><h3>Existing Information and the Limits of Current Standards.</h3>
<br>
<pr>For collections data there exist a variety of  alternate approaches that have been taken to
maintain information about the scientific name, locality of capture, and time and method of
collection.   The multiple levels of  taxonomic rank, the hierarchy of group names that are
thought to reflect the relative recency of common ancestry of the include organisms, have yet to
be fully standardized.  This is in large measure due to the complexity of determining the
propinquity of descent and the multiplicity of ranks and names that ensue from efforts to
establish phylogenies.  Nonetheless, there is near universal agreement concerning the ranks of
genus and species, both of which must be both present for the purposes of the binomial Linnean
systems of nomenclature.  Two such systems exist, one for animals and one for plants, with
special conventions applied to microorganisms.  It is usually the case that collections
electronically store these ranks separately, although some collections may treat both as a single
data element.  The measure of completeness in specification of higher or lower taxonomic ranks 
varies greatly.  
<br>For fish collections, the family group name is often associated with individual records,
whereas the ordinal names are less likely to be associated.  The <a href ="/gcrl/index.html">California Academy
of Sciences</a> has developed a comprehensive database of the generic names of fishes as part
of its "<a href ="/gcrl/index.html">Genera of Fishes Project</a>.   Subfamilial or tribal ranks, common in other
taxa such as insects,  are seldom employed.  The names of subspecies are often but not
universally recorded, in part because of the considerable difficulty in characterizing features 
that may be used to establish intraspecific differentiation.  Naming conventions for hybrid
species may be the most extreme examples of the problems that can arise in recognizing
subspecific ranks.  For a few collections these names may be tied to the authors who originally
proposed the names, when the species were first discovered and  in the most completely
documented collection records,  these works are associated with the date of original publication. 
This date is important, since rules of priority determine which of multiple names for a species
will be used for a given species.   However, the International Codes of Zoological Nomenclature
apply only to taxon names of generic, specific, and subspecific ranks.
<br>
<p>Unquestionably, the representation of information about the locality of capture, is the least
standardized kind of data associated with collection records.   For early records it is often vague,
incomplete, or may refer to place names no longer in use.  Available information may be given
exactly as specified from original sources, such as field notes, made at the time the organism was
captured or may be representations of this information recorded at a later time by workers
interpreting such information and parsing it into separate data elements, such as political or
geographic subdivisions (ie. Jackson Co., Mississippi or the Gulf of Mexico).  While political
boundaries can be usually be precisely described, even though they can change in position and
name with time, geographic subdivisions often can not be so readily specified.  Although the
concepts of latitude and longitude were in large measure developed to avoid the uncertainty of
qualitative classifications of place names, often such data are not uniformly recorded.  Degrees,
minutes, seconds, may be treated in different fields or combined into a single data element.  New
technologies such as global positioning satellites have added alternate decimal specifications, as
well as increased precision.  Because many localities are described via reference to other place
names (i.e. "3 miles upstream of the mouth of the Pearl River"), it is difficult to translate from
one reference system to the other.  For certain kinds of locality data, such as field number or
station numbers may not be uniformly used among or even within collections.  For fish
collections, the discrepancies may be due to differences associated with the way the specimens
were taken.  Locality data for marine collections often include vessel, station, cruise, haul or tow
information as well as a range of positions associated with how long certain kinds of gears, most
notably trawls, were employed.   Freshwater collections often refer to station or field numbers to
specify the location of capture.  Standards for specifying such disparate data have been seldom
explicitly modeled and are often influenced by the composition of the collection, which may or
may not reflect the sampling bias observed in other collections.
<br>
<br>
<A name="Current"></a><h3>Current Standardization Efforts Within the Museums
Community.</h3>
<br>
<p>To date no single reference or data source contains a comprehensive listing of institutions
housing natural history materials for all organisms.  Such collections are widely scattered and
few taxonomic disciplines have compiled lists of institutions containing archived materials.  
However, one such list does exist for fishes, <a href="leviton.html">Leviton,
Gibbs, Heal, and Dawson, 1985</a> and it has received wide use in other disciplines as well. 
Because many collections records for fishes have been computerized, efforts to access and
analyze the potential usefulness of historically collected materials have initially focused on
fishes.  This work has been assembled into a <a href='/gcrl/asih/asih_codes.html'>database</a> of institutional symbolic codes
maintained by the <a href='/gcrl/asih/asih_home.html'>American Society of Ichthyology and Herpetology</a>
, through the activities of its collections committee.  Efforts continue to
standardize institutional symbolic codes in use by all disciplines.
<br>
<p>Interdisciplinary standards do not yet exist, but are emerging.  <a href> The Association for
Systematics Collections (ASC)</a> has developed a general information
model (<a href=/gcrl/index.html>ASC Committee on Computerization
 and Network Committee, 1993</a>).   The
Museum of Vertebrate Zoology of the University of California at Berkeley has developed a
more comprehensive model for use in managing information relating to their
collections across multiple disciplines (<a HREF="/gcrl/index.html">Bloom, 1995</a>).  The ASIH is presently
developing a discipline-wide data standard and a draft model based upon these standard models
to represent collections data.  
<br>
<br>
<A name="Specifics"></a><h3>Data Standards Specific to the Identification of Potentially
Endangered Species Workshop</h3><p>
<br>
<p>The <a href='/gcrl/asih/data_stan/diagrams/index.html'>draft standard</a> of the American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists  (ASIH) 
is being used to characterize collections records of potentially endangered
species in the Gulf of Mexico.  Information models employed in the Workshop to Identify
Potentially Endangered Species in the Gulf of Mexico have been developed using object role
modeling methodology.  This methodology is particularly useful in permitting conceptual issues
to be clarified and discussed without confusing discussion at this level with those associated with
their implementation on a particular hardware platform or software environment. <a href="/gcrl/index.html"> General
information</a> about object role modeling is available.  These models have permitted us to work toward a well-defined implementation of
the basic concepts associated with collections records and to lay the ground work for the
specification of related information about potentially endangered species.
<br>
<br>
<A name="Use"></a><h3>Use of Standardized Information Developed for the Workshop on
Endangered Species</h3>
<p>Potential users of such information should note that standardization efforts presently focus
simple relations among a limited number of these data elements for collection records currently
available from archive collections.  Standards are not immutable and fixed.  Rather, they will
evolve as consensus is reached both within and among scientific disciplines about the adequacy
of  the manner fundamental data elements represent the reality scientists seek to study.  Like
organisms, standards that are most useful, stable, and widely adopted tend to replace, less
predictive, more unstable representations.
<br>
<p>The user should also recognize that collections are continually adding specimens and records
as the search for knowledge about all organisms continues.  Records available in the database
created for use in the Workshop on the Identification of Potentially Endangered Species in the
Gulf of Mexico may only be a subset of the records now available at  institutions that have
shared such records.  Comprehensive lists of available collections records should be sought from
the appropriate depository.  The compilation of databases of collections records available to the
Workshop are not meant to duplicate the efforts of these institutions.   The purpose of
maintaining a common database to more readily permit these records to be utilized in the context
of the identification of potentially endangered species in the Gulf of Mexico.  Organization,
analysis, and the association of non-collections data to such records is meant to facilitate the
study of such species and to assist these institutions, the EPA, and other parties in collectively
making increased use of this information for research, educational, and management purposes.
<br>
<p>Likewise, the user should also note that collections data associated specific records can not
be used uncritically.  Many records are based on incorrect identifications and may contain
erroneous or missing information.  Correction of such errors or the addition of information from
other available sources often requires considerable taxonomic expertise and  the availability of
original collections records.  It is labor intensive to prepare and manage these records, and hence
costly.  Users discovering errors or having questions about specific records should address them
to appropriate personnel at the appropriate depository institution.  Users should, however, be
cognizant that these non-profit or governmental institutions may not have sufficient resources to
respond to all such requests.

<p>Users are further advised to note that individual collections records are copyrighted
information.   However, because the mission of many of these institutions is in large measure to
make this kind of information readily available and because public funds have often been
received in the procurement and computerization of such data, this information may almost
universally be freely disseminated, so long as the original source of the data is acknowledged.
Users interested in dissemination of these data for other purposes may be in violation of  U.S.
copyright laws.

<title>Education</title>
<h1>Education</h1><p>

The Ocean Springs School District encompasses all areas inside
the Ocean Springs city limits and certain areas outside the city
limits. Approximately 2,300 children in grades K through 5 are
taught in three elementary schoolswith all 6th grade students
attending N.E. Taconi Elementary. Grades 7 through 9 attend the
Ocean Springs Junior High School and grades 10 through 12 attend
Ocean Springs High School. Many students taking vocational
courses attend the E. H. Keys Vocational-Technical Center.
Enrollment at the Junior High is approximately 1,100 students and
there are roughly 960 students at the Senior High.<p>

All schools in the district are fully accredited by the
Mississippi Accrediting Commission and the Southern Association
of Colleges and Schools. During the 1993-1994 school year; Ocean
Springs was recognized as one of two school districts in the
state who had earned the distinction of a Level 5 District. In
1992-93, Ocean Springs seniors held an average ACT composite
score of 22.1 which is above the 20.7 national average. Seniors
from Ocean Springs who completed the recommended core curriculum
for college preparation held an average ACT composite of 22.6.
These scores represent approximately 75% of the senior class.
District norms on the ACT, as well as the Stanford Achievement
Test administered ingrades K-8, are traditionally well above
state and national norms. Eleven and one half percent of the 
1993 seniors held a 28 ACT composite score or above. Three
1993-94 seniors designated as National Merit Semifinalist have
gone on to finalist status. This distinction places them in a
group representing fewer than half of one percent of American
high school seniors and one to two and one half percent of Ocean
Springs High School seniors. Ocean Springs High School has had an
average of five National Merit Finalist each year for the past
twelve years.<p>

Ocean Springs High School offers a full complement of Advanced
Placement courses from calculus to English, as well as a junior
high gifted and talented program. The study of French, Spanish,
algebra, and word processing can begin as early as the eighth
grade. A comprehensive health education course is required for
all junior high students. Band, choral music, art, computer
science,and a successful sports program bring variety and
challenge to the students of this district.<p>

A modern vocational technical facility prepares students for
immediate post-secondary employment or provides preliminary
preparation for entrance into technical schools and university
course work. Diversified Technology provides opportunities for
future engineers and scientists to study robotics, electronics,
computers, and other high tech areas on state-of-the-art
equipment. Other areas such as Child Care and Marine Mechanics
supply adequate training for employment after high school
graduation or provide a basis for further post-secondary
study.<p>

The mission of the Ocean Springs School District is "to provide
an educational environment in which the students have the
opportunity to achieve academic success, to develop physical and
emotional well-being,and to become responsible citizens." Ocean
Springs Junior High fulfills this mission by offering a wide
variety of academic courses and extracurricular activities.
Because junior high age students are beginning to shape both
their identities and their futures, the junior high offers a
large number of one semester and full year courses which give
students the opportunity to try many different things. Academic
courses include foreign languages and advanced or honors classes
in addition to regular classes. Vocational classes in industrial
arts and home economics as well as computer applications and ROTC
offer career preparation.<p>

A study skills course helps students to become independent
learners. Skills for Adolescence is a positive youth development
and drug prevention program that brings students together with
parents, educators, and members of the community. Physical
education classes provide opportunities to learn hunter safety
and boating and water safety in addition to sports and exercise
programs. The Special Education Department provides inclusion
classes, tutorial sessions and resource classes. Gifted and
Talented classes are available in the areas of English, Mind and
Body and Humanities. A wide variety of clubs and sports are
offered to meet the needs of the students.<p>  

All four elementary schools (three K-5 and one 6th grade school)
offer acomprehensive developmental curriculum with emphasis on
basic skills mastery and child-centered learning.The average
number of students in a regular elementary classroom is currently
26. Each elementary school is equipped with thirty station
computer labs to enhance traditional learning methods with
computer assisted instruction. The three K-5 elementary schools
utilize an integrated learning software system from
Jostens/Education Systems Corporation with IBM PC network. An IBM
networked laboratory at the sixth grade school provides an
extensive variety of skill and drill, personal values development
and writing/thinking software. DARE and TOO GOOD FOR DRUGS, two
nationally popular drug education programs, are also provided for
fifth and sixth graders. Art, music, physical education, and drug
education are provided for all elementary students. In addition,
beginners band is offered to sixth graders, while the K through 5
schools teach swimming to third graders through a cooperative
agreement with the local YMCA.<p>  

Students with special needs will find services tailored to meet
their demands. Programs are provided for sight, hearing, and
speech impaired,educable mentally retarded, trainable mentally
retarded, learning disabled, and emotionally disturbed students.
"Project Springboard", an elementary gifted and talented program,
has been highly successful in motivating high-scoring
youngsters.<p>

Elementary children who live one half mile and secondary students
who live one mile or more from the school they attend, are
transported to and from school. Bus schedules are available at
the individual schools.<p> 

Students receive report cards at the end of each nine week
period. Progress reports are issued to all students during the
fifth week of the grading period.<p>

<title>Why use Fish for Cancer Research?</title>
<h1>Why use Fish for Cancer Research?</h1><p>

Studies with small fish are favored to augment those which use
rodents to better understand chemical carcinogenic mechanisms and
processesses.  Small fish are useful because of their hardiness,
disease resistance, ease of maintenance and exposure, and the
relatively low cost for testing large number if identical age and
history, with relatively little hazardous waste produced.  They
are easy to breed and maintain and respond quickly to certain
carcinogens.  Whole specimens can be examined on a single glass
slide.  Also, fish in controlled environments rarely develop
cancer.<p>

<title>Environmental Assessments</title>
<h1>Environmental Assessments</h1><p>

Current GCRL projects supported by the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers, and industry are enabling researchers to
develop methods and protocols for determining if an area has been
impacted by contaminants, assessing the severity of pollution,
and establishing cause-and-effect relationships.  These
determinations by GCRL scientists are necessary for Mississippi's
regulatory agencies in controlling the use of certain chemicals
in state waters and providing state environmental managers with
tools for assessing ecosystem risk.<p>
     GCRL scientists are developing a suite of early warning
bioindicators which can be used to assess exposure to and
sublethal effects of various chemicals.  Changes in cell
membrane, DNA structures  and enzyme activities in both plants
and animals which can affect growth, reproduction, and viability
are being assessed as biomarkers for future field studies.<p>
     Chemists are identifying changes which occur in lipid
membranes of plants and animals upon exposure to toxic chemicals
which can affect an organism's health and survival. Cell membrane
degradation can be caused by free radical attack, and one the
membrane is erode, the organism is subject to various diseases. 
Antioxidants are part of the mechanism of defense against
oxidation of cell membranes, and chemists at the Laboratory are
exploring how changes in the levels of these antioxidants affect
long-health of plants or animals exposed to environmental

<h1>Workshop to identify potentially endangered species in the Gulf of Mexico and to determine research needs for these species.</h1><p>
<b>PROJECT DESCRIPTION</b>:  Identification of potentially endangered species in the Gulf of Mexico from among myriads of organisms whose distribution, abundance, taxonomy and life history parameters are often poorly known is an exceedingly difficult task.  One essential need in any scientific effort to identify such species is to have at hand a verifiable historical record of the collection of these species in the past that could be used to confirm that a given species is currently in decline.  Without use of such records it would be impossible to determine if the abundance and distribution of a particular species has changed or if it is only rare or not widely collected previously.  Reliance on published studies alone would be scientifically and legally indefensible, since without voucher materials the identifications of specimens is unverifiable and easily subject to challenge.  This is likely most true for organisms that are little encountered, poorly known, and whose taxonomy is seldom studied by most biologists.  Such  organisms are more likely to be endangered than commonly collected forms.  Archival collections also permit study of historical changes in distributions.  Fortunately for many organisms, such collections exist and are computerized in whole or part, thereby permitting this question to be asked, and in many cases readily answered.  In discussing recent extinctions of invertebrates, Carleton (1993.  Neoextinctions of  Marine Invertebrates.  American Zoologist.  33:499-509) concluded that searches for overlooked neoextinctions would fruitfully focus on using literature and museums for evidence of species reported from highly impacted, urbanized coastal habitats, saltmarshes, lagoons, seagrass communities, and supralittoral zones, habitats now largely obliterated on the coastal margins of the world.  By implication, endangered species are also likely to be found in such habitats using this technique.<p>
     It is the intent of this proposal to utilize existing archival collections as an initial step toward identifying potentially endangered species and to use these collection resources to document specific habitats and localities that are clearly in decline.  These habitats and localities may likely harbor other at-risk species whose biology is much more poorly known.  The workshop will also use other information resources that can be brought to bear on this difficult problem.  Results of these efforts will be summarized in the form of a workshop and accompanying documents, as well as presented in on-line information and database systems that will be needed to further address the status of species identified as potentially endangered or likely to be at risk in the future.  Such systems must be an integral part of efforts such as this, if a sufficiently broad segment of the public is to be provided with an awareness and understanding of the importance of such studies that provide for the maintenance of ecosystem health essential to the public welfare and the sustainability of commercial and recreational fisheries.<p>
     Archival collections containing materials collected from the Gulf of Mexico are present in several hundred museums throughout the world.  The earliest such collections for which materials are still available date back to the late eighteenth century.  However, as one might expect, the bulk of collections
are taken in the past 50 years and concentrated primarily in archival collections in the immediate vicinity of the Gulf of Mexico.  The exact number of specimens in such collections is at present difficult to determine, with those for vertebrates, particularly fishes, the best known.  Current estimates (Poss, S. G. and B. B. Collette.  1995.  Second Survey of Fish Collections in the United States and Canada. Copeia.  1995:48-70) show that about 64 million specimens of fishes exist in US and Canadian fish collections, with 74% of collections containing holdings that document environmental change.  Perhaps
3-7 million of these specimens have been collected from the Gulf of Mexico and its near coastal regions. Most specimens are present in the following collections (in order by size of holdings): Tulane University, the Florida State Museum, the Gulf Coast Research Laboratory (including that of the University of Southern Mississippi), Texas A&M University, the University of Alabama, and Northeastern Louisiana University.  The majority of these holdings are computerized, and except for the Northeastern Louisiana University collection, which contains only about 10% marine holdings, all have agreed to participate in this joint effort.<p>

    Work would involve searching these databases and other sources of information to produce preliminary lists of target species and to identify habitat types that appear in decline.  Databases of several other major fish collections, currently on-line through the FishGopher Project, would also be utilized.  In some cases sampling has been highly quantitative, such as extensive seagrass samples taken throughout the Gulf and presently in the Texas A&M collection.  These databases would likely contain other at-risk species that could be targeted for further study, particularly those dealing with invertebrates.  Invertebrates are more poorly known, since there is limited taxonomic expertise and few collections are large.  Most invertebrate collections are not yet sufficiently computerized to permit rapid assessment of their holdings.  Historical analysis of archival materials has been successfully used to document the probable extinction of eelgrass limpets from Labrador to Long Island and of diminution of Caribbean reef fish distributions (Carlton, 1993; Culotta, 1994.  Is Marine Biodiversity At Risk?  Science.  263:918-920).<p>
     Compilation of documentation and analysis of other previous attempts to determine potentially endangered marine species, such as work conducted by the New England Aquarium, the results of the recent AAAS symposium on marine biodiversity, the American Society of Zoologists symposium on  the crisis in invertebrate conservation (American Zoologist 33(6):487-630), as well as other studies that may contain data suitable to the determination of environmental changes bearing on the potential decline of individual species would also be made.  Existing fisheries databases, particularly those that evaluate
bycatch, such as that of the NOAA E-Map Initiative, will be utilized that provide some indication of previous species abundance.  However, such databases primarily target commercially important species and are likely to be too recently collected to be used to statistically differentiate historical trends from seasonal variability.  They often lack vouchers of non-game species necessary to confirm identifications typically made by biologists with limited taxonomic expertise, and utilize collecting gear that typically excludes smaller species, whose clutch sizes are small and whose dispersal ability may be limited.<p>
      Although databases including sampling of larvae exist and may provide useful information on the abundance of smaller species, most such collections have been made in areas of open-water that are most likely to contain broadly distributed species and are relatively removed from anthropogenic disturbance.  Few, if any potentially endangered species are likely to be demonstrated from plankton collections.  Such collections show extreme year-to-year variation in larval abundance.  Sampling is often biased in that it is difficult to establish comparable measures of larval abundance over long periods of time, particularly for species with non-planktonic larvae or extremely short early life-history stages.  In addition voucher specimens representing these collections are often not yet fully curated, computerized, or accurately identified.  Evaluation of such data, although potentially useful, must be considered secondary to the primary task of identification of species that can be demonstrated to be endangered, or nearly so, through analysis of historical records.<p>
     Another important source of information that bears on the identification of potentially endangered species is the historical record of aerial photography, which may be used to identify habitats such as seagrass beds, coral reefs, and heavily impacted coastal zones like those associated with harbors and industrial development.  The identity, distribution and abundance of species known to occur in these habitats can then be compared against existing archival records, incorporating data from previous ecological and fisheries studies to identify species in decline.  It is important to note that archival collections are critical to this process, since for many poorly studied species it is only through the presence of a voucher specimen that the accuracy of identifications of specimens used in previous studies could be verified.  Aerial photography as opposed to satellite imagery would be used, as the early records of the latter either lack adequate resolution or capture information in regions of the spectrum that can only resolve surface phenomena.  High-altitude aerial photography completed by the Tobin Research Institute of San Antonio, Texas in the 1940's and the USGS National Mapping Division, (headquartered at Stennis Space Center), in the late 1970's and early 1980's would be used to establish the suitability of aerial reconnaissance photography, to determine geographic coverage for identifiable microhabitats, and to provide preliminary estimates of habitat loss.  Efforts directed toward the proposed workshop and completion of summary documents would include: 1) establishment of a database of all collections of aerial photographs that could potentially be used to evaluate habitat loss or modification, 2) documentation of aerial photographs to determine issues relating to their source and availability, and 3) study of representative, readily available aerial photographs, to determine their date, suitability, extent of geographic coverage, and 4) cross-referencing with areas identified from examination of collections. Such cross-referencing would be extremely important in determining the status of species with highly restricted distributions.  Species such as the fiddler crab Uca subcylindrica, which occurs only near an abiotic region in southern Texas (Rabalais and Cameron.  1983.  J. Crustacean Biology.  3(4):519-541) that is now seasonally anoxic, the seahorse Hippocampus zostrae that is a highly-specialized inhabitant of seagrass beds with extremely limited dispersal ability, or Phyllaplysia smaragada, once relatively common but now uncollected since 1982 (Culotta, E.  1994), and species that have particularly susceptible life history stages may prove to be candidate species.  Recent mathematical extinction models suggest that habitat specialists with limited dispersal ability, are most at-risk to extinction (Tillman, 1994. Competition and biodiversity in spatially structured habitats.  Ecology.  75(1):2-16).  As pointed out by Sebens (1994.  Biodiversity of Coral Reefs: What are We Losing and Why?  American Zoologist. 34:115-133), conservation of keystone species, such as corals, within certain habitats may provide the best means of preventing large numbers of other species that live in association with these species from becoming extinct.<p>
     Dr. Daryl Felder of Western Louisiana University will lead investigations regarding identification of invertebrates in the Gulf of Mexico at-risk of extinction.  Invertebrates make up about 99% of all species (Hadfield.  1993.  Introduction to the Symposium.  The Crisis of Invertebrate Conservation. American Zoologist 33:497-498).   Unfortunately, relatively little is known of marine invertebrate biodiversity, with perhaps as little as 10-15% of the fauna as yet described (Norse, E., 1993.  Global Marine Biodiversity, Island Press.), with little prospect for significant progress because of the lack of taxonomic expertise in many groups.   Work in this project will be focused on groups known to be in decline, habitats known to be disappearing or under stress, and taxa with limited distributions that occur in regions of high anthropogenic disturbance and for which introductions of non-indigenous organisms may be contributing to declines of native species.  Although not widely appreciated, some marine environments are considerably more impacted than their terrestrial counterparts, with harbors being among the most severely threatened ecosystems on earth (Carlton, J. T. and J. B. Geller.  1993. Ecological Roulette: The Global Transport of Nonindigenous Marine Organisms.  Science, 261:78-82). Analysis of invertebrate collections will be undertaken selectively as the level of computerization of existing invertebrate archives permit, with particular attention paid to assessment of future research needs.  Additional expertise will be secured to address the status of invertebrate taxa, but the identity of
individual specialists has not been fixed at this time.  Five ichthyologists nationally recognized as familiar with the fish fauna of the Gulf of Mexico will directly participate in the analysis of data for fishes.  In addition to the P.I. these are: Dr. John McEachran, Texas A&M University; Dr. Henry Bart, Tulane
University; Dr. Richard Mayden, University of Alabama; and George Burgess, Florida State Museum.<p>
     Although efforts will be focused on fishes whose collections are largely computerized and can be more readily assessed, and on identifying potentially endangered invertebrates that occur within the Gulf of Mexico, mammalian, avian, and reptilian taxa will be evaluated as well.  While the status of species in these taxa are much better known and largely do not require additional identification, experience of experts knowledgeable in these areas will be drawn upon.  Their insight will serve to draw attention to problems that may be need to be addressed when dealing with species whose biology is likely poorly known.  Dr.  James P. Ross, Curator of Reptiles at the Florida State Museum and Institute of Sea Turtle Research will participate in the workshop to discuss issues associated with endangered hereptofauna.  Dr. Robert Chandler, Curator of Birds at the Florida State Museum has agreed to provide information on potentially endangered birds.  Likewise, Dr. William Evans a mammalogist at Texas A&M Galveston working on cetaceans has agreed to consult with us to inform EPA and other workshop participants on the status of mammalian populations and efforts to ensure their viability.<p>

     The workshop will be held on the grounds of the Gulf Coast Research Laboratory in Ocean Springs, Mississippi in months 6-9 of the grant and at an exact time to be decided upon by project participants and EPA.  GCRL has served as host to EPA workshops in the past and has adequate meeting rooms and other facilities necessary to conduct a successful workshop.  This location has the advantage of being centrally located on the Gulf of Mexico, which would reduce overall travel and phone costs for participants at both ends of the Gulf and is near the Gulf of Mexico Program headquarters at the Stennis Space Center, which would facilitate administration of the workshop and its coordination with other EPA activities.  Meetings will take place over two days.  A two day conference would provide participants adequate opportunity to jointly examine information from EPA and  invited experts on issues bearing on the status of various taxa, and to discuss research needs that will arise in subsequent attempts to establish research and conservation priorities for potentially at-risk species.  A pre-workshop report would be made available to participants to facilitate focused discussion and an action-oriented agenda.  A final report summarizing the workshop, presenting its findings, and providing comprehensive appendices of critical documentation would be prepared subsequent to the workshop.<p>
     Products that would be forthcoming in preparation of the workshop based on examination of records within these collections would include: 1) historical trend analysis of potentially declining species, 2) documentation of species with limited, highly restricted distributions, or potentially vulnerable life-stages, 3) documentation of habitats presently in decline, 4) a list of collections and studies implementing quantitative or semi-quantitative sampling techniques, 5) a database of available aerial photographic resources that can be drawn upon for more detailed study, and 6) a database of relevant scientific literature that together with items 1-4 above would be critical to the determination of future research needs. <p>
<b>ACTIONS TO DATE</b>: GCRL has in place a Mosaic-compliant program that permits its research database to be searched and queried over the Internet.  Access to this software will be made available to other participants, all of whom are on the Internet.  Its use will greatly facilitate exchange of information, both graphic and textual, provide efficient hyper-text driven links to text, data, and graphics, and transparent file exchange among participants using password protected TCP/IP NFS protocols.  This software can be demonstrated prior to the initiation of the project.  Textual information would also be made available through the Gulf of Mexico Program bulletin-board, which will be made callable from within the GCRL Mosaic program.  If additional funds are made available, the capabilities of this software will be expanded to meet specific needs of EPA and to tie into EPA's own Mosaic home page.  This will occur in conjunction with other action items within the Gulf of Mexico Program or other ongoing Federal programs.  These might include but are not limited to the NMFS stock assessment and monitoring program, the NOAA SEA-MAP project within which GCRL currently has a role, USFW monitoring and assessment activity, Gulf State inventories and monitoring activity, and the National Biological Survey, which is also developing Mosaic-compliant software to address related issues and with which GCRL currently has a memorandum of understanding.<p><hr>

began releasing stripers in 1969. Over 12,000,000 fingerlings
have been stocked by GCRL and associated agencies.  Hundreds of
tagged stripers are reported each year.  Researchers have
examined all stages of the fish's life cycle.  However, this
fishery remains dependent on stocking, since a self-sustaining

<title>Gautier</title>
<h1>City of Gautier</h1><p>

Gautier is one of Mississippi's newest cities and one of its
older communities. Located on the Gulf of Mexico at the mouth of
the Pascagoula River, the city is blessed with abundant waterways
and family-oriented recreational offerings.  Founded in Gautier
covers approximately 10 square miles, and is home to approximately
12,000 residents. Gautier sits in the heart of the Sunbelt, only
90 minutes form New Orleans, Louisiana and less than an hour from
Mobile, Alabama. It has a thriving retail base, and numerous
industrial parks across <a href=jackson.county.html>Jackson County</a>
ensure a consistently low unemployment rate.<p>

The residents of Gautier are a hardworking, community-minded
neighbors who believe in lending a hand to help a friend. The city
boasts a quality educational system, from public pre-school to
higher education programs, through commercial colleges, the 
Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College and a branch of the
University of Southern Mississippi. The city has quality
daycare programs for working parents.  From sprawling waterparks
and handmade craft shops, to game fishing and championship
golf courses, family entertainment abounds.<p>

The city and surrounding area provides a variety of amenities
available to visitors to the Gulf Coast including, Shepard
State Park and Bacot City Park, the newest enclosed shopping
mall in South Mississippi, centrally located golf courses, a
public library and close proximity to Gulf beaches, and the cities 
of Mobile and New Orleans<p>

<h2>Historical Perspective</h2><p>
As Gautier grows and develops, residents are mindful of their
rich history and origins. You can see it in the street names, in
the well preserved homes and historical designations.
When the French came to the area in 1699, they found the
Pascagoula and Biloxi Indian Tribes. Throughout the 1700's and
1800's, colonists settled across Jackson County, using the
Pascagoula River as a means of inland transport.  As commerce
grew along the river, so did settlements along its bands.  The
railroad provided another means of travel, and new roads were
etched across the heavily wooded landscape.<p>
The 1900's brought great industrial growth to Jackson County. 
Ingall's Shipbuilding, Chevron, the Port of Pascagoula and
growing industrial parks helped to make Jackson County the
industrial leader of the state.  As Jackson County's industrial
complexes grew, families looked for a clean, unspoiled area
with the amenities or a productive lifestyle. Many settled
in the Gautier area, with its extensive waterways
and wholesome family environment.<p>


<h2>Municipal Services</h2><p>
Gautier is administered by a mayor and five council members.
The city operates within five departments: Public Safety,
Public Works, Recreation, Planning, and General Government.
The city's police department has a patrol force of well trained
officers, using modern facilities and state-of-the-art
communications equipment.  It's fire department functions out of
2 fire stations, which are augmented by a volunteer fire
department. Bacot City Park offers three baseball fields, a
softball field, picnic areas and a community center.  This
park and Shepard State Park provide many opportunities for 
wholesome, outdoor family entertainment.<p>

<title>Biodiversity Kiosk -- Ginglyostoma cirratum</title>
<h1>Ginglymostoma cirratum (Bonnaterre 1788)</h1><p>

<img src="/gcrl/avi/ginglymostoma.cirratum.gif">

<h2>Common Name: Nurse Shark</h2><p>

<h2>Distinguishing Features:</h2><p>

The Nurse shark can be distinguished from other sharks in the Gulf of Mexico by the presence of a long barbel on the anterior margin of each nostril and of a deep groove connecting the nostril with the terminally placed mouth.<p>

This species has two dorsal fins, the first being much shorter than the caudal, its origin over or posterior to the pelvics.  The caudal fin is much less than 1/2 the total length, its axis little raised, and not lunate in form, nor is its lower anterior corner expanded as a definite lobe.  The medial margins of pelvics posterior to cloaca are either separated or united for only a very short distance.  The caudal peduncle not greatly flattened dorso-ventrally or expanded laterally.  Precaudal pits are absent and the sides of trunk anterior to anal fin lacks longitudinal ridges.  The snout is not elongate, nor are jaws widely protrusible.  The fourth and fifth gill slits are positioned over base of pectoral.  The gill arches are without rakers and not interconnected by a sieve of modified denticles.  Spiracles are present.  The lower eyelid lacks a nictitating fold or membrane, but the orbit has a longitudinal fleshy fold above
and below, inside the eyelids.  The teeth are small, with several cusps. There are 0-3 rostral cartilages, which when present are separate at the tip and very small.  The mesopterygium of pectoral fin is nearly as large as metapterygium and has nearly as many radials.  A foramen separates the  mesopterygia and metapterygia.  The heart has two rows of valves.


<h2>Similar Species:</h2><p>

Most species of orectolobiform sharks inhabit
the western Pacific, Australian region, or Indian Ocean, including the Red Sea. Of the roughly 15 genera, only two,<i>Rhincodon</i> Smith 1829 and  <i>Ginglymostoma</i> Muller and Henle, 1837 occur in the Atlantic.   The majority are small, but a few grow to a considerable size, including the Whale Shark, <i>Rhincodon typus</i> the largest living fish and the sole member of the related family Rhincodontidae.  <i>Ginglymostoma</i> has in the past been placed into the Orectolobidae, the Carpet or Zebra sharks, many of which live on bottom in shallow water and are conspicuously marked, especially when young.  These often differ from the nurse shark by having numerous cirri and flaps over the head and body.  Applegate (1972) and Compagno (1973) place this species in the family Ginglymostomatidae.  Dingerkus (1986) placed the nurse shark into the Rhincodontidae. The genus <i>Ginglymostoma</i> contains 2 or 3 species.  <i>Ginglymostoma ferrugineum</i> Lesson 1830 occurs in the Western tropical pacific, and the Indian Ocean to the Red Sea.  The closely related <i>Ginglymostoma brevicaudatum</i> Gunther, 1866 from Zanzibar and the Seychelles was recently placed into a separate genus <i>Pseudoginglymostoma</i> Dingerkus, 1986.<p>

<h2>Biological Data:</h2><p>
Little is known of the biology of nurse sharks. The diet of nurse sharks consists primarily of bottom dwelling invertebrates and fishes.  Development ovoviviparous with as many as 26 young (Budker, 1935).<p>

<h2>Distribution:</h2><p>

<i>Ginglymostoma cirratum</i> is an extremely wide-ranging speices, occuring on both sides of tropical and subtropical Atlantic, along the west coast of Mexico, and in western tropical Pacific from Malaysia into the Indian Ocean and Red Sea.<p>

<h2>Maximum Size of the Species:</h2><p>

The maximum length so far reported is 4.3 m, but maturity is likely reached at a relatively small size.  A 150 cm female has been reported (Bigelow and Schroeder, 1948) containing well developed embryos.  This species weighs about 2 kg at 70 cm and about 150 to 168 kg at about 260 cm.<p>

<h2><i>Fundulus</i> <i>jenkinsi</i></h2>
<p>
<hr>
<p><h3>Other scientific names appearing in the literature of this species:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Zygonectes jenkinsi</i>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p><h3>Common name: Saltmarsh topminnow.</h3>
<hr>
<p><h3>Distinguishing Features:</h3>Males and females have cross-hatching on their backs and
sides, a short dark band on the opercle at about the level of the orbit, and have numerous small
dark spots over the lateral surface of the body.  Cross-hatching may be a distinct grey-green or
much fainter. These spots may be round or form short vertical bars, except in some females which
may be devoid of spots.  Dorsal fin with 8-9 rays, originating slightly posterior to anal-fin origin. 
Anal fin with 11-13 rays.  Lateral scale rows about 33.  Scales around the caudal peduncle 16.
<hr>
<p><h3>Similar Species: </h3>This species may be confused with individuals of <i>Fundulus
grandis</i> and <i>Fundulus pulvereus</i> at small sizes.  However, in the latter species the
dorsal fin originates at or anterior to the anal fin origin.
<hr>
<p><h3>Biology:</h3>
<p>This species has been placed into the subgenus <i>Zygonectes</i> (Brown, 1957; Rosen
1973; Wiley, 1986), with Wiley regarding this species as a primitive member of the subgenus.
<p>This species can tolerate salinites from about 1 o/oo (Thompson, 1980) to 20.6 o/oo
(Simpson and Gunter, 1956).  Robins et al. (1980) report the species occuring in fully freshwater,
but Gilbert (1992) noted that this was without supporting data.  Peterson and Ross (1991)
collected the predominance of their material (192 of 240) from an oligohaline station in Old Fort
Bayou, Mississippi averaging 4.0 o/oo (ranging from 0-10 o/oo), whereas their tidal freshwater
station approximtely 4km upstream averaging 0.9 o/oo (ranging from 0-4 o/oo) yielded a single
individual.  In contrast 47 specimens were collected at their mesohaline station about 14 km
downstream.
<hr>
<p><h3>Maximum size:</h3>Males reach 45 mm in standard length, whereas females grow to 60
mm SL (Simpson and Gunter, 1956).
<hr>
<p><h3>Distribution:</h3>This species occurs along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico at sporadic
sites between Galveston Bay, Texas and Escambia Bay, Florida (Simpson and Gunter, 1956;
Hoese and Moore, 1977; Thompson, 1980; Gilbert, 1992).  The hiatus between Galveston and
most Louisiana records in the eastern part of the state, is probably a sampling artifact as one lot
has been collected from Lake Calsieu (NLU 63749).  
<p>Of 108 records tabulated to date, about one-third have produced specimens in double digit
numbers.  Among relatively early collections there are only two with more than 20 specimens One
was taken in two consequtive years (1950 and 1951) in and around Dickinson Bayou, near
Dickinson, Texas (with a total of 24 specimens taken at 6 of 84 collections at by Simpson and
Gunter, 1956).  Another was made from in a stretch of the Escambia River (80 specimens
reported by Bailey, Winn and Smith, 1954). Most records of greater than 20 specimens per lot
appear concentrated in eastern Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama, with Mississippi localities
yielding as many as 270 specimens per lot (TU 138528) from a flood pool of the Biloxi River. 
Another very large lot (TU 130128) of 220 specimens was collected in St. Louis Bay at Bayou
Portage, less than 45 km away.  Of 21 lots with more than 25 specimens, all but 8 are from
Mississippi, and all remaining largle lots collected either less than about 125 km west (Denis Pass
and Ft. Jackson, Louisiana) or less than about 125 km to the east (Fish River, Alabama draining
eastern Mobile Bay and the Escambia River in western Florida).  Although the identifications of
specimens in these larger lots has yet to be checked, all were collected and identified by
ichthyologists with considerable experience with coastal fishes.
<hr>
<p><h3>Status in the Gulf of Mexico:</h3>As first suggested by Simpson and Gunter (1956),
this species appears to have highly specific, yet poorly known, ecological requirements that result
in a scattered or spotty distribution.  Based on records now available, it would appear that this 
patchiness is due, in part to sampling artifact.  Unfortunately many records do not indicate the
amount of time spent at a given site, thus providing a comparative measure of effort/unit time. 
Nonetheless, the area of probable primary abundance, as reflected by the spatial concentration lots
with relatively large numbers of individuals, is relatively restricted.  Since the region of  greatest
abundance appears to center along the Mississippi coast, which is now undergoing tremendous
changes with loss of wetlands associated with increased human population in areas immediately
adjacent to its habitat, population numbers should be studied further to determine if declines in
numbers are occuring and if so, underwhat circumstances.  The species remains classified as
threatened in Florida (Relyea, 1978; Gilbert, 1972).
<hr>
<p><h3>Recommendations:</h3>Studies of the life history and population ecology of this
species should be undertaken, with voucher materials in limited numbers taken to assure accurate
identification.  Efforts are required to alert field workers in numerous disciplines to be aware of
the species' potential presence and to provide information sufficient to insure correct
identification without significantly depleting local populations.  As a more complete understanding
of the microhabitat requirements of this species becomes available, consideration should be given
to restricting activities that may affect the primarily <i>Spartina</i> beds, with which the species
appears associated, such as bulwark and pier construction, chanelization, and wake production
from water craft traveling at high speeds.

<hr>
<p><h3>Common name: Opposum pipefish.</h3>
<hr>
<p><h3>Distinguishing Features.</h3>  This species has a long snout and very well developed
body ridges, each with a single spine at each ring dorsolaterally.  It is the only Gulf of Mexico
pipefish with the brood pouch confined entirely to the trunk.  Dorsal fin-rays 33-54.  Caudal rays
9.  Trunk rings 16-20 and tail rings 20-26.  In breeding adults the ventral surface of the snout is
bright red taversed by black vertical bars.  The dorsal surface of the snout and posterior half of
head and body are a  reddish or orangish brown, with a series of dark red blotches lateral trunk
rings that merge to a red stripe between superior and lateral trunk rings.  The inferior trunk
ridges are edged with silver and silver stripe extends between the lateral and inferior trunk
ridges.  The caudal fin is red.  Juveniles are less strikingly colored, light brown, or nearly
transparent.
<hr>
<p><h3>Similar Species.</h3>  This species is superficially similar to a number of other
pipefishes occuring in the Gulf of Mexico, perhaps most notably <i>Cosmocampus
brachycephalus</i>, the deepwater pipefish, <i>Syngnathus hildebrandi</i>, the dwarf pipefish,
<i>Syngnathus floridae</i>, the dusky pipefish, <i>Syngnathus pelagicus</i>, the <i>sargassum
pipefish</i> and <i>Syngnathus louisianae</i> the chain pipefish.  However, it can usually be
distinugished readily from these species by the position of the bood pouch and by the presence
of
spines or denticulations on the dorso-lateral margins of the trunk rings, which are absent in these
species and the presence of usually 9 rather than usually 10 caudal fin rays.  In young under
about
85-90 mm these spines are serrate and have posterior angles.  In most adults they are denticulate,
whereas in others the body ridges are smooth.
<hr>
<p><h3>Biological Data.</h3>  This is the only member of the Doryrhamphinae or trunk-pouch
pipefishes occuring in the western Atlantic.  
<p><i>Microphis brachyurus lineatus</i> has been regarded by Dawson, the most widely
regarded  taxonomist  subspecifically distinct from <i>Microphis brachyurus brachyurus</i> its
Indo-Pacific counterpart (Dawson, 1979, 1982, 1985).  However, other ichthyologists have
considered these species as  specifically distinct from its Indo-Pacific counterparts.  Although
the taxonomy of Dawson (1978, 1982,  1985) is followed here, work detailing the differences
between the two subspecies has not been investigated in a multivariate statistical context capable
of distinuishing differences that would not be apparent from overlapping statistical distributions
of  counts and measurements treated univariately.  Molecular differentiation has likewise not
been investigated. Further investigations may warrant the elevation of <i>Microphis</i>
(<i>Oostethus</i>) <i>brachyurus</i> to species rank.
<p>Gilbert (1992) regards Valenciennes as the author of this species given that Kaup (1856)
specifically referred to the species as "<i>Doryichthys lineatus</i> Valenciennes MS". 
However, no description attributable to Valenciennes otherwise appears in the text and Kaup,
who first provides a published description of the species, must be regarded as the author.
<p>In providing identifications for Luling (1974), Herald considered Brazilian material as a
distinct species, <i>Siphostoma eigenmanni</i> Wilson, 1960.  Although statistically significant
differences in dorsal-fin rays exist between populations from Bahamas and Antilles, those from
the United States through Central American and northern South America, and from those in
Brazil, Dawson (1982) interpreted the differences as clinal without an analysis of spatial
autcorrelation.  Futher taxonomic studies are warranted, as Gulf of Mexico populations may
require reassignment.  If these differences are not clinal but due to interspecific differentiation,
<i>Syngnathus cayennensis</i> Sauvage 1882, would appear to be the earliest available name
for the more northern group of populations.
<p>Like all pipefish species, the females deposits her eggs in the brood pouch of the male, who
retains them internally until hatching.  According to Dawson (1982) eggs of this species are
relatively numerous with 4-6 transverse egg rows in small males and in 10-11 rows in large
males.  The eggs are not bound within a gelatinous matrix.  Herald (1943) estimated 744 eggs in
a 147 mm male, with egg diameters ranging from 0.6 to 0.8 mm.  Dawson (1982) reports the
smallest male with a developed brood pouch was 91.5.  He reported the smallest male with
observable eggs was 102 mm, but noted that eggs are frequently lost during preservation.
<p>No information on feeding is available, except a report of feeding in aquarium-hatched
larvae (Gilmore, 1977b).  Gilbert and Kelso (1971) reported that unidentified jack
(<i>Caranx</i> sp. had fed on 65-80 mm juveniles.
<p>Adults are primarily collected inshore, usually in shallow water, sometimes virtually fresh
usually in depths of 0.2-3 m (Dawson, 1970; Gilbert and Kelso, 1971; Gilmore, 1977a) in
salinities ranging from 0.03 o/oo (Herrema, 1974) to 35 o/oo (Eskinazi, 1972).  Gilbert (1992)
reports the species in the Loxahatchee River drainage, the St. Lucie River, Sebastian Creek, the
St. Lucie Canal at Lake Okeechobee and associated canals, and in the southern end of Indian
River lagoon, indicating a broad tolerence to hyposaline conditions.  However, offshore
collections are known from near the surface to depths of 183 m (Dawson, 1982).  The species
has been collected over spermatophye bottoms in East Florida (Gilmore, 1977) and from
<i>Sargassum</i> in the Bahamas and West Florida (Bohlke and Chaplin, 1928; Hastings and
Bortone, 1976) and <i>Spartina</i> marsh grass in Mississippi (Dawson, 1970).  Dawson
(1982) reports Central and South American specimens taken on a variety of bottom types,
including muddy mangrove swamps and densely vegetated streams.  It was reported by
Hildebrand (1939) near the Pacific terminus of the Panama Canal.
<p>Live specimens have been reported to produce high-frequency viabrations and faint
clincking noises (McLane, 1955).
<p>Although Herald and Dawson (1972) reported breeding in both marine and freshwater
habitats, Dawson (1982) later indicated that then available evidence, based on additional
material indicated that breeding occurs in fresh or estuarine waters, and that euryhaline young
may develop in fresh water, estuarine or oceanic environments.  Dawson (1970, 1982) noted
they occur from June-September in Mississippi estuarine waters.  More recent evidence (Gilbert,
1978, 1992), suggests reproduction of Florida populations is entirely confined to freshwater. 
Gilmore (1976b) reported brooding males during July and November in eastern Florida. 
Gilmour (1977) describes hatchlings of 3 to 6 mm.  Young subsequently move into offshore
waters where they remain for an indeterminate time period (Gilbert, 1992).  Young occur in
patches of floating sargassum, as far as 60 km offshore (Dawson, 1982) and have be taken with
lights at night (Robins, et al., 1986).  Dawson (1982) observed both brooding males, females,
and juveniles in a small Brazilian freshwater stream in Bahia.  According to Gilbert and Kelso
(1972) maturing juveniles 60-90 mm in length from Costa Rican populations return to
freshwater.  Gilbert (1992) reports maturation and breeding in freshwater habitats, with dense
emergent vegetation, most notably species of <i>Panicum</i> and <i>Polygonum</i>.  Little
else is known of the biology of this species other than its taxonomy, morphometry, and
distribution.
<hr>
<p><h3>Maximum size:</h3>  This species reaches 194 mm (Dawson, 1982).
<hr>
<p><h3>Distribution.</h3>  Dawson (1979, 1982) reported this species to range from New
Jersey to Sao Paulo, Brazil and near the western terminus of the Panama canal.  Only few reports
of specimens from the Gulf of Mexico exist.  It has also been reported in  the Bahamas, Cuba,
and the Antilles.  In U.S. territorial waters, one from a single juvenile taken from Destin, in
western Florida and in Biloxi Bay, Mississippi.
<p>Status in the Gulf of Mexico:  All indications suggest that this species is dependent on
accessible coastal freshwater habitat for survival, areas that are increasingly impacted by
humans.  This species has been upgraded from rare to threatened by the Florida Committee on
Rare and endangered Plants and Animals.  No additional specimens have been taken from
Destin.  The whereabouts and date of collection of the specimen reported by Dawson (1982)
from Destin is unknown.  Dawson (1970, 1972, 1982) indicated the Biloxi Bay population
recurred annually (from 1967-1971).  Dawson (1970) first suggested that young of from
Mississippi were unable to overwinter and were recruited from the Gulf of Mexico.  Later
(1982) he suggested that available evidence indicated that they breed nearshore, perhaps in fresh
or brackish waters.  However, no specimens have been captured in recent years, despite
significant collecting activity in Biloxi Bay.  The only other collections in the Gulf of Mexico
are from the region of the Gulf of Campeche, southward of Tamaulipas, Mexico (Dawson,
1982).
<p>Gilbert (1992) notes that bank vegetation in Florida is utilized by <i>M</i>. <i>brachyurus
lineatus</i> is often treated seasonally with herbicides.
<p>The status of this species outside of U.S. territorial waters is unknown.
<p><h3>Recommendations:</h3>  Efforts to reduce the risk of loosing this species must include
means to limit modification of coastal freshwater stream habitats and establish buffer areas to
prevent loss and degredation of habitat.  Efforts must be made to ensure that water management
projects and recreational uses do not alter natural stream hydrology and vegetation in areas in 
which <i>M</i>. <brachyurus</i> remains extant or may based on previous collections be
expected to recolonize, if the species is to have a chance to survive.  Herbicide spraying
programs targeting opposum pipefish habitat should be eliminated.  Other point and nonpoint
pollutants in lower reaches of coastal streams should be reduced or eliminated.  Study of the
effects of factors potentially influencing water quality or turbidity, such as nearshore dredging,
filling, or diminution of suitable vegetation, such as the presence of pollutants, channelization,
bulkheading, or pier construction should be undertaken to establish means of mitigating or
eliminating potential adverse impacts.  Research is needed in identifying areas where suitable
habitat still exists along the Gulf of Mexico and in establishing specific microhabitat
requirements.   The populations dynamics of this species in both in time and space needs to be
studied, particularly early life history stages.  The taxonomic rank to be applied to this
subspecies also requires further study to determine whether northern and southern populations
are the same species.

<hr>
<p><h3>Common name: Fringed pipefish.</h3>
<hr>
<p><h3>Distinguishing Features.</h3> A species of pipefish with inconspicuous bony ridges on
the trunk and tail, no anal fin, and small fleshy tabs scattered over the body and top of the head. 
Dorsal fin-rays 15-19.  Pectoral fin rays 6-9 (usually 8).  Caudal rays usually 10.  Trunk rings
14-16 (usually 15) and tail rings 35-40 (often 36-37).
<hr>
<p><h3>Similar Species.</h3>This species is similar to the insular pipefish, <i>Micrognathus
tectus</i>, which also lacks an anal fin.  However, the insular pipefish has the trunk and tail rings
moderately developed, 10-12 pectoral fin rays (usually 10-11), usually 17 trunk rings (17-18),
usually 32-24 tail rings (31-35), and rarely has fleshy tabs on the body.
<hr>
<p><h3>Biological Data.</h3>
<hr>
<p>This species has been reported almost exclusively from grassbeds in water less than 5 m in
depth and at salinities ranging from 19.2 o/oo (FDNR, 1977) to 52 o/oo (Resendes, 1975). 
Springer and Bullis (1956) report a sample dipnetted at the surface over 7.7 m.  One specimen
noted by Dawson from North Carolina caught at 10.7 may have been netted at the surface.  The
whereabouts of this specimen is presently unknown.  Fowler (1944) recorded records from
"drifting weed" and Powell and Strawn (1963) record the species from <i>Sargassum</i>. 
<p>This species appears to eat copepods, mysids, amphipods, iosopods, and ostracods (Reid,
1954; Brown, 1972).
<p>Studies of Florida populations revealed mature males present in all months but May, and
December through February.  Such males bear eggs in 2-4 transverse rows in one or more layers. 
Females 51.5 mm and greater with late stage oocytes were found during April through
September, in January and March (Reid, 1954; Powell and Strawn, 1963; Brown, 1972).  These
authors report the smallest male with a developed brood pouch was 60 mm, with egg diameters of
0.9-1.3 mm.  Larvae 5.5-6.0 mm were observed with a yolk of about 1.0 mm diameter by Reid
(1954).   Dawson (1982) reported the smallest male with a  brood pouch of 54 mm, while a 79.5
mm male had 34 eggs in a single 2 row layer. 

No other information is available about the biology of these species.

<p><h3>Maximum size:</h3>  This species reaches 94 mm (Brown, 1972).  Robins et al. (1986)
report specimens reaching 10 cm, but no specimens this large have yet been located in museum
collections.
<hr>
<p><h3>Distribution.</h3>This species has been taken from the Bahamas, North Carolina, from
southeastern Florida, and in the Gulf of Mexico between West Florida and the Chandeleur Islands,
and in Yucatan.  A single record from Quintana Roo is the only Caribbean record.  According to
Dawson (1982), literature records from Cameron Louisiana (Weymouth, 1910) and from Brazil
are probably erroneous, the former the result of confusion with materials colected from the
Chandeleur Islands and the latter based of damaged <b>ALBATROSS</b> material with catalog
data that do not match the jar data.  
<p><h3>Status in the Gulf of Mexico:</h3>This rare species appears to be more common in the
northeastern and eastern Gulf than in the northern Gulf.  The species may be exptirpated from
Mississippi Sound, although a 1990 record exists (GCRL 23740) from the west end of North
Island, Chandeleur Islands.  Given its

<title>Military</title>
<h1>Military</h1><p>

<h2>Keesler Air Force Base</h2><p>

Keesler Air Force Base is the home of the 81st Training Wing, the
computer; electronics, and weather training center for the United
States Air Force. Keesler is the second largest technical
training base in the Air Force and comes under the direction of
its parent organization, the Air Education and Training Command,
headquartered at Randolph Air Force Base, San Antonio, Texas.<p>

Keesler is located in the heart of Biloxi, Mississippi, on a
3,600 acre tract of land which was donated to the U.S. Government
in 1941. It has been a major military training installation since
World War II when 142,000 aircraft mechanics and 336,000 recruits
were trained at the installation.<p>
  
Keesler's primary mission has always been training. Today, the
concentration is on high-technology training. Students come to
Keesler fresh from basic military training at Lackland AFB,
Texas, and are trained in a number of fields, primarily in
electronics specialties. Avionics maintenance, radio and radar
systems maintenance, communications-electronics, computer systems
programming and maintenance, and air traffic control are but a
few of the main electronics-related courses taught at Keesler.
Other major programs include personnel and administration.<p>

Keesler's course load recently increased with the gaining of
courses from closing bases. With the closing of Chanute AFB,
Illinois, Keesler gained the Department of  Defense Weather
School which trains Air Force, Navy, Marine, Coast Guard and
foreign military in weather forecasting and observing.<p>

With the closing of Lowry AFB, Colorado, Keesler gained the
Precision Measurement Equipment Laboratory training. Keesler is
also gaining a flying training mission.  In the summer of '94,
Keesler began training C-12 and C-21 pilots.  With these come
additional students and permanent party members.<p>

Approximately 1,064 military and civilian instructors teach an
average daily student load of 4,063 students in more than 500
resident and nonresident courses. Courses range in length from
less than one week to almost seven months, depending on the
subject. The average basic airman course is 102 days long and the
average basic officer course is 56 days. In all, Keesler
graduated 25,178 students in the fiscal year of 93.  In July,
1993, Keesler gained Headquarters 2nd Air Force which manages all
operational aspects of the more than 2,200 formal training
courses taught to approximately 235,000 students annually in Air
Education and Training Command.<p>

In addition to training, Keesler has two units with flying
missions. The 7th Airborne Command and Control Squadron of Air
Combat Command provides command and control of tactical air
operations in forward battle areas. The unit has been at Keesler
for 19 years and will be relocating to Davis Monthan AFB in
Tucson, Arizona, in the summer of 1994.<p>

The 403rd Airlift Wing of the Air Force Reserve is responsible
for tactical airlift support of airborne forces, equipment and
supplies. The 53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron, part of the
403rd AW, flies hurricane hunting and storm tracking missions,
and relays weather information to the National Hurricane Center
in Miami. Both flying units use modified versions of the C-130
Hercules aircraft.<p>

Keesler also boasts of having the second largest medical
treatment facility in the Air Force. Keesler Medical Center
contains a 240-bed multispecialty facility, 62 outpatient
clinics, a clinical research laboratory and aeromedical
facilities to serve 39 Air Force, Army and Navy bases in the
southeastern United States. Staffed by more than 2,000 doctors,
nurses and medical technicians, the medical center also provides
residency training in pediatrics, obstetrics/gynecology, internal
medicine, surgery and dental medicine. The Commission on
Accreditation for Hospital & Health Care Organizations recently
rated Keesler Medical Center in the top 6 percent of civilian and
military medical treatment facilities in the  United States.<p>

Keesler's total population is about 27,000 people. This includes
an average of 9,034 military, more than 4,400 civilians, and
13,553 military family members.<p>

On base family housing consists of 1,953 units, and the occupancy
rate is maintained at nearly 99 percent year round. All students,
with the exception of a small percentage who are married, live in
Keesler dormitories.<p>

There are more than 4,000 military families living off-base in
the surrounding communities. The majority of families live in
Biloxi, and many more live in Ocean Springs, Gulfport, and
D'Iberville.<p>

In fiscal year 1993, the military payroll was more than $112
million, and the civilian payroll was more than $67 million.<p>

In addition to the active duty military at Keesler, there are
more than 8,771 retired military people representing all branches
of the service living on the Mississippi Gulf Coast. Their
retirement income for fiscal year 1993 totaled more than $123
million.<p>


During the year, Keesler spent $62 million on local contracts for
construction, services, Commissary/BX, health care and
educational impact aid funds.<p>

This means that $242.5 million in real dollars was available to
the Mississippi Gulf Coast economy as a result of Keesler Air
Force Base. But the overall economic impact was more.<p>  

The Air Force Engineering and Services Center at Tyndall
AFB,Fla., estimates that every dollar put into the local economy
results in an actual economic impact of about $1.77. When this is
considered, the total economic impact Keesler has on the Gulf
Coast was more than $429 million.<p>

<h2>Naval Station Pascagoula</h2><p>

Ground was broken for the construction of Naval Station
Pascagoula on Singing River Island in 1988.  The first occupants
moved onto the island in January 1991.  The station was formally
dedicated on July 4, 1992, and in the same month became home to
USS GALLERY (FFG 26).  During the first part of 1993, three more
Perry class guided missile frigates tied up at the 680-foot,
state-of-the-art double deck pier: USS JACK WILLIAMS (FFG 24) on
January 28, USS STEPHEN W. GROVES (FFG 29) on February 2, and USS
JOHN L. HALL (FFG 32). on March 15.<p>

In October 1992, ground was broken and construction was begun on
the medical/dental facility, the last building to be constructed
under the original development plan.  The first half of 1993 saw
the official opening of the weapons facility, the enlisted dining
facility, the bachelor enlisted quarters, the Navy exchange, and
the gymnasium.  The medical/dental facility was completed this
past fall and dedicated on December 3, 1993.<p>

In May 1993, an official ceremony marked the naming of the
streets at the naval station after ships either built or
refurbished at Ingalls Shipbuilding.  In August, the Mississippi
Medal of Honor Park at the station was dedicated.  Seventeen
recipients of the Congressional Medal of Honor who were either
born or enlisted in the military in Mississippi were honored for
their valiant deeds.  Their pictures and biographies have been
placed throughout the park.<p>

Naval Station Pascagoula's mission is to provide quality support
to U.S. Atlantic fleet ships and their families.  It was
partially built with contributions from the state of Mississippi,
Jackson County, and the City of Pascagoula.  These contributions
were used to build the 2.7 mile causeway, the pier and wharf, and
the roads and utilities on the station.<p>

Singing River Island was given to the Navy by the State of
Mississippi and the Jackson County Port Authority.  The Island
has sandy beaches and refuge areas for wildlife.<p>

The naval station is a model for environmental quality.  It has
modern in-ground tanks and an ongoing recycling program.  It is
located only 10 miles from the Gulf of Mexico, insuring quick 
access to deep water for the ships homeported there.<p>

On March 1, USS FLATLEY (FFG 21) became the fifth ship to be
homeported in Pascagoula.  In April the naval station will be
getting one more frigate. The Shore Intermediate Maintenance
Activity, the largest tenant on the station will double by June.
In addition, DESRON SIX will be transferring to the naval station
in May.<p>

<h2>SUPSHIP Pascagoula</h2><p>

The Supervisor of Shipbuilding, better known as SUPSHIP, was
established in 1951, and is collocated with Ingalls Shipbuilding.
SUPSHIP, consist of 500 plus military and civilian personnel under the sponsorship of the Commander Naval Sea System 
Command,Washington, D.C. Annual salary  impact to the coast is
about $22 million.<p>

SUPSHIP Pascagoula's mission is to administer Navy Department and
other Department of Defense shipbuilding and air contracts at
assigned private shipyards along 200 miles of the Gulf of Mexico-
13 shipyards in Mississippi, Alabama, and the Florida
Panhandle.<p>

The work is accomplished under Master Ship Repair Agreements or
new construction shipbuilding contracts. During Fiscal Year 1993,
SUPSHIP Pascagoula paid in excess of $ 1.2 billion in progress
payments to local shipyards and has a contractual backlog of work
on the Coast totalling over $4 billion.<p>

In addition to Ingalls, SUPSHIP administers contracts with the
Gulfport-based Trinity Marine Group (Halter and Moss Point
Marine) for TAGS 60, 61, and 62 valued at approximately $150
million and a $30 million contract for the Philippine Navy to
build Logistic Support Vehicles.<p>

SUPSHIP Pascagoula also provides military and administrative
support to precommissioning crews assigned in the Jackson County
area.<p>

<title>Ocean Springs History</title>
<h1>Ocean Springs History</h1><p>

The quiet oak lined streets and the serene atmosphere of Ocean
Springs hide a history that goes back more than 295 years. Pierre
LeMoyne d'Iberville stepped ashore here in 1699, establishing for
France the first permanent settlement in the vast central area of
North America.  The French colonists who remained, lived in a
primitive conditions similar to the Indians. For almost a hundred
years, the scattered settlers heard little news from abroad.  The
colonists slept through the great event of the American
Revolution, but in 1780, they were told to register their claims
and make a new oath to the Spanish at Mobile. In 1810, a local
revolt against the Spanish caused the United States government to
step in and take possession of the Coast country. Now the French
settlers encountered the Americans moving west in search of river
land.<p>

The area started growing with the advent of the shallow-draft
paddlewheel steamboats. The boats had to make frequent stops to
take on wood and fresh water between runs from New Orleans and
Mobile. Ocean Springs became known for its many natural springs
that had medicinal qualities to cure all types of ailments. The
Ocean Springs Hotel was established on the west side of Jackson
Avenue.  Visitors could depart from a steamboat on the wharf and
traverse half a block up to the hotel. The beachhead had become
alive again.<p>

In 1853, there were about 15 families living in the community and
they christened it Lynchburg Springs in honor of an enterprising
merchant who then operated a trading post on Fort Bayou.<p>

The name of Ocean Springs was coined by Dr. George W. Austin, a
New Orleans physician who established a sanitarium to take
advantage of the health-giving springs.  The name was adopted in
1854 in a happy combination of words describing the little
village's twin attractions. In that same year, the Mississippi
legislature incorporated the village. Even the remote town of
Ocean Springs heard the rumblings of Civil War. Federal troops
occupied Ship Island some 12 miles in the Mississippi Sound and
there were sporadic visitations of Federal patrols, but no major
damage reported in Ocean Springs. With the fall of the
steamboats, the town once again became a sleepy village. 
Families did without a lot of necessities, such as flour,
tobacco, clothing, shoes and spices.<p>

Less than three months after the South's surrender at Appomattox,
preparations were being made to get the steamboats back into
service and, once again, they graced the waters. Then, the era of
the railroads came.<p>

On November 21, 1870, freight and passenger services were opened
between Mobile and New Orleans. The steamboat whistle was
replaced by the train whistle as a sound of prosperity. Once
again as the "main street" of Ocean Springs, the south end of
Jackson Avenue, yielded to the importance of the north end of
Washington Avenue which was closer to the tracks. In 1880, the
Louisville & Nashville Railroad (L&N) took over the line.  About
that time, the pecan and oyster businesses started growing and a
boom was on which lasted until the 1930's.<p>

Ocean Springs was established as a municipality in 1892 with a
mayor-alderman form of government. The first public school
structure in Ocean Springs was a handsome white building on East
Porter Street at Dewey where the city hall now stands. After the
Florida land boom of the 20's the citizens voted $80,000 for a
modern school building which authorities located on Government
Street between Magnolia and Ward. There was violent opposition to
the school's new location because at that time, Government was
the busy Highway 90 and it was considered out-of-town. The
building still proudly stands, housing the school administration
offices.<p>

In the early 1900s, the resort era came to an end with the
accidental burning of two of the main hotels.  The present day
L&N Depot was built in 1907 and it soon became the hub of the
town's activities.  Railway express was used to deliver and
receive goods. Before the days of telephone and radio the depot
was the nerve center of the town because of the Western Union
station located there.  Today, Ocean Springs is still a thriving
Gulf Coast community with the charm of the older homes,winding
lanes and peaceful trees which shade its past. Passenger

<title>Ocean Springs Recreation</title>
<img src="/gcrl/mosaic/osships.gif" align=left><p>
<h1>Ocean Springs Recreation</h2><p>

Ocean Springs boasts a national park, Gulf Islands National
Seashore, located in east Ocean Springs.  Formerly Magnolia State
Park, the area was designated a national seashore by a 1971
Congressional Act and is under jurisdiction of the Department of
the Interior National Park Service.  An access road from Highway
90, just east of the hospital, leads directly into the park
complex.<p>

The Park has many year-round facilities, including a campground
with 51 sites, electric and water hookups and a sewage dump
station. The area also has a group tent area, picnic shelters,
ballfield, guided nature trail and boat dock with ramps. The
William M. Colmer Visitor Center has sales publications,
exhibits, films and information on Gulf Island activities.<p>

It also has a permanent exhibit of carved animal and sea life set
among Walter Anderson murals, an orientation movie theater, and
an exhibition featuring local artists.<p>

The islands offer a more limited range of facilities. Primitive
camping is permitted in all locations on East Ship, Horn and
PetitBois Islands. Limited food service is offered on tour boats
and on West Ship Island. Guided tours of Fort Massachusetts on
West Ship Island are given, and the swim beach has a bathhouse
and lifeguards in the summer.  Fishing is permitted at the park
and on the islands.  During the summer weekends, a park
naturalist guides boat loads of visitors through the bayous. 
These free tours give people a chance to see a large part of an
estuarine system in a way that would not normally be possible. 
Seating is limited on boats.  Schedules of boat tours are
available at the Visitor's Center.  A variety of interpretive
programs, including guided hikes, cast net demonstrations and
slide programs are provided throughout the year. A Junior Ranger
Program for ages 5-12 is given during the summer.<p>

<h2>SAILING, SKIING, CANOEING</h2><p>

The Ocean Springs area is a water wonderland for water sports of
all kinds. It is perfect for a full range of boating, from
canoeing in safe river waters to deep sea fishing. The many
bayous in the city provide easy access to the water. Free boat
ramps are available on the west bank of the entrance to the Ocean
Springs Harbor, on the beach at the foot of Washington Avenue, at
the northeast end of the bridge over Old Fort Bayou, and at the
Gulf Islands National Seashore Park.<p>

The Ocean Springs Yacht Club, located on Front Beach Drive at the
bridge to Biloxi, is a member of the Gulf Yachting Association.
Small sailboat sailors, windsurfers and water skiers ply their
sport in smooth water between Deer Island and the Ocean Springs
Beach. Deep water craft can follow the boat channels from the
harbor to the open water of the Gulf of Mexico on the other side
of the island. Applications for boat registration must be made to
the Department of Wildlife Conservation in Jackson, Mississippi
on forms provided by dealers and the Marine Resources office on
USM Gulf Park Campus in Long Beach.  The cost ranges from $5.00
to $30.00 per boat for a two-year decal.<p>

<h2>BEACHES AND BEACH WEATHER</h2><p>

The beaches of Ocean Springs are well maintained, non-commercial
and ideal for walks along the waterfront at any time.  Around
mid-April afternoon air temperatures begin to climb above 80.
With water temperatures already in the 70s and plenty of sun.
Beach days are plentiful from mid-May through September. Showers
and thunderstorms occur on 8 to 12 days per month in the summer,
but these are often late in the day and brief.<p>

<h2>FISHING</h2><p>

Both saltwater and freshwater fishing can be enjoyed every month
of the year. Fresh waters yield bass, white perch, bream and
other species. Saltwater species available include kingfish,
Spanish mackerel, lemon fish, crevalle, bonita, dolphin, tarpon,
red fish, mackerel, white trout, speckled trout, and many
others.<p>

A non-resident for a three day fishing license for saltwater
would be $8.00. A non-resident would annually pay $23 for
saltwater and $28 for freshwater; however a resident would
annually pay $5 for saltwater and $9 for freshwater.<p>

Crabbing and floundering also provide fun for the entire family. 
Crabbing from the piers or while you wade along the beach is
challenging, exciting and rewarding.<p>

<h2>CAMPING</h2><p>

Located just to the north of Ocean Springs is Martin's Lake and
Campground. It provides paved, level camping sites, heated
showers and full hookups for campers.  A twenty acre lake offers
swimming and fishing. A laundromat, storeroom and gameroom are
among the many facilities.<p>

Just to the northeast of Ocean Springs is a KOA facility with 118
campsites situated with easy access to Highway 90 and Interstate
lO. On the property is a boatramp for fishing in Fort Bayou and a
fully stocked grocery store. Bicycles to rent, adult and teenager
recreation rooms, a laundry room, swimming pool and playground
may also be found there.<p>

<h2>OCEAN SPRINGS YMCA</h2><p>

The Mississippi Gulf Coast YMCA has three locations to serve the
many people along the Gulf Coast.  The Family YMCA is located at
1810 Government St. in Ocean Springs. This facility features an
Olympic size indoor heated pool, fully equipped weight room,
outdoor pool, nature trail and rooms for aerobics, karate and
other programs. The Family YMCA also offers a variety of classes
including scuba, swim lessons, modeling, gun safety and much
more.<p>

The Total Fitness Center is on Hwy. 90 East in Ocean Springs. It
features racquetball courts, jacuzzi, steam room, sauna, indoor
heated pool, fully equipped weightroom and exercise room for
aerobics and more. For more information on the YMCA, call the
Family Y at 875-2966 or Total Fitness Center at 875-0152.<p>

<title>CHEMICAL RESEARCH PROJECTS IN MISSISSIPPI SOUND, MISSISSIPPI</title>
<h1>CHEMICAL RESEARCH PROJECTS IN MISSISSIPPI SOUND, MISSISSIPPI</H1>
<hr>
<img src="/gcrl/mosaic/sound.gif" align=middle><hr>
Several research projects have been conducted in in the Mississippi Sound by Research
Chemists, Dr. Julia Lytle and Dr. Thomas Lytle at the Gulf Coast Research Laboratory
in Ocean Springs, Mississippi during the past 10 years.  Among them has been a study
of pollutants in Sound sediments from over 45 sites, stategically located throughout the
Sound and its surrounding river systems.  This study was designed to locate those areas
most impacted by pollutants and established this impact by a multi-disciplinary study of
chemists, biologists and geologists.  Levels of pollutants, transport pathways, dispersal
characteristics, toxicological properties were among those elements of this study that
permitted the investigators to identify those areas in the Sound that require the most
careful environmental considerations of present and future development strategies.  The
Sound has also been the collection site of many fishes (not ordinarily consumed) that
have been carefully analyzed for potential as consumer products.  Marine fatty acids were
characterized and compared to those of cold-water fishes and examined as function of
size of fish, sex, development stage, season of collection and geographical origin. 
Recently oysters were collected from sites shown on this chart to characterize levels of
tributyltin (potent antifoulant) in tissues of organisms from all active reefs in the Sound. 
A number of other studies have also been conducted wholly or in part in water of the
Mississippi Sound with an effort to identify compounds and processes that are of most
consequence to the health of this vital estuary.

<title>PESTICIDES IN WEEKS BAY</title>

<h1>FIELD VALIDATION OF PESTICIDE IMPACT IN WEEKS BAY, ALABAMA</h1><p>
<hr>
<img src="/gcrl/mosaic/weeks1.gif" align=middle>
<hr>
A study funded by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has as its
major objective to develop broadly applicable and predictive means of
measuring ecological and ecotoxicological effects of pesticide runoff at
species, population and community levels.  The study is being conducted in
laboratories at Gulf Coast Research Laboratory and at field sites (shown in
the chart) in Weeks Bay, Alabama, a National Estuarine Research Reserve.<p> 
<h3>The study objective is being accomplished through two major efforts:</h3>
<ul>
<li>assess the levels of pesticides found in receiving waters, sediments, marsh plants and sessile shellfish and/or other indigenous organisms at the habitat(s) where pesticide impact is indicated during high runoff condition.<p>
<li>correlate laboratory toxicity data for specific pesticides with field  toxicities during maximum levels of these pesticides found during runoff events.<p>
</ul>
<h3>Ancillary to the major objectives are five additional goals:</h3>

<ul>
<li>field validate structural changes in membrane lipids of plant and
animal communities exposed to toxic stress develop a rating system using sediments with which to judge retention, deposition and leachability properties of pesticides within estuarine systems<p>
<li>develop quantitative pore water toxicity tests and correlate results to
sediment characteristics to predict potential toxic impact and/or
general health of a given estuary<p>
<li>examine variation in benthic community structure in relation to measured pesticide loads and organismal end-points<p>
<li>evaluate various bioindicators of sublethal toxicity in estuarine organisms exposed to pesticides.  All objectives for this study are being developed and refined jointly by GCRL, Weeks Bay management and EPA-Gulf Breeze investigators.

<title> OVERVIEW OF PROGRAMS, UGA Department of Crop and Soil Sciences</title>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
                  
<img align=left src="gifs/globe.gif" width=39 height=42><h2>Overview of the Department</h2>
<img src="gifs/line9.gif"><p>

<dd>The faculty of the Department of Crop and Soil Sciences administer and advise students in the undergraduate majors of Crop Science, Environmental Soil Science, and Turfgrass Management.  Presently, there are about 75-80 students in the three majors.  Graduate studies leading to the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees are also available in the department. Presently, there are about 45 graduate students studying in the general areas of crop management and physiology; plant breeding and genetics; weed science; soil fertility; and soil, water, and waste management. <p>

Briefly the three undergraduate majors can be described as follows:<p>

<dd>The <a href="major_cs.htm">Crop Science Major</a> includes courses in genetics, chemistry, botany, entomology, plant pathology, crop science and soil science to prepare students for careers in agribusiness, sales and service, education, farming, agricultural consulting, and within federal agencies such as USDA. <br>

<dd>The <a href="major_es.htm">Environmental Soil Science Major</a> includes courses in chemistry, biology, geology, statistics, and soil science to prepare students for careers in environmental protection, including employment by the Environmental Protection Division of the state governments, waste management companies, environmental consulting firms, and federal agencies such as EPA and USDA.<br>

<dd>The <a href="major_tm.htm">Turfgrass Management Major</a> includes courses in the biological sciences, chemistry, and crop science, as well as specialized courses in turfgrass management and related areas to prepare students for careers in golf course management, athletic field management, landscaping, sod production, grounds management and maintenance, and others.<p> 

<dd> Crop and Soil Science research programs are located at the <a href="http://tifton.cpes.peachnet.edu">Coastal Plain Experiment Station</a> in Tifton, <a href="http://solar.griffin.peachnet.edu/branch/athens.html">College Station</a> in Athens, and the <A HREF="http://solar.griffin.peachnet.edu">Georgia Experiment Station</A> in Griffin.  The general research in the Department of Crop and Soil Sciences can be classified into five areas: 1.<a href="fac_bred.htm"> Cultivar Development</a>; 2. <a href="fac_crop.htm">Crop Management and Physiology</a>; 3. <a href="fac_weed.htm">Weed Management Research</a>; 4. <a href="fac_turf.htm">Turfgrass Management</a>; and 5. <a href="fac_soil.htm">Soil, Fertility, Water, and Waste Management</a>.  Research in these five areas is being carried out at each of the three major locations. <br> 

<dd>Cultivar development programs have been especially successful in recent years.  Some of the recent cultivar releases that are associated with various commodities are "Rebel" canola, "Georgia King" cotton, <a href="alfagraz.htm">"Alfagraze" </a> alfalfa, "Georgia 5" tall fescue, "Tifton 85" bermudagrass, "Tifton 9" bahiagrass, "Tifleaf 2" pearl millet, "Georgia Mitchell" oats, "Georgia Runner" peanut, "Haskell" soybean, "Gore" wheat, and three pearl millet inbreds for grain, released to Gold Kist for hybrid production.  A related program in crop variety testing provides direct information to farmers on performance of available crop varieties. <br> 

<dd> In the crop management and physiology area, research varies from studies of the effect of row spacing, plant population, and planting date on yield of row crops, the effect of plant growth regulators on cotton yield, as well as more basic studies of mechanisms of drought tolerance by crops, and genetic mapping of drought tolerance genes.<br>

<dd> Weed control research programs develop efficient and environmentally safe weed management systems for our major crops in the sate.  Research in these areas have dealt with herbicide activity; selectivity and application; weed biology, ecology, and, physiology; the environmental fate of herbicides; and development of weed management systems for Georgia Crops.<br>

<dd>Soil fertility research has dealt with many subjects including determination of appropriate fertilizer application rates, time and method of fertilizer application, and the relationship of soil test level to the need for fertilizer for two promising new crops - canola and pearl millet.<br>

<dd>In the soil, water, and waste management area, research has dealt with water requirements for our major crops, irrigation scheduling and crop management, tillage research, pesticide and nutrient dissipation in of animal and industrial wastes to soils. <br>

<dd>Agronomic crops are very important to Georgia's economy.  These crops return more than two billion dollars per year to Georgia farmers.  Cotton and peanut are the major crops in terms of profitability, with forage and turf also accounting for substantial economic returns.  Farms are also producing corn and soybean.  Canola and grain millet are emerging crops with a potentially bright future in Georgia.  Extension faculty are responsible for developing and implementing research-based educational programs to enable farmers to sustain profitable production of agronomic crops.<p>

<dd>Crop production in today's environment is complex, and complete production packages must be provided to meet farmers' needs.  <A HREF="http://www.ces.uga.edu">Extension</A> faculty excel in leading multi disciplinary teams which offer all aspects of crop production.  Excellent examples of good interdisciplinary program development and delivery are Extension's nationally recognized cotton and peanut teams.<p>

<P>Mars is a SUN SPARC station 20.  You may wonder why it is named Mars.  Some think it is because many believe deep down in their hearts, that the red planet maybe, just maybe, may be made of red Georgia clay.  In fact, the computer is named after Mars, the golden retriever owned by Chris and his wife and seen in the photo at left.

<a name="what is it?"></a>
<h2>What is Crop Science?</h2>
Crop science is the study of plants which are used to produce food and fiber for humans and feed for animals.  Modern crop science includes basic and applied courses in a diversity of study areas.  The crop science major allows students flexibility in preparing for careers.  Careful course selection in the first two years permits students to choose from numerous electives during their junior and senior year.  Elective courses in genetics, chemistry, computer science, animal sciences, botany, economics, business, engineering, entomology, plant pathology, and other areas broaden the scope of education.<p><p>

<a name="Practical experiences"></a>
<h2>Practical Experiences</h2>
Many courses in the crop science major include laboratories in which studens obtain experience related to their coursework.  Internships provide practical experience in crops sciences, and students may arrange to recieve course credits for internships.  Part-time or full-time internships may be arranged with experiment stations, businesses, industries, or government agencies.  Scientists in the Department of Crop and Soil Sciences offer work-study opportunities to students to assist in research.  A special problems course in agronomy awards academic credit for experience in research.  Leadership training is provided through the Agronomy Club and other campus activities.<p><p>

<a name="Career Opportunities"></a>
<h2>Career Opportunities</h2>
Career opportunities for crop science graduates are diverse.  Employment opportunities are found in agribusiness sales and service, education, financial institutions, government service, and farming.  Specific areas of employment are agricultural business manager, agricultural chemical sales and promotion, agricultural extension agent, agricultural missionary, farmer, farm manager, international agriculturalist, herbicide specialist, industrial agronomist, and research technician.<p><p>
Qualified graduates may elect to study for the M.S. or Ph.D. at The University of Georgia or other universities.  Undergraduate training in crop science provides a background in basic and applied sciences for graduate training in agricultural and related plant science fields.<p><br>

My research interests are in the area of soybean breeding and genetics.  Presently, I am investigating the genetics of disease, nematode, and insect resistance.  I coordinate a multi-disciplinary effort in soybean breeding to develop highly productive, multiple-pest resistant cultivars for the southeastern U. S.  My approach to increasing seed yield in soybean includes selection for increased canopy photosynthetic rate and nitrogen fixation during the critical seed-fill period.  <p>

     My research addresses sorghum breeding and physiology (particularly mineral nutrition) for stress, tolerance and adaptation in subtropical, humid environments.  The field-oriented breeding program has focused on acid soil stress tolerance and encompasses evaluation of the world collection of sorghum as well as tissue culture regenerants.  Because of the high rainfall, humid environmental conditions, foliar and stalk-rot diseases are being address, particularly anthracnose and fusarium resistance.  Additional research has concentrated on herbicide tolerance in sorghum, especially tolerances related to alachlor, metolachlor, and glyphosate and their relationship to the acid soil tolerance complex.  Finally, cooperative breeding investigations are being conducted on fall armyworm and midge resistance.  <p>

     My research objective is in the development of improved wheat, triticale, and barley cultivars and germplasm for the Southeast. Currently, I am interested in the development of cultivars which are resistant to diseases and insects. Breeding for resistant cultivars is the most economical and environmentally safe method of pest control. Changes in diseases and insect races occur often in Georgia.  Therefore, my program emphasizes durable resistance which remains effective over a longer period of time. Root growth is also an area in which lain particularly interested. Studying root development and growth offers us an opportunity to select plants tolerant of waterlogged conditions, mineral toxicity, and drought stress.  The development of more efficient plants, based on morphological and physiological traits, also provides a way to increase grain yield.<p>

     My research interests are (1) rumen microbial degradation of plant cell walls and (2) structural characteristics that limit forage quality. Specifically, from the microbial perspective, I investigate the colonization and degradation of plant cell types by anaerobic bacteria, protozoa, and fungi. From a plant perspective, I investigate the arrangement of tissues, ulltastructural features of plant walls, and sites and types of lignin and phenolics as related lo forage digestibility. For my research, I employ anaerobic culture methods and microscopic (both light and electron) techniques.  The purpose of my work is to identify and modify factors that will result in improved utilization of forages and reduced costs to producers and consumers.<p><hr>

     My primary research thrust is forage quality. Specifically, I am investigating non-structural anti-quality components of pasture species. This includes studying symbiotic interactions between the fungal endophyte, Acremonium coenophialum, and tall fescue,<i> Festuca arundinacea</i>.  Recently I have discovered that plant/endophyte associations vary in their ability to produce ergopeptine alkaloids, the compounds responsible for the animal condition known as "Fescue Toxicosis."  I am developing monoclonal antibodies specific to the ergopeptine alkaloids so that a sensitive and rapid technique for quantitation is available for use. Congruently, I am conducting investigations between infected and noninfected genotypes in the field and at different locations around the United States. The focus of the research effort is to develop germplasms, populations, and cultivars of tall fescue which retain the benefits of the endophyte but have no toxicity to grazing livestock.<p><hr>

In addition, beef cattle research is concerned with grazing pressure effects on different types of alfalfa, intensive rototional grazing systems, animal selectivity, and systems for stocker cattle production on tall fescue pasture. Other work is centered on development of pearl millet as a new low-input grain crop. Most of my research is cooperative with other scientists and graduate students.<p><hr>

I work with fertilizer application timing, rates, and methods for several agronomic crops grown on the sandy soils of the area.  Since many crops need supplemental irrigation, a special research effort has been to apply fertilizers through center-pivot-systems when nutrients are needed by the plant in order to obtain maximum nutrient-use efficiency.  I also maintain research on tissue and soil analyses for prediction of fertilizer needs.  Current emphasis now includes the utilization of animal manures for fertilization of Coastal Plain crops.<p><hr>

     I am a soil microbiologist with research interests in environmental biotechnology and plant-microbe interactions.  On a long term basis, I am interested in how various genes (actually, gene products) affect the growth and survival of bacteria in soil and the rhizosphere.  This assessment of genes is possible through the use of recombinant DNA technology.  In terms of rhizosphere research, I am investigating (department of collaboration in parentheses) the role of endoglucanase and polygalacturonase in <i>Pseudomonas solanacearum</i> (Microbiolgy; Plant Pathology), the role of alternative nitrogenases in Azotobacter paspali (Biochemistry), and the effect of CS2 evolution by Stryphnodendron excelsum on nitrification and nitrogen fixation (Botany).  In addition, I have collaborative projects on enhancing alfalfa yields in acid soils using acid-tolerant alfalfa germplasm and acid-tolerant <i>Rhizobium meliloti </i>(Crop and Soil Sciences), and developing a nitrification inoculum for fish (Veterinary Medicine).<p><hr>

    My research interests are soil ecology and agroecology.  I am currently focusing on
biological processes that regulate soil structure and organic matter dynamics in natural and agricultural ecosystems.  Of particular interest are the influences of soil organisms on water-stable aggregate formation, a potentially important mechanism for protection of soil organic matter.  My experimental approach combines stable isotope tracers and field manipulations of soil biota to examine this mechanism in agroecosystems under intensive versus conservation management.  This research will contribute to basic understanding of ecological processes in soils and to the development of more sustainable agricultural practices.  I am also developing research projects on ecological processes in low-input and other alternatively managed
agroecosystems.  <p><hr>

     Irrigation has become a critical element in the management of row crops in Georgia.  My research focuses on irrigation-scheduling methodology in humid climates.  This work includes crop growth and water use modeling, crop response to water stress, root development, and water supply and quality.  In related research, I conduct studies of soil physical properties and statistical representation, including geostatistics.  These investigations explain how soils in place impact crop water supply and movement of agricultural chemicals in the root zone.  Our program is conducted primarily in conjunction with field studies in the Coastal Plain region of the state, where more than 90% of Georgia's row crops are produced.<p><hr>

My research deals with understanding the soil properties and processes, as well as the climatic and related factors that affect nitrogen availability to crops, as well as the availability of nitrogen to plants in natural systems.  Research emphasis has been on the development and improvement of simulation models that describe plant availability of nitrogen in these complex systems.  Future research will use information systems such as simulation models, GIS, and GPS, as well as remote sensing to describe the spatial and temporal variation in nitrogen availability on the landscape.<p><hr>

     My research area is broadly the study of colloid chemistry, with applications to soil and water conservation and environmental processes.  Our studies have shown a clear relationship between colloidal behavior (flocculation/dispersion) and the erosion, infiltration, and sedimentation behavior of soils under rainfall in the field, which have led to new insights into the mechanisms and control of infiltration and sediment production.  The use of gypsum and organic polymers to control erosion and runoff appear to be important applications of this work.  Other studies in our lab have dealt with the chemistry of Fe, Al, and trace metals in the soil environment. <p><hr>

My students and I have focused on nitrate leaching from no-tillage and manure systems.  Drinking water with high concentrations of nitrate can cause methemeglobinemia ("blue-baby syndrome") in infants so the goal is to prevent nitrate leaching to groundwater.  We have found that macropores are common in no-tillage soils and that they increase bypass flow.  This may cause greater nitrate leaching if rain occurs just after fertilizer or manure has been applied to the surface.  However, if nitrate has time to diffuse into the soil matrix, bypass flow may result in less leaching.  We have also found that nitrate is adsorbed in the highly weathered soils of our region and this retards leaching.  We have used ground electromagnetic conductivity measurements to show that dairy loafing areas are a source of high concentrations of nitrate in groundwater.  We now have a field experiment comparing nitrate leaching from untreated and composted poultry litter.  We are also using time domain reflectometry (TDR) to measure macropore flow.  I teach Soil Physics and Advanced Soil Physics, and team-teach Soil Contaminants and Graduate Seminar.<p><hr>

My research centers around the soil chemistry of plant micronutrients and toxic metals.  I study the soil properties and processes which affect metal adsorption and release by soils.  I developed a sequential extraction procedure to determine various forms of soil metals and am using the procedure to determine the effects of changes in soil properties on the distribution of metals among fractions, and thereby their bioavailabilities and vulnerabilities to leaching.  My current program emphasizes the interaction of metals with solid and soluble organic materials, both those which are naturally present in soils and those added through organic waste amendments.   Experiments using batch adsorption, column, and fractionation techniques are addressing the dichotomy of forces that results from solid organic matter strongly adsorbing metals and soluble organic matter complexing metals in solution, thereby reducing adsorption.<p><hr>

My research program has three major thrusts: (a) Investigation of anion retardation in highly weathered subsoils. Nitrate leaching contributes to groundwater contamination which can be predicted by various solute transport models. However in highly weathered acid subsoils, nitrate movement is retarded by the positive charge present requiring corrections to me made to the models to account for anion retardation. The relationship between anion transport and soil properties is being studied to develop the required data base to make these corrections. (b) The development of management strategies for the beneficial use of anthropogenic wastes on land. A large variety of waste products such as biosolids, chicken litter and manure, paper and pulp sludges, fly ash etc are being evaluated in terms of the potential benefits which they may have on soil properties such as nutrient status, physical condition and microbial activity. Particular attention is being paid to the environmental consequences such as leaching to groundwater and overland flow to surface waters of potential pollutants resulting from the land application of wastes. (c) The evaluation of industrial by-products as liming materials and soil amendments. Various alkaline materials remaining after product production in the paper and power generation industries are being tested as potential lime replacement sources. In addition, by-product gypsum-containing materials are being investigated as amendments for acid soils and those with poor physical condition. I teach Soil Chemistry and Soil Contaminants.<p><hr>

    My research is divided into three general areas. The first deals with the effects of
landscapes and parent materials on the properties of soils in various regions of Georgia. A large portion of the soils within the state is dominated by low-activity clays, but there is a definite landscape/parent material control in their distribution.  Work is currently underway to ascertain this distribution and the mechanisms controlling it.  The second area deals with soil/parent material/mineralogy effects on water and pesticide movement as related to potential ground water contamination. Current work is attempting to define pesticide sorption characteristics in low-charge subsoil horizons. The third area is related to the macromorphic and micromorphic characteristics of soil surface horizons and surface crusts as related to infiltration and erosion under various treatments and management systems.<p>

<dd>Dairymen and cattlemen across America are using alfalfa grazing systems to increase production.  These producers know grazing alfalfa increases milk and meat production, lowers feed bills and reduces harvest expense. Until now these producers shared a common problem:<br>
     <dd>Getting good hay yields from grazing varieties was difficult and intense grazing severely cut the stand and life of proven hay varieties.<br>

<img align=left src="gifs/joe.jpg">     <dd>But back in 1978, Dr. Joe Bouton, University of Georgia alfalfa breeder, began work to solve this problem.  In a unique 12-year project, he torture-tested over 1,100 alfalfa entries under repeated, intense, carefully monitored grazing pressure - the most extensive animal performance testing ever conducted.<br>  
  <dd> Selections from the last few hardy survivors became the parent plants used to develop a new breakthrough type of alfalfa: Alfagraze.<br>

<img align=right src="gifs/compare.jpg">     <dd> Alfagraze is a one-of-a-kind alfalfa variety.  Specially selected for superior grazing tolerance, Alfagraze features the upright growth habit of conventional hay varieties.  Because Alfagraze is not a creeping nor spreading type, Alfagraze producers have the choice to manage Alfagraze for both grazing and haying. <br>

<dd>Thank you for inquiring to the Crop and Soil Sciences Department and the University of Georgia about our graduate programs.  The Crop and Soil Sciences Department is comprised of 59 faculty members whose research and extension efforts are equally distributed between crop and soil sciences.  Entrance into the Crop and Soil Science graduate program is competitive, requiring minimum grade point averages of 3.0 for M.S. degrees and 3.5 for Ph.D. degrees.  The average GRE scores are 500 on the verbal section and 680 on the quantitative section.  All graduate students are supplied with financial aid in the form of stipends.  The stipends pay $11,500 for the M.S. degree, and $12,500 for students seeking the Ph.D.  All students on stipends receive out-of-state tuition waivers and in-state fee reductions.  Students are responsible for paying incidental fees only, which amount to approximately $700/year.<p>  

<dd>Faculty are located at one of three University locations (Athens, Griffin, and Tifton) and one federal location in Aiken, South Carolina.  In general, research faculty at the Tifton and Griffin campuses are involved in applied research that address farm or environmental issues that are of immediate concern to the state, nation, or both.  Faculty located at Athens and Aiken are inclined to investigate similar issues, however their research is directed towards more basic investigations involving cause/effect relationships or biotechnological solutions.

<title>Requirements for graduate degress in Crop and Soil Sciences at UGA</title>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">


<h1>Requirements for graduate degrees in Agronomy at The University of Georgia</h1>
(Revised December, 1994)
<img src="gifs/line9.gif"><p>
                   
     Admission and general regulations for graduate programs at the University of Georgia are outlined in the Graduate School Bulletin, which should be consulted as the authoritative source for this information.  These guidelines are for the purpose of summarizing important Graduate School policies, and describing specific requirements of the Department of Crop and Soil Sciences. <p> 
<hr>
<h2>I.   Admission</h2>

     The following criteria are used in determining admission to graduate programs in Crop and Soil Sciences:<p>

          <h3>Master of Science Degree</h3>

              Overall grade point average (GPA) of 2.8-3.0* and at least 1000 GRE
               aptitude portion combined score; or<p>

              Overall GPA of 3.1-3.4 and at least 900 GRE aptitude portion
               combined score; or<p>

              Overall GPA of 3.4 or above and at least 800 GRE aptitude portion
               combined score.<p>

         <h3>Doctor of Philosophy Degree</h3>

               Completion of an M.S. program or equivalent and GPA on M.S.
               program of 3.5 and at least 1000 on the GRE.<p>

          <dd>*Based on all courses for the baccalaureate degree and 4.0 = A.<p>

The GRE is required and there will be no exceptions.  For foreign students the quantitative ortion of the GRE must show a minimum score of 500 and the test of English as a foreign language (TOEFL) exam must also show a minimum of 550.<p>

 At least three strong letters of reference will be required for all students.<p>
     
Students will be expected to have an M.S. degree or equivalent from a U.S. college for
admission to the Ph.D. program.  The M.S. degree or equivalent obtained from non-U.S.
universities must be evaluated by the Graduate Coordinating Committee for cceptance.<p>

All admissions are based on a favorable evaluation by the Department Graduate Coordinating Committee and acceptance by the Graduate School of the University of Georgia.<p>

Graduate students who have not made a commitment as to their major professor will be
assigned one when they are accepted by the Department.  These will be tentative assignments subject to change by consent of the major professor, student and Department Head.  Many assistantships, scholarships, etc. are assigned to research program leaders and may not be transferrable to another major professor.<p>

     Graduate enrollment will be based upon space and available appropriate faculty to direct student programs.<p>


<h2>II.  Advisory Committee</h2>

This committee will be proposed by joint consultation between the student and the major professor and approved by the Graduate Coordinator.  Forms for appointment are available from the Graduate Coordinator.<p>

          <h3>M.S. Degree</h3>

         <dd> An Advisory Committee of three or more faculty members will be appointed by end of the first quarter of residence.  This committee shall consist of the major
professor (who must have full or provisional Graduate Faculty Status) and two
          other faculty members (one of whom must have Graduate Faculty status).  This
          committee will approve the student's program of study and thesis plan and
          administer the final oral examination.  The major professor and/or student will
          keep the advisory committee informed of progress being made.<p>

         <h3>Ph.D. Degree</h3>

          <dd>An Advisory Committee of five or more, consisting of the major professor and
          at least four other faculty members, one of whom will be from another
          department, shall be appointed during the second quarter of residence.  The
          major professor (with full Graduate Faculty status) and at least 2 others must
          have Graduate Faculty status (full or provisional).  This committee will approve
          the plan of study and dissertation prospectus and conduct preliminary and final
          examinations.  The student will keep the Advisory Committee informed of
          progress being made.<p>


<h2>III. Program of Study</h2>

         <h3>M.S. Degree</h3>

         <dd>The student shall submit to the Graduate Coordinator through his/her major
          professor a program of study (list of proposed courses) by the end of the first
          quarter of residence.  The program of study must then be submitted to the
          graduate school.  A thesis proposal approved by the advisory committee must
          be submitted by the end of the second quarter.  These items become a
          permanent part of the student's departmental file and record.  The thesis
          proposal is to insure that a student starts early on a research project suitable for
          a thesis.<p>

          <dd>The program of study and thesis proposal must be approved by the Advisory
          Committee.  The program of study will include at least 40 hours of courses at
          the graduate-level, exclusive of AGY 730.  At least 1/2 of the 40 hours will be
          made up of courses open only to graduate students (600-no undergraduates, or
          800 level).  Credit in AGY 700M - Masters Research - may not be applied
          towards this 20-hour requirement.  Five hours each of AGY 700M (Research)
          and AGY 730 (Thesis) must be included on the plan of study; only 5 hours each
          of these courses will count toward graduation.  Only 1 special problems course
          (5 hr.) will be allowed on each program of study.  For seminar requirements see
          Section VIII.<p>

          <h3>Ph.D. Degree</h3>

         <dd>The student shall submit to the Graduate Coordinator through his/her major
          professor a preliminary program of study by the end of the second quarter of
          residence.  This program of study must be approved by the Graduate
          Coordinator.  The plan of study must include 55 hours of course work at the
          graduate level, including 5 hours of 930D (Dissertation).  A maximum of 20
          hours of AGY 900 (Doctoral Research) may be included.  A minimum of 20
          hours of 800 level courses are required in the program of study.  Research skills
          requirement (see below) must be specified, but will not be counted towards the
          55 hour requirement.  A dissertation proposal must be presented by the end of
          the third quarter.  The program of study and dissertation proposal will be
          approved by the Advisory Committee.  The final plan of study must be
          approved by the Graduate Coordinator and Graduate Dean, with any changes in
          courses or committee make-up, prior to admission to candidacy.<p>

<h2>IV.  Special Problems Courses</h2>

          <dd>Special problems courses must be administered, supervised and graded by a faculty
          member other than the major professor of the student involved.  Grades for Crop and
          Soil Science special problems (AGY 821 and 822) will be assigned on U
          (unsatisfactory) and S (satisfactory) basis.<p>

<h2>V.   Research Skills Requirement (Ph.D.)</h2>

     Research skills may be satisfied by one of the following:<p>

          <dd>1.   Statistics 621-622 or a course for which this sequence is a prerequisite.<p>
          <dd>2.   Computer Science 700-733 or 700-702-614 or a course for which one
               of these sequences is a prerequisite.<p>

         <dd> 3.   Reading knowledge of a foreign language.<p>

<h2>VI.  Preliminary Examinations (Ph.D.)</h2>

     <dd>The Advisory Committee will administer both written and oral preliminary
     examinations upon the student completing the foreign language requirement (if foreign
     language option is elected) and 1/2 or more of the course work on the program of
     study.

    <h3> Written Examination</h3>

          <dd>The Advisory Committee will submit written questions to the major professor
          covering the body of knowledge that the Advisory Committee members feel
          appropriate for the individual student.  The examination will be administered by
          the major professor, with examination answers evaluated by the individual
          questioners.  The Advisory Committee may solicit additional questions from
          other members of the faculty.  Advisory Committee members will indicate to
          the major professor whether a pass or fail mark was achieved on exam; 4 out of
          5 positive responses are required to pass.  Failed exams may be repeated at the
          discretion of the Advisory Committee.  The major professor should notify the
          Graduate Coordinator in writing that the written exam has been passed.<p>

  <h3> Oral Examination</h3>

          <dd>Within one month following successful completion of the written examination,
          the preliminary oral examination will be given.  The Graduate School and the
          Crop and Soil Science Department faculty will be notified at least two weeks in
          advance of the time and place of the oral preliminary examination.  Notification
          will be the responsibility of the major professor after approval of the Graduate
          Coordinator.  All members of Advisory Committee are expected to be present
          during the entire oral exam.  Faculty with the rank of Assistant Professor or
          higher are invited and encouraged to attend preliminary oral examinations. 
          Questions may be raised in any area appropriate to the student's training.  The
          members of the student's examining committee will determine if the student
          passes.  At least four out of a possible five positive votes are required to pass. 
          Oral examinations must be taken at least three quarters prior to graduation.<p>

<h2>VII. Admission to Candidacy</h2>

     <dd>The above requirements must be completed before application for admission to candidacy can be filed.  In order to be admitted to candidacy, students must have completed all prerequisites  set as a condition for admission, filed a final plan of study, met research skills requirements, passed prelim exams, and maintained a 3.0 average on courses listed on the plan of study.<p>

    <dd> An M.S. student must apply for admission to candidacy before the end of the first week of
     classes in the quarter in which final courses on the program of study are taken.  A Ph.D.
     student must apply for admission to candidacy at least 3 quarters before the date of graduation.<p>


<h2>VIII. Seminar Requirements</h2>

     Each M.S. candidate will be required to take 1 hour of CSS 810 for credit, and also present
     the results of their thesis research to a faculty seminar.  This seminar must be presented
     immediately prior to the final examination.  Each Ph.D. candidate will be required to take 2
     hours of CSS 810 for credit, and also present results of their dissertation research to a faculty
     seminar.  This seminar must be presented immediately prior to the final examination.  Since
     attendance at seminars is an important part of graduate education, all graduate students are
     expected to attend Graduate seminar (AGY 810), as well as faculty and other special Crop and
     Soil Science seminars.<p>

<h2>IX.  Completion of Thesis or Dissertation and Administration of Final Oral Examination
</h2>

     <dd>A final draft of the thesis or dissertation must be submitted to the Advisory Committee no later
     than<i> three weeks</i> before the final examination.  The draft is one <i>which is approved by the
     major professor</i> as being complete and editorially correct.  The style of the thesis or
     dissertation should be based upon professional journals in the field of study.  The thesis may be
     formatted either in traditional thesis style, or as a series of manuscripts, based on Graduate
     School guidelines.<p>

    <dd> A corrected thesis or dissertation must be supplied to all members of the examining committee
     at least one week before the final oral examination date.<p>

    <dd> Final examinations (M.S. and Ph.D.) will consist of a seminar presentation of the student's
     research, followed by the defense/final exam.  Questioning in the defense will emphasize the
     defense of the thesis or dissertation, but questions may be raised in any appropriate area, and
     particularly in areas where the student did poorly on preliminary examinations.  All members of
     the Advisory Committee must be present during the final examination.  Faculty holding the
     rank of Assistant Professor or above are invited and encouraged to be in attendance at the
     defense/final exam.  The major advisor should notify the departmental faculty of time and place
     of the final seminar and exam.  Four of 5 votes for the PhD, or 2 of 3 for MS, must be positive
     for the student to pass.<p>


<h2>X.   Experience in Teaching and Research</h2>

    <dd> In order to enhance employment opportunities, students should be exposed to a broad
     spectrum of educational experiences in the classroom, laboratory, and field.  All graduate
     students are encouraged to assist in teaching at least one quarter for each degree while in
     residence.<p>

   <dd> Students should also seek to improve their knowledge and experience in various kinds of
     agronomic research.  Such experience may be acquired by working with the major professor or
     another researcher on short projects unrelated to the student's thesis.<p>

   <dd>  In addition to the formal seminars, students are encouraged to participate in informal meetings
     such as "sack-lunch" seminars at which graduate students and faculty discuss research topics,
     procedures and results of their experiments.<p>

<h2>XI.  Requirements and Duties of Graduate Teaching and Research Assistants</h2>

    <dd> Graduate assistantships are awarded to help students support themselves while earning
     graduate degrees and to help the university fulfill its responsibilities in teaching and research. 
     Offers of assistantship are made by the Department Head at request of the Major Professor,
     after approval of admission by the Graduate Committee and Graduate School.  Once an
     assistantship is awarded, the student must make satisfactory progress toward completing
     degree requirements and must satisfactorily perform his/her assigned duties in order to be
     reappointed.   Appointments can only be made for a one-year period, with reappointment for
     subsequent years.  Normal duration of the assistantship is two years for the M.S. and three
     years for the Ph.D.<p>

    <dd> Assistantships may be terminated following any quarter during which the student does not
     maintain a GPA of at least 3.0 or does not perform satisfactorily in assigned duties.  Students
     will be evaluated in writing annually to assess their performance in research and assigned
     duties.  If the GPA of a student falls below 3.0 they will be give a quarter of grace in which to
     bring overall grades up to the 3.0 minimum.<p>

     <dd>Students on regular (1/3) graduate assistantships are expected to work an average of 15 hours
     per week, or the equivalent thereof, over and beyond the work required to earn credit for CSS   700/730 and 900/930 or other courses for which they are registered.  This work may or may
     not be in duties associated with the student's research problem, and may be entirely teaching or
     research, or a combination of teaching and research duties.  In general, graduate students are
     expected to be at work during normal hours of operation of the University.  Students should
     notify their Major Professor of their class and work schedules, and request approval for times
     they will be away from campus.<p>

<h3>Associate Professor<br>

Dr. Leclerc joined the ranks of the faculty at the University of Georgia in 1995.  She was previously an Associate Professor in the Department of Physics at the University of Quebec at Montreal (1990-1995) while being simultaneously an Adjunct Professor at McGill University in the Department of Oceanic and Atmospheric Sciences (1991-1996). In 1988, she was invited to work at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) during her faculty appointment as an Assistant Professor at Utah State University from 1987-1990.<p>

Dr Leclerc has been serving (1991- ) as editor of the International Journal of Agricultural and Forest Meteorology published by Elsevier.  In addition, she is a guest editor for the special issue entitled "Physical and Biophysical Processes in the Vegetation Environment" of the same Journal.<p>

Dr Leclerc is interested in the transport of gases to and from the vegetation.  She is also looking at the transport of gases, energy and heat inside vegetation canopies. Her interest in vegetation-atmosphere exchange stems from the fact that the diffusion of gases such as carbon dioxide, water, sulfur dioxide is regulated by both source/sink strengths of those gases and also to a large degree by the structure of the turbulent flow present within the vegetation canopy. Dr Leclerc has been using a combination of field micrometeorological measurements and modeling to describe the turbulent exchange and the gaseous diffusion in the vegetation environment.<p>

<H1>Turfgrass Research at the UGA Rhizotron</H1> 

<img src="gifs/line9.gif"><p>



<img align=right src="gifs/root.jpg"><dd>Although a gradual increased interest in root or whole plant research is occurring, a great void  still exists. Very little is known about the typical seasonal root behavior of most turfgrasses under actual field conditions. This is particularly true when one considers root behavior or response to specific types of environmental conditions or cultural practices. It is believed that before maximum growth and quality of turfgrasses can be fully realized, we must understand each species in totality--roots and shoots and how they are affected as a plant system by the environment and commonly used turfgrass management practices.<br>
 
 <img align=left src="gifs/gallery.jpg"><dd>  To accomplish this total understanding, it is essential that turfgrass root systems be studied non-destructively, while growing under actual field conditions. One method in which this can be accomplished is through the use of underground root observation laboratories or rhizotrons. Such a facility was constructed at the University of Georgia in 1985. A rhizotron is an underground walkway lined with a series of soil compartments or cells having transparent windows. Root observations are made along the face of the window while the aerial parts of the plants under study are exposed to field environmental conditions. Rhizotrons permit detailed, non-destructive monitoring of plant root systems throughout the entire year. They allow the investigator to record important root growth and behavior information such as growth rates, rooting patterns, initiation, maturation, senescence and other detailed morphological responses that are usually inaccessible.  With this information,relationships can be developed between overall root and shoot responses a they relate to environmental and/or cultural practices.<p><p>

<h2>3.  Transformation:</h2>
<img align=right src="images/gus2.jpg">

<strong>Shooting:</strong> A transformation system has been developed by using microprojectile bombardment.  Two plasmids are simultaneously introduced into the target tissue.  This allows transformation with any  gene of interest without the need for subcloning.  Over 10,000 GUS-expressing foci were typically obtained after bombarding 500 mg of tissue.   Evidence of transient GUS expression can be see on the picture on the right.

<strong>Selection:</strong>  Hygromycin selection (10 mg/l) is applied to suspension cultures one week after bombardment.  The hygromycin concentration is increased to 20 mg/l after one week.  The selection medium is changed after one week and on a  weekly basis thereafter.

<h2>6.  Desiccation:</h2>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Comments: </strong> Dessication may be as simple as placing several embryos in an empty Petri dish, sealed with a micropore tape, for at least 7 days or until dry, depending on the genotype.  The actual number of embryos in the dish depends on the size of the embryos, but enough need to be placed in the plate to maintain a high humidity.  If the embryos are small, and too few are placed in the dish, the embryos will dry out too quickly.  This can be prevented by adding 1-2 cc of solidified medium to the plate.

These are leaves from a peanut plant infected with the TSWV .  We have recovered cell lines (cv. VC1) containing an N gene from either of two strains of TSWV isolated from peanut.  In all, over 600 stably transformed cell lines were recovered from 13 g of tissue shot.  Plantlets regenerated from these cell lines express the N gene, and have been recently established in soil.

<h2>Carbohydrate metabolism</h2>
<img align=left src="images/mannitol.jpg" width=200 height=237>
At left is an HPLC printout from a peanut cell line showing the production of mannitol.  We are working with compounds that could alter the flavor of peanut and/or displace the oil content of the seed.  Besides the <i>mtlD</i> gene for mannitol synthesis, we are also working with the <i>sacB</i> gene for the production of fructan.  We recovered approximately 100 stably transformed cell lines (cv. VC1) from 1.5 g of tissue shot with the<i> mtlD</i> gene, and over 250 cell lines from 1 g of tissue shot with the <i>sacB</i> gene.  We are in the process of recovering somatic embryos from the transgenic cell lines.  In all cases, the transgenics were recovered by shooting with a 1:1 molar ratio of the plasmid containing the desired gene and a plasmid containing either <i>hph</i> or <i>bar</i> as a selectable marker.  Approximately 80-90% of the cell lines recovered contain both plasmids.  A manuscript is under preparation.<p>

<H1>The mission:</H1>
<image SRC= "images/line31.gif"><P>

<STRONG>The <a href="http://stratsoy.ag.uiuc.edu/~usb/welcome.html">United Soybean Board (USB)</a> has recognized that before the benefits of soybean genetic engineering can be fully realized in agriculture and science, soybean engineering must become much more efficient than it currently is.  Currently, most university laboratories and small agricultural biotechnology companies do not possess the ability to produce genetically engineered soybean.  Consequently, the number of genes which plant breeders and other scientists need to engineer into soybean vastly exceeds the available engineering capacity of all the soybean laboratories in the country.<p>  

To address this need, the United Soybean Board has established this Center to bring together the expertise of three principal investigators with extensive backgrounds in soybean regeneration and genetic engineering, so that they may pool their expertise to develop and refine one or more complete genetic engineering systems for soybean, with the final goal that genetic engineering can become routine and affordable for use in soybean improvement. The Center has been in existence since January 1, 1995, and is still formulating its research approaches.  As the Center develops better soybean regeneration and transformation technology, this capacity will be available to all soybean scientists.  Once the technology has become established, the longer-term goals for the Center will be to ensure that engineering technology for soybean continues to improve, and to introduce agronomically important genes into soybean, either from our programs or from those of other soybean scientists.<p>

<h1>Somatic Embryogenesis</h1>

<h4>Somatic embryogenesis is the process of obtaining embryos from somatic plant tissues.  Somatic embryogenesis is useful as a way for 1) large-scale propagation of plants, 2) the production of synthetic seed, and 3) as a target for genetic engineering.  We study their induction and growth through globular, heart, torpedo, and cotyledonary stages [seen above], after which they must be matured and desiccated before they germinate into plants.  We have developed protocols for somatic embryogenesis of <a href="somprot.htm">soybean</a> and <a href="peanut3.htm">peanut</a>, which we then use to <a href="sb_se_tr.htm">genetically engineer</a> these crops.</h4>

The exact size of the immature seed depends somewhat on the final size of the seed.  Soybean genotypes vary widely in seed size.  A good rule of thumb is to use immature seed in which the embryo is still a light, translucent green.  Once the embryo changes to a darker, more opaque green, it is no longer embryogenic.  Embryos should begin to appear after the second week.  After 4-6 weeks on this medium, many of the embryos become repetitive.

		Embryos which have gone repetitive on MSD40 medium can be transferred successfully to MSD20 medium where by they proliferate successfully with monthly subculture.  After a 1-month passage on MSD20 medium, they may be successfully transferred to FN or FN Lite media, whereby they require biweekly subculture to fresh medium.  Regardless of medium, the selection of embryogenic tissue during each subculture is essential.

Globular-stage embryos from either step 1 or step 2 above give rise to cotyledonary-stage embryos upon removal of the auxin.  A week on this medium is usually necessary, and embryos may remain on this medium up to a month without detrimental effects.

	<li><h3>Comments:</h3>
		Cotyldon-stage embryos from the step 3 may be separated individually, and transferred to MSM6 medium for their maturation.  When the embryos reach physiological maturity, they lose their green color, and acquire a creamy yellow color.  This usually happens 6-8 weeks after embryos first reach the cotyledon stage.  Embryos which have not lost their green color after this time period can also be taken on to the next stage.

<ul>
	<li><h3>Comments:</h3>

Dessication may be as simple as placing several embryos in an empty Petri dish, sealed with a plastic wrap, for 3 to 7 days, depending on the genotype.  The actual number of embryos in the dish depends on the size of the embryos, but enough need to be placed in the plate to maintain a high humidity.  If the embryos are small, and too few are placed in the dish, the embryos will dry out too quickly.  This can be prevented by adding 1-2 cc of solidified medium to the plate.  Alternatively, the embryos may be placed in an unsealed dish, which is in turn placed in a chamber containing a saturated KCl solution, which will provide about 85% relative humidity.
</ul>

</ul>

	<li><h3>Comments:</h3>

At this point, photoperiod becomes critical to prevent the premature induction of flowering.  A 23-hour photoperiod is very effective for this.  Once seedlings have visible shoot and root formation, they may be transferred into Magenta boxes for further growth, then transplanted into soil, hardened off, and taken to a greenhouse.  Once the plants have reached the desired size, the photoperiod can be reduced to permit flowering and seed set.

<P> <B>Course Description</B></P>

<P> A study of weeds and weed control methods in agronomic crops with emphasis
on chemical weed control. Herbicides will be discussed with regard to use,
chemical structure, selectivity, mode of action, and dissipation.</P>

<P> Three examinations and a comprehensive final examination will be given
during the quarter. The first exam will count for 50 points. Exams II and
III count for 100 points. The final examination will count for 150 points.
Seven weekly quizzes will be given that will be worth 15 points each for
a total of 105 points. The laboratory will count for 215 points or 30%
of your total grade. A total of 720 points can be earned.</P>

<P> The grading scale will be:</P>

<P> A = 648 points and above</P>

<P> B = 576 - 647 points</P>

<P> C = 504 - 575 points</P>

<P> D = 432 - 503 points</P>

<P> F = 431 and below.</P>

<P> Exams and quizzes will be taken from <I>lectures and assigned readings</I>.</P>

<P> I do not curve grades and do not give extra credit. You will get the
grade <I>you</I> earn ! </P>

<P>Required Text: <I>Fundamentals of Weed Science</I> by Robert L. Zimdahl
(1993, Academic Press). The laboratory manual and <I>Weeds of Southern
Turfgrasses</I> will be available from University Bookstore.</P>

<P> Additional readings will be available on reserve in the Science Library
on 2 hour reserve. These readings will include weed identification manuals
and additional information on herbicide classes. Class notes and old exams
and other material pertinent to the class will be available from a web
page devoted to the class (http://www.uga.edu/)</P>

<H2>El fondo de esta pgina</H2>
<H4>El fondo de esta pgina consta de uno de los pocos grabados de un loro elaborado por los maya.  Este es parte de un hueso que fue grabado durante el perodo clsico tardo en Tikal, Guatemala.  El loro es un pasajero en una <a href="canoe.htm">canoa</a> que tambin lleva gente y otros animales.  Este grabado ha sido el sujeto de varias (mis)interpretaciones a travs de los aos.  Antes se pensaba que era parte de una escena en la cual los Dioses Remeros llevaban a un rey muerto al otro mundo.  Ahora se piensa que es una escena que hace falta en el <em>Popol Vuh</em>.  Los Gemelos Hroes derrocaron a los seores de Xibalb, quienes haban decapitado a su padre.  Luego le restauraron la cabeza al padre, as resucitndolo como el Dios del Maz/Primer Padre.  El hueso tallado consta de los Dioses Remeros llevndo en una canoa que sirve de metfora para la va lctea, a un lugar cerca de la constelacin de Orin (que era una tortuga en el zodaco maya).  All el Primer Padre coloc las tres piedras de la creacin para crear el mundo actual.

<H2>About the page's background</H2>
<H4>The background on this page is one of the few depictions of a parrot made by the Maya.  This particular carving, made on a bone, dates from the Late Classic period in Tikal, Guatemala.  The parrot is a passenger on a <a href="canoe.htm">canoe</a> along with people and other animals.  This carving has been the subject of many (mis)interpretations over the years.  It was once thought to be a scene whereby the Paddler Gods were taking a dead king to the after life.  Current thought is that it depicts a scene missing from the <EM>Popol Vuh</EM>. After the Hero Twins have defeated the lords of Xibalb (the underworld), they restored the head of their dead father, thereby resurrecting him as the Maize God/First Father.  The bone depicts the Paddler Gods taking him in a canoe, as a metaphor for the Milky Way, to a spot near Orion (a turtle in the Maya zodiac), where the First Father laid the three hearth stones of creation, thus creating the present world.  For more details on this, read <EM>Maya Cosmos</EM>, by <a href="http://www.mecc.com/MAYA/Expert.bios/DavidFreidel.bio.html">David Freidel</a>, <a href="http://www.mecc.com/MAYA/Expert.bios/L.Schele.bio.html">Linda Schele</a>, and Joy Parker, and you will read, IMNSHO, one of the best accounts of scientific discovery ever written.

<P>
<P>
It's as interesting now as it was back in 1845.  Things haven't changed that much -- we're keeping Scientific American as vibrant as it always was, with the introduction of this new online edition.  
</P>
<P>
Here, on the World Wide Web, we are creating a new publication that pushes Scientific American into the frontiers of publishing in an electronic medium.  Just as Scientific American has tracked key changes in technology for the past 150 years, we are now participating in the radical transformation driven by computer technology.  
</P>
<P>
We invite you to take a look.  Each month, we will bring you the best of the <A HREF="../currentissue.html">current issue</A> -- augmented to take advantage of the unique capabilities of the WWW.  You will find many of your favorite magazine features here, as well as at least two major articles in their entirety, with links that let you connect directly to the researchers and their work.
</P>
<P>
You will want to keep coming back often.  Scientific American on the WWW will be more than a showcase for the current issue.  This site will include a number of features updated weekly and available only to readers of the Scientific American Online edition.
</P>
<P>
Each week we will track the breaking new stories and provide readers with links to related sites.  Called <A HREF="../explorations/110496explorations.html">explorations</A>, these features will guide online readers through the overwhelming wealth of information on the Internet.  By linking to other relevant WWW sites and historical sources from Scientific American,  readers can take a guided tour of recent technological developments.  We will provide background, links to directly related information and key insights into the investigators themselves.  Draw your own conclusions about the newest discoveries of the day.
</P>
<P>
We will also be featuring <A HREF="../content.html">interviews</A> with scientists in the news and query experts in any discipline to answer readers' questions about science and technology in a section called <A HREF="../askexpert/index.html">ask the experts</A>.  And if you are interested in gifts -- from books and puzzles to T-shirts and CD-ROMs -- visit the <A HREF="../marketplace/mrktindex.html">marketplace</A>.
</P>
<P>
This is also a place to communicate with our editors and sales people.  You may send us a <A HREF="../forms/editorletterform.html">letter</A>, <A HREF="../marketplace/mrktsubscription.html">subscribe</A> to Scientific American, or <A HREF="../insidesciam/insidesubservices.html">report</A> address changes or other matters concerning your subscription.  Please sign our <A HREF="../forms/guestbook.html">guestbook</A> and tell us a little bit about yourself and your interests.
</P>
<P>
What you see here is just the beginning.  We will be adding other weekly features that further explore the world of technical  and scientific achievement.  And as new possibilities for communication on the Web develop, we'll make them an integral part of  what you can find here.  We hope you will become a regular visitor to this site --  we'll be working very hard to ensure that you always find something new and exciting.

The Internet, as everybody with a modem now knows, has fallen victim to its own success. In a few short years, it has gone from being the communications province of scientists and engineers to a primary route of information exchange for everyone from financial analysts to fashion designers. So much clutter and traffic snarl the computer networks that the Clinton administration has announced its intention to build a new, separate system--the Internet II--just so that scientists can get some work done again.
<P>
Putting the Net to work for the rest of us will be the real challenge in the years ahead. Electronic mail and even videoconferencing are already entrenched, but those applications do not cut to the heart of what the World Wide Web and the rest of the Internet constitute a gigantic storehouses of raw information and analysis, the database of all databases. Worries about the future of the Net usually center on the delays and access limitations caused by its overburdened hardware infrastructure. Those may be no more than growing pains, however. The more serious, longer-range obstacle is that much of the information on the Internet is quirky, transient and chaotically "shelved."
<P>
In the pages that follow, noted technologists tackle questions about how to organize knowledge on the Internet with the aim of making it more genuinely useful. From a variety of standpoints, they consider how to simplify finding the information we desire (yes, there is life beyond today's search engines). They discuss the best ways to format and display data, so that everyone (including the blind) has maximum access to them, in as many ways as can be imagined. The creative technological solutions that they propose may not be the approaches that are finally adopted, but their ideas will certainly provoke further awareness and constructive thinking about the problems.
<P>
Bringing a measure of organization and structure to an inherently fluid medium like the Web may help realize the 18th-century French encyclopedists' vision of gathering together all the world's knowledge in one place. Two centuries later Vannevar Bush, the U.S. director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development during World War II, proposed the memex, a desk containing a micro-film reader and stores of film that would serve as the equivalent of an entire research library. The memex would allow different items in the microfilm collection to be linked together and annotated by the reader. Bush's ideas influenced Ted Nelson, who conceived of the hypertext system that was ultimately fashioned by others into the Web. The same intellectual dynamism is on view in the articles in this special report.
<P>
The authors, perhaps members of a new generation of encyclopedists, sketch a technological pathway that might take the Internet a step toward realizing the utopian vision of an all-encompassing repository of human knowledge. In this conception, the Internet will become a place where the musings of Homer, Shakespeare and Lao-tzu will reside just a mouse click away from school lunch menus and agendas for the next city council meeting--a permanent record of all human activity, from the high-minded to the mundane.

MATERIALS SCIENCE

<center><H2>BETTER RED<BR> THAN DEAD</H2>

<B>An inexpensive new test instantly<BR> spots harmful <I>E. coli</I></B><P>
</center>

<P>In the eternal struggle between humans and microbes, certain toxic strains of
<I>Escherichia coli</I> are the special forces of the bacteria world. Swift and
potentially deadly, they produce toxins that cause intense intestinal distress,
severe dehydration and internal bleeding. No treatment has been proved
consistently effective against the disease, public health officials say. And at
present, no specific, convenient test is routinely used to detect the bacteria,
which kill as many as 200 people every year in the U.S. alone. To test for the
bacteria, samples that have been taken from food or from a patient who may be
afflicted must be cultured for 24 or more hours, after which the harmful
organisms can be detected with microscopes or special dyes.

<P>An invention at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory promises to change all
that. Researchers in the lab's Biomolecular Materials Program have created an
advanced thin-film biomaterial that functions as a litmus test for the bacteria.
The plastic strips, which researchers say could be produced for less than a penny
apiece, instantly change from blue to red in the presence of any toxic strain of
<I>E. coli.</I> It could change the rules of the game," asserts Jeffery Kahn, a
laboratory spokesperson.

<P>Toxic <I>E. coli</I> bacteria are particularly dangerous to young children and
the elderly, possibly because their immune systems are less robust. The most
recent publicized outbreak of the bacteria, in Scotland last December, caused 12
deaths and several hundred cases of illness. A massive episode in Japan last
summer killed a number of schoolchildren and affected some 9,000 others. Such
publicized outbreaks, however, may actually be only a small subset of a much
greater epidemic whose victims generally do not realize what has afflicted them,
some public health officials believe. According to a recent estimate by the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, <I>E. coli</I> 0157:H7--the most
common toxic <I>E. coli</I> strain by far--may be responsible for at least 20,000
cases of illness annually in the U.S. Various studies have found that harmful
<I>E. coli</I> strains may be present in anywhere from 0.1 to 3.7 percent of the
raw meat sold in the U.S.

<P>These strains secrete a toxin that binds to a type of protein molecule, known
as a receptor, on the surface of the cells that line the wall of the intestine.
This toxin damages the cells and eventually leads to intestinal bleeding. It can
then enter the bloodstream and, in the most serious cases, damage the kidney.

<P>To build their <I>E. coli</I> detector, the Berkeley group, led by Raymond
Stevens, duplicated the intestinal cell-surface receptor molecule and joined it
to an underlying backbone." This backbone, which had been developed previously
at the lab by Mark Bednarski and Deborah Charych, is a long chain of linked lipid
molecules that together constitute what is known as a polydiacetylene film, which
happens to be blue. But the binding of <I>E. coli</I> toxin to the other part of
the molecule (the cell-surface receptor) breaks the links joining the lipids to
one another, changing the color of the film to a reddish magenta.

<P>The sensitivity of the test scheme is limited mainly by the ability of the
human eye to distinguish color shades. Most people can easily see a color change
triggered by <I>E. coli</I> concentrations in the low parts-per-million range,
Stevens says. Such sensitivity is ample for most practical applications, but much
greater sensitivity could be obtained by using a spectrophotometer to detect
color change, he adds. Such a configuration might be used in a meat-processing
plant or some other industrial setting.

<P>The test film could be manufactured inexpensively enough to be incorporated
into packaging materials--the wrap used for meat or the lids of jars or
cans--without adding significantly to their cost, according to Stevens. And as of
early January, a number of firms had already expressed interest in licensing the
Berkeley lab's patents and turning the film into a commercially available
product. The phone has been ringing off the hook," Stevens reports.

<P>In the meantime, the Berkeley group has begun exploring other uses for the
technology. With the appropriate receptor molecules, the films could be used to
detect almost any kind of harmful microbe, from those in biological weapons to
influenza viruses. In fact, a flu detector has already been fabricated and did
detect the virus in saliva from an infected student, Stevens notes. Discussions
are under way with the U.S. Army about products to detect botulinum toxin and
anthrax, two common biological agents.

SIZE="2"><B>SIMULATION OF METAL</B> exposed to shock waves, showing the growth of
gaps, is a key element of the DOE stockpile stewardship.</FONT></TD>

<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=336>

To those who handle nuclear weapons--and to anyone within several hundred
kilometers of them--two questions are paramount. First, will a warhead, having
been trucked around from one stockpile to another for 20 years, go off
accidentally? Second, will it explode as intended when used in anger? The
physicists at the U.S. Department of Energy's weapons laboratories responsible
for certifying that hydrogen bombs are both safe and reliable have not been able,
since 1992, to check their calculations by either damaging or detonating one
underground. If the Senate ratifies, and India reverses its opposition to, the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty signed by the U.S. last September, they may never
be able to do so again. How will they know for certain?

<P>The DOE's answer, a plan called science-based stockpile stewardship, is to use
the fastest supercomputers yet devised to simulate nuclear explosions along with
all the important changes that occur to weapons as they age. The plan has stirred
vigorous debate among arms-control advocates, military strategists and, most
recently, university researchers, over whether the approach is cost-effective,
feasible and wise.

<P>The DOE expects that stockpile stewardship will cost about $4 billion a
year--$400 million more than the DOE's annual weapons budget during the cold war,
according to Christopher E. Paine, a nuclear arms analyst with the Natural
Resources Defense Council. The agency intends to spend more than $2 billion on
new experimental instruments, including the <A HREF="http://www-lasers.llnl.gov/lasers/nif.html">National Ignition Facility.</A> These
devices will attempt, using lasers, x-rays and electrical pulses, to measure how
bomb components (except for the radioactive pits) behave in conditions similar to
those in a nuclear explosion. Another $1 billion or so will go to the <A HREF="http://www.llnl.gov/PAO/NewsReleases/July96/ASCI.html">Accelerated
Strategic Computing Initiative</A> (ASCI) to buy three supercomputers, each of a
different design, and to develop computer models based on, and tested against,
experimental data. "This level of simulation requires high-performance computing
far beyond our current level," the ASCI program plan asserts, because "these
applications will integrate 3-D capability, finer spatial resolution and more
accurate and robust physics."

<P>Paine and others question that necessity. "Do we really need three machines?"
he asks. "After all, the labs, using their existing computers and software, have
certified that the nuclear stockpile is currently safe. ASCI presumes that we
will detect problems never seen before that require much higher simulation
capabilities to resolve. That is unsubstantiated. In fact, the data suggest that
weapons become safer with age." They also grow less likely to detonate on
command, however.

<P>Robert B. Laughlin, a professor at Stanford University who has worked on
bomb-related physics at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory since 1981,
worries that "computer programs can only simulate the stuff you know. Suppose you
left a personal computer out in the rain for a year. Is there a program that can
tell you whether it will still run? Of course not--it all depends on what
happened to it." Likewise with nuclear warheads, he says: "Changes happen over
time that you are not sure how to measure. Some matter, some don't. The problem
is the things you didn't think to put in the simulation."

<P>Indeed, skeptics note, some previous attempts to simulate very complex
systems--such as the behavior of oil surfactants, the Ariane 5 rocket and plasma
fusion reactors--failed to forecast the outcome of field tests, at great cost to
those who relied on the simulations. The software codes developed since the 1950s
to predict whether bombs will mushroom or fizzle "are full of adjustable
parameters that have been fit to [underground test] data," Laughlin reports. "If
the new codes don't match the old ones that correctly predicted experiment
results"--and Laughlin bets that they won't--"the designers will simply throw
them out."

<P>To minimize the uncertainty in its models, the DOE is looking to academic
engineers for help. In December the agency offered to sponsor two to five
university research centers with up to $5 million a year and supercomputer access
for each. "The goal isn't to get them to do our job," says Richard W. Watson, who
is managing the program at Lawrence Livermore, "but to establish in the
scientific community confidence in simulation as a valid third arm of science
alongside theory and experiment." Although researchers will be allowed to publish
all their work--none will be classified--the DOE is asking specifically for
projects that focus on areas, such as material stress and the interior of stars,
that are not too distant from its weapons work. (Most academic institutions
generally forbid their staff from conducting weapons and other classified
research on university time.)

<P>Most schools have responded enthusiastically--of 10 contacted for this
article, all planned to submit preliminary proposals. Some of the eagerness may
reflect an imminent consolidation of National Science Foundation funding to the
four federal supercomputing centers. "If one center were cut off, ASCI would be
there," concedes Malvin H. Kalos, director of the supercomputer center at Cornell
University. But many scientists welcome the intellectual challenge as well. "This
is exciting because the scale of simulation they want is mind-blowing," comments
Arvind, a professor of computer science at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. Stitching chemical models together with physical and mechanical
models to simulate, from first principles, an entire combustion chamber or star
(or H-bomb) "will require a lot of difficult fundamental research. But these are
absolutely tractable problems," he says. "This is not at all like Star Wars. Even
if we cannot achieve the ultimate goal, every inch of the way we will be learning
things that will have dramatic positive side effects."

<P>On the whole, according to Howard K. Birnbaum of the University of Illinois,
ASCI is "a great advance over stewardship based on physical testing of weapons.
Will these new computational approaches be used to design new weapons?" he asks.
"Perhaps they will. But it is unrealistic to expect that these will achieve
weapons' status based on simulation alone."

<P>There is debate on that point--and its implications for the test ban. "The
labs, for example, have used their existing computers to modify the B-61 bomb to
fit a new case that will burrow into the ground before detonating," Paine points
out. "They are going to put this into the stockpile without ever testing it."
Pakistan or India, he suggests, could be forgiven for suspecting that the five
major nuclear powers, which asserted for years that testing was critical to
maintaining deterrence, have now advanced beyond the need for nuclear tests. All
the more reason, perhaps, for them to oppose the treaty.

<P>Finally, there is the matter of proliferation. "With underground testing, the
U.S. could keep the lid on most of the technical information," Paine notes.
Information technology, in contrast, ows more easily from one country to
another. Fortunately, observes Srinivas Aluru of New Mexico State University, "it
is virtually impossible to create meaningful simulation systems without access to
data" from real explosions. "But if the Manhattan Project taught us anything, it
is that no technology remains a secret very long," says Michael Veiluva of the
Western States Legal Foundation. "In 20 or 30 years, when five or 10 industrial
states may have access to this technology, one can envision a world in which
nobody is exploding nuclear bombs but in which lots of states are designing and
testing new weapons, with horrific verification problems." Perhaps that safety
question should be simulated as well.

<CENTER><H2>RONALD L. GRAHAM</H2>

<B><I>Juggling Act</B></I></center>

<P><A HREF="http://www.research.att.com/info/rlg/">Ronald L. Graham,</A> chief scientist at AT&T Labs Research, begins with two
balls, flipping them into the air with one hand while casually chatting with a
visitor. He grabs another ball off a counter, and another, while noting that the
world record for juggling is nine balls. He can do six consistently, seven
"playing around." Nodding at a photograph on the wall showing himself juggling 12
balls, he reveals that it is an illusion generated by his daughter, Che, a
photographer who specializes in digital doctoring.

<P>Settling into a chair to give himself more vertical room, Graham juggles five
balls, occasionally shifting the pattern, his hands a blur. His ground-level
office here in Murray Hill, N.J.--adorned with a tabletop rock garden through
which a minuscule stream burbles, a sheet of Chinese ideograms, a print of M. C.
Escher's Night into Day--has too low a ceiling for six.

<P>As Graham is fond of saying, "Juggling is a metaphor." Each of these white
silicone balls could refer to a different aspect of his life, except that an
accurate representation would require far too many balls. As a manager at AT&T
Labs Research, which he joined 35 years ago when it was still called Bell
Laboratories, he has nurtured some of the top mathematicians and computer
scientists in the world. His work in number theory and other realms of
mathematics earned him the prestigious Polya Prize in 1972 and membership in the
National Academy of Sciences in 1985.

<P>He carries a crushing load of other professional commitments. He is a
part-time professor at Rutgers University and gives lectures and seminars around
the world. He is highly active in the American Mathematical Society and the
National Academy of Sciences, and he sits on the editorial board of 40--yes,
40--mathematics and computer journals. He served during the past two years on a
high-profile National Research Council committee on cryptography, which last
December issued a 750-page report recommending less restrictive U.S. regulation
of encryption.

<P>Graham's nonmathematical feats are equally diverse. He is an expert juggler
and gymnast, who at the age of 61 can still do a triple somersault on a
trampoline and a one-armed handstand on a swiveling pedestal. Over the past few
decades he has mastered Ping-Pong (he is the former champion of Bell Labs),
bowling (he has two perfect games under his belt) and Mandarin (he says he can
pass himself off as Chinese in telephone conversations).

<P>Cabinets just outside Graham's office are crammed with skill-challenging
tchotchkes: an adult-size pogo stick, a unicycle, a spherical chess game, a box
of so-called aperiodic tiles that, when properly fitted together, can cover an
infinite plane with patterns that never quite repeat themselves. Graham pulls out
a mutant basketball whose asymmetrical center of gravity makes it difficult to
spin on a finger. "It's a constant battle," he murmurs as he gets the ball up and
whirling. Graham makes it look easy.

<P>Indeed, Graham's most impressive feat may be that he does not come across as
the type-AAA person that at some level he must be. Tall, slim and sandy-haired,
with a ready smile and a soft, tenor-pitched voice, he is the essence of
easy-goingness. In conversation, he meanders from topic to topic, segueing
seamlessly from the implications of Gdel's theorem to the psychological perils
of gymnastics to the secret of his successes. The best way to crack a complex
problem, he confides, whether a triple somersault or a conundrum in graph
theory--is to "break it down into component parts, learn each of the parts and
learn how the parts go together."

<P>Only rarely does Graham offer a glimpse of the forces that compel him. The
death last September of one of his closest friends, the legendary Hungarian
mathematician Paul Erdos (pronounced AIR-dish), has made him more cognizant of
how little time he has to learn new skills, solve new problems. He has considered
making a memento mori, he says, out of a piece of graph paper with 100 squares on
a side, 10,000 squares in all: "Every day you come in, make an X in that square."
He draws an X in the air and then pauses, as if pondering an invisible sheet
before him. Chances are, he adds, that he would not finish filling in the sheet.

<P>Graham's history demonstrates that mathematicians can sprout even from the
most apparently infertile soil. He was born in Taft, Calif., 100 miles northwest
of Los Angeles, where his father worked in the oil fields. Young Ron's family
kept moving back and forth across the country as his father switched from one job
to another, mostly in shipyards.

<P>Although he never stayed longer than two years at any one school, Graham
nonetheless displayed a prodigious appetite and aptitude for mathematics and
science. When he was 15 years old, he won a Ford Foundation scholarship to the
University of Chicago, which had a program for gifted youths. On the small side
for contact sports, he enrolled in a school program called Acrotheater, which
taught students gymnastics, juggling and trampolining. (Graham is now 6 ft. 2
in., "huge" for gymnastics.) "We did shows throughout the year at high schools to
show what a fun place the University of Chicago really is," he says.

<P>After Graham had spent three years at Chicago, his father, worried that the
university was too leftist, convinced him to transfer to a "nice, all-American
school," the University of California at Berkeley. Graham enrolled there as an
electrical engineering major, but after only one year, concerned that he might be
drafted, he enlisted in the U.S. Air Force.

<P>Shipped to Alaska, he worked as a communications specialist at night and
attended classes full-time at the University of Alaska at Fairbanks during the
day. On fulfilling his tour of duty, he returned to Berkeley and obtained a
graduate degree in mathematics. In 1962 he joined Bell Laboratories, where he
quickly rose through the managerial ranks while still pursuing his own research.

<P>One of Graham's abiding mathematical interests is Ramsey theory, conceived
almost 70 years ago by the British mathematician Frank P. Ramsey. "Complete
disorder is impossible: that's the guiding philosophy of Ramsey theory," Graham
says. "In any large, apparently disordered structures there are smaller, more
well behaved substructures."

<P>Problems in Ramsey theory are sometimes posed as "party puzzles." How many
people must be invited to a party to ensure that a given number all know one
another or are all mutual strangers? Finding the so-called Ramsey number becomes
extraordinarily difficult as the number of guests increases. In 1993 two
mathematicians established that the Ramsey number for a party with at least four
mutual acquaintances or five mutual strangers is 25; the proof required a
calculation that consumed the equivalent of 11 years of computation by a
workstation.

<P>It is still unclear whether Ramsey theory will prove to be useful (even to
Martha Stewart). But areas of mathematics that seem utterly impractical, Graham
points out, often turn out to have significant applications. Number theory, which
was the subject of Graham's Ph.D. thesis and was once the "purest of the pure,"
is now a vital part of cryptography. Many encryption schemes exploit the fact
that although multiplying two 100-digit numbers is relatively easy (at least for
a computer), factoring one is mind-numbingly hard.

<P>On the other hand, Graham adds, "it may be that just around the corner there's
some great new idea" that would make factoring large numbers easy. Some experts
think quantum computing, in which the bizarre properties of the quantum realm are
harnessed to accomplish feats beyond the capability of conventional computers,
may represent such a breakthrough. "That's one of my main jobs right now, to help
foster this very far-out speculative thinking," Graham remarks.

<P>The most forceful fosterer of Graham's thinking was Erdos, whom Graham calls
"one of the great problem posers of all time." They met in 1963, and their first
joint paper appeared in 1972. Graham maintained an "Erdos room" in his house for
his mentor, who never had a family or steady job but traveled around the world
staying with friends.

<P> A 1979 paper by Graham helped to popularize the concept of an "Erdos number,"
which reflects a mathematician's degree of separation from Erds. Those who have
co-authored papers with Erds have the Erdos number one, those who have
co-authored papers with a member of this group but not Erdos himself have the
number two, and so on. To Graham's surprise, a similar game has recently
flourished on the Internet, in which people try to name the movies connecting the
actor Kevin Bacon to other show-business personalities.

<P>Graham has little difficulty switching from mathematics to other activities,
in part because mathematics is connected with so much of what he does. For
example, many of the 3,000 members of the International Jugglers Association, of
which Graham once served as president, are involved with math or computers, and
juggling has inspired some ingenious mathematics [see "The Science of Juggling,"
by Peter J. Beek and Arthur Lewbel; <I>Scientific American, </I>November 1995].

<P>Moreover, Graham's closest collaborator lately is Fan Chung, a professor of
mathematics at the University of Pennsylvania whom he married in 1983. (A
previous marriage produced Graham's two children, Ch and Marc.) The two recently
tackled a problem related to the routing of calls through a telephone network. An
ideal way to prevent calls from converging on the same route and thus exceeding
its capacity is to assign calls to routes at random, but achieving true
randomness is tricky. Chung and Graham have shown that most of the benefits of
randomness can be obtained with "quasirandom" methods that are much easier to
design and deploy.

<P>Graham and his wife also just improved on a conjecture first posed by Erdos
and a colleague back in 1935. The conjecture held that the number of points on a
plane required to generate a convex polygon with n sides is a hideously
complicated function of n + 1, or <I>f(n)</I> + 1. "We got rid of the plus one," Graham
says happily.

<CENTER><B>INTERACTION-FREE MEASUREMENTS</B></CENTER>

<P> A question immediately sprang to mind after reading "Quantum Seeing in the
Dark," by Paul Kwiat, Harald Weinfurter and Anton Zeilinger [November]: Don't the
findings presented in the article contradict the Heisenberg uncertainty
principle? I always thought the uncertainty principle meant that, at an atomic
level, it is impossible to measure something without interacting with it. Yet the
authors' clever techniques seem to get around this theory. 
<P> <I> PHILIP
SLACK</I><BR> Bolinas, Calif.

<P> Kwiat, Weinfurter and Zeilinger write that interaction-free measurements can
take place when a mirror "pebble" is placed in a photon's path during an
Elitzur-Vaidman experiment. It may be true that the photon received at the
detector did not reflect off the pebble, but it is not accurate to say that there
has been no interaction. The interaction is evidenced by the collapse of the
photon's wave function when it begins behaving like a particle. In effect, the
pebble takes a measurement of the photon. 
<P> <I> JOLAINE ANTONIO</I><BR> Calgary,
Alberta 

<P><B><I> The authors reply:</I></B> 

<P> Slack's suggestion that interaction-free measurements seem to violate Heisenberg's uncertainty principle is insightful: we
have consulted with other experts in our field, but no completely satisfactory
answer has been forthcoming--a sign that it is a very interesting question. We
all believe there is no conflict with the uncertainty principle, but the precise
mechanism by which this comes about is less than obvious. One hint is that the
interaction-free measurements work efficiently only if the mirror "pebble" starts
off localized to a region about the same size as the interrogating light beam.
<P> Antonio is correct that for the detector to be able to receive the photon, there must be the possibility that the pebble can absorb the photon. But as quantum physicists, we should restrict our statements to observable quantities. In this sense there is no interaction, because we do not observe any change in the state of the pebble--not even when the pebble is a quantum object--whenever the interaction-free measurement succeeds. Intuitively, this fact is clear because the photon took the path without the pebble.

<P>In an article entitled "Alpine Glacial Features of Mars," published in the
July 6, 1973, issue of the journal Nature, four Garden City High School
students--Jeff Kasold, Marilyn Suda, Peter Metcalf and Stephen Caccamo--and I
described aretes (sharp, glaciated ridges), cirques (glacially carved,
semicircular features), U-shaped valleys and horns (glaciated mountain peaks) on
the surface of Mars. These formations are also clearly depicted in the enhanced
NASA photograph of glaciated mountain features included in the article "Global
Climatic Change on Mars," by Jeffrey S. Kargel and Robert G. Strom [November].
Our article from 24 years ago also addressed climatic change on Mars: we wrote
that "the alpine glaciers responsible for the erosion of the features described
herein could have recently disappeared because of a warming trend that did not
eliminate the polar ice caps."

<P><I>JULIAN KANE</I><BR> Hofstra University

<P><B><I>Kargel replies:</I></B>

<P>My hat goes off to Kane and his co-authors for having pointed out long ago
that there are features on Mars that can be interpreted as being of glacial
origin. I was not previously aware of this interesting paper. In my opinion, the
areas of Mars studied by Kane's group, Cavi Angusti and Cavi Frigores, were
formed by erosion because of sublimation of ice rather than the direct action of
glaciers, as Kane and his colleagues suggest. The fact is, planetary scientists
do not know for sure what these fascinating features are. We await what we hope
will be spectacular images from the Mars Global Surveyor.


<HR><CENTER><B>DYSLEXIA</B></CENTER>

<P>I was very interested by Sally E. Shaywitz's article on dyslexia [November]. I
wonder if she has determined whether people born deaf were subject to the same
phoneme blockage that she describes and whether children learning to read
Chinese--in which sounds are not represented by characters--have similar
problems.

<P><I>DEAN O. CLIVER</I><BR> University of California at Davis

<P><B><I>Shaywitz replies:</I></B>

<P>People born deaf do experience more difficulties in learning to read than do
nonimpaired people. Congenitally deaf people do use phonetic coding during
reading: they show sensitivity to the phonetic structure of words, access
phonological information rapidly and can even indicate when nonsense words
"sound" like real words. Such awareness of phonology could be acquired from
experiences in lip reading or making articulatory gestures in speaking.

<P>Contrary to many assumptions, most Chinese characters have a phonetic
component. Estimates suggest that as many as 50 percent of Chinese characters
depend on the phonetic component for word identification. Furthermore, in
Chinese, just as in English, good readers can be distinguished from poor readers
based on their relative efficiency of phonologic processing.

<BR><B>MARCH 1947</B>

<P>"The problem of giving automatically reproduced form letters that individually
typed look has found a solution in a device called the Flexowriter Automatic
Letter Writer. Operated by means of a perforated paper tape 7/8-inch wide, it
consists of an electric typewriter, an automatic perforator and an automatic
writer. In preparing the form letter, the operator types manually the date and
the name and address of the recipient. Then a switch is thrown, and the automatic
writer takes over, controlled by the previously prepared tape."

<P>"Fouling of lenses and other optical parts of instruments used in the tropics
was until recently a serious problem, particularly in the Pacific areas. The way
this hindrance was checked has now been revealed. Metal foil is treated with
radium compounds to give it an alpha-ray emission equivalent to about 15
micrograms of radium per square inch, and narrow strips of the foil are mounted
around the lenses."


<P><HR>

<BR><B>MARCH 1897</B>

<P>"In a recent lecture before the American Geographical Society, Mr. Heli
Chatelain made some very startling statements regarding the extent and horrors of
the slave trade in Africa. Let no one suppose that the slave trade in Africa is a
thing of the past. In this great continent, which the European powers have
recently partitioned among themselves, it still reigns supreme. 'The open sore of
the world,' as Livingstone termed the internal and truly infernal slave trade of
Africa, is still running as offensively as ever. Among 200,000,000 Africans,
50,000,000 are slaves. In the islands of Zanzibar and Pemba alone, which are
entirely governed by Great Britain, 260,000 are held in bondage. For each slave
that reaches his final destination, eight or nine are said to perish during the
journey, so that the supply of 7,000 slaves annually smuggled into Zanzibar
represents the murdering of some 60,000."

<P>"Honey bees gather, with great avidity, the maple sap from troughs in the
'sugar bush.' The bees' labors are but half performed when the liquid has been
collected; it must be 'boiled down,' so to speak, to reduce it to keeping
consistency, and the wings are the only means by which that toilsome process is
performed. As in the absence of blotting paper you sometimes blow upon the newly
written page to promote evaporation, so by the vibrations of their wings the bees
pass air currents over the honey to accomplish the same result."

<P><HR>

<BR><B>MARCH 1847</B>

<P>"Among all the new inventions and discoveries  that are astonishing the world,
we have heard of none which promises to be more useful and acceptable, at least
to ladies, than 'The Essence of Coffee,' which is now offered to the lovers of
that beverage. It is the genuine stuff, put up in bottles, at a low price. You
have only to put a tea-spoon full into a cup of water containing the usual
complement of sugar and milk, and you have a cup of superior coffee without
further trouble."

<P>"Caoutchouc (india rubber) becoming very smooth and viscous by the action of
fire has been proposed by an eminent English dentist, as an excellent remedy, for
filling hollow teeth, and alleviating the toothache proceeding from that defect.
A piece of caoutchouc is to be melted at the flame of a candle, and pressed while
warm into the hollow tooth. In consequence of the viscosity and adhesiveness of
the caoutchouc, the air is completely prevented from coming into contact with the
denuded nerve."

<P><center><IMG SRC="IMG/039750100.gif" "WIDTH="330" HEIGHT="311" BORDER="0">
<br clear=all><FONT=2><B><I>The Speaking Automaton</I></B></FONT></center>

<P>"Our engraving is a representation of Professor Faber's celebrated Speaking
Machine, which is now in England. The Automaton is a figure like a Turk, the size
of life. Connected with it is a series of keys, or rather pedals; and by pressing
these down, in various combinations, articulate sounds are produced. We tried it
with the following words, which were produced by Mr. Faber as fast as we
suggested them: 'Philadelphia,' 'tres bien,' and 'God bless the Queen,' which
last sentence it concluded with a hurrah and then laughed loudly. The chief
organs of articulation are framed of India rubber, and a pair of bellows are
substituted for the lungs."

<I>by Shawn Carlson</I>

<P>I used to spend my days (and I do mean my days) hunting for supernovae. The
astrophysics group I worked for dusted off an old 30-inch telescope, then used
only for teaching, and converted it into a fully automated research instrument.
When night arrived, this computer-controlled marvel woke up, checked its systems
and set about the business of discovery. On clear nights it scanned hundreds of
galaxies, searching for objects that appeared as bright stars not detected in
earlier images. Sometimes it found them.

<P>It was wonderful! And I didn't feel too guilty about not freezing all night in
a remote observatory. I had toiled in cyberhell for months teaching the
telescope's computer how to decide which galaxies to image and in what order it
should observe them. Because large excursions from horizon to horizon sent the
telescope's 40-year-old drive system into shock, it was vital that the feeble old
veteran be moved as little as possible. That meant ordering the galaxies into a
sequence that, totaled over the whole night, required the telescope to move
through the smallest possible angle. Computer aficionados will recognize my
galaxy conundrum as a variant of the classic traveling salesman problem, in which
a huckster seeks an itinerary that will let him travel the smallest possible
distance through a list of cities.

<P>The problem of minimizing the telescope's motion appeared intractable. There
are nearly 10375 different ways to sort 200 galaxies-a fairly typical evening's
caseload for our telescope. (For you math types, 10375 is 200 factorial.) To find
the one way of ordering the galaxies for a search that put the absolute least
strain on the telescope, we would have had to check every possible ordering.
Unfortunately, this job could not be accomplished even by all the world's
supercomputers working day and night for <I>sextillions</I> of years.

<P>For most real-world problems, a solution that comes within a few percent of
the ideal one is quite acceptable. Fortunately, computer scientists have devised
an algorithm that can find such solutions to many seemingly impossible problems.
This amazing algorithm enables ordinary laptop computers to come up with these
solutions in just a few minutes, making it a powerful addition to any amateur
scientist's tool kit.

<P>Called simulated annealing, this algorithm is a remarkable melding of human
cleverness and natural efficiency. A mathematical physicist named Nicholas
Metropolis and his co-workers developed the procedure back in 1953, but it has
only recently come into wide use. Metropolis's procedure was later used to find
useful solutions to traveling-salesman-type problems by mimicking on a computer
the natural process by which the crystal lattices of glass or metal relax when
heated. This process is called annealing.

<P>Although the procedure is modeled on annealing, the relevant fundamentals are
the same, and perhaps a bit more easily explained, for crystal growth. The
molecules in a solution of hot sugar water wander about randomly. If the
temperature drops quickly, the sugar molecules solidify into a complicated
jumble. But if the temperature drops slowly, they form a highly ordered crystal
that can be billions of times larger than the individual molecules.

<P>With each molecule not only immobile but also at its lowest possible energy
level in the crystal's lattice, this crystal is in its minimum energy state. (It
corresponds, in my problem, to the galaxy ordering that demands the least
movement from the telescope.) The system naturally progresses toward this minimum
in a rather unexpected and remarkable way. The molecules are naturally
distributed over a range of kinetic energies. As the temperature cools, the
average kinetic energy drops. But some individual molecules remain in high-energy
states, even when most are moving slow enough to bind to the crystal. When the
lower-energy molecules get "hung up," they often bind in states with excess
energy rather than in the lowest-energy states where they belong.

<P>The higher-energy molecules, however, can "knock" these trapped molecules out
of these overly energetic bound states and into states of lower energy. This
energy transference from molecule to molecule allows the molecules to
redistribute themselves as the uid cools, thereby nudging the growing edges of
the crystal in such a way that the molecules settling into them can find the
minimum energy state. This orderly crystal growth occurs only during a slow
cooling because a lot of time is needed for the molecules to find the
lowest-energy state.

<P>So what does all this have to do with the traveling salesman problem? To use
Metropolis's procedure, you must be able to describe your problem as a search for
a sequence. In the traveling salesman problem, for example, the problem is to
determine the best order in which to visit the cities on a list. With a little
cleverness, a great many problems can be formulated in this way. It is also
necessary for you to be able to generate a number that tells how well any given
sequence works; the better the solution, the smaller this number must be. This
number is analogous to the energy of the crystal in the crystal-growth example.
For my supernovae search problem, the sequence was the order of galaxies
searched; the quantity analogous to energy was the total angle through which the
telescope had to move.

<P>The <A HREF="0397amscibox.html">box</A>  outlines the algorithm. It works by calculating the energy levels
represented by different sequences, or "paths." If a new sequence has a lower
energy than the previous one, the program always adopts it. Returning to the
crystal-growth example, a lower-energy path corresponds to one or more molecules
finding their way into a position of lower energy in the lattice. But what about
a higher-energy path? Here is where it gets interesting. The program does not
immediately reject higher-energy paths; after all, the dislodging of a molecule
trapped in a higher-energy state in a lattice is an example of a higher-energy
path, and such occurrences are the heart of the procedure.

<P>Yet not all higher-energy paths are likely to nudge the system into a
lower-energy state. To determine which ones do, the procedure uses the so-called
Boltzmann probability distribution. This factor determines the probability of
finding a system, such as a molecule or a group of molecules, with a certain
energy <i>E</i> at a given temperature <i>T</i>. When applied to simulated annealing, this
probability turns out to be the number e (a constant, equal to about 2.7183, that
comes up often in physics and other fields) raised to the power (-<font face="Symbol">D</font>E/<font face="Symbol">k</font><i>T</i>), where <font face="Symbol">k</font>
is Boltzmann's constant, which relates temperature to energy, and <font face="Symbol">D</font><i>E</i> is the
energy difference between the two paths. A clever trick allows the list to be
altered without requiring the energy to be recalculated from scratch every time.
The alteration begins by randomly selecting some subsection of the list. Then,
either the order of the subsection's elements is reversed, or the subsection is
moved and reinserted somewhere else in the list at random. In either case, the
energy associated with the subsection does not change. The energy changes only
where the subsection joins the rest of the list.

<P>Simulated annealing isn't the only algorithm that mimics nature to solve
complex problems. So-called genetic algorithms simulate evolution at the genetic
level to create cyberorganisms that are themselves solutions to research problems
[see "The Amateur Scientist," July 1992]. Neural networks-which simulate the
activity of neurons in the brain to store information, learn from experience and
do calculations-are another field of intense research.

<P>All this brings up a fascinating point. Nature is far more clever than humans
will ever be. Simulating on a computer nature's methods of organizing and
creating has already produced extraordinarily powerful tools to fell some of our
own most vexing computing problems. Despite this, only a handful of nature's
solutions have yet been duplicated on a computer. There simply have to be more
out there to borrow from. The tricky part is in recognizing which systems to
model and in realizing the kinds of problems that our simulations can solve.

<P>So keep your eyes open! Perhaps, while contemplating ripples of turbulence in cigarette smoke, investigating how individual bees organize themselves into a hive or studying the simultaneous turns of a flock of birds, you will discover the next major innovation in computer problem solving.

"Is it possible, as urban legend has it, for a tarantula to lay eggs inside a cactus?"
</A></B></FONT>

<P>--<I>Brendan O'Malley<BR>New York, NY</I>
Barbara H. Reger, president of the <a href="http://www.cowboy.net/~spider/ATS.html" TARGET="_top">American Tarantula Society</a>, responded in good humor:

<p>"I was amused by your inquiry, because this question is asked of me several times a year. 
No, it is quite improbable that this would ever occur. Tarantulas living in dry desert regions 
where cactus are found do often burrow at the base of the cactus, but not inside it. The sharp 
prickly spikes would harm them, and the conditions there are inappropriate for laying eggs. 

<p>"The following paragraphs are quoted from an article, 'Detonating Cactus Yields Tarantula 
Shrapnel,' I wrote in the FORUM of the American Tarantula Society, Vol. 2 No 2, 1993:

<p>"Have you heard the one about the lady whose neighbor bought a cactus at her local garden 
center? When she got it home and watered it, the thing swelled up and exploded, raining baby 
Tarantulas down all over the place. She called an exterminator, but he offered very little hope. 
The poor woman actually had to sell her home and move. 

<p>"Or, did you hear the one about the woman whose brother's best friend brought a cactus back 
from Arizona? He had it for a year. Every time he watered it the thing grew larger and larger. One 
day it suddenly exploded, and baby tarantulas went everywhere. They called an exterminator who 
told them that he received numerous calls weekly because this same thing has been happening all 
over the city. 

<p>"For the past three years, I have been running into people that have given me variations of this 
same story. They look me up because they know I study tarantulas. What's really amazing is how 
angry or offended they get when I explain to them that the story is not true. They feel like I am 
calling them a liar. I tell them to please get the name for me of the person that claimed this 
happened. They can never come up with a name. They always say that it wasn't their neighbor's 
friend, is was a friend of a friend, etc. I even try to explain to them that spiderlings could not be 
living in a cactus and still develop properly as the cactus was watered time and again. I even 
explain the way a tarantula constructs its burrow in the desert. They won't listen because they 
are too enamored with the idea of being offended.

<p>"The first time I encountered this story it involved the parent of one of my students. She said 
her neighbor had purchased the cactus at Frank's Nursery and Crafts. I called this local store, and 
they said they had already received numerous calls on it. They told me it wasn't their store, but the 
one on the north side of the city. I called this store and was sent on a wild goose chase all over 
Indianapolis and then throughout the state. Actually, Frank's buys their cacti from a nursery in 
Canada. We all know how many tarantulas live there! This rumor got so bad in Indianapolis that the <I>Indianapolis Star </I> printed an article about it and how rumors and tall tales tend to use 
pseudo-witnesses to add validation to their stories. 

<p>"I'm sure you all have variations of this story too. At least now, armed with my copy of the 
article from our local paper, I can prove to people that it is indeed a rumor. Well, actually, I 
should say I can show people that others have heard the same story. Scientific evidence of any 
sort doesn't seem to satisfy them, they still are offended by being demonstrated silly and will 
not have it any other way."

<p>Fred Sherberger of <a href="http://www.fernbank.edu/fsc2.html" TARGET="_top">Fernbank Science Center</a> in Atlanta, who is the associate editor for the American Tarantula Society, 
offered some further comments:

<p>"This one of those things that you hear all the time that simply is not true, like the 'fact' that grasshoppers make sounds by rubbing their legs together. But it isn't true--grasshoppers don't do 
that. Katydid males rub their wings together. In other cases, the insects may rub a wing and a leg together (which makes a musical sound) or they may snap open the back wings (which creates 
more of a snap-crackle-pop noise).

<p>"There's a basic logical flaw in the tarantula story. Once tarantulas lay their eggs, the baby 
tarantulas do not get any nutrient other than what is present in the egg; when the tarantula hatches, 
it cannot be any larger than the eggs it hatched from (just like a chick emerging from a hen's egg). 
So what would make the cactus explode? And I always hear of a cactus exploding--you never hear 
of an oak tree being torn asunder by hatching tarantulas.

<p>"It's hard to say why this story is so persistent. Perhaps people see the egg sack of a house 
spider and then later see big clump of spiders in the same place. You might wonder, gee, how did 
all those spiders come from that little sack? But in fact you are not looking just at the mass of the bodies; you are seeing them all spread out after they have hatched. I find it hard to believe that 
logical people believe the story is true. Mostly, people probably repeat the story because it is 
cute and funny. That's how I look at it--I laugh and say, oh no, not again!"

"What would be the effect on life if a supernova exploded close to the earth? 
If it were at the distance of the closest star, would a supernova be able to sterilize the planet?"
</A></B></FONT>

<P>--<I>P.K. Birkmeyer<BR>Hampton, Va.</I>

<p><a href="http://astro.princeton.edu/~richmond/" TARGET="_top">Michael Richmond</a> in the department of astrophysical sciences at Princeton University responds:

<p>"The primary danger to life on the earth from a <a href="http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/pubinfo/leaflets/supernovae/supernovae.html" TARGET="_top">supernova</a> would be the high-energy radiation (x-rays and gamma rays) produced by the radioactive decay of elements synthesized in the explosion. There are two types of supernovae: massive stars that run out of fuel in their cores and collapse (called 'Type II' or 'Type Ib' supernovae), and white dwarf stars that accrete enough material from a close companion to undergo runaway thermonuclear fusion (called 'Type Ia' supernovae). Both kinds of supernovae create radioactive nickel 56, which decays into cobalt 56, emitting gamma rays as it changes; the cobalt 56 then decays into iron 56, releasing additional gamma rays. As the gamma rays fly through the debris ejected during the explosion, they collide with nuclei and electrons and transfer some of their energy to these particles. Nevertheless, a very large amount of high-energy radiation makes its ways through the ejecta and escapes into space.

<p>"Our sun emits high-energy radiation, too, most notably during a solar flare. A supernova puts even the largest solar flare to shame, however, producing more dangerous radiation in a single second than a year's worth of continuous solar flares. If a supernova were as close as Alpha Centauri, the nearest star system (4.3 light-years away), it would dump as many x-rays into the earth's atmosphere as 1,000 simultaneous solar flares, and it would continue doing so for several months. It is possible that the earth's atmosphere would not be able to absorb all this radiation and that some fraction might reach the ground, bombarding unprotected creatures with lethal doses of x-rays.

<p>"Fortunately, the stars that might become supernovae are extremely rare; there are no such stars within at least 10 parsecs (one parsec is 3.26 light-years) of the earth, and there are probably none within 100 parsecs. Because the intensity of radiation decreases in proportion to the square of the distance, we are in no danger from more distant explosions."

<p><a href="http://www.kingsu.ab.ca/~brian/brian.htm" TARGET="_top">Brian E. Martin</a>, an associate professor of mathematics, physics and astronomy at the King's University College in Alberta, Canada, offers another perspective:

<p>"It never fails: whenever I give a public talk or lecture to freshmen and the topic leads to supernovae, a hand shoots up and someone asks, "What would happen if our nearest stellar neighbor went supernova?" This is an excellent question and can be used to uncover a lot of basic physics. So let's consider the following scenario: We are situated one parsec away from a Type Ia supernova. Are we toast? Sad to say, yes! 

<p>"First, let's look at the optical effects. Supernovae come in two basic flavors: Type I are the result of the detonation of a mass-accreting white dwarf in a binary system; Type II supernovae are the end games of massive, single stars. Type I are the more energetic of the two and can, briefly, outshine their parent galaxy. Astronomers use absolute magnitude (M) as a measure of the intrinsic brightness of an object; absolute magnitude is defined as the brightness that the object would have at a distance of 10 parsecs. Type I supernovae have absolute magnitudes on the order of 19 (at the same distance, the sun would have a magnitude of 4.8; the difference of 24 magnitudes means that a Type I supernova is about three billion times brighter!). If such a supernova occurred only one parsec away, we can use the 'distance modulus formula' (m  M = 5 log[r/10]) to estimate the apparent visual magnitude (m) of the object. The supernova would not quite rival the sun (magnitude 24 for the supernova versus 26.7 for the sun) but would be clearly visible during the day as an intense point of blue-white light about one tenth as bright as the sun. Such a supernova would produce a marvelous sight--two suns in the sky--and would have significant effects on the climate. But as we shall next see, it is unlikely anyone would be around to marvel at the spectacle!

<p>"Gamma-ray-burst effects will be the big problem. The optical emission from the supernova comes from the rapidly expanding photosphere (equivalent to the visible surface of the sun) of the exploding star as it hurtles at thousands of kilometers per second into interstellar space. It will brighten for several weeks and then begin a more gradual denouement. Meanwhile, however, one of the most violent energy bursts known will have already taken place. As the star explodes, a shock wave wells up from the core and crashes through the photosphere with ferocious violence, triggering a burst of gamma radiation. Estimates put the energy emitted by this shock on the order of 5 x 10<sup>47 </sup>ergs (which is about equal to the sun's entire output at all wavelengths for three million years!). The entire event will take a mere 10 microseconds or so. As the radiation floods into interstellar space, the earth will suffer a fatal blow. At a distance of one parsec, our upper atmosphere would be subjected to a gamma-ray intensity of about four billion ergs per square centimeter. The result would be intense ionization of the molecular nitrogen and oxygen in the air and the production of ozone-depleting nitrous oxide (NO) compounds. This chemical stew would almost certainly destroy the ozone layer (some researchers estimate that the 'lethal limit' for ozone-layer destruction is on the order of several million ergs per square centimeter). 

<p>"With our protective ozone layer gone, we would be in grave danger. First, harmful ultraviolet rays from the sun would begin to irradiate the planet. More significant, however, would be the steadily growing background of x-ray and gamma radiation from the supernova. As the supernova expands outward, radioactive heavy elements produced in the explosion would begin to decay, sending high-energy radiation into the surrounding space. Most significant is the nickel-cobalt-iron chain of radioactive decay, which would produce a steady supply of lethal radiation for at least the next year. The <a href="http://ledas-www.star.le.ac.uk/ginga/ginga.html" TARGET="_top">Ginga</a> x-ray satellite noted a flux of hard and soft x-rays from supernova 1987A; the observed intensity was about 4 x 10<sup>-11 </sup>ergs per square centimeter per second for a period of over a year. Supernova 1987A exploded in the Large Magellanic Cloud, about 50,000 parsecs away. At a distance of one parsec, the x-ray flux would climb to about 0.2 erg per square centimeter per second, which is on the order of magnitude of the x-ray emission from a large solar flare. But unlike a solar flare, which may last for a few seconds to a few minutes, the supernova emissions will persist for months to years--after the earth has lost the protective benefit of the ozone layer. If this happens, we are indeed toast!

<p>"I hope I have convinced you that a supernova explosion at one parsec is not a good idea. In fact , it is likely to be worse than I indicated, because I did not even mention the possible harmful effects that could be produced by the normally unnoticed neutrinos that are emitted in copious profusion during a supernova or by the x-rays from the newly forming supernova remnant. Even at a distance of 1,000 parsecs, a supernova could probably produce serious effects on the earth. In the 1970s astrophysicist Malvin Ruderman suggested (see the article by M. A. Ruderman in <I>Science</I>, Vol. 184, page 1079;1974) that the mean time between close encounters with supernovae--those at a distance less than 1,000 parsecs--is on the order of 60 million years. Interestingly, the dinosaurs went extinct 65 million years ago. Is this number a coincidence?  

<p>Juan I. Collar of CERN (the European Organization for Nuclear Research) near Geneva, Switzerland, offers yet another view, focusing on some recent research:

<p>"Prompted by the identification that the Geminga gamma-radiation source (located approximately 200 light-years away from the solar system) is a supernova remnant, astronomers John Ellis and <a href="http://rainbow.uchicago.edu/physics/t_astro.html#Schramm" TARGET="_top">David N. Schramm</a> revisited the possible effects on life of a nearby supernova explosion [see "Could a Nearby Supernova Explosion Have Caused a Mass Extinction?" J. Ellis and D. N. Schramm in <I>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA</I>, Vol. 92, No. 1, pages 235-238; January 3, 1995]. For a supernova roughly 10 parsecs away, the researchers estimated that the increase in the cosmic-ray-induced radiation dose would not by itself be catastrophic for most organisms. They did find, however, that the ionizing radiation would produce nitrous oxide (NO) in the atmosphere at a rate that guarantees the destruction of the ozone layer for 300 years or so, shutting down photosynthesis in marine plants and wreaking havoc on the global ecology. Fortunately, Ellis and Schramm estimated that this cataclysmic episode should take place only once every 100 million years or so. In principle, it should be possible to find evidence of such a nearby supernova explosion by looking for isotope anomalies in the geologic record [see "<a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/9605128">Geological Isotope Anomalies as Signatures of Nearby Supernovae</a>." John Ellis, Brian D. Fields and David N. Schramm in <I>Astrophysical Journal</I>, Vol. 470, No. 2, pages 1227-1236; October 20, 1996].

<p>"Not every stellar collapse necessarily leads to a supernova. Some theorists have suggested that stellar collapses can also take place in a more 'silent' manner, in which case the resulting energy emission would be almost only in the form of neutrinos. These silent collapses would be less conspicuous than supernova explosions and could easily have been overlooked; it is possible that they occur more frequently in our galaxy than the usual 'loud' collapses. The prevalence of silent collapses will be elucidated in the coming years by current and upcoming neutrino experiments [see the page on <a href="http://snodaq.phy.queensu.ca/SNO/experiments.html" TARGET="_top">Neutrino Experiments</a> from Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario]. The large flux of neutrinos from a nearby silent stellar collapse might still be hazardous to life: the energetic neutrinos could cause so many mutations (by inducing nuclear recoils in genetic material) to cause grave damage to living things [see "<a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/9505028" TARGET="_top">Biological Effects of Stellar Collapse Neutrinos</a>." J. I. Collar in <I>Physical Review Letters</I>, Vol. 76, No. 6, pages 999-1002; February 5, 1996].

<p>"The closest stars to the solar system are the three members of the Alpha Centauri system. They sit only 4.3 light-years (1.3 parsecs) from the earth, and if one of them were to explode as a supernova or undergo a silent collapse, the effects on the biosphere would be catastrophic. Luckily, none of them has nearly enough mass for this to happen!"

"What is known about the nature and diagnosis of Tourette's syndrome? Do we know what causes it, and can it ever be cured?"
</A></B></FONT>


<P>--<I>Debbie Eckardt<BR>Eugene, Ore.</I>

<P>We ran a <a href="http://www.sciam.com/askexpert/011397medicine.html#acs72">brief
response to this question</a> several weeks ago. Now <a
href="http://cbdb1.nimh.nih.gov/staff/weinberg/dan.htm"TARGET="_top">Daniel R. Weinberger</a>,
chief of the <a href="http://cbdb1.nimh.nih.gov/">clinical brain disorders
branch</a> at the National Institute of Mental Health, has written with
additional information and references:

<P>"Tourette's syndrome is a curious medical condition defined by a constellation of
involuntary behavioral manifestations involving abnormal movements and
utterances. The abnormal involuntary movements, called motor tics, are
repetitive, stereotyped movements, usually of the face and neck. In most cases,
they are simple and brief, such as eye blinking, neck jerking, lip smacking or
protruding of the tongue. Occasionally the movements are more complex and involve
motor routines, such as bending over and touching one's toes or sniffing one's
fingers. The utterances, called vocal tics, are also usually brief, stereotyped
and repetitive--for instance, throat clearing, snorting, sniffing or grunting. In
rare instances, the vocal tics can be complex and involve involuntary repetition
of whole phrases, such as parts of the speech of others (echolalia), and swearing
(coprolalia).

<P>"Although the tics of Tourette's syndrome are involuntary, they are under a
certain degree of conscious control and can be suppressed for varying degrees of
time. Interestingly, most affected individuals notice that the longer they
suppress their tics, the more they feel an urge to release them. This compulsive
quality to the manifestations led Gilles de la Tourette, the 19th-century French
neurologist who described the condition, to refer to it as 'tic compulsif.'

<P>"In virutally all cases, Tourette's syndrome begins in childhood, usually before
the age of 10. It is a fairly common disorder, occurring in approximately five
out of every 10,000 people. This prevalence rate probably underestimates the
frequency of milder forms of the disorder, which involve only motor or only vocal
tics. Common tic phenomena, such as nervous throat clearing or smacking of the
lips, probably represent in many instances milder forms of Tourette's syndrome.
In general, the degree and manner of tics tend to vary over time, often being
worse during stress or illness. The condition is usually lifelong, but many
individuals experience some reduction in the severity of their symptoms as they
grow into adulthood. Tourette's syndrome is almost never physically disabling.
Most individuals learn to compensate for their symptoms or to accept them as part
of their lives and require no or only occasional treatment. The psychological and
social aspects of the malady, which can be considerable, represent its main
burden.

<P>"The cause of Tourette's syndrome is unknown. Throughout much of this century, it
was regarded as a purely psychological condition, but it is now known to be
neurological in origin. Family studies and studies of twins have confirmed that
there is a genetic basis for the disorder, although the gene or genes have yet to
be identified. There is no diagnostic laboratory test for Tourette's syndrome,
nor are there unique features that show up in neural imaging techniques, although
there are subtle abnormalities in certain brain structures (for example, the
caudate nucleus) and neurochemical systems (dopamine, for instance) that have
been associated with the disorder. How these findings contribute to the clinical
manifestations of the condition is a matter of much speculation.

<P>"It has become increasingly clear that Tourette's syndrome is more than just
movements and noises. Many patients also experience the intrusion of involuntary
compulsive thoughts and feel the urge to perform repetitive, often illogical
acts, such as repetitive counting, checking and hand washing. These
obsessive-compulsive symptoms also run in the families of patients with
Tourette's syndrome and have led to the belief that the gene or genes underlying
the disorder are related to the gene or genes for obsessive-compulsive disorder.
The brain regions that have been implicated in Tourette's syndrome also overlap
with those that have been linked to obsessive-compulsive disorder. Hence, the two
syndromes appear to represent varying manifestations of a common neurobiological
spectrum.

<P>"The treatment of Tourette's syndrome is based on the degree of symptoms and
distress that individuals experience. Drugs that diminish dopamine activity in
the brain (such as haloperidol, pimozide and risperidone) are effective for
treating the tics. Serotonin reuptake inhibitors, which are used to treat
depression, are also effective in ameliorating the obsessive-compulsive
manifestations. Unfortunately, these drugs are not entirely free of side effects,
and some individuals find the side effects less tolerable than the tics.
Psychological counseling and support groups are often helpful in learning to cope
with the social and psychological ramifications of the disorder.

<P>"For most patients with Tourette's syndrome and related tic disorders, the course
of treatment is benign and the outcome is good. Future prospects for
understanding the basic causes of the disorder and for developing more effective
treatments are promising. One of the most important reasons for this optimism is
the public education effort and research support of the <a
href="http://neuro-www2.mgh.harvard.edu/TSA/tsamain.nclk">Tourette's Syndrome
Association</a> in Bayside, N.Y. The work of this lay organization has had an
enormous impact in reducing the stigma associated with Tourette's syndrome and in
making research about this disorder a priority of the biomedical research
community."

"How can the extremity of a whip travel faster than the speed of sound to produce the characteristic "crack"?"
</A></B></FONT>

<P>--<I>J. N. Rousseau<BR>Montreal, Quebec</I>

<P>Collier Smith of the <a href="http://www.bldrdoc.gov/">National Institute of
Standards and Technology</a> responds:

<P>"Looking at how the whip behaves gives a clue to this phenomenon (and it helps if
you have actually tried to crack a whip). The whip has to be moved so that a
U-shaped loop is formed near the handle, where the whip is thickest and stiffest.
As the whip is swung, the loop travels outward toward the thinner, lighter tip.
The loop travels progressively faster the closer it gets to the tip, because the
energy from the heavier part of the whip is carried along into the lighter,
thinner part. This amplification is analogous to way in which an ocean wave of
small height becomes a high breaker as it enters the shallow water near the shore
or over a reef.

<P>"When the loop reaches the end, it is going extremely fast and causes the very

"What is the function of the human appendix? Did it once have a purpose that has since been lost?"
</A></B></FONT>

<P>--<I>Ross Rowland<BR>Great Falls, Va.</I>

<P>Loren G. Martin, professor of physiology at Oklahoma State University, replies:

<P>"For years, the appendix was credited with very little physiological function. We
now know, however, that the appendix serves an important role in the fetus and in
young adults. Endocrine cells appear in the appendix of the human fetus at around
the 11th week of development. These endocrine cells of the fetal appendix have
been shown to produce various biogenic amines and peptide hormones, compounds
that assist with various biological control (homeostatic) mechanisms. There had
been little prior evidence of this or any other role of the appendix in animal
research, because the appendix does not exist in domestic mammals.

<P>"Among adult humans, the appendix is now thought to be involved primarily in
immune functions. Lymphoid tissue begins to accumulate in the appendix shortly
after birth and reaches a peak between the second and third decades of life,
decreasing rapidly thereafter and practically disappearing after the age of 60.
During the early years of development, however, the appendix has been shown to
function as a lymphoid organ, assisting with the maturation of B lymphocytes (one
variety of white blood cell) and in the production of the class of antibodies
known as immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies. Researchers have also shown that the
appendix is involved in the production of molecules that help to direct the
movement of lymphocytes to various other locations in the body.

<P>"In this context, the function of the appendix appears to be to expose white
blood cells to the wide variety of antigens, or foreign substances, present in
the gastrointestinal tract. Thus, the appendix probably helps to suppress
potentially destructive humoral (blood- and lymph-borne) antibody responses while
promoting local immunity. The appendix--like the tiny structures called Peyer's
patches in other areas of the gastrointestinal tract--takes up antigens from the
contents of the intestines and reacts to these contents. This local immune system
plays a vital role in the physiological immune response and in the control of
food, drug, microbial or viral antigens. The connection between these local
immune reactions and inflammatory bowel diseases, as well as autoimmune reactions
in which the individual's own tissues are attacked by the immune system, is
currently under investigation.

<P>"In the past, the appendix was often routinely removed and discarded during other
abdominal surgeries to prevent any possibility of a later attack of appendicitis;
the appendix is now spared in case it is needed later for reconstructive surgery
if the urinary bladder is removed. In such surgery, a section of the intestine is
formed into a replacement bladder, and the appendix is used to re-create a
'sphincter muscle' so that the patient remains continent (able to retain urine).
In addition, the appendix has been successfully fashioned into a makeshift
replacement for a diseased ureter, allowing urine to flow from the kidneys to the
bladder. As a result, the appendix, once regarded as a nonfunctional tissue, is
now regarded as an important 'back-up' that can be used in a variety of
reconstructive surgical techniques. It is no longer routinely removed and
discarded if it is healthy."

"How is caffeine is removed to produce decaffeinated
coffee?"
</A></B></FONT>

<P>--<I>Rick Woolley<BR> Everett, Wash.</I>

<P><a
href="http://www-unix.oit.umass.edu/~foodsci/Clydesdale.html"TARGET="_top">Fergus
Clydesdale</a>, head of the <a
href="http://www-unix.oit.umass.edu/~foodsci/"TARGET="_top">Food Science
Department</a> at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst,
provides this answer:

<P>"First, some background. Coffee is the second most popular
beverage in the world, after tea. Historians believed the use of
coffee as a stimulant originated in ancient Abyssinia
(Ethiopia). Caffeine is the component of coffee that is
responsible for its mild stimulatory effect on the central
nervous system. A six-ounce cup of coffee typically contains
approximately 50 to 75 milligrams of caffeine, although the
amount varies considerably depending on the method of
preparation and the type of coffee; Robusta coffee contains
nearly twice as much caffeine as Arabica, for instance. For
people who are sensitive to caffeine, even 10 milligrams can
cause discomfort. That is why nearly all decaffeinated coffees
contain less than 10 milligrams of caffeine (typically two to
five milligrams) per serving. Today decaffeinated coffee
accounts for approximately 12 percent of total worldwide coffee
consumption, or nearly 1 billion pounds per year.

<P>"The first process for decaffeinating coffee was invented by
Ludwig Roselius in 1905. Roselius's method used benzene, a
potentially toxic hydrocarbon, to remove caffeine from
premoistened, green coffee beans. Modern decaffeination
processes are much more gentle; many make that point by claiming
to be 'naturally decaffeinated.'

<P>"There are three main decaffeination processes currently in
use. They have some basic similarities. In all three approaches,
the green or roasted beans are first moistened, making the
caffeine soluble so that it can be drawn out. Also, they all
decaffeinate green coffee at moderate temperatures, typically
ranging from 70 to 100 degrees Celsius (160 to 210 degrees
Fahrenheit).

<P>"One method is water processing. As you might expect, this
process employs water as the solvent to remove caffeine from the
green coffee beans. Typically a battery extraction process using
eight to 12 vessels is employed; each vessel contains green
coffee at a different stage of decaffeination.

<P>"A mixture of water and green-coffee extract that has already
been reduced in caffeine is circulated around the coffee beans
within the extraction battery (oils in the coffee extract aid in
the decaffeination process). After a predetermined time, the
vessel that has been exposed to the low-caffeine extract is
isolated and emptied. The decaffeinated coffee beans are then
rinsed and dried, and a vessel containing fresh green coffee is
put on stream. The caffeine-rich extract that was drawn off from
the vessel containing the fresh, green coffee is passed through
a bed of activated charcoal, which absorbs the caffeine. This
charcoal has been pretreated with a carbohydrate, typically
sucrose, that helps it absorb caffeine without removing other
compounds that contribute to the flavor of the coffee. The
sucrose blocks carbon sites that would normally absorb sugars
from the liquid, green-coffee extract. The caffeine-reduced
extract can then be reused to begin the process anew. The water
process is natural (that is, it does not involve any chemicals),
but it is not very specific for caffeine; it removes 94 to 96
percent of the caffeine.

<P>"A second decaffeination method is the direct solvent method.
These days this technique usually employs methylene chloride
(used predominately in Europe), coffee oil or ethyl acetate to
dissolve the caffeine and extract it from the coffee. Ethyl
acetate is an ester that is found naturally in fruits and
vegetables such as bananas, apples and coffee. The liquid
solvent is circulated through a bed of moist, green coffee
beans, removing some of the caffeine; the solvent is then
recaptured in an evaporator, and the beans are washed with
water. Residues of the solvent are removed from the coffee to
trace levels by steaming the beans. Often this process utilizes
batch processing--that is, solvent is added to the vessel,
circulated and emptied several times until the coffee has been
decaffeinated to the desired level. Solvents are used because
they are generally more precisely targeted to caffeine than is
charcoal, leaving behind nearly all the noncaffeine solids. The
more caffeine-specific solvents, such as methylene chlorides,
can extract 96 to 97 percent of the caffeine.

<P>"The third approach, supercritical carbon dioxide
decaffeination, is very similar to the direct solvent methods,
except that in this case the solvent is carbon dioxide.
High-pressure vessels (operating at roughly 250 to 300 times
atmospheric pressure) are employed to circulate the carbon
dioxide through a bed of premoistened, green coffee beans. At
such pressures, carbon dioxide takes on unique, 'supercritical'
properties that enhance its usefulness as a solvent.
Supercritical carbon dioxide has a density like that of a
liquid, but its viscosity and diffusivity are similar to those
of a gas. These attributes significantly lower its pumping
costs. Carbon dioxide is a popular solvent because it has a
relatively low pressure critical point, and it is naturally
abundant. The caffeine-rich carbon dioxide exiting the
extraction vessel is either channeled through a bed of activated
charcoal or through a water 'bath' tower to absorb the caffeine.
The carbon dioxide is then recirculated back to the extraction
vessel. Supercritical carbon dioxide decaffeination is
capital-cost intensive, but it offers very good yields. It
typically can extract 96 to 98 percent of the caffeine
originally present in the beans."<P>

"Is it possible that a meteorite could strike a
commercial airliner and cause it to explode? Could this possibly
have caused the crash of TWA Flight 800?"
</A></B></FONT>

<P>--<I>Katherine Watson <BR>Address Withheld</I>

<P>We have already presented <a
href="http://www.sciam.com/askexpert/index2.html#acs86"TARGET="_top">two
responses</a> on this intriguing but controversial question. 
Here is another response from one of the leading experts on
impact phenomena, David Morrison of the <a
href="http://www.arc.nasa.gov/"TARGET="_top">NASA Ames Research Center</a>:

<P>"It is certainly possible for a meteorite to strike a
commercial airliner, although the probability is low. We can
make a very rough estimate by comparing the area of airliners
with the area of cars in the U.S. A typical car has an area on
the order of 10 square meters, and there are roughly 100 million
cars in the U.S., for a total cross-sectional area of about
1,000 square kilometers. The typical airliner has a
cross-sectional area of several hundred square meters, but the
number of planes is much smaller than the number of cars,
perhaps a few thousand. The total cross-sectional area of
airliners is therefore no more than 10 square kilometers, or a
factor of at least 100 less than that of cars. Three cars are
known to have been struck by meteorites in the U.S. during the
past century, so it would appear that the odds are against any
airplanes having been hit, but it is not impossible that one
might have been.

<P>"To my knowledge, there have been no reports of airplanes
being struck, however. If one were hit, it would be more likely
to occur on the ground than in the air, because airplanes spend
more time overall on the ground. And finally, even if one were
hit in flight by a meteorite, it would be unlikely to cause an
explosion of the sort that ended the flight of TWA Flight 800
last year."<P>

<H2 >SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN SPECIAL ISSUES</H2>

<B>September 1996: What You Need to Know About Cancer</B><P>
This may be the first special issue of Scientific American that, for
everyone on the staff, also qualifies as a personal issue. Several of us
have had brushes with cancer, or at least its specter.  The title, "What you
need to Know about  Cancer," makes a daring claim.  What exactly do you need
to know?  First, that many cancers are highly preventable.  Second, that the
ability of medicine to detect and treat cancer, though still far from ideal,
has progressed enough for patients to face their illness with greater
optimism.  Most of all we hope that readers will come away from this issue
with a greater sense that, armed with knowledge and courage, they can fight
back against this disease.<P>

Order extra or single copies of this important issue now.<P>

Product Code: 4E, Price - $9.95 U.S., $12.95 outside U.S.  <A HREF="specialord.html"> ORDER FORM</A> <P>








<B>October 1994: Life in The Universe</B><P>

In 1994, Scientific American entered its 150th year of
continuous publication. To celebrate this event, Scientific
American compiled a single- topic issue that pulls together
between its covers the great themes of discovery, understanding,
technological capability and optimism that have inspired the
editorial mission. <P>

In a series of articles by such eminent figures as Stephen
Weinberg, Carl Sagan, Marvin Minsky and Stephen J. Gould,
readers will watch the birth of the universe, witness the
emergence of life, and explore the future.  They will consider
the power that intelligence gives us to create a prosperous
society that is sustainable by the Earth's rich but fragile
environment.  <P>

<B>Key Technologies for the 21st Century</B><P>

Scientific American has unveiled, described and assessed the
relentless progress of our technological development for over
150 years.  With the publication of this single topic issue,
Scientific American now turns its sights to the year 2001 and
beyond. <P>

What technologies will shape our lives in the next century? What
new thresholds in achievement will we cross? What steps must we
take today to make the most of tomorrow's promise? The result is
Key Technologies for the 21st Century with insightful coverage
of "Intelligent Software," "Virtual Reality," "High-Tech
Trains," "Space Travel," and much more.  <P>

-- or anticipate venturing down that road -- be sure to use this
trailblazing guide from Scientific American.<P>

The Computer in the 21st Century features over 125 pages of

<B>Science in the 20th Century</B><P>

The millennial turn lies just a few years away.  Yet the century
has already established itself as a watershed in the history of
our species' effort to understand and master the forces of
nature.  For the first time, we have discerned the fundamental
character of matter, begun to comprehend the structure of the
universe and gained direct understanding of the chemical
processes that we call life. <P>

In this special issue, key researchers tell this story of
achievement in their own words, as they appeared in the pages of
Scientific American.  Although the record presents
accomplishment, it also offers glimpses of the experience of
doing science. Articles include: "What is Matter?" by Erwin
Schrodinger "On the Generalized Theory of Gravitation" by Albert
Einstein "The Structure of Hereditary Material" by F. H. C.
Crick "Continental Drift" by Tuzo Wilson<P>

<B>Ancient Cities</B><P>

The words city and civilization come from the same Latin roots.
Where did the first cities arise and what did they look like?
What secrets are locked in these centuries-old archeological
sites? What do they reveal about the history and destiny of
humankind? Exciting discoveries have shed fascinating light on
the earliest experiments in urban planning. The ways people
coalesced and developed complex systems and structures for
living in community is revealed in the dramatic history of
archaeological research.<P>

From Mesopotamia to the Mayans, the birth, life and  death of
cities is the subject of Scientific American's special
17-article issue, Ancient Cities. Articles include: "The Origin
of Cities" by Robert M. Adams "Pompeii" by Amedeo Maiuri "A
Roman Apartment Complex" by Donald J. Watts and Carol Martin
Watts "The Emergence of Maya Civilization" by Norman Hammond.<P>

<TR><TD><H2>Live Material Dimension Specifications</H2></TD></TR>

<TR><TD>Because of mechanical variations in printing and the varying thickness of a magazine from issue 
to issue, pages can trim to 7-3/4" wide x 10-3/4" deep (197 x 273 mm).  It is essential that "live 
matter" for full-page bleed units does not exceed 7-1/4" (184 mm) wide or 10-1/8" (257 mm) deep, 
centered on a film size of 8-1/4" x 11" (210 x 279 mm).  Standard trim size is 8-1/8" x 10-3/4" (206 x 
273 mm).  Saddle-wire stitched.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>For bleed spreads keep all live matter to a size of 15-1/8" x 10-1/8" (384 x 257 mm), centered on a 
film size of 16-1/2" x 11" (419 x 279 mm).  For center-spread material, film size is 16-3/8" x 11" (416 
x 279 mm).</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>Type matter on facing page spreads must be kept at least 1/8" (3 mm) away from the center fold on each page.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>The publisher reserves the right to crop material for variation in trim page size.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>When proofs are desired for corrections, materials must be supplied one week prior to regular materials due date.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD><H3>Material Requirements</H3></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN will accept four-color page and spread advertising submitted as digital 
data.  Arrangements should be made by contacting Richard Sasso at telephone (212) 754-0594, fax 
(212) 980-8175 or e-mail richsasso@sciam.com.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>Supply original film positives for web offset printing, right-reading, emulsion up.  Indicate issue date, page positioning and any other instructions on proofs and films.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>Film positives and proofs should be manufactured in accordance with SWOP (Specifications Web 
Offset Publications) specifications.*  Total density of colors and gray balance should be in 
accordance with established industry guidelines.  Halftone screen:  133 line.  Correctly produced 
film and proofs are essential to achieve a faithful production press result.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD><H3>Proofing</H3></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>-FOUR-COLOR:  Four offset proofs (plus three complete sets of progressive proofs, if available) on 
standard proofing stock using standard four-color process proofing inks and standard color bars 
are recommended.  Also acceptable are off-press proofs prepared to SWOP specifications.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>-BLACK & WHITE AND TWO-COLOR:  When proofing for black and white, or black plus a second 
color (matched or process), at least three press proofs or off-press proofs must accompany film.
</TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD>
-Supply a ruled-up proof with material to show desired position on page after trim.  Rule centerfold 
for spreads.

<H2>INFORMATION FOR CONTRIBUTORS</H2></CENTER>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN welcomes ideas for articles on recent
scientific discoveries, technical innovations and overviews of
ongoing research. Our preferred authors have extensive
first-hand knowledge of the field that they describe, and have
usually made significant contributions to it.<P>

If you would like to write for SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN, we ask
that you first send us a brief proposal for the article you
envision. (One or two printed pages is usually sufficient.) It
should describe the nature of the article's subject and its
impact on practical problems, whether in research, in industry
or in everyday life. Sketch out for us how you would best
organize the information to explain it to intelligent members
of the general public. Ideas for illustrations that would
accompany the article are also welcome at this stage, though
not essential. Please bear in mind that SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN
does not publish theories or accounts of research that have
not yet been discussed in the appropriate technical
literature.<P>

Your proposal will be acknowledged and considered by the Board
of Editors, and answered within about six weeks. If you would
like to send us additional materials that might be of
assistance in our deliberations, please let us know whether
you would like for them to be returned.<P>

Proposals may be addressed to the attention of the Board of Editors at:<P>

<B>SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN</B><BR>
415 Madison Avenue<BR>
New York, NY  10017<BR>
e-mail: <A HREF="mailto:editors@sciam.com">editors@sciam.com</A><BR>
fax: (212) 754-0813<P>

We look forward to hearing from you.<P>

Sincerely,<BR>

<title>Help on Making Queries</title>
</head><BODY>
<A NAME="Making Queries"></A><H1>Making Queries</H1>
Excite for Web Servers gives web users access to a sophisticated concept-based
searching engine. But even though the search engine is advanced, users
can form queries without using a complicated query language. This page
will help you to choose the queries that will give you the best
results.
<P>
<A NAME="Query Basics"></A><H2>Query Basics</H2>
A query is simply a description of an information need. Unlike Boolean
systems that search for just those documents containing <I>all</I> the
words in your query, Excite for Web Servers will search for documents that are a
best match for the words in your query. Excite for Web Servers will also search for
documents that are about the same concepts that your query describes,
so sometimes Excite for Web Servers will bring back articles that don't mention
<I>any</I> of the words in your original query.
<P>
What this means is that your query -- the description of your
information need -- can be as detailed as you like. Don't worry about
providing too many words; the more words, the better. Additional words
in your query will help Excite for Web Servers figure out what concepts you're
really interested in. On the other hand, Excite for Web Servers will do a pretty
good job of figuring out what documents are interesting to you even if
your query is vague.
<P>
For example, let's say you're searching a web site for documents about
customer support for the Widget2000 product you're using. A good
starting point would be
<P>
<PRE>
        customer support for the Widget2000
</PRE>

If you have a question about a particular feature of the Widget2000,
for example the Blurfl upgrade package, you might choose a query like
<P>
<PRE>
        customer support for the Blurfl upgrade package
        of the Widget2000
</PRE>

Even if there are no documents that are actually about the Blurfl
upgrade, Excite for Web Servers will still show you documents about Widget2000
customer support.
<P>
<A NAME="Advanced Query Tips"></A><H2>Advanced Query Tips</H2>
Here are some suggestions for getting the best results out of
Excite for Web Servers.
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>Only use words that are relevant to your query</B><DD>
If you're looking for documents about the Widget2000, don't enter a
query like "<CODE>Find me all documents about the Widget2000</CODE>". Excite for Web Servers
considers <I>all</I> the words in your query to be part of your
information need, so queries like the previous example will find all
documents about <I>finding all documents about</I> the Widget2000, which
may not be exactly what you want.
<P>
<DT><B>Specify multiple forms of the same phrases</B><DD>
Excite for Web Servers distinguishes between hyphenated and un-hyphenated words. So,
sometimes it might be necessary to explicitly say that you want both
versions, for example "<CODE>CDROM CD-ROM</CODE>". Excite for Web Servers will try to figure
out that <CODE>CDROM</CODE> and <CODE>CD-ROM</CODE> are the same, but it never hurts to
explicitly specify multiple forms.
<P>
<DT><B>Common words are ignored</B><DD>
Excite for Web Servers doesn't index common words like <I>a</I>, <I>and</I>, or <I>the</I>.
Consequently, those words in your query will be ignored. Excite for Web Servers also
ignores numbers; however, it can find strings that happen to contain a
number, for example <I>3Com</I>.

"Is it possible, as urban legend has it, for a tarantula to lay eggs inside a cactus?"
</A></B></FONT>

<P>--<I>Brendan O'Malley<BR>New York, NY</I>
Barbara H. Reger, president of the <a href="http://www.cowboy.net/~spider/ATS.html" TARGET="_top">American Tarantula Society</a>, responded in good humor:

<p>"I was amused by your inquiry, because this question is asked of me several times a year. 
No, it is quite improbable that this would ever occur. Tarantulas living in dry desert regions 
where cactus are found do often burrow at the base of the cactus, but not inside it. The sharp 
prickly spikes would harm them, and the conditions there are inappropriate for laying eggs. 

<p>"The following paragraphs are quoted from an article, 'Detonating Cactus Yields Tarantula 
Shrapnel,' I wrote in the FORUM of the American Tarantula Society, Vol. 2 No 2, 1993:

<p>"Have you heard the one about the lady whose neighbor bought a cactus at her local garden 
center? When she got it home and watered it, the thing swelled up and exploded, raining baby 
Tarantulas down all over the place. She called an exterminator, but he offered very little hope. 
The poor woman actually had to sell her home and move. 

<p>"Or, did you hear the one about the woman whose brother's best friend brought a cactus back 
from Arizona? He had it for a year. Every time he watered it the thing grew larger and larger. One 
day it suddenly exploded, and baby tarantulas went everywhere. They called an exterminator who 
told them that he received numerous calls weekly because this same thing has been happening all 
over the city. 

<p>"For the past three years, I have been running into people that have given me variations of this 
same story. They look me up because they know I study tarantulas. What's really amazing is how 
angry or offended they get when I explain to them that the story is not true. They feel like I am 
calling them a liar. I tell them to please get the name for me of the person that claimed this 
happened. They can never come up with a name. They always say that it wasn't their neighbor's 
friend, is was a friend of a friend, etc. I even try to explain to them that spiderlings could not be 
living in a cactus and still develop properly as the cactus was watered time and again. I even 
explain the way a tarantula constructs its burrow in the desert. They won't listen because they 
are too enamored with the idea of being offended.

<p>"The first time I encountered this story it involved the parent of one of my students. She said 
her neighbor had purchased the cactus at Frank's Nursery and Crafts. I called this local store, and 
they said they had already received numerous calls on it. They told me it wasn't their store, but the 
one on the north side of the city. I called this store and was sent on a wild goose chase all over 
Indianapolis and then throughout the state. Actually, Frank's buys their cacti from a nursery in 
Canada. We all know how many tarantulas live there! This rumor got so bad in Indianapolis that the <I>Indianapolis Star </I> printed an article about it and how rumors and tall tales tend to use 
pseudo-witnesses to add validation to their stories. 

<p>"I'm sure you all have variations of this story too. At least now, armed with my copy of the 
article from our local paper, I can prove to people that it is indeed a rumor. Well, actually, I 
should say I can show people that others have heard the same story. Scientific evidence of any 
sort doesn't seem to satisfy them, they still are offended by being demonstrated silly and will 
not have it any other way."

<p>Fred Sherberger of <a href="http://www.fernbank.edu/fsc2.html" TARGET="_top">Fernbank Science Center</a> in Atlanta, who is the associate editor for the American Tarantula Society, 
offered some further comments:

<p>"This one of those things that you hear all the time that simply is not true, like the 'fact' that grasshoppers make sounds by rubbing their legs together. But it isn't true--grasshoppers don't do 
that. Katydid males rub their wings together. In other cases, the insects may rub a wing and a leg together (which makes a musical sound) or they may snap open the back wings (which creates 
more of a snap-crackle-pop noise).

<p>"There's a basic logical flaw in the tarantula story. Once tarantulas lay their eggs, the baby 
tarantulas do not get any nutrient other than what is present in the egg; when the tarantula hatches, 
it cannot be any larger than the eggs it hatched from (just like a chick emerging from a hen's egg). 
So what would make the cactus explode? And I always hear of a cactus exploding--you never hear 
of an oak tree being torn asunder by hatching tarantulas.

<p>"It's hard to say why this story is so persistent. Perhaps people see the egg sack of a house 
spider and then later see big clump of spiders in the same place. You might wonder, gee, how did 
all those spiders come from that little sack? But in fact you are not looking just at the mass of the bodies; you are seeing them all spread out after they have hatched. I find it hard to believe that 
logical people believe the story is true. Mostly, people probably repeat the story because it is 
cute and funny. That's how I look at it--I laugh and say, oh no, not again!"

"What would be the effect on life if a supernova exploded close to the earth? 
If it were at the distance of the closest star, would a supernova be able to sterilize the planet?"
</A></B></FONT>

<P>--<I>P.K. Birkmeyer<BR>Hampton, Va.</I>

<p><a href="http://astro.princeton.edu/~richmond/" TARGET="_top">Michael Richmond</a> in the department of astrophysical sciences at Princeton University responds:

<p>"The primary danger to life on the earth from a <a href="http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/pubinfo/leaflets/supernovae/supernovae.html" TARGET="_top">supernova</a> would be the high-energy radiation (x-rays and gamma rays) produced by the radioactive decay of elements synthesized in the explosion. There are two types of supernovae: massive stars that run out of fuel in their cores and collapse (called 'Type II' or 'Type Ib' supernovae), and white dwarf stars that accrete enough material from a close companion to undergo runaway thermonuclear fusion (called 'Type Ia' supernovae). Both kinds of supernovae create radioactive nickel 56, which decays into cobalt 56, emitting gamma rays as it changes; the cobalt 56 then decays into iron 56, releasing additional gamma rays. As the gamma rays fly through the debris ejected during the explosion, they collide with nuclei and electrons and transfer some of their energy to these particles. Nevertheless, a very large amount of high-energy radiation makes its ways through the ejecta and escapes into space.

<p>"Our sun emits high-energy radiation, too, most notably during a solar flare. A supernova puts even the largest solar flare to shame, however, producing more dangerous radiation in a single second than a year's worth of continuous solar flares. If a supernova were as close as Alpha Centauri, the nearest star system (4.3 light-years away), it would dump as many x-rays into the earth's atmosphere as 1,000 simultaneous solar flares, and it would continue doing so for several months. It is possible that the earth's atmosphere would not be able to absorb all this radiation and that some fraction might reach the ground, bombarding unprotected creatures with lethal doses of x-rays.

<p>"Fortunately, the stars that might become supernovae are extremely rare; there are no such stars within at least 10 parsecs (one parsec is 3.26 light-years) of the earth, and there are probably none within 100 parsecs. Because the intensity of radiation decreases in proportion to the square of the distance, we are in no danger from more distant explosions."

<p><a href="http://www.kingsu.ab.ca/~brian/brian.htm" TARGET="_top">Brian E. Martin</a>, an associate professor of mathematics, physics and astronomy at the King's University College in Alberta, Canada, offers another perspective:

<p>"It never fails: whenever I give a public talk or lecture to freshmen and the topic leads to supernovae, a hand shoots up and someone asks, "What would happen if our nearest stellar neighbor went supernova?" This is an excellent question and can be used to uncover a lot of basic physics. So let's consider the following scenario: We are situated one parsec away from a Type Ia supernova. Are we toast? Sad to say, yes! 

<p>"First, let's look at the optical effects. Supernovae come in two basic flavors: Type I are the result of the detonation of a mass-accreting white dwarf in a binary system; Type II supernovae are the end games of massive, single stars. Type I are the more energetic of the two and can, briefly, outshine their parent galaxy. Astronomers use absolute magnitude (M) as a measure of the intrinsic brightness of an object; absolute magnitude is defined as the brightness that the object would have at a distance of 10 parsecs. Type I supernovae have absolute magnitudes on the order of 19 (at the same distance, the sun would have a magnitude of 4.8; the difference of 24 magnitudes means that a Type I supernova is about three billion times brighter!). If such a supernova occurred only one parsec away, we can use the 'distance modulus formula' (m  M = 5 log[r/10]) to estimate the apparent visual magnitude (m) of the object. The supernova would not quite rival the sun (magnitude 24 for the supernova versus 26.7 for the sun) but would be clearly visible during the day as an intense point of blue-white light about one tenth as bright as the sun. Such a supernova would produce a marvelous sight--two suns in the sky--and would have significant effects on the climate. But as we shall next see, it is unlikely anyone would be around to marvel at the spectacle!

<p>"Gamma-ray-burst effects will be the big problem. The optical emission from the supernova comes from the rapidly expanding photosphere (equivalent to the visible surface of the sun) of the exploding star as it hurtles at thousands of kilometers per second into interstellar space. It will brighten for several weeks and then begin a more gradual denouement. Meanwhile, however, one of the most violent energy bursts known will have already taken place. As the star explodes, a shock wave wells up from the core and crashes through the photosphere with ferocious violence, triggering a burst of gamma radiation. Estimates put the energy emitted by this shock on the order of 5 x 10<sup>47 </sup>ergs (which is about equal to the sun's entire output at all wavelengths for three million years!). The entire event will take a mere 10 microseconds or so. As the radiation floods into interstellar space, the earth will suffer a fatal blow. At a distance of one parsec, our upper atmosphere would be subjected to a gamma-ray intensity of about four billion ergs per square centimeter. The result would be intense ionization of the molecular nitrogen and oxygen in the air and the production of ozone-depleting nitrous oxide (NO) compounds. This chemical stew would almost certainly destroy the ozone layer (some researchers estimate that the 'lethal limit' for ozone-layer destruction is on the order of several million ergs per square centimeter). 

<p>"With our protective ozone layer gone, we would be in grave danger. First, harmful ultraviolet rays from the sun would begin to irradiate the planet. More significant, however, would be the steadily growing background of x-ray and gamma radiation from the supernova. As the supernova expands outward, radioactive heavy elements produced in the explosion would begin to decay, sending high-energy radiation into the surrounding space. Most significant is the nickel-cobalt-iron chain of radioactive decay, which would produce a steady supply of lethal radiation for at least the next year. The <a href="http://ledas-www.star.le.ac.uk/ginga/ginga.html" TARGET="_top">Ginga</a> x-ray satellite noted a flux of hard and soft x-rays from supernova 1987A; the observed intensity was about 4 x 10<sup>-11 </sup>ergs per square centimeter per second for a period of over a year. Supernova 1987A exploded in the Large Magellanic Cloud, about 50,000 parsecs away. At a distance of one parsec, the x-ray flux would climb to about 0.2 erg per square centimeter per second, which is on the order of magnitude of the x-ray emission from a large solar flare. But unlike a solar flare, which may last for a few seconds to a few minutes, the supernova emissions will persist for months to years--after the earth has lost the protective benefit of the ozone layer. If this happens, we are indeed toast!

<p>"I hope I have convinced you that a supernova explosion at one parsec is not a good idea. In fact , it is likely to be worse than I indicated, because I did not even mention the possible harmful effects that could be produced by the normally unnoticed neutrinos that are emitted in copious profusion during a supernova or by the x-rays from the newly forming supernova remnant. Even at a distance of 1,000 parsecs, a supernova could probably produce serious effects on the earth. In the 1970s astrophysicist Malvin Ruderman suggested (see the article by M. A. Ruderman in <I>Science</I>, Vol. 184, page 1079;1974) that the mean time between close encounters with supernovae--those at a distance less than 1,000 parsecs--is on the order of 60 million years. Interestingly, the dinosaurs went extinct 65 million years ago. Is this number a coincidence?  

<p>Juan I. Collar of CERN (the European Organization for Nuclear Research) near Geneva, Switzerland, offers yet another view, focusing on some recent research:

<p>"Prompted by the identification that the Geminga gamma-radiation source (located approximately 200 light-years away from the solar system) is a supernova remnant, astronomers John Ellis and <a href="http://rainbow.uchicago.edu/physics/t_astro.html#Schramm" TARGET="_top">David N. Schramm</a> revisited the possible effects on life of a nearby supernova explosion [see "Could a Nearby Supernova Explosion Have Caused a Mass Extinction?" J. Ellis and D. N. Schramm in <I>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA</I>, Vol. 92, No. 1, pages 235-238; January 3, 1995]. For a supernova roughly 10 parsecs away, the researchers estimated that the increase in the cosmic-ray-induced radiation dose would not by itself be catastrophic for most organisms. They did find, however, that the ionizing radiation would produce nitrous oxide (NO) in the atmosphere at a rate that guarantees the destruction of the ozone layer for 300 years or so, shutting down photosynthesis in marine plants and wreaking havoc on the global ecology. Fortunately, Ellis and Schramm estimated that this cataclysmic episode should take place only once every 100 million years or so. In principle, it should be possible to find evidence of such a nearby supernova explosion by looking for isotope anomalies in the geologic record [see "<a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/9605128">Geological Isotope Anomalies as Signatures of Nearby Supernovae</a>." John Ellis, Brian D. Fields and David N. Schramm in <I>Astrophysical Journal</I>, Vol. 470, No. 2, pages 1227-1236; October 20, 1996].

<p>"Not every stellar collapse necessarily leads to a supernova. Some theorists have suggested that stellar collapses can also take place in a more 'silent' manner, in which case the resulting energy emission would be almost only in the form of neutrinos. These silent collapses would be less conspicuous than supernova explosions and could easily have been overlooked; it is possible that they occur more frequently in our galaxy than the usual 'loud' collapses. The prevalence of silent collapses will be elucidated in the coming years by current and upcoming neutrino experiments [see the page on <a href="http://snodaq.phy.queensu.ca/SNO/experiments.html" TARGET="_top">Neutrino Experiments</a> from Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario]. The large flux of neutrinos from a nearby silent stellar collapse might still be hazardous to life: the energetic neutrinos could cause so many mutations (by inducing nuclear recoils in genetic material) to cause grave damage to living things [see "<a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/9505028" TARGET="_top">Biological Effects of Stellar Collapse Neutrinos</a>." J. I. Collar in <I>Physical Review Letters</I>, Vol. 76, No. 6, pages 999-1002; February 5, 1996].

<p>"The closest stars to the solar system are the three members of the Alpha Centauri system. They sit only 4.3 light-years (1.3 parsecs) from the earth, and if one of them were to explode as a supernova or undergo a silent collapse, the effects on the biosphere would be catastrophic. Luckily, none of them has nearly enough mass for this to happen!"

"What is known about the nature and diagnosis of Tourette's syndrome? Do we know what causes it, and can it ever be cured?"
</A></B></FONT>


<P>--<I>Debbie Eckardt<BR>Eugene, Ore.</I>

<P>We ran a <a href="http://www.sciam.com/askexpert/011397medicine.html#acs72">brief
response to this question</a> several weeks ago. Now <a
href="http://cbdb1.nimh.nih.gov/staff/weinberg/dan.htm"TARGET="_top">Daniel R. Weinberger</a>,
chief of the <a href="http://cbdb1.nimh.nih.gov/">clinical brain disorders
branch</a> at the National Institute of Mental Health, has written with
additional information and references:

<P>"Tourette's syndrome is a curious medical condition defined by a constellation of
involuntary behavioral manifestations involving abnormal movements and
utterances. The abnormal involuntary movements, called motor tics, are
repetitive, stereotyped movements, usually of the face and neck. In most cases,
they are simple and brief, such as eye blinking, neck jerking, lip smacking or
protruding of the tongue. Occasionally the movements are more complex and involve
motor routines, such as bending over and touching one's toes or sniffing one's
fingers. The utterances, called vocal tics, are also usually brief, stereotyped
and repetitive--for instance, throat clearing, snorting, sniffing or grunting. In
rare instances, the vocal tics can be complex and involve involuntary repetition
of whole phrases, such as parts of the speech of others (echolalia), and swearing
(coprolalia).

<P>"Although the tics of Tourette's syndrome are involuntary, they are under a
certain degree of conscious control and can be suppressed for varying degrees of
time. Interestingly, most affected individuals notice that the longer they
suppress their tics, the more they feel an urge to release them. This compulsive
quality to the manifestations led Gilles de la Tourette, the 19th-century French
neurologist who described the condition, to refer to it as 'tic compulsif.'

<P>"In virutally all cases, Tourette's syndrome begins in childhood, usually before
the age of 10. It is a fairly common disorder, occurring in approximately five
out of every 10,000 people. This prevalence rate probably underestimates the
frequency of milder forms of the disorder, which involve only motor or only vocal
tics. Common tic phenomena, such as nervous throat clearing or smacking of the
lips, probably represent in many instances milder forms of Tourette's syndrome.
In general, the degree and manner of tics tend to vary over time, often being
worse during stress or illness. The condition is usually lifelong, but many
individuals experience some reduction in the severity of their symptoms as they
grow into adulthood. Tourette's syndrome is almost never physically disabling.
Most individuals learn to compensate for their symptoms or to accept them as part
of their lives and require no or only occasional treatment. The psychological and
social aspects of the malady, which can be considerable, represent its main
burden.

<P>"The cause of Tourette's syndrome is unknown. Throughout much of this century, it
was regarded as a purely psychological condition, but it is now known to be
neurological in origin. Family studies and studies of twins have confirmed that
there is a genetic basis for the disorder, although the gene or genes have yet to
be identified. There is no diagnostic laboratory test for Tourette's syndrome,
nor are there unique features that show up in neural imaging techniques, although
there are subtle abnormalities in certain brain structures (for example, the
caudate nucleus) and neurochemical systems (dopamine, for instance) that have
been associated with the disorder. How these findings contribute to the clinical
manifestations of the condition is a matter of much speculation.

<P>"It has become increasingly clear that Tourette's syndrome is more than just
movements and noises. Many patients also experience the intrusion of involuntary
compulsive thoughts and feel the urge to perform repetitive, often illogical
acts, such as repetitive counting, checking and hand washing. These
obsessive-compulsive symptoms also run in the families of patients with
Tourette's syndrome and have led to the belief that the gene or genes underlying
the disorder are related to the gene or genes for obsessive-compulsive disorder.
The brain regions that have been implicated in Tourette's syndrome also overlap
with those that have been linked to obsessive-compulsive disorder. Hence, the two
syndromes appear to represent varying manifestations of a common neurobiological
spectrum.

<P>"The treatment of Tourette's syndrome is based on the degree of symptoms and
distress that individuals experience. Drugs that diminish dopamine activity in
the brain (such as haloperidol, pimozide and risperidone) are effective for
treating the tics. Serotonin reuptake inhibitors, which are used to treat
depression, are also effective in ameliorating the obsessive-compulsive
manifestations. Unfortunately, these drugs are not entirely free of side effects,
and some individuals find the side effects less tolerable than the tics.
Psychological counseling and support groups are often helpful in learning to cope
with the social and psychological ramifications of the disorder.

<P>"For most patients with Tourette's syndrome and related tic disorders, the course
of treatment is benign and the outcome is good. Future prospects for
understanding the basic causes of the disorder and for developing more effective
treatments are promising. One of the most important reasons for this optimism is
the public education effort and research support of the <a
href="http://neuro-www2.mgh.harvard.edu/TSA/tsamain.nclk">Tourette's Syndrome
Association</a> in Bayside, N.Y. The work of this lay organization has had an
enormous impact in reducing the stigma associated with Tourette's syndrome and in
making research about this disorder a priority of the biomedical research
community."

"How can the extremity of a whip travel faster than the speed of sound to produce the characteristic "crack"?"
</A></B></FONT>

<P>--<I>J. N. Rousseau<BR>Montreal, Quebec</I>

<P>Collier Smith of the <a href="http://www.bldrdoc.gov/">National Institute of
Standards and Technology</a> responds:

<P>"Looking at how the whip behaves gives a clue to this phenomenon (and it helps if
you have actually tried to crack a whip). The whip has to be moved so that a
U-shaped loop is formed near the handle, where the whip is thickest and stiffest.
As the whip is swung, the loop travels outward toward the thinner, lighter tip.
The loop travels progressively faster the closer it gets to the tip, because the
energy from the heavier part of the whip is carried along into the lighter,
thinner part. This amplification is analogous to way in which an ocean wave of
small height becomes a high breaker as it enters the shallow water near the shore
or over a reef.

<P>"When the loop reaches the end, it is going extremely fast and causes the very
tip to 'whip' around in a tight circle. It is at this point that the tip exceeds
the speed necessary to create a tiny shock wave in the air; it is this shock that
we hear as the 'crack.' "

"What is the function of the human appendix? Did it once have a purpose that has since been lost?"
</A></B></FONT>

<P>--<I>Ross Rowland<BR>Great Falls, Va.</I>

<P>Loren G. Martin, professor of physiology at Oklahoma State University, replies:

<P>"For years, the appendix was credited with very little physiological function. We
now know, however, that the appendix serves an important role in the fetus and in
young adults. Endocrine cells appear in the appendix of the human fetus at around
the 11th week of development. These endocrine cells of the fetal appendix have
been shown to produce various biogenic amines and peptide hormones, compounds
that assist with various biological control (homeostatic) mechanisms. There had
been little prior evidence of this or any other role of the appendix in animal
research, because the appendix does not exist in domestic mammals.

<P>"Among adult humans, the appendix is now thought to be involved primarily in
immune functions. Lymphoid tissue begins to accumulate in the appendix shortly
after birth and reaches a peak between the second and third decades of life,
decreasing rapidly thereafter and practically disappearing after the age of 60.
During the early years of development, however, the appendix has been shown to
function as a lymphoid organ, assisting with the maturation of B lymphocytes (one
variety of white blood cell) and in the production of the class of antibodies
known as immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies. Researchers have also shown that the
appendix is involved in the production of molecules that help to direct the
movement of lymphocytes to various other locations in the body.

<P>"In this context, the function of the appendix appears to be to expose white
blood cells to the wide variety of antigens, or foreign substances, present in
the gastrointestinal tract. Thus, the appendix probably helps to suppress
potentially destructive humoral (blood- and lymph-borne) antibody responses while
promoting local immunity. The appendix--like the tiny structures called Peyer's
patches in other areas of the gastrointestinal tract--takes up antigens from the
contents of the intestines and reacts to these contents. This local immune system
plays a vital role in the physiological immune response and in the control of
food, drug, microbial or viral antigens. The connection between these local
immune reactions and inflammatory bowel diseases, as well as autoimmune reactions
in which the individual's own tissues are attacked by the immune system, is
currently under investigation.

<P>"In the past, the appendix was often routinely removed and discarded during other
abdominal surgeries to prevent any possibility of a later attack of appendicitis;
the appendix is now spared in case it is needed later for reconstructive surgery
if the urinary bladder is removed. In such surgery, a section of the intestine is
formed into a replacement bladder, and the appendix is used to re-create a
'sphincter muscle' so that the patient remains continent (able to retain urine).
In addition, the appendix has been successfully fashioned into a makeshift
replacement for a diseased ureter, allowing urine to flow from the kidneys to the
bladder. As a result, the appendix, once regarded as a nonfunctional tissue, is
now regarded as an important 'back-up' that can be used in a variety of
reconstructive surgical techniques. It is no longer routinely removed and
discarded if it is healthy."

"How is caffeine is removed to produce decaffeinated
coffee?"
</A></B></FONT>

<P>--<I>Rick Woolley<BR> Everett, Wash.</I>

<P><a
href="http://www-unix.oit.umass.edu/~foodsci/Clydesdale.html"TARGET="_top">Fergus
Clydesdale</a>, head of the <a
href="http://www-unix.oit.umass.edu/~foodsci/"TARGET="_top">Food Science
Department</a> at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst,
provides this answer:

<P>"First, some background. Coffee is the second most popular
beverage in the world, after tea. Historians believed the use of
coffee as a stimulant originated in ancient Abyssinia
(Ethiopia). Caffeine is the component of coffee that is
responsible for its mild stimulatory effect on the central
nervous system. A six-ounce cup of coffee typically contains
approximately 50 to 75 milligrams of caffeine, although the
amount varies considerably depending on the method of
preparation and the type of coffee; Robusta coffee contains
nearly twice as much caffeine as Arabica, for instance. For
people who are sensitive to caffeine, even 10 milligrams can
cause discomfort. That is why nearly all decaffeinated coffees
contain less than 10 milligrams of caffeine (typically two to
five milligrams) per serving. Today decaffeinated coffee
accounts for approximately 12 percent of total worldwide coffee
consumption, or nearly 1 billion pounds per year.

<P>"The first process for decaffeinating coffee was invented by
Ludwig Roselius in 1905. Roselius's method used benzene, a
potentially toxic hydrocarbon, to remove caffeine from
premoistened, green coffee beans. Modern decaffeination
processes are much more gentle; many make that point by claiming
to be 'naturally decaffeinated.'

<P>"There are three main decaffeination processes currently in
use. They have some basic similarities. In all three approaches,
the green or roasted beans are first moistened, making the
caffeine soluble so that it can be drawn out. Also, they all
decaffeinate green coffee at moderate temperatures, typically
ranging from 70 to 100 degrees Celsius (160 to 210 degrees
Fahrenheit).

<P>"One method is water processing. As you might expect, this
process employs water as the solvent to remove caffeine from the
green coffee beans. Typically a battery extraction process using
eight to 12 vessels is employed; each vessel contains green
coffee at a different stage of decaffeination.

<P>"A mixture of water and green-coffee extract that has already
been reduced in caffeine is circulated around the coffee beans
within the extraction battery (oils in the coffee extract aid in
the decaffeination process). After a predetermined time, the
vessel that has been exposed to the low-caffeine extract is
isolated and emptied. The decaffeinated coffee beans are then
rinsed and dried, and a vessel containing fresh green coffee is
put on stream. The caffeine-rich extract that was drawn off from
the vessel containing the fresh, green coffee is passed through
a bed of activated charcoal, which absorbs the caffeine. This
charcoal has been pretreated with a carbohydrate, typically
sucrose, that helps it absorb caffeine without removing other
compounds that contribute to the flavor of the coffee. The
sucrose blocks carbon sites that would normally absorb sugars
from the liquid, green-coffee extract. The caffeine-reduced
extract can then be reused to begin the process anew. The water
process is natural (that is, it does not involve any chemicals),
but it is not very specific for caffeine; it removes 94 to 96
percent of the caffeine.

<P>"A second decaffeination method is the direct solvent method.
These days this technique usually employs methylene chloride
(used predominately in Europe), coffee oil or ethyl acetate to
dissolve the caffeine and extract it from the coffee. Ethyl
acetate is an ester that is found naturally in fruits and
vegetables such as bananas, apples and coffee. The liquid
solvent is circulated through a bed of moist, green coffee
beans, removing some of the caffeine; the solvent is then
recaptured in an evaporator, and the beans are washed with
water. Residues of the solvent are removed from the coffee to
trace levels by steaming the beans. Often this process utilizes
batch processing--that is, solvent is added to the vessel,
circulated and emptied several times until the coffee has been
decaffeinated to the desired level. Solvents are used because
they are generally more precisely targeted to caffeine than is
charcoal, leaving behind nearly all the noncaffeine solids. The
more caffeine-specific solvents, such as methylene chlorides,
can extract 96 to 97 percent of the caffeine.

<P>"The third approach, supercritical carbon dioxide
decaffeination, is very similar to the direct solvent methods,
except that in this case the solvent is carbon dioxide.
High-pressure vessels (operating at roughly 250 to 300 times
atmospheric pressure) are employed to circulate the carbon
dioxide through a bed of premoistened, green coffee beans. At
such pressures, carbon dioxide takes on unique, 'supercritical'
properties that enhance its usefulness as a solvent.
Supercritical carbon dioxide has a density like that of a
liquid, but its viscosity and diffusivity are similar to those
of a gas. These attributes significantly lower its pumping
costs. Carbon dioxide is a popular solvent because it has a
relatively low pressure critical point, and it is naturally
abundant. The caffeine-rich carbon dioxide exiting the
extraction vessel is either channeled through a bed of activated
charcoal or through a water 'bath' tower to absorb the caffeine.
The carbon dioxide is then recirculated back to the extraction
vessel. Supercritical carbon dioxide decaffeination is
capital-cost intensive, but it offers very good yields. It
typically can extract 96 to 98 percent of the caffeine
originally present in the beans."<P>

"Is it possible that a meteorite could strike a
commercial airliner and cause it to explode? Could this possibly
have caused the crash of TWA Flight 800?"
</A></B></FONT>

<P>--<I>Katherine Watson <BR>Address Withheld</I>

<P>We have already presented <a
href="http://www.sciam.com/askexpert/index2.html#acs86"TARGET="_top">two
responses</a> on this intriguing but controversial question. 
Here is another response from one of the leading experts on
impact phenomena, David Morrison of the <a
href="http://www.arc.nasa.gov/"TARGET="_top">NASA Ames Research Center</a>:

<P>"It is certainly possible for a meteorite to strike a
commercial airliner, although the probability is low. We can
make a very rough estimate by comparing the area of airliners
with the area of cars in the U.S. A typical car has an area on
the order of 10 square meters, and there are roughly 100 million
cars in the U.S., for a total cross-sectional area of about
1,000 square kilometers. The typical airliner has a
cross-sectional area of several hundred square meters, but the
number of planes is much smaller than the number of cars,
perhaps a few thousand. The total cross-sectional area of
airliners is therefore no more than 10 square kilometers, or a
factor of at least 100 less than that of cars. Three cars are
known to have been struck by meteorites in the U.S. during the
past century, so it would appear that the odds are against any
airplanes having been hit, but it is not impossible that one
might have been.

<P>"To my knowledge, there have been no reports of airplanes
being struck, however. If one were hit, it would be more likely
to occur on the ground than in the air, because airplanes spend
more time overall on the ground. And finally, even if one were
hit in flight by a meteorite, it would be unlikely to cause an
explosion of the sort that ended the flight of TWA Flight 800
last year."<P>

<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=350><P>

The computing power inside your skull vastly exceeds that of any
supercomputer in the world. But for the past half century,
neuroscientists have generally supposed that the process by
which the brain achieves its phenomenal performance is
fundamentally similar to the way electronic computers work.
According to the conventional view, thinking takes place through
the aggregate action of billions of simple elements--cells
called neurons--that are wired up in an extremely complicated
way. Supercomputers are likewise built of millions of
interlinked simple switches, consisting of transistors on
silicon chips by companies such as <a
href="http://www.intel.com/">Intel</a>.

<P>Recent research is forcing a re-evaluation of this standard
model. Individual neurons, it turns out, are not so simple after
all: experiments have shown that they can actually perform
surprisingly complex calculations and register fine
discriminations. It is even possible that networks of
interacting molecules within an individual neuron might perform
specific computations, <a
href="http://www.klab.caltech.edu/~koch/">Christof Koch</a> of
the California Institute of Technology reported in the January
16, 1997 issue of <a
href="http://www.nature.com/"><I>Nature</I></a>. The organ of
thought is looking far more complex than scientists believed
just a few years ago.


<P>Koch's conclusions are based on studies of the precise
electrical behavior of cells in the brain. Neurons conduct
signals in the form of tiny electrical impulses, known as <a
href="http://www.bell-labs.com/new/gallery/neuron.html">spikes</a>.
Messages travel from one neuron to another as pulses of
chemicals that are released at specialized junctions, or
synapses; there are trillions of such junctions in the human
brain. How and when synapses relay messages between neurons is
crucially important in controlling mental activity. Moreover,
neuroscientists believe that learning occurs through a change in
the strength of certain synaptic connections. A frequently-used
synapse becomes stronger, whereas an infrequently used one may
grow weaker over time.

<P>Researchers have long understood the basic division of
function in the neuron. One set of branch-like extensions from
the cell bears incoming synapses; another set of branches,
usually located at the end of a long threadlike extension,
processes outgoing messages. In the traditional view of the
neuron, which goes back to experiments conducted in the 1940s,
the cell functions as a fairly simple on-off switch. A spike
would be initiated in a neuron if the total amount of
stimulation at all the incoming excitatory synapses exceeded
some critical level. (Conversely, if the neuron received enough
inhibitory synaptic signals, it would stop producing spikes.)

<P>Yet as Koch observes, scientists have discovered that neurons
actually have numerous electrically-active components in the
incoming branches. These active components, which include the <a
href="http://www.gene.com:80/ae/WN/SU/mem496.html">NMDA
receptor</a>, a protein that spans the neuronal membrane, modify
the effect of incoming messages. For example, the active
components ensure that spikes received at synapses that are
adjacent to one another carry more weight than spikes received
at widely-separated synapses. Computer simulations show that
active elements probably <I>multiply</I> the influence of
adjacent synapses, rather than merely adding them together as
the traditional neurologists had supposed. This finding adds a
layer of complication to the picture of how the brain works.

<P>And the story gets still more involved. Koch notes that the
conventional idea that the timing of individual spikes is
unimportant turns out to be quite wrong. Researchers had
generally supposed that the representation of information in the
brain depends essentially on the overall rate of firing of the
neurons. But <a
href="http://www.sloan.salk.edu/~zador/monkey_info.html">experiments
over the past few years</a> have shown conclusively that some
cells in monkeys' brains  can adjust the intervals between
spikes in increments as little as one hundredth of as second.
Moreover, the temporal patterns of spike activity across
different neurons is sometimes controlled with an even finer
accuracy of about one thousandth of a second. Contrary to the
common wisdom, "the  brain appears to care a great deal about
timing," Koch says.

<P>These results raise a new question: what is the purpose of
all of that very precise neural timing? Koch points toward
breaking research that may offer a clue. Spikes, once initiated
in a neuron, do not propagate only in the "forward"
direction--that is, toward the synapses that relay outgoing
messages. Rather, experiments on isolated brain tissue indicate
that spikes also move backwards, up the neuron's input branches.

<P>The effect that these back-propagated spikes have on the
active components of the brain--if indeed the phenomenon occurs
in intact animals-- is far from clear. But a study published in
the January 10, 1997 issue of <a
href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/vol275/issue5297/"><I>Science</I></a>
by Henry Markram of the <a
href="http://wissgi.weizmann.ac.il/">Weizmann Institute for
Science</a> and his collaborators suggests that back-propagated
spikes can dramatically influence the way a neuron processes an
impulse. The precise order in which one spike arrives at a
synapse and another one back-propagates to the receiving neuron
greatly influences the subsequent strength of a synapse,
Markram's group showed. If the back-propagated spike arrives
first, the synapse is weakened; conversely, if the
back-propagated spike arrives second, the synapse is
intensified.

<P>This unexpected phenomenon might specifically boost the
synapses that are conveying messages while suppressing random or
unimportant signals. Other research conducted in the past year
has shown that synapses can quickly adapt to the incoming rate
of spikes at different synapses. In this way, the synapses can
remain highly responsive to any sudden changes in electrical
activity over a large range of background levels.

<P>Taken together, Koch believes, these new insights into the
capabilities of the single neuron suggest the brain should
really be viewed as a hybrid computer, one that employs both
digital pulses (between neurons) and analog computations (within
them). The brain, then, is quite unlike a digital computer in
its basic underpinnings. Even if the brain is built of hybrid
digital-analog neurons, it need not have any computational
powers that are utterly beyond those of a simple digital
computer. But <a
href="http://www.klab.caltech.edu/publications/Koch_Mathur96.html">simulating
such a brain</a> using hybrid digital-analog elements may take
thousands of times longer than it would take to simulate a brain
built of the same number of simple neurons, points out <a
href="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/l/www/admin/faclist/dughof.html">Douglas
R. Hofstadter</a> of the University of Indiana.

<P>So humans have their unique uses after all. Intel will not,
it seems, be coming out with a replacement for your brain
anytime soon.<P>

Artificial intelligence has yet to produce the HALs and C3POs that science fiction writers envisioned. But the Internet is becoming a great breeding ground for bots (sometimes also known as spiders or worms)--"smart" programs that carry out simple tasks online. BotSpot features a selection of some of the more clever or useful bots, among them Eliza, an interactive psychotherapist program developed at MIT in 1966. The list of "New Bots" includes links to other bot indexes such as the concise <a href="http://www.student.toplinks.com/hp/sjlaven/">ChatterBot Library</a>. The "FAQs" link helpfully, if somewhat confusingly, leads to a wealth of journals, conferences and research sources regarding intelligent software.

<BR>
<B>To the American Public,----</B>
<P>
Patrons and Friends:
<P>
Having the pleasure of again appearing before you, though under a new title, and in new dress, we may be expected to advance some remarks on things in general, and particularly on the subject of our motives, intentions and prospects. Since the discontinuance of the "American Mechanic"--the "Elevator" of Cincinnati, "American Protector" of Hartford, and "N. Y. State Mechanic" of Albany, having previously retired,--we have been frequently solicited by enterprising mechanics, and others, to engage in the publication of a new scientific paper, for the advancement of more extensive intelligence in Arts and Trades in general, but more particularly in the several new, curious and useful arts, which have but recently been discovered and introduced. We have, moreover, received communications from various sections of the country, and especially from the South and West, expressing the opinion that a paper of this description was wanted, and would be well received and extensively patronized, if once introduced. With this encouragement, we have made arrangements to furnish the intelligent and liberal workingmen, and those who delight in the development of those beauties of Nature, which consist in the laws of Mechanics, Chemistry, and other branches of Natural Philosophy--with a paper that will instruct while it diverts or amuses them, and will retain its excellence and value, when political and ordinary newspapers are thrown aside and forgotten.
</P>
<P>
In conducting this publication, we shall endeavour to avoid all expressions of sentiment, on any sectional, sectarian, or political party subject; but shall exercise a full share of independence, in the occasional exposure of ignorance and knavery, especially when we find them sheltered by arrogance and aristocracy. We shall present no gloomy catalogues of crime and depravity, believing that the cause of neither happiness nor morality will be thereby promoted;--our object being to please and enlighten. We shall advocate the pure Christian religion, without favouring any particular sect; and shall make it a point to adhere to reason and common sense, independently of the opinions of those, whose interests and popularity depend on their rigid adherence to traditional doctrines, and church creeds.
</P>
<P>
With these sentiments and intentions, respected Friends and 'Sovereign People,' and with full confidence in your good-will and generous support--not in the least doubting, however, that you will consult your own interests quite as much as ours in the matter--we commend to your favour and patronage the "SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN."

<A NAME="terms"><B>TERMS</B></A>
<BR>
Editors and Publishers.
<BR>
We shall send copies of our first number to several of our most respected cotemporaries, and would solicit their aid in notifying the mechanics of their vicinities, of the existence of the S. American. Those who will give our advertisement (head of our first page,) an insertion in their columns, shall be entitled to two copies of our paper, by which they will each have one copy to preserve and another to clip, as occasion may require; or, if they prefer it, we will send a dollar in cash for the insertion. Those who may volunteer to act as agents for this paper, may retain of the money received, 25 cents as commission, for each subscriber obtained.
<BR>
SECURE THE FIRST NUMBER.--Three dollars per volume is offered for the first volume of the "New York Mechanic," complete, and 25 cents per number, for several of the early numbers, by those who neglected to subscribe for the work in season to secure the first numbers. Thus it will be with the Scientific American; hundreds of people will wish for it in vain, when the first numbers are out. In anticipation of this circumstance, we shall print a few hundred more copies than are as yet ordered; but not more than will probably be taken up in two or three weeks.
<BR>
EVERY SUBSCRIBER AN AGENT.--We have often observed in sectarian papers, a general request that all clergymen of the same denomination, should act as agents for the paper; and by such means, some papers have attained to an immense circulation. Not having any similar available advantage, we would solicit the favour of every honest mechanic who may receive this paper, to use his influence in our favour, and induce as many more as possible to subscribe for it. All favours of this kind will be duly appreciated.
<BR>
POSTMASTERS who may receive this number, are requested to present it to some mechanic who will pay its postage, and shew the paper to others. Any postmaster who may procure and forward the names of three subscribers, will be entitled to the volume free.
<BR>
OUR ADVERTISEMENT.--Every person who looks at this paper, is particularly requested to examine our advertisement at the head of the first column, on the first page.
<BR>
TERMS.--The "Scientific American" will be furnished to subscribers at $2.00 per annum,--one dollar in advance, and the balance in six months.
<BR>
Five copies will be sent to one address six months, for four dollars in advance.
<BR>
REMITTING MONEY.--Our subscribers who receive their papers by mail, will remit one dollar each by mail on the receipt of the second number of this paper. Those who reside in cities, will pay to such agents only as may produce written authority from the publisher, to collect the same. This rule, however, will not interfere with those voluntary agents who may procure a few subscribers amongst their associates and acquaintance, and remit the money by mail.
<BR>
Any person procuring two or more subscribers, will be entitled to a commission of 25 cents each.
<BR>
Each number will be furnished with from two to five original Engravings, many of them elegant, and illustrative of New Inventions, Scientific Principles, and Curious Works; and will contain, in addition to the most interesting news of passing events, general notices of the progress of Mechanical and other Scientific Improvements ; American and Foreign Improvements and Inventions; Catalogues of American Patents; Scientific Essays, illustrative of the principles of the sciences of Mechanics, Chemistry and Architecture; useful information and instruction in various Arts and Trades; Curious Philosophical Experiments; Miscellaneous Intelligence, Music and Poetry.
<BR>
This paper is especially entitled to the patronage of Mechanics and Manufacturers, being the only paper in America, devoted to the interests of those classes; but is particularly useful to farmers, as it will not only apprise them of improvements in agricultural implements, but instruct them in various mechanical trades, and guard them against impositions. As a family newspaper, it will convey more useful intelligence to children and young people, than five times its cost in school instruction. Another important argument in favour of this paper, is that it will be worth two dollars at the end of the year when the volume is complete, (Old volumes of the New York Mechanic, being now worth double the original cost, in cash.)

<A NAME="#poem"><B>Wife, Children and Friends.</B></A>
If the stock of our bliss be in stranger hands vested,
The fund, ill secured, oft in bankruptcy ends;
But the heart issues bills which are never protested,
When drawn on the firm of--wife, children and friends.
Though valour still glows in life's dying embers,
The death-wounded tar, who his colours defends,
Drops a tear of regret as he, dying, remembers
How blest was his home with--wife, children and friends.
The soldier, whose deeds live immortal in story,
Whom duty to far distant latitude sends,
With transport would barter whole ages of glory
For one happy day with--wife, children, and friends.
The day-spring of youth, still unclouded by sorrow,
Alone on itself for enjoyment depends;
But drear is the twilight of age, if it borrow
No warmth from the smile of--wife, children, and friends.
Let the breath of renown ever freshen and nourish
The laurel which o'er the dead favourite bends,
O'er me wave the willow, and long may it flourish,
Bedewed with the tears of--wife, children, and friends!
<B>Attraction.</B>
Attraction is a curious power,
That none can understand:
Its influence is every where--
In water, air and land;
It keeps the earth compact and tight,
As though strong bolts were through it;
And, what is more mysterious yet,
It binds us mortals to it.
You throw a stone up in the air,
And down it comes--ker-whack!
The centrifugal casts it up--
The centripetal--back.
My eyes! I can't discover how
One object 'tracts another;
Unless they love each other, like
A sister and a brother.
I know the compass always points
Directly at the pole:
Some say the north star causes this,
And some say--Symm's Hole!
Prehaps it does--prehaps it don't;
Prehaps some other cause;
Keep on prehapsing--who can solve
Attraction's hidden laws?
A fly lights on a 'lasses cup--
Attraction bids him woo it;
And, when he's in, attraction keeps
The chap from paddling through it.
Attraction lures the sot to drink,
To all his troubles drown;
But when his legs give way, he falls,
And 'traction keeps him down.
Attraction is a curious power,
That none can understand:
Its influence is everywhere--
In water, air and land.
It operates on every thing--
The sea, the tides, the weather;
And sometimes draws the sexes up,
And binds them fast together.

<A NAME="rail">IMPROVED RAIL-ROAD CARS<BR></A>
There is, perhaps, no mechanical subject, in which improvement has advanced so rapidly, within the last ten years, as that of railroad passenger cars. Let any person contrast the awkward and uncouth cars of '35 with the superbly splendid long cars now running on several of the eastern roads, and he will find it difficult to convey to a third party, a correct idea of the vast extent of improvement. Some of the most elegant cars of this class, and which are of a capacity to accommodate from sixty to eighty passengers, and run with a steadiness hardly equalled by a steamboat in still water, are manufactured by Davenport & Bridges, at their establishment in Cambridgeport, Mass. The manufacturers have recently introduced a variety of excellent improvements in the construction of trucks, springs, and connections, which are calculated to avoid atmospheric resistance, secure safety and convenience, and contribute ease and comfort to passengers, while flying at the rate of 30 or 40 miles per hour. We purpose to give a particular description of these improvements, accompanied with suitable engravings, in our next number, that our readers may be enabled to appreciate more fully the progress of improvements in this important branch of mechanism.

<A NAME="lowell">
LOWELL AS IT WAS AND AS IT IS;<BR> 
By Rev. HENRY A. MILES, is a neat 18mo of 234 pages just issued by Powers & Bagley, Lowell. It is full of facts of general interest. We learn from it that the Merrimac Company (whose dividends are so often quoted) employs 1250 women, whose average earnings considerably exceed $2 each per week above the cost of their board. The laboring men average 85 cents per day above their board; fifty-six overseers receive $2 each per day with occasional premiums. [These are the reduced wages we hear of.] None are employed under fifteen years of age. No woman is retained a day after she is known to be guilty of licentious conduct, but not one in a hundred is ever discharged for any such cause. The average running time is 12 hours 10 minutes per day, which is too long and should be shortened, but the average working time of each hand is but ten hours and a half. In the Boott Mills, a careful account of working time has been kept, and it appears that 106 girls averaged 267 days each in a year and 10 hours 8 minutes per day, each being paid according to her work, and all are paid in cash every month,--not one farthing in store orders, or barter of any kind. The average earnings of the women in all the factories, including novices, is $1,93 per week besides their board. Many girls who have been school teachers gladly take places in the mills, as the pay is higher here, and the work lighter, though the hours are longer. No one has lost a sixpence of her earnings in the Lowell factories since the first was started. The girls have about $100,000 in the Savings Bank.
<BR>--Such is the condition of the Laboring Class in the principal Manufacturing town in America. Granted that it is not all it should be--that it might and should be improved--it is still true that no where else does a Laboring class of equal numbers earn so much, year by year; no where else are they so constantly employed, comfortably situated and adequately rewarded. Let those who would overthrow this state of things go to work and build up something better, or show how it may be done. Until they have some crude notions of this sort, ought they not to cease their incessant warfare on American Manufacturers?--"Tribune."

<A NAME="horn">
MAKING ARTICLES IN HORN.<BR>
--The handles for knives, razors, and other articles moulded in horn, are thus made: The horn is first cut into appropriate pieces with the saw, and when heated, these are prepared with a knife or spoke-shave, to the general form and size required; after which the pieces are pressed into moulds. An idea of the mould will be conveyed by imagining two dies or pieces of metal, parallel on their outer surfaces, and with a cavity sunk entirely in the one, or partially in each, according to circumstances: it is made either straight, curved, twisted, rounded, bevelled, &c., of it is engraved with some device, according to the pattern of the work to be produced. The pressure is applied to the dies by enclosing them in a kind of clamp made with a strong pair of nut crackers, but with a powerful screw at the end opposite to the joint; the mould, dies, and horn, are dipped into boiling water or a few minutes, and then screwed as fast as possible immediately on removing the same, and in about twenty minutes the work is ready for finishing; some handles are made of two pieces joined together.

<A NAME="smoke">
A SMOKE FILTER FOR LOCOMOTIVES.<BR> 
--An invention, which promises to be one of great utility, has been recently made by Mr. J. P. Dempfil, a French gentleman, of much scientific talent.--The invention consists of "an attachment" to the chimney of a locomotive, dividing it by a partition in two parts or passages, upward and downward, with a flywheel at the bottom of the downward draft, and a layer of gravel or sand underneath the wheel. The top of the chimney is closed, and the smoke and cinders pass upward through one passage to the top, then descending through the other, (a strong draught being made by the revolution of the flywheel, which is put in motion by the steam,) and all the refuse of the smoke pipe is retained by the grand filter, and the heated air again passes into the furnaces.
</P>
<P>
<A NAME="burning">
BURNING WELL.<BR>
--A correspondent of the Cleveland Plain Dealer, gives an account of a burning well that may be seen at Southington Centre, in Trumbull county, Ohio. The well is 91 feet deep, all but 24 feet through sand-stone, quick-sand and hard rock, which the augur used for boring could not penetrate. When it was withdrawn, a peculiar odor, accompanied by a rushing sound, was perceived. Suspecting the presence of inflammable gas, Mr. Wannemaker, the owner of the well, lowered a lamp into it. A violent explosion that did some injury to the by-standers, was the consequence, and the gas still continues to burn. It is doubtless carburetted hydrogen.
</P>
<P>
<A NAME="export">
NEW ARTICLE OF EXPORT.<BR>
--We are told that a Yankee broom maker in Ohio has leased some twelve hundred acres of bottom land, on the Scioto river, near Columbus, and planted the entire plot in broom corn, with a view to export the crop to England, where he intends to proceed himself, and engage extensively in the manufacturing of brooms, taking with him the wood for the handles, and the machinery used for the purpose. Brooms made from the American broom corn are so much superior, for various uses, to any thing to be had in England, that they have become, within a few years past, quite a favorite in that country and are now exported thither in large quantities.--"Ex. paper."
</P>

<A NAME="phenomenon">
EXTRAORDINARY PHENOMENON.<BR>
--The inhabitants of the village of Moulton were greatly astonished on Saturday last, at observing a considerable quantity of hay (from a field where it was in cocks for stacking) rise rapidly into the air. There was not the slightest breeze of wind perceptible at the time: however the hay continued to ascend until it apparently passed through the clouds, which were sailing high at the time. After the lapse of a few minutes it again appeard like a small black streak in the cloudy vapour, where it continued to form a most novel and extraordinary sight for ten or fifteen minutes, when it gradually descended again to the earth.--"Linconshire Chronicle."

<A NAME="oregon">
IMPROVEMENT IN OREGON.<BR>
--Already has a canal been commenced around the dangerous falls in the Columbia river, at Willamette, by Dr. McLauglin, an American citizen. Its length will be about half a mile, part of the way through a solid bed of primitive rock, and the fall in the entire distance will be about thirty-five feet. The projector expects to complete the work in two years, at a cost of thirty thousand dollars. His charter, procured from the Oregon Legislature is for twenty-one years. It is said that the improvement which will be effected in the navigation of the Columbia, by this construction of the canal will, of itself, fully reward the community for the privilege conferred by the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
<A NAME="portrait">
PORTRAIT PAINTING.<BR>
--A portrait painter in large practice might write a pretty book on the vanity and singularity of his sitters. A certain man came to Copely, and had himself, his wife and seven children all included in a family piece. "It was but one thing," said he, "and that is the portrait of my first wife--for this one is my second." "But," said the artist, "she is dead you know, sir; what can I do? she is only to be admitted as an angel." "Oh, no! not at all," answered the other; "she must come in as a woman--no angels for me." The portrait was added, but some time elapsed before the person came back; when he returned, he had a stranger lady on his arm, "I must have another cast of your hand, Copely," he said; "an accident befell my second wife; this lady is my third, and she is come to have her likeness included in the family picture." The painter complied--the likeness was introduced--and the husband looked with a glance of satisfaction on his three spouses. Not so the lady; she remonstrated; never was such a thing heard of--out her predecessors must go. The artist painted them out accordingly, and had to bring an action at law to obtain payment for the portraits which he had obliterated.--"Life of Copely, Family Library."
</P>
<P>
<A NAME="improve">
GREAT IMPROVEMENT IN LITHOGRAPHIC PRINTING.<BR>
--A very important improvement has been made in the lithographic printing machine by a young French engineer named Nicolle, by which the same precision and regularity of pressure is obtained as by the common hand-press. By the common lithographic process, not more than from 200 to 250 good impressions of designs, or about 1,000 copies of lithographic writing, can be obtained in twelve hours; by this new machine, which is also worked by hand, as many as 2,000 of the former, and 20,000 of the latter, can be obtained within the same period of time.
</P>
<P><A NAME="horse">
A SENSIBLE HORSE.<BR>
--One of the truck horses of Mr. Hinds was unloosed for a minute or two, from the trucks, a few days since, in this city, when, on the driver looking around for him, behold he was missing. It was an hour or two, before the driver could discover his whereabout. It was very mysterious, he being a steady beast, and not subject to flights of fancy. However, he was at last found in the smith's shop, where he was wont to have his shoes repaired. The smith said the horse entered and took the usual stand for shoeing. Upon examining his feet he found one shoe off, which he supplied. That horse is a sensible beast.

<P>
<A NAME="zinc">
THE PROPERTIES OF ZINC.<BR>
--Professor Farraday, as we are informed in the London Athenaeum, has made this metal the subject of many interesting experiments. He has discovered that it assumes new properties on being melted and poured into water, the metal becoming very malleable and soft, losing none of its tenacity, but still capable of being spun into the finest wire, pressed into any required form, or rolled into any thinness desired. This promises to be a very useful discovery.

A SPECIMENT OF VEGETABLE SILK,<BR> 
raised from seeds received from Italy, which came originally from Syria, has been presented to the National Institute. Some of the seeds have been forwarded to Florida to the Hon. D. Levy, for the purpose of being cuitivated.
</P>
<P>
<A NAME="thunder">
CAUSE OF SOUND IN THUNDER.--Thunder is one of the consequences resulting from lightning, and lightning appears to be occasioned by the combustion of some of the inflamable particles of air; or according to more recent opinions, of a condensation of aerial matter conducing to electricity, by which in either case, a vacum is created. The sorrounding atoms which remain uninfluenced by this change, being forced together by the whole weight of the atmosphere, greatly constrict each other; but their elastic nature causes them immediately to expand, and by this enlargement their sonorous property is acquired. A centrifugal force being thus established, it acts in all directions alike; but as the circle extends, its propulsive power becomes gradually diminished, till at last its pressure is no longer felt, nor sound created. The rumbling noise of thunder is produced by that portion of the sonorous circle which strikes upon the earth, whence it becomes condensed; and, being intercepted in its upward course by dense masses of vapor, it is again reflected, and this alternate motion and reverbration continue, until the interuption ceases, or the original force is exhausted. Echo is occasioned also by reverbration from one cloud to ahother.--"Webster's Principles of Sound."
</P>
<P>
<A NAME="liquor">
LIQUOR BURNT.<BR>
--Among the property destroyed by the late fire, in this city, was a large quantity of intoxicating liquors, for which nobody ought to mourn. It is announced that 912 pipes of brandy, 200 pipes of gin, 100 puncheons of rum, 2000 pipes; half and quarter pipes of Madeira wine, 3000 casks of port wine, 1000 Malaga, 1500 Marseilles, 1000 claret, and 5000 baskets of Champaigne were consumed. How much more that is not told of, on account of the little sympathy the tale would excite, is not known. The operations of sundry large wine merchants are also rudely put a stop to.--"N. Y. Evangelist."

<A NAME="poem2"><B>Speak Gently</B></A>
Speak gently!--It is better far
To rule by love than fear:
Speak gently!--let not harsh words mar
The good we might do here!
Speak gently!--Love doth whisper low
The vows that true hearts bind;
And gently friendship's accents flow;
Affliction's voice is kind.
Speak gently to the little child!
Its love be sure to gain:
Teach it in accents soft and mild:--
It may not long remain.
Speak gently to the young, for they
Will have enough to bear--
Pass through this life as best they may,
'Tis full of anxious care!
Speak gently to the aged one,
Grieve not the care-worn heart;
The sands of life are nearly run--
Let such in peace depart!
Speak gently, kindly, to the poor,
Let no harsh tone be heard;
They have enough they must endure,
Without an unkind word!
Speak gently to the erring--know,
They may have toil'd in vain;
Perchance unkindness made them so;
Oh, win them back again!
Speak gently!--He who gave his life
To bend man's stubborn will,
When elements were in fierce strife,
Said to them, "Peace, be still!"
Speak gently!--'tis a little thing
Dropp'd in the heart's deep well;
The good, the joy which it may bring,
Eternity shall tell.
<B>'Tis said that Wine will cheer the Heart.</B>
AIR--'Tis said that absence conquers love.
'Tis said that wine will cheer the heart,
But oh! believe it not;
Touch not the cup, 'twill leave a smart,
Which cannot be forgot.
The wine cup as it passes round,
Is hailed with jovial cheer,
But soon, alas, is changed the sound,
The smile becomes a tear.
Too many hearts have felt the sting,
That lurks within the bowl;
And many hearts it yet will wring,
Who heed not its controul.
But take the warning ere too late,
And leave that cup of wo,
And seek a better, happier fate,
That wine can e'er bestow.
Nature has given in plenteous streams,
The beverage of the rose,
To drink the dew that on them gleams,
The flowers their leaves unclose.
Then why should ye not drink the same,
And leave the ruby wine;
It will not rob thee of thy name,
Nor leave thy heart to pine.
<B>"FOR OF SUCH IS THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN."</B>
BY PHAZMA.
A blind old beggar, with his hat in hand,
Neglected by the lazy passers-by,
I noticed shyly at the corner stand,
With moisture falling from his sightless eye.
A child came by--a laughing little creature--
With joy and innocence in every feature--
Skipping forth gaily to an apple-stand,
She saw the beggar, and became less gay;
Then flung the bit of silver in her hand
Into the old man's hat, and ran away!

<H3><A NAME="steamship">THE STEAM-SHIP GREAT BRITAIN</A></H3>
<BR>
This mammoth of the ocean, which has recently arrived from Liverpool, has created much excitement here as well as in Europe; being in fact the greatest maratime curiosity ever seen in our harbour. She was built by the Great Western Steam-Ship Company, at Bristol, England. Her keel was laid in July, 1839, and she was launched in July, 1844, with her engines and machinery on board. She is composed entirely of iron, which renders her perfectly safe against accidents by fire, and even an explosion of her steam-boilers could not sink her, as she is divided into five different compartments, each being thoroughly water-tight, so that in case of accident even one perfect division would float the vessel and cargo. The length of the keel is 290 feet; total length 322 feet; beams 51 feet; depth 32 feet 6 inches. She has four decks, the upper one being flush, and is 308 feet long; the second deck consists of two promenade saloons, one of which is 110 feet long by 22 wide. The third deck consists of dining saloons, the first of which is 96 by 30 feet. The saloons are 8 feet 3 inches high and surrounded with berths, of which there are sufficint to accommodate 252 persons. Her burden is 3,600 tons, and her engines are capable of working 1,000 horse powers. She has four engines united, which with the boilers, weigh 540 tons. The main shaft is 28 inches in diameter in the centre, and 24 inches in the bearings, and weighs nearly 16 tons. The power of the engines is applied to a single submerged propeller, on the screw principle, and 15 feet 6 inches in diameter. The engines and boilers occupy a space of 80 feet in the middle portion of the vessel; the boilers are heated by 24 fires, and will contain 2,00 tons of water. She has six masts, four of which are hinged for lowering when head winds set in; the masts are made of iron, having iron wire rigging, so that very little surface is presented to the resistance of the atmosphere; the quantity of canvas carried, is about 4,900 square yards. Upwards of 1,500 tons of iron have been used in her construction; her draught of water is about 16 feet, and the displacement of water, equal to 3,200 tons.
<BR>
The Great Britain was visited while at Liverpool by 33,000 persons, and probably by an equal number at London. During the few days since her arrival at New York, she has been visited by about 12,000 people, who have paid 25 cents for the gratification. If there is any thing objectional in the construction or machinery of this noble ship, it is the mode of propelling her by the screw propeller; and we should not be surprised if it should be, ere long, superceded by paddle wheels at the sides; as there can be little doubt that such an improvement would increase her speed to 18 miles per hour, and render her the swiftest ship on the ocean.

<H3>First Principles of Mechanics</H3>
<BR>
The science of mechanics, in its most extensive sense embraces a large proportion of what is termed Natural Philosophy, or the system of laws which govern the various operations of Nature. It investigates the laws and effects of Inertia, force, motion, momentum, equilibrium, gravity, &c.
<BR>
Inertia is that which constitutes in all bodies or substances, a tendency when at rest, to remain at rest; and when in motion to continue in motion independent of any force or power. But as every moving body is supposed to have been put in motion by some moving power, its inertia in this case becomes momentum.
<BR>
If a round ball is placed on a table that is perfectly level, it will remain a rest, and will require the application of power or force to put it in motion; but when this ball is put in motion, it will require some resistance to stop its motion.
<BR>
Gravity is that property which consists in all bodies a tendency to move towards each other, and especially, towards the centre of the earth; it is always in direct proportion to inertia. Gravity is generally considered to be merely the attraction of the earth; it consists of the force by which bodies descend towards the earth when suspended, or are let go from a height; and this force constitutes weight.
<BR>
If a ball be suspended by a cord, it will uniformly hold the cord in a position at right angles with the surface of the earth. If the point from which the ball is suspended be fixed, and the ball be removed any distance from its natural position, it will, when liberated, return to its natural position directly under the point of suspension; but in this instance, it will not readily stop at the point of its natural position; but having received an impulse from the force of gravity, its momentum will force it some distance beyond the given point, until this momentum is again overcome by gravity: then gravity again impels it in a contrary direction, and it is again carried beyond by its inertia. Thus a vibratory motion is for some time continued, before the ball becomes stationary. Here are illustrated by one example, Gravity, Inertia, Motion and Momentum.

<CENTER><A NAME="chemistry"><H2>CHEMISTRY</H2></A></CENTER>
<BR>
We propose to give, in a series of brief essays, such explanations and illustrations of the principles and peculiarities of the science of chemistry as may be the most immediately applicable to the arts and trades, the most useful to mechanics, and the most interesting to the curious, and readers in general.
<BR>
Chemistry developes the composition and properties of bodies, and the combination of the various ingredients of which they are composed; also, the effects of one substance on another, and the art of decomposing, recomposing, separating and combining them, in such a manner as to examine minutely the several ingredients of which bodies are composed, and by new combinations thereof, to form or produce other substances entirely different from the original. There is no art or science by which a man can accomplish a work of creation with so much verity, as by chemistry. Liquids are changed to solids, and dry substances to liquids, and then again to air or gasses. Metallic bodies are reduced to earths; thence to transparent crystals or glass; thence to transparent liquids, and next to thin air, whence they may be again precipitated and restored to their original brilliant metallic state. From a limpid fluid, like water, a chemist will produce a marble statue; a silver urn; an iron bolt; or a glass decanter; also, paints of various brilliant and durable colors, such as vermillion, prussian blue, chrome yellow, french green, spanish brown, red lead and white lead. The precious metals, gold and silver, are extracted from the lustreless rock, and appear in dazzling brilliancy; again, they are made to take the form of transparent fluid, or in the more invisible gaseous form, float off in the passing breeze. Such is chemistry; and we feel assured that this sublime and interesting science would not be long neglected by mechanics and working men, if they could first be made aware of the utility of a knowledge of its principles, and the beauties and wonders of nature which are thereby brought to view.

This wonder of the age, which has for several months past been in operation between Washington and Baltimore, appears likely to come into general use through the length and breadth of our land. Arrangements are already made for extending the lines to Philadelphia, New York, Albany, Buffalo, Springfield, Boston, and various other cities and sections. Hon. Amos Kendall, Ex-Postmaster General, has taken the management of the invention,--whether as proprietor or agent we are not informed,--while the inventor is on a tour to Russia. We shall take an early opportunity to give our readers a full and minute description of this invention, with explanations and illustrations of its principles; but in consequence of the press and variety of matter which presses on this our first number, we are constrained to defer it. We will add the remark, however, that it is contemplated by the merchants of our Western states, to communicate their orders for goods, &c. by means of the telegraph, instead of abiding the slow and tedious progress of rail-road cars.

<B>DAGUERREOTYPE CAMERA.</B> M. Martiner has stated to the French Academy of Science, that he has discovered the means of carrying on the Daguerreotype process on a gigantic scale, as compared with what is now done. He can, he says, Daguerreotype an entire panorama, embracing 150 degrees. His process consists in curving the metallic plate, and causing the lens which reflects the landscape to turn by clock-work. The lens, in turning, passes over on one side the whole space to be Daguerreotyped, and on the other side moves the refracted luminous cone to the plate, to which the objects are successively conveyed.

Mr. Joseph Hurd, of Shoreham, Vt. has secured <B>Letters Patent</B>, for an apparatus for separating or clarifying liquids by application of centrifugal force. It is a well-known fact that mucilage or sugar, as well as mineral and saline substances, have a greater specific gravity than water, though the particles thereof, will not readily separate from water by mere force of gravity: but when a mixed fluid, or turbid water is put into a violent rotary motion, in a cask or cylinder, the centrifugal force will drive the heavier particles to the sides of the vessel, while the clear water remains in the centre.
<BR><BR>
<B>A NEW INVENTION FOR CLEANING COTTON</B>, completed by Mr. Philip Ault, of Natches is composed of a wire cylinder within a box, in which revolves a shaft with arms capped with rails; from the rails spikes or pins project, which separate the locks containing the seeds from each other, knock out the trash and dust, and pass the cleaned cotton over the cylinder down into the gin stand. The shaft is driven by the same power that drives the gin requiring but little force. It is a valuable assistant to the Planter.
<BR><BR>
<B>INDIA RUBBER</B> There is no end to the many valuable objects to which India Rubber may be applied. A new one has been discovered, and that is the inner sheathing of ships, where sheathing paper is now used in small sheets and where this new rubber can be applied in wide strips extending the entire length of the vessel. The rubber being indestructible and impervious to water, renders it an additonal means of preventing leaks, while sand spread over it puts an end to all ravages of insects that infest salt water.
<BR><BR>
<B>AN IMPROVED COTTON-GIN</B>A. M. Groat is about introducing a Gin for long staple Sea Island cotton. It is expected to clean at least, 100 pounds per day, whereas the gins now in use will clean only about 25 pounds. The seed is separated without breaking.
<BR><BR>
<B>A NEW MACHINE FOR BREAKING STONE</B>, has been lately constructed at Brooklyn. Its construction is on the principle of a large hammer or beater, operated by a moveable steam-engine. It is intended for the West Indies, to be used in McAdamizing roads.
<BR><BR>
We would invite our readers to look at the advertisement headed <B>"RARE PROJECT."</B> There is real benevolence to men, in the plan proposed. As success must attend some of the inventions, and much gain may follow at little risk, it commends itself to all who desire human improvement. We gladly commend, not only the project, but also the company, as worthy the confidence of the public.

<B><FONT SIZE="+1">To Write In Various Colours With The Same Pen, Ink, And Paper</FONT></B>--Take a sheet of paper and wet some parts of it with a solution of sub-carbonate of potas, which must be diluted with water so as not to appear on the paper when dry. Wet some other parts with diluted muratic acid, or with juice of lemons. Some other parts may be wet with a diluted solution of alum; and others with an infusion of nut-galls (water in which bruised or pulverized nut-galls have been steeped.) None of these preparations must be so strong as to colour the paper any. When these are dry, take some finely powdered sulphate of iron, and rub it lightly on some parts of the paper, that have been wet with the subcarbonate of potas and infusion of galls. Then with the juice of violets, or of the leaves of red cabbage, write on the paper as usual with a pen. The ink is of itself a faint purple; where the paper was wet with acid, the writing will be bright red; on the sub-carbonate of potas, it will take a beautiful green; on the alum it will be brown; on the sub-carbonate of potas that was rubbed with powdered sulphate of iron, it will be deep yellow; and on the infusion of galls that was rubbed with powder, it will be black. The juice of violets will take a brilliant yellow on the alkali if it be very strong. The juice of violets or red cabbage may be kept a long time by means of the addition of a few drops of alcohol; or the leaves may be dried by the fire, and thus may be kept ready for use; and it is only requisite to steep them in hot water, in order to prepare the ink at any time.

<B><FONT SIZE="+1">To Wash Brass Or Copper With Silver</FONT></B>--To half an ounce of nitric acid in a phial, add one ounce of water, and one-fourth of an ounce of good silver. It will soon be dissolved, and if the acid and metal are both pure, the solution (which is called nitrate of silver) will be transparant and colourless. Add to this a solution of nearly two drachms of muriate of soda, in any quantity of water; this will precipitate the silver in a white opaque mass. Pour off the water with the acid, and add to the silver an equal quantity of super-tartrate of pota , thus forming a soft paste; dip a piece of soft leather in this paste, and rub it on the metal to be silvered; continue rubbing it till it is nearly dry; then wash it with water, and polish by rubbing it hard with a piece of dry leather. Another method is, to add sub-carbonate of potas to the nitrate of silver, as ebullition ensues; then the acid is poured off, and the precipitate (which is white at first, but becomes green when dry) is mixed with double its quantity of muriate of soda, and super-tartrate of potas. With this composition, being moistened, the metal is rubbed over, &c.

Ten thousand clocks have been sent from one house in Boston. Cotton goods of various kinds have been shipped in considerable quantities, and we know of several articles which might be, and soon will be exported with great advantage.

It is reported that a bale of goods recently arrived at Quebec, from England was stamped "Saco, Me."

We doubt whether any event or circumstance has transpired within the present century, which has served to develope the ignorance and gullibility, of the citizens of New York, to so great an extent, as that of the introduction of Signor Muzzi's contrivance for aerial locomotion. We have indeed been distressed with mingled sensations of regret and vexation, to witness the applause of several of the most popular city papers, and the names of several of our professors of sciences, and men of reputed scientific attainments, appended to a certificate of commendation of a contrivance, the futility of which is so palpable at first sight, that a school boy of nine years would be censurable for dullness if he could not readily detect it. But without proceeding further with our own opinion, we will present an illustrated description of the apparatus to our readers, that they may exercise their own judgment on the subject:
<BR>
This cut sufficiently represents the machine; which consists of a balloon or ball, (A) made of oiled silk or paper, and filled with hydrogen gas. To this balloon are attached two inclined planes (B B) which are also constucted of light material and secured in their position with cords. In addition there is a triangular vane, tail, or rudder (C) by which the machine is steered on the principle of a helm. The plan, or mode of operating the machine, is to supply it with a sufficient quantity of gas to cause it to ascend, while the inclined planes, encountering some degree of atmospheric resistance, naturally shoot off in an oblique direction, drawing the balloon with them. Then, when the machine has ascended to a sufficient height, a part of the gas is to be let off or compressed, so as to cause the balloon to descend, and by a simple contrivance, the position of the two planes is reversed, the depressed ends being brought to the front, they give the balloon an oblique direction in its descent. Thus, by ascending a mile and again descending, a mile of horizontal distance is gained; and if the atmosphere be entirely calm, a mile may be travelled about as quick as a lame man would walk the same distance. But if there be the least breeze of head wind, the game is up. And by what means the balloon is to be made to again ascend, without a fresh supply of gas, the inventor has not informed us--perhaps he does not exactly know.
<BR>
Such, gentle reader, is the invention which has been lauded by our first men and biggest editors, and of which an awkward model has received "rounds of applause" from a "select and fashionable audience" (who paid fifty eents each to witness the wonder,) as the nearest approach to successful aerial navigation that has ever been thought of, notwithstanding that ten years ago, in a popular public journal of this city,--and again four years ago, in another city paper,--a plan was presented to them, with ample illustrations, explanations and demonstrations of an aerial apparatus, on perfectly rational and established principles, that will evidently navigate the atmosphere at a speed of one hundred miles per hour, with safety, and perfectly at command; being in the form of an eliptic spindle, with a buoyancy of several tons, and driven forward by the power of steam, applied to revolving, spiral fan-wheels.* Why then, it may be asked, has this new plan produced so much excitement, amongst the very people who appeared totally indifferent to the rational plan? The answer is, simply, that the scientific plan was introduced by an American, while the new apparatus was invented by an Italian gentlemen,--the audience knowing but little of the merits of either.
<BR>
With regard to the inventor,--Signor Muzzi,--he appears to be an unassuming gentleman, desirous of procuring assistance to put his invention in successful operation on a large scale. In this we may well sympathise with him, and heartily wish him all possible success: but we should be glad to have our citizens of scientific pretensions, become better informed in the principles of natural philosophy, than they have manifested on this occasion.
<BR>
We had intended to add some remarks on Mr. West's eloquent lecture on this subject, but must defer them till next week.

<FONT SIZE="+1"><B><A NAME="electro">Electro-Plating</A></B></FONT>
<BR>
This incomprehensible art, which has been in use about three years, is truly valuable and must prevail extensively, notwithstanding the disadvantage to which its reputatiou has been subjected, in consequence of the many impositions practised on the public, by the unprincipled speculators. Having been the first to introduce this art in the city of New York, we have had opportunity for more experience in the business, probable, than any other person in the country; and can say with confidence, that either gold-plating or silvering can be executed by the electro process, with greater beauty and permanence than can be done by the old process, yet at less than one half the expense. But there is a much deeper and extensive knowledge of the art required, than is usually attained by ordinary practitioners, in order to insure durability as well as beauty, though there is in reality, no difficulty in effecting it. Even iron, steel or pewter may be plated directly with silver, which will firmly unite with the surfaces. It is well known that many young men have paid fifty dollars cash for a mere superficial knowledge of the art; but it is our intention to give in future numbers, such minute and complete instructions in the various branches of this art, and of the requisite apparatus, that any attentive reader may acquire the art, more perfectly than has been hitherto understood by those who have paid high prices for instruction.

<BR>
It frequently occurs, that substances of different colours or even without colour, by coming in contact, produce colours very different from that of either of the ingredients when separate; thus, if a sheet of paper be striped in one direction with a hair pencil dipped in a solution of sub-carbonate of potas; and then crossed with a solution of sulphuric acid, diluted with five times as much water, it will be colourless; but dip it in a mixture of a weak solution of sulphate of iron, and infusion of nut galls, and it will instantly become a beautiful plaid; the ground being purple, striped one way with black and crossed with white.
<BR>
If a similar paper be striped with sub-carbonate of potas and crossed with infusion of galls, and afterwards dipped in a solution of sulphate of iron, it will become purple, yellow, black and white.
<BR>
Stain some parts of a sheet of paper a purple brown, with a mixture of infusion of galls and sulphate of iron: stain other parts green with a mixture of tinctures of turmeric and litmus; stain other parts purple with juice of red cabbage; other parts red, with tincture of litmus and muriatic acid; other parts yellow with tincture of turmeric; wash the remainder of the sheet with a solution of sulphate of iron, which will remain white. Then print or draw with a camel-hair pencil, any figure or figures on every part of the paper, with a solution of sub-carbonate of potas. On the purple brown, the figure will be black; on the green it will be purple; on the purple it will be green; on the red it will be blue; on the yellow, red; and on the white it will take a yellow colour. Thus the figure will appear in colours different from the ground in every part.
<BR>
Immerse a piece of white cotton in a solution of sulphate of iron--it will remain white: dip another piece in tincture of turmeric, it will take a yellow; wet another piece with juice of red cabbage, containing also a few drops of muriatic acid,--it will be red; dye another piece green by immersing it in a mixture of tincture of turmeric and litmus; and another purple, by a mixture of infusion of galls and sulphate of iron. Let them dry; then immerse them altogether in a solution of sub-carbonate of potas. The white will be changed to a yellow; the yellow to a red; the red to green; the green to purple; and the purple to black; and it is not improbable that black might be materially changed or bleached by the same simple solution.

<BR>
What is true and rational religion? In answering this important question, we shall come to the point at once, without prejudice or sectarian influence; and laying aside all traditionary superstition, which has had its origin in clerical policy, inquire what is now the will of the blessed Diety, with regard to the conduct of the children of men. What course of conduct, in us, frail, erring human creatures, will now, under all the present existing circumstances, be acceptable and approved by our divine Creator, who continually watches over us, and observes our every act, and the thoughts of our hearts? We have so dilligently examined the answer which we are about to give to these questions, and so attentively viewed the subject in all its bearings, and with all its evidences and demonstrations, that we can not think it possible that there is any ground to doubt its correctness. First, then, let us, as rational creatures, be ever ready to acknowledge God as our Creator and daily Preserver; and that we are each of us individually dependant on his special care and good will towards us, in supporting the wonderful action of nature which constitutes our existence; and in preserving us from the casualties, to which our complicated and delicate structure is liable. Let us also, knowing our entire dependence on Divine Benevolence, as rational creatures, do ourselves the honor to express personally and frequently, our thanks to him for his goodness; and to present our petitions to Him for the favours which we constantly require. This course is rational, even without the aid of revelation: but being specially invited to this course, by the divine word, and assured of the readiness of our Creator to answer our prayers and recognize our thanks, it is truly surprising that any rational being, who has ever read the inspired writings should willingly forego this privilege, or should be ashamed to be seen engaged in this rational employment, or to have it known that he practices it. Next to the worship of God by thanksgiving and prayer, we skould repel and banish all feelings of anger and bitterness toward our fellow beings, and cherish love and kind feelings towards them. This course is also rational, having the example of God in his kind dealings towards us; and conduces at once, to the glory of God, the happiness of mankind in general, and to our own individual happiness and prosperity in particular. It is also a rational duty to be ever reconciled and resigned to the dispensations of Divine Providence; and to trust in the goodness and benevolence of God for the present and future, and to feel willing to have it known amongst our associates, that we follow a rational course. This is rational religion.

<I>The following item is the more interesting on account of a recent statement by one of the missionaries, that the Chinese are supposed to spend $360,000,000 annually for incense to burn before their idols:</I>
<BR>
Dr. Parker Of The China Mission, in a letter recently received, says, that a report came to his ears that a native Chinese had memorialized the Emperor in relation to Christianity, forwarding at the same time specimens of Tracts, &c., and that the Emperor had returned an answer in which he said that the publication of such Tracts was calculated to promote virtue and happiness, and ought to be encouraged. Dr. Parker wrote to the governor to ascertain whether this was indeed the fact. The governor in a very curious reply, confirms the report, and added that the Emperor had concluded to excuse those who embraced the Christian religion, and believed in such Tracts, from the punishment usually inflicted.

<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Second Adventism</B></FONT>
<BR>
A gentleman writing from England, states that a religious excitement similar to American Millerism, has commenced in that country, under the auspices of late ministers of the established church, who preach the approaching second advent of the Saviour; but that the preachers have all been suspended by the established church. It could not be expected, that the dignitaries of that church would tolerate the preaching of the probability of an event, by them dreaded as one that would destroy all their fair prospects with their enormous salaries, and honours of this world.

<A NAME="rare"><FONT SIZE="+1"><I>Most numerous</A> are the inventions lost to the world for ages, and many doubtless to this day, be inventors, being poor, could not bring them out. To remedy this evil to some extent, the following plan is suggested.</I></FONT>
<BR><B>RARE PROJECT</B>
<BR>G PECK & CO. having, and being offered, several new inventions, worthy to be tested and brought out, present to the public the following liberal offers.
<BR>
One invention promises great usefulness to most cities, villages, and farmers; one, great aid to agriculture. One, greater safety and cheapness to rail-road conveyance; one a great saving of expense, time and toil in education, &c.
<BR>
They require means to bring them into use. If many will furnish each a little the burden will be light--the success almost certain, and the advantage the greater; and this advantage the inventors will gladly share with the helpers. Incurring much expense, and risking much themselves, it cannot be presuming too much to trust that an intelligent public will see it to be liberal, and wise to risk a little and invest the small sum proposed on the terms here offered.
<BR>
It is little any can lose if he were to get no return, while we must lose far more, even for advertising, if none accept our offers. But they will have some return, and may much gain. Let then each send us his name and $2, or 25 cents weekly for ten weeks, and secure the advantages of these inventions.
<BR>
We add one other consideration. Had Fitch, who first applied steam to propel a boat, and was the real first inventor of steam boats, received a little aid, steam boats would have been in operation more than 50 years ago, and our country would have had the undisputed honor of the invention. But he exhausted his means--none would help--and though he knew it was worth millions, he died in poverty, and our country was the loser for a half century.
<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>WORTHY ATTENTION</I>
<BR>
A share or town right of a valuable patent--50 or 100 acres of good farming land: $2, $30, or $85 cash; a copy of the circular interest tables, or a useful Essay, to be had on easy terms.
<BR>
The patent share will be sent to any one who sends us $2, or 25 cents weekly for ten weeks, which share will be worth $5 or more.
<BR>
The town right will be his who procures 25 share subscribers and sends us the money. The 50 acres his who sends us the money for 150 subscribers within three months. The 100 acres his who sends us for 300 in four months. The $2 his who sends us the $2 each for 12 subscribers in 2 months. $30 his who sends for 100 in 3 months, $85 his who sends for 250 in 6 months. The interest tables or Essay shall be his who sends us immediately the names of each waggon, carriage, plough or harness maker, of each farmer who keeps bees or silk worms, of owners of furnaces or forges, of each physician, minister, teacher, miller, tanner and merchant of the village or town where he lives, twenty-five names or more; and also a share of the patent right if he sends 25 or more names and 25 cents cash within one month.
<BR>
The patent share to each of those who pay $2 within 8 weeks from next September 1, or before, will embrace three inventions; to those who pay in the next 5 weeks, two inventions; and but one to others, and not this unless cash is received within 4 months, unless we choose. The essay or tables will also be his who pays before September 20th. What we desire is speedy work--hence these large premiums. Most important important inventions will thus be secured, and a profitable share to each.
<BR>
We also offer to any one who will send us $10, $30, $75 or $125, to give him 3, 9, 27 or 54 shares one-third in each of three inventions, or a town right of one, two or three of the patents, and a privilege to sell rights, at great profit; and he may commence at once. We can give good business of this kind now. If our project meets with the favor we expect we shall be able to give a great deal of business of this kind, and thus greatly promote enterprize and industry. We have the best machine to clean wheat of smut, garlic, &c.; price $75. Over 70 have been put in operation in one county in Pennsylvania. We have also the best cultivator for tilling corn and putting in wheat and rye, from $6 to $15. Also the neatest, handiest and swiftest straw cutter of its size, for $12. Office for orders at room 13, 25 Pine street, next to the Custom House.
<BR>
The inventions will be of different values, and will be put into such number of shares as will make each share worth $5 or more. We will dispose of the rights, keep the accounts, and pay to share holders the dividends. We shall also from time to time, quarterly or oftener, send them a paper giving them a full account of the inventions, as far as it will be best to publish it. We shall send them the first in September. Let it announce that subscribers are already in to secure the whole project. It will not fail if no more subscribe than we already have. We can do a little, and each who helps will aid us to do more; thus none will lose, but if many help, the better it will be to each. One of the most promising inventions will be very costly to start. We want 10,000 subscribers for it: but it will be worth ten times the cost; and it is certain of success, it has been so far tested. The others are very excellent in promise.
<BR>
The inventions are very important; the land good in this State or in Pennsylvania; the Tables useful, and the Essay on a subject of deep interest to all; and the periodical we shall we shall occasionally send, free of charge, will be of general interest to farmers, mechanics, patentees, physicians, ministers, and owners of minerals, and to all.
<BR>
It is thus the interest of all to push this project. Let then each improve this offer at once, and have the satisfaction of aiding to bring out great inventions that promise vast benefit to mankind, and good profit to the helpers, as well as timely aid to some worthy inventors, who are struggling with poverty, whom we greatly desire to aid. Now is the word! Now or never. If QUICKLY done, it will be DONE and WELL done, and a GOOD THING done.
<BR>
It will be easy for two or more to unite, write their names in a letter, put in the money, and direct to G. Peck & Co., New York. The mail will bring it safe, or we will risk it, and pay the postage.
<BR>
<I>New York, August, 1845. G.PECK & CO.</I>
<BR>
Editors who will notice this rare project and advertise it, will promote a great public good, and shall share liberally in the advantage they promote. For 13 insertions of the project in full, they shall receive 5 of the three right shares.
<BR>
Besides the guarantee, which the expense we have already incurred for patents, models, machines, advertising, &c. to make these proposals, gives, to warrant confidence at least to the little extent we ask, we are favored with the following certificate, signed by Hon. R. H. Morris, late mayor and present post-master, and by Hon. F. A. Tallmadge, the present recorder of New York:--
<BR>
"Messrs. G. Peck & Co. wishing the public to favor their business, this certifies, that, from our personal acquaintance we are assured that confidence in their proposals will not be misplaced.

N. B.--We have one invention, well tested, worth $100,000, the profits of which from this state or Massachusetts will be three times that sum in the next five years. It needs a capital of $25,000. A half can be had for this sum, one half as capital, and an equal sum to be paid out of the half of the first avails.
<BR>
All our travelling and city agents will have receipts to give, signed by us. Postmasters, Editors, and others, acting as local agents, in towns and villages where they are known, will give their own receipts, which will be duly acknowledged by G. Peck & Co.

<BR>
RETAIL PRICE $200 BOUND IN MUSLIN, GILT.
<BR>
THE TITLE OF THE WORK IS AS FOLLOWS:--
<BR>
THE PICTORIAL HISTORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION;
<BR>
WITH AN ACCOUNT OF THE EARLY HISTORY OF THE COUNTRY; THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES, AND A CHRONOLOGICAL INDEX;ILLUSTRATED WITH SEVERAL HUNDRED ENGRAVINGS!
<BR>
It is the determination of the publisher to spare neither pains nor expense to make this work perfectly accessible to every family throughout the entire country. It is one of the most attractive and cheapest ever presented to the patronage of the American people. The preparation of the work has been attended with great labor and expense. HISTORY requires a distant eminence, from which to take an impartial view of the character of the transactions which submit themselves to the recording pen: but more than half a century has now elapsed since the colonists first asserted their independence; and the generation, whose arduous struggles achieved so glorious a result, has passed away to the silent tomb.
<BR>
Through the whole work, the editor has aimed to do justice without asperity; to applaud patriotism, but not to justify its excesses; to condemn tyranny, but not to overlook the virtues of many of its instruments; and to exhibit the kindly prospect of the FUTURE more strongly than the irritating aspect of the PAST. The great interest that the bare mention of such a work is calculated to excite, has encouraged the editor to make it every way worthy of a liberal patronage. An extensive sale can only enable the publisher to offer it at the low price proposed. Postmasters and others wishing to act as Agents, will receive all necessary information by addressing, post-paid.

A. G. BAGLEY'S CELEBRATED IMPROVED EVER-POINTED GOLD PEN.
<BR>
THIS Pen received the highest premium at the last Fair of the American Institute, and has been pronounced by the first teachers of Penmanship in the country to be infinitely superior to any Gold Pen ever before introduced to the American public. The lasting properties of this Pen are undoubted, owing to the total abisence of corrosibility from any of the inks in use, and the peculiar shape of the nibs, [which was first introduced by Bagley] makes it more pleasant to use, renders it less liable to damage, more easy to repair, and prevents the necessity of the great care that other articles of the kind require.

<H3>Online traffic jams spur cries <BR>of 
doom--and plans for Internet II</H3></CENTER>

<P>The Internet, warn some <I>eminences grises</I>, is staggering
chaotically toward massive <A
HREF="http://www.infoworld.com/cgi-bin/displayStory.pl?
961011.stanford.htm">outages</A>, perhaps even a total <A
HREF="http://
www.infoworld.com/cgi-bin/displayNew.pl?/metcalfe/bm070896.htm">collapse</A>.
Nonsense, retort others: the future has never looked brighter for
the global network. Both sides are correct. True, the <A
HREF="http://www.mit.edu/people/mkgray/net/">explosive growth of the
World Wide Web</A> is pushing Internet standards and switches near their
breaking points, while floods of information regularly back up the
network plumbing.

<P>But for more than a decade, congestion has hung over the Net like
the sword over Damocles, poised to sever its connections. Last-minute
additions of more and bigger pipes have always averted crisis. This
time, however, the problems run deeper, and although technical
solutions are in hand, they will exact a price--and not just in the
figurative sense. The resulting economic tremors may well topple some
of the Web's shakier business plans, but they should also reshape the
Internet into a more efficient and reliable medium.

<P>The source of doomsayers' angst is the Net's <A
HREF="http://raptor.isc.rit.edu/Welcome/GetConn/guide.61/guide.05.html">geometric growth</A>:
by most measurements, it doubles in size every nine months or so. Such
rapid expansion creates three major threats to the system. The first
jeopardizes its ability to connect any two computers on the network.
The Internet does so in much the same way as an automated postal
system: computers wrap data into packages, stamp the packets with
addresses and hand them to automated postal clerks (called routers) to
deliver.

<P>But the Internet's numerical address system has nothing to do with
location. The Net equivalent of 10 Main St. may be in Maine, whereas
11 Main St. is in Ohio. So each automated clerk has to look up
delivery instructions in a table for every packet it handles. Because
packets often pass through 10 or more routers before reaching their
destination, the time spent poring over large tables can jam up
traffic considerably. More alarming, <A
HREF="http://compute.merit.edu/analysis/routing.html">routers' tables are
growing</A> twice as fast as their ability to search them. Within two
years, that could leave the Net's postmasters with just two unpleasant
options: either toss some packets into the trash or refuse to add new
addresses (especially those for competing network companies) to their
tables.

<P>Two recent innovations will postpone that Faustian choice. The
first was a stopgap measure: the <A
HREF="http://www.internic.net/">agency that hands out Net addresses</A>
has been pressuring network managers to organize addresses into
sensible groups--much like zip codes. That strategy bought enough time
to start using the second improvement, a scheme called <A
HREF="http://www.infoworld.com/cgi-bin/displayNew.pl?/metcalfe/bm100796.
htm">tag switching</A>, which was introduced in September by <A HREF="
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/732/tag/pjtag_wp.html">Cisco</A>, the
company that built most of the routers on the Internet. Here the first
clerk to examine a package writes down explicit instructions for all
the other clerks that will handle it, saving them the time and trouble
of consulting their tables.

<P>The second threat to the Net is that it may 
<A HREF="http://www.infoworld.com/cgi-bin/displayNew.pl?/metcalfe/bm090996.htm">run out of
numerical addresses</A> altogether, bringing its geometric growth to a
crashing halt. Although the current addressing format theoretically
supports about 4.3 billion computers, large swaths of the numbers have
been given away but never used. By recycling old addresses and dipping
into reserves, the existing supply can probably be stretched into the
next decade--long enough to switch to new software, playfully named <A
HREF="
http://playground.sun.com/pub/ipng/html/ipng-main.html">"Internet
Protocol, the Next Generation."</A> IPng will allow every human on the
planet to have something like 100 network devices. That should suffice
for a while.

<P>The final danger to the stability of the burgeoning Internet is
that congestion will <A
HREF="http://www.infoworld.com/cgi-bin/displayNew.pl?/metcalfe/bm093096.htm">slow data to a crawl</A>, ruining plans for
fancy interactive games, cheap long-distance calls and grainy video on
demand. Because bottlenecks often occur at the switches deep inside
the Internet cloud rather than at the periphery where workers and
consumers connect, the problem will only grow worse as more people buy
PCs and fast modems. Slick routing tricks such as tag switching will
help for a time. And many of the companies who own parts of the
Internet's <A HREF="http://www.uu.net/intlmap/namerica.html">backbone</A> are scrambling to expand it;
<A HREF="http://www.mci.com/">MCI</A> tripled the capacity of its
segment this past summer. But demand will outstrip supply as long as
Internet access remains so inexpensive; MCI has also seen the flow
over its network swell 56-fold in less than two years.

<P>As Microsoft Network, <A
HREF="http://www.aol.com/">America Online</A> and <A
HREF="http://www.prodigy.com/"> Prodigy</A> get ready to join
companies offering unbeatable, all-you-can-surf pricing, some schools
and corporations with high hopes for the Internet are preparing to <A
HREF="http://www.infoworld.com/cgi-bin/displayNew.pl?/metcalfe/bm102196.htm">jump ship</A>. In October a
group of universities announced plans to build Internet II, a
high-speed national network linking perhaps 50 research institutions.

<P>The private network would connect to the Internet at "GigaPOPs"
scattered throughout the country. (A POP, or point of presence, is the
Internet equivalent of a post office.) But it would close its gates to
outside users in order to preserve enough bandwidth to work on
high-tech projects--such as telemedicine, distance learning,
scientific visualization and broadcast video of undergrads' dorm
parties--without the hassle of Internet congestion. Companies such as
<A HREF="http://www2.chryslercorp.com/">Chrysler</A> are rumored to be
toying with similar options to link factories with dealers and
material suppliers. (Private "intranets" exist, but they generally
link their far-flung locations using the Internet and are thus at the
mercy of Net-wide congestion.)

<P>Internet II will not ease the pressure on Internet I directly by
more than a few percent, but it may have a lasting indirect influence.
University officials involved say they want to try out new pricing
policies and special delivery software designed to help guarantee
rapid responses and clear channels to those willing to pay for them.

<P>These good ideas have been around for years. One, called resource
reservation protocol, or <A
HREF="http://www.isi.edu/div7/rsvp/rsvp.html" >RSVP</A>, is even
scheduled to appear this fall in Cisco routers and <A
HREF="http://www.intel.com/comm-net/proshare/">Intel videoconferencing
software</A>. The hang-up has been billing: if the urgent data are
delivered partly by MCI, partly by <A
HREF="http://www.sprint.com/">Sprint</A> and partly by <A
HREF="http://www.pacbell.com/products/business/fastrak/networking/nap/features.html">Pacific Bell</A>, all three need to
agree on systems to split the fees. Internet II, because it would have
just one backbone and one bill to pay, could test whether RSVP and
other priority schemes work at large scales, while punting on the
billing issue.

<P>In the meantime, some networking companies, chafing at the thin
margins of their commodity business, will soon start offering
higher-quality Internet access for higher prices. No one knows how the
market will react when, inevitably, basic services slow as premium
customers are ushered to the head of the queue. If, as some insiders
predict, the companies that run the Internet's backbone soon begin
charging those on its limbs according to the amount of data they send
or receive, they will have little choice but to pass the costs along.
Forced to decide what is worth paying for, many customers will first
tune out images--thus destroying the fledging Internet advertising
business--and will then search more, browse less. Although this may
rob the Net of much of its charm, it would almost certainly prod it
toward greater utility.

The medical technique of arthroscopy produces a clear image of tissue located
inside skeletal joints. The arthroscope, derived from Greek roots meaning "to
look at joints," allows a surgeon to see within a damaged knee, shoulder or other
joint so that repairs can be made with miniature surgical tools. Its advantages
include reduced discomfort for the patient, a shorter postoperative recovery and
often a better surgical outcome. <P> A Japanese physician, Kenji Takagi,
pioneered the technique in the early 1930s, but it remained a curiosity until one
of Takagi's students, Masaki Watanabe, developed the first modern arthroscope
more than 35 years ago. Although crude by current standards, it still produced a
good image of knee joints. Orthopedists began to take up the procedure widely in
the 1970s, when optical fibers made the use of scopes more practical. Today
surgeons perform more than 1.5 million arthroscopies every year in the U.S.--and
the technique has transformed the discipline of sports medicine. <P> The
procedure begins when a surgeon makes a six-millimeter incision in the knee or
other joint. The joint is inflated with a saline solution to provide a working
space for the instruments. The surgeon then introduces the arthroscope, a
four-millimeter-diameter telescope attached to a miniature color camera. Light
channeled through optical fibers in the scope illuminates damaged cartilage.
Lenses create an image that is relayed by a camera to a television screen that
the orthopedist observes while the operation is in progress. Miniaturized cutting
and grasping tools are inserted through other similarly small incisions. <P> A
motorized cutting device, for example, might remove torn cartilage in the knee
during a procedure known as a meniscectomy. Before the advent of arthroscopic
surgery, a meniscectomy involved a many-centimeter-long incision along the side
of the knee, with a recovery period that could last months. An arthroscopic
operation requires a recovery period of only a few days. The technique has given
meaning to the notion of minimally invasive surgery. <P>

NEUROBIOLOGY

<center><H2>SUICIDE PREVENTION</H2>

<B>Biochemistry offers some new clues</B>
</center>

<P>A number of known factors can,  under certain circumstances,     compel
someone to attempt suicide. Mental illness, family history and life events often
contribute significantly.  Mere opportunity, too, increases the risk: for every
firearm death attributed to self-protection, there are some 37 suicides. Even so,
individual suicides are exceedingly difficult to predict. Indeed, a recent survey
showed that although roughly half of all suicide victims visit clinicians during
the 90 days preceding their death, only a quarter receive any psychiatric
treatment.

<P>To remedy that situation--and prevent tens of thousands of deaths each
year--neuroscientists are now actively searching for the biological triggers
behind suicidal behavior. So far their findings point to mixed-up chemical
messengers in the prefrontal cortex, an area of the brain involved in processing
emotions and inhibitions. "New research indicates that suicide is not a normal
response to severe distress," says <A HREF="http://www.primepsych.com/Suicide5.html">J. John Mann</A> of Columbia University and the
New York State Psychiatric Institute, "but [is] the response of a person with a
vulnerability to act on powerful feelings."

<P>Mann has focused his studies on the neurotransmitter serotonin. Scientists
have long known that monkeys with depleted serotonin metabolites in their spinal
fluid tend to be more impulsive and aggressive. In 1976 it was first demonstrated
that depressed suicide attempters had similarly low levels. More recently, Mann
and his colleague Kevin M. Malone reported that these levels are in fact lowest
in people who make the most lethal attempts to end their life. From these facts,
the researchers guess that serotonin signaling in the brains of suicidal
individuals is inadequate.

<P>Testing that idea is somewhat difficult. "The technology for looking at
serotonin activity directly in the living brain is still under development," Mann
says. He has, however, devised an approximation technique: he made positron
emission tomographic (PET) scans of patients shortly after they took the
serotonin-releasing compound fenfluramine. In healthy adults the drug increased
metabolic activity in the prefrontal cortex. But as expected, this change was
minimal in depressed patients.

<P>Mann's colleague Victoria Arango has found additional evidence linking
diminished serotonin activity to suicide. It is impossible to measure serotonin
levels directly after death because the compound quickly dissipates. So Arango
prepared slides of prefrontal cortex--taken from depressed and alcoholic suicide
victims--and counted the number of serotonin receptors. Most samples, compared
with control subjects, contained more receptors. This was no great surprise. Such
a change could represent the body's own efforts to compensate for naturally weak
serotonin signals; the more antennae each neuron puts forth, the better its
chances for clear communications.

<P>"In alcoholics, however, we found some unexpected results," Arango says. These
samples revealed a dearth of serotonin receptors. The shortage may be genetic or
developmental and so help predispose someone to alcoholism. Or it may just be yet
another of alcohol's many toxic effects, Arango suggests. Whatever the cause,
alcoholics, it appears, lack the ability to compensate for weak serotonin
signals--a fact that could help explain why suicide rates in this group are
astonishingly high. Some 18 percent of alcoholics take their own life, compared
with 15 percent of depressed or manic-depressive people and 10 percent of
schizophrenics.

<P>Other biochemical abnormalities appear in suicide victims as well. Mary
Pacheco of the University of Alabama at Birmingham has developed an assay for
studying secondary-messenger systems in postmortem tissues. These systems relay
information from a cell's surface to its nucleus, where an appropriate response
is generated. "If this communication system does not work well, behavioral
responses to the environment, such as emotion and learning, may be affected,"
Pacheco states.

<P>She found that in depressed suicide victims, one such system, the
phosphoinositide system, was impaired by some 30 percent. Further investigation
showed that the problem lay in a class of proteins, called G-proteins, that are
activated by cell receptors and that are capable of rousing the phosphoinositide
system. "If we can find out why the G-protein does not work correctly, it might
enable us to develop better therapeutic agents for treating depression," Pacheco
adds. Certainly, many people hope she is right.

FIELD NOTES

<center><h2>Amphibians On-line</h2></center><P>

It's no secret why conferences are typically held in places like New Orleans or
Sun Valley. In between the long talks, people want to wander around the French
Quarter or take a few runs down the slope. So, of course, I'm curious to check
out the "Field Trips" listing in the guide to the third annual meeting of the
North American Amphibian Monitoring Project (NAAMP). I'm a bit shocked to see
"Exotic Dancers" as an option, but I take a peek anyway. Dancing frogs? Where am
I?

<P>This winter the <A HREF=" http://www.im.nbs.gov/naamp3/naamp3.html">NAAMP
conference was held in cyberspace</A>. Meetings began in November 1996 and ended
in mid-February 1997. In addition to the unusual field trips (another favorite: a
virtual voyage to <A HREF="http://www.calacademy.
org/research/herpetology/frogs/ list.html">see and hear the frogs of Kenya's
Arabuko-Sokoke Forest</A>), the conference offered some 50 papers on topics that
included aquatic sampling techniques and frog-calling surveys.

<P>Sam Droege of the U.S. Geological Service Biological Resources Division headed
the on-line conference--seemingly the first one of this size to have been held on
the World Wide Web. Droege is pleased with the response. "We have reached a much
wider audience than [we did in] our previous meetings," he writes by e-mail.
"Folks can attend when they like, can look closely at the data and statements
made, can respond publicly (or privately) to the author if they disagree or want
further details." Papers from the meeting will be archived on the Web site, but
the discussion groups will become inactive after February 14.

<P>Despite the various humorous diversions, much of the business conducted was
quite serious: several reports presented findings of exceptionally high numbers
of malformed amphibians. David M. Hoppe of the University of Minnesota at Morris
points to what he calls a "recent, rapid-onset phenomenon" of limb
deformities--which include missing or extra legs and digits. In his paper
"Historical Observations and Recent Species Diversity of Deformed Anurans in
Minnesota," Hoppe notes that in the course of handling thousands of frogs between
1975 and 1995, he saw only two with visible limb defects; in 1996 alone he saw
more than 200. Hoppe speculates that an environmental agent in the water where
the creatures breed could be the cause.

<P>Stanley K. Sessions of Hartwick College has also encountered an unusually high
frequency of amphibian limb abnormalities, in particular, among Pacific tree
frogs and long-toed salamanders in northern California. In his NAAMP paper,
Sessions argues that parasitic flatworms known as trematodes triggered the limb
defects. He also comments that the infestation by trematodes could be linked to
human-caused environmental problems.

<P>Just as reporters do at any conference, I interview some of the participants.
Sessions e-mails me from Costa Rica, where he is currently doing fieldwork. He
has mixed feelings about the cyberconference--although he is pleased with how
easy and inexpensive it was to participate, he has been disappointed by a lack of
interaction with other scientists during the meeting. "A cyberconference such as
this one is no substitute for a conventional conference, because the important
face-to-face social interactions are not happening," he writes. So, alas, the
next NAAMP conference will be more conventional, without any dancing frogs.

NUCLEAR WASTE

<center><H2>NOT IN MY BACKYARD</H2>

<B>Could ocean mud trap nuclear<BR> waste from old Russian subs?</B>
</center>

<P>Disclosures by Russia that it had dumped 16 nuclear reactors from ships and
submarines into the Arctic's Kara Sea shocked Western sensibilities a few years
ago. And although it never purposefully plunged nuclear reactors into the
Pacific, the Soviet navy had routinely disposed of radioactive liquids in those
waters. Interestingly, researchers have detected little pollution from these
former practices, showing the ocean's resiliency and, perhaps, unique capacity
for absorbing radioactive wastes.

<P>Not only do ocean waters dilute such contaminants, but the fine-grained
sediments that accumulate on the bottom of the sea can hold fast to certain
radioactive elements, effectively isolating them. That phenomenon has, for
example, helped to lessen the environmental injury caused by a B-52 bomber that
crashed onto floating ice off Greenland in 1968, dispersing plutonium into
shallow coastal waters. Scott W. Fowler and his colleagues at the International
Atomic Energy Agency in Monte Carlo summarized the results of years of careful
assessment of that accident in a 1994 report: "These studies demonstrated that
plutonium...was rapidly bound by the sediments, thus becoming effectively
retained in the benthic ecosystem. They noted that "no significant increases in
plutonium concentrations were found in either the overlying waters, zooplankton,
pelagic fish, sea birds, marine mammals, or the indigenous population."

<P>Thus, it would seem that more careful ocean disposal, if conducted safely,
might help ease Russia's radioactive burden. In addition to the many problems
threatening Arctic sites, the Pacific naval bases near Vladivostok and on the
Kamchatka Peninsula hold radioactive waste in the form of some 50 decommissioned
submarines. Since 1993 (the year they first gave a candid account of their
dumping activities), the Russians have ceased injecting low-level liquid waste
into the Pacific. But with the continuing economic crisis, work on
decommissioning submarines and disposing of their wastes proceeds excruciatingly
slowly. Less than half the nuclear submarines retired from service in the Soviet
Pacific fleet have had their nuclear fuel removed. Fewer still have had their
reactor compartments cut out so that the remaining metal can be used for scrap.
Most vessels float tied up in port, patiently awaiting dismantling.

<P>According to Bruce F. Molnia, chief of environmental activities at the U.S.
Geological Survey, the only promise of progress in the area comes from a joint
Russian-Japanese effort to build a holding barge equipped to concentrate the
copious low-level radioactive liquids generated by these submarines. That
maneuver should lessen the volume that needs to be stored, but it does not
address the fundamental question of what ultimately to do with the resulting
radioactive brine. The future disposition of spent fuel and reactor cores is also
of great concern, as is the permanent storage of reactor compartments.

<P>Although speedy reprocessing might help alleviate the immediate problems near
Vladivostok (reprocessing is done far to the west), it would only create a
different set of headaches elsewhere, including toxic solutions full of
radioactive fission products. One wonders how these liquids would be disposed of.

<P>British and French reprocessing plants resorted to releasing their radioactive
effluent into coastal waters, and a recognizable plume containing those
contaminants now stretches into the North Atlantic. In fact, measurements in the
Kara Sea show the effects of nuclear fuel reprocessing in western Europe (and of
atmospheric weapons testing). But, curiously, they do not indicate any regional
pollution caused by Russia's nuclear dumping there.

<P>If muddy sediments have indeed helped trap radioactive materials from the
reactors discarded in these shallow waters, the notion of using deeper parts of
the seabed for <A HREF="http://www.theatlantic.com/atlantic/issues/96oct/seabed/seabed.htm">long-term disposal of nuclear wastes</A> would seem that much more
reasonable. That concept, which calls for encapsulating nuclear wastes and
burying them in deep-sea muds, was effectively dropped from worldwide
consideration when the U.S. decided to bury its waste on land, naming Yucca
Mountain in Nevada as the site for a future nuclear waste repository. But the
idea is still alive in the minds of some scientists. Charles D. Hollister of the
Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution has been especially vocal in his support for
continued study of this option.

<P>One way to evaluate how deep-sea muds sequester radioactive wastes, Hollister
contends, is to investigate the effects of certain maritime disasters. At a
recent meeting of the American Geophysical Union, he suggested that the
accidental sinking of a Soviet ballistic missile submarine in 1986 offers "a very
exciting experimental opportunity." After suffering an explosion at sea, that
vessel plummeted to the bottom of the deep Atlantic carrying two reactors and 34
nuclear warheads with it. Exploring the wreckage site could determine if mud can
indeed trap radioactive substances.

<P>Hollister is not currently advocating the disposal of nuclear waste in the
ocean. "It should be illegal to do it until we've studied it," he stated flatly
to his audience. But it is clear that he believes parts of the seabed could well
serve as nuclear repositories. "It isn't a warm, fuzzy feeling you get about it,"
he quipped as he expressed his long-held view that burying unwanted nuclear
materials in deep-sea muds "is probably the safest thing we can do with them."
But with defunct subs and their radioactive wastes continuing to pile up close to

EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY

<center><H2>WHERE DO TURTLES GO?</H2>

<B>Turtles may not be the "living<BR> fossils" they were thought to be</B>
</center>

<P>The first time that paleontologist Olivier Rieppel presented his findings on
turtles, before 200 people at a meeting last year sponsored by the Society of
Vertebrate Paleontology, a presenter prefaced his talk with, "And now everybody
may hiss as much as you like." Venomous commentary did not ensue, but a bit of a
murmur must have lingered as Rieppel announced that he believed turtles had been
classified in the wrong branch of the reptile family tree. <P>Rieppel, from the
Field Museum in Chicago, and Ph.D. student Michael deBraga of Erindale College in
Ontario, knew they were proposing a maverick theory. Turtles had long been deemed
to be "living fossils," the only surviving member of a primitive reptile
subclass, the anapsids, which originated some 325 million years ago in the
Paleozoic era. Now these two researchers were proposing that turtles belonged to
the modern reptilian lot--the diapsids, which first emerged about 230 million
years ago in the Triassic and include present-day lizards, snakes and crocodiles.

<P>The team came to that conclusion using cladistics, a generally well accepted
way of figuring evolutionary relations. It relies on the muddy task of
identifying so-called homologous characteristics shared by certain groups. But
they decided to challenge the long-held belief that anapsid and diapsid skulls
are the ultimate defining characteristics. So unlike earlier cladistic modeling
of turtles, Rieppel and deBraga examined numerous features and included taxa from
outside the Paleozoic. DeBraga says, "We decided to look at everything...[to give
turtles] a whole new approach, and lo and behold look at what happens."

<P>Their work hinged on computer analyses of huge sets of data. Although more
data would seem to buttress the validity of their work, it intensified the
predicament of deciding which characteristics are appropriate. Among the 168
characteristics studied, what really convinced Rieppel that turtles are diapsids
were their ankles. He says the morphological similarity among the ankles of
turtles, lizards and the tuatara, a lizard from New Zealand, is too strong to be
denied.

<P>Although some of the morphological evidence presented is quite sound, Rieppel
and deBraga hear some hissing. Gene Gaffney, curator of vertebrate paleontology
at the American Museum of Natural History (and orator of the snide opening
statement before Rieppel's talk), believes the "evidence presented was somewhat
skewed." He notes that some of the characteristics used in the study--bone
ossification, for one--are not particularly reliable for all amniotes (reptiles,
birds, mammals). Other critics assert that comparing different groups can spawn
erroneous, or at least highly questionable, theories. Such was the case in the
1800s, when the theory of hematothermia arose. It stated that birds and mammals
are closely related because they are both warm-blooded, even though the
overwhelming evidence suggests that birds are more reptilian.

<P>What particularly distresses some researchers about the turtle debate is that
it takes only a few additional characteristics in the data matrix to move turtles
again, back into anapsids. Rieppel counters by insisting that evolutionary trees
tend to become unstable when they become too heavy with characteristics.

<P>Although their work may not have received the sanctification of colleagues,
neither has it been discounted. Other animals may be misplaced and thus may force
a reworking, or at least a rethinking, of various evolutionary paths. Never mind
the hissing, at least they're talking.

<P>As Julius Caesar might have put it, all of the galling things that can happen
to the human body can be divided into three parts. There are the ordinary
adversities, when the body falls victim to common disease or accident. Then there
are the vapid calamities, such as when the body hoists a few and decides to take
a midnight stroll along some train tracks, in which case the body itself may be
divided into three parts. Finally, there exist those rare misadventures that
would have forced Hamlet to up his estimate to 1,001 for the number of shocks the
body's flesh is heir to. The story of the young man and the balloons belongs in
this last category.

<P>"A 24-year-old previously healthy, nonsmoker presented with a 48-hour history
of a sensation of crackling under the skin," wrote attending physician Stuart
Elborn, then at the University Hospital of Wales, in a recent issue of the
<I>British Medical Journal.</I> His examination turned up pockets of air trapped
under the skin on the man's shoulders, chest, neck, abdomen, back, arms, legs
and, providing a built-in whoopie-cushion effect, derriere.

<P>Because people seldom spontaneously change into flotation devices, Elborn
asked the man if he had done anything unusual. He learned that two days earlier
his buoyant patient had inflated some 20 balloons in about an hour. "We were
pretty sure what was going on when we heard that," Elborn says. "To develop
subcutaneous air collections, you need to have a leak from your lung for some
reason." And that reason was the Valsalva.

<P>Valsalva is not where Scandinavian heroes go when they die. It is, in fact, a
medical maneuver in which a subject takes in a deep breath, then tries to exhale
forcefully without first opening the glottis. An interesting thing about the
Valsalva is that it is quite commonly performed. Blowing up balloons happens to
be an excellent way to do it. And careless Valsalving can burst some of the
lung's alveoli, the tiny air sacs where gas exchange actually occurs. "It seems
that most seem to stop after four or five," Elborn says, "whereas he blew up 20.
He probably started leaking air maybe after three or four and then by continuing
to inflate balloons managed to push out a large volume of air into the skin."

<P>Other activities can cause this inflated sense of self. Air trapped under the
skin is well documented among saxophone players, whose aggressive style probably
makes them more susceptible than other wind musicians, according to Elborn.
Marijuana smokers attempting to hold in the fumes unwittingly do the Valsalva.
Those at greatest risk for the kind of bloat the balloon blower experienced would
thus be pot-smoking sax players. (Meanwhile President Bill Clinton has backed
members of Congress who are attempting to protect the people of Arizona and
California, the electorate in both states having approved legalization of
marijuana for medical purposes. These citizens almost certainly voted in complete
ignorance of the potential danger of turning into life rafts.)

<P>Back in Wales, 10 days after visiting the hospital, the intrepid balloonist
had completely deflated, the trapped air having diffused into capillaries with no
lasting ill effects. His experience, however, is a warning for us all. "Clearly,
if you have any pain or discomfort when you're blowing up a balloon," counsels
Elborn, who has since moved to the Belfast City Hospital, "you should stop. It
might be better to use a pump."

LINGUISTICS

<center><H2>A MATTER<BR> OF LANGUAGE</H2>

<B>The popular debate over Ebonics<BR>
belies decades of linguistic research</B>
</center>

<P>On December 18 the board of education in Oakland, Calif., unanimously adopted
a policy stating that most of the 26,000 black students in its district do not
speak English as their primary language but rather speak "West and Niger-Congo
African Language Systems," which the directive also calls "Ebonics." "Numerous
validated scholarly studies," the policy asserts, have demonstrated that "African
Language Systems are genetically based and not a dialect of English." (In January
the board deleted the phrase "genetically based" from its policy.)

<P>The policy does not order schools to teach Ebonics--until recently, a rarely
used term for the variety of English spoken by many urban blacks in the U.S.
Linguists more commonly refer to the variety as black English vernacular (BEV).
Oakland's policy does insist, however, that teachers should understand BEV and
use it to help black students learn educated English.

<P>Oakland's decision, and the firestorm of controversy it generated in the
media, left many linguists pleased that the issue was being discussed yet
dismayed that so much of the debate seemed to ignore linguistic research. "Black
English is clearly the most heavily investigated variety of English over the past
30 years," notes Walt Wolfram, a linguist at North Carolina State University. "In
fact," adds Guy Bailey, a linguist at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas,
"much of our basic understanding of how languages change and develop comes from
our study of black English."

<P>That study has produced a rough consensus on a few points about BEV. One is
that, contrary to the Oakland school board's assertion, it is not a separate
language. "Languages are best defined by their speakers," says Salikoko S.
Mufwene of the University of Chicago. "And almost all blacks will tell you that
they speak English." Linguists also agree that, contrary to some critics'
assertions, BEV is not slang. "Slang refers to a specialized lexicon of words
that are exclusive, that replace other words in function and that tend to have a
short life cycle," Wolfram says. "Groovy" is slang, but "he done gone" is not.
"Like southern English or Appalachian English--or standard English, which really
means educated English," Mufwene says, "BEV is a dialect."

<P>More important than its label, noted a <A HREF="http://www.lsa.umich.edu/ling/jlawler/ebonics.lsa.html">resolution </A>passed in January by the
Linguistics Society of America, is the fact that BEV is as systematic as any
other dialect. "In fact, it has some nuances that standard English does not
express well," Mufwene says. "Many people think African--Americans don't
conjugate the verb 'be,' for example. That is a mistake; they simply use the word
'be' differently. If I say, 'Larry sick,' that means he is sick now. But 'Larry
be sick' means he is usually in the state of sickness. So in BEV you cannot say,
'Larry be sick now'--that is a contradiction."

<P>Historical research also suggests that many of the features that differentiate
black English from mainstream English developed not from ancestral African roots
but from contact with other American populations. "There are features of black
speech that do certainly go back to a creole [a new language formed by the
mixture of two others]. The absence of 'be,' as in 'they workin',' appears in
most Caribbean creoles. But the use of 'be' plus a verb to connote habitual
behavior doesn't appear in records of black English before World War II," Bailey
reports. "The same is true of 'had' plus past tense used as a simple past tense,
such as 'Yesterday I had told him I was coming.'"

<P>Linguists differ on whether BEV is still diverging from the mainstream. "For
every feature you see that appears to be diverging, there are others that are
converging," Wolfram says. "Kids used to say, 'Whassup?' Now they say, 'What up?'
which demonstrates that they know the educated form is 'What is up?'" observes
John Baugh, a linguist at Stanford University. "It is a form of linguistic
defiance." Evidence suggests that among blacks in the South, how--ever, the
nonstandard deletion of unstressed syllables--saying "member" for
"remember"--appears to be waning.

<P>So despite the technical errors in Oakland's policy, many linguists agree with
Bailey, who says "it gets at a real issue. I grew up in southern Alabama and was
the first person in my mother's family to go to high school. When I went to
college and started speaking educated English, there was a sense in which I was
seen as betraying my culture. To successfully educate people from uneducated
backgrounds, you have to understand that they are going to pay a price for
speaking differently. Telling them that they are just wrong is not the best way."

<P>Historically, fertility has varied widely, but beginning in 19th-century
Europe and America, it has generally declined as parents came to favor smaller
families. According to the latest United Nations projections, this trend will
continue, stabilizing the world population early in the 23rd century at somewhat
under 11 billion, compared with about 5.8 billion today.

<P>The map shows the total fertility rate, which indicates the total number of
children the average woman will bear in a lifetime based on the experience of all
women in a given year, in this case, 1996. A rate of less than 2.11 children per
woman will eventually result in a declining population for a country, assuming no
immigration. (The extra 0.11 allows for deaths of children before they reach
reproductive age.) A dip below this rate does not lead to a declining population
until about seven decades or so later, when all those living at the time the
replacement level is reached have died.  Such a case is illustrated by Japan,
which arrived at the replacement level in the 1950s, well before other industrial
nations. The Japanese population will probably level off or decline in the second
decade of the next century.

<P>At the opposite end is sub-Saharan Africa, the poorest region on the globe.
The population here may not stabilize until early in the 23rd century, when it
could reach over two billion. India could achieve a stationary population of more
than 1.5 billion by the late 22nd century, making it more populous than China,
which has stringent limitations on reproduction. The populations of Pakistan,
Nigeria and Ethiopia could stabilize at more than one third of a billion each,
whereas those of Mexico, Vietnam, Iran, Zaire and the Philippines could reach
well over 150 million before leveling off.

<P>Projecting population far into the future naturally involves guesswork, and
this applies particularly to the U.S. because of uncertainties about the future
course of immigration--right now the highest in the world--and the
unpredictability of nonwhite and Hispanic fertility, which are currently well
above replacement levels. The U.S. could conceivably reach a population of more
than half a billion by the 22nd century (U.S. "A" in graph) or, by lowering
fertility and restricting immigration, achieve a population at or below the
current level (U.S. "B").

IN BRIEF

<P><B>Clues from Scleroderma</B>

<P>New results have shed light on why the body sometimes attacks its own tissues:
Antony Rosen and colleagues at <A HREF="http://ww2.med.jhu.edu/deptmed/rheu.html">Johns Hopkins University </A>developed novel means for
tracking the biochemistry behind scleroderma, an autoimmune disorder that damages
the arteries, joints and internal organs. They found that toxic oxygen products,
caused by an irregular blood supply, break apart common tissue molecules when
high levels of metals are present. The fragmented molecules then present
unfamiliar facades to the immune system, which produces antibodies against them.

<P><HR><B>Rapid-Fire Gamma Rays</B>

<P>Four gamma-ray bursts, recorded by NASA instruments over two days last
October, have shot down several key theories. Astrophysicists long thought that
whatever caused the high-energy events, which usually occur at random throughout
the sky, might well be destroyed in the making. But this new series appeared too
quickly, and too close together, to support that idea.

<P><HR><B>Grape Expectations</B>

<P>Scientists grappling for ways to prevent cancer have found new hope in the
humble grape. <A HREF="http://www.pmmp.uic.edu/mcp/jmp.html">John M. Pezzuto</A> and his colleagues at the University of Illinois
found that resveratrol, an abundant compound in grape skins, can block an enzyme
called cyclooxygenase, which catalyzes the conversion of substances that
stimulate tumor growth.


<P><HR><B>Cautioned by Chaos</B>

<P>Ecologists are learning a little mathematics of late. A group led by R. A.
Desharnais of California State University at Los Angeles used chaos theory to
build a <A HREF="http://vflylab.calstatela.edu/edesktop/VirtApps/VflyLab/IntroVflyLab.html">model of population dynamics</A> among flour beetles. The model forecast
chaotic fluctuations in the beetle's numbers after a rise in adult mortality--a
transition later confirmed in lab tests. Based on this finding, the authors
caution ecologists managing large populations: the slightest intervention can
topple a population from stability.


<P><HR><B>Slippery When Wet</B>

<P>Some of the very first molecular-scale images of the surface of ice are
helping to explain why it is so slick. Michel Van Hove and his colleagues at
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory used low-energy electron diffraction to
depict a thin film of ice deposited on platinum at -183 degrees Celsius. They
found that about half the surface molecules were seemingly  invisible. This
absence, Van Hove suggests, occurs because the outermost molecules vibrate more
quickly than those underneath--thus keeping the ice's slippery top coat in a
constantly moving, quasiliquid state.

<P><HR><B>Spinning Bits</B>

<P>In the unending quest to build quantum computers, scientists have again come
one step closer, creating means for storing information using multiple-pulse
magnetic resonance techniques. The method stores bits in atomic spins. Earlier
tactics--which included storing bits by way of trapped ions or quantum
dots--proved hard in practice: the slightest perturbation brought about
decoherence, destroying the data. This new suggestion, put forth by <A HREF="http://neilg.www.media.mit.edu/people/neilg/">Neil A.
Gershenfeld </A>of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and I. L. Chuang of the
University of California at Santa Barbara, however, seems to sidestep those
problems.


<P><HR><B>Breathing an Earful</B>

<P>Zoologists have wondered for some time why, like the blind leading the blind,
earless frogs sing. The tiny, yellow creatures, called Panamanian golden frogs,
lack both a middle and external ear. So to test the frogs' hearing, <A HREF="http://www.biosci.ohio-state.edu/people/resint/hetherington.html">Thomas
Hetherington</A> and his colleagues at Ohio State University set up speakers in the
wild. The frogs turned toward the speakers and actually called out in reply.
Hetherington suspects that the animals' lungs, which are close to the skin, act
like eardrums--a hint, perhaps, into the evolution of hearing.

<P><HR><B>Supersonic Silencer</B>

<P>Dimitri Papamoschou of the University of California at Irvine has invented a
technique to eliminate Mach waves, a major source of the exhaust noise created by
high-performance jet engines. This noise has prevented widespread use of
supersonic passenger aircraft. Current designs for minimizing noise call for
metal shrouds. In contrast, the new method uses no mechanical devices; instead
the exhaust is mixed with a flow of air molecules to create a virtual shroud. The
flow muffles excessive sounds and, unlike the metal shrouds, has little impact on
the engine's overall performance.


<P><HR><B>FOLLOW-UP</B>

<P><B>Fasten Your Seat Belts.</B> A panel assembled by the National Research
Council has advised designers of the international space station to take extra
precaution against a range of road hazards, including falling rocks, meteoroids
and other space debris. Because this 460-ton space Winnebago will be larger than
a football field when it is completed and spend some 15 years in orbit, it is
very likely to encounter collisions with the debris, the panel of experts says.
Shields--made primarily from giant aluminum bumpers--will protect those modules
housing astronauts and critical equipment. (See "Science in the Sky," by Tim Beardsley; 
June 1996)

<P><B>Bug Off.</B> Plants, it appears, can act on the fly--and, well, on other
foraging pests. P. W. Pare and James H. Tumlinson of the U.S. Department of
Agriculture used radioactive carbon for tracking how cotton plants fend off
feeding beet armyworms. They found that, induced by substances in the bug's spit,
damaged cotton leaves could synthesize from scratch several volatile compounds
known to attract the beet armyworm's enemies. Previously, researchers thought
that plants manufactured such repellents from premade ingredients stored in their
leaves. (See "How Parasitic Wasps Find their Hosts," by James H. Tumlinson, W. 
Joe Lewis and Louise E. M. Vet; March 1993)

BIOTECHNOLOGY

<center><H2>MEMORIES ARE MADE OF...</H2>

<B>Pharmaceutical aids to <BR> remembering and forgetting</B>
</center>

<P>To be healthy, a human being needs a memory that works well--but not too well.
The fading remembrances of a patient with Alzheimer's disease slowly erode the
victim's personal identity. A traumatized war veteran, in contrast, is shattered
by too vivid a recall as he cowers when a car backfires nearby.

<P>Biologists have been zeroing in on molecular events that underlie the creation
of memories. Developments are suggesting how drugs might be designed to enhance
or suppress learning and remembering. Cortex Pharmaceuticals in Irvine, Calif.,
has already found a molecule that seems to improve the performance of volunteers
in memory tests. The founders of Helicon Therapeutics in Cold Spring Harbor,
N.Y., have discovered that a protein found in many animals seems to be a crucial
player in forming long-term memories. The company plans to screen for drugs that
will enhance or suppress the protein's action.

<P>Cortex calls its drug candidate Ampalex. The compound emerged from a search
for substances that boost a process referred to as long-term potentiation, which
neuroscientists believe is an important part of the mechanism that records
memories. Junctions known as synapses transmit signals between neurons in the
brain when activity on one side of the junction exceeds a threshold. Long-term
potentiation is the tendency of a busy synapse to lower its threshold, making it
more likely to transmit a signal in the future and so strengthening the
connection.

<P>Gary Lynch of the University of California at Irvine noticed a few years ago
that aniracetam, a drug used in Europe and Japan to treat memory problems,
boosted long-term potentiation in certain neurons, ones that bear signal
receptors of a recently discovered type called AMPA. The drug seems to modify the
AMPA receptors' behavior. He teamed up with chemist Gary Rogers, then at the
University of California at Santa Barbara, who soon created molecules termed
ampakines that had an even stronger effect. Cortex started to investigate the
molecules and in 1994 chose one, Ampalex, to develop as a drug.

<P>Cortex is aiming first to treat memory loss caused by Alzheimer's disease. In
preliminary experiments in Europe the drug boosted the scores of volunteers in
standard tests measuring how well people remember. With the drug, two thirds of
the elderly volunteers quadrupled their scores, to levels typical for people
younger than 35 years. The drug did not obviously affect mood or general
excitability. In the U.S., the National Institute of Neurological Disease and
Stroke is planning to launch a trial of Ampalex in Alzheimer's patients early
this year.

<P>Helicon Therapeutics, currently being established, will be making drug
candidates aimed at different brain molecules. The initial target is a protein
known as CREB. Tim Tully and Jerry C. P. Yin of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,
the company's founders, have shown that the level of CREB in fruit flies' brains
has a striking effect on their ability to learn and remember.

<P>Tully and Yin measured how well flies remembered to avoid an odor that had
been delivered along with an electric shock. Flies genetically engineered to
produce more CREB than normal remember the odor for a week--an eternity for a
fly--after a single training session, although an ordinary fly needs several
sessions. Flies producing less CREB than normal, in contrast, cannot form
long-lasting memories, although their short-term recollections are unaffected.
Alcino J. Silva, also at Cold Spring Harbor, has shown that CREB-deficient mice
likewise have a particular type of long-term memory impairment.

<P>Tully has evidence that CREB activity allows cells in the brain to make
proteins, which are presumably necessary to strengthen synapses. He and his
colleagues are now trying to find the site where CREB operates. They published in
December in <I>Science</I> results showing that a fruit fly's ability to learn
can be abolished by subtle genetic alterations at a crucial location in the fly's
brain. The resulting biochemical changes are likely to influence CREB.

<P>Tully and Yin have developed proprietary techniques to search for drugs that
boost CREB's effects. "Our long-range goal is to become the memory company, 
Tully declares. He sees lucrative future markets not only for drugs that might
boost a failing memory but also for pharmaceuticals that, administered after a
traumatic event, might prevent crippling long-term recollections from arising.

<P>Additional memory drugs might emerge from other work that has started to pin
down the processes of memory in mammals. Recently researchers led by Susumu
Tonegawa of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have shown that for mice to
form memories about places, particular neuronal receptors that permit long-term
potentiation (and that could plausibly affect CREB activity) have to be
functioning in the hippocampus of the brain. That area has long been believed to
be vital for memory.

<P>Observers expect that the breakthroughs in genetic engineering that allowed
the recent crop of results will soon lead to a barrage of new information about
remembering. Commercially, Cortex and Helicon so far have the arena pretty much
to themselves. They are unlikely to keep it that way for long.

POLICY

<center><H2>CHINA SYNDROME</H2>

<B>China's eugenics law makes trouble<BR> for science and business<P>
</B>
</center>

<P>Eugenics produced some of the worst horrors of the century, so geneticists get
jumpy when their expertise is used to coerce. Scientists are now trying to decide
how to respond to a law that came into force in China in 1995 and seems
unabashedly eugenic.

<P>In most of the world, choosing to have a baby is a private matter for two
people. The Chinese Law on Maternal and Infant Health Care, however, stipulates
that if a married couple in childbearing years suffers from a genetic disease "of
a serious nature," the couple "shall take measures in accordance with...medical
advice." Other provisions make plain what measures might be appropriate. Couples
with unspecified genetic diseases "considered to be inappropriate for
childbearing" may be married only if both agree to practice long-term
contraception or to be sterilized.

<P>How to register disapproval has divided Western geneticists. The U.K.'s
Genetical Society, mindful of past abuses ranging from compulsory sterilizations
in North America to genocide elsewhere, has decided to boycott the 1998
International Congress of Genetics in Beijing. The action is "a strong U.K. move
to distance itself from China," says David Sherratt of the University of Oxford,
president of the society. Moreover, an international group of human geneticists,
with the support of some Chinese scientists, last fall urged the government of
China to delay implementing the law until geneticists have discussed the issues.
Some additional societies have also expressed concern, and the American Society
of Human Genetics is studying the questions raised.

<P>Opinions vary on the value of scientific ostracism. Some say a semiboycott by
scientists helped to end apartheid in South Africa. Others counter that a boycott
of the International Congress of Genetics in Moscow in 1978 achieved nothing. In
any event, the protests over China's eugenics law have not affected commerce. The
French biotechnology company Genset is launching a joint venture with the Chinese
Academy of Medical Sciences to carry out surveys in China for genes contributing
to common diseases. Genset will use what it learns to develop novel therapies.
Pascal Brandys, the company's president, replies to critics by noting that the
blood samples his company collects will be anonymous. All donors give informed
consent, Brandys says. Sequana Therapeutics in La Jolla, Calif., is also gene
hunting in China. A company official says it, too, employs Western-style ethical
safeguards when collecting samples.

<P>Promises of good behavior provide only partial reassurance to those who want
to protest. But many geneticists believe they can best help by strengthening
scientific exchanges with China. The International Genetics Federation plans to
engage the country diplomatically by holding a symposium about eugenics at the
Beijing meeting. The Chinese Academy of Sciences's Institute of Genetics is
content with the arrangement, notes Robert Haynes of York University in Toronto,
who is planning the session. "I think those British geneticists are shooting
themselves in the foot with regard to their future esteem in China," Haynes says.

<P>He points out that it is unclear how the Chinese law is being implemented. In
a country where millions of female children vanish--presumably killed--and many
children with developmental abnormalities are left to die, the law might
represent an improvement, Haynes suggests. The eugenic provisions specify no
penalties, and the law does, for example, prohibit the abortion of fetuses simply
because they happen to be female. John Drake of the National Institute of
Environmental Health Sciences in North Carolina, who chairs an advisory committee
to the federation, says he believes the law is intended to be advisory: "Few
Westerners have an appreciation of the magnitude of the population problem China
is trying to come to grips with."

<P>Complexities abound, but the Chinese government is not making things easier.
It has shown no inclination to revise the law, and it has not repudiated a
statement attributed in 1994 to Chen Mingzhang, minister of public health, that
seems to confirm the critics' worst fears. Chen reportedly said births of
"inferior quality" are serious among "the old revolutionary base" and "ethnic
minorities" as well as the poor and those near "the frontier." With public
spokespeople like that, China probably does not need any more enemies.

<FONT SIZE=1>Image:Thomas A.
Sebring</FONT><P><FONT SIZE=2><B>HOBBY-EBERLY TELESCOPE</B> demonstrates
that<BR> big science need not be big-budget science.</FONT></TD>

<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=336>
<p>
Who would build a giant telescope that cannot move up and down? A consortium
led by the University of Texas at Austin and Pennsylvania State University,
that's who. The contradiction between observers' ever more ambitious plans and
harsh fiscal realities encouraged the universities to back the <A HREF="http://www.as.utexas.edu/mcdonald/het/het.html">Hobby-Eberly
Telescope</A> (HET) at the McDonald Observatory in Texas. The telescope's
stripped-down design offers high performance at a bargain price. Its
light-gathering mirror stretches 11 meters across, the world's largest, but its
$13.5-million construction budget is a mere fraction of that of other giant
telescopes.

<P>HET was dreamed up in the recession years of the early 1980s by Lawrence W.
Ramsey and Daniel Weedman of Penn State. In their quest for efficiency, they
reconsidered almost everything that one typically associates with a
telescope-including the ability to point in any direction. The telescope's gaze
is permanently tipped 35 degrees from vertical, although it can rotate on its
base. A small, movable focusing instrument above the main mirror tracks
astronomical images across the sky. Reduced mobility means a much simpler,
cheaper telescope. "We're getting 70 percent of the sky for 15 percent of the
price," Ramsey says.

<P>HET's innovations extend to the way it is being built and managed. Under the
guidance of project manager Thomas A. Sebring, "first light"-the inaugural
testing of the telescope-took place last December 10, just three years after
groundbreaking. When it begins regular operations in the fall of this year, HET
will work around a flexible "cue schedule," in which an observer's time might be
split into discrete blocks over several nights, thereby maximizing the efficiency
with which it shifts its gaze from object to object. Electronic light detectors
will seamlessly store the light from the disparate viewing sessions. Even the
low-key publicity that has surrounded the project is related to its lean
management: "The publicity team is the project team, and we've been busy building
the telescope," Ramsey explains.<P>

<P>The result is a bargain compared with the similarly sized Keck I telescope on
Mauna Kea in Hawaii, which cost nearly $100 million. Ramsey is quick to point out
that Keck is a far more capable and flexible device. But there is no shortage of
tasks waiting for HET. The telescope will peer into the central regions of active
galaxies and quasars, where giant black holes seem to be stirring gas into a
white-hot frenzy. It will also help measure the distances and composition of the
most remote quasars and galaxy clusters, and it will aid in the search for
planets around other stars.

<P>Other astronomers are likewise discovering the economic benefits of automation
and narrowed goals. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., and the
U.S. Air Force have collaborated on a new electronic camera, the Near-Earth
Asteroid Tracking System; for a modest $1 million, the system is producing a
vastly improved survey of the asteroids and comets that venture disconcertingly
close to the earth. Another innovative project, the $500,000 Katzman Automated
Imaging Telescope at the University of California at Berkeley, conducts
computer-controlled surveys for supernova explosions in remote galaxies, which
will help determine the age and fate of the universe.

<P>Astronomers, it seems, are learning from corporate downsizing. "The idea of
HET is exploiting niches," Ramsey notes. "You can do everything and pay a lot of
money, or do some things and pay a lot less."

Review by <A HREF="#author">Luciano da F. Costa</A>

<P><B>The Object Stares Back</B>
<BR>BY JAMES ELKINS
<BR>Simon & Schuster, 1996 ($24)</center>


<P>Second to no machine in its performance, human vision is--or at least seems to
be--comprehensive, effortless and instantaneous. There is a tendency to consider
it pure in its simplicity, to think of the image we see as a direct impression of
the world outside ourselves. Yet vision is an elaborate process that demands
about half the overall capacity of the primate brain's cortex. And even with that
complexity (indeed, often because of it), vision is in fact limited in many
aspects. The dynamic and often contradictory nature of seeing is the organizing
theme of this interesting, but sometimes gloomy book, which covers many issues
not usually considered in texts on visual science.

<P>James Elkins, an art historian by training, sets out by denying the popular
concept of vision as a passive activity--that we are "just looking." In reality,
our eyes are constantly and actively seeking something, whether we are visiting
an art museum or just watching the clouds roll by. Furthermore, seeing is not
entirely under our control. When and where our gaze settles next is to a great
extent determined by our surroundings and by what we had been looking at before.

<P>The notion of vision as an active process is easily grasped; Elkins's idea
that objects "stare back" is not so straightforward, because Elkins does not
advance a conclusive or exact definition of this concept. It is left to the
reader, as he or she progresses through the many instances and arguments
presented in the book, to formulate a version of the concept. Perhaps the
simplest explanation provided by Elkins is through the notion that many objects
possess "eyes," that is, distinctive visual features that draw our attention.
Such eye-endowed objects include those that are particularly appealing (a
tempting piece of pie, for example), potentially harmful (a banana skin on the
floor) or psychologically charged (a credit card). The property of staring back
is a graded one, shared in varying intensity by virtually all visible objects.

<P>Elkins unfortunately misses a chance to discuss the process of staring back
from a neurological angle. Much of the reactive nature of objects arises as a
consequence of the activation of memories associated with that object, as they
are retrieved and integrated with our visual perception, often producing some
motor reaction. Hence, it is not properly the object itself but rather its
representation stored in our brain, with all its associated connotations, that
looks back at us.

<P>Another intriguing issue raised in <I>The Object Stares Back</I> is the
inconstancy of vision--more specifically, the many objects that we usually fail
to see. Elkins documents quite effectively our peculiar tendency to overlook
certain things: the most extraordinary phenomena (multiple rainbows, sun dogs,
meteors and so on) may take place in the sky and yet go unnoticed by almost
everybody. Obviously, what we see and what we overlook is influenced by our
interests, habits, background and even mood. Also partially invisible are those
pictures that are too physically or psychologically intense, such as the sun,
genitals and images of death. Our visual system functions as a filter designed to
satisfy our basic needs in our typical environment; we do not usually see
features such as sun dogs, because they are distractions from our customary
activities. In human eyesight, nature has achieved an efficiency unmatched by any
artificial visual system.

<P>In the course of human evolution, visual breadth did not always guarantee
evolutionary success. Neanderthals, who possessed a large occipital region
dedicated to visual processing, became extinct, whereas we, with our more limited
visual capabilities but increased capacity in the frontal region, prevailed. It
seems reasonable to speculate that the increased reasoning and planning abilities
conferred by the enlarged frontal cortex--even at the expense of better
vision--may have improved Homo sapiens' chances for survival. Evolutionary
biology offers reasonable explanations for many other peculiarities of our visual
system. It is a pity that Elkins does not address them in greater depth.

<P>Just as there are some types of objects that tend to go unnoticed, there are
also those that especially attract our visual perception. Bodies and faces, the
most prominent of these, each earn an entire chapter in <I>The Object Stares
Back.</I> As Elkins observes, bodies and faces are so special that we often try
to see them in cars, buildings, abstract artistic objects or even in random
natural formations (take, for instance, the infamous "face on Mars"). Some of
this response is possibly hardwired into the brain. And there is concrete
physiological evidence indicating that some neurons in the primate cortex are
particularly responsive to the visual stimuli associated with observing a face.

<P>One of the most paradoxical concepts presented concerns a blurring of the
distinction between vision and blindness. Although we are rarely aware of it,
only a small part of our retina, the fovea, is capable of high-resolution vision.
The severe constraints implied by foveal vision can be easily verified by
performing the following classic experiment from psychophysics. Hold the page 20
to 30 centimeters (eight to 12 inches) away and stare at the asterisk in the
following group of numbers and letters.

<P><B>2nq2hhs48awqpoiug93hd7hh38bf 30gu84ng0e84nc957gn40fjv8n6
1h374hc08h73*e5ndfg8h74h5fd 0jn58fn30as81h203akoqw893w
g983h49hsdfkypq8w34885af33rp2rb</B>

<P>Now, without moving your eyes, try to identify how many neighboring characters
you can clearly discern.

<P>No need to despair if you have recognized only two or three characters--that
is actually the standard performance. Our vision appears comprehensive because we
can scan our surroundings and integrate the observed details into our memory. The
process determining where we look next is of course biased toward those visual
features that are of the most interest--or most capable of "looking back," in
Elkins's terminology.

<P>In exploring the frail border between vision and blindness, Elkins considers a
remarkable phenomenon called blindsight, in which patients having damaged visual
cortices are still able subconsciously to perceive simple visual features. He
goes rather far out on a limb and interprets the act of drawing as a dialogue
with blindness. Because artists may have no definitive pictures in their head
before they start to draw, the final work only emerges as the artist
painstakingly dominates the blindness represented by the blank canvas.
Theoretical though it sounds, this concept does take on a certain power when one
views unfinished masterpieces such as Michelangelo's Captives, who seem to be
struggling with the blindness represented by the rough surface of the unfinished
part.

<P>In the end, Elkins's interdisciplinary account of vision manages to cover a
lot of territory while demanding no prerequisites from the reader. It also
contains some memorable ideas. In the afterword, he cites a peacock as the
ultimate instance of "vision made visible": the animal includes visual features
that look back (the eyespots in their plumage), others that trap our visual
attention (the convergent plumage pattern) and things that cannot be seen (the
large feathers in the middle of the plumage). After reading <i>The Object Stares
Back</i>, you will not be able to look at a peacock again without recalling that
there is more to the world than meets the eye.

<P><B>The Very First Light: The True<BR>
 Inside Story of the Scientific <BR>Journey Back 
to the Dawn of the Universe
</B>
<BR>BY JOHN C. MATHER AND JOHN BOSLOUGH
<BR><A HREF="http://www.harpercollins.com/basic/">BasicBooks,</A> 1996 ($27.50)</center>


<P>Somewhere between 10 and 15 billion years ago, a flash of radiation marked the
beginning of the universe. This radiation filled the cosmos with energy, part of
which soon transformed itself into the matter we see today. The expansion of the
universe steadily lengthened the wavelength and lowered the energy of every
photon in the sea of radiation until, after about 300,000 years, the photons of
the cosmic radiation had grown so weak that they no longer interacted with the
other particles. This "decoupling" of radiation and matter allowed atoms to form
and led to the evolution of the modern universe: galaxies, stars and ourselves.
The cosmic radiation, meanwhile, grew ever weaker but continued to permeate all
of space, a relic of the fierce brilliance of the big bang.

<P>This scenario, briefly outlined in the opening chapters of <I>The Very First
Light,</I> was first envisioned during the early 1950s by Ralph Alpher, George
Gamow and Robert Herman, who predicted that the cosmos must still be suffused
with what astronomers now call the cosmic background radiation (CBR). More than a
decade later, in 1965, Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson of AT&T Bell Laboratories
serendipitously detected the CBR. Their work won them a Nobel Prize and provided
stunning confirmation that the big bang is a scientifically accurate description
of the birth of the universe, at least in its present phase.

<P>The discovery of the CBR spurred astronomers to obtain two crucial sets of
observations that would reveal some of the basic details of how the universe was
born; the technical efforts, scientific collaborations and occasionally bitter
disputes behind that quest form the heart of the book.

<P>The first key observation was to measure the spectrum of the cosmic radiation
to determine whether it matched the ideal-radiator shape predicted by nearly all
cosmological theories. The second goal, even more challenging, was to find small
variations in the amounts of radiation arriving from different directions in
space. These differences would have arisen from tiny local inequalities in the
density of matter during the epoch of decoupling. Theorists believed such
variations were the "seeds" that led to the formation of galaxies and clusters of
galaxies within a billion years or so after the big bang. To achieve these twin
goals, astronomers needed to rise above the earth's distorting atmosphere. John
C. Mather, a researcher at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
Goddard Space Flight Center, and his colleagues conceived a sophisticated,
expensive satellite observatory--the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE)--and
persuaded NASA to build it, to launch it and to analyze its data. The task took
15 years but ended in complete success, ushering in a new era in cosmological
understanding.

<P>In <I>The Very First Light,</I> Mather, who became the project scientist for
COBE, has collaborated with science writer John Boslough to tell the satellite's
full story, reaching all the way back to the project's conceptual roots in the
early 1970s. As the authors recount, COBE traveled a rocky road to reach the
earth's orbit. It was originally designed for launch by the space shuttle into a
pole-to-pole orbit, which is essential for accurate measurements of the CBR.

<P>After the <i>Challenger</i> disaster in 1986, however, NASA abandoned plans to use
the shuttle for polar-orbit launches. Under immense pressure to reengineer COBE
before the entire project was canceled, Mather worked long hours with teams of
scientists and engineers to reduce the weight of the satellite by half (so that
it could fit onto a Delta rocket) without sacrificing its key observational
capabilities.

<P>Mather was not only the chief scientist for the COBE satellite but also the
principal investigator for one of its three detectors, the experiment to measure
the spectrum of the cosmic radiation. Before COBE's launch in November 1989, some
scientists had reported detecting baffling deviations in the spectrum, which
conventional cosmological theories were at a loss to explain. So when Mather
stood before a packed house at the American Astronomical Society's meeting in
January 1990 to display the first COBE results, he was settling a high-stakes
controversy. COBE's measurement exactly conformed to the big bang model, fitting
the standard "blackbody" spectrum so perfectly that it might have been copied
from a physics textbook. More than 1,000 astronomers burst into spontaneous,
heartwarming applause; the authors describe it as "a moment of supreme epiphany."

<P>Then came the still more difficult task: COBE's second key instrument, the
differential microwave radiometer (DMR), sought to find the subtle evidence of
the seeds of long-vanished galaxy formation. It took more than two years of
computer analysis and statistical techniques to sort through the data in search
of the tiny differences in intensity that would verify theorists' predictions of
how galaxies began to form. George Smoot of Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, the
principal investigator for the DMR, spearheaded the task.

<P>On April 23, 1992, Smoot announced at a meeting of the American Physical
Society that the long-awaited galaxy seeds had been found. After his talk, he and
other COBE scientists faced a media corps hungry for news on an otherwise slow
day. Smoot's throwaway line, "If you're religious, it's like looking at God,"
reverberated far and wide; before the week was out, a leading literary agent was
marketing Smoot's book proposal to 17 countries. The media focus on Smoot arose
in part because he had apparently arranged for his institution to issue a press
release without the usual consultation with NASA or anyone else but, even more,
because the media needed a hero to connect with COBE's immense but abstruse
scientific discovery. It is also easy to speculate that Smoot, who had once found
his co-investigator receiving most of the credit for painstaking observations of
the cosmic radiation they had jointly made from a U-2 spy plane, was in no mood
to lose a second chance for glory.

<P>Along with the rest of the COBE team, Mather was justifiably outraged by
Smoot's hogging of the second big COBE story. The penultimate chapter of <I>The
Very First Light</I> presents the "true inside story" of what Mather considers to
be Smoot's betrayal of the agreements among the COBE scientists concerning how
they would make announcements and claim credit. To set the record straight,
Mather and Boslough carefully describe the contributions of unsung COBE heroes,
including Ray Weiss, a brilliant experimental physicist; Ned Wright, who
performed heroic data analyses; and Nancy Boggess, an astronomer at NASA
headquarters who nursed COBE onward through many crises.

<P>This section includes passages in which Mather, who is one of the sweetest
scientists one may encounter, seems to engage in overkill. For example, he quotes
Boggess's reaction to Smoot's statement that NASA had made him the principal
investigator for the DMR experiment because of his previous work on the CBR.
"That was a lie," Boggess said: NASA wanted to give this position to a more
senior investigator, Dave Wilkinson, "but I knew that Dave would never do it, so
I ended up picking [Smoot] almost by default." This non sequitur underlines how
different bureaucratic infighting looks from within and from without. Even if
Smoot were NASA's third or fourth choice as principal investigator, was it a lie
for him to say that NASA picked him for his experience?

<P>The book's final chapter discusses science after COBE. (Mather is now the
chief scientist for the Next Generation Space Telescope, the planned successor to
the Hubble Space Telescope.) A new family of instruments--ground-based,
balloon-borne and eventually on other satellites--will provide more detailed maps
of the CBR, necessary to refine our models of the early evolution of the
universe.

<P>By the turn of the millennium, we should be ready for a new book that will
describe how scrutiny of the cosmic background radiation has unlocked the secrets
of the long-vanished epochs when galaxies began to form. For now, those readers
who seek a cogent overview of the cosmic radiation without much sociological
insight will do best with Marcus Chown's new <i>Afterglow of Creation</i>; those who
want to learn about the CBR and Smoot's career can enjoy Wrinkles in Time, which
Smoot wrote with Keay Davidson. But those who want the complete history of COBE
and its observations of the CBR will want to read <I>The Very First Light,
</I>which effectively describes how it felt to be at the center of the greatest
effort in observational cosmology of the late 20th century.

<P><B>THE SCIENTIFIC 100: A RANKING OF THE MOST INFLUENTIAL SCIENTISTS, PAST AND
PRESENT</B> <BR><I>by John Simmons. Citadel Press, 1996 ($29.95).</I>

<P>The very act of creating such a ranking is an invitation to conflict. Few
might deny Isaac Newton (right) his place atop the list. But who could dare
presume to deduce that the historical legacy of Euclid slots him between Gregor
Mendel and Hans Bethe or that physiologist Claude Bernard (number 13) trounces
Archimedes (dead last at 100)? The reader's cries of outrage are, of course,
entirely the point. Disputing the author's order entails plunging headlong into
the achievements of 100 great minds and mulling the vicissitudes of fame.

<P><HR><B>FANFARE FOR EARTH, </B> <BR><I>by Harry Y. McSween, Jr. St. Martin's
Press, 1997 ($23.95).</I>

<P>We are all made of stardust, but the story of how supernova debris became
planets and people is neither simple nor fully understood. Harry McSween, a
geologist by trade, begins his story with the accretion and evolution of the
earth and follows it to the relatively recent development of its thin skin of
living creatures. His narrative traces both planetary history and the history of
the sciences that have enabled us to understand where we came from.

<P><HR><B>SPERM WARS: THE SCIENCE OF SEX,</B> <BR><I>by Robin Baker. <A
HREF="http://www.harpercollins.com/basic/">BasicBooks,</A> 1996 ($25).</I>

<P>Wholeheartedly embracing the notion of science as a candle illuminating the
dark, Robin Baker charges into the bedroom to make sense of the often secretive
aspects of human sexuality. The format is unconventional, to say the least: 37
fictional scenes of carnal behavior alternate with the author's bold
interpretations. Female orgasm allows control over sperm retention, he argues,
whereas males produce a vast oversupply of sperm in each ejaculation because most
of the cells are decoys or hunters intended to fend off competitors from another
partner. As a researcher, Baker turns out to be a bit of a tease: he offers
little insight into his lab work and no references for those who are ready to
commit to something a little deeper.


<P><HR><B>THE CAMBRIDGE ILLUSTRATED <BR>HISTORY OF MEDICINE.</B> <BR><I>Edited by Roy
Porter. Cambridge University Press, 1996 ($39.95).</I>

<P>Illness and attempts to treat it are essential parts of humanitys
evolutionary heritage. Medicine has shaped our culture even as it has been shaped
by it. Countless paintings, engravings and even a cuneiform description of
epilepsy from 650 B.C. record the fascination that disease and attempts to cure
it have held for artists and chroniclers. In 10 well-written chapters, Roy Porter
and his collaborators examine the changing form of medicine and the growing body
of technical successes that it has achieved. They also ponder an ironic paradox:
even as medical science advances, there appears to be an increase in public
concern about health and growing dissatisfaction with health care. The empathy
and compassion that were once physicians' staple tools may have become outmoded,
but no drug or operation seems to have effectively replaced them.

<P><HR><B>DEEP ATLANTIC,</B> <BR><I>by  Richard Ellis. <A
HREF="http://www.randomhouse.com/knopf/index.html">Alfred A. Knopf,</A> 1996 ($35).</I>

<P>The earth's territory 1,000 fathoms below the waves is less well known to us
than are the surface features of the moon or Mars. Despite the enormous pressure
and the temperatures barely above freezing, the region apparently supports
abundant life. And bizarre life it is, judging from the specimens that weighted
nets, dredges and occasional submersible forays have brought back. Creatures from
the hadal regions (named after the ancient underworld) may be brightly colored
even though they live in such utter darkness that many of them have no eyes.
Deep-sea predatory fish look like something out of a nightmare or cartoon.
Richard Ellis, a marine artist, sketches the history of undersea exploration and
glides the reader along a richly illustrated path across the bottom of the
world's best-studied ocean.

<H2>Revolutionary Stuff</H2>


<P>I was enjoying a recent partial solar eclipse in London and thinking about how
after Copernicus came out with <I>De revolutionibus orbium coelestium,</I> in
which he made the shocking assertion that the earth moved in orbit just like the
other planets, it really was for his contemporaries, as they often said, that
"the world turned upside down." Because if you put the sun instead of the earth
at the center of everything, you rocked the entire boat: the old "fixed" order of
things (and the church that said so); man as the center of the universe (and the
church that said so); the heavens that were beyond investigation (and the church
that said so).

<P>No wonder Andreas Osiander (Lutheran mathematician and religious fanatic)
tried to persuade Copernicus to write a smoke-and-mirror preface saying it was
all just astronomers' mathematical fiction. Otherwise, Osiander said, there was a
good chance Copernicus would be in deep and potentially fatal doo-doo with Rome.
But since Copernicus was dying anyway, what did he care? In the event, while
Copernicus's editor, Rheticus, was out of town (Nuremberg, where the work was
being printed), Osiander, temporary replacement editor, slipped in his own
preface, with the "fiction" message. By the time the thing blew up (Rheticus went
ballistic), it was too late. And De Revolutionibus was off the hook enough to
survive the censor. More or less.

<P>Osiander was a priest who dabbled in astrology and mathematics, and at one
point he corresponded with an Italian, Gerolamo Cardano, who shared his
interests. Cardano was quite a guy. From being in trouble with the Inquisition,
he then became a pal of the Pope. He also wrote more than 200 works on everything
from music to philosophy to algebra to gambling. It was his luck with the dice
(possibly because he came up with the first law of probability) that enabled him
to pay his way through college. By 1540 he was already making a name as a math
popularizer and algebra genius, dedicating his great work on the latter subject
(<I>Ars Magna</I>) to his editor, Osiander.

<P>Cardano was also the second-best doctor in Europe and made one of the first
detailed studies of asthma (that took him off for a strange adventure in
Scotland, but more of that in another column). We know he met the best doctor in
Europe, because he cast the latter's horoscope. As a result of which it's said
that Andreas Vesalius was born in Brussels at 5:45 on December 31, 1514. Vesalius
advanced the state of medicine from potions of boiled puppy, lily leaves and
minced earthworms to modern anatomy with his new show-and-tell book called On the
Structure of the Human Body (1543), which literally took humans apart: brain,
blood vessels, nerves, bones, muscles. The work was made easier thanks to a
helpful judge in Padua, Italy (where Vesalius was professor), who supplied the
author with fresh corpses of executed criminals more or less to order. The book
was a boffo success, triggering an epidemic of grave robbing by medical student
wannabes.

<P>Part of the reason this new "what you see is what you get" approach made such
an impact was because of its artwork, done by the studio of a new rising star in
the elite Venetian world of portrait painting: Titian. And what Titian was all
about (as any art historian will tell you) was the most fantastic skin-tone work
anybody had ever seen. He even went so far as to make Madonnas and Venuses look
like real, flesh-and-blood women.

<P>Titian's stuff was so lifelike that people doffed their hats when they passed
his 1545 picture of Pope Paul III. So in no time he was turning down commissions
right and left from queens, cardinals, dukes, princes and other such biggies. But
there was one particular offer he just couldn't refuse: to paint the Holy Roman
emperor Charles V, who was in Augsburg at the time, having just won a battle with
the Lutheran princes, and who wanted a little commemorative number done. Titian
sat him on a horse in full parade armor (the suit he'd worn to watch the recent
battle). And you might conclude, on viewing the finished work in Madrid's Prado
Museum, that the emperor was screwed. Well, the thing on his armor might be a
wing nut, but either way, that's how they fixed plate armor onto you.

<P>Augsburg, being a metalworking center, was the home of the screw. And one of
the local goldsmiths was a fellow called Max Schwab, who sometime after 1550 got
an invite to send one of his fancy balance presses to the Louvre in Paris to make
some not so fancy coins for Henry II. These had a reduced precious-metal content,
the idea being that devaluation would help shore up Henry's tottering finances
and also leave enough for his wife, Catherine de Mdicis, to spend on her
diplomatic megabuffets. At one of which she might well have passed around a new,
recreational drug she'd been sent by the French ambassador to Portugal.

<P>If I tell you his name was Jean Nicot, you'll be there ahead of me. Tobacco
went through European high society (and then the rest) like an addiction waiting
to be taxed. Soon enough, when James I of England upped the customs duty on it
more than 30 times, it became the first of many examples of a harmful but
fiscally remunerative commodity. So, before you knew it, mercantilism was the new
buzzword. Tobacco sales started pouring cash into national coffers, and the new
European trick became setting up colonies to make even more green stuff from the
green stuff.

<P>Unfortunately, with a navy of a few dozen rotting hulks, that left
17th-century France potentially out of the get-rich game. Until a new
controller-general of finance, Jean-Baptiste Colbert, took over and turned the
economy around with everything from tax incentives for explorers (which is when
French Africa started) to a budding domestic transportation network. Including
the Canal du Midi (still there for holiday boating), for which he engaged the
services of a military engineering genius named Sbastien Le Prestre de Vauban,
who did one of the aqueducts.

<P>Vauban was a mover and shaker. He predicted what the population of Canada
would be in 2000 A.D. (51 million) and wrote on beekeeping, silk manufacture, pig
farming and taxation. He built major fortresses all around the French frontier
and invented the socket bayonet. He also came up with a totally new kind of siege
tactic. We call it trench warfare: dig a trench, fill it with firepower so as to
cover the men digging another trench nearer the enemy walls. Go on doing that
until you're right under the walls. Then undermine them with explosives and blow
them up. Unless you've undermined enemy morale so much they give up before you
have to.

<P>Which is just what happened on October 19, 1781, when General Cornwallis and
his troops surrendered the fort of Yorktown in Virginia and marched out,
signaling the victory of the Americans over the British. And you know what the
band played as they left? A little march entitled "The World Turned Upside Down."

<P>In the past year only a trickle of money on the World Wide Web has actually
made its way toward consumer goods such as books, flowers and airline tickets.
But the Web has actually produced a bona fide financial hit--intranets. These
systems are networks that are generally accessible only to select users and that
rely on the rules of the Internet that permit computers to "talk" to one another.
Unlike their rambunctious, flashy Internet cousins, intranets (and extranets, or
networks extended to branches and business partners) are the emerging
bourgeoisie--stable, productive money earners, the economic bedrock of
cyberspace.

<P>Convinced that they will increase profits, U.S. companies are ready to pay for
the Web technology to create them. The market for intranets is estimated to reach
at least $9 billion by 2000 or perhaps even more: Zona Research, a consulting
firm in Redwood City, Calif., thinks annual spending on intranets will exceed $13
billion by 1999. Netscape, Sun Microsystems and Lotus/IBM are already competing
fiercely for this enormous market, and so, too, looming over them all, is the
Godzilla of Redmond, Wash., Microsoft.

<P>Intranets have earned their status by efficiently performing many unglamorous
but useful tasks: publishing job postings and searchable versions of technical
reports, managing supply chains and distribution channels, letting workers check
on matters ranging from their health plan to the daily specials in the cafeteria.

<P>Although they are today's signature business phenomenon, intranets began so
modestly that until two years ago they did not even have their own name.
According to Katie Hafner and Matthew Lyon's history of the origins of the
Internet (<A
HREF="http://www.simonsays.com/30892398354417/titles/0684812010/index.html">Where
Wizards Stay Up Late, </A>Simon & Schuster, 1996), in the mid-1980s "internet"
with a small "i" was the term for any network using the standard suite of
Internet TCP/IP parameters. (TCP, for transmission control protocol, breaks up
and reassembles messages on the Net; IP, for Internet protocol, controls the
structure of transmitted data and defines the addressing mechanism used to
deliver them.) With an initial capital, Internet stood for the public, federally
subsidized network made up of linked networks running TCP/IP.

<P>The Internet/internet spelling was still the distinction in late 1995, when
writer Brent Schlender visited Eric Schmidt, chief technology officer at Sun
Microsystems. Schlender thought "intranet" was a less confusing term, and his
colleague Alison Sprout later tried the new word out in print in <I>Fortune. </I>

<P>Web-based intranets emerged humbly, typically as simple publishing tools in
human resources departments, home of the myriad documents needed by virtually
everyone within a company. The sites proved useful--they saved paper and reduced
time spent handling routine telephone calls. Indeed, such intranets earned
enviable returns on investments; one study by Internal Data Corporation in
Framingham, Mass., found that Netscape intranets produced returns of more than
1,000 percent.

<P>Meanwhile, within companies, many people had started to build their own
internal Web sites. If 1996 began as the year that everyone put up home pages but
didn't know what to do with them, it ended with many firms realizing that the
value of their internal Web sites went beyond the personnel department: they let
business partners or a sales force keep in touch and workers share information
and collaborate effectively. In short, they boosted productivity.

<P>"The Web is not something that a corporation has to decide to use," says Bill
Raduchel, Sun Microsystems's chief information officer. "Once you have a TCP/IP
network, a handful of people can create a Web site. Kids create them; people see
how good they are. The sites compound and expand. Of the 2,000-plus Web sites
within Sun, only one was created by the company," he notes.

<P>By the end of 1996, Netscape had repositioned itself as an intranet
infra-structure company, ready for what CEO Jim Barksdale called the next wave
for the Net: groupware. Intranets are inherently collaborative, and
groupware--software that many users can run at the same time--takes advantage of
this characteristic. Network users could simultaneously view complex data or
employ hypertext links in their e-mail so that they could seamlessly send their
401(k) forms back to human resources.

<P>Groupware is emerging as the key battleground of the intranet wars between
Netscape, Microsoft and Lotus. Lotus pioneered groupware when it introduced its
highly regarded Notes software in 1989. In the past two years, though, Lotus has
migrated to an IP base and is now Web-enabled. Through a browser, intranet users
can sample Notes's complex, elegant features: identical, perfectly updated files
for all those who open the folder (multiple servers present the same data);
threaded discussions; and work-flow applications, which not only track packages,
for instance, but also automatically inform the right people when a package goes
astray.

<P>Best of all, if you don't want to own a full-service intranet, you can rent
one. Lotus, for example, will supply a virtual intranet for those who want to
organize an international meeting or draw up a contract. Just choose the
groupware functions you want--say, document sharing. Within the hour, according
to Steven Brand, a director at Lotus, participants can check into their
password-protected URL (uniform resource locator--a Web address) and go to work
commenting and revising at their convenience. Lotus plans to sell the groupware
wholesale to Internet service providers, who, Brand says, will charge about $10
to $30 a month for each user. At the least, intranets are going to lead to far
fewer documents shipped overnight.

<P>"Late and in entirely unexpected ways, IP inside corporations is finally going
to deliver what people had hoped for all along from the Internet," comments Paul
Saffo of the Institute for the Future, a think tank in Menlo Park, Calif. "The
promised goods--intellectual capital. The IP will be the vortex around which all
this happens."

<P>Hardly a week passes without bringing its dramatic image of some molecular
scene. One recent tour de force of the modern nano-scene studios was an atomic
abacus, the counting beads ranked in parallel grooves, and the entire device
built of neatly distinct molecules and atoms. Such images are the product of a
scanning probe microscope. It uses no focused beam of photons or particles;
instead direct physical contacts are mapped as atom after atom is probed in turn.
The brightness or darkness of each picture element depends on the strength of an
interaction between an atom and the probe end; it may be a tiny current tunneling
between the two or the localized force between the surfaces as the probe
delicately taps away. Such pictures magnify distances within the minuscule scene
by a few million times.

<table cellpadding=1 align=right width=175><tr><td>

<P>It took us a while to realize that images so made are not unknown at our own
scale. Who has not seen an ancient relief carving in stone beautifully rendered
in black on flat paper, the highlights and recesses felt out and recorded by
rubbing a suitable crayon over the whole scene? The atomic images popular today
are a kind of atomic rubbing, made with a fine crayon indeed.

<P>So far the markers used have been less than the best--a metal wire etched at
hazard to a jagged crystalline point or the smooth but blunt end of a
microfabricated silicon lever. But lately, wonderful nanotubes--carbon atoms
linked into a fullerene latticework--have been put to the task. Made in bulk in a
carbon arc, they are amazingly thin, strong and stiff, a fraction of a micron
long, with a rounded tip a dozen atomic widths across. A single "crayon" is stuck
by adhesive to the silicon probe, which is now only a handle to be steered deftly
under the optical microscope. Test images show the virtues of this probe: a set
of submicron grooves etched in metal appears under the cruder silicon tip as
V-shaped valleys with wavy surfaces, but the carbon tube reaches deeper, to show
the walls as smooth, vertical cliffs and the flat valley bottom textured on the
scale of a few atoms.

<P>The virtuoso display of the true atomic granularity has supported a close look
at matter that is granular on our own gross scale. Loose millimeter grains piled
up in good number offer a tempting stand-in for the huge arrays of real,
invisible but cohesive atoms. They have economic importance, too, for commerce
transports such grains by the billions of tons every year, notably our staple
foods, the seeds of wheat, rice and corn. What agriculturists and engineers have
worked at for a long time has now become a fascinating challenge for the
physicists. Dozens of labs worldwide study this kind of incoherent matter, both
in motion and at rest under gravity, using clever bench-top experiments and
elaborate numerical simulation.

<P>A few thousand mustard seeds piled on a slightly tilted table resemble a model
crystal, rather uniform spheres locally ordered. But tilt the barely stable pile
just a little more, and a sudden surface avalanche pours downslope, leaving the
deeper-lying seeds entirely undisturbed. No real fluid acts like that!

<P>Certainly, surface is newly important in so small a sample of "atoms." Pour
water into a tall cylinder, and the pressure at the bottom will steadily increase
with water level. For granules, the bottom pressure soon reaches a limit and
grows little more under greater depth. Grains feel friction and send forces
sideways to share the weight between bottom and walls. That is the basic theory
of the hourglass, explained a century ago: sand flows more or less uniformly
through the orifice even as the level of sand above decreases. There are hundreds
of reports using stand-in atoms at millimeter scale: grains of sand, mustard
seeds, beads of glass and metals are in the current physics literature. One
experiment used polenta!

<P>The real temperature of the grain material is not directly relevant, for the
thermal motions of atoms within the grains do not affect the motion of a grain as
a whole. Friction surely does, and internal energy losses dominate the repeated
collisions between grains. The lossy grain motion diffuses swiftly into abrasion,
heat, even sound, and the energy of motion is all but gone after a few dozen
collisions. When an atom gains or loses energy of motion, it has merely passed it
to a partner. For real atoms rebound perfectly until a quantum jump occurs, an
event rare at modest temperatures. In the time a moving seed requires for 1,000
collisions with neighbors or walls, an air molecule will collide and rebound a
trillion times. Big, slow grains have no time to search out all the opportunities
open in the swifter world of atoms.

<P>Recently, in a marvelously direct experiment, a few thousand millimeter-size
glass beads were photographed packed into a small, clear box. A fluid was added
that matched the refractive index of the glass very well, so that the beads lost
all contrast. Viewed through a pair of crossed polarizers, the scene was dark and
bland, no beads to be seen. Then a few pounds of pressure were applied to the top
of the sample by a small piston. Pressure-stressed glass rotates polarized light,
so a number of long chains of beads showed up. The chains twisted their way
awkwardly through the container. Most weight was borne by a few strings of
tightly contacting beads, with no semblance of the uniformity of fluid pressure.
Maybe over a long time the beads might relax toward uniformity, or will that
appear only in the average behavior over many trials?

<P>Granular motion itself is in no way a faithful model of the thermal world.
When you shake together beads of a few different sizes, they often unmix rather
than mix. Often the bigger ones migrate to the free surface. Once there, it is
hard for them to fall back down, because the space below is filled by smaller
beads. Or vibrate a box full of a dozen layers of beads, and at the right range
and rate of vibration, the wave-marked surface layer is decorated by little
standing jets of beads in regular array. There grains rise up and fall back with
a rhythm fixed by the vibration; each site alternates between a geyser a few
millimeters high and a little local crater.

<P>Frictional grain motions hug walls and only grudgingly spread. The inescapable
loss of energy on rebound induces neighboring grains to cluster after rather few
collisions. The unexpected order that the strange sandpiles show at our scale
comes from the external energy fed in to meet losses all but absent among real
atoms. Available energy is always capable of partial conversion into new order.
Just what that order will be may indeed have no single general answer. Surprises
will continue, as each rich new system sports its own wonders. (Try the unmixing
experiment in your own kitchen.)

<P>We owe the simplicities of mixing to quantum laws. They hold for granular
fountains and landslides, too, but when each rubbing grain holds a few thousand
trillion atoms to share collisional energy, atomic simplicity is long delayed.

<B>Urban Planning in Curitiba<BR>
</B><I>Jonas Rabinovitch and Josef Leitman</I><BR>
Smog, gridlock, overcrowding and blight sometimes seem like the inevitable
price of metropolitan growth, but a fast-rising city in southeastern Brazil
has found a better way. Simple technologies, creative use of resources,
and a public transportation system that is pleasant, efficient and affordable
have turned Curitiba into a model of what more cities could be.<BR>

Collisions with Comets and Asteroids<BR>
</B><I>Tom Gehrels<BR>
</I>Small rocky or icy bodies, left over from the formation of the planets,
normally follow distant, stable orbits, but rare mischance can send one
hurtling into the inner solar system. A leader of the Spacewatch team that
tracks near-earth comets and asteroids describes their awesome beauty, the
odds of a collision with our world and what could be done to prevent a cataclysm.<BR>

<B>The African AIDS Epidemic<BR>
</B><I>John C. Caldwell and Pat Caldwell</I><BR>
The scourge of AIDS falls hard on sub-Saharan Africa. Half of all cases
are found within a chain of countries home to just 2 percent of the world's
population. Unlike the scenario in most regions, here the virus causing
the disease spreads almost entirely through heterosexual intercourse. Only
one factor seems to correlate with the exceptionally high susceptibility:
lack of male circumcision.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Budding Vesicles in Cells<BR>
</B><I>James E. Rothman and Lelio Orci</I><BR>
Inside a cell, bundles of proteins and other molecules traffic from one
compartment to another inside membrane bubbles, or vesicles. How these vesicles
emerge as needed from one set of intracellular organs and deliver their
payload at the right destination has been an intensively studied biological
mystery. A transatlantic collaboration between the authors has helped to
find answers.<BR>

The Art and Science of Imagery Interpretation<BR>
<I>Dino A. Brugioni</I><BR>
Photoreconnaissance by spy planes and satellites has pulled the superpowers
back from the brink of war several times. A former image analyst for the
C.I.A. shares tricks of the trade and recently declassified pictures that
made history.<BR>

<B>Electrons in Flatland<BR>
</B><I>Steven Kivelson, Dung-Hai Lee and Shou-Cheng Zhang</I> <BR>
When moving electrons are trapped in the flat space between semiconductors
and exposed to a magnetic field, they exhibit an unusual behavior called
the quantum Hall effect. In essence, the electrons form a distinct phase
of matter. Explanations for the changes may be linked to mechanisms of superconductivity.<BR>

<B>Caribbean Mangrove Swamps<BR>
</B><I>Klaus R&uuml;tzler and Ilka C. Feller</I><BR>
Mangroves are trees adapted for life in shallow water along the ocean's
tropical shores; communities of organisms reside in and around them, creating
a habitat reminiscent of both a forest and a coral reef. The authors, a
marine biologist and a forest ecologist, guide us through one such mangrove
swamp in Belize.<BR>

<B>How Malnutrition Affects Intellectual Development</B><BR>
<I>J. Larry Brown and Ernesto Pollitt</I><BR>

Lack of essential nutrients during a child's early development can stunt mental development for a lifetime. Researchers had once assumed that this impairment resulted directly from irreversible brain damage, but now the mechanism appears more complex. The important finding is that a more enriched diet and educational environment may often be able to restore some lost cognitive skills.<P>


<B>The Global Positioning System</B><BR>
<I>Thomas A. Herring</I><BR>

Two dozen satellites hovering thousands of miles up can locate your position on the earth's surface to within a few centimeters. Originally constructed for military applications, this network of space beacons today finds civilian applications--such as landing airplanes in fog--that demand accuracy beyond what its designers had thought would be technically possible.<P>

<B>Seeing Underwater with Background Sound</B><BR>
<I>Michael J. Buckingham, John R. Potter and Chad L. Epifanio</I><BR>

The crash of waves, the patter of rain, the thrum of ships' engines and other activities fill the oceans with ambient sound, much as the sun fills our sky with light. Using a variation on sonar technologies, it is now possible to visualize objects underwater by seeing how they interact with this "acoustic daylight." A prototype system has already been tested with the help of killer whales.<P>


<B>Telomeres, Telomerase and Cancer</B><BR>
<I>Carol W. Greider and Elizabeth H. Blackburn</I><BR>

Time whittles away away at us, in literal truth: in much of the human body, those precious bundles of DNA called chromosomes become fractionally shorter with every cell division. Tumor cells, though, are immortal, seemingly because an enzyme called telomerase rebuilds the shrinking ends of the chromosomes. New research is focusing on telomerase as a possible target for anticancer therapies.<P>

<B>Colossal Explosions in Nearby Galaxies</B><BR>
<I>Sylvain Veilleux , Gerald Cecil and Jonathan Bland-Hawthorn</I><BR>

The centers of some galaxies glow with a light that outshines the entire Milky Way. Black holes a billion times more massive than our sun may power most of them; others draw their energy from a rapid pulse of stellar evolution that creates millions of hot stars in a small volume of space. By strewing space with heavy elements, these active galaxies may shape the evolution of the universe.<P>

<B>The Bacteria behind Ulcers</B><BR>
<I>Martin J. Blaser</I><BR>

Not spicy foods or nervous dispositions but acid-loving microbes are the culprits in most cases of stomach ulcers. They seem to be linked to stomach cancer as well. At least a third of all people carry these bacteria, yet only a small number ever become sick. Discover why that may be and what the newest treatments are.<P>


<B>The Loves of the Plants</B><BR>
<I>Londa Shiebinger</I><BR>

When the great taxonomist Linnaeus looked at a flower bed, he saw a veritable orgy of botanical lust. By choosing to classify plants on the basis of their flowers' reproductive organs, he imposed 18th-century assumptions on the interpretation of nature--and found a natural "validation" of contemporary sexual values.<P>

<I>Donald H. Weingarten </I><BR>

The theory of quantum chromodynamics (QCD, for short) explains the behavior of matter well, but it was one drawback: its mathematics is too complicated for exact predictions. At least, it used to be--until the author helped to build a computer that tamed the ferocious calculations at the heart of fundamental physics.<P>

</B><I>Phil Williams and Paul N. Woessner</I><BR>
The amount of plutonium needed to build a nuclear weapon could fit inside
two soft drink cans. Much less is needed for other deadly acts of terrorism.
Those facts, coupled with the huge, poorly supervised nuclear stockpiles
in Russia and elsewhere, make the danger of a black market in radioactive
materials all too real. Yet disturbingly little is being done to contain
this menace.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Caloric Restriction and Aging<BR>
</B><I>Richard Weindruch</I><BR>
Want to live longer? Eating fewer calories might help. Although the case
for humans is still being studied, organisms ranging from single cells to
mammals survive consistently longer when fed a well-balanced but spartanly
lo-cal diet. Good news for snackers: understanding the biochemistry of this
benefit may lead to a solution that extends longevity without hunger.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Technology and Economics in the Semiconductor Industry<BR>
</B><I>G. Dan Hutcheson and Jerry Hutcheson</I><BR>
Semiconductor Cassandras have repeatedly warned that chipmakers were approaching
a barrier to further improvements; every time, ingenuity pushed back the
wall. With the cost of building a factory climbing into the billions, a
true slow-down may yet be inescapable. <BR>
Even so, the industry can still grow vigorously by working to make microchips
that are more diverse, rather than just faster.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Neural Networks in Vertebrate Locomotion<BR>
</B><I>Sten Grillner</I><BR>
How does the brain coordinate all the muscle movements involved in walking,
running and swimming? It doesn't-some of the control is delegated to local
systems of neurons in the spinal cord. Working with primitive fish called
lampreys, investigators have identified some of this circuitry. These discoveries
raise the prospects for eventually being able to restore mobility to some
accident victims.<BR>

<B>Cleaning Up the River Rhine<BR>
</B><I>Karl-Geert Malle</I><BR>
The Rhine is Europe's most economically important river: 20 percent of its
water is diverted for human purposes, and it is a vital artery for shipping
and power. Twenty years ago, pollution had threatened to ruin both the Rhine's
beauty and its utility. International cooperation, however, has now brought
many troublesome sources of chemical contamination under control.<BR>

<B>The Evolution of Continental Crust<BR>
</B><I>S. Ross Taylor and Scott M. McLennan</I><BR>
The continents not only rise above the level of the seas, they float atop
far denser rocks below. Of all the worlds in the solar system, only our
own has sustained enough geologic activity through the constant movement
of its tectonic plates to create such huge, stable land masses.<BR>

<P>In the 1920s <a href="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap960217.html">Edwin Hubble</a> 
definitively proved that the star-studded "nebulae" scattered across the sky are in fact other galaxies, 
island universes similar to our own Milky Way. Ever since, astronomers have embarked on the grandest 
kind of cartography: an attempt to map ever larger swaths of the cosmos and to make sense of the patterns 
that appear. And indeed, patterns seem to be everywhere: observers have reported seeing galaxies 
gathered into vast filaments and "Great Walls," bubbles and voids. Explaining the origin of such large-
scale structures (which are not readily accounted for in the simplest versions of the <a 
href="http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/guidry/violence/bang.html">big bang</a>) has been a prime task for 
cosmologists of late. But could the prevalence of pattern lie primarily in the eye of the beholder?  

<P>Astrology columns and the elaborate mythological images connected with the constellations bear 
witness to our primordial compulsion to impute deep meanings to the arrangement of shiny things in the 
sky. One way to understand this human trait is in terms of a mathematical concept called Ramsey theory. 
Proposed by the British mathematician <a href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-
and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Ramsey.html">Frank P. Ramsey</a> more than 70 years ago, it 
postulates that one can find polygons or other regular structures even among the most random collection 
of points. The late <a href="http://www.sciam.com/explorations/010697sagan/010697explorations.html">Carl Sagan</a>,
 in his recent book <I>Demon-Haunted World</I>, expressed this notion in more direct terms. "Even a 
succession of professional scientists...can make serious, even profound errors in pattern recognition," he 
wrote.

<P>Modern cosmologists, too, may be susceptible to Ramsey effects, although they are searching not for 
divine omens but for clues about our cosmic origins. Astronomers once believed, largely for reasons of 
convenience and simplicity, that galaxies were scattered more or less evenly throughout the universe. 
Observers knew that galaxies often are found grouped in clusters, but they expected that, over very large 
scales, the distribution of galaxies would appear to smooth out. Over the past decade or so, however, that 
belief has been challenged as telescopes have plumbed increasingly broad and deep regions of space.


<P>In the mid-1980s a number of astronomers reported that <a href="http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/cfa/oir/Research/structure.html">galaxies seemed to bunch together</a>
 into "filaments" or "sheets" or "bubbles" separated by gigantic voids. In 1989 a group led by John P. Huchra and 
<a href="http://cannon.sfsu.edu/Physics_public_html/gmarcy/cswa/cswa/history/geller.html">
Margaret J. Geller</a> at the <a href="http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/">Harvard-Smithsonian Center for 
Astrophysics</a> claimed to have found a <a href="http://chico.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Cyberia/Cosmos/WallsVoids.html#SheetsVoids">Great Wall</a> of 
galaxies some 500 million light-years across. Another team led by Tom Broadhurst at the 
<a href="http://physics7.berkeley.edu/dir/directory.html">University of California at Berkeley</a> 
announced that its probes of two "pencil beams" of space--narrow but deep surveys extending several 
billion light-years distant--had turned up regions dense with galaxies alternating with comparatively 
empty voids; the voids appeared to measure some 400 million light-years across. Every time astronomers 
have managed to expand the scale on which they observe the universe, the size of the largest ordered 
structures has increased as well.
	
<P><a href="HTTP://pupgg.princeton.edu/~gphysics/research/Peebles_P_J_E.html">P. James E. 
Peebles</a> of Princeton University, a dean of modern cosmology, has been one of the leading critics of 
this trend. He is fond of suggesting, tongue only slightly in cheek, that the human propensity to 
overinterpret data probably has a genetic basis, because our ancestors were more likely to survive if they 
occasionally mistook a bush for a leopard than the other way around. (Sagan notes that one of the giant 
galaxy clusterings, sometimes dubbed "the Stickman," resembles a stick figure--a clear instance of the 
eye's tendency to find familiar forms.)

<P>Peebles has expressed doubts about the significance of the Great Wall, the pencil-beam observations 
and other allegations of large-scale structures. But now even Peebles is beginning to waver: as more and 
more similar reports accumulate, he is coming to suspect that the leopard might in fact be real. "I have to 
back down on my previous skepticism," he says.
	
<P>The latest word on large-scale cosmic structure comes from an international team led by two Estonian 
astrophysicists, <a href="http://www.aai.ee/~einasto/je.html">Jaan</a> and <a 
href="http://www.aai.ee/~maret/maret.html">Maret Einasto</a>, at the Tartu Observatory in Estonia. 
Together with eight colleagues, they integrated results from 300 previously published reports on galaxy 
distributions into a single, three-dimensional map. Their map includes 869 galaxy clusters--each 
containing hundreds or even thousands of galaxies--spanning a cube of space nearly two billion light-
years across (the entire visible universe extends only 10 to 15 billion light-years from the earth).
	
<P><a href="http://www.nature.com/Nature2/serve?SID=81406891&CAT=Corner&PG=Update/update172.html">
Einasto's group finds</a> that the map exhibits a distinct pattern. The clusters of galaxies tend to bunch 
together into "superclusters" spaced roughly 400 million light-years apart. "The whole distribution
resembles a three-dimensional chessboard," the team remarks in a 
<a href="http://www.aai.ee/~einasto/nature.html">paper</a> in the January 9 issue of 
<a href="http://www.nature.com/"><I>Nature</I></a>.
	
<P>The findings represent "the latest of a number of clues, none very compelling by itself, that hint at the 
presence of structure in the universe" on a very large scale, notes Robert Kirshner of Harvard's <a href="http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/hco/astron.html">Center for Astrophysics</a>. The existence of such 
large-scale structure would pose an acute problem for theorists, because observations of the microwave 
afterglow of the big bang indicate that the universe was rather homogeneous in its infancy. But the huge 
galaxy patterns seem to testify to the subsequent emergence of lumpiness.

	
<P>Kirshner notes that "new physics" may be required to explain how the universe could have been 
transformed from "soup to chowder" so rapidly. Theorists, never at a loss for novel ideas, have already 
proposed schemes involving such exotica as fluctuations in the strength of gravity during the universe's 
birth.
	
<P>Even the authors of the <I>Nature</I> paper concede that their interpretation of the galaxy data 
entails a number of uncertainties. Several newly conceived galaxy-mapping projects of unprecedented 
scope, such as the upcoming <a href="http://www.astro.princeton.edu/GBOOK/">Sloan Digital Sky 
Survey</a> spearheaded by James E. Gunn of Princeton University and <a href="http://www-astronomy.mps.ohio-state.edu/~dhw/index.html">David H. Weinberg</a> of Ohio State University may 
reduce those uncertainties (though they are sure to raise others). Until then, cosmologists will have to 
wonder whether they are seeing a real leopard in the sky or just the Ramsey effects of staring at too many 
spots. <p>

The ancients imagined thunderstorms and lightning to be evidence of titanic
war among the gods in the sky above. The truth, it turns out, is even odder and
more interesting than such myths. Peek above the black anvil clouds of large
storms, as droves of scientists have been doing in recent years, and (with the
right equipment) one can indeed find wonders: not gods, but exotic stabs of
illumination called sprites and elves. Geophysicists are now scrambling to
explain what causes these phenomena and how they may affect the earth's
atmosphere.

<table cellpadding=1 align=right width=137 ><tr><td><A

<P>For more than a century, sky watchers have reported seeing strange flickers of
lightninglike emissions shooting upward from cloudtops, but such sightings proved
<a href="http://elf.gi.alaska.edu/#why">extremely hard to verify</a>. Researchers
finally caught these events on videotape in 1989, and <a
href="http://wwwghcc.msfc.nasa.gov/skeets.html">space shuttle astronauts</a>
orbiting the earth got a <a
href="http://wwwghcc.msfc.nasa.gov/images/redSprite.gif">clear, if distant,
view</a> from above of these extraordinarily brief flashes, playfully named
sprites.

<P>But it wasn't until 1994 that <a
href="http://elf.gi.alaska.edu/sprite_pages/personnel.html">a team out of the
University of Alaska at Fairbanks</a>, circling around midwestern thunderstorms
in a jet aircraft, obtained the <a
href="http://elf.gi.alaska.edu/papers/redsprites.html">first color images</a> of
sprites. <a href="http://elf.gi.alaska.edu/">These snapshots show</a> that
sprites are colorful (usually red), quite enormous and often surprisingly
delicate in form. Some sprites stretch upward 95 kilometers (58 miles) from the
cloudtops. They always seem to appear just as a lightning bolt--usually an
especially fierce one--strikes down toward earth, and they almost always appear
in groups.

<P>Investigators now think sprites probably occur when an unusually potent stroke
of lightning creates an intense electrostatic field above the cloud from which it
emanates. Ions (electrically charged atoms) and electrons floating about the
atmosphere are heated by this field and <a
href="http://www-star.stanford.edu/~vlf/Red_Sprite/Red_Sprite.html">glow red in
response</a>, scientists speculate. <a
href="http://www.gi.alaska.edu/~heavner/rs/bluejets.html">Blue jets may be
formed</a> when such conditions happen to occur just as a <a
href="http://www.physics.adelaide.edu.au/astrophysics/cr.html">cosmic ray</a> (an
extremely fast moving particle kicked out of a supernova or some other energetic
cosmic event) collides with an air molecule in that region. The collision
produces a shower of fast electrons; the upward-pointing electrostatic field
above the cloud can accelerate these electrons further, to energies at which they
emit blue light.

<P>When researchers pointed their cameras to pick up sprites, they were surprised
to discover that other bizarre light shows also illuminate the high altitudes.
Vast blue jets, rising from clouds at 300 times the speed of sound in air, form
cones of light that stand 40 kilometers tall. Then in mid-December a group of
Stanford University researchers, led by <a
href="http://www-star.stanford.edu/~vlf/umran.html">Umran Inan</a> of Stanford
University, reported at the <a
href="http://www.agu.org/meetings/fm96a.html#A72C">American Geophysical Union
meeting</a> in San Francisco that they had clocked yet another form of
stratospheric lightning, one that, paradoxical though it may seem, propagates
faster than the speed of light. These halos of red light, dubbed elves, were
first conclusively recorded by Japanese scientists in 1995. But little was known
about their structure and movement until Inan's group imaged the phenomenon with
The <a href="http://www-star.stanford.edu/~vlf/fly/">Fly's Eye</a>--a
custom-built instrument that chains together 12 highly sensitive photodetectors,
each in its own 45-centimeter (18-inch) barrel and each pointing to a different
part of the sky.

<P>The <a href="http://www-star.stanford.edu/~vlf/">Stanford researchers</a>
managed to get a good look at 10 elves. All started just above a groundstroke of
normal lightning but expanded into rings up to 300 kilometers (200 miles) across
in less than a thousandth of a second. Although the elves appear to spread faster
than light, analysis of the physics behind elves demonstrates that no particles
actually move that fast, so Einsteinian relativity is not violated. The
faster-than-light illusion seems to be caused by successively distant air
molecules lighting up in rapid-fire sequence, like the strobe lights running
along an airport runway.

<P>Inan and Yuri Taranenko of <a href="http://www.lanl.gov/">Los Alamos National
Laboratory</a> have developed mathematical models which they think may explain
what causes elves. According to their simulation, the key is the electromagnetic
pulse produced by lightning strokes. This pulse expands like a balloon, upward
and away from the groundstroke. If the pulse is strong enough, the theory goes,
it energizes the ions and free electrons at the border between the stratosphere
and ionosphere enough to make the charged particles shine red.

<P>So, although the electromagnetic pulse expands at exactly the speed of light,
Inan explains, the ring of shining particles formed at the lower edge of the
ionosphere grows faster--just as a balloon released underwater will, as it breaks
the surface, create a ripple that moves much faster outward than the rate at
which the balloon rises upward. Zeus himself might be impressed.

The death of <A
HREF="http://www.news.cornell.edu/general/Dec96/saganobit.ltb.html">Carl
Sagan</A> on December 20, 1996, robbed the science world of one of its most
creative researchers and articulate spokesmen. At the time of his death, Sagan
was <A HREF="http://astrosun.tn.cornell.edu/faculty/sagan/sagan.html">David
Duncan Professor of Astronomy and Space Sciences</A> and director of the
Laboratory for Planetary Studies at <A
HREF="http://astrosun.tn.cornell.edu/Home.html">Cornell University</A>, where he
had held a professorship since 1971.

<P>Sagan was an avid proponent of space exploration who <A
HREF="http://windows.ivv.nasa.gov/people/today/sagan.html">contributed to most of
the unmanned missions</A> that explored our solar system. These included the <A
HREF="http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/database/www-nmc?71-051A">Mariner 9</A>
spacecraft, which produced the first detailed images showing that <A
HREF="http://cmex-www.arc.nasa.gov/">Mars</A> is currently a desolate, cratered
world; the <A HREF="http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/viking.html">Viking
orbiters and landers</A>, which <A
HREF="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap950721.html">searched (unsuccessfully)
for life</A> on the surface of the Red Planet; the <A
HREF="http://pyroeis.arc.nasa.gov/pioneer/PNhome.html">Pioneer</A> and <A
HREF="http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/voyager.html">Voyager</A> probes that
provided the first surveys of the outer planets and their moons; and the <A
HREF="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/galileo/">Galileo</A> craft, which is currently
sending back extremely detailed images of <A
HREF="http://128.165.1.1/solarsys/jupiter.htm">Jupiter</A> and its giant
satellites.

<P>Sagan's work transformed our understanding of Earth's place in the cosmos. He
helped to determine that the surface of <A
HREF="http://bang.lanl.gov/solarsys/venus.htm">Venus</A>--once considered a
possibly hospitable place--is hellishly hot, fried by a greenhouse effect run
amok. Yet he also showed that the universe abounds with intricate, carbon-based
chemicals that could be the precursors of other living things. And Sagan
collected evidence that <A
HREF="http://bang.lanl.gov/solarsys/saturn.htm">Saturn</A>'s moon <A
HREF="http://bang.lanl.gov/solarsys/titan.htm">Titan</A> has an atmosphere
containing organic molecules similar to the building blocks of life. That work
was stunningly confirmed by Voyagers 1 and 2 in the 1980s.

<P>Throughout his career, Sagan argued for the importance of searching for signs
of <A
HREF="http://lsnt7.lightspeed.net/astronomy/lifezones/lifezones.html">extraterrestrial
life</A>. At Cornell, he pioneered the new field of <A
HREF="http://stellar.arc.nasa.gov/EXPLORATIONS/FRONTIERS/exobiol.html">exobiology</A>--the
study of possible alien biochemistry and life forms. He conceived a <A
HREF="http://www.enterprisemission.com/pioneer.html">message plaque</A>,
containing a greeting from the people of Earth, which adorns the <A
HREF="http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/database/www-nmc?72-012A">Pioneer 10</A>
spacecraft, now headed into interstellar space (a more sophisticated, engraved <A
HREF="http://vraptor.jpl.nasa.gov/voyager/record.html">phonograph record</A>
adorned <A HREF="http://vraptor.jpl.nasa.gov/voyager/voyager.html">the two
Voyager craft</A>, also on their way to the stars). Along with various
collaborators, including <A HREF="http://mc.harvard.edu/seti/">Paul Horowitz</A>
of Harvard University, Sagan supported projects that use <A
HREF="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap960309.html">radio telescopes</A> to
listen for signals from <A HREF="http://www.seti-inst.edu/">possible intelligent
alien civilizations</A>.

<P>But perhaps Sagan's greatest skill was his ability to communicate with
individuals here on Earth. Through a series of books, magazine articles and
television shows, he reached beyond the scientific community to convey the
excitement of his research to the lay public. (His writing graced the pages of
<I>Scientific American</I>; three of his articles are available from this page.)
Sagan's concerns ranged far and wide, from the effects of nuclear war to the
evolution of the mind to the <A HREF="http://www.csicop.org/">intellectual
erosion brought about by pseudoscience</A> (the subject of his most recent book,
<I>The Demon-Haunted World</I>). His television series <A
HREF="http://bornova.ege.edu.tr/~lyurga/sagan/episodes.html"><I>Cosmos</I></A>
reached an estimated audience of 500 million people; his novel <I>Contact</I> is
being made into a movie that will be released later this year. Sagan also
co-founded <A HREF="http://planetary.org/tps/">the Planetary Society</A>, the
largest space-interest group in the world.

<P>My own interaction with Carl Sagan began on the printed page, when I read his
electrifying first book, <I>The Cosmic Connection</I>, published in 1973. Sagan's
prose was utterly unlike the rote descriptions of the planets (complete with
tables listing mass, density, period of rotation and so on) that I had read in
various astronomy books for young readers. In a chapter entitled "The Moons of
Barsoom," he weaves together the science-fiction lore of <A
HREF="http://wwwvms.utexas.edu/~mrapp/sagan/Edgar.html">Edgar Rice Burroughs</A>
with his on-the-scene descriptions of Mariner 9's first images of Mars's two tiny
satellites, <A HREF="http://bang.lanl.gov/solarsys/phobos.htm">Phobos</A> and <A
HREF="http://bang.lanl.gov/solarsys/deimos.htm">Deimos</A>. These enigmatic lumps
of rock, the subject of years of curious speculation, turned out to resemble
horribly pockmarked potatoes. They are so tiny, Sagan explains, that an astronaut
standing on their surfaces could easily pitch a baseball into orbit (Phobos, the
larger of the two, is just 14 kilometers in its longest dimension). What an image
to a curious youth--baseball on the moons of Mars!

<P>In another chapter, Sagan speculates on the likelihood that other planetary
systems contain worlds that support life. He includes an illustration depicting
five "model solar systems" created by a <A
HREF="http://web.netusa1.net/~ksagars/planetformation.html">computer
simulation</A> designed by Stephen Dole, then at <A
HREF="http://www.rand.org/">Rand Corporation</A>. I could not pry my eyes from
those simple, schematic drawings. Again and again, I tried to visualize what
those imaginary worlds would look like, to choose which of these planets might
have breathable atmospheres and balmy temperatures. The rapid discovery of <A
HREF="http://www.sciam.com/explorations/052796explorations.html">planets around
sunlike stars</A>, starting late in 1995, offered the first example of what other
planetary systems look like. That these systems exist at all affirms Sagan's
belief that planets are commonplace throughout our galaxy; that they look
immensely unlike the ones created by Dole's model underscores how greatly the
creativity of Nature outstrips that of the human imagination. I am glad that
Sagan lived to witness these stunning detections.

<P>Later, as an editor at <I>Scientific American</I>, I had various occasions to
meet Sagan, even to work with him. I was amazed that, despite the tremendous
energies he devoted to his popular writing and <A
HREF="http://www.cornell.edu/Academic/Courses96/csas/as300.html">teaching</A>, he
continued to be an active researcher as well. He never lost enthusiasm for his
investigations into the remarkable prevalence of organic chemicals or for his
quest for signals from alien civilizations. It did not matter that such signals
have not yet been found; Sagan delighted in grasping at tasks and concepts that
lie far beyond the grasp of science. In that vein, the final chapters of <I>The
Cosmic Connection</I> contain his reflections on what extraterrestrial
intelligences might be like and how they might communicate. Sagan's words are
both inspiring and humbling:

<P>"We are like the inhabitants of an isolated valley in New Guinea who
communicate with societies in neighboring valleys (quite different societies, I
might add) by runner and by drum. When asked how a very advanced society will
communicate, they might guess by an extremely rapid runner or by an improbably
large drum. They might not guess a technology beyond their ken. And yet, all the
while, a vast international cable and radio traffic passes over them, around
them, and through them...

<P>"We will listen for the interstellar drums, but we will miss the interstellar
cables. We are likely to receive our first messages from the drummers of the
neighboring galactic valleys--from civilizations only somewhat in our future. The
civilizations vastly more advanced than we, will be, for a long time, remote both
in distance and in accessibility. At a future time of vigorous interstellar radio
traffic, the very advanced civilizations may be, for us, still insubstantial
legends."

<CENTER><BR><H1>Rethinking<br>the Speedy World</H1>

<H3>An International Conference Dares to Ask,<br>
'Is It Time for the World to Slow Down?'</H3></CENTER><P>

"Speed is good." That simple statement has been a guiding philosophy of Western
technological development at least since the time of the Industrial Revolution.
Certainly it is a central tenet of the current computer revolution, and the
mantra of many a user anxious to zip around the World Wide Web. But does speed
really make our life better? Should our society be examining new paths to
development that do not force our lives to run faster and faster?<P>

<table cellpadding=1 align=right width=137 ><tr><td><IMG

BORDER="1"><br clear=all><P><FONT SIZE=2><B>John Thackera,</B> director of the <A
HREF="http://www.design-inst.nl/">Netherlands Design Institute,</A> organized a
conference that was billed "more as a play than a lecture."</FONT></td> </tr></table><P>

Those unorthodox questions were raised recently at <A
HREF="http://www.design-inst.nl/doors/doors4/aboutframe.html">Doors of Perception
4</A>, the latest in a <A
HREF="http://www.design-inst.nl/doors/doorsallframe.html"> series of
interdisciplinary conferences</A> organized by the <A
HREF="http://www.design-inst.nl/"> Netherlands Design Institute</A> in Amsterdam.
Speakers included such luminaries as <A
HREF="http://www.hip.atr.co.jp/~ray/tierra/whatis.html">artificial-life</A> guru
<A HREF="http://www.hip.atr.co.jp/~ray/">Tom Ray</A> and architect <A
HREF="http://www.design-inst.nl/doors/doors4/bios/koolhaas.html">Rem
Koolhaas</A>, as well as a diverse collection of artists, technologists,
demographers and historians. Over two days and more than 45 presentations, the
participants debated the meaning of speed, the merits of speed and the
possibilities of controlling it.<P>

<A HREF="http://www.design-inst.nl/who/thackara/index.html">John Thackara</A>,
the director of the Netherlands Design Institute and organizer of Doors of
Perception, wisely cautioned that the conference would function "more as a play
than a lecture"--an approach that generated more than a little confusion but also
an abundance of creative comment.<P>

Much of "Doors 4" focused on the ways that speed is manifested in Europe and the
U.S. <A HREF="http://www.voyagerco.com/catalog/osc/indepth/prelarch.html">Rick
Prelinger</A>, a film archivist, focused on the most familiar aspects, the role
of speed in Western industrialization. He introduced a series of clips from
corporate movies celebrating the breakneck pace of the industrial age (these are
available on a series of CD-ROMs called "<A
HREF="http://www.voyagerco.com/catalog/osc/indepth/">Our Secret Century</A>"). A
1937 Chevrolet film proudly showing its workers as roboticized automatons
provoked uncomfortable laughter from the audience. <A
HREF="http://www.design-inst.nl/doors/doors4/bios/adams.html">John Adams</A> of
University College London cited one of the central paradoxes of industrial
development: as access to cars increases, so do the problems of congestion and
urban sprawl. The result is what he calls "fast lives with low resolution." And
<A HREF="http://judith.www.media.mit.edu/Judith/">Judith Donath</A> of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology wittily pointed out that even the <A
HREF="http://www.design-inst.nl/doors/doors4/transcripts/donath.html">rate of
fashion</A> has steadily accelerated along with social mobility and information
flow in the West.<P>

But as several speakers observed, issues of speed are often more acutely seen in
the non-Western world, where access is generally more limited but change can be
even more abrupt. In a dour but eye-opening presentation, Koolhaas described how
swift economic and population growth in China has created a kind of runaway
architecture. Buildings are redesigned even as they are completed; cities and
airports are being constructed for populations that have not yet arrived; and
China's architects, responding to this pressure, have achieved a pace and
efficiency of design utterly unknown in the West. Ray <A
HREF="http://www.design-inst.nl/doors/doors4/transcripts/ray.html">talked</A>
about the difficulty of establishing long-term protection of the natural habitat
in Costa Rica, where he has worked as a conservation ecologist. Producer <A
HREF="http://www.design-inst.nl/doors/doors4/bios/ota.html">Kayoko Ota</A> and
writer <A HREF="http://www.design-inst.nl/doors/doors4/bios/heilly.html">David
d'Heilly</A> reflected that catch-up industrialization in Asia is favoring the
promotion of consumer rights over civil rights--in Singapore, for example.<P>

Not all was doom and gloom, however. Several participants, especially those from
the developing world, moved to disperse the air of pessimism about the perils of
an ever-faster world. <A
HREF="http://www.design-inst.nl/doors/doors4/bios/sundaram.html">Ravi
Sundaram</A> of the Center for the Study of Developing Societies in Delhi, India,
eloquently defended modern telecommunications (the Web in particular) from a
Muslim point of view; he praised the emergence of a "cyber-public realm," a new
kind of community that obliterates political boundaries. <A
HREF="http://www.design-inst.nl/doors/doors4/bios/pitroda.html">Sam Pitroda</A>,
a former vice president at Rockwell International and chairman of the Telecom
Commission of India, spoke in a more down-to-earth vein. He noted that in
countries like India, information technology is not just a luxury. It is vital to
basic activities like bringing food to market and preventing drought; it is also
a major source of new jobs and wealth.<P>

The wildly diverse viewpoints at the Doors conference came into sharp relief
again as speakers asked what--if anything--should be done to control the speed of
our society. <A
HREF="http://www.design-inst.nl/doors/doors4/bios/sachs.html">Wolfgang Sachs</A>,
project director at the Wuppertal Institute for Climate, Energy and the
Environment in Wuppertal, Germany, took <A
HREF="http://www.design-inst.nl/doors/doors4/transcripts/sachs.html">the European
Green position</A>. He argued that the fast life is environmentally unsustainable
and so must be decelerated--for instance, governments might regulate the top
speed of autos and trains. <A
HREF="http://www.design-inst.nl/doors/doors4/bios/ross.html">Andrew Ross</A> of
New York University formulated a <A
HREF="http://www.design-inst.nl/doors/doors4/transcripts/ross.html">liberal
critique of speed</A>, urging designers to think about how to utilize technology
to create new jobs, not to displace labor; he did not indicate whether such a
goal could or should be forcibly achieved. <A
HREF="http://www.design-inst.nl/doors/doors4/bios/cramer.html">Jacqueline
Cramer</A> of Phillips Consumer Electronics offered <A
HREF="http://www.design-inst.nl/doors/doors4/transcripts/cramer.html">a mild,
industrial solution</A>: design products with greater durability to combat our
resource-intensive, disposable culture. On the far radical fringe, artist <A
HREF="http://www.design-inst.nl/doors/doors4/bios/gaignebet.html">Claude
Gaignebet</A> of the University of Nice recalled the French riots of 1968 and
declared that the time had come for people to rise up, "stop and decide you are
free!"<P>

Others urged, far more calmly, that technology be reshaped so that it follows
art, storytelling or the rhythm of biological life. The specific examples were
largely unconvincing, however. A <A
HREF="http://www.design-inst.nl/doors/doors4/transcripts/bakker.html">"virtual
airport" project</A> commissioned by Japan Airlines produced three competing
proposals for how to use Web-like interactivity to make airline travel more
pleasant--each was more <A
HREF="http://www.design-inst.nl/doors/doors4/transcripts/klinkowstein.html">jarring</A>
than <A
HREF="http://www.design-inst.nl/doors/doors4/transcripts/nagasawa.html">the one
before</A>. Possibly the most bizarre proposal came from <A
HREF="http://www.design-inst.nl/doors/doors4/bios/hillis.html">Danny Hillis</A>,
a founder of Thinking Machines. He outlined his half-serious idea for a "<A
HREF="http://www.hotwired.com/club/special/transcripts/95-12-06.hillis.html">millennium
clock</A>," built in some secluded area, that would tick once per year and chime
once per millennium in order to stretch our perspective of time.<P>

One option, of course, is simply not to choose speed. <A
HREF="http://www.design-inst.nl/doors/doors4/bios/schor.html">Juliet Schor</A> of
Tilburg University <A
HREF="http://www.design-inst.nl/doors/doors4/transcripts/schor.html">reported</A>
that many people seem to be doing just that. Her research shows that more than
one quarter of all Americans say they have made choices in the past five years
that reduced their income in return for increased leisure time. <A
HREF="http://www.design-inst.nl/doors/doors4/bios/morton.html">Oliver Morton</A>,
the editor-in-chief of <A HREF="http://www.wired.com/"><I>Wired UK</I></A>, dryly
noted that the proponents of a slower world were mostly those who had already had
a chance to taste as much speed as they desired. Indeed, the developing-world
presenters mostly endorsed information technology as both culturally and
economically enriching.<P>

The lack of firm conclusions was not at all surprising; "Doors 4" was conceived
from the start as a place to raise questions, not to arrive at final solutions.
Even so, the prevailing mood was a striking one of fascinated impotence: the
elite thinkers at the conference recognized their very limited power to do
anything more than register and report on the steady acceleration of life. As <A
HREF="http://www.design-inst.nl/who/kerckhove/index.html">Derrick de
Kerckhove</A> of the University of Toronto concluded, "All we can hope for is
that it turns out to be calming, not explosive."<P>

<P><A
HREF="http://www.nrel.gov/business/international/info-energy/supplies/fossil/fuel-cell.html">Fuel
cells</A> sound like a science-fiction fantasy: an efficient,
nonpolluting power source that produces no noise and has no
moving parts. But such cells not only exist, they have been
providing electricity on <A
HREF="http://www.lerc.nasa.gov/Other_Groups/PAO/html/apollew.htm#cell">spacecraft</A>
since the 1960s. In more down-to-earth applications, they could
be used as <A
HREF="http://www.metc.doe.gov/research/power/fc_advan.html">electricity-generating
plants</A> or as a power source for nearly exhaust-free
automobiles. The main sticking point is the high cost of
manufacturing the devices, which has largely limited them to a
handful of exotic applications. Now falling prices and new
technologies suggest that the fuel cell's day may finally have
arrived.

<P>In <A
HREF="http://www.metc.doe.gov/research/power/fc_syste.html">fuel
cells</A>, as in batteries, silent reactions produce an electric
current. Unlike batteries, however, fuel cells are almost
endlessly rechargeable. The cells run on <A
HREF="http://www.cen.uiuc.edu/~archer/energy/history.html">hydrogen</A>,
which reacts with oxygen from the air in such a way that a
voltage is generated between two electrodes; the reactions occur
in a chemical mediator known as an electrolyte. (Some designs
consume hydrogen directly; others start with natural gas that is
converted to hydrogen before entering the cell.) Compared with
conventional fossil-fuel power sources, fuel cells are
exceptionally clean and efficient. Practically their only waste
product is water; natural gas-fueled cells do produce some
carbon dioxide as well, though less than would be created if the
fuel were burned.

<P>Right now, <A
HREF="http://www.icgti.org/mplace/onsi/index.htm">ONSI
Corporation</A> in Windsor, Conn., a subsidiary of International
Fuel Cells, is the only <A
HREF="http://www.metc.doe.gov/projfact/power/fc/onsi.html">commercial
manufacturer of fuel cells</A>. Seventy-four of its units, each
the size of a minivan, are now in operation, often in locations
such as hospitals and remote hotels where grid power is
expensive and reliability is worth a premium. (An ONSI
installation in Groton, Conn., is consuming methane from a
landfill, thereby both generating power and siphoning off an
explosive waste gas; the U.S. Department of Energy is supporting
a <A
HREF="http://www.metc.doe.gov/projfact/power/fc/anoka.html">similar
project</A>.) Each cell provides 200 kilowatts of power; the
heat each produces can also be used to warm buildings, an
approach known as cogeneration. ONSI's marketing manager,
Gregory J. Sandelli, states that in 1.25 million hours of total
use, his company's cells have remained in operation 95 percent
of the time--a figure that bests on-site, diesel-powered
generators. The units, which use <A
HREF="http://www.i-way.co.uk/~ectechnic/FCTYPES.HTML#phos">phosphoric
acid</A> as an electrolyte, are designed to last 20 years.

<P>Phosphoric acid-based cells tend to be heavy, which makes them
less than ideal for use in vehicles. Other companies are
developing cells that are specifically designed for that
purpose. <A
HREF="http://eco-web.com/register/02207.html">Ballard Power
Systems</A> in Vancouver, B.C., has for several years been
developing a lightweight fuel cell, the "<A
HREF="http://www.i-way.co.uk/~ectechnic/ACIDFC.HTML">proton-exchange
membrane</A>" (PEM) type. In place of phosphoric acid, PEM cells
employ a thin polymer membrane as their electrolyte. By mid-1997
Ballard is planning to launch pilot fleets of a <A
HREF="http://solstice.crest.org/renewables/thl/dec94.html">fuel
cell-powered passenger</A> bus in <A
HREF="http://www.ttcorp.com/nha/advocate/ad11vanc.htm">Vancouver</A>
and Chicago. The U.S. Department of Transportation is also
developing fuel-cell buses.

<P>More exciting is the possibility of installing <A
HREF="http://www.nrel.gov/documents/electric_vehicles/ev93ch4.html">fuel
cells in automobiles</A>, where they potentially have
significant advantages over polluting internal-combustion
engines or power-poor batteries in electric vehicles such as
General Motors's new <A
HREF="http://www.gmev.com/evsite/ev1/index.htm">EV1</A>. Within
the past year, both <A
HREF="http://www.ttcorp.com/nha/advocate/ad13toyo.htm">Toyota</A>
and <A
HREF="http://www.daimlerbenz.com/spotlite/necar/necar_e.htm">Daimler-Benz</A>
(the latter has been collaborating with Ballard) have exhibited
PEM cell-powered automobiles. The main difficulty with using
fuel cells in passenger vehicles is in supplying the hydrogen.
Although the gas can be compressed, companies are worried about
safety should a pressurized hydrogen tank be damaged in an
accident (the public's memories of the Hindenberg do not help).
Toyota's demonstration car solved the problem by storing the
hydrogen in hydrides, compounds that can stockpile hydrogen in a
safe, but heavy and cumbersome, form. Toyota and Daimler-Benz
are also exploring a technique for producing the hydrogen as
needed by  breaking down a fuel such as methanol, which is far
easier to transport and pump into a car.

<P>When portability is not an issue, as it is not for municipal
utilities, other possibilities open up. "<A
HREF="http://www.metc.doe.gov/research/power/fc_mcfc.html">Molten
carbonate</A>" and "<A
HREF="http://www.metc.doe.gov/research/power/fc_sofc.html">solid
oxide</A>" fuel-cell technologies, for instance, could bring
extraordinary efficiencies to power-generating stations. These
devices run at far higher temperatures than PEM or phosphoric
acid cells. <A
HREF="http://www-pe.wbmt.tudelft.nl/ev/wei.html">Molten
carbonate</A> and solid oxide cells might be able to achieve an
impressive efficiency of 55 percent or more, according to Robert
R. Rose of <A HREF="http://www.fuelcells.org/">Fuel Cells 2000,</A>
an advocacy group. The hot steam and carbon dioxide they produce
can be used to drive a gas turbine that generates additional
electricity, an approach that could push their efficiency to an
unheard-of 80 percent. They are potentially up to twice as
efficient as a typical oil- or coal-fired plant.

<P><A HREF="http://www.ercc.com/">Energy Research Corporation</A>
(ERC) in Danbury, Conn., has built a two-megawatt pilot molten
carbonate plant for the municipality of Santa Clara, Calif. The
fuel cells run at about 650 degrees Celsius (1,200 Fahrenheit)
and consume hydrocarbon fuel that is <A
HREF="http://www.metc.doe.gov/research/power/fc_inter.html">re-formed
into hydrogen</A> right inside the cells. Problems with
electrical shorts within the cells have restricted the plant's
output so far to about one megawatt. As the ERC's William V.
Baker is at pains to point out, however, that still makes the
Santa Clara plant the highest-powered fuel cell unit in the U.S.
The company is currently developing a modified design rated at
2.85 megawatts.

<P>Critics of the molten carbonate technology note that such cells
use as electrolytes highly corrosive molten salts that
complicate design and maintenance. <A
HREF="http://www.stc.westinghouse.com/">Westinghouse</A> is
therefore <A
HREF="http://www.metc.doe.gov/projfact/power/fc/west_so.html">focusing
on the rival solid-oxide approach</A>. These cells, which employ
solid metal oxides as their electrolyte, operate at even higher
temperatures than molten carbonate, close to 1,000 degrees C
(1,800 F). Nevertheless, Christian A. Forbes, manager of
business development for solid-oxide fuel cells at Westinghouse,
states that some component cells have logged 69,000 hours
(almost eight years) of activity. Westinghouse's cells have an
open-ended <A
HREF="http://www.metc.doe.gov/research/power/fc_so2_g.html">tubular
design</A> that makes them look something like a church organ.
That approach minimizes sealing problems caused when materials
expand as the temperature rises. The company is now installing a
100-kilowatt test unit in the Netherlands. A second unit may
follow within a year, and a decision on whether to initiate
full-scale production is expected in 1999.

<P>Ceramatec of Utah is one of several companies developing solid-
oxide fuel cells in an alternative "planar" configuration that
incorporates stacks of disk-shaped electrodes. Planar designs
traditionally suffer from sealing problems, but Steven Visco and
his colleagues at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory think
they have identified <A
HREF="http://www.gri.org/pubs/techrep/march/ab95_0044.html">a
solution</A>. Visco has found a way to make thinner layers of
the electrolyte, which allows the cells to run at a slightly
cooler 800 degrees C (1,500 F). That change will eliminate the
sealing problems and double the power output, the company hopes.
Ceramatech is building a high-efficiency cogeneration unit in
collaboration with <A HREF="http://www.sulzer.com/">Sulzer</A>
in Switzerland.

<P>Fuel cells still face tough competition in a world with cheap
oil, but they are no longer only of interest to <A
HREF="http://www.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/technology/sts-newsref/sts-eps.html#sts-fuel-cell">Space
Shuttle</A> astronauts. And if you live in a part of the world
where electricity is expensive or far away, they may be coming
soon to your neighborhood.

Mary Leakey, one of the world's most renowned hunters of early
human fossils, died in Nairobi on December 9, 1996, at the age
of 83. Crowning triumphs of her long career included such finds
as the 1972 discovery (with Louis, her husband and
collaborator) of 1.75-million-year-old remains from <A
HREF="http://mac246.ed.uiuc.edu/edpsy-387/Bonnie-Sklar/hhabilis.

discovery of 3.6-million-year-old <A
HREF="http://www.carleton.ca/~tpatters/Museum/man/
footprint.html">footprints at Laetoli</A>, both in Tanzania.

Marguerite Holloway, originally appeared in the October 1994
issue of <I>Scientific American</I>.

<P>Mary Leakey waits for my next question, watching from behind a
thin curtain of cigar smoke. Leakey is as famous for her
precision, her love of strong tobacco--half coronas, preferably
Dutch--and her short answers as she is for some of the most
significant archaeological and anthropological finds of this
century. The latter would have hardly been excavated without her
exactitude and toughness. And in a profession scarred by battles
of interpretation and of ego, Leakey's unwillingness to
speculate about theories of human evolution is unique.

<P>These characteristics have given Leakey a formidable reputation
among journalists and some of her colleagues. So have her pets.
In her autobiography, "Disclosing the Past," Leakey mentions a
favorite dog who tended to chomp people whom the archaeologist
didn't like, "even if I have given no outward sign." So as we
talk in her home outside Nairobi, I sit on the edge of a faded
sofa, smiling exuberantly at her two dalmatians, Jenny and Sam,
waiting for one of them to bite me. I quickly note details-- her
father's paintings on the wall, the array of silver trophies
from dog shows and a lampshade with cave painting figures on
it--in case I have to leave suddenly. But the two dogs and soon
a cat and later a puppy sleep or play, and Leakey's answers,
while consistently private, seem less terse than simply
thoughtful.

<P>Leakey first came to <A
HREF="http://www.africaonline.co.ke/AfricaOnline/
kenya/chapter1a.html">Kenya</A> and <A
HREF="http://www.interknowledge.
com/tanzania/index.html">Tanzania</A> in 1935 with her husband,
the paleontologist <A
HREF="http://www2.lucidcafe.com/lucidcafe/lucidcafe/
library/95aug/leakey.html">Louis Leakey</A>, and except for
forays to Europe and the U.S., she has been there ever since.
During those many years, she introduced modern archaeological
techniques to African fieldwork, using them to unearth stone
tools and fossil remains of early humans that have recast the
way we view our origins. Her discoveries made the early ape
Proconsul, <A HREF="http://www.ed.uiuc.edu/EdPsy-387/
Bonnie-Sklar/sites.html#olduvai">Olduvai Gorge</A>, the skull of
<I>Zinjanthropus</I> and the <A
HREF="http://www.ed.uiuc.edu/EdPsy-387/Bonnie-
Sklar/sites.html#laetoli">footprints of Laetoli</A>, if not
household names, at least terms familiar to many.

<P>Leakey was born in England, raised in large part in France and
appears to have been independent, exacting and abhorrent of
tradition from her very beginnings. Her father, an artist, took
his daughter to see the beautiful <A HREF="http://www.culture.fr/culture/gvpda-en.htm">cave
paintings</A> at such sites as Fond de Gaume and La Mouthe and
to view some of the <A
HREF="http://www.culture.fr/culture/app/eng/sommaire.htm">stone
and bone tools</A> being studied by French prehistorians. As she
has written, these works of art predisposed Leakey toward
digging, drawing and early history: "For me it was the sheer
instinctive joy of collecting, or indeed one could say treasure
hunting: it seemed that this whole area abounded in obje cts of
beauty and great intrinsic interest that could be taken from the
ground."

<P>These leanings ultimately induced Leakey at the age of about 17
to begin working on archaeological expeditions in the U.K. She
also attended lectures on archaeology, prehistory and geology at
the London Museum and at <A
HREF="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/">University College London</A>.
Leakey says she never had the patience for formal education and
never attended university; she never attended her governesses
either. (At the same time, she is delighted with her many
honorary degrees: "Well, I have worked for them by digging in
the sun.")

<P>A dinner party following a lecture one evening led her, in turn,
to Louis Leakey. In 1934 the renowned researcher asked Mary,
already recognized for her artistic talents, to do the
illustrations for a book. The two were soon off to East Africa.
They made an extraordinary team. "The thing about my mother is
that she is very low profile and very hard working," notes <A
HREF="http://www.ed.uiuc.edu/students/b-sklar/anthropologists.html#
richard">Richard E. Leakey</A>, former director of the Kenya
Wildlife Service, an iconoclast known for his efforts to ban
ivory trading and a distinguished paleontologist. "Her
commitment to detail and perfection made my father's career. He
would not have been famous without her. She was much more
organized and structured and much more of a technician. He was
much more excitable, a magician."

<P>What the master and the magician found in their years of
brushing away the past did not come easily. From 1935 until 1959
the two worked at various sites throughout Kenya and Tanzania,
searching for the elusive remains of early humans. They
encountered all kinds of obstacles, including harsh conditions
in the bush and sparse funding. Success too was sparse--until
1948. In that year Mary found the first perfectly preserved
skull and facial bones of a hominoid, Proconsul, which was about
16 million years old. This tiny Miocene ape, found on Rusinga
Island in Lake Victoria, provided anthropologists with their
first cranium from what was thought to be the <A
HREF="http://earth.ics.uci.edu:8080/faqs/faq-transitional/
part2a.html">missing link</A>--a tree-dwelling monkey boasting a
bigger brain than its contemporaries.

Proconsul was a stupendous find, but it did not improve the flow
of funds. The Leakeys remained short of financial support until
1959. The big break came one morning in Olduvai Gorge</A>, an
area of Tanzania near the <A
HREF="http://www.africaonline.co.ke/AfricaOnline/kenya/chapter1.html">
Great Rift Valley</A> that slices East Africa from north to
south. Again it was Mary who made the discovery. Louis was sick,
and Mary went out to hunt around. Protruding slightly from one
of the exposed sections was a roughly 1.8-million-year-old
hominid skull, soon dubbed Zinjanthropus. Zinj became the first
of a new group--<A HREF="http://www.ed.uiuc.edu/
students/b-sklar/boisei.html"><I>Australopithecus boisei</I></A>--and
the first such skull to be found in East Africa.

<P>"For some reason, that skull caught the imagination," Leakey
recalls, pausing now and then to relight her slowly savored
cigar or to chastise a dalmatian for being too forward. "But
what it also did, and that was very important for our point of
view, it caught the imagination of the <A
HREF="http://www.nationalgeographic.com/ngs/hq/research/research.html">
National Geographic Society</A>, and as a result they funded us
for years. That was exciting."

<P>How Zinj fits into the family tree is not something Leakey will
speculate about. "I never felt interpretation was my job. What I
came to do was to dig things up and take them out as well as I
could," she describes. "There is so much we do not know, and the
more we do know, the more we realize that early interpretations
were completely wrong. It is good mental exercise, but people
get so hot and nasty about it, which I think is ridiculous."

<P>I try to press her on another <A
HREF="http://www.mc.maricopa.edu/anthropology/Debate.html">bone
of contention</A>: Did we Homo sapiens <A
HREF="http://www.archaeology.org/9609/abstracts/dna.html">emerge
in Africa</A>, or did we spring up all over the world from
different ancestors, a theory referred to as the multiregional
hypothesis? Leakey starts to laugh. "You'll get no fun out of me
over these things. If I were Richard, I would talk to you for
hours about it, but I just don't think it is worth it." She
pauses. "I really like to feel that I am on solid ground, and
that is never solid ground."

<P><table cellpadding=1 align=right width= ><tr>

<br clear=all><A HREF="http://www.ed.uiuc.edu/students/b-sklar/cultures.html"><center><B>Oldowan Tools</B></center></A></td>
</tr></table>
In the field, Leakey was clearly on terra firma. Her sites were
carefully plotted and dated, and their stratigraphy--that is,
the geologic levels needed to establish the age of finds--was
rigorously maintained. In addition to the hominid remains found
and catalogued at Olduvai, Leakey discovered <A
HREF="http://www.ed.uiuc.edu/students/b-sklar/cultures.
html">tools</A> as old as two million years: Oldowan stone
tools. She also recorded how the artifacts changed over time,
establishing a second form, Developed Oldowan, that was in use
until some 500,000 years ago.

<P>"The archaeological world should be grateful that she was in
charge at Olduvai," notes Rick Potts, a physical anthropologist
from the <A HREF="http://www.si.edu/">Smithsonian
Institution</A> who is studying <A
HREF="http://www.gorp.com/gorp/location/africa/kenya/ke_nair2.htm">Olorgesailie</A>,
a site about an hour south of Nairobi where the Leakeys found
ancient stone axes in 1942. Now, as they did then, the tools
litter the white, sandy Maasai savanna. The most beautiful ones
have been stolen, and one of Leakey's current joys is that the
Smithsonian is restoring the site and its small museum and plans
to preserve the area.

<P>Olduvai Gorge has not fared as well. After years of residence
and work there, and after the death of Louis in 1972, Mary
finally retired in 1984. Since then, she has worked to finish a
final volume on the Olduvai discoveries and has also written a
book on the <A
HREF="http://www.wits.ac.za/wits/science/archaeology/unesco.htm">rock
paintings of Tanzania</A>. "I got too old to live in the bush,"
she explains. "You really need to be youngish and healthy, so it
seemed stupid to keep going." Once she left, however, the site
was ignored. "I go once a year to the <A
HREF="http://www.aps.edu/HTMLPages/africa.html">Serengeti</A> to
see the wildebeest migrations because that means a lot to me,
but I avoid Olduvai if I can because it is a ruin. It is most
depressing." In outraged voice, she snaps out a litany of
losses: the abandoned site, the ruined museum, the stolen
artifacts, the lost catalogues. "Fortunately, there is so much
underground still. It is a vast place, and there is plenty more
under the surface for future generations that are better
educated."

<P>Leakey's most dramatic discovery, made in 1978, and the one that
she considers most important, has also been all but destroyed
since she left the field. The footprints of <A
HREF="http://mac246.ed.uiuc.edu/edpsy-
387/Bonnie-Sklar/sites.html#laetoli">Laetoli</A>, an area near
Olduvai, gave the world the first positive evidence of
bipedalism. Three hominids (generally identified as <A
HREF="http://mac246.ed.uiuc.edu/edpsy-387/
Bonnie-Sklar/afarensis.html"><I>Australopithecus
afarensis</I></A> ) had walked over volcanic ash, which
fossilized, preserving their tracks. The terrain was found to be
about 3.6 million years old. Although there had been suggestions
in the leg bones of other hominid fossils, the footprints made
the <A
HREF="http://pathfinder.com/@@CR76xgcAPFjiVE7J/time/magazine/
domestic/1995/950828/950828.science.html">age of bipedalism</A>
incontrovertible. "It was not as exciting as some of the other
discoveries, because we did not know what we had," she notes.
"Of course, when we realized what they were, then it was really
exciting."

<P>Today the famous footprints may only be salvaged with the
intervention of the <A HREF="http://www.getty.edu/gci/">Getty
Conservation Institute</A>. "Oh, they are in a terrible state,"
Leakey exclaims. "When I left, I covered them over with a mound
of river sand and then some plastic sheeting and then more sand
and a lot of boulders on top to keep the animals off and the
Maasai off." But <A HREF="http://wupa.wustl.edu/
record/archive/1996/02-15-96/2767.html">acacia trees took
root</A> and grew down among the tracks and broke them up.

<P>Although Leakey steers clear of controversy in her answers and
her writings, she has not entirely escaped it. She and <A
HREF="http://www.zstarr.com/iho/science.htm#dcjohanson">Donald
Johanson</A>, a paleontologis t at the <A
HREF="http://www.zstarr.com/iho/index.html">Institute of Human
Origins</A> in Berkeley, Calif., have feuded about the relation
between early humans found in Ethiopia and in Laetoli. (Johanson
set up his organization as a philosophical counterweight to the
L.S.B. Leakey Foundation.) And some debate erupted about how
many prints there were at Laetoli. <A
HREF="http://asz.berkeley.edu/IB/faculty/white.html">Tim
White</A> of the University of California at Berkeley claimed
that there were only two and that Leakey and her crew had made
the other track with a tool during excavation. Leakey's
response? "It was a nonsense," she laughs, and we are on to the
next subject.

<P>A subject Leakey does not like. "'What was it like to be a
woman? A mother? A wife?' I mean that is all such nonsense," she
declares. Leakey--like many other female scientists of her
generation, including Nobel laureates <A
HREF="http://www.almaz.com/nobel/medicine/1986b.html">Rita Levi-Montalcini</A> and <A
HREF="http://www.almaz.com/nobel/medicine/1988b.html">Gertrude
Belle Elion</A>--dislikes questions about being a woman in a
man's field. Her sex played no role in her work, she asserts.
She just did what she wanted to do. "I was never conscious of
it. I am not lying for the sake of anything. I never felt
disadvantaged."

<P>Leakey just did her work, surviving bitter professional wars in
anthropolog y and political upheavals. In 1952 Louis, who had
been made a member of the Kikuyu tribe during his childhood in
Africa, was marked for death during the Mau Mau uprising. The
four years during the height of the rebellion were terrifying
for the country. The brakes on Mary's car were tampered with,
and a relative of Louis's was murdered. The house that Leakey
lives in today was designed during this time: a low, white
square structure with a central courtyard where the dogs can run
at night.

<P>These pets are very important to Leakey--a source of
companionship and safety out in the bush. She admires the traits
in them that others admire in her: independence and initiative.
(Any small joy that I have about emerging from her house
unbitten fades sadly when I reread the section in her
autobiography about her telepathic dalmatian and learn that he
died years ago.)

<P>We seem to have covered everything, and so she reviews her
discoveries aloud. "But you have not mentioned the fruits," she
reminds me. One of Leakey's favorite finds is an assortment of
Miocene fossils: intact fruits, seeds, insects--including one
entire ant nest--and a lizard with its tongue hanging out. They
lay all over the sandy ground of <A HREF="http://www.cl.ais.net/compare/Kenya/regular/rusinga-island.html">Rusinga
Island</A>. "We only found them because we sat down to smoke a
cigarette, hot and tired, and just saw all these fruits lying on
the ground next to us. Before that we had been walking all over
them all over the place." She stops. "You know, you only find
what you are looking for, really, if the truth be known."

<P>Over the years, astronomers have gained <A HREF="http://skyview.gsfc.
nasa.gov/skyview.html">new perspectives on the universe</A> by exploring 
sections of the electromagnetic spectrum invisible to human eyes. More 
subtly, they have also learned to broaden their perspective on time, 
looking for events that happen so quickly that we might never notice them. 
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's orbiting <A HREF="
http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/xte/XTE.html">Rossi X-ray Timing 
Explorer</A> (RXTE) has a clever talent for both kinds of insight. It 
focuses on the energetic X-rays that originate in violent processes 
occurring around hyperdense objects such as <A HREF="http://lheawww.gsfc.
nasa.gov/users/jonathan/outreach_pages/neutron_stars.html">neutron stars</
A> and <A HREF="http://lheawww.gsfc.nasa.gov/users/jonathan/outreach_
pages/black_holes.html">black holes</A>. And unlike previous x-ray 
observatories, RXTE can observe lightning-fast flickerings--thousands of 
times per second, in some cases--that reveal unprecedented details of 
their underlying phenomena.

<P>The <A HREF="http://www.rosat.mpe-garching.mpg.de/survey/sxrb/">x-ray 
sky</A> looks very different than the familiar one. When seen though RXTE'
s eyes, the sky flares with radiation from a class of variable stars known 
as <A HREF="http://lheawww.gsfc.nasa.gov/users/jonathan/outreach_pages/
XRB.html">x-ray binaries</A>. In these misfit duos, one member has evolved 
into a neutron star, a dense stellar corpse just 20 kilometers in diameter-
-or into an even smaller yet more massive black hole. In either case, the 
collapsed star's powerful gravity snatches material from its partner, a 
more sedate star like the sun. Gas spiraling inward grows fiercely hot, 
emitting the observed X rays. In some instances, the gas collects on the 
star's surface until it reaches a critical mass, touching off a tremendous 
thermonuclear detonation.

<P>Or so the theory goes--nobody understands the exact details of what 
happens around a neutron star. But using RXTE, people like <A HREF="http:
//lheawww.gsfc.nasa.gov/~stroh/">Tod E. Strohmayer</A> of the NASA <A 
HREF="http://pao.gsfc.nasa.gov/gsfc.html">Goddard Space Flight Center</A>
 are starting to find out. In a <A HREF="http://www.aas.org/ApJ/v469n1/
5374/sc0.html">recent paper</A> in the September 20, 1996 <A HREF="http:/
/www.aas.org/ApJ/v469n1/contents.html"><I>Astrophysical Journal Letters</I>
</A>, Strohmayer and his colleagues report that the emissions from one X-
ray binary fluctuates an astounding <A HREF="http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.
gov/docs/xte/learning_ctr/discoveries/QPO2.html">1,100 times per second</A>
, much faster than any variation ever before observed. "The first thing 
you say when you see something like that is, this can't be!" he exclaims. 
M. Coleman Miller of the <A HREF="http://astro.uchicago.edu/">University 
of Chicago</A> thinks the X-ray stuttering is a kind of beat pattern that 
results from the overlapping periods of the neutron star's rotation and 
the cyclic orbiting of hot gas about to crash onto the star's surface. For 
the first time, it seems, we can actually watch a neutron star feeding.

<P>Related RXTE studies may finally settle the mystery concerning the origin 
of a group of astronomical speedsters called millisecond pulsars. About 15 
years ago, radio astronomers discovered that some <A HREF="http://www.
psc.edu/science/Taylor/LittleGreen.html">pulsars</A> (spinning neutron 
stars that emit pulses of radiation) have rotation periods of just a few 
thousandths of a second, a billion times more rapid than the sun's 
rotation. Startled theorists proposed that these pulsars might be born in 
x-ray binaries, where the disk of gas crashing onto the neutron star could 
give it a powerful kick of angular momentum. 

<P>RXTE observations of three star systems containing pulsars that emit 
brilliant <A HREF="http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/xte/learning_ctr/
discoveries/burst_psr.html">bursts of X rays</A> bolster the speculation. 
Those bursts are thought to result from the episodic nuclear explosions 
taking place on the surfaces of the neutron stars in these systems; the 
resulting hot spots act as beacons that, for a short time, allow 
astronomers to observe directly each neutron star's rotation, even through 
the overlying clouds of infalling gas. Strohmayer reports that the 
oscillation period (and so presumably the rotation period of the 
underlying star) during bursts is just 1/600th of a second--much shorter 
than the spin rate of known newborn pulsars and a strong sign that these 
stars are in fact in fact being sped up until centrifugal effects nearly 
tear them to pieces.

<P>But the process is far from cut and dried. <A HREF="http://heasarc.gsfc.
nasa.gov/docs/bios/swank.html">Jean H. Swank</A> of Goddard, the project 
scientist for RXTE, notes that neutron stars in some other x-ray binaries 
appear to slow down at times. This paradoxical phenomenon may be caused by 
magnetic interactions between the star and the surrounding accretion disk, 
though slipping and sliding between the layers of nuclear material that 
make up the star may also play a role.

<P>These findings are only the beginning. Swank hopes that RXTE will 
eventually detect x-ray variations caused by oscillations of the surfaces 
of neutron stars. Such observations would permit astronomers to perform a 
kind of remote seismology, tracing out the stars' internal structure. That 
information would offer powerful insight into the nature and behavior of 
neutrons and quarks, the building blocks of the centers of atoms. 

<P>Swank also notes that RXTE is looking far beyond our galaxy to study the 
emissions from <A HREF="http://www.kingsu.ab.ca/%7Ebrian/astro/chp14.htm"
>quasars</A>, object hardly larger than our solar system that outshine 
entire galaxies. Most astrophysicists believe that quasars are in some 
ways like giant X-ray binaries, except that the central object is a black 
hole having as much as a billion times the mass of the sun--a beast 
capable of swallowing entire stars. 

<P>Herein lies a beautiful irony. The rays we see from quasars have been 
traveling earthward for hundreds of millions of years or more--and yet 
their deepest secrets might be resolved, literally, in the blink of an eye.

<H3>The origin of life on earth appears<BR>more and more inevitable--or
does it?</H3></CENTER>

<P>These have been exciting times for scientists striving to learn
about the origin of life. The possible discovery of <A
HREF="http://www.sciam.com/explorations/081996explorations.html">fossil
microbes in a Martian meteorite</A> has already grabbed the
public's attention; another <A
HREF="http://www.nature.com/Nature2/serve?SID=64126033&CAT=Corner&PG=Update/update135.html">provocative
recent study</A> suggests that life may have arisen on the earth
far earlier than previously thought. Such work has sharpened one
of the most fascinating and least tractable debates in modern
science: Is life a remarkable aberration, or is it a likely,
perhaps even certain, outcome of the laws of nature?

<P>On one side are scientists such as the British astronomer <A
HREF="http://yorty.sonoma.edu/people/faculty/tenn/BMtext.html#63">Fred
Hoyle</A>, who once declared that the emergence of a living cell
from an inanimate chemical soup is about as likely as the 
assembly of a 747 by a whirlwind passing through a junkyard.
Let's call them improbabilists. On the other side are
inevitabilists, who believe the origin of life was a plausible
consequence of basic chemical processes. "My  guess is that life
probably isn't all that rare and the origin of life probably
wasn't all that improbable," remarks the inevitabilist <A
HREF="http://www.spacelab.net/~catalj/">Richard Dawkins</A> of
the <A HREF="http://www.ox.ac.uk/">University of Oxford in his
latest book, <A HREF
="http://www.wwnorton.com/catalog/fall96/mti.htm"><I>Climbing
Mount Improbable</I></A>.

<P>One favorite argument of inevitabilists concerns the rapidity
with which life emerged on the earth after the planet's
formation 4.5 billion years ago. The earlier that life began,
the more inevitable it must have been--or so the argument goes.
Inevitabilists have thus been greatly heartened by the recent
report, published in the November 7 issue of <A
HREF="http://www.nature.com/"><I>Nature</I></A>, which pushes
the date for the existence of terrestrial life back to at least
3.85 billion years ago.

<P>This finding comes from an international team of scientists that
found what it believes to be chemical traces of life--carbon
isotopes in a ratio characteristic of living organisms--in <A
HREF="http://www.brookes.ac.uk/geology/rock.html">rocks from
Akilia </A>, an island off the coast of Greenland. The rocks,
which have been dated at 3.85 billion years of age, are the most
ancient known to science.

<P>Previously, the oldest evidence for life was fossilized microbes
from a rock formation in Australia that is 3.5 billion years
old. The <A
HREF="http://www.reston.com/astro/press/nasa.pr.96.230.html">new,
earlier date is particularly significant</A>, because some
evidence indicates that during this period <A
HREF="http://www1.sjmercury.com/news/scitech/eden/timeline.gif">the
earth was still a hellish place</A>. In the late 1980s
geologists studying craters on the <A
HREF="http://bang.lanl.gov/solarsys/moon.htm">moon</A> concluded
that until roughly 3.8 billion years ago, the moon and, by
inference, the earth were being constantly blasted by
meteorites; some of the terrestrial impacts would supposedly
have been large enough to incinerate any life.

<P>If life did indeed exist during this era, it was not necessarily
the precursor to modern organisms; it may have been wiped out by
a meteor impact only to spring up again elsewhere, notes John M.
Hayes of the <A HREF="http://www.whoi.edu/">Woods Hole
Oceanographic Institution</A>. But the existence of any kind of
biological organism 3.85 billion years ago suggests that life
developed with "breathtaking rapidity," Hayes declares in a
commentary on the new finding in <A
HREF="http://www.nature.com/"><I>Nature</I></A>.

/www.santafe.edu/sfi/People/kauffman/index.html">Stuart
Kauffman</A>, a biochemist and complexity theorist at the Santa
Fe Institute, believes life is a robust phenomenon.</FONT></td>
</tr></table>

Indeed, this report, together with the much heralded
announcement by other scientists this past August that they had
found what might be fossilized <A
HREF="http://science-mag.aaas.org/science/scripts/display/short/273/5277/924.html">remnants
of life in a  meteorite from Mars</A>, implies that life is a
robust and possibly ubiquitous phenomenon. At least, that is the

of such leading inevitabilists as <A HREF="http:/
/www.santafe.edu/sfi/People/kauffman/index.html">Stuart
Kauffman</A>, a biochemist and complexity theorist at the Santa
Fe Institute.

<P>Nevertheless, the improbabilist position still has a few rather
substantial facts in its favor. First, the evidence that life
existed on earth 3.85 billion years ago--like the evidence for
ancient life on Mars--remains <A
HREF="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/
et/access?ac=150854964790&pg=//96/10/24/nmars24.html">far from
conclusive</A>. The claims rest on subtle and possibly ambiguous
analyses of chemical traces. As various researchers have pointed
out, non-biological processes could have produced these putative
fossil remnants on both worlds.

<P>Moreover, the underlying uniformity of life on the earth (most
notably, all modern organisms share the same DNA-based mechanism
for genetic transmission) suggests that life emerged here only
once during the planet's entire history. There is no evidence
that any other type of life developed independently, even for a
brief period.

</tr></table>

And despite the immensely powerful tools associated with modern
biotechnology, scientists still cannot transform inanimate
matter into life in the laboratory. Pondering this problem, the
Nobel laureate <A
HREF="http://www.salk.edu/faculty/crick.html">Francis Crick</A>
once lamented that the origin of life seems "a miracle, so many
are the conditions which would have to be satisfied to get it
going." As a partial solution, Crick proposed in his 1981 book,
<I>Life Itself</I>, that the first organisms might  have been
brought to the earth by intelligent aliens. That answer, of
course, only shifts the problem of life's origin to some as yet
unknown but perhaps more conducive setting elsewhere in the
universe.

<P>Crick's argument echoed the so-called <A
HREF="http://funky.tamu.edu/link.htm">panspermia hypothesis</A>
developed more than a century earlier by the Swedish physicist
<A
HREF="http://www.kcsnet.or.kr/education/fame/arrhenius.html">Svante
Arrhenius</A>, w ho thought that the seeds of terrestrial life
drifted here from elsewhere in the universe. Arrhenius's
grandson, <A
HREF="http://checfs1.ucsd.edu/~nscort/Research/Arrhenius/arrhenius_research.html">Gustaf
Arrhenius</A> of the <A HREF="http://sio.ucsd.edu /">Scripps
Institution of Oceanography</A> in La Jolla, Calif., continues
to wrestle with the questions that so fascinated his ancestor:
he headed the team that analyzed the Akilia rocks.

<P>Gustaf Arrhenius neither rejects nor adheres to his
grandfather's theory of life's origin. He is also an agnostic on
the whole question of life's probability--or lack
thereof--noting that there is simply too little evidence to
settle the issue. He contends, for example, that the lunar data
do not conclusively demonstrate that the earth was battered by
meteorites until 3.8 billion years ago; no signs of severe
impacts show up in the few terrestrial rocks remaining from that
period. It is therefore quite possible that the earth was suited
for life much sooner after its formation.

<P>Arrhenius hopes that <A
HREF="http://cmex-www.arc.nasa.gov/MarsNews/mars_papers/Docs/mars_strat.html">future
missions to Mars</A> may help to resolve questions over the
"late bombardment" scenario. Such missions could also determine
whether microbial life  did indeed once take hold there--or
whether it even still exists. The current <A
HREF="http://mpfwww.jpl.nasa.gov/">Mars Pathfinder</A> and <A
HREF="http://mpfwww.jpl.nasa.gov/">Mars Global Surveyor</A>
missions are trailblazers that cannot search directly for life,
however; the robotic probes needed to undertake the necessary
experiments are still a decade or more away. Until at least
then, Arrhenius says, the debate between the inevitabilists and
the improbalists will remain "pure speculation."

<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=351>
Biomedical research, like everything else in the modern world,
is happening faster and faster. Computers in laboratories around
the globe control robotic equipment that produces torrents of
data, and scientists must struggle to keep up with who has done
what, where, why and how. Computer databases that make results
quickly accessible to anyone with a modem have certainly helped
spread the information. Now one scientist is trying to use
silicon brains to navigate through the maze of data, aiding
researchers in their hunt for new cures and therapies.
<P>Wearied by trying to stay abreast of a deluge of minutely
detailed information, molecular biologist <A
HREF="http://WWW-SMI.Stanford.EDU/people/altman/index.html">Russ B.
Altman</A> of Stanford University is developing ways to distill
all the essential content of some 300 research reports in his
subspecialty and represent it in a computer-readable form that
specialized software will be able to interrogate in complex
ways. Other researchers around the world will have access to
that knowledge base and will be able to use the specialized
search software via the World Wide Web.
<P>Altman is including in his knowledge base not just data from the
"results" sections of the reports but also information about how
experiments were done and about the facts and principles the
experimenters employed in interpreting them. Altman hopes once
he gets his knowledge base off to a good start, other
researchers worldwide will be willing to follow his lead: they,
too, will encode their research publications (using programs
that he is developing) and add them to the knowledge base.
<P>Researchers should gain several advantages from such a system.
They could, for example, set up search programs that would alert
them whenever anyone inputs new research that impinges directly
on their subject of interest. Other functions could instantly
alert investigators to conflicts between their findings and
those previously reported elsewhere--even if the contradictory
studies were done decades ago.
<P>Most important, Altman maintains that his knowledge base will
actually help workers generate and test hypotheses, because it
will be able to evaluate quickly whether a fresh idea is
consistent with everything known so far. "You can imagine
writing a query that says, 'Give me all the reported values of
this number that embody assumption X, " Altman told a crowd of
physician-researchers at a recent gathering at the <A HREF="
http://www2.nas.edu/iom/">Institute of Medicine</A> in
Washington, D.C. Altman's attempt to represent scientific
knowledge draws on ideas that originated in artificial
intelligence but have not seen wide use in science or everyday
life. "Scientists won't be replaced," he claims, "but they will
be augmented."

</A> a computer program, draws on numerous sources of data to create
detailed estimates of structure, such as this protein complex from a
ribosome. Data and constraints can easily be changed to test theories.<HR></FONT></CENTER>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
Altman's area of expertise is the structure of <A
HREF="http://server.cs.
stedwards.edu/contrib/Chemistry/CHEM43/Ribosomes/Ribosome.HTML">ribosomes</A>, minute structures that synthesize proteins inside cells.
Ribosomes are the sites where some antibiotics operate, so there
could be big medical payoffs in a better understanding of how
the ribosomal engine works. Altman anticipates that his
ribosomal structure knowledge base will eventually grow to
incorporate work of interest to researchers in allied fields,
such as those studying the chemistry of RNA. Altman's prototype
information repository, called <A
HREF="http://www-smi.stanford.edu/
events/abstracts/abstract_1995101615000031.html">Riboweb</A>,
will soon be accessible via the Web.
<P>Turning a written research report into something that a computer
can sort and organize is not easy. Altman's first attempt to
render a published paper into machine-analyzable form took two
weeks, but as the concepts and relationships in the knowledge
base have accumulated, the amount of work needed to represent
successive papers has dropped dramatically. His goal is to
produce user-friendly programs that enable a scientist to enter
the contents of his or her latest paper in less than an hour.
The research contained therein could then be analyzed, in
conjunction with all other relevant findings, by any
investigators having a computer and a modem. Altman has recently
been awarded grants by the <A HREF="http://www.nlm.
nih.gov/">National Library of Medicine</A> and by the <A
HREF="http:// www.nsf.gov/">National Science Foundation</A> to
develop his system.
<P>Riboweb is just one among many imaginative research projects
springing up on the Web, which is rapidly evolving into a
collaborative tool with functions that extend far beyond simply
publishing data. The Molecular Science Exploratorium at the <A
HREF="http://www.sdsc.edu/">San Diego Supercomputing Center</A>
(SDSC), for example, allows researchers to examine detailed
graphic renderings of molecular structures; the users can then
follow a hyperlink that leads straight to the research reports
that produced those images. The SDSC has also set up an
experimental <A HREF="
http://www.sdsc.edu/pb/Group.html">"Computational Molecular
Biology Project Area"</A> on the Web. And Claudine Medigue of
the <A HREF="http:/ /www.pasteur.fr/welcome-uk.html">Pasteur
Institute</A> in Paris has created an <A
HREF="http://www.pasteur.fr/Bio/pub/Medigue1.html">expert
system</A> that assists researchers in utilizing computer
programs to analyze genetic sequences.
<P>Altman believes computer representation of research reports will
be especially useful in mature fields that have well-defined
concepts and analytical techniques. In these fields,
investigators pushing into new areas of research should be able
to encode their results relatively easily. His experience
suggests to him that areas such as <A HREF="http://www.
sciam.com/WEB/explorations/060396explorations.html">combinatorial
chemistry</A> and clinical trials, as well as much of molecular
biology, would be especially well suited to computer
representation.
<P>Other scientists are watching Altman's project with interest. <A
HREF=" http://www.biology.ucsc.edu/Faculty/noller.html">Harry
F. Noller, Jr.</A>, of the University of California at Santa
Cruz, a ribosome biologist who occasionally collaborates with
Altman, suggests the success of the scheme will depend crucially
on how easy it becomes to encode a research report." By the
time you've finished a paper you're about ready for the oxygen
tent, " he notes; investigators will be unwilling to invest much
additional effort to feed their findings into a persnickety
computer.
<P>Another major question concerns who will be responsible for
maintaining the computer-based records of scientific endeavor.
The Swiss government caused an uproar among biomedical
researchers recently when it decided it no longer wanted to
support financially a protein database, <A HREF="http
://expasy.hcuge.ch/sprot/sprot-top.html">Swiss-Prot</A>, that
had originated as a research project. Altman acknowledges he
will not be able to run Riboweb forever by himself. He hopes
academic publishers might step in to manage it and establish
other scientific knowledge bases. The companies' profits could
derive from small fees that they could charge their scientist
customers. Although most firms are still struggling to find ways
of building sustainable--read "profitable"--Web-based
businesses, some large academic publishers have expressed
interest in Riboweb, Altman says.
<P>Many established journals have already taken the leap onto the
Web. Perhaps science will in time slip completely into
cyberspace, liberating investigators and trees from the
hard-copy legacy of ever longer shelves groaning under the
weight of ever more detailed and dusty tomes.

<H3>An unusual concentration<BR>

Mainstream movies are usually not very kind to science--witness
the implausible and sinister behavior of the tornadoes in
<I>Twister</I> or the secretive ineptitude of the government
researchers in <I>Independence Day</I>. So it is a pleasant
surprise to see two thoughtful, scientifically literate
films--<I>Infinity</I> and <I>Microcosmos</I>--now going
head-to-head with the likes of <I>The First Wives Club</I>.<P>

<A HREF="http://www.flp.com/infinity/synopsis.html"><I><B>Infinity</B></I></A>--
a biography of the late physicist <A HREF="http://www.mindspring.com/~madpickl/stuff3.htm#intro">
Richard Feynman</A>--is in some respects the more unusual of the two.
It stars <A HREF="http://www.flp.com/infinity/ cast.html">
Matthew Broderick and Patricia Arquette</A>, both well-known Hollywood actors. But
the subject is not the usual Hollywood fare: <I> Infinity</I>
concerns Feynman's childhood and early adult years, focusing on
his work on the <A HREF="http://www.glue.umd.edu/~enola/dvel/dvelbomb.html">
Manhattan Project</A> and on his relationship with his
first wife, Arline, who died of tuberculosis at a young age. The
result is a curious hybrid, part an account of the making of a
scientist, part morality tale and part tragic romance.<P>
The screenplay for <I>Infinity</I> derives from chapters in
Feynman's two best-selling books of reminiscences, <I>Surely
You're Joking Mr. Feynman!</I> and <I>What Do <U>You</U> Care
What Other People Think?</I>. To the credit of Broderick (who
directed as well), the movie hews quite closely to its source.
The early sections showing how Richard's father, Melville,
fostered his youthful curiosity offer a rare, perceptive look at
a budding scientific mind. In one touching scene, the young
Richard asks his father why when he pulls his wagon forward, the
ball sitting in the wagon rolls to the back. Melville Feynman
responds with a serious discussion of inertia and
explains--quite accurately--that we know what inertia does, but
nobody knows at the deepest level what it is. Later, Richard
tries to explain to his father how an electron can emit a photon
even though the photon was not "really" there before. These
well-drawn exchanges eloquently express the way a scientist
views the world.<P>

</TABLE>
Unfortunately, <I>Infinity</I> is limited by Broderick's
excessive reverence for his subject. Feynman's reminiscences,
which appeared in print 40 years after the fact, are tinged with
longing and arrogant pride but carefully do not reveal too much
emotion. The movie, too, feels oddly remote. As a child Feynman
had an almost pathological fear of being seen as a "sissy"; the
emotional trauma of Arline's death and the moral conundrum of
working on the Manhattan Project surely figured into his later,
carefully cultivated madcap persona. But <I>Infinity</I> offers
only sporadic glimpses of Feynman's inner turmoil. There is
little sign of the dark restlessness that led him to crack safes
at <A HREF="http://bang.lanl.gov/video/history/lanl50th/Homepage.html">Los
Alamos</A> or bang on the bongos long into the night.<P>
<I>Infinity</I> does not attempt a comprehensive overview of
Feynman's life and work. You will not see his work on quantum
electrodynamics (which netted him a Nobel Prize in 1965), his
groundbreaking ideas about what we now call "quarks," or his
theory of superfluidity. You will not witness his brushes with
anti-Semitism or his often abusive treatment of women. (First
Look Pictures has helpfully placed some additional information
about Feynman on the <A HREF="http://www.flp.com/infinity/index.html"><I>Infinity</I>
Web site</A>.) What you will see is an intriguing, if somewhat
romanticized, portrait of the scientist as a young man.<P>
<A HREF="http://www.miramax.com/microcosmos/movie.html"><I>Microcosmos</I></A> 
sets its sights on a somewhat less problematic set of
characters: the insects and other tiny creatures that inhabit a
field in the south of France. Biologists Claude Nuridsany and
Marie Perennou long ago left the university to seek new ways to
communicate science to the public. <I> Microcosmos</I>, their
first full-length movie, deliberately avoids the conventions of
nature documentaries.<P>
The filmmakers have completely dispensed with narration, relying
instead on sharp camera work, stop- motion photography and a
clever soundtrack (using real but highly amplified insect
noises) to keep the action moving. Custom-made lighting
techniques and robot-controlled cameras allow the viewer to <A
HREF=" http://www.miramax.com/microcosmos/abt_movie.html">swoop
down and explore life down in the grasses</A>. Nuridsany
describes the result as "one day in the life of the bugs in this
meadow," but the film actually took three years to produce. The
craft--which <A HREF="http://www.filmscouts.com/films/microco.html">
snared a technical award</A> at the Cannes
Film Festival--shows in a succession of remarkable close-ups of
insects in action.<P>

</TR>
</TABLE>
<I>Microcosmos</I> displays an obvious sympathy for a meadow's
tiny inhabitants. The filmmakers have avoided predation scenes
that depict the world of insects as cruel and harsh; their
stated goal is to "rehabilitate insects and put them back into
their right place." At the same time, Nuridsany insists that
"the film is objective, not false." If the insects seem like
individual characters in a drama, he argues, that is only
because they acted that way. Indeed, he notes that one of the
educational messages he wishes to communicate is that, contrary
to entomological dogma, not all insects are alike. During
filming, Nuridsany and Perennou discovered that there is
considerable individual variation in the way the insects
performed before the camera. Some <A HREF="http://www.miramax.com/microcosmos/ladybugs.html">
ladybugs</A> would fly away home
right away, while others would go about their routine
undisturbed.<P>
As a scientific movie, <I>Microcosmos</I> has some notable
flaws. (Here again, a <A HREF="http://www.miramax.com/microcosmos/ ">related Web site</A>
fills in many details missing from the film itself.) The
creatures depicted are not identified when they appear
on-screen. The frequent distortions of time make it hard to
gauge the real pace of events. And <I>Microcosmos</I> inevitably
projects human attributes onto its buggy players.<P>
Watching a <A HREF="http://www.miramax.com/microcosmos/dungball.html">
dung beetle</A> wrestle with a ball of excrement
that has lodged onto a stick protruding from the ground, you
feel the creature's bemused frustration; the sexual coupling of
a <A HREF="http://www. miramax.com/microcosmos/snails.html">pair
of snails</A> is nothing if not erotic. The film blatantly
encourages this empathetic impulse: the snails' scene is
accompanied by an operatic blast that is unabashedly romantic.
The filmmakers admit that "we wanted to show them as human
beings, with their concerns, and the way they deal with their
everyday lives."<P>
Those goals may border on anthropomorphism, but they do make for
good entertainment. Young viewers will have no trouble
understanding what is going on (although the movie, lacking an
overall narrative, probably runs too long to hold the attention
of small children). Nuridsany states that his real goal is to
bring in adult moviegoers and return them to a state of childish
wonder. "There is something magical about the very small world,
" he says. It is a magic that <I>Microcosmos</I> captures well.<P>

<CENTER><BR><H1>Gene Therapy</H1>
<H3>Early trials encountered unforeseen<BR> 
complications. A new round of<BR>
more sophisticated strategies<BR>
may turn the tide.</H3></CENTER>
Just a year ago, genetic therapies--treatments that work by
rewriting bits of genetic code in a patient's cells--were widely
heralded as the next great champion of modern medicine. Then the
champ hit an unexpected slump. Gene therapy took a standing
eight-count last winter, after drug contenders sponsored by a
host of biotechnology and drug companies failed to cure a single
patient of disease. In a <A
HREF="http://www.sosei.com/BioCentury2/archive/1995/4qtr/121195a4.htm">highly
critical report</A> issued last December, a review panel at the
<A HREF="http://www.nih.gov/index.html">National Institutes of
Health</A> chided researchers and investors for rushing
treatments into human clinical trials before fully understanding
all the natural defenses that genetic medicines must conquer or
evade if they are to work.
<P>Somewhat chastened, geneticists are studying their failures and
starting to develop a clearer picture of what they are up
against. Many researchers are optimistic that the present
retrenchment actually bodes well for the long-term success of
genetic medicines. In laboratories and on Wall Street, there are
signs that gene therapy is starting to stage a comeback.
<P>The challenge facing genetic medicines is daunting. First, they
must somehow deliver their genetic payload into enough cells to
do some good. Retroviruses seemed well suited for this task,
because these kinds of viruses normally infect cells by copying
part of their DNA into the genetic code of a host cell. Most
early trials of genetic medicines therefore co-opted
retroviruses, replacing their harmful parts with genes intended
to help treat a disease, such as cystic fibrosis or brain
cancer.
<P>But viral drugs can take effect only if they can slip past the
multilayered defenses of the human immune system. First comes an
onslaught of antibodies soon after any familiar virus is
detected in the bloodstream. These antibodies quickly bind up
the virus and can also cause side effects such as inflammation.
Viral particles that make it to target cells face a second
obstacle: a <A
HREF="http://www.scientia.org/scientia/caduceus/cards/biology/nucmembrane.html">tough
membrane</A> shielding the cell's DNA from attackers. Finally,
those retroviruses that are lucky enough to make it past the
immune defenses and to infect cells do so in an unpredictable
manner; they typically will insert the therapeutic gene at a
random position in the cell's DNA. The new gene might interrupt
an important sequence, actually harming the cell. Even in the
best case, new genes often end up in dormant stretches of DNA
where they do not get switched on frequently enough to make much
of a difference to the patient.
<P>Geneticists were humbled by these barriers, but they were not
stumped. A second wave of enthusiasm for gene therapy is now
well under way, thanks to recent advances that suggest new
strategies. In September, <A
HREF="http://www.streetnet.com/features/apr96/drug-side06.html">RPR
Gencell</A> (a network of gene therapy research centers
organized by the French company Rhone-Poulenc Rorer) published
results in <A
HREF="http://medicine.nature.com/1996-September/retrovirusmediatedwildtypeipig"><I>Nature
Medicine</I></A> describing its test of a retroviral gene
therapy for lung cancer. The researchers injected the drug
containing normal versions of p53--a gene that suppresses
tumors--directly into nine patients' tumors. This technique
avoided triggering a general immune response and exploited the
rapid division of tumor cells. Tumors shrank significantly in
three of the patients and stopped growing in three others;
nevertheless, all nine patients died.
<P>Results from two other groups recently suggested that it might
be possible to design gene therapies that altogether avoid
viruses and their many drawbacks. Workers at the University of
Chicago and at <A
HREF="http://www.sddt.com/files/library/1corporateprofiles/corpstories/VICAL.html">Vical</A>,
a biotechnology firm in San Diego, rolled a gene for
erythropoietin into a circular DNA package called a plasmid.
Erythropoietin is a hormone that triggers the body to produce
red blood cells. Another biotechnology company, Amgen, sells
nearly $1 billion of its synthetic version each year to patients
afflicted with anemia and other blood disorders.
<P>In an article published October 1 in the <A
HREF="http://journals.at-home.com/get_doc/413806/8794">Proceedings
of the National Academy of Sciences</A>, the Chicago group
reported that simply injecting the naked DNA into the
hindquarters of normal mice boosted their red blood cell counts
by a third. Equally important, the counts remained higher up to
90 days after the injection, strongly indicating that the genes
had taken hold (at least for a while) and begun producing
hormone. "Our results suggest that intramuscular injection of
currently available genes could be used to treat a variety of
serum protein deficiency diseases," such as anemia, hemophilia
and diabetes, says <A
HREF="http://card-mac14.bsd.uchicago.edu/levin/pages/Cardfac.html">Jeffrey
M. Leiden</A>, director of the study at the University of
Chicago.
<P>Boosting blood-cell production does little good for patients
whose blood cells are malformed, such as those of sickle cell
anemics. The ultimate goal of gene therapy is not to compensate
for genetic diseases but to erase them completely. Preliminary
work published in the September 6 issue of <A
HREF="http://science-mag.aaas.org/science/scripts/display/short/273/5280/1386.html"><I>Science</I></A>
offers a reason to hope that goal may be possible. A team led by
Allyson Cole-Strauss and Kyonggeun Yoon of <A
HREF="http://www.tju.edu/">Thomas Jefferson University</A> in
Philadelphia experimented on cells containing a mutant gene that
causes sickle cell anemia. To make their genetic drug, they
combined DNA for the normal version of this gene with RNA for
the same gene.
<P>When they injected the drug into the diseased cells, the RNA/DNA
particles homed in on the particular stretch of the genome that
matched their codes and formed triple-stranded DNA that covered
the mutation. The cells' normal DNA-repair machinery then
apparently replaced the mutation with the normal code--thus
permanently curing 10 to 20 percent of the cells. The
researchers still have to demonstrate that this technique works
in human cells and in human bodies.
<P>While scientists and the public slowly allow optimism to creep
back into discussions about gene therapy, investors and
biotechnology companies are unabashedly bullish once more. By
July, 216 clinical trials of gene therapies were planned or
under way, according to the <A
HREF="http://www.pasteur.fr/welcome-uk.html">Pasteur
Institute</A> in Paris. "Biotech firms of every kind are
scrambling to reposition themselves as genomics companies," says
Joan E. Kureczka, an industry publicist.
<P>Gene therapy may emerge a winner in this round, though the match
will likely draw on for years to come. The longer the search and
the larger the investment, however, the more expensive that
treatments will be when they do arrive. The greatest challenges
to the medical wonders promised by gene therapy may well turn
out to be economic rather than scientific.

in public records--from the Oregon Department of Motor Vehicles for $222.
Faced with complaints from thousands of people, including the governor,
John Kitzhaber, Nabil has suspended the site's operation for the time
being.
<P>But Nabil is only a small-time operator when it comes to presenting
prominently information that many would prefer to keep from public view.
For the past few weeks, the Internet has hummed with belated concern about
the 300 million names and addresses filed in P-TRAK, an electronic locator
service run by database behemoth <A
HREF="http://www.lexis-nexis.com/lncc/">Lexis-Nexis</A>. P-TRAK, which
has been available to subscribers since the beginning of June, is
generated by culling information from credit reports but does not contain
any financial information. Rather <A
HREF="http://www.lexis-nexis.com/lncc/p-trak/sample.html">the
records</A> contain people's names and addresses (both current and
previous), birthdates, telephone numbers and Social Security numbers.
Although P-TRAK <A
HREF="http://www.news.com/News/Item/0,4,1539,00.html">no longer displays
Social Security numbers</A>, one can work backward and <A
HREF="http://www.news.com/News/Item/0,4,3608,00.html">retrieve records by
Social Security number</A>; it is therefore possible to assemble a
complete set of information on a particular person.
<P>There is nothing illegal about P-TRAK, which is precisely why it has
aroused such concern. The rise of the Internet and of various searchable,
dial-in databases is permitting unprecedented access to public but
sensitive details. Many observers have suggested that the information
contained in P-TRAK would be sufficient, among other things, for an
unscrupulous user to impersonate someone in dealings with financial or
other institutions.
<P>Lexis-Nexis anticipated that some people might object to being listed in
P-TRAK and set up a toll-free number for those who wanted their names
removed from the database. So many people called, however, that the
company quickly switched to accepting requests <A
HREF="http://www.lexis-nexis.com/lncc/p-trak/p-trak.html">only by mail,
fax or Web</A>. Lesley Sprigg, Lexis-Nexis spokesperson, declined to say
how many people had opted out so far. She also stated that the service had
been started largely as a competitive reaction to products offered by
other firms, including Web sites and CD-ROMs containing searchable,
national telephone directories, such as <A
HREF="http://www.whowhere.com/phone.html">WhoWhere?</A>, <A
HREF="http://www.switchboard.com/">Switchboard</A> and <A
HREF="http://www.four11.com/">Four11</A>.
<P>Sprigg claims that Lexis-Nexis conducts checks on all its clients before
signing them up for P-TRAK; the company's terms and conditions include
strict limitations on the use of information in its databases. A typical
user of P-TRAK might be an estate attorney tracking down missing heirs or
a Fortune 1000 company searching for pension beneficiaries. (The company's
<A
HREF="http://www.lexis-nexis.com/lncc/products/media/issue396.html">promotional
material</A> paints a somewhat different picture, however, highlighting
the ease of finding people who use multiple aliases, own no property and
do not have listed telephone numbers; nor is there any kind of company
policy statement about how P-TRAK data should or should not be used.)
<P>Regardless of what eventually becomes of P-TRAK, the controversy over the
database--which sits in the hands of one of the largest information
retailers in the world--has focused attention on the question of who
should have access to even the most rudimentary personal information.
Organizations such as the <A HREF="http://epic.org/">Electronic Privacy
Information Center</A> (EPIC) are raising the alarm about the dark side of
rapid increases in central-processor speed, hard-disk storage capacity and
modem bandwidth. These days, almost anyone who owns a computer can keep
files on millions of fellow citizens if their data are available in
electronic form. As a result, Internet libertarians are feeling an acute
tension between the twin goals of unfettered exchange of information and
personal privacy.
<P>Unlike virtually every other industrial country, the U.S. has no
comprehensive regulations restricting the collection and sale of personal
data. But there are signs that the situation may be changing. <A
HREF="http://www.house.gov/mbr_dir/WI04.html">Representative Gerald D.
Kleczka</A>, a Democrat from Wisconsin, has introduced <A
HREF="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:H.R.3598:">legislation</A>
that would prohibit use of Social Security numbers (currently the most
widely used identifying key) in commercial databases without a subject's
consent. If enacted, such a law would give consumers significant leverage
in determining how their names, buying habits, financial track records and
medical profiles are traded on the increasingly open market.

<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=350><P><BR>
<P>Few tasks in science are so daunting as attempts to unravel the workings
of the human mind; the range of mental processes seems almost without
limit. Neurobiologists have therefore often sought clues about normal
functioning by observing the specific changes that result from brain
damage. One of the most striking of these mental disabilities is 
<A HREF="http://www.psychol.ucl.ac.uk/patrick.haggard/c567/c5678.html">
anosognosia</A>--derived from the Greek for "loss of knowledge"--which
was first described by French neurologist <A
HREF="http://www.biography.com/cgi-bin/biography/biography-request.pl?page=/biography/data/B/B.962.txt.html">M.J.
Babinski</A> in 1914. Anosognosia has long fascinated cognitive scientists
because it suggests that perception and self-awareness may be distinct
functions carried out by separate parts of the brain.
<P>Anosognosia usually occurs among people who have suffered a <A
HREF="http://www.nih.gov/ninds/healinfo/disorder/stroke/strokepr.htm">stroke</A>
in the right hemisphere of their brains that has made them unable to use
their left arms or legs. Such persons are said to be hemiplegic. A small
proportion of these hemiplegics display a remarkable symptom: they cannot
perceive that they are paralyzed. They insist that their paralyzed limbs
are functioning normally, even immediately after failing to perform some
simple task that requires their use.
<P>Now two researchers at the <A HREF="http://psy.ucsd.edu/">University of
California at San Diego</A>'s Center for Research on Brain and Cognition
have shown that in some patients the effects of anosognosia are more
profound than previously recognized. Some anosognosics not only are
unaware of their own paralysis, they are also unable to perceive paralysis
in others. This finding seems to indicate that our awareness of ourselves
is inextricably entwined with our awareness of others.
<P>The experiment, described in the August 8 issue of <A
HREF="http://www.nature.com/"><I>Nature</I></A> by <A
HREF="http://psy.ucsd.edu./faculty_p/ramachandran_v_p.html">Vilayanur S.
Ramachandran</A> and <A
HREF="http://psy.ucsd.edu./faculty_p/rogers-ramachandran_d_p.html">Diane
C. Rogers-Ramachandran</A>, a husband-and-wife team, involved three women,
two 77 years old and one 78 years old. All were paralyzed on their left
sides and hence confined to wheelchairs, as a result of strokes.
        
<P>Ramachandran claims that the women were all mentally lucid, able to
converse fluently and to perform simple arithmetic operations. The
researchers asked them a series of questions to test the nature of their
anosognosia: Can you walk? Can you use both hands? Can you use your right
hand? Can you use your left hand? Are both hands equally strong? The three
women answered all these questions affirmatively, even when they were
sitting in front of a mirror that belied their answers.
        
<P>The U.C.S.D. scientists then asked the women to observe another person
exhibiting left hemiplegia. (In one case, the researchers presented a
healthy male student who pretended to be paralyzed.) The investigators
first established that this person, whom they called the "stooge," was
unable to respond to commands to move his left arm. They then asked the
original subjects whether the stooge was moving his arm properly or was
paralyzed.
        
<P>One woman, seemingly surprised at the question, answered that "of course
he is paralyzed; he is not moving his arm." The other two women, however,
answered without hesitation that the man was "OK" and was "moving his arm
up and down." The awareness of anosognosic patients, Ramachandran
comments, "is completely warped to accommodate the strange new sensory
world they inhabit." 
        
<P>Previous workers have proposed that each individual's brain has a specific
neural region that contains a schema, or representation, of the
individual's body. According to this model, anosognosia occurs when brain
damage prevents new sensory data from being integrated into the schema.
The schema hypothesis might also explain the "phantom limb" phenomena that
often occur after spinal injury or amputation, which involve tactile
rather than visual hallucinations about the body.
        
<P>The Ramachandrans speculate that this same region of the brain may contain
representations of other persons' bodies as well. (The fact that one of
patients perceived the stooge's paralysis correctly suggests, however,
that the regions do not completely overlap.) Experiments on monkeys,
described two years ago in <A
HREF="http://science-mag.aaas.org/science/home/browse.shtml"><I>Science</I></A>
(Michael S. A. Graziano et al., Vol. 266, pages 1054-1057; November 11,
1994), support this hypothesis. The researchers discovered that the neural
cells in the monkeys' frontal lobes that fire when the animals perform
certain functions also show activity when they watch other monkeys perform
the same function. This work suggests a new twist on the old <A
HREF="http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/Mind/Table.html">mind-body problem</A>;
our bodies are, in a sense, self-projected constructs, an integral part of
our minds.
<P>Ramachandran is designing new experiments to test whether anosognosia can
be overcome by other mental functions. In one preliminary result, he found
that an anosognosic patient would acknowledge her paralysis if he injected
her left arm with an inert saline solution but told her it was a
paralyzing anesthetic. Studying such syndromes, Ramachandran explains, can
yield insights into ancient questions about how we obtain knowledge of the
world and represent it in our brains. "We call this field 'experimental
epistemology,' just to annoy the philosophers," he says.

<P>The subatomic world, where particles are not solid objects so much as smears
of probability, may seem counterintuitive, even illogical. But since the
early 1980s, a number of scientists (starting with the late <A
HREF="http://www.mindspring.com/~madpickl/feyn.htm">Richard Feynman</A>)
have been thinking through schemes to exploit the oddball laws of quantum
physics to rational ends; their goal is to create a radically new kind of
computer, one far smaller and swifter than any modern silicon device. Though
a functional <A
HREF="http://web.mit.edu/org/m/mathdept/www/AppliedMathColloq/spring96/shor.html">"quantum
computer"</A> still lies <A
HREF="http://feynman.stanford.edu/qcomp/divincenzo/gate/node3.html#SECTION00021000000000000000">beyond
the grasp of current technology</A>, a succession of theoretical and
practical advances suggests some heartening progress toward that goal. 
<P>In a quantum computer, information is stored not as a string of ones and
zeroes, but as a series of quantum-mechanical states: spin directions of
electrons, for instance, or polarization orientations of a photon. In 1985
David Deutsch of the University of Oxford pointed out that quantum physical
law allows particles to be in more than one state at a time, making it
possible for each particle in a quantum computer to hold more than one bit
of information. (In this field, the term "bit" is replaced by "qubit,"
meaning quantum bit.) A computer containing, say, a hundred particles could
execute a computation on 2<SUP>100</SUP> numbers at once.  The ability to crunch
many numbers at the same time--known as massive parallelism--would make
quantum computers ideal for some basic computing tasks, such as factoring
large numbers. Two years ago, <A
HREF="http://netlib.bell-labs.com/netlib/att/math/people/shor/index.html">Peter
W. Shor</A> of AT&T Bell Labs <A
HREF="http://netlib.bell-labs.com/netlib/att/math/people/shor/papers/index.html">presented
an algorithm</A> showing exactly how a quantum computer would carry out such
task.
<P>But there is much more to quantum computers than breaking down large
numbers. At last May's <A
HREF="http://theory.lcs.mit.edu/~dmjones/STOC/">ACM Symposium on Theory of
Computing</A>, Lov K. Grover, also at Bell Labs, announced <A
HREF="http://theory.lcs.mit.edu/~dmjones/STOC/Authors/groverlovk.html">a
more down-to-earth application</A>: a crafty algorithm that, building on
Shor's ideas, would allow a quantum computer to make lightning-fast searches
through a database. In this scheme, each item in the database would be
represented by a quantum state of a particle in the computer. Relying on the
inherently fuzzy laws governing those particles, Grover's algorithm would
enhance the state in the system corresponding to the desired item and
suppress the others. Rather than slogging dumbly through a list, the
algorithm operates on all of the particles at once, so it could far exceed
the speed and efficiency of a classical computer. 
<P>Such list-searching ability could have applications in many other tasks that
require finding the optimal member of a set. And a combined talent for
factoring and searching may make quantum computers ideal tools for cracking
codes (including the <A
HREF="http://www.rsa.com/rsalabs/faq/faq_des.html">Data Encryption
Standard</A>, the official U.S. government cryptographic standard).
<P>Another exciting role for quantum computers involves turning them back on
their own world and using them to simulate other quantum-mechanical
systems--the behavior of quarks in an atomic nucleus, for instance, or
electrons in a superconductor. <A
HREF="http://me.mit.edu/people/faculty/SethLloyd.html">Seth Lloyd</A> of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology is one of the leading researchers
working on concrete ways to realize this exotic idea. In essence, the
quantum behavior of one set of particles would act as a proxy for that of a
different system, bypassing the extraordinarily complex rules of simulation
that normally would need to be programmed into a computer.
<P>While nobody is denying the vast potential of quantum computers, even the
most ardent enthusiasts are sobered by the obstacles that must be overcome
before usable devices can be built. The greatest of these is that the
slightest outside disruption--heat or light, for instance--can destroy the
balance of quantum states that stores information and makes the computing
possible. In technical terms, the system loses its quantum coherence. The
very process of reading the state of a qubit can upset the coherence, so
retrieving the result of a calculation poses a tough challenge. Even if the
system does not fall apart, quantum computers will naturally tend to
accumulate errors; the kinds of error-correction schemes developed for
classical computers do not translate to the subatomic realm.
<P>Here too, however, there has been substantial recent progress. Shor is
working on a method whereby each piece of information is spread, or
entangled, over several qubits. In this way, the erroneous decay of one of
the quantum states will not lose the information. Of course, using
additional qubits trades off some efficiency. Shor's original scheme
involved using nine qubits. More recently, <A
HREF="http://qso.lanl.gov/~laf/">Raymond Laflamme</A> and his colleagues at
Los Alamos National Laboratory have derived an error-correction technique
that requires only five qubits. Shor is also studying <A
HREF="http://vesta.physics.ucla.edu/~smolin/papers/syndrome.html">how much
error is allowable</A> before it taints the results from quantum computers;
in essence, proponents of quantum computing are trying to reinvent from the
ground up all of the basic logic problems that other computer scientists
have developed since the days of <A
HREF="http://homepage.seas.upenn.edu/~museum/">ENIAC</A>, the ancestor of
the modern electronic computer.
<P>And the programmers working on ENIAC had a significant advantage over Shor
and his ilk: they at least had a physical device to work with. Researchers
at the <A HREF="http://physics.nist.gov/">National Institute of Standards
and Technology</A>, led by <A
HREF="http://physics.nist.gov/StaffOrg/div847/group1.html">David J.
Wineland</A>, and a <A
HREF="http://www.cco.caltech.edu/~qoptics/people.html">team headed by H.
Jeff Kimble</A> at the California Institute of Technology have made some
headway in constructing <A
HREF="http://www.cco.caltech.edu/~qoptics/qcomp.html">real quantum
systems</A> that function as crude logic gates--sort of nano-transistors.
These are only the first baby steps toward a full, workable quantum
computer. 
<P>Nevertheless, many people are betting the technical hurdles are manageable.
Researchers at M.I.T., Caltech and the University of Southern California
have banded together to form the Quantum Information and Computing
institute. The <A HREF="http://www.arpa.mil/index.html">Defense Department's Advanced
Research Projects Agency</A> (ARPA) is providing a five-year, $5-million
grant--a skinny slice of the total defense R&D pie, but a sign of faith that quantum
computing will eventually find a place in our macroscopic lives.

<P>If one were to rank the world's most gruesome ways to die,
<A HREF="http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/diseases/virlfvr/ebolainf.htm">Ebola infection</A> 
would surely sit near the top of the list. It begins
with a sudden fever and then kills by liquefying peoples'
insides. Fifty to 90 percent of those who become ill, die,
making Ebola among <A HREF="http://www.ami-med.com/peds/top/001339.htm">the most lethal
viruses known</A>. Other diseases kill far larger numbers of people,
but Ebola's mystery and ferocity has come to symbolize the
growing risk from <A HREF="http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/publications/eid_plan/summary.htm">emerging and re-emerging pathogens</A>.
<P><A HREF="http://www.outbreak.org/cgi-unreg/dynaserve.exe/Ebola/history.html">
The two worst Ebola outbreaks</A> occurred in Zaire in 1976 and
<A HREF="http://www.who.ch/programmes/cds/ebupdate.html">1995</A>, with
almost no cases reported in between. (Some reserchers have even
speculated that the <A HREF="http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol2no2/olson.htm">"Plague of Athens"</A> that ended in 425 B.C. was an isolated Ebola epidemic.)
No one knows where the virus hides during its respites.
<P>In the
<A HREF="http://www.at-home.com/get_doc/215170/4329">April 16, issue</A> of
the <I>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, U.S.A.,</I>
Anthony Sanchez and his colleagues at the
<A HREF="http://www.cdc.gov/cdc.html">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</A> in
Atlanta report some notable progress in uncovering the genetic
mechanisms that make this microscopic monster tick.
<P>Virologists have classified <A HREF="http://life.anu.edu.au/viruses/Ictv/fs_filov.htm#Genus1">the four known
variants</A> of the Ebola virus (the Zaire, Sudan, Ivory Coast and Reston
strains) along with Marburg, a genetically related monkey virus,
into the genus <A HREF="http://www-micro.msb.le.ac.uk/335/Filoviruses.html">Filovirus.</A>
Sanchez's team analyzed certain key viral genes; using that
information, the researchers placed the filoviruses along a
phylogenetic tree, a branching diagram that shows the
evolutionary relationship between organisms. Each of the five
viruses occupies its own, genetically distinct branch. Sprouting
from these are evolutionary "twigs"--mini-strains into which the
Ebola variants are further divided.
<P>Such minor divergences are an inevitable result of mutations,
natural errors in the replication process. The big surprise
revealed in the Sanchez paper is just how tiny those twigs are.
Scientists had expected to see <A HREF="http://www.outbreak.org/cgi-unreg/dynaserve.exe/Ebola/genomic-differences.html">far more genetic heterogeneity in
each of the Ebola strains</A>, given the way that the viruses reproduce.
<P>In most higher organisms, the genetic material (DNA) proofreads
each replica to ensure that the genetic material in daughter
cells is exactly the same as in the parents. The story is
somewhat different for viruses. Take for example
<A HREF="http://www-medlib.med.utah.edu/WebPath/TUTORIAL/AIDS/HIV.html">HIV,</A>
the virus that causes AIDS. HIV is a retrovirus: the genetic
material within the virus is RNA, a simpler molecule that lacks
the double-helix structure of DNA. Once inside a host cell,
HIV's RNA is converted into DNA before the virus reproduces. In
this way, retroviruses too have proofreading abilities, but not
as effective as those in higher organisms.
<P>Filoviruses, however, reproduce as RNA; unlike HIV, they do not
have the ability to check each copy. Consequently, "the error
rate is one million fold greater than that of DNA based
systems," says Timothy Nichol, one of Sanchez's co-authors. To
find out how Ebola's penchant for mutation plays out in the real
world, the CDC researchers compared the Ebola strain captured
from the 1976 outbreak in Kikwit, Zaire, to one taken from the
1995 outbreak in Yambuku, Zaire. Even though, the two epidemics
occurred more than 1,000 kilometers apart, and the virus had 18
years to mutate, the genetic sequences of the two isolates of
Ebola-Zaire are virtually identical. In addition, Bernard
LeGuenno at <A HREF="http://www.pasteur.fr/welcome-uk.html">the Pasteur Institute</A> 
found that the recent 1996 outbreak of the Ebola-Zaire
strain in Gabon is also nearly identical to the 1976 isolate.
Something seems to be restraining the natural tendency of
filoviruses toward genetic divergence.
<P>Sanchez and his colleagues posit that, for the past 20 years,
Ebola-Zaire has essentially been most comfortable in its
original form--in other words, natural selection pressures have
favored the survival of the original strain over any mutants.
This penchant for the status quo lies in marked contrast to the
behavior of HIV. HIV also mutates as it reproduces (proofreading
is not foolproof), though not as readily as do filoviruses. But
because humans apply a selective force by attacking HIV with
drugs, the mutants that are, by chance, resistant will
proliferate.
<P>To determine the genetic distance between strains, Sanchez's
team focused their attention on the genes in which the viruses
differ the most. Since all Ebola strains are known to have
jumped species--from their presumed natural hosts to monkeys and
humans--the researchers predicted that the greatest variations
would occur among the genes which give the virus its ability to
recognize different cell species. In the case of Ebola, the most
relevant gene turned out to be the glycoprotein gene, which
produces proteins that sit on the virus's surface and are
thought to shuttle the virus inside the host cell. The CDC group
has since looked at other parts of the Ebola genome; so far, the
glycoprotein gene does in fact seem the most variable, Nichol
reports.
<P>Choosing to analyze the glycoprotein gene allowed an added
insight: it revealed that filoviruses, in addition to killing
their victims by destroying the cells they infect, might work by
suppressing the immune system. This may be one of the reasons
they are so deadly. Sanchez's team found that a section of the
filovirus glycoprotein gene is very similar to the corresponding
sections of the glycoprotein genes in other viruses whose
function is to subdue the immune system. Indeed, Ebola victims
usually die without evidence of an effective immune response.
<P>A related line of research concerns the search for an animal
"reservoir," the hiding place where the Ebola resides during the
long stretches between human outbreaks. Scientists don't yet
know in which creature or creatures Ebola lies dormant, but
groups from the <A HREF="http://www.cdc.gov/">CDC</A>, the
<A HREF="http://www.who.ch/">World Health Organization</A> and the U.S.
Army are all currently screening hundreds of African animal
species in search of the 
<A HREF="http://www.outbreak.org/cgi-unreg/dynaserve.exe/Ebola/enews.html#reservoir">reservoir</A>. Whatever it is, the high degree of similarity between
the 1976 and 1995 Ebola strains in Zaire (less than 1.6 percent
change in the studied RNA segments) suggests to the CDC team
that the reservoir is the same in both locations and that the
creature is either widespread in Zaire, or else is a migratory
species.
<P>On the other hand, the four Ebola strains, along with the
Marburg virus, show genetic divergences as great as 45 percent.
Such marked differences hint that the various filoviruses are
carried by more than one species. Each strain may have slowly
co-evolved to live comfortably with their own as yet unknown
hosts.
<P>Compared to other less spectacular but more widely distributed
illnesses such as <A HREF="http://www.who.ch/programmes/gtb/wtbday/facts_1e.htm">tuberculosis and hepatitis</A>, Ebola actually poses a rather limited threat:
precisely because it kills its victims so quickly, it cannot
easily spread. Yet all pathogens mutate, sometimes leading to
<A HREF="http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/aboutre.htm">the appearance of more pernicious versions</A> (as demonstrated by the emergence of
drug-resistant strains of TB). Virologists are continuing their
studies of the genetics of filoviruses, hoping to find a
treatment or a vaccine. But even if they ever do, the threat
that Ebola will reappear, like so many other pathogens, will
always remain.

"NEW HINT OF LIFE IN SPACE IS FOUND: Meteorites Yield Fossilized,
One-Cell Organisms Unlike Any Known on the Earth," shouted a
headline in "The New York Times." "Something Out There," chimed
in"Newsweek." Respected scientists told crowds of reporters that
their work, published in a prestigious journal, revealed complex
hydrocarbons and what looked like fossilized bacteria buried deep
within a meteorite. This, they claimed, provided "the first
physical evidence for the existence of forms of life beyond our
planet."<P>
That was 1961. And the meteorite in question was not the
<A HREF="http://www-sn.jsc.nasa.gov/planetscience/marsmet/text.htm">one
from Mars</A> that has made recent headlines but another that had
fallen a century earlier in Orgueil, France. Under closer
scrutiny, the astonishing evidence was eventually thrown out of
the court of scientific opinion. The organic chemicals and
"fossils" turned out to be ragweed pollen and furnace ash. <P>
So it is with understandable skepticism that scientists are
greeting the bold assertions, made by
<A HREF="http://ilewg.jsc.nasa.gov/register/dmckay/bio.htm">David S.
McKay</A> of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
Johnson Space Center and eight colleagues, that the peculiar
features they found in meteorite
<A HREF="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/snc/alh.html">ALH84001</A> are best
explained by the existence of primitive life on early Mars.
Despite public enthusiam about the conclusions, published in
<A
HREF="http://science-mag.aaas.org/science/scripts/display/short/273/5277/924.html"><I>Science</I></A>,
many leading researchers who study meteorites and ancient life
have weighed the evidence and found it unconvincing. "There are
nonbiological interpretations of McKay's data that are much more
likely," says
<A HREF="http://www.uark.edu/depts/cheminfo/uarkchem/dsears.html">Derek
Sears</A>, editor of the journal
<A HREF="http://www.uark.edu/meteor/"><I>Meteoritics and Planetary
Science.</I></A><P>
On August 7 the nightly news recounted ALH84001Us impressive
resume: born 4.5 billion years ago in Mars's depths; splashed by
a huge impact into interplanetary space to drift for 16 million
years; captured in Earth's gravity and dragged into Antarctic
snow; buried in ice for 10 to 20 millennia until 1984, when
meteorite hunters, trudging seven abreast across the Allan Hills
ice flow, picked it up and made it famous. That much nearly
everyone agrees on; the controversy centers on the rock's less
glamorous inside story.<P>
McKay and his collaborators build the case for life on four lines
of evidence. The first are
<A HREF="http://science-mag.aaas.org/science/scripts/display/full/273/5277/924/F2.htm">orangish
blobs</A>, no bigger than periods, that dot the walls of the cracks
and crevices perforating the meteorite's shiny crust. These
multilayered formations, called carbonate rosettes, tend to have
cores rich in manganese, surrounded by alternating iron- and
magnesium-enhanced layers and a rind consisting primarily of
magnetite. Bacteria in ponds can produce similar rosettes as they
metabolize minerals. But "that is a perfectly reasonable sequence
to find in a changing chemical environment as well," counters
Kenneth Nealson, a biologist at the
<A HREF="http://www.wisc.edu/">University of Wisconsin</A>, who was one
of the paper's peer reviewers.<P>
The second line of evidence centers on the discovery of organic
compounds called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, or PAHs, in
and around the carbonate.
<A HREF="http://www-chem.stanford.edu/faculty/zare/">Richard N. Zare</A>, a
Stanford University chemist and co-author of the <I>Science</I>
paper, reports that the rock contains an unusual mixture of
certain lightweight PAHs. "In conjunction with all the other
data, it seems most likely to me that they all came from the
breakdown products of something that was once alive," he says.<P>
Critics suggest other possible explanations, however.
"Hydrothermal synthesis could take inorganic carbon and water and
make aromatic organics; you would get the same ones they report,"
points out Bernd Simoneit, a chemist at
<A HREF="http://www.orst.edu/">Oregon State University</A>. "And look at the
Murchison meteorite, thought to come from the asteroid belt,"
adds <A HREF="http://epsc.wustl.edu/people/shock.html">Everett Shock</A> of
Washington University. "Hundreds of organic compounds have been
identified in it, including amino acids and compounds closer to
the things organisms actually use. It has carbonate minerals in
it, too--and real solid evidence of water--yet there isn't
anybody saying that there is life in the asteroid belt."<P>
Training high-power electron microscopes on ALH84001, McKayUs
group found its third and most cogent bit of evidence: tiny,
teardrop-shaped crystals of magnetite and iron sulfide are
embedded in places where the carbonate is dissolved, presumably
by some sort of acid. The authors note that certain bacteria
manufacture broadly similar magnetite and iron sulfide crystals.
<A HREF="http://www.gps.caltech.edu/faculty/kirschvink/kirschvink.html">Joseph
Kirschvink</A>, a biomineralogist at the California Institute of
Technology, agrees that the mineral formations are intriguing.
"If it is not biology, I am at a loss to explain what the hell is
going on," he says. "I don't know of anything else that can make
crystals like that." Shock remains unconvinced. "There are other
ways to get those shapes. And in any case," he continues, "shape
is one of the worst things you can use in geology to define
things."<P>
<TABLE ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=140>

WIDTH="100" HEIGHT="75" BORDER="0"><BR><FONT

</TABLE>
The final thread of evidence is the one that has drawn the
sharpest attacks from skeptics. Examining bits of ALH84001 under
an electron microscope, McKay's team found provocative, elongated
and egg-shaped structures within the carbonate; the researchers
interpreted these as likely fossilized microorganisms. Many
scientists are still unconvinced that such organisms ever existed
on Earth, let alone anywhere else. There is also a real danger of
an observer effect at work.<P>
"The problem," says NASA exobiologist Jack Farmer, "is that at
that scale of just tens of nanometers, minerals can grow into
shapes that are virtually impossible to distinguish from
nanofossils." Nealson moans that "I'd get drummed out of the
microbiological society if I showed pictures like that and
claimed I had bacteria." But Everett Gibson of the NASA Johnson
Space Center, another of McKay's co-authors, responds that "we
eliminated that possibility for most of our examples by noting
the lack of crystal growth faces" and other mineralogical
features. McKay adds that he looked at a different meteorite as a
control and saw no similar formations.<P>
Some critics also find the small size of the "fossils" hard to
square with the other evidence. "These structures contain one
one-thousandth the volume of the smallest terrestrial bacteria,"
points out <A HREF="http://www.life.uiuc.edu/Micro/woese.html">Carl R.
Woese</A> of the University of Illinois, who studies the biochemistry
of ancient life. "They really press the lower limit," he says, of
how tiny a living unit can be. (But
<A HREF="http://checfs1.ucsd.edu/~nscort/Research/Miller/miller_research.html">Stanley
Miller</A> of the University of California at San Diego, himself a
doubter, asks, "Who knows how much space you really need?")
Moreover, the putative Martian bacteria are hardly larger than
the mineral crystals they are supposed to have produced.
"Magnetic bacteria are mobile; they swim," Kirschvink adds.
"That's why magnetic orientation is selective--it aids
navigation. But these nannobacteria are too small to contain
enough magnetite to make them align properly to the magnetic
field."<P>
If not life, then what can account for this odd collection of
features? One possibility is a hydrothermal process. "Imagine hot
fluids flowing through the crust," suggests John F. Kerridge, a
planetary scientist at the University of California in San Diego.
"The crystallization of magnetite, iron sulfides and carbonate
with a change in the chemistry over time is perfectly reasonable.
If anywhere in the subsurface of Mars there are PAHs, then they
would be carried by this fluid and deposited where the fluids
crystallize. I think the nanostructures are most likely an
unusual surface texture resulting from the way in which the
carbonate crystallized."<P>
Then there is the specter of contamination during the meteorite's
long residence in the Antarctic.
<A HREF="http://checfs1.ucsd.edu/~nscort/Research/Bada/bada_research.html">Jeffrey
Bada</A> of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla,
Calif., notes that PAHs have been found in glacial ice, albeit at
very low concentrations; when he analyzed a different Martian
meteorite, he found that terrestrial amino acids had worked their
way into the rock. McKay and his colleagues tried to avoid being
fooled by contaminants by running the same tests on several
Antarctic meteorites. They showed, among other things, that
nothing was living inside ALH84001 at the time it was analyzed,
that most (but not all) of the carbonates harbored isotopes
associated with Mars and that PAHs were more concentrated inside
the rock than on its surface. "These arguments are flaky and
simplistic," Sears rebuts. "Weathering is a sloppy process.
Things leach in, then leach out; they do not do the obvious. The
chemistry of the water can change."<P>
A number of scientists also fret that the attention given to the
McKay paper could ultimately prove counterproductive. "I'm really
somewhat taken aback by the hullabaloo," Bada says. "If it turns
out to be wrong, a lot of people are going to be very
disappointed. And it will take an ongoing effort for a decade or
more before we sort it out."<P>
That endeavor is already under way. Researchers in many
disciplines are scrambling to obtain pieces of ALH84001 and the
11 other meteorites identified as being of Martian origin in
order to run further tests. Zare says he wants to search for
amino acids and to compare the carbon 13 in the PAHs with that of
Mars--work that some feel he should have done before going public
with his results. McKay has talked about obtaining electron
micrographs of thin sections of the nanofossils to look for cell
walls and internal structure, but such efforts will push the
limits of present technology.<P>
Nealson and others insist that the only way to prove beyond doubt
that something once lived on Mars is to send a robotic probe to
Mars to deliver rocks back to Earth--another daunting technical
challenge. NASA plans to launch two probes later this year, but
the agency did not envision a sample-return mission until 2005,
although NASA administrator
<A HREF="http://www.npr.gov/NPR_AnnualRep/Bios/goldin.html">Daniel S.
Goldin</A> recently spoke of accelerating the schedule. Also, a
committee chaired by
<A HREF="http://ilewg.jsc.nasa.gov/register/greeley/bio.htm">Ronald
Greeley</A> of Arizona State University has warned that tight budgets
are slowing the development of the rovers and drilling equipment
needed to search for Martian fossils or subsurface life.<P>
Beneath all these thoughts lies a nagging question: Will we even
know life if we see it? Some unconventional thinkers such as
<A HREF="http://www.library.wisc.edu/libraries/College/circreserve/ereserves/biocore/deephot/deephot.htm">Thomas
Gold</A> of Cornell University and English astronomer
<A HREF="http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~eww/bios/Hoyle.html">Fred Hoyle</A>
have suggested that life may exist in unlikely environments, such
as cometary nuclei or the crust of the moon. Even identifying
carbon-based life is ferociously difficult--what if some life
follows unconventional chemistries? "It boggles the mind to think
of these questions," reflects Miller. "You have to stick with
what you know; the alternative is sitting around, looking at your
navel."<P>
If the results reported by McKay's group hold up, Miller suspects
it will be just the tip of the iceberg. "My impression is that
bacterial life exists on planets around one in 10 stars, maybe
more," he speculates. "I would view life on Mars not as a
surprise but as a new frontier."<P>

As bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or <A
HREF="http://www.wvu.edu/~agexten/v1i1/q_a.htm">BSE</A>, it was a mysterious
malady that caused brain degeneration among cows. As "mad cow disease" prevalent
in British herds, it prompted concerns about unhealthy cattle feeding practices.
But this past March, when an advisory committee to the British Parliament <A
HREF="http://www.open.gov.uk/maff/bse/seac1.htm">declared</A> that BSE might be
able to jump the species barrier and cause <A
HREF="http://www.cjd.ed.ac.uk/intro.htm">Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease</A> (CJD), a
rare but horrifying brain disorder among humans, it became the stuff of
hysterical talk shows. <A
HREF="http://muu.lib.hel.fi/McSpotlight/media/television/oprah_transcript.html">
Oprah Winfrey</A> described BSE as "a medical mystery spreading panic across the
Atlantic." The true extent of the risk remains murky, however, as researchers
know frustratingly little about how BSE works.<P>
So it came as relatively little surprise to most scientists working in the field
when the European Union announced on July 23 that BSE can be transmitted from
cows to sheep. Indeed, there was already good reason to think that the disorder
could travel in the other direction. One of the best guesses for the origin of
BSE, which has affected close to 200,000 animals in England and Europe, is that
it arose when cows ate feed supplemented with the brains and spinal cords of
sheep infected with <A
HREF="http://zenith.berkeley.edu/seidel/docs/scrapie_doc.html ">scrapie</A>.
(Strange though it may sound, such use of animal by-products in cattle feed was
common practice in the U.K.) Scrapie, a degenerative brain disease, has been
known to sheep farmers for at least 250 years; its symptoms are much like those
of BSE. Moreover, BSE -- or something remarkably similar to it -- has also
appeared in pigs, cats and several zoo animals whose diet was augmented with
cow-derived protein.<P>
Then again, researchers probably would not have been surprised if BSE had proven
harmless to sheep. Scrapie manifests itself in a number of different strains. The
specific version of the disease that is able to infect cows might well be
expected to be innocuous to its original host -- after all, the genetic
differences between species are usually sufficient to halt the spread of
infectious agents. And cows injected with scrapie agent do not develop the
typical symptoms of BSE. Such conflicting findings give a sense of the confusion
that still surrounds a field in which simple tests of contagion may take three to
five years to carry out.<P>
Molecular biologists continue to search for an understanding of BSE's mechanism
of action. Even the precise identity of the infectious agent is unknown. Many
scientists pin the blame on <A
HREF="http://w3.aces.uiuc.edu/ansci/bse/bse2.htm#att1">prions</A>, a peculiar
class of aberrant proteins that, unlike familiar pathogens, contain no genetic
material at all. But information about how prions cause disease -- or even
whether they truly exist -- remains elusive.<P>
<TABLE ALIGN=RIGHT><TR><TD><IMG SRC="IMG/081296explorations.gif" BORDER=0><TR><TH><A
HREF="081296explorations2.html">Infected Brain</A></TABLE>Meanwhile, human
carnivores wait with apprehension for confirmation that there exists a type of
BSE that attacks them. The March declaration by the British Parliament was
prompted by reports of a dozen cases of <A
HREF="http://www.cjd.ed.ac.uk/lancet.htm">"atypical"</A> Creutzfeld-Jakob
disease, a deadly neurological ailment whose symptoms resemble those of BSE and
scrapie. CJD, which was first recognized about a century ago, primarily kills
people over age 45.<P>
Atypical CJD causes a different pattern of brain damage than usual, and the 10
instances thus far reported in the U.K. have occurred among people in their teens
and twenties. Responding to the possibility that this variant is a human version
of BSE, the British government banned any use of potentially infectious cow,
sheep and goat parts at the end of May.<P>
Both BSE and atypical CJD appear to be spreading. Although the annual number of
new "mad cow" cases in the U.K. is down by more than half from its peak of 37,000
in 1992, farmers in continental Europe, who had once thought that their herds
remained untouched, have now reported several dozen cases of BSE. B.E.C.
Schreuder of the <A HREF="http://www.bib.wau.nl/dlo/">DLO-Institute for Animal
Science and Health</A> in Lelystad, the Netherlands, estimates the true number to
be more like a couple thousand cases. Young adults with brain lesions almost
identical to those of their British counterparts have reportedly died in both
France and Germany. Even more troubling are anecdotal reports of an increasing
prevalence of CJD in the U.S., where BSE has yet to be confirmed in any animals.
One report from Oregon counted 50 cases of CJD during a five-year period among a
population in which only 12 or 13 cases would have been expected.<P>
There is no direct evidence, however, that the new human disease -- if there even
is one -- is actually linked to the British epidemic of BSE. The agent
responsible for BSE has yet to be identified with certainty, so detecting it in
humans is problematic. Furthermore, the amounts of beef that the CJD victims
consumed varied wildly, and cooking the meat may or may not affect the spread of
BSE. And the number of atypical CJD cases is still a small fraction of the number
of typical CJD deaths: researchers examined more than 100 diseased brains in the
process of confirming the dozen victims. Meanwhile, no one has any idea whether
the kinds of cooking that various cuts of beef undergo might affect their
putative infectivity.<P>
Most references quote the <A HREF="http://www.cjd.ed.ac.uk/euro.htm">annual
incidence</A> of "typical" CJD at one case per million people each year, but no
one knows the real numbers. In the U.S, for example, there is no active
surveillance for the disease. Statisticians simply count up the number of times
it appears on death certificates -- about 250 in an average year. Because CJD can
only be diagnosed with certainty by sectioning the brain after death (its
symptoms are broadly similar to those of <A
HREF="http://noah.cuny.edu/wellconn/alzheimers.html">Alzheimer's disease</A>),
there is a significant chance for undercounting or overcounting, depending on how
officiously doctors fill out their former patients' paperwork. Since the late
1980s, neurologists everywhere have had mad cow disease on the brain, and it
takes only a tiny increase in the number of people diagnosed with CJD to yield a
big jump in the statistics.<P>
The British government established a special reporting system for CJD in 1990,
after the potential dangers of BSE became apparent, but the resulting disease
statistics will be difficult to compare with those from other countries or with
earlier figures from the U.K. Until researchers unravel the <A
HREF="http://whyfiles.news.wisc.edu/012mad_cow/prion.html">mechanism</A> of the
agent behind BSE and related diseases in other animal -- or, more grimly, until
far more people start dying -- it will be impossible to determine whether
meat-eating humans are at the same risk as meat-eating cows. In the meantime,
hold off on the breaded calves' brains.<P>

"I have heard the mermaids singing," the poet T. S. Eliot wrote. "Yes,
but we have heard the sun's soft ringing," might be the reply of
astronomers such as Douglas O. Gough of the University of Cambridge.
Gough is a pioneer in the emerging field of <A
HREF="http://helios.tuc.noao.edu/helio.html">helioseismology.</A><P>
Over the past two decades, scientists have slowly learned to read the
subtle acoustic oscillations of the sun--analogous to the tones and
overtones of a clanging bell--to probe the unseen interior structure
of our nearest star. The effort has just received a tremendous boost
from two new experiments, the ground-based <A
HREF="http://helios.tuc.noao.edu/fact_sheet.html">Global Oscillation
Network Group</A> (GONG) and instruments on the space-faring <A
HREF="http://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov/descriptions/mission/english/">Solar
and Heliospheric Observatory</A> (SOHO). A flurry of press releases,
presentations and a special section of papers in the <A
HREF="http://science-mag.aaas.org/science/content/vol272/issue5266/">May
31, 1996 issue of Science</A> documents how helioseismology has
finally achieved the unthinkable: a comprehensive understanding of the
invisible structure and processes deep inside the sun.<P>
GONG consists of identical observatories at <A
HREF="http://helios.tuc.noao.edu/new/sites.html">six locations</A>
around the world; they began active duty in October 1995. SOHO is even
younger, having been launched in December, 1995. The oscillations that
these experiments seek out are extremely subtle. A typical acoustic
wave produces a velocity change on the order of one centimeter per
second, superimposed on the overall roiling of the 6,000-degree
Celsius solar surface; the oscillations have periods ranging from
minutes to hours.<P>
These motions can be detected by the way they change the wavelength of
the light emitted by the sun (a phenomenon known as the <A
HREF="http://zebu.uoregon.edu/%7Esoper/Light/doppler.html">Doppler
shift</A>). It is also possible to detect the variations in the local
brightness of the sun induced by acoustic waves; these, too, are
minuscule, roughly one part in 10 million. <A
HREF="http://science-mag.aaas.org/science/scripts/display/short/272/5266/1281.html">Gough
notes</A> that even in the late 1970s, many astronomers scoffed at the
notion that helioseismology could produce any usable information about
the sun's interior. Yet now astronomers can confidently describe the
density and pressure throughout the sun to an accuracy of 1
percent.<P>
And helioseismology can do much more than paint a general picture of
the physical state of the sun. It also allows unprecedented insight
into how stars shine. In one early triumph, <A
HREF="http://quake.stanford.edu/%7Eduvall/duvall.html">T. L.
Duvall</A>, of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
Goddard Space Flight Center deduced that the solar interior must be
significantly more opaque than expected at temperatures of between two
million and four million degrees C--a fundamental high-temperature
physics discovery that would be nearly impossible to make in the
laboratory. Such information has led astronomers to revise their
models of how energy from the nuclear reactions in the core of the sun
wends its way to the surface.<P>
More detailed knowledge of the solar interior has actually deepened
some other scientific mysteries. For nearly 25 years, scientists have
noted the flux of neutrinos (uncharged, nearly massless particles
created as a by-product of nuclear fusion) from the sun is <A
HREF="http://www.sciam.com/WEB/askexpert/expertarchive1.html#q16">significantly
less</A> than expected. Either something is missing from our theories
of particle physics, or else the interior of the sun, where fusion
takes place, has different properties than researchers have assumed.
Helioseismology makes it possible to examine the physical conditions
deep inside the sun; <A
HREF="http://bigcat.obs.aau.dk/%7Ejcd/">J&#248;rgen
Christensen-Dalsgaard</A> of &#197;rhus University in Denmark reports
<A
HREF="http://science-mag.aaas.org/science/scripts/display/short/272/5266/1286.html">elsewhere
in Science</A> that the GONG results "suggest that no solution of the
neutrino problem can be found by modifying the computation of solar
models." This is an exciting finding for physicists, one that affirms
other indications of the existence of a fundamentally new process
affecting subatomic particles.<P>
Seismic studies also offer a look into the distant future of the sun.
In a few billion years, the sun will exhaust the hydrogen fuel in its
core, triggering a sequence of events that will eventually lead to its
death as a collapsed white dwarf. Exactly when that will happen
depends on the amount of mixing that occurs between the solar core and
its outer layers: the more mixing, the longer the sun's life (because
more hydrogen can find its way to the central nuclear fires). Gough
and a large team of co-authors <A
HREF="http://science-mag.aaas.org/science/scripts/display/short/272/5266/1296.html">report
finding hints</A> in the GONG data that the amount of mixing may be
greater than generally thought. That may be good news for those of us
inhabiting the earth, but it could spell trouble for cosmology.
Already the age of the oldest stars is uncomfortably close to the
estimated age of the universe itself. If stars actually age more
slowly than expected, scientists may have a full-blown paradox on
their hands.<P>
One of the great advantages of GONG and SOHO over earlier instruments
is that they allow continuous coverage of the sun: GONG's eyes are
spaced across the globe, and SOHO orbits the sun far from the earth,
where it never plunges into night. That continuity allows the
collection of extremely accurate data on the very subtle acoustic
oscillations that probe deep into the sun. <A
HREF="http://www.maths.qmw.ac.uk/%7Ewww/astro/personnel/mjt.html">M.
J. Thompson</A> of the University of London and his colleagues have
used these data to explore the way that the <A
HREF="http://science-mag.aaas.org/science/scripts/display/short/272/5266/1300.html">interior
of the sun</A> rotates. Astronomers had long assumed that the dense
core of the sun rotates more quickly than its outer layers, in part a
relic of the early days when the sun (like most young stars) was a
fast spinner. GONG has shown that assumption to be wrong, raising new
questions about how stars lose their angular momentum. (Incidentally,
it is a good thing that they do; fast-rotating stars produce powerful
flares and other outbursts that could be devastating to life-forms
like us.)<P>
Helioseismology is still a young field, so it is not surprising that
so many questions remain to be answered. GONG will provide years of
uninterrupted solar observations, which may illuminate the poorly
understood mechanism that causes the 11-year cycle of solar activity.
Working with just four months of data, a SOHO team led by David H.
Hathaway of the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center has already <A
HREF="http://wwwssl.msfc.nasa.gov/ssl/pad/solar/flows.html">detected
huge convective flows</A> in the solar surface.<P>
Further down the road, SOHO's remarkable precision should ultimately
allow scientists to observe an even more delicate kind of solar
oscillation: buoyancy waves, which can penetrate to the very heart of
the sun's energy-producing core. Such a detection may still be year
away. But even now, astronomers are marveling at the clarity with
which they can hear the sun ringing out its innermost secrets.<P>

The fossil record is notoriously stingy in doling out clues about the
history of life. Biologists agonize over whether they are inferring a
distorted view of the past from the bits of bone that they pluck from
the vast expanse of the earth's accumulated sediments. But because <A
HREF=
"http://www-geology.ucdavis.edu/www/classes/GEL107/speciation.html">evolution
proceeds so slowly</A>, scientists cannot test their ideas by watching
it unfold in real time.<P>
Or can they? In an ingenious experiment conducted at <A
HREF="http://poultry.mph.msu.edu/www-mic.html">Michigan State
University</A>, researchers have observed evolutionary changes as a
family of bacteria passed through 3,000 generations. The procedure
took a mere four years; conducting an analogous experiment with Homo
sapiens would require roughly 60,000 years, a timeline too long for
most granting agencies. The Michigan State researchers reported in the
<A HREF=
"http://science-mag.aaas.org/science/scripts/display/short/272/5269/1802.h
tml">June 21 issue of Science</A> that their observations support a
provocative evolutionary theory called punctuated equilibrium, often
known by its nickname "punk eek."<P>
Punctuated equilibrium was proposed in 1972 by Stephen Jay Gould of
Harvard University and Niles Eldredge of the <A HREF= "
http://www.amnh.org/">American Museum of Natural History</A>. Gould
and Eldredge challenged the traditional view of Darwinian evolution as
a gradual, stately unfolding. <A
HREF="http://userwww.sfsu.edu/~rsauzier/Darwin.html">Charles
Darwin</A> himself had fretted over the <A HREF=
"http://atlantis.colorado.edu/~greig/darwin_punkeek.html">gaps</A>
separating different species. But he hoped that eventually those gaps
would be filled in by new fossil discoveries, showing how natural
selection gradually transformed one species into another.<P>
Gould and Eldredge noted that most of those gaps have persisted during
the century following the publication of Darwin's <A HREF=
"http://www.emergentmedia.com/~madsen/origin/intro.html">On the Origin
of Species</A>. The fossil record still shows species persisting
unaltered for eons before giving rise to new species in the blink of
an eye, geologically speaking. Gould and Eldredge argued that those
apparent sudden changes should be taken at face value. They proposed
that species experience long stretches of general stasis, interrupted
by the abrupt emergence of new evolutionary forms over relatively few
generations.<P>
Punk eek has had its ups and downs. After an enthusiastic reception by
journalists and some scientists, the theory was seized on by <A HREF=
"http://weber.ucsd.edu/~dlane/create.html">creationists</A> as a sign
that the theory of evolution was not universally accepted. Gould and
Eldredge retorted that their model does not deny evolution but merely
offers an alternative description of how it occurs.<P>
Since then, evolutionary biologists have debated the theory's validity
without coming to a resolution. In a retrospective article published
three years ago in <A HREF= "http://www.nature.com">Nature</A>, Gould
and Eldredge acknowledged that their model was merely one of many
recent ideas in science that emphasize the role of discontinuity and
randomness in nature. "We have either been toadies and panderers to
fashion, and therefore destined for history's ashheap, or we had a
spark of insight about nature's constitution," they wrote.<P>
The recent studies by the Michigan State team may help tip the balance
toward the latter view. <A HREF=
"http://poultry.mph.msu.edu/facpages/lenski.html">Richard E.
Lenski</A>, Santiago F. Elena and Vaughn S. Cooper carried out their
evolutionary tests on the favorite guinea pig of microbiologists, the
intestinal bacterium <A HREF=
"http://www.wsu.edu:8080/~hurlbert/pages/chapter3.html#Bacterial_morphology">Escherichia
coli</A>. By restricting the amount of nutrients available to the
bacteria, the investigators increased the competition among them and
thus the pressure of natural selection. To make matters more
interesting, however, the researchers worked only with a variant of E.
coli that cannot swap genetic material with other simple cells, as
many bacteria can. Unable to borrow useful genes, the studied bacteria
could evolve only through random genetic mutations.<P>
During the experiment, the workers gathered samples every 15 days and
measured the microbes' average size. Previous work had suggested that
larger bacteria can survive more readily than smaller ones in a
low-nutrient environment. For the first few hundred generations (each
of which may last just a few hours), the organisms showed little or no
change, but then their average size suddenly shot up by almost 30
percent. Another period of stasis then gave way to another upward
surge in size. Finally, thousands of generations passed without any
further bursts in microbial bulk.<P>
The researchers calculated that millions of bacterial mutations must
have occurred over the course their experiment. But only very
infrequently did a mutation emerge that significantly boosted the E.
coli's fitness, or ability to survive. Lenski's group concluded that
the sudden surges in size occur when those "rare, beneficial mutations
sweep successively through the population." Once the mutation takes
hold, the population returns to equilibrium again as it "awaits" yet
another mutation.<P>
Critics have objected that the jerky pattern of size increases
observed by the Michigan State group results from examining evolution
on too fine a scale. According to the opposing view, less frequent
sampling of the bacterial population would have shown evolutionary
growth more consonant with the traditional, gradualist conception.
Eldredge himself cautions that the punctuated equilibrium was intended
to explain the evolution of multicellular, sexually reproducing
animals. The processes underlying bacterial evolution are quite
different, he points out.<P>
The Michigan State team acknowledges that its experimental approach is
far from perfect. On the other hand, so is the fossil record. "We are
testing important questions in evolutionary theory," Elena says,
"using a simple system that has a large population size and short
generations." The researchers now intend to analyze the DNA of
successive generations of E. coli to determine what genetic mutations
corresponded to the sudden plumping up of their subjects. With luck,
Cooper adds, these experiments will illuminate "how microevolutionary
processes may impinge on macroevolutionary trends."<P>

The battle against disease is not unlike the mythical task of <A
HREF="http://www.windsor.k12.vt.us/myth/Sisyphus.html">Sisyphus:</A>
always uphill and never-ending. Despite the impressive array of
modern medicines, new diseases create a constant need for novel
cures, even as familiar microbes such as the <A
HREF="http://www.cpmc.columbia.edu/tbcpp/">tuberculosis
bacillus</A> are evolving resistance to some widely used
compounds. <P>
At the same time, the pace of discovery of new drugs derived from
living organisms has slowed since the1970s; most of the natural
biologically active compounds flagged in screening programs these
days turn out to be molecules that are already known.
Pharmaceutical companies are therefore excited about an
innovative technique for producing complex molecules not known in
nature, compounds that might form the basis of next century's
drugs. <P>
One versatile approach for quickly creating novel compounds,
known as <A HREF="http://edisto.awod.com/netsci/Issues/July95/feature2.html">combinatorial
chemistry</A>, assembles molecules from simple entities (see
"Cracking the Combination," by Gary Stix, in Scientific
American's <A HREF="http://www.sciam.com/WEB/explorations/060396explorations.html">Explorations</A>).
Unfortunately, many drugs have structures so complex that they
would be beyond the reach of present combinatorial methods.
Hence, the mounting interest in a more subtle
technique--engineered biosynthesis--which presses enzymes and
microbes into service as assemblers of candidate pharmaceuticals.
<P>
Breakthroughs in the past two years have propelled engineered
biosynthesis from an esoteric area of basic research to a
promising source of new drugs. Substances made this way have been
whimsically dubbed "unnatural natural products," but nobody is
laughing about their potential value. "Can you use genetic
engineering to generate novel, structurally complex molecules?
The answer is an unequivocal yes," says Chaitan
S. Khosla of Stanford University, one of the lions in the
field. Moreover, Khosla states, some of these custom-made
molecules have demonstrated biological effects. He has founded a
company, Khosan in San Francisco, to exploit the technique. <P>
The goal of engineered biosynthesis is to imitate and modify the
chemical construction processes naturally performed by bacteria
and fungi. These microorganisms (which have been rich sources of
drugs) make antibiotic compounds and some other large molecules
through a multistep process. Some of these compounds, such as the
antibacterial agent <A HREF="http://www.mc.vanderbilt.edu/vumcdept/derm/contact/OX000.html">oxytetracycline</A> and
the anticancer agent <A HREF="http://www.aidsnyc.org/network/access/drugs/doxo.html">doxorubicin</A>,
are fabricated in the microbes by many different enzymes that
each do one job in turn. <P>
But some of the most chemically elaborate pharmaceuticals,
including a commercially important class of drugs known as 
<A HREF="http://avery.med.virginia.edu/%7Esmb4v/pedpharm/v2n2.html">macrolide
antibiotics</A>, are built inside bacteria by a large enzyme
complex that works like an assembly line. <P>
Much of the recent attention has focused on this assembly-line
process, specifically the one used by the bacterium
<I>Saccharopolyspora erythraea</I> to produce 
<A HREF="http://www.medicinenet.com/MAINMENU/pharmacy/ARTICLE/erythro.htm">erythromycin</A>,
a widely prescribed antibiotic. Trying to figure out how the
process works, <A HREF="http://www.bio.cam.ac.uk/dept/biochem/UTOs/Leadlay.html">Peter
F. Leadlay</A> of the <A HREF="http://www.bio.cam.ac.uk/dept/biochem/">University of Cambridge</A> and 
<A HREF="http://biosci.cbs.umn.edu/asirc/bios/bioslist/lkatz.html">Leonard
Katz</A> of Abbott Laboratories first identified the genes
encoding the enzyme complex that makes the drug.  <P>
The researchers found that the complex--a type 1 polyketide
synthase--consists of three pairs of proteins that together
include at least 28 sites where synthetic reactions occur. Each
of these reactions adds a piece to the growing erythromycin
molecule or forges some chemical bond and then passes the
molecule on to the next site. The complex gradually assembles a
"backbone" of carbon atoms, eventually joining the two ends to
make a large ring: the finished erythromycin molecule. <P>
Leadlay and Khosla are racing each other to understand the
details of the chemical assembly line. By analyzing the genes
encoding the complex, groups led by the two researchers have
shown that many of the active sites in <I>S. erythraea</I>
consist of structurally similar units, or modules. That
observation raised the encouraging prospect that genetic
engineering could shuffle the modules to create variant complexes
that might make new, medically useful compounds. <P>
Until this idea was tried, nobody was sure whether altered
complexes would make anything at all; perhaps the redesigned
complexes would simply grind to a halt. But by splicing genes,
both the Cambridge group and Khosla's group (along with the
latter's collaborators) have succeeded in producing working
versions of the erythromycin complex in bacteria that normally
lack it. These reengineered complexes produce structurally
modified variants of the antibiotic. For instance, the scientists
conducted some genetic tinkering that eliminated parts of the
complex; the resulting complexes were reduced in size and
synthesized ringlike molecules smaller than erythromycin's. <P>
The chemical structures of those rings were just as predicted,
confirming earlier indications that the complex is flexible
enough to withstand some changes without "jamming" the chemical
assembly line. In at least one case, then, a bacterial complex
can be reshuffled to create "unnatural" drugs, ones that the
bacterium would never synthesize on its own. Other experiments
have shown that the products that emerge from the complex can
also be altered by supplying different starting materials. <P>
Recently workers in the field have broken even further with
nature, getting the erythromycin complex and other drug-producing
complexes to function in a test tube--that is, without using
bacteria at all. That emancipation makes it easier to do
experiments. Modular structures like the one seen in the
erythromycin complex seem to occur in many different microbes:
the same basic chain-extending units occur in the complex that
synthesizes <A HREF="http://www.vet.purdue.edu/depts/bms/courses/chmrx/tetrahd.htm">tetracycline</A>
in <A HREF="http://biosci.cbs.umn.edu/asirc/lib/pict/Slivspore1.html">Streptomyces
bacteria</A>, for example. <P>
Pharmaceutical companies are salivating at the prospect that
engineered bacteria could yield chimeric antibiotics--hybrid
drugs that combine the best features of different parent
molecules. Because microbes will not have had a chance to evolve
resistance to chimeric molecules, such drugs might be more
effective than antibiotics now in widespread use. James Staunton,
one of Leadlay's colleagues at Cambridge, says his institution
has already applied for patents relating to chimeric antibiotics.
<A HREF="http://www.Pfizer.com/">Pfizer</A>, 
<A HREF="http://www.glaxowellcome.co.uk/netscape/index.html">Glaxo-Wellcome</A> and Abbott
Laboratories are also exploring the technology or are
preparing to. <P>
It may take years for the dust to settle and for researchers to
learn whether unnatural natural compounds will indeed represent
an important source of new drugs. Khosla is upbeat, estimating
that the technologies needed to construct large arrays of complex
molecules in genetically altered systems are already 80 percent
developed. He says his group has already created 100 novel
molecules using the biosynthesis approach. <P>
Leadlay offers a more cautious assessment. He points out that
some experiments have yielded unexpected products, indicating
that the rules that govern enzyme complexes may not always be as
simple as they at first appear. But even if unnatural natural
products do not themselves turn out to be suitable as drugs,
Leadlay notes, they might be incorporated into schemes to create
variations on a theme by combinatorial chemistry. Either way, the
number of possible untapped compounds is huge and sure to include
some treasures. "It's a large haystack," Leadlay muses, "but I am
confident some things will be possible." <P>

It is the curse of paleontologists that they can never attain a
definitive understanding of the creatures that so captivate
them. A zoologist interested in, say, the predatory behavior of
the tiger can go into the field, watch the action unfold and
take notes. But answers to even the most basic questions about
dinosaurs lie hidden in the silent bones. Undaunted,
paleontologists continue to seek out new fossils and reinterpret
old evidence to learn what dinosaurs were really like--often
with unexpected results.<P>
Some of the most recent work has yielded provocative insights
into how dinosaurs reared their young and what dinosaur calls
sounded like. Perhaps most startling of all, a Saharan
expedition has turned up the remains of a predatory dinosaur
that challenges <A HREF="http://ucmp1.berkeley.edu/trex/specialtrex2.html">Tyrannosaurus rex</A> as the biggest carnivore ever to tread
the earth.<P>
Fragmentary remains of the giant lizard first turned up in
northern Africa in 1927. The creature was given the ungainly
name Carcharodontosaurus saharicus ("shark-toothed reptile from
the Sahara"), but little information could be gleaned from the
scattered fossils. Last fall, however, a <A HREF="http://Geosci.uchicago.edu/">University of Chicago</A> team
led by Paul C. Sereno made an <A HREF=
"http://www.lib.uchicago.edu/~akander/dinoblrb.htm">expedition</A> to the Kem Kem region of Morocco and suddenly
realized the true enormousness, and enormity, of
Carcharodontosaurus. As reported in the <A HREF="http://science-mag.aaas.org/science/scripts/display/short/272/5264/986.html">May 17 issue of Science</A>, the creature's fossilized skull
is 1.6 meters long, even larger than that of T. rex. (Sereno
infers that T. rex probably was the taller of the two, but
Carcharodontosaurus took the prize for sheer bulk.)<P>
Even aside from its sheer size, Carcharodontosaurus is
remarkable in other ways. An examination of its brain case shows
a cranial volume of just 205 cubic centimeters, roughly one
eighth that of a human and just half that of T. rex. It seems
that Carcharodontosaurus was a fighter, not a thinker. Sereno
and his collaborators note that Carcharodontosaurus is also of
interest for the information it provides about dinosaur
evolution. A closely related dinosaur called Gigantosaurus,
which also rivaled T. rex in size, lived in Argentina at about
the same time. Sereno concludes that there was a rapid
evolutionary "radiation" of giant, carnivorous dinosaurs during
the late Cretaceous (90 million to 65 million years ago). Those
new species were spreading around the globe even as plate
tectonics was starting to carry the continents apart.<P>
While some researchers focus on the greatest dinosaur predators,
others are intrigued by a more placid but essential aspect of
dinosaur studies: How did they rear their young? For years,
dinosaurs were popularly portrayed as stupid, <A HREF="http://ucmp1.berkeley.edu/diapsids/locomotion.html">sluggish </A>animals. More recently, scientists have begun to recognize
that dinosaurs may have been more active and behaviorally
complex that previously thought; some researchers now argue
that, based on their <A HREF="http://ucmp1.berkeley.edu/diapsids/avians.html">kinship with
birds</A>, dinosaurs may actually have been attentive parents,
protecting their eggs and guarding their young.<P>
Last December a group led by Mark A. Norell of the <A HREF="http://www.amnh.org/">American Museum of Natural History</A> in
New York scored a major coup for the supporters of the devoted
dinosaur theory. While fossil hunting at the Ukhaa Tolgod site
in central Mongolia Norell's team happened across an
unprecedented find: the skeleton of an <A HREF="http://www.dinosauria.com/jdp/ovie/ovirapt.htm">Oviraptor </A>
(a relative of the <A HREF="http://www.math.iupui.edu/vveloc.html">Velociraptors that
starred in Jurassic Park</A>) <A HREF="http://www.nature.com/nature2/Images/Corner/Past/past007.jpg">buried
atop a nest</A> of dinosaur eggs. In a paper in the December
21/28,1995 issue of <A HREF= "http://www.nature.com">Nature</A>,
Norell claimed not only that the Oviraptor was tending to its
nest but that it did so "in the same posture taken by many
living birds when brooding."<P>
This kinder, gentler vision of dinosaur behavior did not go long
unchallenged. In the <A HREF="http://science-mag.aaas.org/science/scripts/display/short/272/5262/712.html"> May 3, 1996 issue of Science</A>, Nicholas R. Geist and Terry
D. Jones of Oregon State University struck a counterblow. The
two paleontologists examined the pelvic structures of
newly-hatched modern birds and crocodilians, and compared those
with the pelvises of fossilized dinosaur newborns. Geist and
Jones deduced that, among living species, the degree of
ossification (in essence, the strength) of the bone indicates
whether a hatchling is active and independent or weak and
vulnerable. Equivalent fossil studies, the two men reasoned,
could reveal whether dinosaur hatchlings truly needed the kind
of nurturing inferred by Norell's group.<P>
Geist and Jones answer with an emphatic "no." Pelvic and leg
bones in baby dinosaurs look robust, they say, leading the
researchers to assert that "the nesting behavior of dinosaurs
was likely similar to that of modern crocodilians." Norell, not
surprisingly, remains unconvinced, arguing that the discovery of
an Oviraptor in a nesting position is more persuasive than
inferences from studies of bone strength.<P>
The truth may lie somewhere in between. Some birds (shore birds,
for instance) are born in a very capable state, and some modern
reptiles (such as pythons) are known to brood their nests. In
reality, dinosaurs probably shared some parenting traits with
both birds and modern reptiles, and probably had other behaviors
unlike either. And given the bewildering diversity of dinosaur
species, it is improbable that they all reared their young the
same.<P>
The controversy over nesting behavior shows just how hard
paleontologists have to work to extract information not directly
recorded in the fossil record. For instance, they have long
puzzled over a peculiar class of dinosaurs, known as crested <A HREF="http://ucmp1.berkeley.edu/diapsids/ornithischia/hadrosauria.html">duck-bills</A> (more technically, as 
<A HREF="http://ucmp1.berkeley.edu/diapsids/ornithischia/parasaurolophus.gif"> lambeosaurine dinosaurs</A>), that sported huge bony
protrusions from the top of their heads. What function did these
crests serve? Scientists can only speculate, but another new
fossil discovery may be bringing them closer to an answer.<P>
Last fall a team led by <A HREF="http://www.aps.edu/htmlpages/TomW.html">Thomas E. Williamson</A> of the 
<A HREF= "http://www.aps.edu/HTMLpages/nmmnh.html">New Mexico Museum of Natural History</A> found an
exceptionally well-preserved skull of <A HREF="http://www.aps.edu/HTMLPages/parasaur.html">Parasaurolophus</A>, a lambeosaurine dinosaur whose crest
extended in a long backward arc. Williamson was eager to learn
more about the internal structure of the crest but did not want
to fracture the fossil. So he turned to the world of
high-technology: St. Joseph's Hospital in Albuquerque, New
Mexico donated the use of a medical computed tomography (CT)
scanner, which can create three-dimensional x-ray images.<P>
The CT scans revealed that the Parasaurolophus crest has a
previously unseen, very complicated internal structure
containing multiple chambers. The exact purpose of those
chambers is still unknown, but the overall structure is
consistent with the theory that the crest functioned as an
acoustic resonator--a kind of biological trumpet that may have
aided in mating calls or other kinds of audible communication.<P>
To put this theory to the test, David Weishampel of Johns
Hopkins University built a model Parasaurolophus crest out of
plastic tubing and tried playing it like a wind instrument; it
seemed to work well, producing resonant, musical tones.
Expanding on that idea, Diane Farish, an undergraduate at the
University of New Mexico, constructed a model of the recently
unearthed Parasaurolophus crest. She found that it amplifies the
low frequency sounds that, Williamson speculates, may have been
effective for long-distance communication through thick jungle
growth.<P>
Williamson is now collaborating with <A HREF="http://www.cs.sandia.gov/%7ediegert/my_home_page/home.html">Carl Diegert</A> of Sandia National Laboratories to construct a
detailed <A HREF="http://www.sandia.gov/LabNews/LN03-15-96/dino.html#top">computer
model</A> of the Parasaurolophus skull. The model can then be
modified to add in the soft tissues that do not normally survive
the fossilization process. Once he is satisfied that he has
achieved a plausible reconstruction of the crest from a living
Parasaurolophus, Williamson plans to use the computer model to
simulate the sounds that the dinosaur could have created.<P>
Nobody will ever know exactly what sort of noises--if
any--Parasaurolophus made. But thanks to the ingenuity of a
bunch of hairless, bipedal mammals, dinosaur calls may be heard
again, for the first time in 65 million years.<P>

On June 12 the Internet erupted with digital fireworks
celebrating free speech: a three-judge federal panel in
Philadelphia had just issued a preliminary injunction barring
the U.S. government from enforcing the <A HREF="http://www.eff.org/pub/Alerts/s652_hr1555_96_draft_bill.excerpt">Communications Decency Act</A> (CDA), leaving the on-line world safe once again for George
Carlin's "<A HREF="http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/users/kashmir/dirty.html">Seven Dirty Words</A>"
monologue and pictures of the <A HREF="http://www.paris.org.:80/Musees/Louvre/Treasures/gifs/venusdemilo.gif">Venus De Milo</A>.
The Act, passed by the U.S. Congress as part of an omnibus
<A HREF="http://wwwpub.utdallas.edu/~rfisher/ba3351/telecom.txt">telecommunications reform bill</A>
and signed by President Clinton on February 8, would impose a
$100,000 fine and two-year jail term on anyone who allows minors
to gain access to "indecent" words or pictures by electronic
means. Its constitutionality, questioned from the beginning,
will now be decided by the U.S. Supreme Court.<P>
During the judicial hearings that culminated in the injunction,
government witnesses conceded that digital pictures of unclad
sculptures or nude paintings that are on public display in
museums (such as Modigliani's "<A HREF="http://sunsite.unc.edu/wm/paint/auth/modigliani/nude-sdraiato.jpg">Nude Sdraiato</A>"
or Ingre's "<A HREF="http://sunsite.unc.edu/wm/paint/auth/ingres/turkish-bath.jpg">The Turkish Bath</A>")
could fall under the letter of the law. The witnesses had argued
that the Act was nonetheless constitutional because it was
unlikely that a federal prosecutor would actually move to
imprison someone who transmitted such images.<P>
The three Federal District judges--Dolores Sloviter, Ronald
Buckwalter and Stewart Dalzell--were apparently unconvinced by
this and other arguments advanced by the Act's supporters. "It
is no exaggeration to conclude that the Internet has achieved,
and continues to achieve, the most participatory marketplace of
mass speech that this country -- and indeed the world -- has yet
seen. . . . Modern-day Luthers still post their theses, but to
electronic bulletin boards rather than the door of the
Wittenberg Schlosskirche," wrote Dalzell in his portion of the
<A HREF="http://www-leland.stanford.edu/%7Ehanson/CDA/CDA_960612.html">decision</A>. He predicted that no significant regulation of Internet
speech would withstand constitutional scrutiny.<P>
Even should the Supreme Court strike down the Act, free speech
on the global infobahn is far from assured. In the U.S., more
than a dozen states have enacted rules barring the transmission
of unwanted material, ranging from the "indecency" cited (but
not defined) by Congress to "any depiction of breasts or
buttocks not completely and opaquely covered." Each of these
laws will have to be challenged individually, says Ann Beeson of
the <A HREF="http://www.aclu.org/">American Civil Liberties Union</A>.
Furthermore, until state prosecutors begin to enforce the laws,
their validity cannot be tested.<P>
Perhaps more important, however, is the growing recognition that
the First Amendment is "only a local ordinance," in the words of
<A HREF="http://www2.eff.org/%7Ebarlow/barlow.html">John Perry Barlow</A>,
lyricist for the Grateful Dead and co-founder of the <A HREF="http://www.eff.org/">Electronic
Frontier Foundation</A>. The People's
Republic of China has announced plans for a "Great Firewall"
through which only politically innocuous data may pass, and
Germany has attempted to cut off access to Nazi images or texts
from within the nation's borders. Government prosecutors
instructed <A HREF="http://ttt.www.media.mit.edu/Pub-sponsers/deutsche.html">Deutsche Telecom</A>,
which handles German Internet traffic, to block access to the
addresses of Web servers known to hold illicit material. And
early in June, the South Korean government put out orders to
block a Canadian Internet site that hosts a collection of North
Korean political pamphlets.<P>
Last month, ostensibly acting on a complaint from a subscriber,
French police arrested the managers of two Internet access
companies (<A HREF="http://www.worldnet.fr/">WorldNet</A> and
<A HREF="http://www.francenet.fr/franceweb/">FranceNet</A>) because
pornographic images of children were among the roughly 100,000
messages a day that passed through the companies' computers; the
source of the images was not known. The managers estimated that
they would have to employ about 300 censors if the government
required them to sift through all the material they received and
passed on to users.<P>
As the Internet grows, the range of community standards that it
must accommodate will likewise continue to widen. Issues of
offensiveness, decency and palatable speech will pose an ever
greater threat to the free movement of information through the
network.<P>
One promising alternative to Internet-wide censorship is to let
users set their own standards.
<A HREF="http://www.surfwatch.com/">SurfWatch</A> and several other
companies have developed rating systems and software that can
prevent Internet browsers from getting to objectionable
materials. Scanning algorithms may also block innocent
information, however; among those who have found themselves at
least temporarily data non grata are a Nynex web site that used
"XXX" in its file names, a breast-cancer support group on
America Online, and the town of
<A HREF="http://www.computerprint.co.uk/scunthorpe">Scunthorpe</A>, England.<P>
A consortium of computer companies, publishers and other
organizations has developed a new architecture for blocking
software, called <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/PICS/">PICS</A>
(Platform for Internet Content Selection). It would enable
people to choose whatever rating system they want. (The ratings
might be based on evaluations supplied by the authors of
individual web pages, by independent evaluators, or even
selectively by parents or teachers.) Users can develop their own
versions of the "Index Expurgatorius": Web access could be
limited to information suitable for children, for instance, to
pages containing information about molecular biology, or to all
sites suitable for those of a libertarian mindset.<P>
The beauty of PICS, according to the consortium's statement of
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/PICS/iacwc.htm">purpose</A>, is that
"the Internet can regulate itself through local choices about
what to receive." Nevertheless, a question lingers: will we make
those choices ourselves, or will someone else make them for us?<P>

In 1935 the Austrian physicist Erwin Schroedinger proposed a
<A HREF=http://www.ifi.uio.no/~thomah/schroedingerscat.html>thought experiment</A> that has titillated philosophers and <A HREF=http://pantheon.cis.yale.edu/~zetie/story/schcat>appalled
cat lovers</A> ever since. Now four researchers at the
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in Boulder,
Colo., have carried out the notorious <A HREF=http://www.mtnmath.com/faq/meas-qm-3.html>"Schroedinger's cat"</A> test using not a living feline
but a positively charged atom- -yes, a "cation" in scientific
parlance--of beryllium.<P>
Although somewhat smaller than a cat,
the cation is still much larger than the electrons, photons and
other particles that commonly exhibit bizarre quantum behavior. In
a report in the May 24 issue of <A HREF=http://science-mag.aaas.org/science/scripts/display/short/272/5265/1131.html>Science</A>,
the NIST team expresses the hope that their "mesoscopic system may
provide insight into the fuzzy boundary between the <A HREF=http://www.chem.cornell.edu/~gse1/multidqc.html>classical
and quantum worlds." </A><P>
Schroedinger devised the cat
experiment to illustrate just how radically the quantum realm
differs from the macroscopic, everyday world that we inhabit. He
himself had shown that a particle such as an electron exists in a
number of possible states, the probability of each of which is
incorporated into an equation known as the wave function. In the
case of an atom of radioactive material, for example, the atom has
a certain probability of decaying over a given period of time.
<P>Based onour "classical" intuition, we would assume that there
are only two possibilities: either the atom has decayed, or it has
not. According to quantum physics, however, the atom inhabits
both states simultaneously. It is only when an observer
actually tries to determine the state of the atom by measuring it
that the wave function "collapses," and the atom assumes just one
of its possible states: decayed or undecayed.<P> 
Schroedinger
reasoned that such probabilistic behavior could exist in the
macroscopic world as well, even if we are rarely aware of it. He
imagined a box containing an atom having a 50 percent likelihood
of decaying in an hour, a radiation detector, a flask containing
poison gas and a cat. When or if the atom decays, the Geiger
counter will trigger a switch that causes a hammer to smash the
flask, releasing the gas and killing the cat. When the
experimenter opens the lid of the box and peers inside after an
hour has passed, he or she will find the atom either intact or
decayed and the cat either alive or dead. But according to quantum
mechanics, during the period before the lid is opened, the cat
exists in two superposed states: both dead and alive.<P>During the
1980s, the late theorist John Bell suggested a more palatable
version of Schroedinger's experiment, one in which the decay of
the atom causes a bottle of milk to spill onto the floor; the
superposed cat is thus hungry or full rather than alive or dead.
But either version seems weirdly nonsensical: the outcome seems
logical from a quantum physics viewpoint, but common sense tells
us that a cat cannot be alive and dead (or hungry and full) at the
same time.<P>The paradox of Schroedinger's cat has provoked a
great deal of debate among theoretical physicists and
philosophers. Although some thinkers have argued that the cat
actually does exist in two superposed states, most contend that
superposition only occurs when a quantum system is isolated from
the rest of its environment. Various explanations have been
advanced to account for this paradox--including the idea that the
cat, or simply the animal's physical environment, can act as an
observer.<P>The question is, at what point, or scale, do the
probabilistic rules of the quantum realm give way to the
deterministic laws that govern the macroscopic world? This
question has been brought into vivid relief by the recent work
done by the NIST team, which includes <A HREF=http://physics.colorado.edu/faculty/monroe.c.html>Christopher
Monroe</A>, Dawn Meekhof, Brian King and Dave Wineland. The group
confined a charged beryllium atom in a tiny electromagnetic cage
and then cooled it with a laser to its lowest energy state. In
this state the position of the atom and its "spin" (a quantum
property that is only metaphorically analogous to spin in the
ordinary sense) could be ascertained to within a very high degree
of accuracy, limited by <A HREF=http://zebu.uoregon.edu/%7Eimamura/122/feb9/hup.html>Heisenberg's
uncertainty principle.</A><P>
The workers then stimulated the atom
with a laser just enough to change its wave function; according to
the new wave function of the atom, it now had a 50 percent
probability of being in a "spin-up" state in its initial position
and an equal probability of being in a "spin-down" state in a
position as much as 80 nanometers away, a vast distance indeed for
the atomic realm. In effect, the atom was in two different places,
as well as two different spin states, at the same time--an atomic
analog of a cat both living and dead.<P>
(The clinching evidence
that the NIST researchers had achieved their goal came from their
observation of an interference pattern; that phenomenon is a
telltale sign that a single beryllium atom produced two distinct
wave functions that interfered with each other.)<P>
The NIST
investigators are planning experiments that will probe more deeply
into the process by which superposed systems "decohere," losing
their schizoid qualities and giving way to more mundane classical
behavior. Monroe says he and his colleagues hope both to coax
single ions into a superposition of three or more states and to
manipulate two or more ions in the same trap.<P>
If the past is any
guide, these experiments will not resolve the mystery of quantum
mechanics but will only underscore just how deeply it seems to
contradict our usual expectations. As <A HREF=http://orac.sunderland.ac.uk/~hs0bcl/h_nb.htm>Niels Bohr</A> was
fond of saying of quantum mechanics, "If you think you understand
it, that only shows you don't know the first thing about
it."<P>--John Horgan, staff writer<HR>

<P>An <A

immune system</A>  can sort through a <A
HREF="http://www-chem.ucsd.edu/Faculty/goodman/antibody.html/abpage.html">trillion
antibodies</A> to find just one that will bind to an invading
pathogen--and do it before an infection gets out of hand. Since the
late 1980s, a number of chemists have used the immune system as a
model in devising technology to speed up the painstakingly slow
process for assessing new drugs. This method, known as combinatorial
chemistry, has evolved into a valuable alternative to the usual
practice of synthesizing potentially life-saving compounds one by one.
Now it is poised for much wider applications, aiding technologists in
their relentless hunt for materials having better electrical,
magnetic, optical or catalytic properties.
<P>Combinatorial chemistry
allows a large number of drug candidates--nucleic acids, peptides and
small organic molecules--to be screened simultaneously. <A
HREF="http://www.biospace.com/g/synd/__0054b806/exhib_script/exhibitors/AffymaxResearchInstitute.html">Affymax
Research Institute</A>, a biotechnology company located in Palo Alto,
Calif., has been a leader in the development of the combinatorial
technique. Last year, Affymax was purchased by <A
HREF="http://www.glaxowellcome.co.uk/">Glaxo</A>, the world's largest
drug maker. A few of the founders of Affymax recently embarked on an
effort to apply combinatorial methods to the rest of the material
world. Instead of working with biological molecules, these researchers
are demonstrating how to use the combinatorial technique to screen
thousands of both organic and inorganic compounds at a time. 
<P>Two
articles that appeared last year in the journal <I>Science</I>
outlined the potential of that approach for both speeding and
broadening the cumbersome process of looking for novel materials. And
a new company <A HREF="http://www.symyx.com">Symyx</A>, (derived from
the Greek word that means "to commingle substances to form something
new"), has licensed the technology to develop it into a marketable
product.
<P>One of the <A
HREF="http://www.symyx.com/science.html">papers</A> described the use
of combinatorial techniques to synthesize an array of high-temperature
superconducting materials, quickly and easily. A team of researchers
from the University of California at Berkeley and the <A
HREF="http://ux9.lbl.gov/">Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley
National Laboratory</A> (LBNL) deployed an ion gun that sputters, or
sprays, oxides through stencil-like masks onto a metal surface. "It's
like a sophisticated spray paint can," explains <A
HREF="http://www.cchem.berkeley.edu/%7Echemgrad/RESEARCH/schultz.html">Peter
Schultz</A>, a chemistry professor at the <A
HREF="http://www.hhmi.org/">Howard Hughes Medical Institute</A> at the
University of California at Berkeley, who co-led the research effort
with Xiao-Dong Xiang of LBNL. The technique is also similar to that
used in the semiconductor industry to create circuit patterns on a
chip by exposing selected sections to ultraviolet light. 
<P>In
Schultz's experiment, the ion gun sprayed seven metal oxides--one at a
time--through a mask having 128 rectangular openings, each of which
measures just one by two millimeters. The entire grid covered a
surface no larger than a single square on a checkerboard. To vary the
composition within each of the 128 thin-film rectangles, a set of
additional masks were placed atop the one that defined the grid
elements. Each overlay mask blocked an oxide from reaching certain
rows or columns of the grid. Researchers changed the overlay mask as
each of the seven oxides was laid down separately. The various mask
geometries insured that each rectangle in the array received a
different combination of the seven oxides. The resulting mixtures were
then sintered (baked) to produce finished ceramics. 
<P>The researchers
then used an electrical probe to measure the resistance of the
compounds at different temperatures. A number of the small rectangular
thin-film elements were designed to replicate the properties of two
known high-temperature superconductors--and, as hoped, the materials
in those rectangles conducted electricity without resistance at 80 to
90 kelvins (degrees Celsius above absolute zero). That temperature is
high enough that the coolant can be liquid nitrogen--a preferable
alternative to the far more costly and short-lived liquid helium that
is needed to supercool classical superconductors down to four kelvins.
 
<P>Schultz and Xiang believe that these techniques will dramatically
reduce the time consumed in testing new materials, because thousands
of assays can be performed in a matter of hours. Current materials
characterization methods typically require an entire work day just to
test a single compound. 
<P>Moreover, combinatorial methods may apply
across a broad range of materials. In a subsequent paper in <I><A
HREF="http://science-mag.aaas.org/science/scripts/display/short/270/5234/273.html">Science</A></I>,
the experimenters successfully utilized the same methods to
characterize the properties of a class of crystalline ceramics known
as <A
HREF="http://micro.magnet.fsu.edu/micro/gallery/perovskite/perovskite.html">perovskites</A>--specifically,
cobalt oxide perovskites. These perovskites display what is called <A
HREF="http://ux9.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Archive/magnetoresistive.html">colossal
magnetoresistance</A>: their electrical resistance changes
dramatically when exposed to a magnetic field, which makes them ideal
for high-capacity data storage. 
<P>Combinatorial technology is now
headed to market. Symyx, which was started by Schultz and Affymax's
founder and chief executive, <A
HREF="http://www.symyx.com/founder.html">Alejandro Zaffaroni</A>, is
focusing on development of more practical hardware for  creating and
testing new materials. The company is considering, for instance, how
to facilitate development of improved versions of the phosphors that
light up computer or television displays. Combinatorial techniques
could create a kind of display screen in which each picture element,
or pixel, is illuminated by a phosphor having a different composition
than the surrounding ones. The phosphors could be deposited through
masks directly onto a base of conductive materials, which in turn
would serve as an interface to the electrodes that send a current to
the pixels. When the display is turned on, the phosphors that glow
brightest or that show the most vivid colors could readily be singled
out for further examination in the laboratory. 
<P>A similar approach
might assist in the never-ending quest for better batteries. In this
case, one would start with an array of miniature electrodes built on
an insulating surface. Again employing a series of masks, workers
could then fabricate thin layers of polymers that would serve as solid
electrolytes between the grid of tiny anodes and cathodes. The
polymers having the most desirable electrical properties would stand
out.
<P>Combinatorial materials science seems poised to change the way
chemists work. "Instead of designing one experiment, you can design
10,000," Schultz says. Trial-and-error may become a lot more trial and
a lot less error.

Alien worlds are a staple of science fiction but until just a
few months ago, they had no place in science fact. Despite
decades of earnest searches, astronomers had no direct evidence
that planets circle other stars. Then last October, Michel Mayor
and Didier Queloz of Geneva Observatory detected a planet
circling the <A
HREF="http://wea.mankato.mn.us/tps/pegasus.html">  star 51
Pegasi</A>--and the floodgates opened. In rapid succession,
observers have reported finding at least four more planets
circling nearby stars; two of these sightings are so new that
they have not yet been formally announced in the literature.
"This is a unique era," exclaims Alan P. Boss of the Carnegie
Institution of Washington, an expert in modeling planetary
formation. "It is the most exciting thing I've seen in my
scientific career."<P>
<B>The Hunt is On</B><P>
For now, the planet-hunting trophy goes to the team led by<A
HREF="http://www.physics.sfsu.edu/faculty/gmarcy.html"> Geoffrey
W. Marcy</A> and R. <A
HREF="http://astro.berkeley.edu/%7Epaul/">Paul Butler</A> of San
Francisco State University and the University of California at
Berkeley. They helped confirm the results announced by Mayor and
Queloz, and then swiftly turned up three planets of their own.
More discoveries are surely on the way: Marcy reports that "we
see hints of planets in a lot of our data." His group has set up
a dedicated <A
HREF="http://cannon.sfsu.edu/%7Ewilliams/planetsearch/planetsearch.html"> planet-search
Web site</A> to keep up with the rapid progress of the work. A
fifth planetary detection will be reported by George Gatewood of
the University of Pittsburgh at the upcoming meeting of the <A
HREF="http://www.aas.org/meetings/aas188/prelim/prelim.html">American
Astronomical Society</A>.<P>
Nobody has actually seen the new planets; they were all
identified indirectly, by measuring the way they influenced the
motion of their parent stars. As an object orbits a star, its
gravitational pull causes the star to wobble back and forth.
That motion creates a periodic displacement, or <A
HREF="http://physics7.berkeley.edu/darkmat/dopplershift.html">Doppler
shift</A>,in the spectrum of the star as seen from the earth.
Marcy and Butler, like Mayor and Queloz and several other teams,
examine spectra for the tiny displacements that could denote the
presence of planets. <A
HREF="http://cannon.sfsu.edu/%7Ewilliams/planetsearch/tech/techpg.html">The
Doppler technique</A> can reveal the orbit and the minimum mass
of an orbiting body, but no details of its nature.<P>
Gatewood takes a somewhat different approach, one that relies on
direct observation of stellar motion. Stars are not fixed in
place; they appear to drift across the sky, though very slowly.
The same back-and-forth movement that produces Doppler shifts
also causes a star's path to appear as a zig-zag rather than a
straight line. Gatewood and his colleagues are looking--very
carefully--for those telltale wiggles. That precision
measurement of stellar positions is known as astrometry.<P>
The success of these techniques has sent ripples of excitement
through the astronomical community and captured the public
imagination. Despite some overzealous <A
HREF="http://www.sjmercury.com/news/space117.htm"> early
statements</A>, the newfound bodies are very unlikely to harbor
life (much less <A HREF="http://www.seti-inst.edu/faq.html">
intelligent life</A>). But they do suggest that planets are
common throughout the cosmos, raising the hope that living
things flourish somewhere among the multitude of worlds. The
planets are also quite unlike anything in our solar system,
forcing theorists to reconsider their notions of how stars and
planets form.<P>
<B>Strange New Worlds</B><P>
The planet around <A
HREF="http://zebu.uoregon.edu/51peg.html">51 Pegasi</A> is
perhaps the oddest of the bunch. Its mass is at least half that
of Jupiter, and yet it orbits just seven million kilometers from
its star--less than one eighth Mercury's distance from the sun.
At such proximity, the planet's surface should be baked to a
theoretical temperature of 1,300 degree Celsius. It whizzes
around its star so quickly that its "year" is just four days
long.<P>
Marcy and Butler recently posted a notice on their Web site of
the discovery of a somewhat similar planet circling the star
HR3522, also known as 55 Rho Cancri. (Marcy describes the
announcement as an experiment in "publishing by Internet": a way
to air a new finding before passing it through peer review.)
This object has at least four fifths the mass of Jupiter and
orbits at a distance of about 25 million kilometers.<P>
One of the bodies identified by Marcy and Butler is a very
massive object--at least 6.5 times the mass of Jupiter. It
orbits around the star 70 Virginis in a highly eccentric, or
oval, path quite unlike those of the familiar planets. Although
some news reporters optimistically dubbed the planet
"Goldilocks," claiming it has just the right temperature for
liquid water, this heavyweight is most likely a gaseous world
lacking a solid surface on which water could collect.<P>
The final planet discovered by Marcy and Butler (so far) has
less extreme attributes. Its three-year orbit takes it on a
circular course about 300 million kilometers from its star
(corresponding to an orbit between Mars and Jupiter) and its
mass is at minimum 2.3 times that of Jupiter. It would not seem
terribly out of place in our own solar system.<P>
It comes as no surprise that astronomers are mostly finding
giant, short-period planets, for a simple reason: these are the
easiest to pick out using the Doppler technique. Detecting a
solar system like our own (in which the most massive planet,
Jupiter, takes a full 12 years to complete one orbit) would
require at least another decade or two of high-precision Doppler
observations.<P>
In contrast, the astrometric approach that Gatewood uses is most
sensitive to planets in large, leisurely orbits. After
scrutinizing 50 years of observations of the star Lalande 21185,
he has tentatively deduced the presence of a Jupiter-mass planet
in a 5.8-year orbit; the planet would circle at more than twice
the earth's distance from the sun. Gatewood also sees evidence
of a second planet in a 30-year orbit. (He has released an
early <A
HREF="http://gag.observ-gr.fr:80/%7Elistserv/exoplanetes/0030.html"> abstract
describing these results</A>.)<P>
David C. Black of the <A
HREF="http://www.usra.edu/usra/Sites/lpi.html"> Lunar and
Planetary Institute</A> in Houston, Texas considers Gatewood's
sighting to be the only one that would satisfy his definition of
what a planet is. "It is not clear that any of the others have
anything to do with planets," he says, arguing that they
probably formed in a fundamentally different way than the
planets that orbit the sun.<P>
<B>Where Do Planets Come From?</B><P>
Indeed, the question of how these planets (or non-planets)
formed is a vexing one that has already generated considerable
discussion. Current theory holds that giant planets can form
only at comparatively great distances from a star, where cold
temperatures allow ice and frozen gases to gather together. What
then are Jupiter-mass bodies doing so close to the stellar
hearth? Boss suggests that these planets actually formed at much
greater distances from their stars but then migrated inward.<P>
One variant of this theory is described by Douglas N.C. Lin
ofLick Observatory and his colleagues in a recent issue of <A
HREF="http://www.nature.com/"> Nature</A>.In this view, newborn
planets can interact with the disk of material from which they
form, causing them to spiral toward the central star. Inner
planets (which could have turned out to be more earth-like)
might have been destroyed during this early epoch. Whatever the
explanation, the surprising attributes of the new planets
clearly demonstrate that there are many ways that planetary
systems form.<P>
And what of planets like the earth--are they out there too? They
lie beyond the grasp of most current search techniques. But NASA
administrator <A
HREF="http://www.gsfc.nasa.gov/hqpao/bios/dan_goldin.html">
Daniel S. Goldin</A> has set the detection and study of
earth-like bodies around other stars as one of NASA's <A
HREF="http://www.aas.org/public_policy/goldin.html"> top
priorities</A>. The most likely way to achieve that goal is by
building a sophisticated space-based interferometer (as recently
described by J. Roger P. Angel and Neville J. Woolf in this
magazine). Ground-based tests of optical interferometers are
already underway.<P>
The current list of extrasolar planets represents only the tip
of  the iceberg. Continued observations, careful data analysis
and innovative technologies will soon yield many more
discoveries, giving us a better sense of the true variety of
worlds out there.<P>

Tornadoes are unpredictable and deadly--witness the set of
twisters that tore through Bangladesh on May 13, killing atleast
500 and injuring up to 50,000 people (and look at recent <A
HREF="http://www.awc-kc.noaa.gov/spc/stats/statij.html"
TARGET="_TOP"> tornado statistics</A>.<P>
Tornadoes are also irresistible, it seems. Stout-hearted "<A
HREF="http://taiga.geog.niu.edu/chaser/chaser.html"
TARGET="_TOP">storm chasers</A>" race to put themselves right in
the path of danger, both for the sheer thrill of it and to
gather information that will clarify how tornadoes form, gather
strength and dissipate. The obsession seems to be catching:
thrill-seekers are flocking to see <A
HREF="http://www.boston.com:80/wgbh/pages/imax/screen.html"
TARGET="_TOP"> real</A> and <A
HREF="http://www.movies.warnerbros.com/twister/" TARGET="_TOP">
imagined</A> tornadoes blast across movie screens throughout the
U.S.<P>
The basic atmospheric physics that gives rise to tornadoes is
well understood by now. Thunderstorms usually contain updrafts,
large rising swells of warm, moist air. As the updraft moves, it
rotates; if the rotation grows sufficiently intense, the storm
can evolve into a tornado or funnel cloud (a tornado whose
bottom does not touch the ground). Supercomputer <A
HREF="http://redrock.ncsa.uiuc.edu/AOS/imax.html" TARGET="_TOP">
simulations</A> depict this process quite dramatically.<P>
Most tornadoes form within an especially intense weather system
known as a supercell. Supercell thunderstorms occur when the
warm updraft punches through an overlying, stable layer and
continues upward into a zone of cool, dry air. The resulting
instabilities produce powerful vortex motions, the lifeblood of
tornadoes (a pair of <A
HREF="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Cyberia/MetaComp/Weather.html"
TARGET="_TOP">computer-generated images</A> depicts the
difference between supercell and non-supercell storms). Within
the fiercest tornadoes, wind speeds can approach 300 miles per
hour. Air rushing in to fill the low-pressure void left by the
tornado creates additional fierce, potentially damaging winds.
Staying out of <A
HREF="http://femapub1.fema.gov/fema/fact09a.html"
TARGET="_TOP">danger</A> is no easy task when a tornado is
anywhere near.<P>
One of the most dangerous aspects of tornadoes is their
capriciousness. Sometimes an updraft gives rise to a tornado;
sometimes it does not. Scientists are still hard pressed
topredict exactly when and where a tornado will appear; that
uncertainty makes it difficult to raise the alarm in time tosave
lives.<P>
In order to nail down some of the tricky details of tornado
formation, <A HREF="http://www.nssl.uoknor.edu/%7Eerik/"
TARGET="_TOP">Erik Rasmussen</A> of the <A
HREF="http://www.nssl.uoknor.edu/" TARGET="_TOP">National Severe
Storms Laboratory</A> in Norman, Okla., banded together with
several of his colleagues to undertake storm studies of
unprecedented accuracy. The researchers called their project
Verification of the Origins of Rotation in Tornadoes Experiment,
usually shortened to its handy acronym of <A
HREF="http://antietam.nssl.uoknor.edu/mosaic_files/vortex.html"
TARGET="_TOP">VORTEX</A>.During tornado season (April 1 to June
15) of 1994 and 1995, the VORTEX scientists intercepted and
monitored 10 severe twisters.<P>
Those studies were greatly aided by a tool known as <A
HREF="http://aaron.uoknor.edu/xband/" TARGET="_TOP">Doppler
radar</A>, which can measure local wind speeds at very high
resolution. During the Dimmitt, Tex., tornado of June 2, 1995,
the researchers used a single, portable radar device (the
"Doppler on Wheels") that produced <A
HREF="http://aaron.uoknor.edu/xband/data.1995.html"
TARGET="_TOP">sharp images</A> showing wind features just 200
feet across--good enough to show clearly the tornado, its
evacuated core and the surrounding cloud of debris. This year <A
HREF="http://aaron.uoknor.edu/jwurman/index.html"
TARGET="_TOP">Joshua Wurman</A> of the University of Oklahoma
and his collaborators plan to use a <A
HREF="http://aaron.uoknor.edu/bistatic/index.html"
TARGET="_TOP">pair of Doppler radars</A>, which will enable them
to assemble more complete, three-dimensional maps of wind
patterns.<P>
At present, the VORTEX researchers are still digesting their
massive files of data. <A
HREF="http://www.nssl.uoknor.edu/projects/vortex/sls/watson/watson.html"
TARGET="_TOP"> A preliminary report</A> from the project
participants describes some of the remarkably intricate
observations of the Dimmitt tornado, generally considered the
most thoroughly studied twister in history.<P>
One frustration voiced in that paper is the extreme speed of
these weather outbursts. The time from formation of a tornado to
touch down is no more than a few tens of minutes, "providing
little time for operational observation, identification and
warning," the VORTEX team notes.<P>
<A HREF="http://wwwghcc.msfc.nasa.gov/otd.html"
TARGET="_TOP">The Optical Transient Detector</A>, an
experimental NASA detector recently lofted into Earth orbit,
offers hope that longer advance warnings may be possible. A
group led by Hugh J. Christian of the Marshall Space Flight
Center used the satellite to tally the rate of lightning flashes
in large storms. One<A
HREF="http://www.msfc.nasa.gov/general/news/press_releases/95-46_OTD_Tornados.html"
TARGET="_TOP"> provocative finding</A> was that the flash rate
often peaks shortly before tornadoes appear.<P>
The Optical Transient Detector also detected far more flashes
than were observed from the ground--a sign that the storms that
produce tornadoes create mostly cloud-to-cloud strikes. These
intra-cloud bolts seem to occur primarily while the storm is
building in strength, so space-based observations could help
alert people on the ground to the mounting tornado risk.<P>
Tornadoes are not yet tamed, of course--how could they be? But
clever research and new technologies promise at least to take a
little wind out of their sails.<P>

<CENTER><BR><H1>Smart Materials</H1><P>
They will soon be in everything<BR> from computers to concrete
bridges.<P></CENTER>
Forget dumb old bricks and mortar: engineers are designing
future devices from exotic materials that incorporate chemical
switches or mechanical sensors to improve their performance.
These "smart materials" are just starting to emerge from the
laboratory, but soon you can expect to find them in everything
from laptop computers to concrete bridges.<P>
At a recent conference in San Diego, attendees were allowed a
glimpse of a smart future still under construction. A hodgepodge
group of physicists, chemists, computer scientists, civil
engineers and even washing machine makers gathered to compare
notes and to demonstrate for one another a host of inventions
that stretch, twist, measure or respond in novel ways (the
diversity is readily apparent from a quick glance at the <A
HREF="http://www.spie.org/web/meetings/programs/ss96_home.html"> conference
program</A>).Meanwhile, the conference's keynote speakers--most
notably James S. Sirkis of the University of Maryland--wrangled
over just how to define this <A
HREF="050596explorationsbox2.html">new cross-discipline</A>.<P>
Unifying the field, the doyens concluded, is a shared goal to
enhance ordinary objects or to create extraordinary ones by
embedding sensors, processors or actuators into larger things.
An alternative explanation, however, might be that the
all-embracing label of smart materials provides an excuse for
playful engineers to do cool things with polymers, fiber optics
and microprocessors.<P>
Certainly there was no lack of creativity in San Diego.
Applications for smart materials covered a broad gamut. Jeff M.
Melzak's group at Case Western Reserve University is embedding
silicon pressure sensors into Goodyear tires to improve fuel
economy and reduce wear. Army researchers are placing
piezoelectric crystals inside helicopter rotor blades; the
crystals produce a feedback response intended to reduce the
vibration and noise inside the cockpit.<P>
Philip R. Troyk of the Illinois Institute of Technology has
constructed wireless sensors no larger than a Rice Krispie.
Implanted in a patient's muscle, the devices could relay
information on local nerve activity via radio to an external
computer. The devices could also receive power through magnetic
induction and send out mild shocks that stimulate the muscle
into action.<P>
A few inventions demonstrated at the conference appear to offer
considerable promise. Consider:<UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI><A
HREF="050596explorationsbox3.html">Advanced liquid crystal
displays</A> may soon improve the quality of life of anyone who
uses laptop and hand-held computers. A team at Kent State
University was touting a new kind of liquid crystal technology;
it should lead to flat color display panels that have much
better resolution and lower cost than current state-of-the-art
LCDs. The smart-crystal displays will also consume far less
battery power, allowing portables to come closer to living up to
their name.
<LI><A
HREF="050596explorationsbox4.html">Artificial muscles</A> that
expand and contract in a controllable way could find numerous
applications in robotics, medical implants, even virtual
reality. At the smart materials conference, researchers at the
University of New Mexico showed off an artificial muscle
substance that is twice as strong as human muscles and contracts
nearly as fast.
<LI><A
HREF="050596explorationsbox5.html">Embedded sensors</A> offer a
way to monitor the health of structures that undergo a lot of
wear and tear--concrete bridges and icebreaker propellers, to
name just two examples. Engineers hope to save both money and
lives with smart structures that warn their operators when the
load becomes more than they can bear.</UL>
These projects may
seem to have little in common with one another. But new areas of
technology always emerge through chaos and confusion over their
mission. Smart material researchers can at least take heart in
the rapid changes in their field; it will probably take only
years, rather than decades, before their work starts yielding
useful products.<P>

<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=360>It's a scene that would not play well
on a show like ER: a patient comes in complaining of numbness,
blurred vision and difficulty speaking. Doctors diagnose a
stroke--but instead of racing to perform emergency surgery or a
dramatic table top resuscitation, they simply run a few tests
and prescribe medication. This less flamboyant way of treating
stroke might make for dull television, but it is fast becoming
an action-paced area of medicine. <A
HREF="http://www.stroke.org/facts.html" >Strokes are the third
leading killer</A> in the U.S., after <A
HREF="http://www.reg.uci.edu/UCI/CARDIOLOGY/PREVENTIVE/FACTS/"
>heart disease</A> and<A
HREF="http://www.oncolink.upenn.edu/topics/"> cancer</A>. And
recent studies indicate that the new drug treatments can protect
stroke victims from potentially devastating brain damage.<P>
For the past several decades, neurologists had nothing to offer
people who had already suffered a stroke. Doctors could
recommend preventative measures for high-risk patients, such as
lowering blood pressure and reducing body weight. Patients who
showed warning signs received anticoagulant drugs, including
aspirin, to prevent the blood clots in the brain that cause
strokes. But there was no way to help once a stroke occurred. As
a result, brain damage from strokes is the leading cause of
adult disability in the U.S., afflicting a total of some three
million people each year.<P>
In December of 1995, however, stroke and its aftermath started
looking more manageable. Researchers at the <A
HREF="http://www.nih.gov/ninds/" >National Institute of 
Neurological Disorders and Stroke</A> described <A
HREF="http://www.nih.gov/ninds/whatsnew/presswhn/1995/ntpapr.htm#t-PA"> encouraging results</A> from advanced clinical trials of a drug
known as tissue plasminogen activator, or tPA. In those trials,
physicians found that tPA, currently used to treat heart
attacks, can also breakup cerebral blood clots, restoring the
flow of blood and thereby preventing brain damage. Patients who
received the drug within three hours of the onset of a stroke
were up to 50 percent more likely than the placebo group to have
minimal or no disabilities three months after the event.<P>
<A HREF="http://www.gene.com/" >Genentech</A>, the maker of tPA,
has since requested approval from the Food and Drug
Administration to market the substance as a stroke therapy; a
decision from the agency could come in the next few months,
according to James C. Grotta, a tPA researcher at the University
of Texas at Houston. Although the drug is not cheap--about
$2,000 a dose--it could keep thousands of patients out of
expensive nursing homes and rehabilitation programs.<P>
Other stroke-treatment compounds also show promise. At the
meeting of the American Academy of Neurology this spring,
research groups announced results from successful, albeit
limited, clinical trials of two such drugs, citicoline and
aptiganel. Both substances appear to help restore the brain's
disrupted chemistry. Citicoline seems to rebuild the membranes
of damaged nerve cells. Aptiganel blocks the entry of excess
calciumin to brain cells (scientists believe high levels of
calcium buildup after a stroke, leading to cell death).<P>
Even more drugs intended to alleviate brain damage from strokes
may be on their way. At the March meeting of the <A
HREF="http://www.acs.org/memgen/meetings/acs211/general/about211.htm"> American Chemical Society</A>, researchers from several drug
companies presented new substances that are just now entering
clinical trials. Thomas M. Bare of Zeneca Pharmaceuticals
reported, for example, preliminary studies of a compound his
group has designated ZD9379. This substance suppresses the
activity of glutamate, an amino acid that, after a stroke,
accumulates in and damages brain cells.<P>
Of course, many promising new drugs never make it through
clinical trials. Ciba-Geigy recently ended its human trial of
selfotel, stating that the drug was not effective enough at
treating stroke to justify continuing the work. <A
HREF="http://www.cnl.salk.edu/NeuroWeb/department/faculty/zivin.html"
>Justin A. Zivin</A> of the San Diego Veterans Administration
Medical Center, who served as a safety monitor for some of the
selfotel trials, believes the study ended in part because of the
drug's side effects, which included hallucinations and
agitation.<P>
Some researchers argue that such neurological side effects may
be difficult to avoid. <A
HREF="http://cpmcnet.columbia.edu/dept/cerebro/Mohr.html" >Jay
P. Mohr</A> of Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center suggests
that perhaps "some behavioral response is necessary to indicate
that the drug is working." He compares the side effects of
stroke therapies to the hair loss that accompanies chemotherapy.
And Elkan R. Gamzu, president of Cambridge NeuroScience, points
out that these effects seem to be more unpleasant than
dangerous.<P>
Shepherding new drugs though human trials is also hampered by
difficulties in dispensing medication at the right time. Doctors
must administer tPA between three and six hours after a stroke
begins; previous studies suggest that administering tPA too late
could cause internal bleeding in the brain. Agents such
asciticoline and aptiganel are somewhat less time sensitive;
they can be provided effectively as long as 24 hours after the
stroke. Yet most victims do not immediately recognize the
warning signs, and so do not even check into a hospital until at
least 24 hours after the attack.<P>
The rise of chemical treatments is encouraging a new focus on
prompt response after a stroke, both by patients and by
physicians. Karen Putney, vice president of the <A
HREF="http://www.stroke.org/index.html" >National Stroke
Association</A>, emphasizes that the main hurdle for treatment
is that "patients are not coming in early enough." Maybe
improved prospects of recovery will entice them into the
emergency room. As Zivin puts it, "neurologists are good at
making a diagnosis, but now they will have to become actively
involved in making people better."<P>

<BR>Across the nation, insomniacs, the sick and
the simply curious are gobbling up melatonin. The hormone is
being touted in the<A
HREF="http://www.tenzing.com/mnews.html"> popular press</A> as a
natural way to get a better night's sleep, to improve one's sex
life, to live longer and to fight the ravages of AIDS,
Alzheimer's disease and cancer, among other
afflictions.<P>
Boosted by cover stories in Newsweek and by a
rash of<A
HREF="http://www.melatonin.com/melartic.htm"> uncritical
books</A>, melatonin seems to have taken over from beta carotene
as pop medicine's Next Big Thing. (Beta carotene, another
natural substance, recently disappointed enthusiasts when a <A
HREF="http://www.oncolink.upenn.edu/pdq/400048.html">clinical trial</A>
found that it not only fails to prevents cancer in smokers, but
may actually promote it.)<P>
A backlash against melatonin hype is
now under way. Critics warn that the doses of melatonin commonly
sold in health food stores--which raise levels of the substance
in the blood 30-fold higher than their normal peak--could be
dangerous for some people. And many researchers and fad-watchers
point out that the more startling claims being made for the
substance are unsupported by studies on patients. They are,
rather. starry-eyed extrapolations from experiments conducted on
rats and mice. These animals differ from people in many ways,
especially as regards sleep, the one aspect of human physiology
that melatonin clearly affects.<P>
Richard Wurtman, a researcher
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has spent years <A
HREF="http://aeiveos.com/diet/melatonin/mlref/authors/Wurtman-RJ/">studying
melatonin</A> and its biological effects. He has described some
of that work in a Scientific American <A
HREF="0189wurtman.html">article</A> ("Carbohydrates and
Depression" by Richard J. Wurtman and Judith J. Wurtman in SA,
January 1989). Wurtman says there is "no controversy" that the
substance, in doses of a fraction of a milligram, can induce
sleep and shift the sleep cycle. Summaries of his findings
appear in an <A
HREF="http://web.mit.edu:1962/tiserve.mit.edu/9000/35029.html">M.I.T.
press release</A>.<P>
But Wurtman, the named inventor on an
M.I.T. patent covering the use of melatonin for controlling
sleep, says there is "no evidence" that it has any effect on
human life expectancy, and "only marginal" evidence that it
promotes longevity in mice. Wurtman further maintains that
health-food store doses of melatonin might diminish sex drive.
He also denounces as "wicked" the suggestion that people with
cancer or AIDS should take the hormone: Wurtman thinks melatonin
is as likely to worsen those conditions as to ease
them.<P>
Wurtman is not the only researcher criticizing melatonin
mania. In an <A
HREF="http://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/minirep.html">article
published in Cell</A>, Steven M. Reppert and David R. Weaver of
Harvard Medical School recently described as "seriously flawed"
an experiment by <A
HREF="http://aeiveos.com/au/pierpaoli-w/">Walter Pierpaoli</A>,
<A HREF="http://aeiveos.com/au/regelson-w/">William Regelson</A>
and others that kindled hopes melatonin might extend life.<P>
The
investigators prolonged the life of elderly mice by giving them
transplants of tissue from the pineal gland (an organ that
responds to melatonin in the bloodstream) taken from younger
mice. Pierpaoli and Regelson hypothesized that the transplanted
tissue was more responsive to melatonin and somehow revitalized
the old mice. But according to Reppert and Weaver, the mice used
in the experiments have a genetic defect that means they cannot
make melatonin; attributing the effect to the hormone is
therefore "absurd."<P>
Regelson and Pierpaoli's book "The
Melatonin Miracle" (<A
HREF="http://aeiveos.com/books/0684813351/1335cont.html">a
chapter outline is available</A>) is one of the most
unrestrained of the current crop. Regelson asserts that he and
Pierpauli wrote their book because pharmaceutical companies are
likely to drag their heels on melatonin research, owing to the
difficulty of patenting a substance found in nature, whereas "I
am 70 years old and I have a time constraint."<P>
But <A
HREF="http://x.biochem.nwu.edu/ibis/turek.html">Fred W.
Turek</A> of Northwestern University, writing in <I><A
HREF="http://www.nature.com/">Nature</A></I>, points out that
"not one study" in humans supports Pierpaoli and Regelson's
claim that, for example, melatonin helps to prevent heart
attacks. Victor Herbert and Ruth Cava of the American Council on
Science and Health caution that children, women who are nursing
or who may become pregnant, and people who have immune-system
disorders should avoid taking the hormone because of
uncertainties about its effects.<P>
The Food and Drug
Administration is collecting occasional reports of ill-effects
from melatonin, but says it will not control the compound unless
a study clearly shows that its consumption is harmful. As for
the promised benefits of melatonin, a good deal more research is
needed to demonstrate if it truly has uses beyond a sleep aid.
See, for instance, a sober <A
HREF="http://healthnet.ivi.com/9511/wa/melato.htm">assessment by
the Mayo Clinic</A>.<P>
Whether established scientists are
willing to take on the task is unclear. The National Institutes
of Health spent $4.8 million in 1995 on sleep studies and
investigations of the effects of melatonin, according to <A
HREF="gopher://gopher.nih.gov/77/gopherlib/indices/crisp/index?melatonin">budget
documents</A>. But, says Andrew A. Monjan, chief of neurobiology
at the National Institute on Aging, the agency "has not received
meritorious research grant applications" to investigate other
uses of the alleged wonder hormone.

<P>Most of the worlds winds blow over the oceans, unseen and
undetected--until now. Last September, the Japanese government
<A HREF="http://yyy.
tksc.nasda.go.jp/Home/Press/Press-e/saishin_e.cgi">launched</A>
the <A HREF="http://echo.gsfc.nasa.gov/adeos/adeos.html ">
Advanced Earth Observing Satellite</A>, which included among its
instruments the NASA Scatterometer, or <A
HREF="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/ winds/nscat/">NSCAT</A>.
<P>This ingenious device uses radar to measure the choppiness of
the ocean surface, and thereby to infer the speed and direction
of the ocean winds (a technique known as <A HREF="http://www.
jpl.nasa.gov/winds/scatterometry/">scatterometry</A>). The first
raw images of NSCAT data, shown here, covering the period from
September 20 to 22, 1996,  offer an early look at the
instrument's capabilities.

This information will improve weather forecasting and storm
warnings, and will aid scientists in their studies of
longer-term climatic variations.  And, as these images show, the
fine resolution of the NSCAT data will improve the monitoring of
typhoons and other kinds of severe storms.  In addition to
<A HREF="110496exhibitB.html">sending back global maps</A> of atmospheric circulation, including regions of ocean
that were not adequately monitored in the past, NSCAT tracked
<A HREF="110496exhibitD.html">two active typhoons</A> off the coast of Japan.
<P>The NSCAT data can also be <A HREF="110496exhibitA.html">superimposed</A> on other
earth-sensing images to provide more valuable data for
meteorologists.

<P><BR CLEAR=ALL><BR>
The earth's dynamic surface is divided into a dozen main crustal
plates whose slipping and sliding unleash volcanoes, build
mountain ranges and trigger earthquakes. But the workings of the
inner world are invisible and frustratingly hard to decipher.
Now <A HREF="http://perry.geo.berkeley.edu/geology/faculty.html#richards">Mark
Richards</A> of the <A HREF="http://perry.geo.berkeley.edu/geology/">University of
California at Berkeley</A> and <A HREF="http://www.acl.lanl.gov/~bunge/">Hans-Peter Bunge</A> of
Los Alamos National Laboratory have created computer simulations
of the earth's interior that show in vivid detail the churning,
convective processes that--literally--rock our world.
<P>These images help to solve a long-standing question of
geophysics. In the simplest earth models, each convective loop
or "cell" is only about as wide as it is deep. <A HREF="090996exhibitbox1.html">That
pattern</A> would indicate that the largest of the plates should
be about as wide as the depth of the earth's mantle, or about
3,000 kilometers. But the Pacific plate spans more than four
times that distance. Richards and Bunge suspected that the
models were ignoring a key factor: the way that the viscosity,
or stickiness, of the hot-mantle rocks changes with depth.

<FONT SIZE="2"><B>Predicting subduction</B></FONT></A></CENTER></TD></TR></TABLE>
To test this theory, the researchers developed a revised model
in which the viscosity of the rock increases by a factor of 30
from the top to the bottom of the mantle. They then used a
massively parallel Cray T3D computer at Los Alamos National
Laboratory to see how well their model accords with reality. The
<A HREF="090996exhibitbox2.html">resulting
simulation</A> matches much better with the real dimensions of
the earth's tectonic plates. Another simulation showing
conditions 300 kilometers below the surface shows how the
variable-viscosity model (at bottom in <A
HREF="http://www.urel.berkeley.edu/urel_1/CampusNews/PressReleases/releases/richards/Mantle_pix/Plateless.jpeg">this
image</A>) accurately depicts the subduction of cool material in
the mantle, whereas the constant-viscosity model (at top) does
not. A full report on this research will appear in the October 1
issue of Geophysical Research Letters.
<P>The work of Richards and Bunge comes on the heels of a number of
other breakthroughs in understanding the earth's deep
insides--detailed <A HREF="http://ees5-www.lanl.gov/IGPP/Geodynamo.html">models of
the dynamo</A> that drives the earth's magnetic field, for
instance, and the discovery of the crystal structure and <A
HREF="http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/song/pr.html">independent
motion</A> of the inner core. Armed with faster computers and
more complete seismic data, geophysicists are making remarkable
progress in unveiling the once secret realms beneath our feet.

<H1 align=center>Great Balls of Ice!</H1>
<BR CLEAR=ALL><BR>
Jupiter's large moon 
<A HREF="http://bang.lanl.gov/solarsys/europa.htm">Europa</A> is a captivating
enigma: smooth as a billiard ball, almost as white as snow, criss-crossed by
a peculiar network of brown fractures. A set of images from the <A
HREF="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/galileo/intro.html">Galileo spacecraft</A> now
orbiting Jupiter add to Europa's allure. They depict a world of complex ice
geology and--most exciting of all--bolster the evidence that the surface ice
may cover a global ocean tens of kilometers deep. Some scientists have even
proposed that Europa's buried ocean <A
HREF="http://www.vsc.washington.edu/academic/499/Resources/europa.html">could
harbor life</A>--though such ideas remain wildly speculative at this point.
<P>The most dramatic of the new images (above) shows a wide swath of Europa's
equatorial region. The cluttered pattern of streaks and cracks looks
like nothing so much as a huge Jackson Pollock painting (although, as yet,
nobody has suggested that it is the work of alien abstract artists!).
Scientists believe we are looking at fractures that divided Europa's frozen
crust into vast plates of ice, as large as 30 kilometers across; the voids
between the plates filled with darker water or slush from below and then
refroze. These formations indicate that Europa once had a warm interior, but
they do not prove that a global ocean still lurks beneath the ice.
<P>

</td></tr></table>
Further clues about Europa's inner nature come from 
another Galileo image which shows a large impact crater--one of the few large ones
visible on Europa's smooth surface. The crater seems to have thrown a layer
of bright, fresh ice onto a darkened region. A dark band in this image
displays a light streak down the middle, possibly produced by ancient
geysers. 
<P>The Galileo imaging team has assembled a 
<A HREF="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/galileo/ganymede/p47183.html">mosaic image</A> 
of Europa that gives a sense of the extraordinary
diversity of the satellite's terrain. Some circular depressions, probably
impact craters, can be seen close to the day-night line, or terminator. The
overall lack of such craters implies that Europa's surface is young and
active; ongoing eruptions of slush or water volcanoes may be renewing the
landscape.
<P>Impressive though they are, these images offer but a taste of things to
come. The smallest details visible here are about two kilometers across.
During three subsequent encounters, Galileo will approach so close to Europa
that it will be able to spot features a mere 11 meters across. Will we find
definitive evidence of a warm (and, just possibly, <A
HREF="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/datamax.html#best">life
-bearing</A>)
ocean under the convoluted ice floes? Stay tuned: the next close approach is
on December 19.

at Ganymede</H1></CENTER><BR CLEAR=ALL><BR>
The <A HREF="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/galileo/overview.html">Galileo
spacecraft</A>, bruised but unbowed, continued its winning streak
as it returned dazzling images of Jupiter's planet-size
satellite, <A HREF="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/galileo/ganymede/fact.html">Ganymede</A>.
A series of snapshots released by NASA on July 10 unveil a
alien-looking world, studded with craters and etched with deep
grooves. Even more surprisingly, something seems to be active
within this seemingly frozen wasteland: Galileo's instruments
reveal that Ganymede has a magnetic field, possibly generated in
a molten core or in a vast subterranean layer of saltwater.<P>
Galileo, which began orbiting Jupiter last December 7, has had
its share of technical difficulties. A faulty main antenna that
never deployed forced engineers to
<A HREF="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/galileo/hga_fact.html">reprogram
the space probe</A>
so that it could radio highly compressed data to Earth through
its tiny backup antenna. The detailed resolution of the current
images is a testament to the success of the program. Galileo flew
within 835 kilometers of Ganymede during its recent encounter.
The just released images, which were mostly taken from a distance
of about 7,500 kilometers, show details a mere 80 meters
across.<P>
By far the most bizarre aspect of Ganymede's face is its strange
network of
<A HREF="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/galileo/ganymede/p47057.html">ridges
and furrows</A>. Unlike terrestrial topography, however, the ups
and downs of Ganymede are carved in ice, not rock. Large parts of
the satellite seem to have been reshaped by ice volcanoes and
tectonic forces that have thrust up icy mountains. The

<A HREF="http://128.165.1.1/solarsys/io.htm">Io</A>, another of Jupiter's giant
satellites. Io is the most volcanically active body in the solar system; its
surface is constantly reshaped by sulfurous eruptions. The

the Voyager spacecraft visited Io 17 years ago; fallout of sulfur and sulfur
dioxide frost has created a huge white area in the satellite's southern
hemisphere. <P>
Planetary scientists are just beginning to digest the meaning of the Galileo
results. Over the next 17 months, the probe will make three more passes by
Ganymede, during which it will map other regions and further study the local
magnetic field. Io too will come under closer scrutiny. And Galileo will

<CENTER><H1>Cracking Open<BR>AIDS's Shell</H1></CENTER>
This striking ribbon diagram may hold a key to foiling the virus that causes AIDS.
For the first time, scientists have been able to peer deep inside
the <A HREF="071596exhibit2.jpg">human immunodeficiency
virus</A> (HIV-1) and describe the structure of a fragment from
an egglike shell, or capsid, that envelops the genetic material
within the virus. Such information is likely to help researchers
locate chinks in the armor of HIV-1. <P>
The image was created by <A HREF="http://www.research.umbc.edu/%7Esmith/chem/summers/mfs.html">Michael
F. Summers</A>, Rossitza K. Gitti, Brian M. Lee and Jill Walker,
investigators with the <A HREF="http://www.hhmi.org/">Howard

from the <A HREF="http://www.utah.edu/HTML_Docs/UofU_Home.html">University of
Utah</A>.
In a report in the <A HREF="http://science-mag.aaas.org/science/scripts/display/short/273/5272/231.html">July
12 issue of Science</A>, the researchers display a detailed
picture of the central region of the HIV-1 capsid (CA) protein--the
molecule that makes up the shell containing the RNA and enzymes
necessary for HIV-1 to replicate and infect its host.
Computer-analyzed magnetic resonance imaging was used to decipher
the molecule's complicated structure. <P>
Summers and his collaborators, who have been pursuing the
structure of the CA protein for six years, were stunned when they
looked at their results. The protein is almost entirely composed
of <A HREF="http://www.pdb.bnl.gov/PPS/course/3_geometry/helix1.html">alpha
helices</A>--the dominant corkscrew pattern seen here, in which
the amino acids that make up the protein wind into a hollow
cylinder shape. The alpha helices are disrupted by two abrupt 
<A HREF="http://www.pdb.bnl.gov/PPS/course/3_geometry/hairpin.html">"beta
hairpin turns,"</A> or U-turns, as well as by a looplike
formation. Such a structure has never before been seen among the
proteins that make up the shields surrounding the genetic
material in viruses.<P>

The detailed new map of the CA protein will be of great interest
to drug developers. Nestled within the protein is the binding
site of cyclophilin A, an enzyme found in blood cells. HIV-1
snatches cyclophilin A from the cells it invades and incorporates
the molecule into its own structure. <A HREF="http://hs1310racaniello.cpmc.columbia.edu/Micro_Files/Luban_Lab.html">Jeremy
Luban</A> and his colleagues at Columbia University have shown
that if cyclophilin A is not present and bound by CA, then HIV-1
cannot replicate. Hence, if there is a way to block cyclophilin A
from binding with the CA protein, it could be possible to
neutralize the AIDS virus.<P>

<CENTER><H1>A Different View<BR>of the Sun</H1></CENTER>
A group of new orbiting instruments is sending back surprising
images of our best-known star, the Sun.  The composite images
shown here represent four days (June 16-19) of recent
observations in the extreme ultraviolet by <A HREF="http://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov/">Solar and
Heliospheric Observatory</A>
(SOHO)
These and images in other wavelengths are posted to the Internet
on a <A HREF="http://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/imagemap/soho?265,571">daily basis</A> by
researchers from the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration and the European Space Agency, who are
collaborating on the project.<P>
SOHO  was launched by NASA Dec. 2, 1995 from Cape Canaveral Air
Station in Florida. It was designed and built in Europe; NASA
provided the launch and is operating the satellite from its
Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. European scientists
provided eight of the observatory's instruments and US
scientists a further three.  In late April, SOHO reached its
final destination near the L-1 Lagrangian point, where the
Earth's and Sun's gravitational forces balance, some one million
miles sunward from the Earth. This vantage point enables solar
astronomers to observe the Sun continuously, with no intervening
"night."<P>
The spacecraft's mission is to study the internal structure of
the Sun, its extensive outer atmosphere and the origin of the
solar wind, the stream of highly ionized gas that blows
continuously outward through the Solar System.  It was
specifically designed to observe the Sun during a supposedly
"quiet" period near the bottom of its 11-year sunspot cycle,
when solar disturbances are at a minimum and the undisturbed
solar atmosphere and interior could best be studied.<P>
But <A HREF="http://umbra.nascom.nasa.gov/soho/ssu/ssu_stills.html">initial observations</A> from
SOHO revealed that the "quiet" sun is far from quiescent.  The
spacecraft's Extreme-ultraviolet Imaging Telescope revealed
unexpected activity on the Sun and the best views yet of the
sources of strange, chaotic "plume" structures that extend from
the solar poles to high altitudes within its outer atmosphere,
or corona.<P>
<A HREF="http://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov/synoptic/soho_movie.html">Dramatic movies</A> from
SOHO have revealed the source areas of the long, feathery plumes
that extend from regions near the poles of the Sun to more than
13 million miles into interplanetary space.  The sequences of
ultraviolet images show the polar plumes standing in the solar
wind, an outward streaming of electrified gas from the corona. 
The movies clearly reveal the bases of the plumes, never
characterized before, to be seething regions of wildly gyrating
magnetic fields and turbulent solar gases.<P>
A chief aim of the SOHO polar plume research is to see if plumes
can be positively identified as the sources of high-speed
streams of solar wind that were directly sampled by the European
Space Agency's Ulysses spacecraft when it passed over the poles
of the Sun in 1994 and 1995.  Another instrument on SOHO, the
<A HREF="http://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov/data/summary/gif/960621/slas_c3wlc_fd_19960621_1431.gif">Large-Angle Spectroscopic Coronagraph</A> (LASCO)
images the plumes as far as 30 solar radii from the surface of
the Sun.  (The radius of the Sun is about 440,000 miles.)<P>
SOHO is also probing the sun's interior structure with
instruments that detect variations in the intensity of light or
its wavelength --SOHO's Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) measures
underlying magnetic fields and gas flow patterns on the solar
surface.  The <A HREF="http://soi.stanford.edu/">Solar Oscillations Investigation</A> (SOI) uses the Michelson Doppler Imager
(MDI) instrument to probe the interior of the Sun.<P>
The data sent back by MDI will be analyzed along with that
collected by other groups peering beneath the solar surface. 
For example, a Japanese satellite called Yohkoh is returning
<A HREF="http://www.space.lockheed.com/SXT/html2/data.html">spectacular images</A> of the sun taken
in x-rays that can be <A HREF="http://www.space.lockheed.com/YPOP/movies/new_movies.html">viewed as movies</A>. Its
Soft X-ray Telescope (SXT) was developed by the Lockheed Palo
Alto Research Laboratory, the National Astronomical Observatory
of Japan, and the University of Tokyo.<P>
Similarly, a collaboration of earth-bound researchers known as
<A HREF="http://helios.tuc.noao.edu/">GONG</A>, are applying the
techniques of seismology to building models of the Sun's
interior. GONG stands for Global Oscillation Network Group, an
array of six identical instruments spread around the globe that
provide essentially continuous observations of the sun.  Like
others, these researchers have also displayed their findings as
<A HREF="http://helios.tuc.noao.edu/movies.html">movies</A>.<P>
The GONG researchers are using a technique called
helioseismology. Like terrestrial seismology, it utilizes the
low-frequency sound waves that propagate throughout the Sun to
measure, for the first time, the invisible internal structure
and dynamics of a star. By analyzing the myriad waves that
appear and dissipate across the sun, researchers can gather
information about virtually any point of the sun's interior and
can, for the first time, confirm the details of theoretical
models about the sun - and raise some interesting problems for
further consideration. A group of papers by the GONG researchers
were published in the May 31 issue of <I><A HREF="http://science-mag.aaas.org/science/content/vol272/issue5266/#special">Science</A>.</I><P>
As our nearest star, the Sun has always been in the forefront of
astrophysics. These new images provide a clearer picture and
will surely lead to theoretical insights.<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
This spectacular image of a nearby galaxy, NGC 55, captures huge
filaments, loops and "bubbles" of ionized hydrogen gas thousands
of light years across. These structures probably result from
material blown outward by many generations of massive stars in
galaxy. NGC 55 is an irregular galaxy that has hints of spiral
structure; it is similar to the <A HREF="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap950918.html">Large Magellanic Cloud</A>, a companion
to the Milky Way that is visible in the southern sky. NGC 55
resides in a relatively nearby gathering of galaxies, the
Sculptor Group, which is located about 5 million light years
from the earth.<P>
Annette Ferguson of Johns Hopkins University presented this new
view of NGC 55 on June 11 at a meeting of the American
Astronomical Society in Madison, Wisc. She and a number of
colleagues created the image using the 1.5-meter optical
telescope at the <A HREF="http://ctio.noao.edu/ctio.html">Cerro Tololo Inter-American
Observatory</A> in Chile. To
capture the many faint details of the galaxy's structure,
Ferguson's team made a composite of observations from September,
1994 and from September, 1995.<P>
Astronomers theorize that the tangled protrusions from NGC 55
resulted from disruptions caused by a class of hot, rapidly
evolving stars within the galaxy. These stars, which have at
least ten times the mass of the sun, shine brilliantly and eject
material in powerful stellar winds. When such massive stars
exhaust their nuclear fuel, they undergo cataclysmic
detonations-- <A HREF="http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/RGO/leaflets/supernovae/supernovae.html">supernova
explosions</A>--which
blast away the star's outer layers. The combination of stellar
winds and supernova explosions sculpts the interstellar hydrogen
gas into the bubbles and filaments seen in this image.<P>
Similar formations are seen in some other galaxies, most notably
M82, an
object so roiled by stellar evolution that astronomers once
mistakenly considered it an exploding galaxy.<P>
Energetic photons from the hot stars ionize the hydrogen,
removing each atom's single electron. These loose electrons soon
"recombine" with bare hydrogen nuclei (protons), releasing
energy in the process. That energy appears in the form of light
of a specific wavelength--6,563 Angstroms (an Angstrom is one
ten billionth of a meters), which falls toward the red end of
the visible spectrum. Ferguson and her colleagues used a special
filter, limiting their observations to this narrow band of the
spectrum. For comparison, take a look at <A HREF="http://www.aao.gov.au/image/aat102.gif">unfiltered
color</A> and black-and-
white images of the galaxy.<P>
Observations such as this one demonstrate that, despite the
successes of the orbiting <A HREF="http://www.stsci.edu/public.html">Hubble Space
Telescope</A>, breathtaking
research can still be done from the ground. If anything, there
has been a resurgence in the building of new terrestrial
instruments that deliver unprecedented clarity at a variety of
wavelengths.<P>
Until recently, the 10-meter Keck
Telescope on Mauna Kea,
Hawaii, was the world's largest optical telescope. Now it has a
twin: on May 8, scientists formally dedicated the Keck II
Telescope, located next to Keck I atop the 13,796-foot dormant
volcano. Keck II will incorporate three specialized
spectrographs--instruments for recording an object's spectrum--
that will complement the capabilities of the five-year-old Keck
I.<P>
Even more exciting, the two telescopes are designed to work
together as an interferometer--a system in which light from two
or more telescope is brought together so that the light waves
combine and interfere with each other. This new technique of
<A HREF="http://www.sciam.com/WEB/0796issue/0796techbus02.html">optical interferometry</A> can
yield extremely high-resolution images, essentially allowing the
two telescopes to function as a single, enormous instrument.
Because Keck I and Keck II are some 85 meters (nearly 280 feet)
apart, they will have a resolving power equivalent to that of a
telescope with an 85-meter mirror, or about 0.005 arc seconds at
infrared wavelengths. That is about ten times the precision of
the Hubble Space Telescope.<P>
Also at the June meeting of the American Astronomical Society,
astronomers from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst and
the Instituto Nacional de Astrofosica, Optica y Electronica in
Puebla, Mexico revealed plans to build one of the world's
largest high-precision radiotelescopes. Dubbed the <A HREF="http://www-astro.phast.umass.edu/gradprog/lmt.html">Large
Millimeter Wave Telescope</A> (LMT), the 50-meter
instrument will be constructed over the next five years on a
yet-to-be selected mountain site in Mexico.<P>
Millimeter waves (shorter than the waves observed by conventional
radio telescopes) can penetrate through dust clouds and
interstellar haze, revealing the hidden details of star birth,
planetary formation and other mysterious astronomical processes.
When completed, the LMT's huge dish-shaped antenna will stand
taller than a 16-story building, and be able to point to a
cosmic source with an accuracy of 1/1,000th of a degree (about
four arc- seconds). It will also provide a view of the southern
sky that is relatively unexplored, and which includes the center
of our <A HREF="http://www.aao.gov.au/image/aat028.gif">Milky Way</A> galaxy.<P>

One of the great drawbacks of placing a precious object, such as
the Hope Diamond, in a museum is that it is then only visible to
the tiny portion of the public that happens to live nearby--or
that happens to have the time and money to go there. At least,
that used to be a necessary drawback, before the rise of the
Internet.<P>
As museums grow more computer-savvy and take advantage of
increasing bandwidth, many of them are starting to offer virtual
tours of their collections, often including images available
only in cyberspace. At the same time, some government
institutions, university laboratories and even enterprising
individuals are placing their own high-quality images online.
Armchair travelers now find they have numerous choices when they
want to visit to a well-curated science museum or exhibit on the
Web.<P>
Our tour might as well begin in someplace remote--why not take
advantage of those international phone lines? Singapore's
<A HREF="http://www.museum.org.sg/nhb.html">National Heritage Board</A> maintains a fast,
graphically meticulous site (what else?) that contains a nice
selection of images of Asian culture, art, artifacts and modern
lifestyles. The <A HREF="http://www.webmedia.com.au/tandanya/Tandanya.html">Tandanya National Aboriginal Cultural Institute</A> documents
works by the aboriginal peoples of Australia. Even at the
<A HREF="http://www.umma.lsa.umich.edu/">University of Michigan's Museum of Anthropology</A> there is a taste of the
exotic: currently on display are paintings from New Guinea and
Tankas (painted cloths) from Tibet.<P>
Web museums let you travel through time as well as through
space. <A HREF="http://galileo.imss.firenze.it/index.html">The History of Science Museum</A> in Florence houses
an intriguing collection of artifacts connected with Galileo
Galilei--including, astoundingly enough, the preserved middle
finger of the great scientist's right hand. For those who cannot
get enough Galileo memorabilia, more can be found on the web
site of the <A HREF="http://www.pd.astro.it/TNG/galileo.html">Telescopio Nazionale GALILEO</A>, also in Italy;
continuing the gruesome theme, Telescopio Nazionale offers a
look at Galileo's fifth lumbar vertebra. (Intrigued by anatomy?
Visit the <A HREF="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/visible/photos.html">Visible Human Project</A>, which
has released to the public some mind-bending images of sectional
slices of a human cadaver.)<P>
For a journey much farther into the past, drop by one of the two
excellent dinosaur museums on the Internet: the University of
<A HREF="http://ucmp1.berkeley.edu/">California Museum of Paleontology</A>
and the <A HREF="http://tyrrell.magtech.ab.ca/tour/dinohall.html">Royal Tyrrell Museum's dinosaur hall</A>. (In fact,
the entire <A HREF="http://tyrrell.magtech.ab.ca/index.html">Royal Tyrrell Museum</A>, located in
Drumheller, Alberta, is well worth a look.) A more commercial
view of dinosaurs is available at the <A HREF="http://www.indyrad.iupui.edu/dinoart.html">Dinosaur Art and Modeling</A> site.<P>
Other relics from the depths of geologic history can be found in
the charmingly no-frills <A HREF="http://geology.wisc.edu/%7Ejill/image.html">Gem and Gemology Image Gallery</A>, located at the
University of Wisconsin. The <A HREF="http://galaxy.einet.net/images/gems/gems-icons.html">Smithsonian Gem and Mineral Collection</A> contains
a truly staggering collection of images, including the renowned
Hope Diamond.<P>
The main <A HREF="http://www.si.edu/welcome/musovrvw/start.htm">Smithsonian Institution site</A> serves as a
general starting point for visiting the Institution's many
museums. Do not overlook the rich database maintained by
<A HREF="http://photo2.si.edu/">Smithsonian Photographic Services</A>. Not
all of the Smithsonian museums offer extensive online images,
although the National Air and Space Museum has done a nice job
in placing its controversial <A HREF="http://www.nasm.edu/NASMDOCS/NASMAP.html">Enola Gay exhibit</A> on the Web.<P>
Continuing upward from the Air and Space Museum, try out the
sobering <A HREF="http://www.fourmilab.ch/earthview/vplanet.html">Earth Viewer</A> (a bit slow
but worth the wait), which generates interactive views of the
earth as seen from a wide variety of perspectives--if you ever
wanted to watch a sunset from the Hubble Space Telescope, this
is your chance.<P>
<A HREF="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html">Astronomy Picture of the Day</A> provides a
regular astronomy fix and includes a substantial image archive.
Our tour ends at the <A HREF="http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/photo_gallery/photogallery.html">National Space Science Data Center</A>,
which has collected what might be considered the mother of all
exhibits: highlights of just about every kind of astronomical
object, presented in a tidy and entirely manageable format. It
is the kind of museum that truly would be a nuisance to visit
without the aid of the Internet.<P>

VANISHINGLY SMALL MACHINES like the ones envisioned here 
could someday serve as tiny mechanical doctors. These miniature

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Nanotechnology is the blanket term used to describe the precision 
manufacture of materials and structures of molecular dimensions. 
Many of the goals of nanotechnology were expressed nearly 40 years 
ago by the renowned physicist <A HREF="http://nano.xerox.com/nanotech/feynman.html">Richard P. Feynman</A>. Molecular-scale 
robots currently exist only in the imaginations of nanotechnologists 
and the artists who depict their ideas. But some technological 
visionaries, led by <A HREF="http://www.foresight.org/Drexler.html">K. Eric Drexler</A>, think that the dream will 
soon become a reality that will transform everything from health care 
to food production. (Drexler's ideas are outlined in his book 
<A HREF="http://reality.sgi.com/whitaker/EnginesOfCreation/EOC_TOC.html">Engines of Creation</A>).<P>
Engineers have developed tiny gears and motors that hint at the 
promise of making such molecular devices; researchers at Sandia National
Laboratories in Albuquerque, New Mexico
recently announced the creation of <A HREF="http://www.sandia.gov/LabNews/LN03-15-96/intell.html">"intelligent" micromachines</A> that 
incorporate integrated-circuit controllers. <P>
New tools like scanning <A HREF="http://www.cs.unc.edu/nano/etc/www/nanopage.html">tunneling microscopes</A> permit the 
manipulation of individual atoms. Drexler and other nanovisionaries 
believe that this invention marks a step toward the manufacture of 
<A HREF="http://www.wag.caltech.edu/gallery/gallery_nanotec.html">molecular gears</A> and 
other components needed for constructing nanometer-scale (billionth 
of a meter) machines.<P>
Despite such advances, many researchers consider Drexler's goals for 
molecular nanotechnology to be a pie-in-the-sky fantasy, as described 
in a recent Scientific American article (see "<A HREF="./040000trends.html">Waiting for 
Breakthroughs</A>," by Gary Stix; Scientific 
American, April 1996). That article has prompted a <A HREF="http://www.foresight.org/SciAmResponse.html">vehement rebuttal</A> from the 
Foresight Institute, written by <A HREF="http://merkle.com/merkle">Ralph C. Merkle</A> of Xerox PARC in Palo Alto, Calif.<P>

This spectacular view of the <A 
HREF="http://www.stsci.edu/pubinfo/PR/96/18/A.html">sun setting over 
Saturn's rings</A> is part of a
group of images recently released by the Space 
Telescope Science Institute that
takes advantage of an unusual alignment among the sun, Earth and 
Saturn (the images also celebrate the Hubble Space Telescope's <A 
HREF="http://www.stsci.edu/pubinfo/PR/96/10.html">sixth 
anniversary</A>).<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
During this 
rare astronomical event, known as a <A 
HREF="http://www.stsci.edu/pubinfo/SaturnRPC.html">Saturn
ring-plane 
crossing,</A> the planet's beautiful, mysterious rings appear edge on to 
terrestrial viewers. In the current crossing, the
Earth passed through the 
plane of Saturn's rings three times, on May 22 and August 10 of 1995 and on 
February 11, 1996; the Sun passed through the ring plane once, on November 
19,
1995. All but the February 11 event were visible to the
Space 
Telescope.<P>
<A 
HREF="http://ringside.arc.nasa.gov/www/saturn/saturn.html">Saturn's 
complex system of rings</A> is so thin, the edge-on view makes 
them almost
invisible from Earth, just as a sheet of paper would be 
invisible
if viewed perfectly edge-on from a distance. In the absence of the 
usual
bright glare of sunlight reflected from the rings, astronomers
could 
study the vertical structure within
the rings; search for faint, undiscovered 
Saturnian moons; and measure the tenuous "atmosphere" that surrounds the 
rings like a halo. The Hubble Space Telescope participated in all of these 
observations.<P>
The recent ring crossing was literally a once-in-a-lifetime 
opportunity for many
astronomers.  The orbital configuration that causes the 
rings
to appear edge-on occurs roughly every 15 years. But the next two
times 
it happens, Saturn will be situated nearly on the other side of the
sun and 
hence out of the Earth's view. The next chance to get a good
edge-on view of 
Saturn's ring system will not occur again until a
triple passage in 2038-
39.<P>
The Space Telescope did not disappoint astronomers.  It recorded <A 
HREF="http://www.stsci.edu/pubinfo/PR/96/16/A.html">starkly
beautiful 
images</A> of the rings edge on. 
It also collected a sequence of spectacular 
pictures of <A 
HREF="http://www.stsci.edu/pubinfo/PR/96/18/B.html">Saturn's 
moons</A>.<P>
Much of the data collected during the ring crossing are 
still
being interpreted. But already, the observations are leading into 
intriguing new insights into the nature of Saturn's rings.  Researchers 
have
known for decades that the rings are composed of innumerable particles 
(ranging in size from fine dust to chunks the size of a house),
each composed 
at least in part of frozen water. One theory about
how the ring system formed 
is that small icy moons in orbit around Saturn collided with comets or 
meteoroids. The moons would have shattered, their debris gradually 
dispersing around
Saturn to become part of the intricate system of 
rings.<P>
If that is the case, scientists wonder, how often do such 
events
happen, and how long do the rings survive? Astronomers long ago 
predicted that the rings must experience a kind of erosion process. 
Bombardment by solar
radiation, charged particles, dust-size meteorites or 
other ring
particles would dehydrate the icy ring particles, blowing off an 
extended but very thin cloud of water vapor. Solar radiation would then
split 
the water vapor molecules into
hydrogen atoms and hydroxyl molecules (an 
atom of hydrogen bound to an atom of oxygen).<P>
A team of investigators 
used the Hubble to search for hydroxyl emissions and reported their findings
in the journal <A 
HREF="http://science-
mag.aaas.org/science/scripts/display/short/272/5261/516.html">Science</A>. 
They
confirmed the reality of this erosion process and determined that the 
ring system is losing up to 3,000 kilograms
(6,600 pounds) of frozen water per 
second. Even at this rate,
the researchers estimate that the rings probably 
will survive at
least another billion years. Based solely on the measured 
erosion rate,
the rings might have formed a billion or more years ago.<P> 
Other studies, also based in part on Hubble observations, provide more 
information about the dynamics of the ring system. Gravitational
interactions 
between Saturn's satellites and the ring particles, should cause the rings
to 
spiral slowly into the planet. Calculations indicate that this process
should 
clear out the rings over a period of about 100 million years, which suggests
that we are fortunate to be seeing Saturn during a comparatively brief
ringed 
period. Hubble studies of the motions of the inner satellites (possible only
during ring crossing) were supposed to help settle the age of the rings; 
instead, it seems that even the satellites follow complicated, difficult-to-
predict paths. <P> At least Hubble has helped nail down the thickness of the
rings: no more than 1.5 kilometers thick at the outer "F ring," as reported
in 
another paper in <A HREF="http://science-
mag.aaas.org/science/scripts/display/short/272/5261/509.html">Science</A>, 
and probably much thinner closer in.  <P>
Hubble was hardly the 
only telescope observing the
ring crossing; ground-based telescopes around 
the world were
also pointed at the ringed planet.  These included 
observatories at
Kitt Peak (near Tucson, Arizona), Pic-du-Midi, France, the 
Canary
Islands; and the European Southern Observatory in 
Chile.
Complementary observations made at near-infrared wavelengths, just 
longer than visible light, were conducted at Palomar Observatory,
California; 
NASA's Infrared Telescope Facility, Hawaii; Pic du
Midi; and Calar Alto, 
Spain.<P>
<A 
HREF="http://newproducts.jpl.nasa.gov/saturn/herschel.html">Terrestrial 
images</A> may lack
the crisp clarity of those from Hubble, but they 
remain extremely important to astronomers. Researchers working 
at Kitt Peak, for
example, <A 
HREF="http://newproducts.jpl.nasa.gov/saturn/anim5.html">prepared 
animations</A>
of images made during the ring crossing; these will be 
analyzed to search for even
fainter moons or ring clumps not evident in single 
images.<P>

<H2>Cities Over Time</H2>
"Temporal mapping" provides<BR>insights into urban growth.<P><BR><BR>
</CENTER>


Traditional maps provide a way to visualize a wide range of static data. 
Here a group of cartographers, geographers, environmentalists and
demographers have created a dynamic map that uses computer
animation to show urban growth over time--in this case 200
years of development in the Baltimore-Washington region.<P>
<BR CLEAR=ALL><BLOCKQUOTE>
The goal of the project is to provide urban planners with a
visual means of studying the growth of metropolitan areas--and to allow
them to project the impact of future development.  The animation
you see here consists of just <A HREF="galfeat042896a.html">four frames</A> 
taken from a far more extensive computer simulation.<P>

The animation was prepared by the <A
HREF="http://research.umbc.edu/~tbenja1/bwhp/projover.html">Baltimore-Washington
Regional
Collaboratory</A>, a cooperative effort
between several universities and agencies, including the University of
Maryland Baltimore County, <a href =
"http://mercury.hq.nasa.gov/office/mtpe/"> the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration's Mission to Planet Earth</A>,
and the <A HREF="http://www.usgs.gov/">U.S. Geological Survey</A> (USGS).
The project
was unveiled on April 22 in Baltimore during the annual
convention of the American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote
Sensing and the American Congress on Surveying and Mapping. In the images
shown here, the red areas represent "urbanization"--places in which
much of the land is covered by structures. <P>

This real-world "SimCity" is an example of <A
HREF="http://edcwww2.cr.usgs.gov/umap/umap.html">temporal urban mapping</A>.
This technique relies on modern
mapping techniques, such as remote sensing and geographic
information systems, to capture information from both
historical and modern records. The database highlights the
profound changes to the landscape over time.<P>

The researchers involved in the project have reconstructed urban growth
patterns for specific years since 1792 by examining historical maps and
census data gathered from the
Library of Congress, the U.S. Bureau of the Census, the USGS and the
Maryland Historical Society. Data from the Bureau of the Census
were used to identify the beginning of villages that might not
have yet been represented on historical maps. All of that information was
combined with current land satellite images. Workers at the Goddard Space
Flight Center also provided real-time
satellite data. A computer algorithm then projected likely growth from
one key year to the next, based on records concerning the
appearance of houses, roads, villages, towns and commercial land
areas.  The Collaboratory project also tracked coastal water changes in
the Chesapeake Bay region.<P>

Planners working with the database can produce map animations that show
specific features, such as roads or forests. For example, the
Chesapeake Bay Regional Ecosystem Group plans to correlate the
decrease of water quality to urban growth.  The data can be 
<A HREF="http://www.nasm.edu:2020/CEPSDOCS/BALT/images.html">displayed</A>
on various backgrounds, such as shaded relief or
digital elevation models.<P>

Perhaps the most important aspect of the Collaboratory project will be its
ability to predict future changes. Some planners are
already working with the model to find ways to forecast the
impact of human activity in the region, such as new roads, shopping
malls and mass-transit systems.<P>

"A historical perspective of urban development provides insights
into future development and expansion trends," says William
Acevedo, a physical scientist with the <A
HREF="http://geo.arc.nasa.gov/usgs/erosames.html">USGS EROS Ames Research
Group</A> in Moffett Field, California. "It is extremely
important that we understand the spatial dynamics of urban sprawl
so that future patterns of land use and land cover can be
projected, planned, and managed under sustainable conditions."<P>

Additional images, descriptions of research projects, underlying
data and other information are available from the
<A HREF="http://www.umbc.edu/bwrdc">Baltimore-Washington Regional
Collaboratory</A>.  There are also <A

<FONT size=4><B><A NAME="acs86">
"Is it possible that a meteorite could strike a commercial airliner and
cause it to explode? Could this possibly have caused the crash of TWA Flight 800?"
</A></B></FONT>

<P>--<I>Katherine Watson<BR>Address Withheld</I>

<P>This is a highly controversial question. There are no documented instances of a
meteorite striking an airplane, nor has the Federal Bureau of Investigation
released any official statement on the likely effects of such an impact, either
in general or in the case of Flight 800. (In a recent interview, FBI assistant
director James Kallstrom stated that his agency had looked into the
meteorite-impact theory and considered it possible but "highly unlikely" and
noted that there is no evidence of such an occurrence.) Even the process of
calculating the odds of a meteorite striking an aircraft is filled with
uncertainties. For instance, which probability is more relevant: the (minuscule)
odds that Flight 800 was struck by a meteorite, or the odds that a meteorite
would have struck <I> any</I> airplane since the dawn of commercial aviation?
Moreover, a meteorite impact need not be a catastrophic event. Presumably, it
would cause a deadly explosion only if it hit a critical part of aircraft, a
consideration which adds another unknown into the equation.<P>

With those caveats in mind, here are two responses to the question:<P>

<A
HREF="http://www.astro.columbia.edu:80/dept/research/helfand/helfand.html"TARGET="_top">David
J. Helfand</A>, chair of the department of astronomy at Columbia University,
offers his insight into the question:<P>

"On September 19, 1996, my colleague <A
HREF="http://www.astro.columbia.edu/dept/research/Hailey/Hailey.html"TARGET="_top">Charles
Hailey</A> and I published a Letter to the Editor of <I>The New York Times</I> in
which we established the probability of a meteor striking a commercial aircraft
with sufficient kinetic energy to damage the plane (the meteor would not have to
be larger than a baseball, we guess). We did this calculation in response to the
repeated public claims by officials who stated that the odds of such an event
were hopelessly remote. Neither of us is an engineer, so we want to emphasize
that we have no real insight into the probability that the plane would explode as
a result of such a collision. We have only looked at the likelihood that a
collision could take place.<P>

"It is critical to pose this problem properly. It is an <I>a posteriori</I>
calculation if we just talk about TWA Flight 800; the odds of that particular
flight being hit by a meteor are very small indeed. But the appropriate question
to ask in this situation is, 'What are the odds, throughout the history of
commercial aviation, of a meteor striking an airplane such that it would
penetrate the plane's fuel tanks?' We considered the number of planes in the
world, the fraction of the time they spend in the air, their size, and the number
of meteors entering the atmosphere per day, etc. Based on those numbers, we
derived a probability of about 10 percent.<P>

"We thought this estimate was worth considering (in light of the lack of evidence
for other theories), although all attempts to contact officials were deflected.
After the publication of our <I>New York Times</I> letter, we received dozens of
previous, unpublished letters sent to the Times that offered the same theory,
though none of these contained a probability calculation."<P>

<A
HREF="http://tutlab2.physics.rhodes.edu/faculty_homepages/g_vershuur/g_verschuur.html"TARGET="_top">Gerrit
Verschuur</A>, an astrophysicist affiliated with Rhodes College in Memphis,
Tenn., has recently published a book on the effects of meteorite impacts. Here
are his thoughts:<P>

"I suggested to the FBI a couple months ago that a meteorite could have struck
TWA Flight 800; I also suggested how they might be able to demonstrate that this
had occurred. They did not reply.<P>

"Such an impact is extremely unlikely. The probabilities are very difficult to
estimate. We do know that four or five automobiles have been struck by meteorites
in the last half-dozen years. These events do not always get much notice in the
media. On November 22, 1996, a meteorite struck Honduras, leaving the largest
impact scar (a 165-foot crater) recorded on our planet this century, but the news
did not get out for nearly three weeks. Eventually, the event was reported in
British press. Our local media did not report it at all.<P>

"As for evidence, I would re-interview all eyewitnesses to determine whether the
so-called fireball reported by some observers before the explosion had a
trajectory <A HREF="http://www.newsday.com/jet/cras1119.htm"TARGET="_top">consistent with a
meteorite</A>. Depending on the angle of viewing, and if the object was rushing
along the atmosphere from a distance, then one might get the illusion of
something fired upward. CBS recently aired a news program about TWA Flight 800.
On that program, several people who saw the alleged fireball, including a former
Air Force pilot, were adamant that it was real. Their description sounded just
like what people say when they see a daylight astronomical fireball, or bolide.<P>

"Despite the incredibly small odds, I think the meteoric hypothesis for the
downing of TWA Flight 800 is the best I have heard. Proving it would not be easy,
however. If a small object penetrated the fuselage and gas tank of the airplane,
it would have left two small holes bent inward. That area of the tank and the
fuselage would be blasted apart, however. The small hole might be in the crucial
pieces of metal that have not yet been recovered."<P>

"How do scientists determine the ages of stars? Is the technique really
accurate enough to use it to verify the age of the universe?"</A></B></FONT>

<P>--<I>Carol Phillips<BR>Lubbock, Texas</I>

<P><A HREF="http://www.mckenna.edu/faculty/profiles/snaftilan.htm"TARGET="_top"">Stephen A.
Naftilan</A>, professor of physics in the Joint Science Department of the
Claremont Colleges, responds:

<P>"Astronomers usually cannot tell the age of an individual star. There are certain
stars that we know are very young, and others that are very old, but for most
stars we cannot tell. When we have a large group of stars, however, we can tell
its age. This is possible because all of the stars in a cluster are presumed to
have begun their life at approximately the same time. After a relatively brief
time (in 'star time,' that is--we are talking thousands to millions of years
here) stars reach the adult phase of their life, which we call the main sequence
phase. The length of time a star spends in the main sequence phase depends on its
mass.

<P>"Constructing a plot, called the <A
HREF="http://zebu.uoregon.edu/~imamura/208/jan20/hr.html"TARGET="_top"">HR diagram</A>, of the
stars in the cluster, scientists can determine the mass of the stars that are
just ending this phase and moving on to the next phase of their life, the red
giant phase. Computer models allow us to predict how old a star of that mass must
be to be at that juncture of its life, and hence to estimate the age of the
cluster. Recently, this procedure has come under close scrutiny because that age
it gives for the oldest star clusters in our Milky Way seems to be older than the
age of the universe derived from the most recent <A
HREF="http://www.stsci.edu/EPA/PR/96/21/PR.html"TARGET="_top"">Hubble Space Telescope
data</A>."

<P>Peter B. Stetson, senior research officer at the <A
HREF="http://www.dao.nrc.ca/"TARGET="_top"">Dominion Astrophysical Observatory</A> in Victoria,
British Columbia, provides a more detailed reply:

<P>"It is impossible to determine the age of a single star all by itself. The only
real means we have to determine stellar ages is through the study of <A
HREF="http://www.seds.org/messier/cluster.html"TARGET="_top"">star clusters</A>. In our galaxy,
the Milky Way, there are two basic types of star cluster. Clusters of the first
type are called '<A HREF="http://www.seds.org/messier/glob.html"TARGET="_top"">globular
clusters'</a> because they appear as huge, round globs containing anywhere from a few
thousand to a few million stars. Globular clusters are very old, and they are
scattered around (not just within) the Milky Way; these clusters seem to have
originated near the time our galaxy started to form, when the universe was quite
young. Clusters of the second type used to be called 'galactic clusters' because
we see them inside the body of our galaxy, but now it is more common to refer to
them as '<A HREF="http://www.seds.org/messier/open.html"TARGET="_top"">open clusters</A>'
because they are much looser and their stars more spread out on the sky than are
those in globular clusters. Open clusters can contain anywhere from a few dozen
to a few thousand stars, and they come in a wide range of ages. Apparently our
galaxy started making open clusters soon after it settled down to its present
size and continues making them even today.

<P>"The stars in either type of star cluster were all formed at the same time and
out of the same material. The essential feature of a star cluster that lets us
estimate its age is that each cluster contains stars with a range of masses. When
a cluster is born, it will contain many stars of about the same size and mass as
our sun, but there will also be numerous stars more massive than our sun and many
other stars less massive than our sun. For about 90 percent of its lifetime, a
star shines because nuclear reactions are converting hydrogen to helium in the
star's center, releasing vast amounts of energy. This energy works its way from
the center of the star to the surface and escapes the star in the form of light.
The more massive a star is, the bigger the furnace in the center, and the
brighter and the hotter the star is in this stable stage of its life. The most
massive stars are very bright and blue-hot; a less massive star is somewhat
fainter and white-hot; a star like our sun is a bit fainter still and is
yellow-hot; and the least massive stars are very faint and merely red-hot. During
this period of its life, a star hardly changes either in brightness or in
temperature.

<P>"The duration of the stable, or 'main sequence,' phase depends on a star's mass.
A star 10 times as massive as the sun contains, clearly, 10 times as much fuel.
It consumes that fuel roughly <I>10,000</I> times faster than the sun, however.
As a result, it has a total lifetime 1,000 times shorter than that of our sun.
When the hydrogen fuel in the center of a massive star is exhausted--'the center'
representing about 10 percent of the star's total mass--it becomes increasingly
unstable. The star remains bright, but it quickly switches from being
comparatively small and hot to being huge and red for a while, then it briefly
becomes smaller and bluer, then even larger and even redder, and finally explodes
as a supernova, spewing its nuclear ashes as well as its unburned fuel back into
space. Similarly, a star five times more massive than the sun has a lifetime
roughly 100 times shorter than the sun before it becomes unstable and ends its
active life. A star like our sun is calculated to have a total stable life-span
of around 10 billion years; the sun is now a bit less than half that age (this
age is very accurately determined from radioactive elements in meteorites), so we
have another five billion years or so before we have to start looking for a new
home.

<P>"In the case of a single star, its brightness and temperature don't tell us much.
Because these properties stay fairly constant for 90 percent of its lifetime, the
star could be fairly young or fairly old, and we wouldn't be able to tell the
difference. In a star cluster, we have the advantage that stars of all masses
formed at about the same time. So all we have to do is look at the cluster and
determine how hot and how massive is the hottest, bluest, most massive star that
has not yet entered the late, unstable period of its life. The star's mass tells
us how much fuel the star had when it was born, and the star's brightness tells
us how fast it is burning that fuel. We know that the star is just about to start
becoming unstable--after all, the stars that are more massive have already
started to become unstable. We also know that its fuel is just about exhausted.
The ratio of how much fuel the star had in the beginning to how fast it has been
burning that fuel tells us how long the star has been alive. (By analogy, if we
know how much kerosene our hurricane lamp contained when we lit it and how fast
it consumes the kerosene, and if the lamp is just now starting to go out, then we
can deduce how long it has been lit.) Because all the stars in the cluster are
the same age, the age of that one star tells us the age of the entire cluster.

<P>"The basic physics of how hydrogen is converted to helium in the centers of stars
and the amount of energy generated by this process is comparatively simple and
well understood. For much of the 20th century, the main limitation to our
knowledge of stellar ages has been due to the difficulty of measuring the
distances to the clusters--especially the distances to the oldest clusters, the
globulars, which are comparatively far away. (We know how bright a star looks,
but to know how bright it really is, you have to know how far away it is: is it
like a headlight a mile away or an airport beacon 10 miles away? In the dark of
the nighttime sky with no reference points, it's pretty hard to tell.) Technical
advances, such as the introduction of charge-coupled devices to replace
photographic plates for the measuring of stellar distances and brightnesses, are
making our observations more secure.

<P>"Distance measurements have improved to the point at which other details needed
to determine the ages of star clusters--such as the fine details of how a star
converts nuclear energy to visible light--can no longer be ignored. How exactly
does the energy get from the center of the star, where it is generated, to the
surface, where it becomes the light that we see? How important is convection as a
means of transporting energy, and how efficient is the convection? The answer to
these questions has some effect on the inferred relationship between mass and
surface temperature. Just how much oxygen is in the stars, along with the
hydrogen and helium? The relative amount of oxygen present has a modest effect on
the efficiency of the central furnace, affecting the relation between mass and
brightness and, hence, age.
<P>
"Taken together, the uncertainty in the observations and the uncertainty in the
relevant theoretical physics probably lead to an uncertainty of 10 percent to 20
percent in our estimate of the absolute ages of the globular clusters. According
to our best available estimates, stars having about 90 percent of the sun's mass
are just now starting to die in the <A
HREF="http://www.dao.nrc.ca/DAO/SCIENCE/9614.html"TARGET="_top"">globulars</A>. These stars are
most probably around 15 billion years old, but they could conceivably be as young
as 12 billion years or as old as 18 billion years. It is very unlikely that most
of them could be either younger or older than this range. This estimate is
already accurate enough to place some very interesting limits on the age and life
history of the universe."

"Astronomers have now discovered about 10 planets orbiting other stars. When and
how will these planets receive names? Who gets to name them?"
</A></B></FONT>

<P>--<I>M.Daniel Blair<br>Washington, D.C.</I>

<P>After years of fruitless searching astronomers have been delighted and a little
astounded by the rapid pace of discovery of planets around nearby stars. The
first of these, around the star <A HREF="http://zebu.uoregon.edu/51peg.html"TARGET="_top">51
Pegasi</A>, was found just in October 1995. There is now strong evidence for
planets circling at least eight sunlike stars. ( The exact number depends on how
much faith one puts in some tentative observations and on whether one classifies
certain extremely massive bodies as true planets; the <A
HREF="http://www.obspm.fr/departement/darc/planets/catalog.html"TARGET="_top">Extrasolar
Planets Catalogue</A> maintains a frequently updated list of the various
candidates.) Such swift progress has caught the scientific community off guard,
so there is as yet no standard set of rules for naming the new planets.

<P><A HREF="http://cannon.sfsu.edu/~gmarcy"TARGET="_top">Geoffrey Marcy</A> of San Francisco
State University leads the team that has produced most of the new discoveries. He
provides this insider's view of the current ferment:

<P>"Formal names of astronomical objects and features are set by the International
Astronomical Union (IAU). At the meeting of the IAU General Assembly in Kyoto,
Japan, in August 1997, there will be a convening of the IAU's Naming Commission.
The commission is the body that normally is responsible for assigning names to
new asteroids, craters and so on. At the Kyoto meeting, the IAU will bring up the
issue of naming new planets around other stars.

<P>"The issue of extrasolar planet names has become quite pressing. For example,
William D. Cochran of the University of Texas and our group at San Francisco
State recently <A HREF="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/9611230"TARGET="_top">announced the
discovery</A> of a planet orbiting the star 16 Cygni B (a sunlike star roughly 70
light-years distant in the constellation Cygnus). What should we call this
planet? We cannot call it ' 16 Cyg B b.' And we certainly cannot call it '16 Cyg
A,' because 16 Cyg B already has a stellar companion by that name. We cannot call
it 16 Cyg C ( which would seem to denote a third star in the system); even '16
Cyg 3' or '16 Cyg B 2' seems too cumbersome and nondescript. So some uniform
naming system is needed.

<P>"Assigning Greek names, akin to the ones we use for the planets of our own solar
system, would be fine, but it would not constitute a coherent naming system per
se. Likewise we could designate the planets using lowercase Roman numerals after
the name of the star, but that system is also very bland and does not work well
verbally. In retrospect, simply using numbers to denote planets might be
adequate--'16 Cyg B 2,' as suggested above, might be okay. But, of course, the
first planet discovered around a star might not be the closest one nor the
biggest one. Perhaps we could number the planets as they are found; then
centuries from now, when the planetary inventories are more complete, someone
could rename them all, just as Scarlatti's sonatas were renumbered years later,
putting them in correct order."

</A></B></FONT>

<P>--<I>Jack Ryan,<BR> El Dorado, Arkansas</I>

<P>Ever since the discovery of <A
HREF="http://bang.lanl.gov/solarsys/pluto.htm">Pluto</A> in
1930, astronomers have recognized it as an oddball, very unlike
the other outer planets. The quote from Luu and Jewitt refers to
the recent discovery of a population of giant, comet-like objects
orbiting beyond Neptune, a zone called the <A
HREF="http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/ faculty/jewitt/kb.html">Kuiper
belt</A>. Pluto lies in the vicinity of this belt, leading some
astronomers to consider it the largest member of the population
of small bodies at the fringe of the solar system. But does that
mean it is not really a planet? It is a subjective question, one
that has produced some passionate disagreements within the
astronomical community.

<P><A HREF="http://bu-ast.bu.edu/~layoung/">Leslie Young</A>, a
research associate at the Boston University Center for Space
Physics, offers her view:

<P>"Should Pluto keep its planet status if it is 'merely' the
largest Kuiper belt object? In this case, size does matter.
Pluto is large enough to be spherical from self-gravity and
probably to have an inner, dense core. It has a thin atmosphere
and probably has weather and complex seasons. Although Pluto may
be dynamically similar to its smaller cousins in the outer solar
system, it is geologically and meteorologically very distinct.

<P>"There is no cut-and-dried definition of a planet. Airless
Mercury is considered a planet, but Saturn's giant moon, Titan,
which is larger than Mercury and has an atmosphere that is
thicker than Earth's, is not. Moonless Venus is considered a
planet, but the asteroid <A HREF="http://
seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/ida.html">Ida</A>,
which possesses a small moon named Dactyl, is not. It is simpler
and more straightforward to define what is not a planet.
Something is not a planet if it is a satellite of another planet
or if it is a small, irregularly shaped object (for example, an
asteroid or a comet). Based on these criteria, Pluto remains a
planet."

<P>Daniel W. E. Green of the <A
HREF="http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/">Harvard- Smithsonian Center
for Astrophysics</A> in Cambridge, Mass., provides a more
thorough interpretation of the debate:

<P>"Anything in the solar system that is larger than a few meters
in size and that is not producing stellar quantities of heat and
light is properly considered a planet of some sort (major
planet, minor planet, small planet, tiny planet), unless it
orbits another body besides the sun--in which case it is usually
called a satellite of the larger body. Though not usually called
planets, even comets could be thought of as small, icy planets.
For this reason, Pluto is surely a planet.

<P>"There are different kinds of planets in the solar system, and
we perhaps cannot adequately classify all of them, because we do
not have enough information. A large group of planets 1,000
kilometers across and smaller orbit the sun in a large belt
between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter; these small planets are
usually referred to as asteroids or minor planets. Most
asteroids have orbits that keep them always between Mars and
Jupiter ( that is, their orbits are not terribly elongated).
Many of them, however, have orbits that take them across the
orbits of major planets, including that of Earth. Comets (which
are distinguished from asteroids by the fuzzy coma and tail they
develop when they draw close to the sun) are well known to have
extremely elongated, or highly elliptical, orbits. Some comets,
such as <A
HREF="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/halley.html">Halley's
comet</A>, have orbits that cross the orbits
of many of the eight major planets.

<P>"Eight major planets, you might ask? Well, in reality, it has
come time to stop talking generally about the number of planets
in the solar system, because such figures can be misleading and
confusing to students and to the general public. It is probably
better to say simply that the solar system is a system of
objects that is dominated by a star (the sun), around which are
found many orbiting bodies of sizes ranging from particles of
dust and gas to the giant gaseous planet Jupiter. There are four
notable large gaseous planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and
Neptune), and inside the main asteroid belt are some smaller,
rocky bodies (the most sizable of which are Mercury, Venus,
Earth and Mars). Orbiting the large gaseous planets are dozens
of satellites, seven of which, along with our own moon, are
larger than Pluto.

<P>"Aside from the large gaseous planets, there are a few smaller
planets that have satellites of their own (including Earth,
Mars, one or two asteroids and Pluto). Between the sun and the
orbit of Neptune (the outermost major planet) lie many small
planets and planetesimals having both stable and unstable
orbits. Those in unstable orbits may cross the orbits of the gas
giant planets, Mars or the Earth. A few such objects even go
closer to the sun than Venus or Mercury. Most of these
sun-grazing objects are <A
HREF="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/
comets.html">comets or <A
HREF="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/
nineplanets/meteorites.html">meteoroids</A>--tiny objects of the
kind that frequently collide with Earth's atmosphere and become
visible as meteors or 'shooting stars.'

<P>"In the 20th century, astronomers have found several dozen
objects in the solar system whose orbits lie mostly beyond the
orbit of Neptune. Among these <A
HREF="http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/faculty/jewitt/kb-tab.html">
trans-Neptunian objects</A>, all but Pluto have been found since
1992. There appear to be two classes of such objects,
distinguished by <A
HREF="http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/%7Ejchen/kbo.html">their
orbits</A>. ' Kuiper belt' objects lie in a belt around 35 to 40
astronomical units from the sun (where one unit equals the
average distance between Earth and the sun); members of the
second group have orbits similar to that of Pluto, orbiting the
sun in 2:3 resonance with Neptune (meaning that for every three
orbits Neptune makes about the sun, the Pluto-like objects orbit
twice). We are unsure of the relative abundance of Kuiper belt
objects compared with <A
HREF="http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/faculty/jewitt/plutino.html">'2:3 Neptune
resonance' objects</A>, but from the known
sample, the Kuiper belt objects appear to be twice as common.

<P>"It is only since 1978 that we have known the real size and
approximate mass of Pluto; both of these are far smaller than
astronomers had thought soon after Pluto's discovery in 1930.
For numerous reasons, Pluto was called the 'ninth planet' at the
time; with little information to support or refute that
assertion, this classification became locked in astronomy
textbooks for decades. But all along, Pluto appeared different
from the eight known larger planets: for instance, its orbit is
much more elliptical and more highly inclined with respect to
the ecliptic than are the orbits of the larger planets, and its
orbit brings it inside that of Neptune, so that Neptune is
currently the outermost major planet. Pluto is so small that
calling it a 'major planet' is misleading in the context of what
we now know about the solar system. It is more accurately
described as a 'planetesimal' or a 'minor planet.' Pluto may
well be related to the Kuiper belt objects. There is much
evidence these objects are related to comets, so Pluto may in
effect be a giant comet. But much more work and observation is
needed before drawing clear conclusions.

<P>"To answer the question, then, there is nothing to define a
'true planet.' Pluto is a planet of some sort, perhaps akin to
the comets or to some of the icy moons orbiting the gas giant
planets, but it is surely not a major planet in the sense that,
say, Venus or Jupiter is. Contrary to some ill- informed recent
stories in the news media, the question is not whether or not
Pluto is a planet, but rather whether or not it is a major
planet. The answer to this latter question is a definite no! We
do know that Pluto is a most interesting object, and it
highlights the fact that the minor bodies of the solar system
are just as important as the major ones in understanding the
past, present and future nature of the solar system."

<P><A HREF="http://albert.astro.williams.edu/jpasachoff/" TARGET="_top">Jay M.
Pasachoff</A> is Field Memorial Professor of Astronomy at
Williams College in Massachusetts. He answers:

<P>"When a space probe is accelerated via gravitational slingshot,
it actually steals some energy from the planet. The total energy
is conserved, of course.

<P>"To understand how this effect works, imagine bouncing a ball
off the front of a locomotive. If the locomotive is stopped,
when you throw the ball at the cowcatcher at five miles per
hour, it comes back at five miles per hour. Now imagine the
locomotive is moving toward you at 30 miles per hour. From the
frame of reference of the cowcatcher, the ball comes toward it
at 30 + 5 = 35 miles per hour, and so it rebounds off at 35
miles per hour. It therefore returns toward you at the 35 miles
per hour with respect to the cowcatcher plus the 30 miles per
hour at which the cowcatcher is coming at you. Hence, it picks
up twice the speed of the train.

<P>"A gravitational interaction with Jupiter is just like bouncing
off it. Just as in the above example, energy from Jupiter is
transferred to the spaceship. For more information on questions
such as this one, see my book <I>Astronomy: From the Earth to
the Universe</I>"

<P><A HREF="http://www.cris.com/~Geoquery/greg.html" TARGET="_top">T. Gregory
Guzik</A>, associate professor of physics and astronomy at
Louisiana State University, explains it as follows:

<P>"A spacecraft's velocity relative to the planet giving it a
gravity assist is the same when it leaves the planet as it was
when approaching. But the spacecraft's velocity relative to the
sun increases or decreases, depending on the direction from
which the craft comes. This change occurs because the spacecraft
becomes caught up briefly in the planet's gravitational field
and gains or loses velocity through mutual gravitational
attraction. To increase its velocity, a spacecraft must approach
the planet from behind; for deceleration, the spacecraft must
approach the planet from the front (that is, from the direction
in which the planet is traveling around the sun).

<P>"Because the planet is moving, it actually transfers some of its
angular momentum to the spacecraft. What the spacecraft gains in
velocity, the planet loses. The mass of the planet is so great
as compared with that of the spacecraft, however, that the loss
is imperceptible.

<P>"An imperfect analogy would be shooting a marble at a bowling
ball that is moving slowly toward you. The marble would bounce
off the bowling ball at a greater speed than it struck it, and
the bowling ball would slow down by some minute amount."

<P>And, finally, an explanation with an extra twist from <A
HREF="http://www.engineering.usu.edu/Departments/mae/Faculty/redd.html"
TARGET="_top">Frank
J. Redd</A>, a professor of mechanical and aerospace
engineering at Utah State University in Logan, Utah:

<P>To understand the 'slingshot' effect, one must understand the
concept of relative velocity. As a probe approaches a planet,
its velocity with respect to the sun is equal to the vector sum
of its velocity with respect to the planet and the velocity of
the planet with respect to the sun. It is true that the
magnitudes of the approach and departure velocities with respect
to the planet are equal, but the direction of the departure
velocity is changed by the gravitational attraction of the
planet. In effect, the trajectory is bent.

<P>"As the probe leaves the planet, its velocity with respect to
the sun has changed because the vector sum of its velocity with
respect to the planet and the planet's velocity has changed.
Because energy is a function of velocity squared, the energy in
the sun-centered orbit has increased or decreased depending on
the approach trajectory."

<P><A HREF="http://albert.astro.williams.edu/jpasachoff/" TARGET="_top">Jay M.
Pasachoff</A> is Field Memorial Professor of Astronomy at Williams College
in Massachusetts. He sent this answer:

<P>"Trigonometric parallax--the tiny, apparent back-and-forth shifts of
nearby stars caused by our changing perspective as the earth orbits the
sun--can indeed be used to measure distances only to comparatively nearby
stars. Some of the best data on stellar positions in the sky come from <A
HREF="http://astro.estec.esa.nl/SA-general/Projects/Hipparcos/hipparcos.html"
TARGET="_top"><I>Hipparcos</I></A>,
a spacecraft launched in 1989 by the European Space Agency.
<I>Hipparcos</I> has measured the trigonometric parallaxes of about 10,000
stars to an accuracy of better than 10 percent, out to a distance of about
300 light-years. But our galaxy is about 100,000 light-years across, so
parallax measurements become useless long before we approach the distances
to other galaxies.

<P>"The traditional way to measure distances to nearby galaxies is by
studying variable stars, especially a type of bright variable star known
as a <A
HREF="http://pegasus.phast.umass.edu/a100/handouts/cepheid.html"
TARGET="_top">Cepheid
variable</A>. Early in this century <A
HREF="http://www.sjsu.edu/depts/Museum/lea.html" TARGET="_top">Henrietta Swan
Leavitt</A> discovered that the longer the period of variation of a
Cepheid variable, the greater its luminosity. Another American astronomer,
<A
HREF="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/htmltest/gifcity/shapley_obit.html"
TARGET="_top">Harlow
Shapley</A>, then was able to correlate the brightnesses of Cepheids with
those of known types of ordinary stars, tying Leavitt's relative distance
scale to an absolute one. Thus, we can observe a Cepheid, note how long it
takes for its brightness to vary and plot that information on an already
established graph to find out its intrinsic luminosity. Comparing this
true brightness (its 'absolute magnitude') with its apparent brightness as
seen in the sky (its 'apparent magnitude') allows us to calculate how far
away it is, using the inverse-square law of brightness.
        
"Fortunately, Cepheids are luminous enough that they can be observed in
other galaxies, not just in our own. In the 1920s <A
HREF="http://pao.gsfc.nasa.gov/gsfc/weekly/96-6.htm" TARGET="_top">Edwin
Hubble</A> used
the period-luminosity relation for variable stars to establish the
distances to various galaxies and proved that they lie far outside our
Milky Way. In the course of that work, he discovered what we now call
'Hubble's law,' that galaxies display a linear relation between distance
and redshift (the redshift is the shift in the positions of lines in the
galaxies' spectra toward the red end of the rainbow). Hubble's law is the
basis for the modern understanding that we live in an expanding universe.
After measuring the redshift, which we can do by passing a galaxy's light
through a spectrogram, we can deduce the distance using Hubble's law. This
technique is the astronomer's basic tool for finding the distances to the
farthest things in the universe.

<P>"But of course there are many complications. Maybe the relation between
redshift and distance is not quite linear when we get very far out in the
universe. Maybe there are giant concentrations of mass that distort what
is otherwise thought to be a smooth, outward expansion, or 'Hubble flow.'
Maybe the expansion of the universe inferred by Hubble is accelerated by a
'cosmological constant' in Einstein's equations, the solutions of which
are the basis for theoretical cosmology. And measurements of the rate of
the cosmic expansion remain controversial. The <I>Hubble Space
Telescope</I> is in the process of observing a large set of Cepheid
variables in distant galaxies in order to resolve this question.

<P>"Cosmologists are also turning their attention to other bright objects
that can be seen at great distances as a way of verifying the accuracy of
their measurements. A certain kind of exploding star, or <A
HREF="http://praxis.pha.jhu.edu/astro2/astro2_science/swmid1.html"
TARGET="_top">supernova</A>
(called a Type Ia supernova), always seems to have the same peak
luminosity, so these supernovae can be used as 'standard candles' instead
of Cepheids. Supernovae are billions of times brighter than Cepheids; as a
result, they can be observed at far greater distances. A number of
researchers are trying to exploit this advantage and get <A
HREF="http://www.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Archive/supernovas-distant.html"
TARGET="_top">more
accurate information</A> about the size and age of the universe. The
<I>Hubble Space Telescope</I> is assisting in this work as well.

<P>"Astronomers are making tremendous progress in establishing the distance
scale of the universe. For the present, however, we often are happy to use
the relative distance scale, simply giving the observed redshift of a
galaxy or quasar and allowing efforts to translate redshifts into absolute
distances in light-years (or kilometers, or whatever) to be part of a
controversy that is fun to watch."

"Why are scientists so sure that the Martian meteorite that has been in the
news recently really came from Mars? Couldn't it have been dislodged from
Earth by an asteroid impact and then returned millions of years later?
Couldn't the early Earth (or some distant asteroid) once have been
chemically similar to Mars?</A>"</B></FONT>

<P>-<I>Pete Stafford<BR> Atlanta, Ga.</I>

<P>Several readers have asked versions of this question. David W. Mittlefehldt
of the NASA Johnson Space Center considers the second part of the question,
why astronomers are so sure that the "Martian" meteorite did not really
originate on Earth:

<P>"There are numerous reasons why ALH 84001, the meteorite that contains
possible fossil evidence of early Mars life, cannot be a fragment of Earth
that was blasted into space and reaccreted after a sojourn of about 16
million years in space.

<P>"Perhaps the most conclusive evidence lies in the mix of oxygen isotopes
(versions of the same element having different atomic masses). All oxygen is
composed of three naturally occurring isotopes of masses of 16, 17 and 18.
Chemical processes that occur on planets and in space can partially
separate, or fractionate, the different isotopes, and the amount of
fractionation varies directly with the difference in mass. That is, the
amount of fractionation of oxygen 18 from oxygen 16 is twice the
fractionation of oxygen 17 from oxygen 16. All oxygen on Earth follows the
same fractionation pattern, be it in a rock, a snowflake, the air we breathe
or the nail clippings from your big toe. 

<P>When one measures the isotopic
composition of meteorites, however, it turns out that most meteorite groups
do not lie on this terrestrial fractionation line; they have either excesses
or depletions in oxygen 16 as compared with Earth rocks with the same oxygen
18 content. There is no chemical process that can explain this difference,
so the meteorites must have formed from material that had an oxygen isotopic
composition distinct from that of the material that went into making Earth.
The meteorites from Mars, including ALH 84001, are different from all Earth
materials in oxygen isotopic composition and so cannot have come from Earth.

<P>"There are other reasons to discount Earth as the parent of ALH 84001.
Isotope ratio measurements show that the nitrogen in ALH 84001 is very
'heavy': it contains much more of the mass 15 isotope relative to the mass
14 isotope than does our atmosphere. Similarly, hydrogen in ALH 84001 is
much 'heavier' (enriched in deuterium) than hydrogen found in terrestrial rocks.
So-called noble (unreactive) gases trapped in meteorites are thought to be
atmospheric gases that were trapped in the meteorite by the impact process
that launched them off their parent body. The heavy noble gases,
particularly xenon, trapped in ALH 84001 are distinct in isotopic
composition from xenon in Earth's atmosphere but are similar to that in the
Martian atmosphere. ALH 84001 contains carbonate minerals; the carbon in the
carbonates is also enriched in the heavy isotope compared to that in terrestrial
carbonates. Hence, the composition of ALH 84001 is distinctly
nonterrestrial.

<P>"Finally, there are some purely geologic reasons why ALH 84001 cannot be
from Earth. The crystallization age of ALH 84001, though not precisely
known, is about 4.5 billion years. This is much older than that of any known
Earth rock (the oldest known are on the order of 3.9 billion years old).
While in space, rocks are exposed to cosmic rays, high-energy particles. The
cosmic-ray exposure age of ALH 84001 is about 16 million years, which means
that it was launched off the surface of its parent object 16 million years
ago. It would take a huge impact, which would produce a large crater, to
launch a rock off Earth. No craters of sufficient size of that age are known
on Earth. (ALH 84001 cannot have come from the ocean floor, where a crater
might have gone undetected, because nowhere is the oceanic crust older than
about 200 to 250 million years.)

<P>"Although there are few things in science that can be said with absolute,
100 percent certainty, this is one of them. ALH 84001 is not an Earth rock."

<P><A HREF="http://www-chem.stanford.edu/faculty/zare/">Richard N. Zare</A> of
Stanford University, one of the co-authors of the paper describing possible
fossil life in the Martian meteorite, introduces the next part of the story:
how scientists came to think that the rock came specifically from Mars:

<P>"When I was a graduate student, the conventional wisdom was that meteorites
derived only from asteroids, not from the moon or other planets. We did not
consider the possibility that the impact of a large body--an asteroid or a
comet--could blast chunks of rock free from a planet into orbits around the
sun, where they could one day land on Earth. In 1981, however, scientists
determined that a meteorite found in Antarctica must have originated on the
moon: its composition exactly matched that of the lunar samples brought back
by the Apollo astronauts. So much for what I had been taught!

<P>"Only a few years later, another Antarctic meteorite was found to be from
Mars. This conclusion was based on the close match between the
concentrations of various gases trapped inside the meteorite and the
concentrations of those gases in the Martian atmosphere, as measured by the
two <I>Viking</I> lander missions to Mars in 1976. The evidence was strong
enough that researchers studying meteorites quickly became convinced, by and
large, that we had in our possession a meteorite from Mars. Since then,
about dozen other such Martian meteorites have been identified."

<P><A
HREF="http://locutus.gg.utk.edu/UTK_Geology/depart_newsletter/mcsween.htm">Harry
Y. McSween</A> of the University of Tennessee expands on this story:

<P>"The Martian meteorite belongs to a class known as the SNC
(shergottite-nakhlite-chassignite) meteorites. The first hint that these
objects are fragments not of asteroids but of a large planet came from the
determination that all but one of them formed relatively recently by solar
system standards. These meteorites are igneous rocks; measurement of radioactive
isotopes in them gives the times at which the magmas solidified. Their ages
(1.3 billion years or younger) are too young for igneous activity on small
bodies like asteroids, because such bodies cannot long retain the heat
generated by slow decay of radionuclides. Large planets can retain this
heat, however, because rocks are poor conductors of heat, and heat loss
through great thicknesses of rock would require many billions of years. Of
course, this line of argument only indicates that the SNC meteorites came
from a large body (that is, a planet), although Mars seemed a plausible
choice. 

<P>"A more direct link between SNC meteorites and Mars is based on the gases
implanted in the meteorites. The shergottite rocks in particular were
heavily shocked by meteor impacts when they were on their parent planet, and
some of them contain pockets and veins of solidified impact melt (glass).
Bubbles trapped in the glass provide tiny samples of the ambient atmosphere;
analysis of the gases in the bubbles reveals that they rather precisely
match the composition of the Martian atmosphere as measured by <I>Viking</I>
landers. This atmospheric composition is very unusual, so it serves as a
chemical fingerprint to tie these meteorites uniquely to Mars. 

<P>"Not all of the SNC meteorites are sufficiently shocked to contain trapped
Martian atmosphere, but all share other chemical characteristics (such as
their oxygen isotope compositions) that link them together as specimens from
the same planet. The ALH 84001 meteorite, the one in which the possible
signs of fossil life have been found, is much older than the other SNC
samples, but it shares with them these other chemical characteristics."

<P>And Michael E. Lipschutz, professor of chemistry and director of chemistry
operations at the <A
HREF="http://primelab.physics.purdue.edu/primelab_home.html">PRIME Lab</A>
at Purdue University, provides this detailed overview: 

<P>"There are 12 known Martian meteorites, six of which fell elsewhere on Earth
before 1969, when the first major meteorite recoveries began from
Antarctica. (One of the six is the only one known to have caused a fatality:
a piece hit and killed a dog when it landed in Egypt in 1911!) Most Martian
meteorites have comparatively young crystallization ages of 1.3 billion
years or less. The crystallization age of a meteorite is the time elapsed
since its constituent solid materials crystallized from molten silicate
magma. Such young crystallization ages imply a large parent planet, because
only large objects can develop and retain for several billion years the high
temperatures necessary to form magmas. Asteroids would have cooled down very
shortly (less than 100 million years) after the solar system formed 4.55
billion ago, so such objects could not have produced the Martian meteorites.
(Interestingly, ALH 84001 has an old crystallization age of 4.5 billion
years, much older than the other Martian meteorites.)

<P>"To escape from a planet, a rock must be propelled outward by a fast-moving,
large projectile (of asteroidal or cometary origin) whose impact results in
an explosion. The velocity of material that is ejected by the explosion
depends on the pressure to which the material is shocked: the higher the
pressure, the higher the shock velocity. But the shock temperature also
increases with shock pressure. The maximum velocity that silicate material
can acquire by shock, yet remain unvaporized, is about five kilometers per
second--which happens to be approximately Martian escape velocity (or the
speed required for an object to go from Mars's surface to infinite
distance). Earth's escape velocity, in contrast, is 11 kilometers per
second, so it is essentially impossible to shock silicate strongly enough to
free it from Earth without vaporizing it at the same time.

<P>"Although people began to think years ago that the SNC meteorites came from
Mars, there was one critical question unanswered: Why weren't there known
lunar meteorites? The moon is closer to Earth than Mars is, after all, and
the escape velocity of the moon is just 2.4 kilometers per second. That
question disappeared in 1981 and 1982, when the first of a dozen lunar
meteorites was discovered in Antarctica.

<P>"The 12 Martian meteorites are genetically linked to one another by the
isotopic composition of oxygen in their minerals. The relative amounts of
stable oxygen 16, oxygen 17 and oxygen 18 in planetary samples apparently
reflect the amounts present in that part of the presolar nebula (the cloud
of  gas and dust) from which their solid parental material condensed. On an
appropriate oxygen isotope plot, terrestrial and lunar rocks define one
trend line, Martian meteorites another, and other meteorite types still
others.

<P>"The chemical compositions of Martian meteorites seem generally similar to
the compositions of Martian rocks determined by the two <I>Viking</I>
landers in 1976. The <I>Viking</I> results have large uncertainties,
however. The compositional evidence that I find most convincing relates to
the elemental and isotopic contents of the Martian atmosphere measured by
<I>Viking</I>.
The corresponding contents in Earth's atmosphere are known much more
precisely. Samples of shock-produced glass in one of the Antarctic Martian
meteorites contain gases whose elemental and isotopic compositions seem to
represent a mixture of terrestrial and Martian atmospheres. It is thought
that Martian atmospheric gases were trapped in the glass when it formed from
silicates by shock during an impact on the Martian surface. After the
meteorite landed on Earth, some terrestrial atmospheric gas leaked in.

<P>"I think that every experienced planetary scientist today accepts the
Martian origin of these 12 meteorites. They are currently being studied
intensively to obtain information about Mars; only when we have planetary
samples in our laboratories can we study them with the sophisticated
equipment and techniques necessary to answer fundamental questions about
their genesis and history. Whether they contain evidence for alien life is
an excellent example of such a question."

<P>James R. Graham, professor of astronomy at the <A
HREF="http://astro.berkeley.edu/home.html">University of California,
Berkeley</A>, responds:

<P>"Interesting question! There are similarities between the two, but don't be
deceived--terrestrial clouds are very different from interstellar clouds.

<P>"Interstellar clouds are composed mostly of hydrogen, whereas terrestrial
clouds are formed from water droplets or ice crystals. Terrestrial clouds
come in diverse forms. Take common <A
HREF="http://covis1.atmos.uiuc.edu/guide/clouds/convective.clouds/html/fair.cumulus.html">cumulus
clouds</A> as an example. These are the fluffy, white, dome-shaped clouds
that have flat bases and wispy tops. A video of the sky played fast-forward
shows that cumulus clouds are not static, well-defined entities but rather
that they are continually forming, changing shape and dissipating. This
restless process occurs because cumulus clouds are created by <A
HREF="http://covis1.atmos.uiuc.edu/guide/clouds/cloud.lifting/html/convective.lifting.html">convective
motions</A> of moist air driven by heat from the sun-warmed earth. As a cell
of warm air rises, the surrounding atmospheric pressure decreases, allowing
it to expand. Expansion causes the air to cool adiabatically (that is,
without exchanging heat with the surrounding air) until its temperature
declines below the dew point; the air then becomes supersaturated with water
vapor. The excess vapor condenses, forming water droplets or, if it is cold
enough, ice crystals. Condensation releases latent heat, so the cycle of
condensation and convection continues upward until the cell's energy is
exhausted. The cell then begins to fall, to be replaced by a new, warm
rising cell.

<P>"Water vapor is transparent but water droplets or ice crystals scatter
sunlight, making the cloud visible. Therefore, what defines a cloud is not a
specific volume of atmosphere, but rather the boundary where a phase
transition occurs between vapor and liquid water. This 'dew point' depends
on temperature and pressure, which are in turn determined by the motion of
the convective cell. Anyone who has watched convection in a vigorously
boiling pot of water can readily appreciate the turbulent motions that
characterize the process. It is this complexity which leads to the
fascinating shapes of cumulus clouds.

<P>"A wide variety of different types of interstellar nebulae and clouds exist.
Probably the most familiar are those found in regions of star formation,
where the gas is lit up by young stars which recently formed out of that
gas. Spectacular examples include the <A
HREF="http://www.seds.org/billa/twn/n1976.html">Orion Nebula</A> and <A
HREF="http://www.stsci.edu/pubinfo/PR/95/44.html">Eagle Nebula</A> (the
latter was recently the target of a widely seen image taken by the <A
HREF="http://www.stsci.edu/top.html"><I>Hubble Space Telescope</I></A>). A
kind of phase transition also determines the visible edges of interstellar
clouds. 

<P>"In regions of star formation, youthful stars inject radiative energy into
interstellar clouds, which are primarily composed of hydrogen molecules and
hydrogen atoms. Gas close to these stars is illuminated by the young stars'
ultraviolet emissions. Ultraviolet rays are sufficiently energetic that they
can remove electrons from hydrogen atoms; the resulting zone of ionized
hydrogen is called an H II region. The ionized gas in an H II region
fluoresces like a neon sign. If the interstellar medium were uniform, then
each young star would light up a spherical region of space, but such is not
the case. Just as sunlight heating the surface of the earth sets the
atmosphere into motion, star formation stirs up the interstellar gas. The
ultraviolet light from stars is an important source of heat, and young stars
often have outflowing winds or jets of material. When massive stars exhaust
their supply of nuclear fuel, they explode as supernovae, releasing titanic
amounts of energy. These complex and dynamic phenomena determine the
temperature and pressure of gas between stars, and hence the shapes of
interstellar clouds.

<P>"The interstellar medium is probably in turbulent motion, just like the
terrestrial atmosphere, but the conditions in the interstellar medium are
very different from those in the earth's atmosphere. For example,
interstellar gas motions are often so violent that velocities exceed the
speed of sound, resulting in extreme compression. Consequently, the
signatures of turbulence may be very different in these two disparate
environments. We can speculate, however, that despite the great differences
between nebulae and terrestrial clouds, there are common themes (such as
fractal or self-similar geometry) present in the complex behaviors--such as
turbulence that occur within these objects. If this inference is correct, it
would help account for the broadly similar appearance of terrestrial and
interstellar clouds."

<P><A HREF="http://prometheus.arc.nasa.gov/division/people/morrison_d.html">David
Morrison</A> of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Ames
Research Center, replies:

<P>"The effects of an impact on the earth depends critically on the size, and
hence the energy, of the impact. For example, a comet less than 100 meters
across will explode high in the atmosphere and probably do no harm
whatsoever. If the comet is 10 kilometers across or larger (that is, if the
impact carries an energy of more than about 100 million megatons), the
resulting global environmental damage will be so extensive that it will lead
to a mass extinction, in which most life forms die. This is what happened 65
million years ago at the end of the Cretaceous era, when the dinosaurs went
extinct. The environmental consequences of a giant impact take many forms;
the worst effects come from a global firestorm ignited by backfalling impact
debris, and from a global pall of darkness that lasts for many months due to
dust suspended in the stratosphere."

<P><A
HREF="http://tutlab2.physics.rhodes.edu/faculty_homepages/g_vershuur/g_verschuur
.html">Gerrit L. Verschuur</A>, an astrophysicist and radio astronomer at Rhodes
College
in Memphis, Tenn., has been investigating this topic. He fills in more of
the disconcerting details:

<P>"A collision between a comet and the earth would be a calamitous event.
Based on the best available computer simulations, the impact of an object a
kilometer or more in size would probably trigger the end of civilization.
Such a body might not wipe out our species, but if the incoming object were
more than about five kilometers across, it is very unlikely that Homo
sapiens would survive.

<P>"Broadly speaking, the initial impact creates a vast fireball that kills
anyone who can see it. In the aftermath, ejecta (material hurled into the
air) from the impact blasts into space and showers a large area--half of the
world, perhaps--with flaming debris. (Something like this was seen when
Comet <A HREF="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/sl9/sl9.html">Shoemaker-Levy
9</A> collided with Jupiter in 1994.) The sky becomes filled with gazillions
of meteors, a shower of particles that burn up in the atmosphere on their
way down. It is as if the sky itself has caught fire. The heat unleashed by
this rain of incandescent debris ignites forests and cities, burning them to
embers.

<P>"Then dust from the impact and smoke from the fires girdles the earth,
plunging our planet into a so-called impact winter. (Again, a similar effect
was seen on Jupiter, where huge black bruises appeared after each fragment
of Shoemaker-Levy struck.) Sunlight completely disappears for a month or so
after a collision with a one-kilometer object; a 10-kilometer object might
block out the sun for a year or more. Temperatures drop, and there is no
light for photosynthesis. Plants die, animals die. Animals that happen to
live underground, where roots and other food sources are not destroyed, have
a relatively good chance of survival.

<P>"During the impact, the comet is blown to smithereens. It unleashes billions
of tons of sulfur-laden dust, some of it from the comet itself, some of it
from sulfur-rich rocks that may lie beneath the impact point. The heat of
the impact also creates nitrogen oxides. The sulfurous stuff and nitrogen
oxides make a corrosive acid rain that strips bare any surviving vegetation.
The acid rain runs into the oceans and kills marine organisms, especially
along the continental shelves.

<P>"Nitrogen oxides and debris tossed into the stratosphere by the initial
blast would destroy the ozone layer within days. The impact and subsequent
fires also release a tremendous amount of carbon dioxide into the
atmosphere. After the initial impact winter is all over, there is so much
carbon dioxide in the air that a centuries-long greenhouse effect may
result.

<P>"Scientists are still divided on whether the object that struck the earth 65
million years ago was a comet or an asteroid; further drilling in the
presumed impact region in the Yucatan will help settle the question. Either
way, the consequences were so dire that it is a wonder that any species
survived at all. But some did. After the dust settled, they emerged to
spread over the newly shaped world and multiplied and found new niches in
which to fulfill their destinies.

<P>"More details are to be found in my book 'Impact: The Threat of Comets and
Asteroids,' which will be published by Oxford University Press in September
1996."

"Why do the moon and the sun look so much larger
near the horizon than they do high up in the sky? I have heard this called the
"moon illusion" or the "Problem of Luna Mendex." Is it an illusion of the eye?
</A></B></FONT>

<P>-<I>Merete Ellingsen<BR> Oslo, Norway</I>

<P><A HREF="http://volen.brandeis.edu/cogsci/hershensen.html">Maurice
Hershenson</A>, professor of psychology at Brandeis University, replies as
follows:

<P>"The 'moon illusion' is one of the oldest known psychological phenomena;
records of it go back to ancient China and Egypt. It may be the most ancient
scientific puzzle that is still unexplained.

<P>"There are many misconceptions surrounding the moon illusion. People trained
in the physical sciences often think that the illusion is real, that the moon
actually looks large when it is near the horizon because of refraction of light
by the atmosphere. In fact, there is a very small refractive effect, but it is
not  the cause of the illusion.

<P>"There are a couple ways you can prove to yourself that the light reaching the
eye from the moon remains the same as the moon changes position in the sky. For
instance, if you photograph the moon at various heights above the horizon, you
will see that the images of the moon are all the same size. My students
frequently send me photos of a 'giant' harvest moon in which the moon looks like
a small spot in the sky. (The same thing happens in photos of seemingly
spectacular sunsets--the illusion works for the sun as well.) Another way to
break the hold of the illusion is to cup your hand into a fist and look through
it at the 'large' horizon moon. It will immediately shrink in size.

<P>"Clearly, this is a psychological effect. There are many different theories
(perhaps 10) for why it happens, taken from fields ranging from cognitive
psychology to neurophysiology.

<P>"My own view is that the moon illusion is linked to the mechanism that
produces everyday size-distance perception, a genetically determined brain
process that allows us to translate the planar images that fall on the retina
into a view of rigid objects moving in space. I believe the moon illusion results
from what happens when the mechanism operates in an unusual situation. In normal
perception, when rigid objects move in depth (distance), the angular size of the
light image stimulating our eyes grows or shrinks. The brain automatically
translates this changing stimulation back into the perception of rigid objects
whose position in depth is changing.

<P>"When the moon is near the horizon, the ground and horizon make the moon
appear relatively close. Because the moon is changing its apparent position in
depth while the light stimulus remains constant, the brain's size-distance
mechanism changes its perceived size and makes the moon appear very large.

<P>"The history of the moon illusion and the details of alternative explanations
can be found in my book: The Moon Illusion, by Maurice Hershenson (Lawrence
Erlbaum Associates, Hillsdale, N.J., 1989)."

"Astronomers have reported an apparent shortage of
neutrinos coming from the sun. Does that mean that nuclear fusion is shutting
down inside the sun? Are we then headed for an ice age?</A></B></FONT>

<P>-<I>Thomas Dooling<BR>Norfolk, Va.</I>

<P><A HREF="http://www.phys.hawaii.edu:80/~jgl/">John G. Learned</A>, professor
of physics in the department of physics and astronomy at the University of
Hawaii, relays this answer:

<P>"The nuclear reactions that power the sun produce neutrinos, uncharged
subatomic particles that fly freely from the center of the sun to Earth and
beyond. Four experiments have indicated that the flux of neutrinos coming from
the sun is less than predicted by calculations based on the standard model of
solar physics. A debate has raged now for more than 20 years as to the cause of
this apparent neutrino deficit. Is it a flaw in the experiments? Is it a problem
with the <A HREF="http://zebu.uoregon.edu/~imamura/208/feb3/feb3.html">standard
solar model</A>? Are the neutrinos somehow disappearing en route to Earth,
perhaps by decaying into another kind of unknown particle which is even harder to
detect? Or, perhaps most strange of all, are the expected neutrinos mutating into
different kinds of neutrinos during their eight-minute flight from the solar core
(a hypothetical process called <A
HREF="http://zebu.uoregon.edu/~imamura/208/feb3/nucaws.html">neutrino
oscillation</A>)? Current evidence somewhat favors this last explanation, but the
case is still very much open.

<P>"We at the <A HREF="http://www.phys.hawaii.edu/sk/superk.html">University of
Hawaii</A> are participating in a new experiment in Japan, called <A
HREF="http://www.phys.washington.edu/~superk/">SuperKamiokande</A>. This project,
which began operation on April 1, 1996, already has received neutrino signals
from the sun and should be reporting significant results by the end of the year.
By several means, Super Kamiokande may be able to find the 'smoking gun'
indicating whether or not neutrino oscillations are hiding the neutrinos from the
sun. Yet another new experiment, the <A
HREF="http://www.laurentian.ca/www/physics/sno/choice.html">Sudbury Neutrino
Observatory</A> (SNO), will begin operations next year in Sudbury, Canada. SNO
will also help settle the question by collecting statistics on solar neutrinos
using a somewhat different detection technique.

<P>"Fortunately, the solar neutrino deficit does not seem to have any
implications for Earth, at least not in the short term. Nothing indicates that
the neutrino flux is decreasing nor that the rate of solar burning is slowing.
Hence, there is no cause for concern that the sun has somehow 'switched off,'
bringing on an ice age. There are indications of slight, long-term changes in <A
HREF="http://earth.agu.org/revgeophys/reid00/node2.html">solar output</A> as
occurred during the 17th-century Maunder Minimum, a period of depressed solar
activity when temperatures in Europe were unusually cold; these appear to be
transient phenomena, however.

<P>"The sun burns, fear not, and it will not soon fail us. In fact, even if we
learned that the nuclear fires at the center of the sun had completely
extinguished because the flux of neutrinos ceased (a scenario impossible by any
means we know), it would take a very long time very long time for anything
visible to occur, because the photons we see take about a million years to
diffuse to the surface of the sun. Humankind has many more imminent problems to
face."

<P><A HREF="http://nucth.physics.wisc.edu/personnel/baha/">A. Baha
Balantekin</A>, an expert in nuclear theory and astrophysics at the University of
Wisconsin, adds the following information, including a deeper exploration of the
background physics:

<P>"It probably is a good idea to talk about neutrinos first. More than half a
century after their existence was first postulated, we finally seem to be getting
close to understanding these elusive particles.

<P>"The neutrino was originally proposed as a solution to a serious problem
observed in the radioactive decays of certain atoms. In a process known as
nuclear beta decay, one of the neutrons in the decaying nucleus is transformed
into a proton, accompanied by the emission of an electron. The law of
conservation of energy--one of the most basic principles of physics--indicates
that all the electrons produced in this way should carry the same energy,
determined solely by the mass difference between the neutron and the proton (that
mass would be converted into its energy equivalent). In reality, however, the
electrons emitted by beta decay carry a continuous range of energy; some of them
carry all of the expected energy, but others emerge with hardly any energy at
all. Somehow energy seems to have been destroyed.

<P>"<A HREF="http://www.inforamp.net/~intkids/pauli.htm">Wolfgang Pauli</A>
recognized that the observations could be explained by assuming that radioactive
beta decays produce another, undetected particle--the neutrino--which shares the
released energy with the electron. Later, the existence of neutrinos was directly
<A HREF="http://www.ps.uci.edu/physics/news/nuexpt.html">confirmed</A> by <A
HREF="http://www.ps.uci.edu/physics/reinestrib.html">Frederick Reines</A> and
Clyde L. Cowan, Jr., who detected the inverse reaction, in which a neutrino is
captured by a proton, producing a neutron. Subsequent experiments demonstrated
that there are three different kinds of neutrinos, associated not only with
electrons but also with muons and tau particles, more massive cousins of the
electron.

<P>"Neutrinos have at most a tiny mass and only feebly interact with ordinary
matter. For a long time, therefore, little experimental information was available
about the properties of these particles; nobody even knew for sure if neutrinos
had any mass at all. That situation is starting to change. Strong indications of
neutrino oscillations, which can occur only if neutrinos have a mass, are now
seen in the observations of solar neutrinos, in studies of atmospheric neutrinos
and in some recent particle accelerator experiments. Cosmologists are intrigued
by these results; neutrinos are so common that they could actually make up a
significant fraction of the universe.

<P>"At about the time when Pauli postulated the existence of the neutrino, other
researchers deduced the basic mechanism by which the sun shines. The sun's energy
derives from nuclear fusion reactions taking place near its center. Most of this
energy emerges as light and other forms of electromagnetic radiation from the
solar surface, but about 3 percent of the energy is emitted as neutrinos. These
particles interact so little with matter that they can escape directly from the
solar core, where nuclear reactions are occurring. Electromagnetic radiation
(such as light) takes as much as a million years to reach to the surface, whereas
neutrinos arrive within seconds.

<P>"The first experiment designed to look for these solar neutrinos is located in
the Homestake mine in South Dakota. This detector has been collecting solar
neutrinos for the past 25 years using a cleaning fluid target--every once in a
while, a neutrino will interact with a chlorine atom in the fluid, transforming
it into an argon atom. Much to everyone's surprise, the number of neutrino counts
was significantly lower than expected. That pioneering experiment was joined by
several others within the past decade. One of these is the <A
HREF="http://osksn1.hep.sci.osaka-u.ac.jp/kamioka_Eng/kamioka.html">Kamiokande</A>
detector located in the Japanese Alps. Kamiokande is a water Cerenkov detector:
an incoming neutrino hits an electron in the water, making it move faster than
light does through water. Just as a Concorde jet emits a shock wave when it
starts moving faster than the sound in air, a high-energy electron traveling
faster than light in water will radiate a kind of radiation shock wave, known as
a Cerenkov cone of light. Unlike the Homestake experiment, Kamiokande could
detect the incoming directions of the neutrino and prove that they are indeed
coming from the sun. Kamiokande also found fewer neutrinos than predicted.

<P>"Both Homestake and Kamiokande are sensitive to relatively high-energy
neutrinos. Two other recent experiments using a gallium target (the <A
HREF="http://kosmopc.mpi-hd.mpg.de/GALLEX/gallex.htm">GALLEX</A> experiment in
the Gran Sasso tunnel in Italy and the SAGE experiment in Southern Russia) have
also detected the lower-energy solar neutrinos that make up the bulk of the solar
neutrino flux. Physics calculations give more reliable predictions of the
expected neutrino flux at low energies than at higher ones. But like the other
experiments, GALLEX and SAGE are detecting fewer neutrinos than the models
predict.

<P>"These solar neutrino observations are not easily reconciled with the
predictions of the standard solar model. All experiments observe a deficit, but
the amount of the deficit appears somewhat different in each experiment (except
the two gallium experiments, which agree with each other). Because the various
experiments are sensitive to different neutrino energies, it seems that the
amount of neutrino deficit is energy dependent.

<P>"It does not seem to be possible to explain away the neutrino deficit by
changing our assumptions about the physical makeup of the interior of the sun.
Indeed, given the new observations, we can say that a solar neutrino problem
exists independent of any detailed solar model--with 95 percent confidence, no
combination of low-, medium- and high-energy neutrino fluxes fits the
experimental data. A comparison of the fluxes detected at the various experiments
supports a theory known as neutrino oscillations: that electron-neutrinos from
the sun are transformed into other kinds of neutrinos (muon-neutrinos or
tau-neutrinos) that are more difficult to detect.

<P>"It does not seem likely that the neutrino shortfall is caused by a shutdown
in the core of the sun. If the fusion were simply switching off--that is, if the
sun were dying--the counts of all neutrinos (low-, medium- and high-energy ones)
would be reduced by about the same amount, but that is not what is observed.
Instead we seem to be discovering that neutrinos are more complex particles than
we initially thought."

or 'disk' galaxies. These galaxies are differentially rotating--that is, the time
to complete a full rotation increases with distance from the center. Differential
rotation causes any disturbance in the disk to wind up into a spiral form. The
trouble with this simple explanation is that the differential rotation would
cause spiral features to wind up too quickly, so galaxies would not look like
spirals for any appreciable length of time.

<P>"The second important piece of physics for understanding spiral structure is
that the stars and gas in the disk of the galaxy exert an appreciable
gravitational force. That force helps maintain the spiral form against the
tendency to wind up. Almost everyone agrees on this basic physics.

<P>"So, why do disk galaxies often have spiral shapes? There is observational
evidence that nearby companion galaxies or an asymmetric, bar-shaped
concentration of mass can drive a spiral wave in the disk of the galaxy. Disks
that lack such forcing features are the tricky ones to explain. One explanation
centers on the fact that gravitational systems act to increase their central
binding energy. Spiral arms remove angular momentum from the center of the
galaxy, allowing it to achieve a state of higher binding energy. There are two
main versions of the theory of spiraling: one in which the waves are steady and
long-lived, the other in which spirals are transient features that come and go.
The natural, but not very easy, test is to observe spiral galaxies for a few
hundred million years and see what happens."

<P><A HREF="http://noether.vassar.edu/Elmegreen.html">Debra M. Elmegreen</A>,
Maria Mitchell Professor of Astronomy at Vassar College, and Bruce G. Elmegreen,
staff scientist at the <A
HREF="http://www.zurich.ibm.com/Technology/CCP/cs.html">IBM T.J. Watson Research
Center</A>, have extensively studied this question. Here is their response:

<P>"Most spiral arms in galaxies are density waves, which are compression waves
(like sound) that travel through the disk and cause a piling-up of stars and gas
at the crest. The wave is temporarily sustained by the force of its own gravity,
but it eventually wraps up or gets absorbed at orbital resonances, places where
random stellar oscillations have the same period as the local wave.

<P>"In some galaxies, a large central bulge can prevent the wave from reaching a
resonance; the wave then reflects off the bulge, giving rise to a giant standing
spiral wave with a uniform rotation rate and a lifetime of perhaps 5 to 10 disk
rotations (roughly one to two billion years). In all cases, the stars and gas
rotate around the galaxy's center faster than the wave in the inner parts of the
disk, and slower than the wave in the outer parts. This differential rotation
forces gas to enter the wave at a high speed in the inner regions, causing it to
shock and form long, thin dust lanes in each spiral arm. Some density-wave
galaxies, like <A HREF="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/messier/m/m081.html">M81</A>,
have highly symmetric spiral arms; others, like <A
HREF="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/messier/m/m101.html">M101</A>, have several
arms and less overall symmetry. The difference between these two cases is related
to the symmetry of the perturbation that formed the arms in the first place, and
to the relative importance of the standing wave pattern, which tends to be
symmetric.

<P>"Density waves have many possible origins. A large central bar, such as is
seen in <A HREF="http://www.astro.ufl.edu/~kaufmann/ngc1300.gif">NGC 1300</A>,
may drive a two-arm density wave for a relatively long time, eventually causing
the gas in the outer disk to move outward and wrap into a giant ring at the edge
of the galaxy's disk. A companion galaxy can also generate a two-arm spiral by
tidal forces. Such tidal arms probably last only for several rotations before
they either wrap up and disappear or initiate a longer-lived standing wave. <A
HREF="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/messier/m/m051.html">The Whirlpool galaxy,
M51</A>, has companion-triggered spirals. Galaxies that appear in visible light
to have neither bars nor companions can still have spiral waves. These galaxies
may have hidden weak bars or small companions that trigger the spirals, or they
may be excited entirely by small asymmetries and perturbations within their
disks.

<P>"Some galaxies have no long spiral arms at all, but only numerous, short and
non-symmetric arms, as in the Sculptor group galaxy <A
HREF="http://www.seds.org/ftp/images/deepspace/gco/ngc7793.gif">NGC 7793</A>.
These arms are probably not density waves at all, but are short-lived
star-forming regions that are sheared into spiral-like pieces by differential
rotation of the galaxy. Such star-formation features last only as long as the
bright, high-mass stars that dominate their light--about a hundred million years,
less than a single rotation period of the galaxy. They apparently form when the
disk is too stable to sustain a wave, or when there are no perturbations that
could drive the formation of spiral arms."

<P><A HREF="http://electron.rutgers.edu/people/pdps/Sellwood.html">Jerry
Sellwood</A>, who studies stellar group dynamics at Rutgers University, provided
a helpful, broad overview of this area of research:

<P>"The first part of your question was posed in 1850 by the Irish astronomer
Lord Rosse after seeing the strikingly beautiful spiral pattern in Messier 51.
While astronomers now generally agree that the spiral patterns in the majority of
bright galaxies are density waves, experts still differ on how the arms are
formed.

<P>"A density wave is shorthand to describe the way stars in a galaxy are packed
a little more closely together in the arms and spread more thinly in between the
arms.  The density variations travel round the galaxy, much like a sound wave
through the air; therefore a spiral arm is not a simply a concentration of
co-orbiting stars and gas.

<P>"The problem of the origin of density waves is difficult because the billions
of stars in a galaxy all exert gravitational forces on each other. Just as we can
understand pressure in a gas without having to calculate the motions of
individual molecules, we can treat a galaxy as a massive 'stellar fluid,' but the
real difficulty stems from the long-range nature of the gravitational force. 
Computer simulations develop spirals spontaneously, confirming that gravitational
dynamics is the important physical process, but it is hard to understand how this
process works even inside the computer.

<P>"Fortunately, nearly every one agrees that spiral patterns extract
gravitational energy from the field of a galaxy.  The inexorable force of gravity
tries to pull the stars in a galaxy closer towards the center.  The gravitational
force is balanced by the orbital motion of a star (like a stone whirled on a
string) which generally prevents it from settling any deeper on average into the
galaxy.  The spiral arms are a kind of catalyst that brakes the orbital motion of
some stars, allowing them to sink slightly closer to the middle.  Those with
technical training will realize that if some stars lose angular momentum others
must gain equally and, in fact, the stars that lose are near the inner end of the
arms while those at the outer end gain.  The gravitational stresses arising from
the spiral density wave provide the torque.

<P>"So, just as in capitalist economics, the stars near the center of a galaxy
with little angular momentum have some taken away and given to those further out
that were already angular momentum rich.  Moreover, this process liberates
energy: the stars that settle slightly closer are in the strong field of the
inner galaxy, while the galaxy has a weaker hold on those that are pushed out.

<P>"Hence it is energetically favorable for spiral patterns to develop because
they provide the only possible torques to enable stars to become more tightly
bound to the inner galaxy.  Precisely what pulls on what to make the arms
develop, the how part of your question, is much harder. There are several
competing theories, all of which undoubtedly contain elements of truth, but none
has gained wide acceptance.

<P>"In the case of Messier 51, most experts agree that tides raised by the small
companion galaxy are probably responsible for some of its exceptionally regular
pattern, but too many galaxies display spiral arms for them all to be caused by
interactions.  Bars at the centers of galaxies are another idea that may drive
spirals, but <A HREF="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/messier/m/m033.html">Messier
33</A> provides a clear counter-example to indicate that bars are not a universal
mechanism either.  I personally hope that the explanation will eventually be
found in a recurrent dynamic instability (a flag flaps in a breeze because of a
recurrent instability), but this idea still needs a lot more work."

into the corona without heating up the surface?" </A></B></FONT>

<P>-<I>Leigh Peck<BR> Menlo Park, California</I>

<P>This question strikes at one of the most active areas of current astronomical
research. Not surprisingly, several scientists wrote in to give their answers.

<P><A HREF="http://donald.phast.umass.edu/Docs/GradProg/blerkom.html">David Van
Blerkom</A>, a professor of astronomy at the University of Massachusetts at
Amherst, provides a nice overview, focusing on the second part of the query:

<P>"The fact that the outermost region of the sun's atmosphere is at millions of
degrees while the temperature of the <A
HREF="http://www-solar.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/%7Ealan/sun_course/Introduction/Photosphere.html">underlying
photosphere</A> is only 6,000 kelvins (degrees C. above absolute zero) is quite
nonintuitive. One would have expected a gradual cooling as one moves away from
the central heat source. A related question is why, if the corona is so hot, it
does not heat up the photosphere until it has an equally high temperature.

<P>"I will address these questions in reverse order. Let us first ask what it
means for a gas to have a high temperature. The answer is that temperature is a
measure of the average kinetic energy of the gas atoms, that is, a measure of how
fast they are moving. A high temperature gas has atoms with a larger average
velocity than a low temperature gas of the same composition. We thus infer that
the atoms in the corona are moving much more rapidly than those in the
photosphere.

<P>"In order for the corona to make the photospheric temperature rise, the
coronal gas must cause the photospheric atoms to move faster. It could do so by
colliding and mixing with the cooler gas and thus transfering some of its kinetic
energy. Another way is also possible: At a temperature of millions of degrees,
the gas in the corona is highly ionized, that is, electrons are stripped off
neutral atoms and move freely. Because electrons are thousands of times less
massive than atoms, the hot electrons have very high speeds. These electrons
could travel into the photospheric gas and collide with the atoms there, again
increasing their velocities. These two heating mechanisms are called convection
and conduction, respectively.

<P>"A gas at millions of degrees also radiates energy; much of it is emitted in
the form of very high-energy x-ray photons. X-ray photons impinging on the
photosphere could also transfer energy to the gas atoms there. This heating
mechanism is radiation.

<P>"Yet the three traditional methods of heating do not raise the photospheric
temperature for a simple reason. Suppose, as a thought experiment, one had a
thermometer that could measure temperatures of millions of degrees and placed it
in the corona. In order to make a temperature measurement, the coronal atoms or
electrons must strike the thermometer, or x-ray photons must impinge upon it. The
corona, however, has such a low density that the thermometer will almost never be
hit. So while the thermometer is technically sitting in a gas that is at
2,000,000 kelvins, it doesn't know it. The gas has a high temperature but a low
heat content. There are just not enough atoms around to heat our hypothetical
thermometer or the underlying photosphere.

<P>"The question of why the corona has such a high temperature is harder to
explain, and probably the last word on the physical mechanism has not yet been
given. Most astronomers assume that the gas is heated by the magnetic field that
pervades the corona. The solar magnetic field has long been known to cause the
sunspot cycle, and the physical shape and activity in the corona also varies with
the sunspot cycle. Magnetic fields are known to be able to transfer large amounts
of energy to the solar atmosphere, sometimes explosively as in flares. Huge
magnetic loops can be seen to rise far into the corona, and it is quite plausible
that the solar magnetic field is the ultimate source of physical heating of the
corona."

<P>Vic Pizzo of the <A HREF="http://www.sel.bldrdoc.gov/">Space Environment
Center</A> in Boulder, Colo., reiterates how mysterious this process is:

<P>"The precise mechanism by which the corona overlying the solar surface is
heated to temperatures of one to two million kelvins remains one of the
outstanding problems of solar physics. It has long been suspected that turbulent
motions in the lower solar atmosphere are propagated outward as waves in some
form, which ultimately shock  the thin atmosphere above the surface (the
photosphere). The shocks thereby dissipate mechanical energy in the waves as
heat. When magnetic field lines reconnect, they release energy; some researchers
suspect that fine-scale magnetic reconnections above the sun's surface provide
the energy to heat the corona.

<P>"Whatever the cause, some heat does indeed leak back toward the solar surface,
but the total amount of energy so transported is really quite small, and cannot
raise the photospheric temperature very much. The reason for this is the
extremely rapid fall-off of mass density with height above the solar surface.
That is, although the material in the corona is very hot, it is also very
tenuous. Thus, the energy transported back toward the surface is dissipated into
an ever increasing mass of material as it works its way down, whereas the heat
transported outward is readily dissipated into the vacuum of space. "

<P>Leo Connolly, the chair of the department of physics at California State
University, San Bernardino, adds the following information:

<P>"You are quite right about the corona being much hotter than the photosphere
of the sun. The photosphere is the outer layer of the sun that produces the
visible light we receive. The corona is a large, tenuous layer of gas whose
structure is governed by the Sun's magnetic field. The gas in the corona is
actually escaping from the Sun, forming the solar wind.

<P>"What accelerates the atoms of gas to high velocity and temperature in the
corona? It is likely that the solar magnetic field provides the necessary energy,
but the mechanism is poorly understood. At the photosphere, the temperature is
about 6,000 kelvins. The region of interest is above the top of the photosphere,
where the temperature actually drops (to about 4,500 kelvins at a level of 500
kilometers above the photosphere). At 1,500 kilometers, the temperature starts to
rise and by 10,000 kilometers above the photosphere the temperature reaches one
million kelvins. Between 1,500 kilometers from the top of the photosphere and
10,000 kilometers is a region called the 'transition zone,' which is where the
atoms are accelerated. The corona starts at 10,000 kilometers and extends out to
about 10 million kilometers, where the gas finally escapes the sun's gravity and
becomes part of the solar wind.

<P>"We know that atoms, stripped of one or more electrons, are trapped by
magnetic fields and move along the field lines. But what causes these atoms to be
accelerated, producing the high temperatures of the corona, is not understood.
All we know is that it definitely occurs in the transition zone."

<P>Last but not least, <A HREF="http://albert.astro.williams.edu/jpasachoff/">Jay
M. Pasachoff</A>, Chair of the Department of Astronomy at Williams College in
Williamstown, Mass., offers a perspective on some of the current attempts
(including his own) to solve the riddle of the solar corona:

<P>"One of the nice things about astronomy is that questions that are simply
phrased often turn out to be profound. The manner in which the solar corona is
heated to millions of degrees Celsius is one of the important unsolved problems
of astrophysics. I have conducted experiments during a series of total solar
eclipses to address the question, and there has been much theoretical work in
this area recently. The problem was much addressed at a NATO Advanced Research
Workshop on Observational and Theoretical Problems Related to Solar Eclipses,
held in Bucharest, Romania in the first week of June 1996; the proceedings of
that workshop will be available in a year or two.

<P>"Basically, one cannot account for the heating of the corona by a radiative
flow, so we think the corona is heated by some sort of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)
wave flowing out of lower levels of the sun. Images of the sun in the far
ultraviolet and in X-rays (acquired most recently by the <A
HREF="http://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov/">Solar and Heliospheric Observatory</A>
spacecraft, the <A
HREF="http://www.space.lockheed.com/SXT/homepage.html">Yohkoh</A> satellite, and
the <A HREF="http://hea-www.harvard.edu/SSXG/XBP/">NIXT</A> rockets) show that
the heating of the corona is localized in solar active regions, which indicates
the important role played by the magnetic field. There are perhaps a dozen
specific models that have been proposed to account for the high temperature of
the corona. These models involve fast-mode MHD waves, slow-mode MHD waves, Alfren
waves, et cetera. The older idea that acoustic waves flowing out of lower levels
heats the corona was abandoned in the 1970s, when the Orbiting Solar Observatory
8 spacecraft did not see such waves in the chromosphere, the layer just above the
photosphere (the apparent 'surface' of the sun in visible light). It remains
possible, however, that some acoustic waves can be formed at higher levels.

<P>"My work on the coronal heating problem is summarized in my chapter
'Measurements of 1-Hz coronal oscillations at total eclipses and their
implications for coronal heating,' in Mechanisms of Chromospheric and Coronal
Heating (Proceedings of the Heidelberg Conference), edited by P. Ulmschneider, E.
R. Priest and R. Rosner (Springer-Verlag, 1991). The book also contains many
other theoretical and observational papers."

star? And why didn't Jupiter become a real star?" </A></B></FONT>

<P>-<I>R. Goldberg<BR> via email</I>

<P>What indeed is the difference between a big planet and a small star? The
recent discovery of massive planets around other stars has aroused a lot of
debate on this very point. Alan P. Boss of the Carnegie Institution of Washington
is one of the theorists trying to clarify which bodies qualify as planets and
which as so-called <A
HREF="http://www.stsci.edu/pubinfo/background-text/brdwarfs.txt">"brown
dwarfs"</A>-objects smaller than stars but fundamentally unlike planets. He
answers the question as follows.

<P>"Nearly all scientists who study the <A
HREF="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/billa/tnp/origin.html">formation of planets</A>
believe that Jupiter formed in a very different manner than stars form, so that
calling Jupiter a 'failed star' is misleading. Stars form directly from the
collapse of dense clouds of interstellar gas and dust. Because of rotation, these
clouds form flattened disks that surround the central, growing stars. After the
star has nearly reached its final mass, by accreting gas from the disk, the
leftover matter in the disk is free to form planets.

<P>"Jupiter is generally believed to have formed in a two-step process. First, a
vast swarm of ice and rock 'planetesimals' formed. These comet-sized bodies
collided and accumulated into ever-larger planetary embryos. Once an embryo
became about as massive as ten Earths, its self-gravity became strong enough to
pull in gas directly from  the disk. During this second step, the proto-Jupiter
gained most of its present mass (a total of 318 times the mass of the Earth).
Soon thereafter, the disk gas was removed by the intense early solar wind, before
Saturn could grow to a similar size."

<P>Boss explains further that brown dwarfs may look like planets but they form
like stars--that is, they collapse directly from a gas cloud, rather than
building up in the disk around a star. Brown dwarfs lack sufficient mass to
shine, so they might more fairly be described as "failed stars."

<P>Alex Rudolph of the physics department at Harvey Mudd College expands on this
important point:

<P>"Jupiter is called a failed star because it is made of the same elements
(hydrogen and helium) as is the Sun, but it is not massive enough to have the
internal pressure and temperature necessary to cause hydrogen to fuse to helium,
the energy source that powers the sun and most other stars.

<P>"However, Jupiter has only about 0.1 percent the mass of the sun, and as it is
definitely not a star, we can't really call the solar system a double star.  It
is interesting to note, however, that more than half of all stars in the sky are
part of a binary, triple, or higher multiple star system (binaries being the most
common). So the Sun is unusual in being a loner.

<P>"As for why Jupiter failed to become a star--it probably had to do with the
accident of the sun grabbing most of the mass early in the formation of the solar
system, while in other systems the mass was more equitably distributed; in binary
star systems, for example, the masses of the stars are commonly roughly equal.
Stellar formation is a hot topic of current research, as astronomers are trying
to fathom the still-mysterious details of the birth process."

"Is it just a coincidence that the moon's period of
rotation and revolution are identical, so that we always see the same face? If
not, how did this situation come to be?" </A></B></FONT>

<P>-<I>Dan Snead<BR> Beckley, West Virginia</I>

<P>Alan P. Boss of the Carnegie Institution of Washington provides an answer to
this question as well:

<P>"The <A HREF="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/billa/tnp/luna.html">moon</A> keeps
the same face pointing towards the Earth because its rate of spin is tidally
locked so that it is synchronized with its rate of revolution (the time needed to
complete one orbit). In other words, the moon rotates exactly once every time it
circles the Earth.

<P>"The same forces that create tides in the Earth's oceans (from the
gravitational pull of the moon and, to a lesser extent, the sun) also act on the
solid body of the moon. The Earth's gravitational force on the moon distorts the
moon into a slightly prolate, or football, shape; in addition the moon's
intrinsic form is somewhat egg-shaped. If the tip of the football/egg does not
point toward  the Earth, then gravitational forces exert a torque that makes the
tip point back toward the Earth (in reality, the moon oscillates a small amount
around perfect alignment, a motion called the lunar libration)."

<P>It is very unlikely that the moon started out synchronized; that would indeed
be a surprising "coincidence."  As Boss explains, "The moon's synchronous spin
state is thought to have arisen billions of years ago, when the moon was much
closer to the Earth, and so tidal forces were much stronger than at present. The
Earth's gravity maintained this spin state even as other gravitational
interactions caused the moon to move outward to its present orbital radius."

"According to the big bang, space itself is
expanding. I don't understand: If space is expanding, into what is it expanding?"
</A></B></FONT>

<P>-<I>B. C. Dozier<BR> Kerrville, Tex.</I>

<P><A HREF="http://physics.ucsc.edu/people/personal/primack.html">Joel R.
Primack</A>, a cosmologist at the University of California at Santa Cruz, notes
that the big bang involves physical processes quite unlike those of everyday
experience. For that reason, people often find it quite difficult to grasp what
astronomers mean when they refer to an Rexpanding universe.

<P>One common misconception, Primack says, is "that the big bang is an explosion
that occurred at some point in a preexisting static space--which is not a picture
in accord with our modern theory of space-time and gravity." He explains why this
image of the big bang as an explosion in space, like the detonation of a bomb, is
incorrect:

<P>"According to modern cosmological theory, based on <A
HREF="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/%7Ehistory/HistTopics/General_relativity.html#63">Einstein's
General Relativity</A> (our modern theory of gravity), the big bang did not occur
somewhere in space; it occupied the whole of space. Indeed, it created space.
Distant galaxies are not traveling at a high speed through space; instead, just
like our own galaxy, they are moving relatively slowly with respect to any of
their neighboring galaxies. It is the expansion of space, between the time when
the stars in these distant galaxies emitted light and our telescopes receive it,
that causes the wavelength of the light to lengthen (redshift). Space is itself
infinitely elastic; it is not expanding into anything."

<P>The lengthening, or redshifting, of light that Primack describes was first
observed by <A HREF="http://pao.gsfc.nasa.gov/gsfc/weekly/96-6.htm">Edwin
Hubble</A> in 1929. This phenomenon is often referred to, incorrectly, as a
Doppler shift. A Doppler redshift results from the expansion of light emitted by
a receding object. Cosmological redshifts result from the expansion of space (and
the light moving through that space) between us and a distant galaxy or quasar.
Space is expanding everywhere, so the more distant an object is, the more rapidly
it appears to be moving away.

<P>Primack then considers another aspect of the reader's question: What lies
beyond our cosmic horizon, the visible "edge" of the universe?

<P>"Every observer in the universe is surrounded by a sphere beyond which nothing
can be seen: the observer's cosmic horizon (the point at which the apparent
recessional velocity equals the speed of light). Because it is the expansion of
space rather than the high velocity of distant galaxies that prevents us from
seeing beyond our cosmic horizon, there is no reason to suppose that galaxies
outside it are any different from those inside it. Indeed, the extreme isotropy,
or smoothness, of the cosmic background radiation (it appears to have the same
temperature in all directions, to about one part in 100,000), together with the
law of General Relativity and other physical assumptions that seem reasonable,
implies that the universe must remain pretty much the same out to a considerable
distance beyond our horizon.

<P>"The theory of cosmic inflation, a recent elaboration of the big bang,
suggests that at still greater distances, the universe is very different from the
way it is locally. Although we cannot check this prediction directly, other
predictions of inflation are being tested by new observations, especially those
to be made by the astronomy satellites that NASA and the European Space Agency
plan to launch in the next five to 10 years. There are many books that discuss
current theories of the expansion of the universe and related topics. Of these,
my favorite one is Cosmology, by Edward R. Harrison (Cambridge University Press,
1981)."

<P>Takamasa Takahashi of St. Norbert College adds a few comments:

<P>"Many scientists do not ask 'What came before the big bang?' because it is
beyond the scope of our physical theories. Usually we consider the big bang to be
the beginning of time and space, and so it is meaningless to ask what existed
before or what lies beyond the expanding universe. Because space itself is
intimately connected with matter in the universe, as matter was created in the
big bang, so was space. There is no 'empty space' that the universe is expanding
into."

"What is 'gel electrophoresis,' and why is it so important for DNA testing in
criminal cases?"
</A></B></FONT>

<P>--<I>Edward Park<BR> Austin, Tex.</I>

<P>Eric Fairfield is a private researcher who uses gel electrophoresis for
separation of DNA molecules; he won an R&D award for the invention of a new
method of gel electrophoresis. He replies:

<P>"DNA is a charged molecule. Consequently, DNA molecules will move when an
electrical field is applied to a liquid in which they are dissolved. If the
liquid is a simple one--such as water with some salts in it--all the DNA
molecules move at nearly the same speed. Under those conditions, it is hard to
distinguish the tiny disparities in the motion of different kinds of DNA.

<P>"If the solution is made less liquid, as in a gel, and the DNA molecules all
start moving across the solution from some initial small volume--that is, from
essentially the same staring point--then the molecules can move at perceptibly
different speeds. Usually smaller DNA molecules move faster than larger ones.
After a while, the molecules are separated by size. If the molecules fall into
only a few discreet sizes, then bands (little rectangles) of DNA will appear in
the gel. Each of these bands contains DNA strands of a specific size."

<P>[Editors note: <a
href="http://www.gene.com/ae/AB/IWT/DNA_Fingerprinting_Basics.html"TARGET="_top">DNA
fingerprinting</a> uses gel electrophoresis to distinguish between samples of the
genetic material. The human DNA molecules are treated with enzymes that chop them
at certain characteristic points, thereby reducing the DNA to a collection of
more manageably sized pieces. The DNA fragments are loaded into a gel and placed
in an electrical field, which electrophoretically sorts the DNA fragments into
various bands. These bands can be colored with a radioactive dye to make them
visible to imaging techniques.]

<P>"For individual people, the bands of DNA created through this process will
have a pattern that is specific to the individual. Part of this pattern comes
from the size of the DNA; part of it comes from the sequence of the DNA of a
specific size.

<P>"In forensics, <a href="http://ep.llnl.gov/teacher_prog/bepfing.html"TARGET="_top">suspects
can be eliminated</a> if their DNA pattern does not match the pattern of DNA
molecules found at the crime scene. Other people may become suspects become if
their DNA pattern matches the pattern of the person who committed the crime and
if the suspect's DNA pattern is not very common. The idea behind 'not very
common' is that the DNA says, in essence, 'This crime was committed by a 6'2"
white male who has a scar on the left wrist, went to U.C.L.A., drives a red 1992
sports car, makes $62,000 a year and was a disc jockey in 1978.' While there may
be more than one such person, it is not likely that more than one of them was at
the scene of the crime at the same time."<P>

"Human evolution appears to be associated with a trend toward greater
intelligence. Is there a discernible trend toward greater intelligence in other
species as well? And if cognitive ability confers an evolutionary advantage, why
are humans (apparently) so unique in this trait?"
</A></B></FONT>

<P>--<I>Kwan Lowe<br>Hollywood, Fla.</I>

<P>This is an extremely complicated and controversial topic. <A HREF="http://www.brynmawr.edu/Adm/ABMC/faculty/grobstein.html">Paul Grobstein</A> in the
department of biology at Bryn Mawr College offers the following thoughts:

<P>"These are fascinating questions, but I have to start with a warning. '
Intelligence' and 'cognitive ability' are concepts that are probably too ill
defined to use in relation to either evolutionary trends or mechanisms. It is
increasingly apparent that both words are umbrella terms covering a large variety
of distinguishable skills, processing abilities and attributes, which different
organisms possess to different degrees. Antonio Damasio's recent book, <a
href="http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/bb/damasio/descartes.html"><I>Descartes'
Error</I></a> (Avon Books, New York, 1994), provides a particularly clear example
of the underlying complexity of these concepts in the case of humans, showing
compellingly that ' intelligence,' as we usually use the term, depends
fundamentally on both rationality and emotion. Whether it will ever be possible
to define the meanings of intelligence and cognitive ability sufficiently clearly
to use them for the kinds of questions you are asking is uncertain at best.

<P>It is, however, possible to talk about both evolutionary trends and evolutionary
advantages in relation to a better-defined variable: brain size. For exactly the
reasons mentioned above, it is not possible to equate brain size with either
intelligence or cognitive abilities. But studying brain size yields insights that
may be relevant nonetheless. Useful observations were documented and discussed in
an article by Harry J. Jerison in <I>Scientific American ('Paleoneurology and the
Evolution of Mind",</I> January 1976). Brain size--or, more accurately, brain size
in relation to body size--has clearly increased over evolutionary time, not only
in human lineages but in those of many other groups of organisms as well. In
general, however, what has occurred is not the replacement of smaller- brained
organisms by larger-brained ones but rather an expansion of the range of brain
sizes: larger-brained organisms appear later in time, but smaller-brained
organisms continue to persist. The only really valid criterion for evolutionary
success is current existence, so the conclusion would seem to be that large
brains do not, in general, confer an evolutionary advantage over small brains.
Instead large and small brains seem to represent different but equally good
evolutionary outcomes.

<P>"It is helpful to bear in mind that trends in evolution do not necessarily mean
that later-appearing organisms have an evolutionary advantage (that is, are in
some way 'better than') over earlier ones. This important general principle most
likely applies in the cases of intelligence and cognitive ability, however one
comes to understand those terms. Evolution is the continuing exploration of the
viability of randomly created variants of preexisting life-forms. Hence, a
feature that appears later in evolution means that it is a novel alternative, but
not necessarily a ' better' one.

<P>"That much is reasonably clear, but it leaves an intriguing, nagging question,
along with some additional observations about brain size. There certainly seem to
be some meaningful mental attributes that humans (and at least some other
contemporary organisms) have more of than did prior ancestors. Furthermore, the
recent human lineage (and at least some other animal lineages) does seem to show
not only the emergence of creatures having larger brains but in addition their
replacement of creatures having smaller brains.

<P>"These two issues are brought together in an interesting way by Christopher Wills
in his book <I>The Runaway Brain</I> (BasicBooks, 1993). Wills suggests that
larger brain size is associated with increased capacity to handle sensory
information and hence with increased flexibility as well as decreased
predictability in behavior. The latter innovation would then, in turn, exert
selection pressure for increased brain size on other animals, whose survival
relates to, among other things, their ability to predict behavior. These
resulting increases in brain size would, of course, generate pressure for further
increases in brain size. It is because of this positive feedback loop that Wills
refers to the 'runaway brain.'

<P>"I suspect that unpredictability in behavior is not the first thought that comes
to mind when people hear the terms "intelligence" or "cognitive ability," but <a
href="http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/bb/EncyHumBehav.html" >variability</a> may in
fact be an important component of what we mean by those terms. And Wills's notion
of a positive feedback loop helps to emphasize that the selection pressures
operating in evolution very much include those resulting from other organisms. A
positive feedback loop also provides a satisfying and perhaps generally useful
explanation for otherwise puzzling directional trends in evolution.

<P>"So are larger brains actually 'better'? If Wills is right, the answer depends to
a significant extent on whether or not there are other, larger brains around; in
this case, increasing brain size is part of an evolutionary experiment whose
future outcome is uncertain, as true of all evolutionary processes. On the other
hand, if Wills is right, we (and some other animals) can all count on not
becoming bored--and, perhaps, on becoming steadily wiser or, at least, steadily
<a href="http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/sci_cult/truth.html">less wrong</a>)."

"What is known about the function of introns, the nonencoding
sequences in genes?"</A></B></FONT>

<P>-<I>Angelica Cibrian Jaramillo<BR>Texcoco, Mexico</I>

<P>This question relates to a curious feature of how genetic
information is
organized in the DNA of many organisms. The sequence of bases
that make up
DNA encode a corresponding sequence of amino acids which make up
proteins.
Molecular biologists had at first assumed that in a gene, all
the DNA
coding for a protein would be continuous, and that is what they
found when
they first looked at the genes of prokaryotes (bacteria and
other simple
cells). When researchers looked at more complex (eukaryotic)
cells,
however, they found that the encoding DNA is typically
discontinuous:
stretches of encoding DNA (called exons) are interspersed with
long
stretches of non-encoding DNA (called introns). After the DNA is
transcribed into a string of RNA--but before the RNA is
translated into
protein--the introns are edited out. Although introns have
sometimes been
loosely called "junk DNA," the fact that they are so common and
have been
preserved during evolution leads many researchers to believe
that they
serve some function.

<P>Ashok Bidwai, an assistant professor in the <A
HREF="http://hermes.icrc.wvu.edu/biology/facdir.html">department
of
biology</A> at West Virginia University, elaborates:

<P>"It is widely believed that introns are remnants of genetic
sequences that
once served as spacers between the stretches of DNA that coded
for
specific, comparatively simple proteins. During the evolution of
complex
proteins, regions of the genetic code (known as domains) may
have been
shuffled and brought together to generate new sequences that
code for
novel protein structures that took on new functions. This
hypothesis is
based on the observation that the relative positions of introns
in genes
remain largely the same in organisms as diverse as <I>Drosophila
melanogaster</I> (the fruit fly), <I>Caenorhabditis elegans</I>
(a widely
studied nematode), mice and humans. Walter Gilbert of Harvard
University
has laid out many of the details of this hypothesis. 

<P>"In addition, some researchers have proposed that introns
serve as a
mechanism that selects for genes that will be expressed early
(rather than
late) during the development of an organism. This idea is not
based on
extensive experimentation, however, so its plausibility is
uncertain."

<P><A HREF="http://golgi.harvard.edu/sandro/">Sandro J. de
Souza</A>, who
works in <A HREF="http://golgi.harvard.edu/gilbert.html">Walter
Gilbert's
laboratory</A> at Harvard University, expands on the prevailing
intron
hypothesis:

<P>"Questions about the function of introns appeared immediately
after their
discovery in 1977. What is the role of introns? Why are they
here in our
genes? Almost 20 years later we still do not have definitive
answers, even
though some DNA databases now contain around 500 megabases of
sequences--that is, strings of genetic code that represent 500
million
chemical letters of our genome.

<P>"First, let's start with some classifications. There are at
least five
different types of introns. Some of them are ribozymes, RNA
molecules that
are catalytically active, meaning that they facilitate certain
chemical
reactions; some of these ribozymes are able to perform a
reaction in which
they splice themselves out of the original transcript. The most
common
type of intron is called a spliceosomal or nuclear intron; the
name comes
from the cellular machinery, known as the spliceosome, which is
responsible for splicing and making sure that the genetic
sequences in
introns are not translated into junk proteins. This type of
intron is the
one found in the nuclear genes of humans. 

<P>"In general, nuclear introns are widespread in complex
eukaryotes, or
higher organisms. Simple prokaryotes and eukaryotes (such as
fungi and
protozoa) lack them. In complex multicellular organisms (such as
plants
and vertebrates), introns are about 10-fold longer than the
exons, the
active, coding parts of the genome. The sequence and length of
introns
vary rapidly over evolutionary time. 

<P>"Introns do sometimes have identifiable functions. Scientists
have found
clear examples of 'functional nuclear introns' that can
accommodate
sequences important for the expression of the gene on which the
intron
resides. This function is not a general feature of introns,
however,
because several genes that lack introns express themselves
normally
(histones and olfactory receptor genes, for instance). There are
also
cases in which introns contain genes for small nuclear RNA,
which is
important for the translation of messenger RNA, an intermediary
between
DNA and proteins. Nuclear introns can also be important in a
process
called alternative splicing, which can produce multiple types of
messenger
RNA from a single gene. Although these examples demonstrate a
constructive
role for introns, they cannot explain why introns are so
ubiquitous in our
genes. 

<P>"In 1978 Walter Gilbert of Harvard expressed a different view
of the
nature of introns (in the same report in which he coined the
terms 'exon'
and 'intron'). He suggested that introns could speed up
evolution by
promoting genetic recombinations between exons. This process
(which he
called 'exon shuffling') would be directly associated with
formation of
new genes. Introns, from this perspective, have a profound
purpose. They
serve as hot spots for recombination in the formation of new
combinations
of exons. In other words, they are in our genes because they
have been
used during evolution as a faster pathway to assemble new genes.
Over the
past 10 years, the exon shuffling idea has been supported by
data from
various experimental approaches. 

<P>"Several genome projects will be concluded in the next
decade. They are
expected to yield a huge amount of information about intron
sequences. The
new data should solve most of our basic questions about the
functions of
introns."

"Why is it that eating spicy, "hot" food causes the same physical
reactions as does physical heat (burning and sweating, for
instance)?"</A></B></FONT>

<P>-<I>Richard Konicek<BR> Amherst, Mass.</I>

<P>Barry Green of <A HREF="http://www.jbpierce.com/" TARGET="_top">John B. Pierce
Laboratory</A> in New Haven, Conn., replies:<P>

"The answer hinges on the fact that spicy foods excite the
receptors in the skin that normally respond to heat. Those
receptors are pain fibers, technically known as polymodal <A
HREF="http://www.telalink.net/~nnpc/page2.html" TARGET="_top">nociceptors</A>.
They respond to temperature extremes and to intense mechanical
stimulation, such as pinching and cutting; they also respond to
certain chemical influences. The central nervous system can be
confused or fooled when these pain fibers are stimulated by a
chemical, like that in <A
HREF="http://members.visi.net/~mandy/pepguide.html" TARGET="_top">chile
peppers</A>, which triggers an ambiguous neural response.<P>

"So how does the brain decide whether the mouth is being
pinched, cut, burned or affected by chemical? Scientists are not
certain how the process works, but probably the brain makes a
judgment based on the type and variety of stimuli being
received. Stimulus to the nociceptors alone might indicate
dangerous, extreme temperature. But <A
HREF="http://neptune.netimages.com/~chile/capsaicin_structure.html"
TARGET="_top">capsaicin</A>,
the active ingredient in chile peppers, also stimulates the
nerves that respond only to mild increases in temperature--the
ones that give the sensation of moderate warmth. So capsaicin
sends two messages to the brain: 'I am an intense stimulus,' and
'I am warmth.' Together these stimuli define the sensation of a
burn, rather than a pinch or cut.<P>

"The central nervous system reacts to whatever the sensory
system tells it is going on. Therefore, the pattern of activity
from pain and warm nerve fibers triggers both the sensations and
the physical reactions of heat, including vasodilation, sweating
and flushing.<P>

"Most people think of the 'burn' of spicy food as a form of
taste. In fact, the two sensory experiences are related but are
very distinct. They innervate the tongue the same way, but the
pain system that is triggered by capsaicin is everywhere on the
body, so one can get thermal effects everywhere. Some liniments
contain compounds that produce similar temperature stimuli to
the nerves in the skin. Menthol acts in much the same way as
capsaicin, but in this case, it stimulates the fibers that
register cold temperatures, not those that respond to warmth.
This is why products containing menthol have names like 'Icy
Hot'--menthol stimulates both the hot (pain) and cold receptors,
sending the brain a really ambiguous signal. That difference
explains why there is no confusing menthol and capsaicin: one
gives rise to a cool burn, the other to a hot burn.<P>

"The sensations produced by menthol and capsaicin are accidents
of human physiology--we obviously did not evolve receptors to
react to these compounds. The chemicals fool pain receptors
whose real purpose is to register critical events, like damage
to the skin and the inflamation that often results. The
tenderness around an injury is caused in part by the response of
these same nerves to chemicals released in the skin. We humans
are peculiar creatures--we've taken a nerve response that
normally signals danger and turned it into something
pleasurable."<P>

"When did eukaryotic cells (cells with nuclei and other internal organelles)
first evolve? What do we know about how they evolved from earlier
life-forms?"</A></B></FONT>

<P>-<I>Tara Murphy<BR>Sydney, Australia</I>

<P>The origin of the <A
HREF="http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/alllife/eukaryota.html">eukaryotes</A>--the
kingdom of life that includes all of the higher plants and animals,
including ourselves--took place in the heavily obscured early history of the
earth. Consequently, there is still much speculation involved in answering
this question. <A HREF="http://www.life.uiuc.edu/Micro/woese.html">Carl
Woese</A>, a professor of microbiology at the University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign and the discoverer of archaebacteria, offers one reply:

<P>"Evidence from microfossils strongly suggests that life arose on the earth
long ago, probably within a few hundred million years of the planet's
formation. Sedimentary rocks 3.5 billion years old (and perhaps those 3.8
billion years old) contain what appear to be fossil <A
HREF="http://www.uc.edu/~acombty/stromatolites.html">stromatolites</A>,
which are natural colonies formed by photosynthetic bacteria; within the
stromalites one can see microscopic forms reminiscent of bacteria. If these
presumed bacteria are direct ancestors of extant photosynthetic bacteria,
life was already well developed by then, having passed through the stages
that led to the most recent universal ancestor and the splitting of the
ancestral lineage into the primary lines of descent. 

<P>"By comparing molecular sequences to infer genealogies, molecular
phylogeneticists tell us that the two primary lines of descent lead to the
eubacteria (or common bacteria, which include the photosynthetic bacteria)
and to a second common lineage that subsequently divided to form the archaea
(which like the eubacteria are prokaryotes) and the eukaryotes (which
include all higher plants and animals). All these events appear to have
preceded the oldest fossil stromatolites. So the eukaryotic lineage appears
to be very ancient, about as ancient as the two prokaryotic lineages.

<P>"The key unanswered question here concerns when on the eukaryotic line the
eukaryotic type of cell formed. Eukaryotic cells seem structurally far more
complex than their prokaryotic counterparts (from which they arose), so
biologists generally believe that many evolutionary steps must have
separated the two. Nevertheless, the eukaryotic stem on the phylogenetic
tree of life spawns many branches before one gets to the split that
separates the ancestors of plants from the ancestors of animals, which seems
to have happened more than a billion years ago. There seem to have been many
earlier branchings from the eukaryotic stem, all represented by unicellular
eukaryotes (such as the slime molds, the flagellates, the trichomonads, the
diplomonads, the microsporidia, among others). 

<P>"Clearly, eukaryotic history goes back far into the era when the earth's
atmosphere contained little or no oxygen, well over two billion years ago.
Our current concept of the origin of the eukaryotic cell is in flux,
however, and an evolutionary sequence that appears simple when
conceptualized on a phylogenetic tree diagram may be far more complex and
interesting in reality. We know that the eukaryotic cell is of ancient
origin, but we do not yet know the evolutionary dynamic that underlies its
formation."

<P>J. Peter Gogarten in the department of molecular and cell biology at the
University of Connecticut at Storrs, gives a broader overview:

<P>"The question is the subject of an ongoing and lively controversy. The best
guesses for the time when eukaryotes evolved range from just below 2.0
billion years to around 3.5 billion years before the present. 

<P>"One of the less ambiguous sources of information is the fossil record. Work
by Gonzalo Vidal of the <A
HREF="http://strix.udac.uu.se/kat/deps/GE2.html">University of Uppsala</A>
in Sweden indicates that single-celled planktonic eukaryotes certainly date
back to 1.7 billion years B.P. and very likely to at least 2.2 billion years
B.P. The early fossil record is very sparse, however, and small eukaryotic
cells present in the fossil record would not necessarily have been
positively identified. My colleagues generally agree that the fossil record
provides only a most recent estimate for the time when eukaryotes were
already abundant; they might have been around a long time before they made
it into the fossil record in a recognizable form. 

<P>"Another approach is to date phylogenies by looking at a 'clock' of
molecular changes that accumulate in the genetic code. Although that
approach has been successfully used to decipher relations between organisms,
calibrating it to measure the time elapsed since the divergence of
phylogenetic branches is problematic; concerning the early evolution of
life, there is no generally accepted approach. Most attempts to date early
molecular phylogenetic trees used the emergence of eukaryotes (around 2.0
billion years B.P.) as a calibration point. <A
HREF="http://glamdring.ucsd.edu/faculty_info/old/DOOLITTLE_R.html">Russell
F. Doolittle</A> and his co-workers at the University of California at San
Diego recently attempted to extend the calibration further into the past,
but this work is contested. The controversy centers on possible cases of
horizontal gene transfer across phylogenetic branches that were ignored by
these authors and on an insufficient correction for multiple substitutions.
In addition, these backward extrapolations assume that the rate of molecular
change at the time the eukaryotes originated is the same as it was during
the metazoan evolution, when in fact it was probably much faster. 

<P>"The typical eukaryotic cell resulted from a symbiosis between different
prokaryotic ancestors. Three prokaryotic components can be traced by
comparing molecules in extant prokaryotes and eukaryotes. These components
are the mitochondria (derived from purple bacteria), the plastids (from
cyanobacteria), and the nucleocytoplasmic component (from archaebacteria).
Other features in eukaryotic cells--for instance, the cytoskeleton--may also
be of bacterial descent, but so far the molecular record has not yielded
unambiguous clues as to their origin. 

<P>"The nucleocytoplasmic component of the eukaryotic cell branches off very
early in the evolutionary radiation of the archaebacteria. There is an
active dispute as to whether some of the archaebacteria are more closely
related to the eukaryotic nucleocytoplasm than are others (proponents of the
differing views are James Lake of the University of California at Los
Angeles and Carl Woese of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign).
Regardless of how the debate is resolved, the ancestor of the eukaryotic
nucleocytoplasm must have separated from the archaebacteria early in, or
even before, the era when the major archaebacterial groups arose. In
contrast, bacterial ancestors of mitochondria and plastids separated from
the eubacteria lineage only after the evolutionary radiation that gave rise
to the major eubacterial kingdoms. Therefore, it is likely that primitive
eukaryotes lacking mitochondria and plastids were around a long time before
they made it into the fossil record. I would be surprised if such eukaryotes
did not date back to at least 3.0 billion years before the present."

"Why do muscles tremble after strenuous exercise?"</A></B></FONT>

<P>-<I>Thomas Caldwell<BR>Gaithersburg, Md.</I>

<P>Loren G. Martin, professor of physiology at Oklahoma State University in
Tulsa, responds:

<P>"Let's start by examining what happens when you exercise. In skeletal
muscle, the cells never contract individually. Rather they contract as
groups of muscle cells that are collectively connected to a motor nerve
originating in the spinal cord; the combination of the motor nerve cell
(neuron) and the muscle cells it innervates is known as the motor unit. 

<P>"The size of the motor units determines the precision of movement that a
particular muscle can produce. For example, in the muscles of the larynx, or
voice box, each motor nerve usually connects to only two or three individual
muscle cells, allowing very fine gradations of strength. On the other hand,
large muscles that serve gross movement--such as the gastrocnemius muscle in
the lower leg--have motor units made up of motor nerves that each control
2,000 or more muscle cells.

<P>"These motor units are not all excited simultaneously when a muscle is
electrically excited and made to contract. In fact, the units are excited in
a most asynchronous fashion by the trains of electrical impulses that come
down the motor nerves from the spinal cord. As a result, while some of the
motor units are contracting and shortening within the muscle belly, others
will be relaxing and lengthening. The tremendous amount of overlap between
motor units gives the appearance that the muscle is contracting smoothly
overall. 

<P>"Strenuous exercise causes some of the motor units to drop out of service
because of fatigue; it is this process that is ultimately responsible for
the trembling you observe. Most of the fatigue probably occurs within the
spinal cord at the level of the motor nerve cell and its neural connections,
although some fatigue probably occurs also at the connections between this
motor nerve and its muscle cells (the myoneural junction). Both these areas
require the synthesis and release of particular chemicals to carry the
electrical impulse across to either another nerve cell or a muscle cell.
Researchers generally believe that the chemical cannot be manufactured and
released fast enough to keep up with the level of activity, so it becomes
depleted in this area of transmission. The depletion of these chemicals is a
big part of what fatigue means in a biochemical sense.

<P>"As more and more motor units become temporarily nonfunctional, the muscle
contraction becomes dependent on fewer and fewer motor units. The dropout of
the fatigued motor units causes the remaining individual contractions and
relaxations to become on average more synchronous and less smoothly
organized; the original overall appearance of a smooth contraction is
replaced with a jerky, trembling movement now that many of the overlapping
motor units have ceased to function. After adequate rest, the fatigued motor
units return to normal, and the muscle again appears to produce a smooth
contractile motion."

<P>"Numerous insects, such as common houseflies, as well as certain amphibians
and reptiles (tree frogs and geckos, for example), are able to walk on and

<P>"This trick is accomplished not by suction cups or adhesives but rather by a
large number of tiny bristles or hairs on the bottom surface of the animals'
feet. Scientists have produced scanning electron microscope images of these
bristles. Surfaces that appear perfectly smooth to us actually have many
microscopic bump and fissures, which serve as footholds for the tiny hairs."

<P>"The segments, or tarsi, at the end of insect legs possess clawlike
structures that help the insect hold on to different types of surfaces.
These tarsal claws are used to grip the tiny irregularities on rough
surfaces. But in some cases, insects do make use of a kind of adhesion. If
the surface is smooth, the insect can hold on using the adhesive action of
hairs located on sticky pads (known as the arolia or pulvilli) on the tarsi.

<P>"Some insects, such as grasshoppers, have pads on each of their tarsal
segments, and some insects may have special adhesive pads on other segments
of the leg. The pads typically contain numerous hairs that secrete an oily
substance that causes the tips of the hairs to adhere to the surface. This
substance provides the traction and stickiness that allows insects to hold
on to smooth surfaces, such as glass."

What do people feel in a zero-gravity environment? Does it feel like falling
endlessly, or like being on a roller coaster?

<P>Fred Best is the director of the NASA <A

university. He has spent years conducting engineering research on NASA's <A

microgravity airplane (known to some as the "Vomit Comet"). He offers this
firsthand account:

<P>"The feeling is completely different from being on a roller coaster. It is
more like motionlessness than movement. I feel great in zero gravity either
floating in place or flying through space. As long as you are in rational
control of your movements, zero gravity is the realization of a dream. A
little push sends you gliding, just like the characters in science fiction
stories. 

<P>"Beware losing your orientation, however. If your instincts take over, your
brain starts telling you, 'You're falling, reach out and catch yourself.'
Your arms and legs flail until you regain rational control and convince your
brain you are okay. 

<P>"Some background that might interest your readers: Students and I are
studying flowing fluids in zero gravity. We use the KC-135 aircraft (which was
also
used for the weightlessness scenes in the movie <I>Apollo 13</I>) as our
laboratory. Since 1986, I have made about 120 KC-135 flights, resulting in
about 5,000 'zero gravity' periods lasting 20 seconds each. I have also made
some flights which simulated lunar and Martian gravity. We last flew in May
and expect to fly again in January. We also fly simple experiments for
primary and secondary school science classes, which they analyze to
understand zero gravity effects.

<P>"Overall, zero gravity is a treat not to be missed."

heart will fly on the <A

<P>"Weightlessness is not like endlessly falling, although in reality, that is
what it is. Nor is it like a roller coaster, although being in an airplane
flying the path of a roller coaster is one way to create weightlessness for
about 20 seconds at a time. 

<P>"In weightlessness, you are effortlessly floating, because all of the
acceleration forces on you add to zero. The most comparable feeling is
floating in water without the sensation of water on your skin. Because you
feel so light, you can move about with the slightest amount of effort.
Pushing off a surface too hard, which is the common mistake of all
first-time free-floaters, results in you zinging around like a Ping-Pong
ball. Nice and easy does the trick. And there is no up or down in
weightlessness, so you need to figure out which orientation visually works
best for you. 

<P>"Peter Pan never had it so good and Michael Jordan only gets a few seconds
of hang time. In weightlessness, you have all the hang time you need."

"What kind of evidence could be found in the fossil record (or anywhere else)
that would prove whether or not some dinosaurs were warm-blooded?"</A></B></FONT>

<P>-<I>Joe Pinson<BR>Fort Mill, South Carolina</I>
        
<P><A HREF="http://www.aps.edu/htmlpages/TomW.html">Thomas E. Williamson</A> of
<A HREF="http://www.aps.edu/htmlpages/NMMNH.html">the New
Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science</A> is studying dinosaur fossils to
answer this question. Here is his response:

<P>"As yet, there is probably no evidence that would definitively prove whether
or not some dinosaurs were warm-blooded. Scientists have explored numerous
lines of evidence to try to answer this question. 

<P>"There is a clear difference in bone structure between modern cold-blooded
and warm-blooded animals. Warm-blooded animals tend to have highly
vascularized bone tissue. Cold-blooded animals, on the other hand, have
relatively dense bone, sometimes even showing annual growth rings. Dinosaurs
tend to have highly vascularized bone early in life and then develop dense
bone with growth rings as they reach maturity. New evidence suggests that
the different bone types are more related to growth rates than to warm- or
cold-bloodedness.

<P>"In modern animal communities, there are far fewer warm-blooded predators
relative to prey than cold-blooded predators. This is because warm-blooded
animals tend to eat far more than cold-blooded animals and so a given amount
of prey will support far fewer warm-blooded predators. Unfortunately, it is
very difficult to determine the actual relative abundance of predator versus
prey from the fossils because the fossil record does not always preserve an
accurate representation of the original animal community. 

<P>"Dinosaurs were able to survive even at high latitudes. For example,
dinosaur fossils have been found in Alaska and Canada well above the Arctic
Circle. During the time that these animals lived, however, the climate was
generally much warmer than today's. It is also possible that these animals
migrated into these areas during the warm summer months and retreated to
lower latitudes ahead of the cold and long polar nights. 

<P>"Modern warm-blooded animals tend to have more erect postures than
cold-blooded animals. Most dinosaurs have erect postures and therefore it
has been suggested that this indicates that they had high activity levels
and were warm-blooded. Along these lines, scientists have looked indirectly
at the potential blood pressures of dinosaurs; warm-blooded animals tend to
have relatively high blood pressures. Blood pressure can be estimated by
looking at the vertical distance between the head and the heart. For some
<A
HREF="http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/diapsids/saurischia/sauropoda.html">sauropod</A>
dinosaurs, this estimated blood pressure is very high indeed. Brachiosaurus
would have a blood pressure of about 500 millimeters of mercury. This figure
is about five times higher than that of a human. On the other hand, other
dinosaurs--such as <A
HREF="http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/diapsids/ornithischia/ceratopsia.html">ceratopsians</A>--would
have a very low blood pressure, closer to that of living reptiles, based on
this analysis. 

<P>"Modern warm-blooded animals have relatively larger brains than living
cold-blooded animals. It is thought that large brains are needed to
coordinate active, highly energetic animals. Most dinosaurs have very small
brains relative to their body size. In fact, their brains closely resemble
those of modern reptiles. A few small, predatory dinosaurs have relative
brain sizes that are comparable with those of some living birds, such as
ostriches, however. 

<P>"There is evidence from dinosaur trackways, mass accumulations of certain
dinosaur fossils, and nesting sites that dinosaurs were social animals. Some
have argued that such sophisticated behavior is suggestive of
warm-bloodedness. 

<P>"Birds are warm-blooded and probably evolved from a group of meat-eating
dinosaurs. Therefore, it has been argued, their dinosaur ancestors were also
warm-blooded. But recent study of the bone structure of some of the earliest
birds has revealed that it resembles that of modern cold-blooded reptiles,
suggesting that the first birds were cold-blooded and that warm-bloodedness
developed later. 

<P>"More recently, some researchers have looked for respiratory turbinates in
the nasal passages of dinosaurs. Respiratory turbinates are fine,
scroll-shaped bones found in the noses of most modern warm-blooded animals
(mammals and birds). These structures are believed to function as
moisture-recovery organs, recapturing water from warm and moist exhaled air.
Without these structures, many warm-blooded animals would quickly dehydrate,
especially in dry climates. So far, no respiratory turbinate structures have
been found in dinosaurs. It has been argued, however, that many dinosaurs
lived in warm and moist environments where water conservation may not have
been important. 

<P>"Dinosaurs were a very long-lived and diverse group of animals. There is as
yet no widely accepted definitive answer as to whether or not they were
warm-blooded. It is quite possible that dinosaurs had a metabolism that is
different from that of living animals. Indeed, the large size attained by
many dinosaurs may have led to what has been called 'inertial homeothermy'
or 'gigantothermy.' That is, the large bulk of the animals would have
allowed them to maintain a fairly constant temperature even without a high
metabolism. Certainly, dinosaurs were active and, in some cases, social
animals that successfully competed with warm-blooded mammals during their
160-million-year-long reign on the earth."

<P>Gregory S. Paul, a noted dinosaur researcher and illustrator, adds his
perspective:

<P>"It is not yet known whether there will ever be 'definitive proof' of the
metabolic status of dinosaurs. At this time, researchers must use multiple
lines of evidence to infer dinosaur energetics. Also, the physiological
alternatives are themselves complex, and cannot be adequately described by
simple terms such as warm or cold blooded. Some or all dinosaurs may have
had high aerobic exercise capacity like birds and mammals (tachyaerobic), or
low aerobic exercise capacity like reptiles (bradyaerobic). Dinosaurs may
have had high resting metabolic rates like birds and mammals, or low resting
rates like reptiles. How well dinosaurs could thermoregulate and control
body temperature is yet another unanswered question. 

<P>"Large hips suggest that most dinosaurs had large, aerobically capable leg
muscles like those of big-hipped birds and mammals, rather than small leg
muscles like those of bradyaerobic reptiles. Many dinosaur trackways show
that dinosaurs walked as fast as do birds and mammals, and much more rapidly
than can be sustained by reptiles. Predatory dinosaurs appear to have
developed birdlike respiratory systems able to take in large amounts of
oxygen. The herbivorous ornithopod dinosaurs may have had a mammallike
diaphragm for efficient respiration. The earliest and most primitive
dinosaurs, however, had smaller hips and less advanced respiratory systems,
suggesting their aerobic capacity was lower than in other dinosaurs, birds
and mammals.

<P>"From the fossil evidence, at least some dinosaurs appear to have grown more
rapidly than any wild reptile, suggesting the juveniles were very
aerobically active and able to seek out large amounts of food. 

<P>"The great size and especially the towering height of the sauropod dinosaurs
may have required extra-high-pressure, oversized hearts that consumed much
more oxygen than is observed in reptiles. 

<P>"The evidence for resting metabolic rates is more ambiguous. Some
continental birds and mammals, for example, have poorly developed
respiratory turbinates or nasal passages no larger than those of dinosaurs
of similar size. Some birds and mammals have very high aerobic
exercise-to-resting ratios, but no tachyaerobic animal has a reptilian
resting metabolic rate. If most dinosaurs were tachyaerobic, then they
probably had high resting metabolic rates as well. 

<P>"It is even less clear whether dinosaurs thermoregulated as effectively as
do birds and mammals. Growing dinosaurs laid down rings inside their bones
more often than birds and mammals, and this hints they did not regulate body
temperature to the same degree. 

<P>"In conclusion, the evidence that most dinosaurs had high aerobic exercise
capacity like birds and mammals is very good. It is probable that their
resting metabolic rates were higher than in reptiles. It is possible that
many dinosaurs did not maintain a constant body temperature. The energetics
of dinosaurs almost certainly were not reptilian, but just how closely they
approached the avian-mammalian condition is not yet certain." 

<P>Philip N. Froelich, director of the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences
at the <A HREF="http://www.gatech.edu/">Georgia Institute of Technology</A>,
offers yet
another view:

<P>"One possibility would be to look at oxygen isotopic abundances in the
annual growth bands of teeth or bones of high latitude (and hence,
presumably, seasonally influenced) terrestrial dinosaurs. The ratio of
oxygen isotopes depends on temperature. An absence of seasonal variations in
oxygen 18--a heavy version of the common oxygen 16 atom--would strongly
suggest that the animals maintained a constant internal temperatures. 

<P>"Such a finding would not, however, constitute 'proof' that dinosaurs were
warm blooded, as there are external mechanisms that cold-blooded animals
employ to regulate body temperatures and thereby influence metabolic rates.
Proof would have to come from discovery of intact dinosaur remains in which
the soft tissue had not been replaced or altered, and from which the
biomolecules responsible for thermoregulation could be extracted, identified
and characterized. Such a proof is very, very unlikely, as it would require
an almost impossible level of preservation over 65 million years, plus the
advent of biotechnology that does not (yet) exist to elucidate the
thermoregulation biochemistry of an extinct species."

"It seems that in almost all other species, especially primates, baring one's

<P>Anthony Stocks, chairman and professor of <A

<P>"The evolution of smiles is opaque and, as with many evolutionary accounts
of social behavior, fraught with just-soism. Among human babies, however,
the 'tooth-baring' smile is associated less with friendship than with
fright--which, one might argue, is related to the tooth-baring threats of
baboons. On the other hand, a non-toothy, not-so-broad-but-open-lipped smile
is associated with pleasure in human infants. Somehow we seem to have taken
the fright-threat sort of smile and extended it to strangers as a presumably
friendly smile. Maybe it is not as innocent as it seems. 

<P>"All cultures recognize a variety of mouth gestures as indexes of inner
emotional states. As in our own culture, however, smiles come in many
varieties, not all of them interpreted as friendly."

HREF="http://www.knox.edu/knoxweb/welcomekc/facultyprofiles/mcandrew.html">Frank
McAndrew</A>, professor of psychology at Knox College in Galesburg, Ill.,
has done extensive research on facial expressions. He answers as follows:

<P>"Baring one's teeth is not always a threat. In primates, showing the teeth,
especially teeth held together, is almost always a sign of submission. The
human smile probably has evolved from that.

<P>"In the primate threat, the lips are curled back and the teeth are
apart--you are ready to bite. But if the teeth are pressed together and the
lips are relaxed, then clearly you are not prepared to do any damage. These
displays are combined with other facial features, such as what you do with
your eyes, to express a whole range of feelings. In a lot of human smiling,
it is something you do in public, but it does not reflect true 'friendly'
feelings--think of politicians smiling for photographers.
        
<P>"What is especially interesting is that you do not have to learn to do any
of this--it is preprogrammed behavior. Kids who are born blind never see
anybody smile, but they show the same kinds of smiles under the same
situations as sighted people."

"Do humans have some kind of homing instinct, possibly involving navigation
by magnetism like certain birds do? I hear that there have been experiments
to look for this ability. Were they conclusive?"</A></B></FONT>

<P>-<I>Karla Kaczorowski<BR> Saratoga, Calif.</I>

<P><A HREF="http://alamut.lifesci.ucla.edu/psychology/Faculty/Gallistel/">C.
Randy Gallistel</A>, a professor of psychology at the University of
California at Los Angeles, replies:

<P>"Researchers have conducted a number of experiments to determine whether
humans have a magnetic compass sense, but these have been inconclusive.
Expert opinion is fairly unanimous that there are no convincing indications
of such a sense in humans. On the other hand, there is good evidence that
many insects, birds and reptiles have such a sense, although it remains
unclear under which conditions they make use of it. Also, there have been
many deeply puzzling difficulties in replicating the results that document
the existence of the magnetic compass sense.

<P>"Having a magnetic compass sense is not equivalent to having a homing
instinct, because knowing which way is north does you no good if you do not
know whether you are north, south, east or west of home. Many animals,
including humans, keep track of where they are (and hence the direction to
home) by a method known as dead reckoning: as they move about, they keep
track of each individual movement, adding these up to derive their net
change in position.

<P>"Dead reckoning is no help, however, when people or animals are displaced
under conditions in which it is impossible for them to determine the speed
and direction in which they are moving. Nevertheless, many animals--most
notably homing pigeons--are able to figure out where they are even after
this kind of displacement. How they do so remains a mystery, despite much
experimental work on this problem. A recent special issue of the <A
HREF="http://130.79.79.163/Biblio/*JourExpBiol/jeb199_01.html">Journal of
Experimental Biology</A> (January 1996, Vol. 199, No. 1) is devoted to
animal navigation. It contains reviews by many of the leading researchers."

<P>Patricia Sharp, an expert in neuroanatomy at Yale University, adds a
perspective based on her studies of navigational systems in rats:

<P>"It is not yet clear exactly what kinds of unique navigational systems
humans may have. The question is difficult to sort out, because humans can
bring so many advanced, learned cognitive skills into play when solving a
navigational task. My own work involves the study of brain systems in rats
that seem to be involved in navigation. I suspect that humans have similar
systems--but at present there is no evidence to support that suspicion.

<P>"Work from my laboratory and others has revealed two basic kinds of spatial
signals thought to be critical for navigation in rats.

<P>"1) Head-direction cells: When a rat is placed in a large recording chamber
and allowed to forage for food, there are cells in some parts of the brain
that fire whenever the rat faces one particular direction. It does not
matter where the rat is in the chamber; whenever it faces in that direction,
those cells fire like crazy. Each of the head-direction cells has its own,
unique directional preference, so that the direction the rat faces at any
given moment is signaled by the firing of some particular combination of
these cells.

<P>"One might guess that these orientation cells use some sort of information
about the earth's electromagnetic field in order to keep track of direction.
The evidence suggests this is not the case, however. It turns out that if a
rat is placed in a familiar environment and the experimenter rotates the
salient environmental landmarks, the cells' preferred directions also
rotate. This finding suggests that, just like us, rats use landmarks to 'get
oriented.'

<P>"When a rat is moved from a familiar environment into an entirely new one,
each head-direction cell retains its directional preference. This, too,
makes sense intuitively. If you walk from a familiar part of town into an
unexplored neighborhood, you can keep track of your directional heading for
some time just by logging your own movements: if you were walking north when
you started out and you have not made any turns, for example, you must still
be walking north. It is possible that the head-direction cell system is
responsible for this ability, given that data have shown that these cells
use information about the animal's own turns.

<P>"2) Place cells: These neural cells are the complement of head-direction
cells. They fire whenever the rat is in a certain location, rather than a
specific direction. Studies indicate that place cells, too, use both
landmarks and path integration (a record of the animal's movements through
space) to keep track of where they are.

<P>"It is not yet clear how these two types of cells play a role in
navigation--but is seems very likely that they do."

"Why does programmed cell death, or apoptosis, occur? Does it 
take place among bacteria and fungi or only in the cells of higher
organisms?"</A></B></FONT>

<P>-<I>M.H. Umar<BR> Rotterdam, the Netherlands</I>

<P><A HREF="http://www.hhmi.org/science/neurosci/horvitz.htm">H. Robert 
Horvitz</A>, an expert on apoptosis at the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology, gives a brief response:

<P>"In short, the question of why programmed cell death occurs should be 
subdivided into two related questions: Why are cells that die by 
programmed cell death generated? and Why do these cells die instead of 
surviving?

<P>"The answer to the first of these questions depends on the cell being 
considered. For example, some cells are generated in excess and only 
those that become properly functional survive (as happens in parts of the 
nervous system). In some cases, the mechanism that generates cells that 
are needed also fortuitously generates unneeded ones as well (as happens 
in the immune system). And some cells that die are needed, but only 
transiently.

<P>"Cells die either because they are harmful or because it takes less 
energy to kill them than to maintain them. At present, programmed cell 
death--as it is described based on the morphology of apoptosis and the 
biochemistry that involves a specific family of protein-cleaving 
enzymes--has been demonstrated to occur only in animals, although it 
remains possible that bacteria, fungi and plants use similar processes to 
eliminate unwanted cells."

<P><A HREF="http://b-dna.cshl.org/admin/pubaff/SCIENCE/hengart.html">Michael 
Hengartner</A>, senior staff investigator at <A
HREF="http://b-dna.cshl.org/">Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory</A>, offered 
a more extensive investigation of the question:

<P>"Let's start with the first part of the question: Why does programmed 
cell death occur? There are several reasons: it gets rid of cells that 
are not needed, in the way or potentially dangerous to the rest of the 
organism.

<P>"Cells that are not needed may never have had a function. In other cases, 
they may have lost their function, or they may have competed and lost out 
to other cells. In some organisms, especially lower species, there are 
cells that die off very soon after they are born. There is no clear 
reason why they ever existed. These cells are probably evolutionary 
relics that were useful in the past, but no longer serve any valuable 
function. For an example of cells that lose their function, consider the 
cells in the tail of the tadpole, which become superfluous when the 
animal develops into a <A HREF="http://165.112.57.144/stuff/">frog</A>. 

<P>"An instance of cellular competition occurs in the developing human 
brain. The brain makes many more neurons than we need, probably because 
the body does not 'know' how many neurons will suffice and because wiring 
together an intricate structure such as the brain is not easy. For 
example, many neurons will fail to reach their targets--their axons may 
take a wrong turn or may terminate prematurely. These strays that fail to 
establish a proper connection will die. Death here functions as a 
built-in error-correcting mechanism.

<P>"More generally, building a complex organism like a human being is like 
creating an intricate sculpture. Cell division forms the clay, whereas 
cell death sculpts the clay into the desired form. Consider human hands, 
which start out as paddlelike structures. Fingers develop in the paddles, 
but then the cells in the tissue between the fingers must die for a 
proper hand to form.  

<P>"One of the most fascinating reasons for cell death is to get rid of 
dangerous cells, those that could be harmful to the rest of the organism. 
One might say that the cells kill themselves for the greater good. They 
could be mutants that would become cancerous--apoptosis is therefore very 
important in the formation (or nonformation) of cancer. Also, positive 
and negative selection occur among the cells of the immune system. Cells 
that recognize 'self' (that is, ones that would attack the organism's own 
cells) are instructed to die during this process. Finally, cells that are 
infected by a virus can sometimes recognize the infection and kill 
themselves before the virus has time to replicate and spread to other cells.

<P>"Programmed cell death, in the sense of suicide deliberately induced by 
the organism, certainly does occur in multicellular plants and fungi; 
whether it occurs through the same molecular mechanism as the one found 
in metazoans (multicellular animals) remains to be determined. Cell death 
is common among plants, especially among the higher plants. The xylem in 
trees, through which water rises to the leaves, consists of spaces left 
by dead cells. Cell death occurs very visibly when deciduous trees drop 
their leaves in the fall. (Incidentally, this is where the name 
'apoptosis' comes from: it is the Greek word for the falling of leaves 
from trees, as well as the losing of hair from balding men--which 
incidentally is also thought to involve apoptosis!) Plant cells cannot 
move, so plants use a slash-and-burn technique to cope with infection: 
all the cells in an infected area may kill themselves to halt the spread 
of the disease.  

<P>"Is there programmed cell death among single-celled organisms? The answer 
gets caught up in a question of semantics between a cell choosing to die 
and being forced to die. But some forms of programmed death are found in 
unicellular organisms, including bacteria. The death of the mother cell 
during sporulation, the process in which spores are created, could be 
considered a kind of programmed cell death. Certain parasites, such as <A
HREF="http://martin.parasitology.mcgill.ca/jimspage/biol/trypan.htm">trypanosomes</A>
(which cause <A
HREF="http://www.who.ch/programmes/ctd/diseases/mala/malamain.htm">malaria</A>),
change form to elude the immune response from their host; the laggards who
 o fail to undergo the change will die off in a kind of cellular altruism.

<P>"Another parallel example occurs among <A
HREF="http://ucmp1.berkeley.edu/protista/slimemolds/slimemolds.html">slime
molds</A>, such as <A HREF="http://worms.cmb.nwu.edu/dicty.html">Dictyostelium
discoideum</A>, a species at the interface between unicellular and multicellular
organisms. These animals spend most of their lives as unicellular amoebae. But,
when starved, the cells aggregate and meld into a single 'slug' that migrates and
eventually forms a funguslike structure, consisting of a stalk topped by a ball
of spores. The spores disperse in search of a more hospitable environment. The
stalk cells do not reproduce, so in a sense they sacrifice themselves. In most
single-celled organisms (particularly bacteria), it is not clear whether cell
death follows the same pattern or biomolecular mechanisms as the apoptosis that
occurs in higher organisms.

<P>"One highly unusual form of cell death occurs in cells infected by 
certain plasmid viruses that instruct the host cell to create two 
chemicals: a long-lived toxin and an unstable antidote. During 
replication, about 1 percent of the cells lose the parasitic plasmid in 
their DNA; the daughter cells still contain the toxin but can no longer 
manufacture the antidote, so they die. This is a rare instance of 
cellular murder rather than suicide."

<P>A simple example may help to illustrate this difference between

me to deduce the exact route he followed in getting there from Troy, NY.
From the time of my last encounter with him I can guess whether he

<P>"We are in a similar predicament with our understanding of the origin
of life. Since we don't have detailed information on the exact steps we

holds that the first life on earth was based on ribonucleic acids (RNA),
a simpler chemical cousin of DNA. Many researchers have focused on RNA
because it can store genetic information and it can catalyze reactions;
these are essential processes in living systems. In this scenario, it is
proposed that RNA, a polymer (long-chain molecule), arose from the
gradual stringing together of repeating chemical units, known as
monomers, that naturally arose on the primitive earth.

<P>"Recently it has been shown that it is possible to form RNA from
monomers on the surfaces of clays, which can catalyze, or chemically
assist, the polymerization reaction. Experiments done in test tubes (in

evolve to an RNA with different catalytic properties. These two sets of
experiments suggest that it may be possible to demonstrate how clay
minerals could have permitted the formation of complex RNA molecules
that are capable of evolving in form. If this inference is correct, then
the research provides support for a plausible scenario for the origins
of life. But, as with the question concerning the route my friend took
from Troy to San Diego, we will never know for sure. Just as my friend
may have reached San Diego by flying east to Europe and Japan, life may
have evolved by an equally circuitous route."

"Most unbred animals (English sparrows, for example) all look alike to
me. People, of course, not so. Do I just not recognize the traits that
distinguish one animal from another, or do they really lack the
individual distinctiveness of humans?" </A></B></FONT>

<P>-<I>Ed Martin<BR>Buffalo, New York</I>

<P>James R. Northern of the Moore Laboratory of Zoology at Occidental
College in Los Angeles, California, noted the following:

<P>"If you were to take a group of people and shrink them down to the
size of an English Sparrow, they would loose much of the individual
characters that you use for recognition of individuals. The distinctive
characters would still be there, but much harder to see, since they
would be smaller.

<P>"Birds recognize each other by their voices or calls. They can
identify mates, parents or offspring by voice, much as a blind person
might do. During courtship and pair formation, birds learn to recognize
their mate by 'voice' characteristics, and not by visual appearance."

<P>Pamela J. Pietz of the <A HREF="http://www.npsc.nbs.gov/">Northern
Prairie Science Center</A> in Jamestown, North Dakota, considered two
parts of the question--how do we tell animals apart, and how do they
distinguish each other. Her reply follows:

<P>"Humans can tell individual animals apart in many species, but it
takes some familiarity with the species of interest. For example,
researchers can recognize individual humpback whales because each whale
has a unique black-and-white pattern on the underside of its tail
flukes. Biologists studying great right whales (such as <A
HREF="http://whales.prodigy.com/paynebio.htm">Roger Payne</A> in
Argentine Patagonia) recognize individuals by the unique patterns of
whitish growths, called callosities, on the whales' heads.

<P>"<A HREF="http://biosci.cbs.umn.edu/eeb/faculty/PackerCraig.html">Craig
Packer</A> and <A
HREF="http://biosci.cbs.umn.edu/eeb/faculty/PuseyAnne.html">Anne
Pusey</A> of the University of Minnesota use whisker patterns to tell
individual lions apart in their African research. For short-term
identification, some researchers use scarred skin, missing feathers or
other physical anomalies to tell animals apart. Researchers record tears
and notches that they observe on the edges of elephants' ears to
distinguish African elephants from one another, for instance.

<P>"The common aspect of all these recognition systems is that the
people who devised them spent lots of time looking closely at lots of
individuals of one species. It is likely that we could recognize
individuals of many species if we spent enough time observing them
carefully. Of course, individuals of some species <I>do</I> look more
alike than individuals of some other species. For example, some
invertebrates have reproductive systems that lead to many individuals
being very closely related to each other genetically (much like
identical twins in humans). The less genetic variability there is among
individuals of a species, the more closely they will resemble one
another.

<P>"We should also remember that visual markers are not the only
possible way to tell individuals apart. Humans tend to rely on visual
cues more than other types of cues because our vision is more highly
developed than our other senses.

<P>"Individual animals of a given species probably can tell one another
apart as easily as we can tell humans apart, but they may use sound,
smell, and other senses instead of, or in addition to, vision. Birds are
strongly visually oriented (that's why they are so colorful), so they
may use visual cues to recognize individuals; they also have excellent
hearing, however, so they may respond to differences in individual
voices as well, much as humans do. Reptiles use chemical signs (akin to
'smell') to gather information about their environment, so they probably
likewise rely on chemical signs to tell individuals apart. Some animals
see beyond the visible light spectrum (bees and some birds see
ultraviolet wave lengths), and some animals hear sounds that are too low
(e.g., elephants) or too high (e.g., dogs) for humans to hear. Thus,
some animals may use cues to tell each other apart that are not
available to us."

<P>-<I>Jim Daly<BR> Sayre, Pennsylvania</I>

<P>Robert Ehrlich, a physicist at George Mason University, sent in the
following reply:

<P>"As in the movie '2001,' the space station would presumably be in the
shape of a giant spinning torus or doughnut, with gravity pointing
outward from the spin axis, so that your head would point towards the
central axis.

<P>"The strength of gravity would depend on the rate of spin. If the
station had a diameter of 640 meters, it would need to rotate about once
per minute to simulate the Earth's gravity. Only if the space station
had a fairly small diameter would simulated gravity feel any different
from the real thing. For small diameters, the strength of gravity would
vary at different points of your body depending on their distance from
the axis of rotation, with the result that you would be slightly
stretched. For example, if the radius of the space station were only 20
meters (about 10 times your height), gravity would be 10 percent
stronger on your feet than your head when you were standing upright. For
a 150-pound person, it would feel like a 15-pound force were stretching
you.

<P>"The main problem regarding feasibility today would be the difficulty
of constructing a large space station that had sufficient structural
strength to remain intact under the simulated gravity."

<P>John Taylor of <A HREF="http://www.msfc.nasa.gov/HOME.html">NASA's
Marshall Space Flight Center</A> in Huntsville , Alabama, explains why
nobody is racing to exploit artificial gravity just yet:

<P>"We go to space to get away from the Earth's gravity; we have no
incentive to try to create it artificially.

<P>"The <A HREF="http://issa-www.jsc.nasa.gov/">international Space
Station</A> is above all a human physiology research facility. Before we
can ever hope to explore the solar system, we first need to know what
effects long-term exposure to the hostile space environment will have on
the human body. We already know that in the absence of gravity we see <A
HREF="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/Noordung/noord28.html">rapid
changes</A> in such things as bone mass and muscle mass. Radiation poses
unknown hazards as well.

<P>"Aboard the Space Station scientists will try to sort out the attacks
and possible countermeasures. They will also carry out important
microgravity research. Both the physiology (life sciences) and <A
HREF="http://microgravity.msad.hq.nasa.gov/">microgravity</A>
(biotechnology, materials etc.) research depend on the <I>absence</I> of
gravity. Any attempt at artificial gravity would turn Space Station into
little more than an observation platform.

<P>"Once we have the answers we seek, we may find that it would be
beneficial to use artificial gravity for long-term travel in space. Or
maybe not. If we do want to try this for some reason, it could be
achieved by having two Space Station-sized modules attached end-to-end
to a central node or core. These could be rotated around the core. Or,
you could simply swing a pair of modules on opposite ends of a long
tether, with nothing in the middle. Right now, creating artificial
gravity is not very high on anybody's priority list, so not much effort
is going into this kind of engineering. But we do know how to do it, at
least in principle."

"What kind of illnesses do insects get? Do we have the medical knowledge

<P>-<I>Bernard S. Husbands<BR> Camano Island, WA</I>

<P><A
HREF="http://www.bchs.uh.edu/Department/Faculty/BIOL/Kimbrell/Kimbrell.html">Deborah
A. Kimbrell</A>, an assistant professor of biology at the University of
Houston, responds:

<P>"Bacteria and viruses can be problems for insects; some insects also
face threats from parasitic wasps or other parasites. Insects, however,
have very effective immune systems for fighting illness. For instance,
when bacteria entering through a wound, insect blood cells are quickly
mobilized to surround and digest (phagocytose) the invading bacteria. At
the same time, the fat body--a tissue analogous to the mammalian
liver--produces large quantities of antibacterial proteins. This immune
response of insects is very similar to that in mammals, and in recent
years scientists have studied the common fruitfly, <I>Drosophila
melanogaster</I>, to learn about fundamentals of immunity in both
insects and mammals.

<P>"As for curing a sick insect, they could be treated with antibiotics
just as we are. In principle, gene therapy could be used to treat some
insect illnesses that have a genetic basis, rather than being caused by
an infection. A fruit fly (or any kind of insect) might suffer mutations
in certain critical genes--tumor suppressor genes, for example. If
tumors developed as the result of the mutation, then one could add a
normal copy of that gene to the fly, or at least to its progenitors.
Such gene therapy could stop the formation of tumors.

<P>"These answers derive not from specific work on treating sick
insects, but rather from basic research on infectious disease, gene
transfer and molecular genetics. In reality, most studies have focused
on getting rid of insects that are pests, especially for agriculture.
Nonetheless, a complete answer to your two questions would also tell us
a great deal about our own illnesses and methods for cures as well as
understanding insects."

"Over the years, I have come to believe that someone's fundamental

<P>-<I>Richard Johnson<BR> Cupertino, California</I>

<P>Paul Grobstein, an expert in biology and behavioral science at Bryn
Mawr College, starts by cautioning that "'consensus within the
scientific community' is not anywhere near as important as the actual
set of scientific observations that exists at any given time (which may
or may not yield a consensus among scientists), and the understanding
that that set is constantly growing (which is likely to change any
consensus that exists).

<P>"With regard to the immediate question, there is certainly a large
set of observations which indicate that genes influence personality.
And, given the availability of new molecular techniques, one ought to
expect substantially more observations of this kind in the years to
come. In the face of that, what needs to be kept in mind is that the
observations show that genes <I>influence</I> personality. They do not,
and cannot show that genes <I>determine</I> personality. Even many
scientists tend to confuse the two sorts of conclusions, presuming that
an observation showing something to be influenced by one thing
necessarily implies that other things are irrelevant. This is simply not
the case. In general, biological phenomena are influenced simultaneously
and to varying degrees by a <A
HREF="http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/pgrobste/hth.html">variety of
factors</A>, and there is abundant reason (both in principle and in
terms of additional observations) to believe that this is true for
personality.

<P>"If one started with a belief that personality is totally a function
of environmental influences--as many people do--then one has some useful
and appropriate things to learn from the growing evidence for genetic
influences. Genes do influence personality, as they do <A
HREF="http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/Letter-NYtimes.html">intelligence</A>
and every other aspect of being human. What they don't do, for
personality or any other aspect of being human, is to <A

it</A>.

<P>"Not only environmental influences but also <A

dreams</A> and <A

demonstrably play a role as well. Wisdom is to be found not in the
latest scientific observations, nor in the most visible ones at any
given time, but rather than in their totality...and in a recognition of
the complex web of causal interactions and personal responsibilities
which that implies.
