<H2><B>MARITIME CONFIDENCE-BUILDING MEASURES IN THE MIDDLE EAST
</B></H2>

<P>
<B>Mr. Peter JONES</B>
<P>
Regional Security Officer, Non-Proliferation, Arms Control and
Disarmament Division, Canadian Department of Foreign Affairs and
International Trade<HR>

<P>
The political context of the Middle East Maritime Confidence-Building
Measures(MCBM) discussions arises from the so-called Madrid Formula
of the Middle East Peace Process (MEPP). The Madrid Formula, established
during the ground-breaking Madrid Middle East Peace Conference,
created a two-track MEPP under the over-all sponsorship of the
United States and Russia.
<P>
The first track was devoted to a series of bilateral negotiations
between the participants in the Peace Process. The second called
for the creation of a series of multilateral working groups on
various issues germane to the creation of a Middle East at peace.
It was recognized from the beginning that the bilateral track
was the more important, and that the progress in the multilaterals
would ultimately depend on the progress in the bilaterals.
<P>
These multilateral groups would include all of the Middle East
participants in the MEPP and several states outside the region
which had demonstrated a willingness to become involved in the
search for a settlement to the Middle East dispute and were able
to contribute to the process. The five multilateral groups established
in Moscow in January 1992 were: the Arms Control and Regional
Security Working Group (ACRSWG); Water Resources; Environment;
Regional Economic Development; and Refugees.
<P>
What I have to say relates to the ACRSWG. After initial meetings
of an exploratory nature in both Moscow and Washington, the Middle
East participants were asked to submit views on specific topics
they would be
<P>
willing to discuss. Eventually, six topics were agreed, one of
which was MCBMs.
<P>
MCBMs were seen as a potentially productive topic because, of
all the spheres of military rivalry in the Middle East, the maritime
sphere is generally regarded as the least contentious, <U>initself.
</U> Though naval forces are firmly caught up in the various military
disputes of a purely maritime or naval character. Thus, it was
reasoned that it might be easier for concrete steps to be taken
in the maritime sphere at the beginning of the ACRSWG process.
It was thus agreed at the third ACRSWG Plenary in Washington that
an examination of MCBMs could begin.
<P>
Canada is a firm supporter of the MEPP and a consistent contributor
to peacekeeping forces in the region. We also enjoy good relations
with all countries in the region. Finally, Canada possesses both
a highly professional and respected Navy and Coast Guard with
the requisite expertise to contribute substantively. For all of
these reasons, Canada was asked to serve as Mentor (we prefer
the term Facilitator) of the ACRSWG examination of the applicability
of MCBMs in the Middle East.
<P>
After consultations, Canada proposed that initial considerations
should center on two specific MCBMs; enhanced regional cooperation
in maritime Search and Rescue (SAR); and the elaboration of the
basic framework of a regional Prevention of Incidents at Sea (INCSEA)
Agreement. These two were selected because they represent areas
where work could go forward towards practical and political useful
agreements on relatively uncontentious issues. Search and Rescue
is first and foremost a humanitarian activity and no state wants
to see an unplanned incident escalate into a tense situation.
Also, both areas require naval officers to work cooperatively
towards the establishment and realization of agreed goals.
<P>
With agreement to make SAR and INCSEA the focus of consideration,
the task was to identify ways of getting the regional parties
together to explore these issues. After consulting with the co-sponsors,
Canada proposed a Workshop on these two issues. It was further
proposed that this workshop take place on neutral ground, at the
Canadian Coast Guard College in Sydney, Nova Scotia in September,
1993. It was also decided that the Workshop would not seek to
explore the basic concepts in play in a generic fashion.
<P>
Accordingly, Canada, in cooperation with the two co-sponsors,
developed a program for the Sydney Workshop which emphasized practical,
hands-on examination of both SAR and INCSEA concepts. The participants
were broken into small, mixed nationality groups and each group
was given specific tasks in terms of both SAR and INCSEA. These
tasks concentrated on solving generic problems with the concepts
in play. Though all have SAR capabilities, cooperation in this
field is not yet a common feature in the region. INCSEA, meanwhile,
is entirely new to the navies of the region.
<P>
The INCSEA scenarios were intended to demonstrate that early communication
of intentions between ships is the best means of avoiding misunderstandings,
and that the ready availability of a group of specially tailored
signals can be a factor in preventing a benign misunderstanding
from becoming a potential source of conflict. Discussions at Sydney
amongst the participants, demonstrated the importance of timely
and thorough consultations.
<P>
The SAR discussions focused on the effectiveness of pooling resources
to deal with humanitarian emergencies. In addition, the technical
requirements of such pooling were identified. At the lower end
of the scale of complexity these were seen to be communications
capabilities which would cut across regional and political boundaries.
Moving higher on the scale, participants identified the need to
familiarize each other with their procedures, training and equipment,
and ultimately to standardize these on regional or sub-regional
basis. The SAR discussions also looked at existing
<P>
arrangements for international SAR cooperation and examined their
potential applicability to the Middle East.
<P>
At the end of the Sydney Workshop it was agreed by all that neither
SAR nor INCSEA presented any insurmountable obstacles of a technical
nature. On SAR, it was agreed that a good beginning would be made
if the regional states were to exchange information on their SAR
communications frequencies and their command and control provisions
for SAR. This would enable them to contact each other quickly
in cases of emergency and to have some idea of the capabilities
which others could contribute quickly to a SAR response. On INCSEA,
the essential simplicity of the existing arrangements was endorsed,
as was endorsed, as was their emphasis on professional Navy-to-Navy
contacts.
<P>
Accordingly, the regional participants asked Canada to prepare
two things for the next Workshop. First, they wanted Canada to
prepare a questionnaire on regional SAR practices. The intention
was that the responses to this questionnaire would form the basis
of an initial exchange and discussion of information on basic
SAR capabilities and practices in the region. Second, they asked
Canada to prepare a draft multilateral INCSEA text for the Middle
East. This text would serve as the basis for an examination of
what such an agreement might look like in the Middle East. Interestingly,
this would be the very first multilateral INCSEA ever produced
as all previous Agreements had been bilateral.
<P>
Canada worked on these requests in the hope that another Workshop
would be held in the late autumn of 1993. For various reasons
(some technical, some political) it was not until March of 1994
that the next Workshop could be held in Antalya, Turkey. In the
Meantime, the results of the Sydney Workshop were endorsed by
the ACRSWG Plenary held in Moscow in November, 1993.
<P>
Discussion of SAR at Antalya was uneven. Disappointingly few of
the regional participants actually returned their SAR questionnaires.
This meant that the detailed exchange of information upon which
much of the meeting had been predicated could not take place.
The Canadian facilitators had some success in drawing information
out of the participants in discussion, but not to the extent we
had hoped.
<P>
Nevertheless, the regional participants continued their exploration
of the desirability and mechanics of enhanced regional cooperation
in SAR. They agreed that a regional communications network being
set up initially by the Dutch as another ACRSWG activity should
be used for SAR coordination. Encouragingly, a few regional states
even offered to host an eventual regional Rescue Coordination
Centre.
<P>
It is difficult to discern the exact reason for the less than
expected performance on SAR in Antalya. Much of it stems back
to the fact that very few of the regional participants filled
out the Canadian questionnaire. We do not know why this was so.
It may be that many were unwilling to provide the level of detail
requested on what is, after all, an essentially military function.
It may be something as benign as the fact that the questionnaire
simply fell between the cracks of bureaucratic responsibility
in most countries.
<P>
Whatever the reason, it seems clear that the discussions will
remain at a rather basic level for some time unless the regional
participants decide to be more forthcoming regarding their own
capabilities.
<P>
The INCSEA discussions, by contrast, made considerable progress.
Canada's draft INCSEA text was accepted as a basic framework for
the discussions. In many respects, the draft followed the existing
Canada-Russia INCSEA text. This was especially true with respect
to the obligations to be under taken by parties concerning the
avoidance of harassment. The draft differed in that its consultative
mechanisms had to reflect the need to encompass a multilateral
framework.
<P>
This is a critical change in that a substantial part of the value
of any INCSEA Agreement is the requirement to consult on safety
on a regular basis at the navy-to-navy level. That obligation
is the foundation of the face to face contact between naval professionals
which an INCSEA Agreement seeks to promote. In a multilateral
Agreement, these reviews would have to include both a regular
multilateral meeting at which all parties could discuss the operation
of the Agreement, and a regular set of interlocking bilaterals
at which individual Parties could sit down to discuss matters
of mutual concern.
<P>
The whole question of reviews is also bound up with the membership
question, which raises questions over the formal recognition by
others. Because of this problem, a lengthy discussion was held
over what form an eventual INCSEA Agreement might take. It was
pointed out that a form of document which was not legally binding
would be just as effective operationally. Others responded that
such a fix might lack certain of the political benefits sought
by some, in terms of normalizing relations between states in the
Middle East. Obviously, this is part of a larger political problem,
the solution to which will have to come through the bilateral
process.
<P>
Finally with respect to the provisional title of the draft document,
some pointed out that there is little history of naval ''incidents''
as such in the Middle East. It was also feared that the current
title sounded too provocative in the light of the desire to highlight
the cooperative nature of the proposed under taking. Therefore,
it was suggested that the title should be cast more in terms of
''facilitating the safety of navigation'' in the region.
<P>
In operational terms a number of other questions arose. For example,
language was introduced by some which sought to constrain the
use of certain technology devices when ships were in proximity
to each other. The problem with these ideas was that, in some
cases, the non-use of certain technologies may be impossible to
verify. Furthermore, the very
<P>
idea appears to change the purpose of an INCSEA Agreement, making
it into a much more operationally constraining regime than the
present one.
<P>
The principle behind existing INCSEA Agreements is that participants
will naturally refrain from activities which might endanger their
partners. It is not seen as necessary to spell everything out,
but rather to rely upon the desire of the participants to have
the Agreement succeed. Problems which arise should thus be dealt
with by the review process. Trying to define every possible case
where problems might happen, and come up with firm provisions
to prevent them, is seen as both inconsistent with the spirit
of the exercise and impossibly complex. It might also lead to
a potentially divisive negotiation over what should be restricted
and what should not. Moreover, certain possibilities inevitably
would be omitted in any such discussion and come back to haunt
the Parties later.
<P>
Obviously, this point of view is based on a premise of a certain
level of trust existing between the participants. This approach
recognizes that, even though they may have certain operational
difficulties, the navies of the participating states will recognize
their mutual interest in avoiding incidents. Examination of this
issue continues.
<P>
Another operational difference which arose concerned the question
of what are known as <U>exclusion zones</U> around ships engaged
in maneuvers. When the original INCSEA Agreement was negotiated
the then USSR sought to apply restrictions as to how close US
Navy ships could get to Soviet ships. Accordingly, they proposed
that definite distances, known as range limitations, be incorporated
into the INCSEA Agreement.
<P>
In the initial INCSEA negotiations with the USSR, the US disagreed
vehemently with this approach. It took the view that the normal
exercise of good seamanship would dictate the distance one ship
should maintain from another for safety's sake. The US Navy did
not want any restrictions placed on its freedom to get as close
to Soviet ships for surveillance purposes as circumstances would
permit. They preferred that it be left to the individual captains
concerned, recognizing that responsibility for any mistakes would
also rest with them. After intense discussion the USSR accepted
the US position as part of a final trade-off to achieve an Agreement
in 1972. At the same time, the Russians reserved the right to
raise the question again and did so in succeeding years.
<P>
At Antalya, some naval experts also sought <U>range limitations
</U>. This approach was strongly resisted by others, including
the US Navy observers to the talks. In particular, the US Navy
is concerned that a regional INCSEA Agreement which includes specific
distance requirements could set an unfortunate precedent for future
regional Agreements of this type. This is a clear example of the
needs of an extra-regional, but nevertheless heavily involved
power, having an impact upon a regional discussion.
<P>
Yet another interesting question which has arisen concerns the
eventual applicability of a Middle East INCSEA Agreement. All
current INCSEA Agreements clearly apply ''Beyond the Territorial
Seas'' of the Parties. That phrase is, in fact, in their titles.
This means that in any case of incursion by ships of one Party
into the territorial waters of another, the navy of the transgressed
Party will not be bound by the INCSEA provisions in making its
response. It may choose to exercise these provisions, but does
not have to.
<P>
Because of the geographical complexities of the Middle East, this
provision may cause problems. In the Red Sea, for example, there
is no international water. The Red Sea is so narrow that the territorial
waters of the states around it are directly joined in the Red
Sea. This being the case, actions taken by one Navy in its territorial
waters could be considered provocative to ships of another Navy
in their own territorial waters but within eyesight.
<P>
Unless the Middle East INCSEA Agreement is made to apply within
territorial waters, these situations would not fail under its
scope.
<P>
At the same time, however, the spread with which threats can develop
in the region is such that most navies are unwilling to accept
restrictions on their actions within their territorial waters.
If a naval ship discovers a small, unidentified ship speeding
through its waters under suspicious circumstances, a threat to
the coastline can develop in a matter of seconds, and the defending
ship does not want to be encumbered with the need to raise INCSEA
signal flags and wait for a reply before responding.
<P>
This problem never arose in the negotiations over the original
INCSEA Agreements. In those cases, the participants were all ''Blue
Water'' navies with Blue Water problems. The Middle East is different
and points the way to difficulties which might be expected in
applying such an Agreement to other regional contexts where the
intended participants are primarily coastal defense navies.
<P>
The regional participants left Antalya promising to engage in
further study and discussion of the question. Suggestions have
ranged from leaving it to Parties to informally exercise the provisions
of the Agreement in territorial waters where circumstances warrant,
to establishing special provisions for use within territorial
waters.
<P>
Finally, some states raised concerns that proposals requiring
surface ships operating with submerged submarines to display certain
signals, might jeopardize the secrecy of submarine operations.
This argument was a constant factor in the original US-USSR INCSEA
negotiations. The US was vehemently opposed to any restrictions
on submarine operations. After discussion, however, it was decided
that this provision is essentially a safety one and is aimed not
at submarines, but at surface ships which might be operating with
them. Within the Middle East discussions, consideration of this
subject continues.
<P>
These are the main issues of consideration. It is important to
note that they comprise a minority of the original Canadian draft
text. Over 70% of that draft has been tentatively accepted as
a valid framework for an eventual Agreement by the regional participants
after in-depth discussion and some modifications. We expect to
continue our examination of the text at another meeting this autumn.
<P>
In the meantime, Canada has been asked to prepare two events this
summer in support of the Middle East SAR and INCSEA discussions.
The first will be a practical demonstration of both SAR and INCSEA
concepts involving Canadian and American warships currently on
station in the Mediterranean. The second will be a Workshop for
senior naval officers From the Middle East, which we hope will
take place at the end of the summer in Canada. Both of these proposals
were endorsed by the most recent ACRSWG Plenary in Doha, Qatar
in April.
<P>
Canada hopes that these events will enable us to make progress
on both INCSEA and SAR at the next working level meetings devoted
to this subject in the autumn.

Abstract
<P>
The 1972 Navy-to-Navy U.S.-Soviet Incidents at Sea (INCSEA) Agreement
was a product of the Cold War and a landmark in tension-reduction
as well as confidence-building measure between the major power
navies. Establishing special rules to minimize ship maneuvers
that create dangers of collisions, to prohibit actions (simulated
attacks, etc.) that might be interpreted as hostile or harassment,
and to establish special communications procedures, the U.S.-Soviet
INCSEA Agreement has been remarkably successful in minimizing
incidents between the two navies -- despite their more frequent
global interaction in the two decades since the agreement, the
1972 agreements have also served as a model for more recent similar
bilateral INCSEA agreements, as well as for the broader 1989 U.S.-Soviet
military leaders' agreement on prevention of Dangerous Military
Activities(DMA). However, the &quot;highseas&quot; coverage limits
of the INCSEA Agreement do not address boundaries and operations
in territorial waters, nor do the INCSEA provisions cover the
inherently stealthy submerged submarine -- and the lack of INCSEA
procedures to avoid U.S.-Soviet incidents in areas of ongoing
conflict (such as the Persian Gulf during the Iran-Iraq War) was
only remedied in the 1989 DMA Agreement.
<P>
The experience of the 1972 US-Soviet Incidents at Sea Agreement
(and the 1989 US-Soviet Dangerous Military Activities Agreement)
suggests several supplementary approaches to minimize incidents
at sea in the post-Cold War world. Existing and additional bilateral
agreements still provide a sound technical and political basis
to reduce special bilateral incidents at sea. There may be benefit
in certain specific regions to a regional &quot;Safety at Sea'
approach which broadens these provisions through a regional agreement
addressing also non-naval (fishing and merchant) shipping and
including regional territorial waters (as well as the high seas).
Additionally, the time-tested provisions of the US-Soviet bilateral
INCSEA Agreement requiring naval forces on the high seas to communicate
and avoid dangerous maneuvers and harassment might be incorporated
into a multilateral agreement open to all nations. It is significant
to note that these bilateral, regional, and multilateral approaches
are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Nor can they deal with
the problems of inherently covert submerged submarines, law of
the sea disputes over boundaries of territorial seas (and Exclusive
Economic Zones) and the danger of incidents in waters adjacent
to an ongoing conflict. A flexible variety of bilateral and multilateral
actions is needed to minimize these latter more difficult causes
of incidents at sea. These include continuing appropriate bilateral
and multilateral negotiations on agreed interpretations of law
of the sea boundaries, (and perhaps provisions for submarine underwater
communications in extreme situations of perceived close danger),
and agreements for special designation and appropriate communication
of ships and aircraft in dangerous zones of ongoing conflict.
A proper complementary mix of these suggested actions can help
further reduce global incidents at sea in the post-Cold War world.
<P>
The 1972 U.S.-Soviet Incidents at Sea (INCSEA) Agreement was a
product of the Cold War and a landmark tension-reduction and confidence-building
measure between major power navies. The success of the U.S.-Soviet
INCSEA agreement over a period of two decades has inspired similar
bilateral agreements and proposals for even more ambitious multilateral
agreements. In 1989, the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. reached a broader
military agreement on prevention of Dangerous Military Activities
(DMA), which owed much to the experience of the INCSEA agreement.
Using the U.S. as a benchmark, this analysis will examine the
nature of incidents at sea, the historical background and reasons
for success of the U.S.-Soviet INCSEA agreement, and consider
the implications for maritime security of this and similar INCSEA
agreements in the post-Cold War security environment.
<H4>1<B>. Incidents at Sea-Variations on a Dangerous Theme</B>
</H4>

<P>
There is a variety of potentially dangerous interactions between
ships or between ships and aircraft that may be categorized as
&quot;incidents at sea.&quot; Perhaps the most common are maneuvers
by ships which create dangers of collisions. These maneuvers may
be intentional violations of the recognized &quot;International
Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea,&quot; for example
by a ship maneuvering without signal or in violation of the right
of way provisions of these agreements. Often equally dangerous
are maneuvers in violation of the spirit of these agreements,
as when a ship having right of way proceeds to the point of causing
a danger of collision. Maneuvering in front of aircraft carriers
or other ships launching aircraft, or maneuvering in front of
ships conducting underway replenishment are particularly dangerous
maneuvers. These maneuvers in turn have sometimes given rise to
dangerous attempts to shoulder or block off the offending ship
by the ships whose operations were challenged or disrupted.
<P>
Other common incidents have included simulated attacks by aiming
weapons or fire control radar systems at opposing ships, training
searchlights on bridges of opposing ships (thereby blinding the
crews at night), firing or dropping flares from aircraft in close
proximity to ships, 'buzzing' of ships by low overflight by aircraft,
and even accidental firing on ships during naval exercises.
<P>
The results of the various categories of incidents noted above
may vary, but their implications are serious. Perhaps most common
is a &quot;close call&quot; where no actual contact or damage
between ships or ships and aircraft results. On numerous occasions,
however, dangerous maneuvers have resulted in collisions between
ships. These collisions have sometimes resulted in loss of life
and damage to valuable equipment. Simulated attacks and other
harassment could, in times of tension or crisis, have resulted
in an action-reaction cycle of escalation to hostilities at sea
or even a deliberate preemptive attack. Although the U.S. and
Soviet navies fortunately avoided such hostilities on the high
seas during the tense Cold War era, past and recent history offers
numerous examples where at least local hostilities resulted from
&quot;incidents at sea.&quot; &quot;Incidents at sea&quot; with
the British Royal Navy were largely responsible for the U.S. involvement
in the War of 1812, and a century later German submarine attacks
helped lead to the U.S. involvement in both World Wars. In the
Dogger Bank incident of 1904, Russian attacks by mistake on British
trawlers nearly precipitated a war. More recently, naval incidents
in or over the Gulf of Sidra (in 1981, 1986 and 1989) and in the
Persian Gulf (1987-1988) led to U.S. clashes with Libyan and Iranian
naval forces (as well as the Iraqi EXOCET missile attack &quot;By
Mistake&quot; on the U.S. frigate Stark in the Persian Gulf in
1987). Disputes over oil exploration activities by ships in disputed
territorial seas brought Greece and Turkey to the brink of war
in March 1987. Disputed territorial waters and rival claims to
islands led to clashes between the navies of Vietnam and the PRC
in the Spratlies Islands in the South China Sea as recently as
March 1988. The possible implications of these historical examples
of incidents at sea are mixed. As we shall see below in the case
of the U.S. and Soviet navies in the Cold War era, an agreement
to avoid incidents at sea greatly reduced the frequency of such
incidents and thus contributed to the avoidance of hostilities.
However, as other examples above suggest, disputes between nations
over territorial waters, and the presence of even neutral naval
forces in waters when a conflict is ongoing, are two circumstances
that have frequently led to naval hostilities that in origin and
extent go beyond simple &quot;incidents at sea.&quot;
<H4><B>2. The 1972 US-USSR Agreement on the Prevention of Incidents
at Sea</B></H4>

<P>
a) Historical Background
<P>
U.S.-Soviet incidents at sea were relatively limited for the first
twenty years after 1945, largely because the Soviet navy did not
begin to appear as a global open-ocean challenge to the U.S. Navy
until the mid- to late-1960s. In the 1940s and 1950s, the few
ship incidents occurred in the Baltic Sea and the Sea of Japan--which
were also areas where the U.S.S.R. shot down U.S. reconnaissance
aircraft. Perhaps the most dangerous incidents during this period
involved U.S. naval forces pressing Soviet submarines to surface
during the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.
<P>
After the Cuban Missile Crisis--and arguably because of the effectiveness
of U.S. naval power in that crisis--the U.S.S.R. dedicated its
resources to developing an open ocean navy capable of challenging
U.S. naval power on a global basis. By the latter half of the
1960s, Soviet naval forces were permanently deployed in the Mediterranean
and routinely trailing U.S. aircraft carriers in action off Vietnam.
In 1965 and 1966, official U.S. papers recorded 24 and 33 significant
incidents at sea with the Soviets.&quot;
<P>
The U.S. public and leadership became aware of the fact that the
U.S.-Soviet tensions at sea when the U.S. destroyer Walker, operating
with an anti-submarine task force in the Sea of Japan, collided
with a Soviet destroyer on May 10, 1967, and with another Soviet
ship the next day. This resulted in two U.S. diplomatic protests
to the Soviets, a call by the then-Minority Leader of the U.S.
House of Representatives Gerald Ford for the U.S. Navy authorization
to fire on intruding Soviet ships, and a statement of concern
by President Johnson. During the Arab-Israeli Six-Day War in June
1967, Soviet warships interfered with the operations of the U.S.
aircraft carrier America. After the North Korean seizure of the
U.S.S. Pueblo in January 1968, the U.S. Navy cited Russian ships
for a dozen violations of collision regulations in the Sea of
Japan, and a Soviet merchant ship and U.S. destroyer collided.
<P>
b) Negotiating the U.S.-Soviet INCSEA Agreement
<P>
The increasing frequency, publicity, and seriousness of these
U.S.-Soviet incidents at sea throughout 1967 and 1968 led to a
formal U.S. proposal to the Soviets on April 16, 1968 for &quot;Safety
at Sea&quot; discussions. The Soviets ignored the U.S. proposal
for two years. In August 1970, the U.S. protested other Soviet
ship actions, and repeated the offer of negotiation. In the Mediterranean
during the Jordanian crisis of September 1970, U.S. and Soviet
fleets were in further close contact, and the next month a U.S.
general and his aircraft were seized when accidentally landing
in Armenia. On November 10, 1970, immediately following a collision
between the British aircraft carrier Ark Royal and a Soviet destroyer,
in which Soviet sailors were killed, a Soviet diplomat in Moscow
agreed to the U.S. proposal for bilateral diplomatic meetings
on safety at sea. It is likely that both the cumulative effect
of the increasingly serious U.S.-Soviet confrontations at sea,
and the broader turn in the atmosphere of U.S.-Soviet relations
toward detente which was apparent by late 1970 influenced Soviet
willingness to address the problem of incidents at sea. Undoubtedly,
Soviet naval officers also appreciated the implied recognition
of the Soviet Navy as a global naval power, and perhaps the increased
standing this provided in the Soviet military bureaucracy.
<P>
After intensive interagency preparations in Washington and U.S.
consultations with Allies, the formal negotiation of the INCSEA
Agreement began with the arrival of a U.S. delegation in Moscow
on October 12, 1971. Significantly, the negotiations were led
by then Under-Secretary of the Navy John Warner and U.S. naval
officers, meeting with their Soviet Navy counterparts and diplomats
from both sides. The Soviet Navy proudly hailed the U.S. team
as &quot;the highest-ranking military delegation to arrive in
Moscow since the Second World War. The U.S. concern in these negotiations
centered on elaborating on the Collision Regulations to prevent
dangerous maneuvers by Soviet ships, particularly those that harassed
and disrupted aircraft carrier flight operations. To the relief
of the U.S. delegation, the Soviets readily agreed to exclude
from the agreement any mention of the inherently covert submarines
of both sides. The Soviets were particularly concerned about the
U.S. aircraft overflights for reconnaissance and dropping of sonobuoys
in the water, and wanted &quot;fixed distances&quot; for minimum
ship-to-ship and aircraft-to-ship approach. The U.S., desire to
maintain operational commanders' flexibility for close approach
for identification and intelligence collection, opposed fixed
distances. A second round of talks, hosted by the U.S. Navy in
Washington (with side trips to San Francisco and Disneyland) was
held during early May 1972. Despite President Nixon's May 8 announcement
of the mining of the harbors of the U.S.S.R.'s North Vietnamese
ally--an announcement watched on television by the Soviet naval
delegation in the home of the new U.S. Secretary of the Navy John
Warner--agreement (without fixed distances) was initialed on May
17,1972. The formal signature of the agreement, by Admiral Gorshkov
and Secretary Warner, took place on May 25 during President Nixon's
Summit in Moscow.
<P>
c) Terms of the U.S.-Soviet INCSEA Agreement
<P>
The terms of the U.S.-Soviet INCSEA Agreement (see Figure 1) have
two aspects: technical and political. The central technical focus
of the Agreement supplements the International Collision Regulations
(&quot;Rules of the Nautical Road&quot;) to restrict dangerous
maneuvers, discourage harassment, and provide specific channels
of communication. Two technical aspects of the agreement merit
mention in light of subsequent experience. First, submarines are
not included in the text of the Agreement, and only are subject
to the agreement when operating on the surface like a ship. Second,
the Agreement applies to interactions on the &quot;high seas&quot;--not
in territorial waters. The broader political aspect of the Agreement
is embodied in Articles VII and IX, which provide Navy-to-Navy
channels to exchange information on incidents and establish annual
review sessions that institutionalize Navy-to-Navy contacts.
<P>
These basic technical terms of the 1972 INCSEA Agreement have
remained but have been supplemented over the ensuing two decades.
At the first annual review conference in 1973, a protocol was
added which included non-military ships of both nations (such
as merchant and fishing vessels), requiring them to be notified
of the Agreement's safety provisions and prohibiting simulated
attacks or hazardous dropping of objects near
<P>
such ships. The &quot;special signals,&quot; in addition to those
already in the International Code of Signals, were developed,
revised over time, and provided to all ships of both parties as
provided in Article VI of the basic Agreement. These signals warn
of submerged submarines, flight operations and gunnery/missile
exercises, and can signal maneuvering or other intentions. In
1987, both parties agreed to add a voice radio circuit (VHF Channel
16) as another means of communications. In 1988, dangerous use
of lasers was added as a violation of Article 111. Agreement was
never reached on fixed distance requirements, despite continued
consideration of this issue.
<P>
The broader political aspect of the Agreement has likewise stood
the test of time. Even in the early 1980's, at the height of renewed
U.S.-Soviet Cold War, the annual review meetings and Navy-to-Navy
contacts continued. Indeed, the INCSEA Agreement proved to be
remarkably resistant to the ups and downs of U.S.-Soviet political
tensions in the latter decade of the Cold War.

<PRE>
Article I  Defines ships to mean both warships and      
           naval auxiliaries (such as intelligence      
           collection ships [AGI's], U.S. Coast Guard   
           and Soviet border guard ships), operating

           The Rules of the Road are not to be          
           narrowly used to dangerously disrupt ship    
           activities or formations, and ships are to   
           avoid hindering formation evolutions, and    
           stay clear of ships conducting flight or     
           underway replenishment operations.           
Article    Establishes rules to avoid dangerous

           maneuvers endangering the ships under        
           surveillance.  Ships are not to simulate     
           attacks (by aiming weapons at opposing       
           ships) nor are objects (e.g., sonobuoys,     
           flares) to be launched or dropped hazarding

<P>
d) Assessment of the 1972 U.S.-Soviet INCSEA Agreement
<P>
As will be seen in more detail in our analysis of recent incidents
below, the U.S.-Soviet INCSEA Agreement has been remarkably successful
in minimizing incidents between the two navies (for example, there
were no ship-to-ship incidents in 1990). This is all the more
noteworthy in view of the fact that the Soviet and U.S. Navy had
far more interactions and operations in proximity to one another
after 1972 than before. (This increased proximity was a reflection
not only of the Soviet Navy's full maturity as a globally deployed
open-ocean navy, but also a result of the increased frequency
of U.S. forward operations closer to Soviet home waters as a reflection
of the U.S. forward maritime strategy in the 1980s.) Those U.S.-Soviet
incidents at sea that did occur also appear to have caused less
diplomatic and public controversy than such incidents as the
<P>
1967 Walker collisions, since the addressal of these incidents
was automatically channeled through the established Navy-to-Navy
procedures. A variety of reasons for the general success of the
agreement have been suggested. The following characteristics of
the U.S.-Soviet INCSEA Agreement are most noteworthy for their
implications for other similar agreements:
<P>
Mutual interest in avoiding loss of life and expensive ships,
and avoiding escalation, even to hostilities, underpinned U.S.
and Soviet Navy agreement.
<P>
Specific and realistic provisions in the technical coverage of
the Agreement, made it straightforward and simple to implement
in both navies.
<P>
The professional, Navy-to-Navy character of the agreement gave
the navies of both countries a certain proprietary interest in
its success and discouraged, even at the height of the Cold War,
its political manipulation by either government as a propaganda
tool.
<P>
The bilateral nature of the agreement helped ensure confidentiality
and precluded political posturing to a multilateral audience.
<P>
Despite the overall success of the U.S.-Soviet INCSEA Agreement,
it would be unrealistic to expect that incidents had disappeared
entirely. However, as the survey of recent incidents below will
indicate, the major incidents between the U.S. and Soviet navies
since 1972 have involved areas beyond the reach of the INCSEA
Agreement-operations of submerged submarines, and operations in
territorial waters (vice the &quot;high seas&quot;). At the conclusion
of this chapter, ways of dealing with these problems will be considered.
<P>
The 1972 U.S.-Soviet INCSEA Agreement as Model: The U.S.-Soviet
Dangerous Military Activities (DMA) Agreement of 1989 and Other
INCSEA Agreements
<P>
If imitation is indeed the sincerest form of flattery, the authors
of the 1972 U.S.-Soviet INCSEA Agreement should be well pleased.
In June 1989, then-U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
Admiral Crowe and his Soviet counterpart General Moiseyev signed
an Agreement on Prevention of Dangerous Military Activities (DMA)
Patterned on the 1972 INCSEA Agreement. The DMA accord addressed
other dangerous military activities, for example intrusions into
territory or airspace (such as resulted in the 1983 shotdown by
the U.S.S.R. of the South Korean civilian airliner), dangerous
use of lasers, activities in areas of high tensions (such as the
Persian Gulf), and interference with command/communications networks.
Special communications procedures for air, land, and sea were
established. Like the INCSEA Agreement, the DMA accord provided
for incidents to be addressed by direct military contacts (at
Defense Attache level) and through an annual review meeting of
a Joint Military Commission. In summary, DMA provided a more general,
all-service agreement at the joint/general staff level.
<P>
The 1972 U.S.-Soviet INCSEA Agreement has been more directly emulated
by the ten other bilateral INCSEA Agreements reached in recent
years since the first new INCSEA accord (between the U.K. and
the U.S.S.R.) in 1986. Nine of these bilateral agreements involve
the U.S.S.R. with the following countries: U.K., Germany (1988),
Spain (1990), Norway (1990), Greece (1991), Netherlands (1991),
Japan (1993). In mid-1994 additional agreements were under negotiation
by Russia with South Korea and with Turkey. Although similar to
the U.S.-Soviet Agreement of 1972, these agreements were not carbon
copies, as reference was made to the new Law of the Sea provisions
and various other specific adjustments were made. In November
1990, the first INCSEA Agreement not involving the
<P>
U.S. and the U.S.S.R. was concluded between Germany and Poland.
This agreement may have been spurred by a 1987 incident in which
a West German naval ship observing maneuvers in the Baltic Sea
was hit by shells from a Polish naval ship.
<P>
In summary, the U.S.-Soviet INCSEA Agreement of 1972 has provided
a useful model for an all-service U.S.-U.S.S.R. agreement on Dangerous
Military Activities and for a variety of other bilateral INCSEA
Agreements. The brief general analysis which follows of global
incidents at sea since 1972, may suggest the effectiveness and
the limits of the INCSEA approach.
<H4><B>3. General Analysis of Recent Incidents at Sea</B></H4>

<P>
Before drawing conclusions on the implications of the INCSEA agreements
for security at sea in the post-Cold War environment, a brief
analysis of the major U.S.-Soviet and other, third country, incidents
at sea since 1972 is instructive. Dr. William J. Durch of the
Henry L. Stimson Center recently conducted a detailed analysis
of incidents at sea in the 1972-1989 period, which provides several
interesting insights and contains an excellent Table of selected
incidents.
<P>
a) U.S.-Soviet Incidents
<P>
In analyzing U.S.-Soviet incidents at sea over time, the number
of incidents remained low throughout the &quot;Detente&quot; era
from 1972 to 1977, increased somewhat (to a peak in the late 1970's)
as the Cold War intensified again in the 1978 to 1985 period,
then began to drop steadily from 1986 as Gorbachev came to power
and the Cold War waned. As noted earlier, it is particularly striking
that INCSEA procedures proved effective in minimizing incidents
despite the significant increase in U.S.-Soviet naval interactions
and in political tension in the early 1980s. By region, the most
U.S.-Soviet incidents have occurred in Northern European waters
(Baltic and Norwegian Seas), Atlantic Ocean, with significant
but fewer incidents centered in the Mediterranean Sea and Pacific
Ocean areas.
<P>
Several U.S.-Soviet incidents at sea since 1972 are worth noting.
First, in the October 1973 Arab-Israeli War -- when an all-time
Soviet high of nearly 100 ships operated near U.S. naval forces
in the Mediterranean -- there were various minor incidents but
overall surprisingly few serious events. This was particularly
fortunate, since any serious incidents at sea -- with both navies
present in force in an area of an ongoing conflict -- might have
quickly escalated to unintended U.S.-Soviet conflict. The next
major incidents occurred at perhaps the height of U.S.-Soviet
Cold-War hostility, following the September 1983 Soviet shotdown
of the Korean airliner in the Sea of Japan. Soviet ships reportedly
harassed U.S. naval ships conducting salvage operations in the
Sea of Japan. In November 1983, a Soviet frigate collided with
the U.S. destroyer Fife in the Arabian Sea after reportedly disrupting
carrier flight operations. In early 1984, a Soviet Victor I nuclear
attack submarine collided with the U.S. aircraft carrier Kitty
Hawk in the Sea of Japan. A week later, the Soviet carrier Minsk
fired flares at a U.S. frigate, hitting the ship and only narrowly
missing the captain. In February 1984, Soviet aircraft fired near
a U.S. destroyer in the Black Sea. Again in February 1988, during
one of the periodic U.S. exercises of the right of innocent passage
through Soviet territorial waters in the Black Sea, the U.S. destroyer
Caron and cruiser Yorktown were harassed and suffered several
collisions with Soviet ships. Several collisions between U.S.
and Soviet submarines have occurred since 1972, including several
supposedly inside Soviet-claimed territorial waters. In 1986,
a U.S. submarine was damaged when it collided in the Strait of
Gibraltar with a Soviet submarine.
<P>
The most recent incidents of the post-Cold War era have again
involved submerged submarines not covered under the 1972 INCSEA
Agreement. On February 11, 1992 a modem Sierra Class nuclear attack
submarine of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) navy
collided with the U.S. Los Angeles-class nuclear attack submarine
Baton Rouge while surfacing off the Kola Bay in the Barents Sea.
The U.S. submarine was at periscope depth, probably monitoring
naval activities out of this Soviet naval base. The Russians protested
that the U.S. submarine was in Russian territorial waters, but
U.S. leaders rejected this, noting that the U.S. and Russia disagree
on territorial waters limits (Russia claims an area within a straight
baseline drawn across the Kola Bay, beyond the 12-mile limit observed
by the U.S.). (A subsequent statement by a Russian Northern Fleet
spokesman claimed that such submarine collisions &quot;had been
an almost annual occurrence b etween 1967 and 1986, but that this
was the first registered case since then&quot;). The U.S. Secretary
of State, Baker, broke with the past silences on both sides and
informed the Russian President Boris Yeltsin, in Moscow, that
a U.S. submarine was involved. More recently, on March 26, 1992
the Commonwealth of Independent States Navy claimed to have chased
a foreign submarine from her territorial waters off the strategic
Barents Sea port of Murmansk. Most recently, another minor US-Russian
submarine collision occurred in March 1993.
<P>
As Dr. Durch's analysis indicated, submarines have also been involved
in many incidents with fishing trawlers and their nets, often
in the local waters adjacent to the submarines' home country ports.
The U.K. Royal Navy recently announced a thirty-percent cut in
submarine operations in its Clyde area, and a compulsory two-mile
distance between fishing boats and submarines, after four deaths
in the accidental sinking of a fishing boat in November 1990.
<P>
b) Other Significant Naval Incidents
<P>
The most notable non-U.S.-Soviet incidents at sea over the past
twenty years have involved various global disputes over territorial
waters, and incidents in the Persian Gulf area during the 1980-1988
Iran-Iraq War.
<P>
Disputes over territorial waters have occurred between a variety
of nations around the globe. Perhaps the longest series of hostile
incidents has occurred between the U.S. and Libya over the Gulf
of Sidra area. Libya's Colonel Qaddafi has claimed a vast area
in the Southern Mediterranean, the Gulf of Sidra, as Libyan territorial
waters, while the U.S., in defense of freedom of the seas, has
challenged those claims to avoid their recognition by acquiescence
and the setting of an unfavorable precedent. As early as March
1973, and again in September 1980, Libyan fighters shot at (but
missed) a U.S. reconnaissance aircraft in this area. In August
1981, U.S. Navy fighters shot down two Libyan fighters which appeared
to be attacking them. In March 1986, U.S. naval forces conducting
&quot;freedom of navigation&quot; operations in the Gulf of Sidra
sank two challenging Libyan patrol boats. Again in January 1989,
U.S. Navy aircraft shot down two Libyan fighters. Elsewhere, we
have already noted how Greek-Turkish disputes over territorial
waters and airspace brought both countries to the brink of war
due to incidents surrounding the activities of a Turkish oil exploration
ship in March 1987. In the South China Sea, territorial disputes
exist between many nations over the Spratlies and Paracels Islands
groups, which led to hostilities between the navies of Vietnam
and the P.R.C. in March 1988. Attacks on, and seizure of, South
Korean and Japanese fishing boats by North Korea have been recurrent
incidents creating tension in Northeast Asia, as have Soviet seizures
of Japanese fishing boats near the disputed &quot;Northern Territories&quot;
islands north of Hokkaido. Indeed, fishing boat seizures, in the
new Exclusive Economic Zones as well as in territorial waters,
have been common global occurrences even between such close allies
as the U.S. and Canada (indeed, fishing rights disputes led to
a series of dangerous collisions of U.K. naval ships and Icelandic
fishing boats during their &quot;Cod War&quot; of the mid-1970s).
<P>
In addition to these disputes over the extent (and exploitation
of) territorial and adjacent waters, the other common category
of recent major incidents has involved the presence of neutral
naval forces in the waters of the Persian Gulf during the 1980-1988
Iran-Iraq War. In May 1987, two Iraqi aircraft-launched Exocet
missiles struck, and nearly sank, the U.S. frigate Stark in the
Persian Gulf. Later that summer, the U.S. seized an Iranian vessel
laying mines in the Gulf. In April 1988, after an Iranian mine
severely damaged a U.S. frigate in the international waters of
the Gulf, U.S. Navy ships and aircraft destroyed two Iranian oil
platforms and sunk or damaged six Iranian naval vessels. In early
July 1988, the U.S. Aegis cruiser Vincennes shot down by error
an Iranian Airbus civilian airliner crossing the Persian Gulf.
As was the case in the North Atlantic during the early World War
I and War II periods, the actions of the combatants in the Persian
Gulf during the Iran-Iraq war tended to lead to hostile incidents
which affected neutral naval forces--not to mention the extensive
damage to neutral merchant shipping.
<P>
In summary, since 1972 the U.S.-Soviet INCSEA Agreement seems
to have been successful in minimizing incidents between the two
navies. Perhaps the most serious recent incidents have involved
two areas which were intentionally not covered by the INCSEA Agreements--disputes
over territorial water boundaries and operations of submerged
submarines. Other major incidents since 1972 have centered also
on disputes over territorial water (and airspace) boundaries,
notably between the U.S. and Libya, but also between other neighboring
countries in the Aegean Sea, the South China Sea, East China Sea,
and Sea of Japan areas. Finally, maritime areas surrounding ongoing
wars (such as the Persian Gulf) remain a source of hostile incidents
with neutral shipping and navies.
<H4><B>4. Conclusions: Minimizing Incidents at Sea in the Post-Cold
War World</B></H4>

<P>
With the end of the Cold War (and even of the Soviet Union), it
is appropriate to consider the broader implications of the 1972
INCSEA Agreement for minimizing incidents at sea in the post-Cold
War world. The 1972 U.S.-Soviet INCSEA Agreement has been successful
in both technical terms--reducing the frequency and severity of
incidents--and political terms--in establishing regular professional
Navy-to-Navy meetings which served broader confidence-building
and tension reduction goals.
<P>
Our earlier analysis makes clear that the INCSEA Agreement was
not designed, however, to deal with two other sources of incidents
at sea--disputed boundaries of territorial waters and airspace,
and the operations of submerged submarines. Our analysis has also
indicated that incidents at sea on a global (not just U.S.-Soviet)
basis frequently arise from two major sources: disputes over the
boundaries of territorial (and Exclusive Economic Zones) waters
and airspace, and attacks on neutral shipping and navies in maritime
areas adjacent to an ongoing conflict (such as the Persian Gulf
during the Iran-Iraq conflict in the 1980s). Our conclusions below
will consider potential ways to minimize the incidents resulting
from these circumstances.
<P>
Recent positive developments in bilateral actions to deal with
the &quot;gaps&quot;-territorial waters disputes and submerged
submarine operations--in the 1972 INCSEA Agreement, may provide
some positive lessons for other nations in the international community
dealing with similar problems.
<P>
Since 1986, the U.S. and the Soviet Union have engaged in a series
of bilateral law of the sea negotiations, conducted by diplomats,
with the participation of naval officers. The 1988 incidents,
where U.S. naval ships Caron and Yorktown had minor collisions
with Soviet ships protesting their &quot;innocent passage through
Black Sea territorial waters&quot;, provided a final spur for
both countries to act to end years of incidents in this Black
Sea region. The law of the Sea discussions resulted in a Joint
Statement in September 1989 by Secretary of State Baker and Foreign
Minister Shevardnadze, in which the U.S.S.R. joined the U.S. in
acknowledging the right of warships to transit the territorial
sea in innocent passage, and the U.S. acknowledged that &quot;innocent
passage&quot; challenges in this Black Sea area would no longer
be necessary. Bilateral law of the sea negotiations are continuing,
with a focus on resolving disputes over the boundaries of territorial
waters, straight baselines or historic bay claims in areas such
as Kola Bay in the Barents Sea and Peter the Great Bay in the
Sea of Japan. The recent February 1992 U.S.-Russian disputes over
the location, relative to territorial waters, of the U.S. submarine
that collided with the C.I.S. submarine in Kola Bay indicates
the importance of ongoing bilateral negotiations between nations
having disputes over territorial waters boundaries to resolve
these disputes. Keeping such negotiations separate from any agreements
on incidents at sea seems to be an appropriate course of action,
as disputes over boundaries of territorial seas and airspace and
Exclusive Economic Zones involve interpretations of the law of
the sea best addressed in an international legal context through
diplomatic channels, rather than by the Navy-to-Navy military
channels of INCSEA Agreements. The implications for similar disputes
in the global context-- Greek-Turkish disputes in the Aegean,
India-Pakistan disputes, conflicting claims of multiple nations
in the Spratlies and Paracels Islands of the South China Sea,
and North and South Korean disputes--is that the international
community should strongly encourage bilateral and, where necessary
(e.g., South China Sea) multilateral law of the sea negotiations
to resolve these disputes that are perhaps the most frequent cause
of incidents, and more often involve fishing boats rather than
naval ships. Pending the slow resolution of such disputes, disputing
nations might do well to adopt provisions similar to those in
Articles II and III of the U.S.-Soviet Dangerous Military Activities
agreement of 1989, designed to avoid incursions (and to communicate,
if they cannot be avoided) into the territory of other nations.
<P>
Solving the problem of the involvement of submarines in incidents
at sea is more difficult. The inherent stealthy nature of submerged
submarines in the &quot;silent service&quot; of all nations precludes
the various visual communications possible under the INCSEA Agreement.
Although underwater communications on sonar are possible, such
actions reveal the locations of transmitting submarines. The governments
of the U.S. and its major submarine-capable Allies have long rejected--as
a violation of the concept of freedom of the seas, and as a negation
of the unique value of the submarine--another radical solution
formerly trumpeted by the U.S.S.R. and some Western arms controllers,
of establishing &quot;keep out&quot; areas in international waters
which submarines would pledge to avoid. Indeed, even the Soviet
Navy, with the largest submarine force in the world, readily agreed
with the U.S. Navy to exclude these stealthy vessels (except when
on the surface like another ship) from the provisions of the 1972
INCSEA Agreement.
<P>
Despite the recent February 1992 and March 1993 reminders that
submarines may be a source of incidents at sea even in the post-Cold
War world, resolution of this problem is not simple. &quot;Keep
out&quot; areas will continue to be rejected by the U.S. and many
other nations as a violation of the basic principle of freedom
of the seas. Another way of avoiding potential submarine collisions
is &quot;waterspace management,&quot; where separate areas for
different nations' submarine operations are established, and 'Submarine
Notes' on area submarine presence are exchanged. In the past,
such procedures have been limited to close NATO Allies. At a time
now when U.S. forces are preparing joint military exercises with
Russian and other former Warsaw Pact opponents it is conceivable
that cooperative submarine procedures could be considered. But
the new security environment has not quite progressed that far
yet, and may not do so as long as the monitoring of deploying
ballistic missile submarines by the &quot;national technical means&quot;
of a covert, forward-deployed submarine is still deemed necessary.
<P>
This leaves three possible near-term courses to minimize (primarily
US-Soviet, but potentially other nations' submarine incidents).
First, nations should be governed by a &quot;general prudential
rule&quot; regarding submerged submarine operations in territorial
waters whose precise boundaries are disputed (such as the Kola
Bay). While separate diplomatic bilateral law of the sea negotiations
proceed to reach agreement on disputed boundaries, and given the
overall post-Cold War improvement in relations, it might be wise
to maintain monitoring submarine operations outside the disputed
area of territorial waters. Should a collision occur, the recent
notification of the other nation involved by Secretary Cheney
should set a precedent for notification of involvement. Second,
an even more ambitious near-term step might be to agree, in the
INCSEA Agreement context, to require submarines to avoid simulated
attacks on ships or submarines of the other party and to require
transmission on sonar when a dangerous underwater situation of
close proximity is discovered. Rear Admiral Hill, in making similar
suggestions earlier, noted that &quot;the intelligence penalties
could be considerable&quot; but also questioned whether 'the risks
are worth it' in continuing traditional covert submarine practices
in dangerous situations. Third, to avoid the frequent problems
of incidents in which submarines damage fishing trawlers in coastal
areas, nations should ensure their submarines minimize submerged
operations in their coastal fishing areas.
<P>
Having addressed these problems of the existing prototype 1972
US-Soviet INCSEA Agreement, it is appropriate to consider the
continuing relevance of similar INCSEA Agreements to the post-Cold
War world. Three possibilities, not necessarily exclusive, exist
for using the 1972 INCSEA Agreement as a model to reduce future
incidents at sea.
<P>
First, there are other nations which should consider appropriate
bilateral INCSEA agreements modelled on the US-Soviet agreement.
Despite the list of recent bilateral INCSEA agreements between
NATO nations and the USSR noted earlier, there remain numerous
nations around the globe whose relations are unfriendly and whose
opportunities for interaction and incidents at sea are frequent.
Potential candidates include: Greece-Turkey, Israel-Syria, Iran-Iraq,
India-Pakistan, numerous nations bordering the South China Sea
(including the PRC), PRC-Russia, Japan-PRC, Japan-Russia, and
North and South Korea. Where appropriate, such INCSEA agreements
should be paralleled by diplomatic-legal negotiations to resolve
law of the sea disputes over territorial and Exclusive Economic
Zone boundaries. Additionally, given the fact that incidents of
many smaller nations frequently involve fishing vessels vice naval
ships, provisions (similar to those in the US-Soviet DMA Agreement)
to minimize hostile incidents from intrusions in territorial waters
might be included in any INCSEA agreement, and made applicable
to fishing and merchant vessels.
<P>
The second possibility is to use the proven US-Soviet bilateral
INCSEA Agreement as a model for appropriate regional agreements.
To avoid a messy proliferation of bilateral agreements among the
new post-Soviet nations and others in the Baltic Sea and Black
Sea, for example, a multilateral INCSEA agreement might be useful.
Other areas where proximity and shared interests in avoiding incidents
among a variety of nations might be useful include the South China
Sea and the Sea of Japan area. Unlike the US-Soviet INCSEA Agreement,
agreements in the regions that are relevant would likely have
to address incidents in territorial waters (as well as the &quot;high
seas&quot;), and include merchant and fishing vessels as well
as naval ships and auxiliaries. In short, these agreements would
be more in the nature of broad regional &quot;Maritime Safety
and Confidence-Building&quot; accords than a narrowly focused
accord on naval incidents. The broader regional nature of such
agreements may make them more difficult to negotiate, and will
in all cases raise difficult questions about the geographic scope
of the agreement, as well as the impact on (and involvement of)
extra-regional naval and other ships. Nonetheless, the concept
of regional &quot;maritime safety&quot; agreements may well be
appropriate for at least the specific areas identified above.
<P>
The third possibility for building on the 1972 US-Soviet INCSEA
Agreement is the suggestion in the 1985 UN Report on the naval
arms race that &quot;consideration should be given to making multilateral
the existing bilateral agreement between the Soviet Union and
the United States.&quot; The Swedish Delegation to the United
Nations later circulated a draft multinational treaty on incidents
at sea, and the Disarmament Advisor to the Swedish Minister of
Defense has written in support of such a multilateral regime.
Establishing as international norms the INCSEA technical provisions
for naval forces on the high seas to avoid dangerous maneuvers,
restricting harassment, and establishing communications would
probably help to avoid some incidents. However, the political
aspects and benefits of the bilateral US-Soviet INCSEA Agreement--the
vested interest of two large navies frequently interacting on
the high seas, and the regular professional and confidential Navy-to-Navy
contacts--would not be so apparent in a multilateral agreement.
Many countries with very small, coastal navies would be minimally
involved, and if regular review of implementation were done in
a multilateral context, the temptation to &quot;play to the audience&quot;
might increase and result in public polemics. These potential
drawbacks of a multilateral INCSEA Agreement have led the United
States to oppose such an agreement. The Soviet Union, on the other
hand, in June 1990 tabled a proposal at the Vienna CSCE negotiations
for a multilateral INCSEA Agreement among CSCE members. In the
post-Cold War environment, it is possible that a multilateral
proposal to deal with naval incidents on the high seas might be
re-evaluated as a narrow supplement to existing bilateral INCSEA
agreements dealing with naval forces on the high seas. This approach
would retain and broaden the technical benefits of the INCSEA
measures to discourage dangerous maneuvers and harassment and
encourage communications, while retaining the political benefits
of confidential Navy-to-Navy discussions under existing bilateral
INCSEA agreements (or, on request, between two parties to the
multilateral agreement).
<P>
A final source of incidents at sea has been attacks on neutral
naval and merchant ships in waters adjacent to an ongoing conflict,
such as the Persian Gulf during the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq War. Although
existing laws of war address many of these situations, the US
and the USSR, as a result of the close operations of their forces
in the dangerous Persian Gulf area, agreed to a provision in the
1989 Dangerous Military Activities Agreement for designating a
region as a &quot;Special Caution Area&quot; where special communications
would be maintained to avoid potential incidents (such as an attack
by a third party resulting in bilateral incidents). Although the
increased danger to naval and air forces in a zone of conflict
is a natural problem, nations might consider including in any
bilateral, regional, or multilateral INCSEA agreements a provision
on special &quot;caution area&quot; designation and special communications
similar to that in the recent US-Soviet DMA Agreement.
<P>
In conclusion, the experience of the 1972 US-Soviet Incidents
at Sea Agreement (and the 1989 US-Soviet Dangerous Military Activities
Agreement) suggests several supplementary approaches to minimize
incidents at sea in the post-Cold War world. The existing and
additional bilateral agreements still provide a sound technical
and political basis to reduce special bilateral incidents at sea.
There may be benefit in certain specific regions to a regional
&quot;Safety at Sea&quot; approach which broadens these provisions
through a regional agreement addressing also non-naval (fishing
and merchant) shipping and including regional territorial waters
(as well as the high seas). Additionally, the time-tested provisions
of the US-Soviet bilateral INCSEA Agreement requiring naval forces
on the high seas to communicate and avoid dangerous maneuvers
and harassment might be incorporated into a multilateral agreement
open to all nations. It is significant to note that these bilateral,
regional, and multilateral approaches are not necessarily mutually
exclusive. Nor can they deal with the problems of inherently covert
submerged submarines, law of the sea disputes over boundaries
of territorial seas (and Exclusive Economic Zones), and the danger
of incidents in waters adjacent to an ongoing conflict. A flexible
variety of bilateral and multilateral actions is needed to minimize
these latter more difficult causes of incidents at sea. These
include continuing appropriate bilateral and multilateral negotiations
on agreed interpretations of law of the sea boundaries, prudent
caution in forward submerged submarine operations near disputed
boundaries (and perhaps provisions for submarine underwater communications
in extreme situations of perceived close danger), and agreements
for special designation and appropriate communication of ships
and aircraft in dangerous zones of ongoing conflicts. A proper
complementary mix, of these suggested actions can help further
reduce global incidents at sea in the post-Cold War world.

<H2><B>NON-MILITARY COOPERATION IN THE MEDITERRANEAN AND NORTH
AFRICA</B> </H2>

<P>
<B>Professor Salvino BUSUTTIL</B>
<P>
Director-General, Foundation for International Studies
<P>
University of Malta<HR>

<P>
The forms of non-military cooperation in the Mediterranean and
North Africa on which I shall concentrate are basically classical
and conventional, that is they are essentially based on somebody
from the North contributing something to the South. The main area
of concentration concerns the environment especially the marine
environment. In this context, the principal success lies with
the Mediterranean Action Plan which, launched in 1975, was subsequently
given its institutional frame-work through the Barcelona Convention
to which all Mediterranean States plus the European Union are
signatory. That Convention, on the protection and conservation
of the Mediterranean Sea against pollution has had a chequered
history. It operates through five regional centres broadly corresponding
to the Protocols which now enrich the Convention.
<P>
Following the Nicosia Charter in 1990 and the Cairo Declaration
of 1992, the contracting parties to the Convention agreed on the
initiative of the European Union, that it was important Sustainable
Development be pursued, so that environmental and developmental
concerns be brought together. However, apart from official declarations,
there is very little to show so far for this move.
<P>
A further area of co-operation is in fisheries, especially through
FAO's General Fisheries Council of the Mediterranean; and, in
agriculture, through ICAMAS, the International Centre for Advanced
Studies in Mediterranean Agronomy which, inter alia, also promotes
Aquaculture. There is, of course, also Euromar, to the extent
practicable under the Eureka Projects which however is limited
to a few Mediterranean countries which have been able so far to
participate. The latter project, in particular, is considered
to be a model for the creation on a joint basis of research and
development between the North and the South and should be extended
to provide technological co-operation in a number of areas.
<P>
In so far as University co-operation is concerned, Med Campus
and the Community of Mediterranean Universities as well as, lately,
the University of the Mediterranean (UNIMED), foster networks
of co-operation between major universities. However, there is
still a considerable potential to be fulfilled. I think that the
first necessity is technological co-operation especially through
the identification of regional needs to which regional technological
solutions should be found.
<P>
I referred earlier to Eureka as providing a possible model for
this co-operation. It would seem to me, for example, that solar
desalination could be a good candidate for a focus of co-operation
using those sources (i.e. the sea and the sun) which are plentiful
and would of course contribute in an important manner to the solution
of one of the major problems in the Mediterranean, North Africa
and the Middle East: the supply and distribution of water.
<P>
Again, in the sphere of fisheries co-operation so far is very
limited. There are no regional or even bilateral fisheries. Sea
routes are non- existent in the sense that there are no agreed
routes in the Mediterranean. Similarly, for emergencies at sea,
especially for major catastrophies there is no stock-piling of
equipment; and the southern countries, in particular, would in
an emergency, still have to rely on assistance from countries
such as France and Italy and, to a lesser extent, Spain and Greece.
<P>
Moreover, the countries of the South also need important and urgent
assistance for the disposal of liquid and solid wastes, and for
the transport of toxic material which unfortunately, still finds
its way from the North to the South. There should also be a more
responsible attitude towards tourism which, in the manner it is
now being conducted, adds a source of upheaval in the Southern
countries, particularly through the modes and styles of life which
it suggests; and which, for economic as well as cultural and religious
reasons, the South finds it difficult to follow even as its younger
generations seem to want to ape it.
<P>
Increasingly, I find that in the Mediterranean it is important
that an act of courage be taken towards institutional advancement
i.e. to have a mechanism, however simple and however inexpensive,
to bring together the countries of the Mediterranean. Interesting
concepts have been mooted such as the Council of the Mediterranean,
a Mediterranean Agency or a Mediterranean Authority. It would
seem to me that the creation of a Mediterranean Commission for
Sustainable Development, bringing together environmental and development
concerns, could be a major step in this direction. Such a commission
could be created by a protocol to the existing Barcelona Convention
and could, at least during an initial period, be linked to the
administrative and institutional arrangements of the Mediterranean
Action Plan.
<P>
At the same time, the Mediterranean Forum held in Alexandria last
July has now raised the possibility of greater co-operation in
economic, political and cultural affairs. Indeed, the next meeting
is being held in Portugal proceeded by gatherings on economic,
political and cultural issues. It may well lay the ground for
the creation of such a commission as I have just referred to.
Ultimately, however, it is in technological advancement that the
real solutions to regional ills can be found.
<P>
Co-operation between government and universities as well as with
industry, especially in research and development, is essential.
Of course, for the South this may not be an easy matter because
few Southern countries have a tradition of this type of co-operation.
But in a situation where the ratio of GNP devoted to research
funds is now in the ratio of about 3/40 : 1 between North and
South, the need for technological advancement in order to motor
economic growth and development is imperative.
<P>
In this context, Confidence Building Measures (CBMS) are of course
important. But they should not lead to one-way traffic i.e. CBMs
coming from the North to the South. Since they are Confidence
Building Measures, they must be authentic, and they must arise
as much from the South as from the North. Secondly they must not
be so projected as to convey the impression of an &quot;imposition&quot;
of values. Let us not forget that values constitute a very basic
problem and are rooted in ethnic, religious and cultural traditions,
which through their differences, contribute to instability and
insecurity in the Mediterranean.
<P>
Neither must we continue to promote a transfer of technology based
on an import/export mentality from the North vis-&agrave;-vis
the South, respectively, especially where the technology exported
is obsolescent and environmentally &quot;poor&quot;.
<P>
CBM's should be genuinely inspired. They should also involve non-governmental
organisations. After all, it is not only and perhaps not even
primarily Governments, that introduce and instill Confidence Building
Measures. Confidence is a human resource and therefore cannot
be imposed by governments.
<P>
Some conclusions:
<P>
It is evident that Mediterranean countries need to pool their
resources. In this context, the above-mentioned proposal for a
Mediterranean Commission for Sustainable Development might provide
the framework necessary. Confidence Building Measures must be
seen as responding to regional needs or through the needs of a
particular area of the region and must be so conceived, so promoted
and so implemented as to show objectively and without any ambivalence
that they are meant to raise the standard of living of the peoples
of the Mediterranean, of North Africa and the Middle East, in
a setting of durable peace and lasting security, a security which
is not so much military as much as a guarantee against poverty,
injustice and equality.

<H2><B>REMOTE SENSING : THE TOOL OF INTEGRATED COASTAL ZONE MANAGEMENT
</B></H2>

<H2><B>Towards Peace in the Mediterranean</B></H2>

Abstract
<P>
Remote Sensing, GIS and mathematical modelling are emerging as
the new enabling technologies that could be utilised for continuous
environmental sustainability. Such tools together with an integrated
resource management approach developed on a national and regional
scale, and the establishment of a regional data communications
infrastructure will facilitate peaceful regional co-operation
in the long term.
<P>
Space technology in the Mediterranean is still associated with
spy satellities and is not seen as a potential environmentally
friendly technology. Regional iniativites like for example oil
spill monitoring, which is a simple excercise to carry out with
remote sensing have still not happened, in spite of the legal
frameworks already established under the UN Environmental Programme
(UNEP) and the Mediterranean Action Plan (MAP).
<P>
The task to shift the paradigm from a security equals military
balance approach to a security equals peaceful cooperation is
indeed a very daunting one.
<P>
In this paper an attempt is made to present a vision of the Mediterranean,
whereby a regional data communications infrastructure will facilitate
the implementation of an integrated management approach, which
will, in turn, enable a fast and sound decision making. In this
scenario a new and creative business culture will grow and flourish
which will propel the Mediterranean region towards a new type
of prosperity and long-lasting peace.
<H4><B>1. Geographical Characteristics of the Mediterranean</B>
</H4>

<P>
The Mediterranean is described by a particular type of climate,
as well as a complex geology which determine the coastal landscape
characteristics. The Mediterranean coastline itself defines a
virtually enclosed sea, highly saline because of heavy evaporation
which is not balanced by inputs from rain and rivers. An inflow
which passes through the Straits of Gibraltar from the Atlantic
maintains the sea-level. The Mediterranean waters are comparatively
warm and governed by surface currents which change during the
year. The complexity of these currents reflects that of the sea's
structure. In addition, the Mediterranean tides are weak, an extremely
significant feature which facilitates shipping, but at the same
time is detrimental to the problems of pollution along the coast.
<P>
The Mediterranean basin lies at the centre of a very intricate
patchwork formed by tectonic plates of the earth's crust sliding
under one another. This gives rise to strong seismic and volcanic
activity, which many times leads to tragic human upheavals.
<P>
The four major river deltas (Rhone, Ebro, Po and the Nile) are
considered as unstable areas, in the sense that they are very
sensitive to variations in the sea level, with rapidly alternating
periods of erosion and sedimentation, reflected by advancing or
retreating shore-lines.
<P>
The sea-level changes experienced in the Mediterranean also aggravate
the fresh water situation, a scarce resource in most parts of
the region, as saltwater intrusion &quot;pollutes&quot; the aquifers.
<P>
Against this background of a highly fragile physical environment
the Mediterranean countries are facing similar rapid resource
depletion and environmental deterioration due to demographic,
social, cultural, political and economic pressuresThese environmental
scenarios require therefore to be studied in their complexity,
using a holistic approach and within a global framework. To reach
this goal, a regional strategy needs to be devised that could
be acceptable to all countries of the Mediterranean. To reach
this goal, a regional strategy acceptable to all Mediterranean
countries needs to be devised.
<H4><B>2. The Regional Strategy</B></H4>

<P>
The strategy which should be aimed at political, scientific and
business levels should facilitate the introduction and implementation
of an Integrated Resource Management approach at the local, national
and regional level.
<P>
Primarily, the strategy has to define what constitutes an integrated
approach, secondly, what will be the objectives of such an approach
and thirdly, what are the tools to achieve effective results.
<P>
The fundamental approach of Integrated Resource Management is
based on the premise of shared information, that is, an easy flow
of data from one sector to another. The revolutionary aspect of
this approach will be that information passes not only vertically,
i.e. it follows not only the usual hierarchical organizational
structure, but information flows also occur laterally, that is,
from one sector to another. The latter flow is then not necessarily
restricted towards the top of the sector, as it may indeed occur
predominantly at the level where the actual data is required.
The basic idea of IRM is based on open networks, the size and
the number of the points in the network depending on the task
in hand.
<P>
The short-term and long-term benefits of Integrated Resource Management
will be in having all the necessary data available whenever a
need presents itself, thus enabling both prompt and sound decision-making.
<P>
The tools required for IRM are clear: a data communications technology
infrastructure on a regional scale which would also allow for
real-time transmission from satellites and their data input to
strategic GIS nodes. These GIS data centres will collect, store
and have the facilities to utilize instantly information on the
environment, especially on coastal and marine resources as diverse
as water quality, fish stock movement, coastal urbanization impacts,
sea level fluctuations, coastal dynamics and so on.
<P>
Through the use of GIS and mathematical modelling capabilities
it will become possible to establish the carrying capacity of
any coastal resource; as well as to detect and contain natural
and manmade hazards, such as coastal erosion, effluent overflows,
oil spills, etc.
<P>
It is clear that the combined use of remote sensing, GIS and a
modern data communication infrastructure presents a necessary
condition to carry out resource management and coastal zone management
on a national and regional scale. However, for such management
to be effective it will be furthermore required that the above
tools are utilized and understood in a wider political, cultural
and economic context.
<H4><B>3. The Mediterranean Action Plan (MAP)</B></H4>

<P>
The presently existing regional diplomatic infrastructure is offered
through the Mediterranean Action Plan of the United Nations Environment
Programme (UNEP/MAP).
<P>
UNEP/MAP was set up in 1975 by the signatories to the Barcelona
Convention. It operates on a relatively small budget and is currently
concerned mainly with monitoring the Mediterranean environment
through MEDPOL. MEDPOL, with the assistance of about 200 scientific
groups from 83 institutions in 16 countries, gathers data on the
state and trends of pollution in the Mediterranean and carries
out research projects.
<P>
MAP marked the start of an international cooperation to clean
up the Mediterranean Sea. The Barcelona Convention has so far
provided the essential framework for common action and regional
decision-making.
<P>
Another element of MAP, the Blue Plan, looks ahead to the first
25 years of the next century and predicts dramatic demographic
change. According to its findings, the south, which had 32 % of
the Mediterranean countries' population in 1950, will account
for about 60 % in 2025. An estimated 400% increase in population
is predicted over these 75 years. As well as an increased resident
population, the region could experience the arrival of 158 million
tourists by 2000 and 260 million by 2025.
<P>
A newly established Regional Activity Centre(RAC) of MAP deals
with Environmental Remote Sensing(ERS). RAC/ERS is stationed in
Scanzano, Sicily. Amongst its recommendations it mentions the
monitoring of oil spills in the region, with the use of repetitive
satellite coverage. If the financial means and the political will
are found to achieve this particular aim, each coastal state would
benefit from such an early-warning system which could detect oil
spills before reaching the respective coasts and hence prevent
their contamination. Such a remote sensing operation should be
the first exercise of a regional integrated coastal zone management
infrastructure.
<H4><B>4. Some perspectives on integrated coastal zone management
</B> </H4>

<P>
More than 35% of the international trade in crude and refined
petroleum products is crossing the Mediterranean Sea, which is
very vulnerable to pollution, both from the ships carrying such
products as from coastal refineries and loading and unloading
terminals.
<P>
The most recent large-scale tanker disaster in Mediterranean waters
was the Haven explosion on 11 April 1991, when a Cypriot tanker
caught fire and exploded while at anchor, seven miles off Genoa
in Italy. The tanker, which carried 144,000 tonnes of crude oil
at the time, broke into three parts and it is estimated that more
than 10,000 tonnes of fresh and partially burnt oil were spilled
into the sea before the ship sank. Collection of the burnt residue,
which was highly viscous at ambient temperatures, proved very
difficult. The Italian authorities concentrated on deploying booms
to protect beaches but gale force winds soon carried both oil
and booms ashore.
<P>
Within the week following the incident, floating oil affected
beaches to the west of Genoa and strong winds buried oil in sand.
Some oil spread as far as the Hyeres near Toulon in France. The
coast of Monaco was also affected. It took ten days before divers
were able to stop the main leakage from the wreck.
<P>
In the same month about 140 people were killed when the ferry
Moby Prince collided in thick fog with an oil tanker moored in
the Italian port of Livorno.
<P>
The Paris-based Economic and Maritime Research Agency (Economar),
has shown concern that the multiplication of very fast passenger
ships on routes which are plied by large carriers, could result
in the repetition of similar or even worse accidents, and has
suggested that the Mediterranean should impose a system of compulsory
navigation control similar to that existing for aviation.
<P>
A radar system operating from a shore-based control and a monitoring
station would track ships' movements and make radio contact with
their masters to determine the identity of the ships and their
destinations. The shore station staff would then be able to advise
the ships on route-finding to help avert any potential collisions.
However, this plan, which has the support of the United Nations
Environment Programme's Mediterranean office, is being strongly
resisted by tanker owners.
<P>
While major incidents draw attention to the Mediterranean's problems,
the insistent background pollution must be considered equally
serious. Every year about 650,000 tonnes of hydrocarbons are released
in the Sea mostly through deliberate discharge of bilge and ballast
water from ships. New industries and industrial processes mean
that the cargoes are increasingly hazardous. Petroleum products
are not the only problem. Increased sea transport of industrial
chemicals, often carried on roll-on ferries, brings a growing
danger of accidental spills of toxic material.
<P>
The above mentioned cases are just a few examples of not necessarily
connected events and scenarios that could be monitored effectively
if a regional technological infrastructure can be put in place.
<H4><B>5. A Mediterranean Communication Technology Infrastructure
</B> </H4>

<P>
The establishing of a Mediterranean communication technology infrastructure
is a momentous task which cannot be achieved in isolation. The
European Union has already initiated and developed programmes
and projects in the last decade, which if extended to the Mediterranean
region could prove of mutual benefit. The present policy of the
EU for the Mediterranean encompasses programmes that deal with
Euro/Med partnerships such as Avicenne; Life; MedCampus; MedInvest;
MedSpa etc. Such programmes are meant to develop human networks
which would lead to other cooperative projects in the future.
These networks would be enhanced if supported by a regional data
communications infrastructure.
<P>
Moreover, it should also be realized that if the Mediterranean
is kept out of the communication technologies evolving in Europe,
it would create a future imbalance of development and standardization.
<H4><B>6. Telecommunications policy of the European Union</B>
</H4>

<P>
The Maastricht Treaty calls for the establishment of Trans-European
Networks which implies the preparation of guidelines for the introduction
of Broadband Networks in the Community. The Treaty foresees actions
favouring the interconnection and interoperation of the national
networks and the access to these networks, taking into account
the necessity to link the peripheral regions, that is the EFTA
countries, and in the more distant future, the Central and Eastern
European countries, with the central regions of the Community.
It does not consider the Mediterranean region.
<P>
Indeed, a far-sighted approach that should be the immediate concern
of the Mediterranean countries is to already adopt and adapt measures
to ensure the interoperability of data communications networks
and applications. Such a conformity in the overall technological
infrastructure will enable North South and East West communication
and will facilitate the integrated coastal zone management possibilities
in the Mediterranean.
<P>
The measures to be taken to ensure the interoperability of data
communications networks and applications are fourfold: they concern
the needs for common architectures, standardization, information
and training, and provision of data communications bearer services.
<H4><B>7. Architectures</B></H4>

<P>
One of the main difficulties in setting up networks between administrations
is the diversity and incompatibility of the national systems,
each of which has been developed separately but which must now
be interconnected and made interoperable. The definition and introduction
of jointly devised architectures is one way of solving the problem
while at the same time cutting down investment and operating costs.
<P>
The main purpose of a common data communications architecture
for networks between administrations will, therefore, be to create
and optimize the conditions under which the administrations independent
information systems are to intercommunicate over the telecommunications
networks.
<H4><B>8. Standardization</B></H4>

<P>
Since the major objective in the implementation of efficient data
communications networks is interoperability between the various
parts of a particular network and between different networks,
the use of common message formatting and communication standards
is a condition of success.
<H4><B>9. Information and training</B></H4>

<P>
In addition to all these activities, awareness campaigns will
aim to inform and train administrations directly and indirectly
concerned by the issues of trans Mediterranean and international
data communications networks, and to facilitate coordination and
monitoring between administrations at national and regional levels.
<H4><B>10. Bearer services</B></H4>

<P>
Finally, analysis of users' needs in the various areas of administration
involved in data interchange shows that three types of bearer
service will generally be required: electronic mail, file transfer
and access to databases for interrogation or updating.
<H4><B>11. The Potentially Leading Organisation in the Mediterranean:
CEDARE</B></H4>

<P>
The &quot;Centre for Environment and Development for the Arab
Region and Europe&quot; (CEDARE); may well prove to be the organization
to take on the task of leading the region to develop a data communications
infrastructure and to advocate a regional integrated coastal zone
management. At its first focal point meeting which took place
in Cairo in June 1993, a general consensus showed that CEDARE
should play an active role in creating a regional network enabling
multi-lateral cooperation. At an earlier meeting of its Technical
Advisory Committee, members recommended that CEDARE could be instrumental
in the collection, assessment and dissemination of information,
as well as the vehicle for introduction of new ideas, methodologies
and technologies in the region. More recently, CEDARE also decided
to set up an Information Service Unit (ISU), based on a modular
style, which could mean the start of a much larger information
network.
<H4><B>12. The Middle East Peace Accord</B></H4>

<P>
Last year's historic peace accord in the Middle East may well
prove to be the gateway to a new type of cooperation in the region.
It should give rise to new opportunities for economic growth which
will lead to prosperity on the one hand, but could contribute
further to the region's environmental degradation on the other.
However, with the right communication infrastructure and the right
management approaches, local and foreign businesses will be able
to grow and flourish. Set in an integrated management atmosphere,
a different economic culture may develop. These companies will
come to deal with environmental issues as matters of a strategic
concern. This means treating the environment as integral to overall
business planning and decisionmaking, and managing it as such.
<P>
These practices will, in the long-term, create wealth and propel
the Mediterranean towards prosperity and long lasting peace.

<HR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">The development of IT has made the modern
world increasingly interdependent and interconnected. Today's
trends and characteristics, which are likely to endure, will bring
about deep changes of economic, political and social structures
in nation states as well as in international relations. The impact
of these changes on diplomacy is in the focus of this part of
the Course.<BR>

<I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">IT AND CHANGES IN MODERN SOCIETY
<BR>
</FONT></I>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">The key question:<I><B> How will IT
affect the way people live, work and learn?<BR>
</B></I></FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Arial">Diplomats should have an understanding
of the profound changes in the production processes, and social
structure. They should also be aware of conceptual frameworks
and tools for the analysis of the modern world. These issues are
analyzed in proper economic, political, philosophical and sociological
perspectives. The main schools of thought explaining these phenomenon
is presented and reviewed.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">IT AND SOVEREIGNTY<BR>
</FONT></I>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">The key question: <I><B>To what extent
will the development of IT affect the ability of states to assert
their sovereignty in the international arena and over their national
destiny? <BR>
</B></I></FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Arial">Diplomacy is directly affected by the
changes in the concept of sovereignty. One of the main function
of traditional diplomacy has been to protect the sovereignty of
states. Is this going to remain the main function of diplomacy?
Given that sovereignty, the key element of state, has been seriously
challenged by modern processes, it is necessary to provide diplomats
with a general understanding of these processes as well as of
the future of diplomacy in new constellation of power.</FONT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">The key question: <I><B>Is it likely
that &quot;provinces&quot; and &quot;backwaters&quot; in the forthcoming
period will not be countries with geographical disadvantages,
but countries without access to the networks, or, for instance,
with IT-illiterate elites?</B></I> <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Arial">Professional education of diplomats
and foreign-policy decision makers has been based on the traditional
approaches to international relations (e.g. realist and idealist).
The main purpose of this module of the Course is to provide some
alternative approaches and to bring the diplomats' attention to
new perspectives of analyzing international relations. Special
emphasis is paid to the importance of geographical elements in
international relations. It is likely that the predominant determinant
of a country's economic and overall success is, among others,
the skills in managing information and data instead of controlling
territory or important geographical locations like it used to
be during the history of mankind.<B> <BR>

</B></I></FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Arial">Artifacts in digital form imposes a
new form of communication between individuals within the society
as well as between societies. IT will endanger traditional means
for protection and promotion of national culture and, at the same
time, create new ones. The special importance to this question
is in multi-cultural societies and regions (the Mediterranean),

<HR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">The growing centrality of IT-issues
in international relations has raised new and complex topics for
diplomats and foreign policymakers. Information Technology, which
already takes a huge share of economic transactions, requires
proper international legal and political framework. Creating this
framework, both on bilateral and multilateral level, is one of
the major tasks of diplomats. In order to perform this important
function, diplomats should have a broad knowledge of the various
aspects of IT-related issues from a technological, economic and
legal point of view.<BR>

is to provide the basic knowledge of IT commodities and services
with special emphasize on those that have or will have high importance
in international trade. The brief survey of major IT commodities
and services is provided, with special consideration of the protection
of software. As far as software is concerned the special attention
is paid on various components of the protection of software such
as: source code, operation systems, compilers, executable elements

<P>
<FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Arial">Transfer of technology, including IT,
is one of the core topics of the modern international economy.
It has special importance for north-south relations, development,
etc. The major task of this part of Course is to make a survey

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF0080"><FONT SIZE=+2>Welcome Speech by Prof. Fred Tanner, Director
of the Mediterranean Academy of Diplomatic Studies -  Conference Hall, Hotel
Corinthia, Attard, followed by: </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Excellencies, delegates, colleagues, Ladies
and Gentlemen,</FONT><BR>
</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It is both an honour and a pleasure to welcome you to
the opening of the First Euro-Mediterranean Information and Training Session.
We are in the presence here today of about 50 diplomats from a politically
defined area stretching from Finland to Jordan and from Morocco to Turkey.
The common bond to these different countries is the Barcelona Declaration,
that was successfully adopted last November by the European Union together
with 12 Mediterranean partner states. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Barcelona Declaration launched an Euro-Mediterranean
Partnership with an ambitious agenda that includes the establishment of
a free-trade area, the creation of a common area of peace and stability
and the promotion of social, cultural and human affairs. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>As in any agreement, the litmus test of commitment and
political will is reflected in the implementation process. The next few
months will show whether the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership is a paper
tiger or whether it is capable of mastering the monumental tasks lying
ahead.</FONT> </P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>We are very proud that the Academy based here in Malta
was chosen to make its own modest contribution to the success of the Euro-Med
partnership. Our mandate for this meeting is to assist desk officers and
other diplomats to efficently deal with the EU within the Euro-Med setting.
They are given in the next six days the opportunity to familiarize themselves
with the intricacies of the European Union, its bureaucracy and its institutional
and decion-making aspects. At the same time, the delegates will be exposed
to various interpretations of the Barcelona Process. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In final account, this one-week meeting serves the delegates
to get to know each other as they will be working on the same or similar
dossiers in their respective capitals. Personal contacts are a first step
toward creating a true culture of cooperation in the Euro-Med region. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It is important to note that this meeting is not a single
event, but part of a long-term process. The cross-cultural situation in
the Mediterranean necessitates to develop shared understandings of the
Barcelona commitments. Without shared understandings the building of a
partnership appears an impossible task. It is under this premise that the
Mediterranean Academy has assumed the responibility to act as a center
of information and training for the Euro-Med Community. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>This is why the meeting of this week will be followed
by another meeting next spring with the objective to bring to Malta high-level
officials for preparing the second ministerial meeting of the Barcelona
Process. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In the same spirit of long-term cooperation, the Academy
will offer to Euro-Med its extensive know-how in Information Technology
with the purpose of creating a permanent Information Hub for the Barcelona
process. In this context I am proud to announce that this week the founding
fathers of the Academy, the Governments of Malta and Switzerland, have
come to an agreement to extent their commitments towards the Academy for
another three years. This agreement will be instrumental in view of making
the Academy a truly Euro-Mediterranean institution. Other countries, such
as Italy and Tunisia make their own contributions to the Academy and the
next three years should see a broad involvement from other governments
and organisations with interst in Mediterranean affairs.</FONT> </P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Euro-Med spirit of cooperation is not a new concept
at the Academy. For the last 6 years, a total of more than 100 junior diplomats
from most Mediterranean countries have been training here in Malta. We
are currently training junior diplomats form 14 Mediterranean countries
and beyond. Their stay here in Malta over a period of nine month should
help to mold a new generation of diplomats with the necessary skills and
the broad understanding of how to effectively deal with obstacles to peaceful
interactions in the Mediterranean. I would like to welcome also these junior
diplomats to todays opening session. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It is now my privilege to pass the floor to two distinguished
speakers, who epitomize the benevolent instituional backing that this meeting
receives. H.E. Dr. Giorgio Boggio, Head of the Delegation of the Commission
of the European Communities to Malta will make the Introductionary Remarks.
He is followed by Mr. Joseph R. Grima, who represents Hon. Dr. Eddie Fenech Adami, Prime
Minister of Malta. </FONT><BR>

Quote from Prof. Kappeler's paper:
<HR NOSHADE SIZE="4">
<B>"Gumboot diplomacy may well become a hallmark of the ending 20th and the 
beginning 21st centuries, just as Gunboat Diplomacy characterised the behaviour 
of imperialistic powers in the late 19th and early 20th centuries."</B>
<HR NOSHADE SIZE="4">
<BR>

<IMG src="post-it.gif" align=left>The first association with "gumboots", that comes to mind, is<A HREF="debono.htm"> Edward de Bono's</A>
(Maltese philosopher and creative thinking praxeologist) work: Six Action 
Shoes.<P>

Just as a food for thought - it would be interesting to explore differencies 
and similarities in using "gumboots" by two authors as the metaphor for acting.<P>

<IMG src="post-it.gif" align=left>An occasional user of Web probabbly perceives using the Web as an endless 
jumping from one place to another, from one piece of information to another. 
However, the chain of links (providing they are consistent with subject 
matter) should be seen more in the sense of <A HREF="http://www.isg.sfu.ca/~duchier/misc/vbush/vbush7.shtml">
Vannevar Bush's trails</A>. The 
associative pathway, one takes, reflects that person's individual view to a 
certain subject and thus reveils the knowledge of that person that can be 
acquired or considered by others.

<P align=center><tt>
<I>&quot;What does independence consist of?  It consists fundamentally
and basically of foreign relations.  That is the test of independence.&quot;</I>

<P align=right>
Pandit NEHRU, 1949
</tt>
<P>
<B>Historical Background</B>

<P>
Efforts to organize and establish a Ministry of Foreign Affairs
in Malta started very soon after Independence in 1964.  At that
time, staff drawn mainly from the General Service of the Public
Service were selected to form the pioneer complement of the Ministry
of Commonwealth and Foreign Affairs.  It was soon agreed, however,
that an External Affairs Service had to be established on a professional
basis, and that the Service therefore required to have within
its ranks individuals with specific qualifications and aptitudes.

<P>
By mid-1965, the organization of the Ministry of Commonwealth
and Foreign Affairs was already taking shape.  The work of the
Ministry was divided into two main blocks: one dealt with administrative,
protocol, information and consular matters, while the other dealt
with political and commercial matters.

<P>

<blockquote><TT> <I>&quot;... the first steps were taken to start
forming an External Affairs Service.  The aim was set to have
a small diplomatic corps of trained and highly efficient officers
who, with experience, would be able to do their job with credit.
 What we were looking for were young men and women endowed with
the requisite intellectual capacity who had a genuine interest
in and dedication for the job, with strength of character and
an agreeable personality thrown in with physical and mental health.&quot;</I>
</TT></blockquote>

<P align =right>
F.E. Amato GAUCI <br>
'The Birth of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs'<br>
<I>The Times, Thursday 21st September, 1969</I>
</TT>
<P>
The External Affairs Service may be said to have been formally
set up in 1965.  Initially, it comprised the grades of Counsellor,
 First Secretary and Second Secretary.  In 1973, the higher grade 
of First Counsellor was created.  The Ambassador was generally 
a political appointee.  The rank of Envoy, at a slightly lower 
grade than Ambassador, also existed for a time.
<P>
About 90 candidates competed for vacancies in the first examination 
run to recruit officers in the External Affairs Service.  Between 
1965 and 1968, the Service's diplomatic complement rose to two 
Counsellors, three First Secretaries and thirteen Second Secretaries.
 In 1974, the External Affairs Service was abolished, and recruitment 
of Foreign Service staff did not continue, although a few diplomatic 
officers were appointed.
<P>
With the change of Government in 1987, interest in a Foreign Affairs
Service was revived.  After an internal process, some Counsellors
were appointed and an examination for First Secretaries was held
in April 1992.  The <U><B>Maltese Diplomatic Service</B></U> was
set up on a formal, sound and professional basis in October 1994.
 The maximum point of entry in the Foreign Service is now at the
level of Second Secretary, and public examinations have been run
for this purpose in March 1995 and in April 1996.<BR>

<P>
<BR>
The Parisio palace, which is higher up Merchants' Street, at the
corner of Melita Street, consists of three blocks built around
a courtyard. Its main fa&ccedil;ade is symetrical but the plan
is not. The facade is sober and with little emphasis on the centre,
save for an 
<!--<A HREF="mural/capital4.jpg">--><B>elaborate doorway</B></A>
and a broken segmental-headed window above, but the front is not
long, with only six windows in its length, so that the expedients
adopted in the other palaces need not be resorted to here. The
windows have beeen spaced so that a semblance of order was obtained
on the elevation and more or less regular spacing occurred inside
the main room (Sala Giorgio Borg Olivier nowadays - See the upper
right picture of the <A HREF="#FourInteriors"><B>four interiors </B></A>
pictures below). The corner has large superimposed pilasters,
the lower one being heavily rusticated. It is strange to notice
that the joints of the rustications bear no relationship to the
courses of the masonry. Also, the resemblance should be noticed
between the top-floor windows and those on the Selmun palace by
Cachia.

<b><h1>The Institute of International Relations of the University of the West Indies (IIRT)</h1></b>
<i><b>St. Augustine, Trinidad & Tobago </b></i>
<hr>


<h2>History</h2>

This Institute is based on an agreement between the governments of Barbados, Guyana, Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago, under whose provisions the said governments share among themselves the financing of the Institute. In 1972 the Institute received a new charter, which was incorporated in 1973 into a revised agreement between the sponsoring countries. 


<h2>Status</h2>

The Institute enjoys financial and academic autonomy but is affiliated to the University of the West Indies which awards its degrees. It is governed by a Board chaired by the Vice-Chancellor of the University of the West Indies. Members are representatives of the University, CARICOM, the OECS, the IUHEI, UNITAR and the funding countries.


<h2>Courses</h2>

The Institute offers a one year course for a Diploma in International Relations for diplomats, non-diplomats and ordinary students alike. Holders of the Diploma who also have a first degree may register for a M.Sc. in International Relations. The Institute also offers a course for a M.A. in International Relations by research and thesis alone, which may be followed by a Ph.D. in International Relations. The first such doctorate has been recently awarded. The teaching and working language is English.  From its inception, the Institute has also organised short training programmes in neighbouring countries, either as crash courses in diplomacy or concentrating on specific issues such as international negotiations.


<h2>Conferences</h2>

The Institute has hosted a number of conferences and seminars of which the one on Regional Integration held in 1987 and another on Narco-Trafficking in the Caribbean held in 1995 deserve special mention.

<h1><b>The International Relations Institute of Cameroon (IRIC)</b></h1>
<i><b>Yaounde, Cameroon</b></i>
<hr>

<h2>History</h2>

This Institute was set up in 1971 as a result of the decision of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace to discontinue its diplomatic training programme in Geneva. 

<h2>Status</h2>

It is an autonomous institute affiliated to the University of Yaounde II, which awards the degrees for its courses. Its main organ is a Governing Board chaired by the Minister of
Foreign Affairs and on which also sit the Minister of Education, the Chancellor and other representatives of the University and a representative of the IUHEI. The Institute has obtained consultative status with the Organization for African Unity.

<h2>Courses</h2>

The IRIC offers a course for a Master in International Relations for holders of a first degree. Holders of the Master's degree may enrol for doctoral studies. The IRIC also offers a Diplomatic Training Course for junior diplomats from African countries, which lasts one academic year. Teaching and working languages are French and English.

<h2>Conferences</h2>

The IRIC has over the years convened a number of colloquia and conferences, including the one which, in 1972, designed the African concept of an Exclusive Economic Zone which was later submitted as a common African position to the United Nations Conference on the law of the Sea. It has hosted several times an African Seminar on Humanitarian Law, in association with the International Committee of the Red Cross. In 1993, it hosted a Colloquium on the Challenges of African Diplomacy
on the Eve of the 21st Century.

<h1><b>The Institute of Diplomacy and International Studies of the University
of Nairobi (IDIS)</b></h1>
<b><i>Nairobi, Kenya</i></b>
<hr>


<h2>History</h2>

In 1973 an agreement was signed by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, the Kenyan Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the University of Nairobi for the creation at that University of a Diplomacy Training Programme (DTP). The IUHEI was asked to step in as a sponsor in 1976, under an agreement between Switzerland and Kenya. In 1989 the DTP was transformed into an Institute of Diplomacy and International Studies
with the assistance of the UNDP.


<h2>Status</h2>

The IDIS is an autonomous institution within the framework of the University of Nairobi, which awards the degrees for its courses. Its main organ is a Governing Board, on which the University and some of its faculties and departments are represented, as well as the Office of the President, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Finances,
UNDP and the Directorate of Development Cooperation and Humanitarian Aid of Switzerland. The Institute has a long- standing cooperation with the Commowealth Fund for Technical Cooperation (CFTC). It is in the process of obtaining consultative status with the Organization of African Unity, the UN Economic Commission for Africa and the African Development Bank.


<h2>Courses</h2>

The Institute offers a one year course for a Postgraduate Diploma in International Relations, taken over from its predecessor, the Diplomacy Training Programme. This course is specially designed and reserved for African diplomats. The Institute also offers a two year course for a Master of Arts in Diplomatic Studies accessible to any candidate fullfilling the academic admission requirements. For the moment, no doctoral studies are envisaged. Although the Institute is officially bilingual English/French, the main teaching and working language remains English.


<h2>Conferences</h2>

The Institute has organised a number of colloquia and seminars over the years, including one on the Training of Third World Diplomats in 1988 and another on Thirty Years of African Diplomacy in 1991.

Atlantis is a small citty state which whereabouts are luckily unknown to mankind. Atlantis has an active NGO community especially dealing with environmental problems and anti tourist actions. The main economic activity of Atlantis is raising cattle (seahorses and dolfins). The political system of atlantis is that of an absolute monarchy under King Neptunus. I could go on talking nonsense here, but this is enough for a dummy page.<P>

<p>

Video On Line Malta has been formed with the intention of offering the
Internet service to the Maltese islands and eventually spreading the
service to the southern and eastern countries in the Mediterranean. We are
now pleased to be collaborating with the North South Centre in the setting
up of the Internet Cafe for the Med Gate Conference in Barcelona. <p>

We strongly believe that what we are projecting for the Mediterranean is to
have a centrally located Information Technology Hub which can be accessed
by all Government  and Diplomatic Institutions around the Mediterranean.
These may not necessarily be directly in the Mediterranean, however the hub
will give the possibility for countries to centralise Databases and other
data transfer of governmental documents to one another through the
Information Superhighway. We hope to have further collaboration between
Video On Line Malta  and The North South  Centre on other projects in the
future and possibly become one solid information Team. <p>

<B>OPENING STATEMENT<BR>
<BR>
</B>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>The Hon. Prof. Guido DE MARCO</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>,
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs, Malta </FONT>
<HR>

<P>
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen <BR>

<P>
I thank you for giving me the opportunity to address another seminar
organised by the Mediterranean Academy for Diplomatic Studies.
I have strong affinity in the work of this Academy and I have
a great interest in its expansion and further success. Coming
here to discuss topics of world affairs is an exercise in international
relations. The fact that Prof. Bin is holding the Italy Chair
at this academy as being the mover of this conference on Co-operation
and Security in the Mediterranean after the Barcelona Conference,
I think has to be commended because it reflects more aspects than
one. It reflects this Mediterranean approach. It reflects Italy's
involvement in Euro-Mediterranean Affairs. In fact, as Prof. Tanner
has quite rightly pointed out, the fact that this is being held
in Malta reflects the role which Malta envisages, namely that
which aims at regularising relations in our regions. This is a
region which requires stability. This is a region which is in
turmoil. In Barcelona, we tried to create the basis for dialogue,
which in essence is what we are going to discuss today; What Co-operation:
what security in the Mediterranean following Barcelona? <BR>

<P>
Western civilisation knows its origins to the Mediterranean region.
It was here, in one country or other bordering the Mediterranean
littoral, that the development of western civilisation was unfolded
over many centuries. This momentum, however, was not sustained.
Our region regrettably lost the initiative and allowed other countries,
whether it be in other parts of Europe and elsewhere, to take
over what it had painstakingly developed in the first place. It
was no longer the principal actor in the drama of the history
of mankind. Instead, the region sank into an era of ideological
differences and internecine wars which undermined and held back
political, economic and social development. <BR>

<P>
Although the Mediterranean offers all the potential advantages
of a place of convergence, it has more often been an arena of
conflict than a forum for promoting complementarity and unity.
Despite a common patrimony in civilisation and many linkages,
the Mediterranean region remains today separated by contentions
and rifts. <BR>

<P>
We face, in our region, a multitude of complex challenges and
problems, ranging from economic deprivation, environmental degradation,
population explosion and migration to ethnic friction, intolerant
fundamentalism and the escalation of nationalism, the arms trade
and the disregard for international law. <BR>

<P>
There are, in my view, four challenges which are undermining peace
and stability. The first, is the huge economic discrepancy between
the northern and southern countries of the region which is intensifying
the root problems. These include weak economic structures, state
indebtedness, high demographic growth, and an alarming level of
unemployment. I will return and elaborate on this point later
on. <BR>

<P>
The second is the emergence on the southern shores of the Mediterranean
of extremism characterised by terrorism. Socio-economic crises
tend to form a fertile ground for extremist ideologies. The movement
negates universal values and offers no democratic alternatives.
If allowed to spread, it will turn back the clock to dark ages.
<BR>

<P>
Third is a prosperous arms trade, which is growing to the detriment
of economic and social development. The concentration of military
arsenals in the Mediterranean basin remains at alarming levels
because of a preoccupation with declared or potential conflicts.
<BR>

<P>
Fourth is the ecological factor. The pollution of the Mediterranean
Sea is reaching proportions which are alarming. Instead of being
treated in line with its ecological value and as an important
economic resource, the Mediterranean is being considered as everybody
else's domain. Unless together, we do not devise and implement
good-management-of-the-sea measures, the ecological factors will
constitute more instability in region. <BR>

<P>
Added to these challenges is the difficulty of putting into practice
a standard of international law. The lack of standard legality
is hampering the function of the Middle East peace process and
holding up further progress in the resolution of other pending
conflicts, such as those in Cyprus, the Western Sahara, Lebanon,
the former Yugoslavia and the Balkans among others. <BR>

<P>
The result of these and other challenges is insecurity and instability
not only on the southern shores of the Mediterranean region, but
for the entire region. The complexities of the problems that face
us today are such that it is becoming increasingly difficult to
confront them individually and in isolation at the level of separate
states. They necessitate an active participation and genuine solidarity
between all member states of the region. <BR>

<P>
The concept of security is constantly being re-examined and re-evaluated.
In the aftermath of the Second World War, it was thought the security
questions could be resolved by concluding military pacts. Later,
security was associated with arsenals of nuclear weapons and naval
fleets. This political-military strategy which dominated East-West
relations and influenced the North's relations with the South,
led to frustrations, bitter arguments and stalemates. <BR>

<P>
The failure of the political-military strategy led political thinkers
to seek other options to collective security. They developed the
concept of co-operative security. Whereas collective security
is an arrangement for deterring aggression through military preparations
and defeating it when it occurs, co-operative security is designed
to ensure that organised aggression cannot start or be prosecuted
on any large scale. <BR>

<P>
The strategic principle of co-operative security is to enhance
peace and security through institutionalised consent rather than
physical coercion. It seeks collaborative rather than confrontational
relationships among national military establishments. The emphasis
is less on preparation to counter threats than on the prevention
of threats in the first place. Thus, the significance of confidence-building
is obvious. <BR>

<P>
Co-operative security gave rise to the policy of d&eacute;tente
advocated so strongly by the then US Secretary of State and National
Security Advisor, Dr Henry Kissinger and their inviolability and
a commitment not to interfere in the internal affairs of signatory
members. <BR>

<P>
From our perspective, the Helsinki Final Act will always be remembered
in that it was for the fist time that on Malta's initiative security
and co-operation in Europe became linked to security and co-operation
in the Mediterranean region the so called Mediterranean Basket.
More than twenty year ago, in a world still dominated by the Cold
War the Conference for Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE)
recognised the need to promote the development of good neighbourly
relations with non-participating Mediterranean states. This nomenclature
of non-participating Mediterranean States within the OSCE created
a negative environment. It was through Malta' initiative that
in the OSCE Permanent Council December 1995 meeting in Budapest
the nomenclature was turned into Mediterranean Partners for co-operation.
This change in nomenclature is not just of cosmetic value. This
change, in so far as Malta is concerned, was made for explicit
purposes. One cannot participate for non-participation purposes.
One can only participate with partners. This is why Malta was
behind this change in nomenclature. <BR>

<P>
It is on this basis that the European Union has taken the initiative
to found the Renewed Mediterranean Policy. In 1989, it declared
its New Mediterranean Policy in view of the changes in the international
political situation, the globalisation of the economy, the widening
imbalances between North and South, and the completion of the
EU single market. The European Union, in order to be in a position
to withstand competition from the two main strategic areas of
America and Asia, has extended its partnership areas such as:
EFTA, Central and Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean countries.
<BR>

<P>
As a result of the Euro-Mediterranean Conference which took place
in Barcelona in November 1995, the 15 member states of the European
Union and the 12 countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea established
the basis for a lasting framework of collaboration. I am using
the word with a measure of optimism. The Declaration of the Barcelona
Conference gave three reasons for its desire to give a new dimension
to the future Euro-Mediterranean relations based on solidarity
and co-operation. These were: <BR>

<P>
* the strategic importance of the Mediterranean; 
<P>
* the necessity to guarantee peace and prosperity in the region;
and <BR>

<P>
* the co-ordinated answer which was required by new common economic,
political and social challenges. <BR>

<P>
For these reasons, the countries which met in Barcelona &quot;resolved
to establish a multilateral and lasting framework of relations
based on a spirit of partnership, with due regard for he characteristics,
values and distinguishing features peculiar to each of the participants&quot;.
<BR>

<P>
The three aspects of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership are: 
<BR>

<P>
* strengthened political dialogue; <BR>

<P>
* the development of economic and financial co-operation; and
<BR>

<P>
* greater emphasis on the social, cultural and human dimension.
<BR>

<P>
I would like now to dwell for some time on each one of these aspects,
in order to bring into perspective the ultimate objective of the
Barcelona Declaration: the creation of a zone of peace, stability,
prosperity and co-operation based on dialogue and solidarity.
<BR>

<P>
<B>Strengthened Political Dialogue<BR>
</B>
<P>
The objective of this partnership is to consolidate peace, stability
and security in the Mediterranean region. They agreed to establish
a number of common principles and interests, acceptable to all,
which the partners would undertake to promote together. <BR>

<P>
As a starting point, they agreed to act according to the principles
of international law and of different international declarations,
such as the United Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights, respecting fundamental freedoms and guaranteeing
their free exercise. <BR>

<P>
In internal affairs, Ministers of Foreign Affairs agreed to develop
the rule of law and democracy, recognising the right to choose
and develop freely their own political, legal, social and cultural
systems, guaranteeing the respect of diversity and fighting against
intolerance and racism. They declared their readiness to abstain
from whatever direct or indirect intervention in internal affairs,
respecting the territorial integrity of all partners and using
pacific means to solve conflicts. <BR>

<P>
We agreed to act in favour of chemical, biological and nuclear
arms non- proliferation by complying with the different international
and regional non-proliferation agreements. They also concurred
on the need to organise activities to combat terrorism, organised
crime and drugs. <BR>

<P>
In order to implement the principles of the Barcelona Declaration,
a work programme is scheduled whereby senior officials will meet
periodically to conduct a political dialogue, to decide the most
adequate methods and to submit proposals for the meetings of Foreign
Ministers. <BR>

<P>
<B>The Development of Economic and Financial Co-operation: An
Economic and Financial Partnership <BR>
</B>
<P>
The objective is to build a Euro-Mediterranean zone of shared
prosperity by accelerating the pace of sustained socio-economic
development, improving the living conditions of the population,
increasing the level of employment, reducing the development gap,
and promoting regional co-operation and integration. 
<P>
To this end, an economic and financial partnership is set to be
established based on the following guidelines: <BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>1. The gradual establishment of a free trade area
by the year 2010<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
This is an ambitious approach. An action plan is put forward,
setting out the framework, priorities and arrangements for partnership
in order to establish a Euro-Mediterranean economic area based
on free trade in accordance with the obligations arising under
the World Trade Organisation. A calendar will be negotiated in
order to eliminate tariff and non-tariff barriers on manufactured
and agricultural products, even though the latter will be progressively
liberalised through reciprocal preferential access. To facilitate
the process, it will be necessary to adopt measures concerning
rules of origin, certification, protection of intellectual and
industrial property rights, and to develop policies based on the
principle of free market economy and integration, and on an adequate
legal and institutional framework. The modernisation of the economy
and the social effect on the needy population are also important
factors in the establishment of a free trade zone. <BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>2. Economic co-operation and concerted action
<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
It is considered necessary to help internal savings, direct foreign
investment and voluntary regional co-operation, eliminating possible
obstacles. It is also important to achieve agreements between
companies, establishing an adequate legal frame for it, and to
offer to the Small and Medium-sized Enterprises technical support
programmes. The environment is considered as an important issue
tied with economic development, and therefore a short and medium
term programme will be established, which will be granted with
technical and financial assistance, giving priority to combatting
desertification. The Declaration also enhances the key role of
women in economic and social development. Finally, it is necessary
to co-operate in specific areas, such as energy and agricultural
policy and to improve infrastructures, to promote co-operation
in regional planning and in Research and Development to harmonise
statistical techniques. <BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>3. Financial co-operation<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
The success of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership requires an
improvement in financial assistance, that should be managed by
local agents to achieve an indigenous and sustainable development.
The European Union has promised 4,685 million Ecu for the period
1995-99 through MEDA programme, in addition to loans from the
European Development Bank and bilateral financial loans from member
states. This co-operation will be managed on the basis of a multi-annual
programme that will be promoted through dialogue, and should take
into consideration the importance of sound macroeconomic management.
<BR>

<P>
<B>Greater Emphasis on the Social, Cultural and Human Dimension:
A Partnership in Social, Cultural and Human Affairs. <BR>
</B>
<P>
The objective is to develop human resources, promote understanding
between cultures and exchanges within civil society. In this context
of decentralised co-operation, the emphasis is placed on education,
training and young people, culture and the media, migrant population
groups and health. Greater co-operation in the field of justice
and home affairs is also envisaged, with action in particular
directed against drug trafficking, terrorism and international
crime. We have to evolve in the Mediterranean a 'people to people'
approach. I think this is of the essence of things. May I give
you Malta's specific approach about the issues I've been explaining
in so far as Barcelona is concerned. The concept of these three
pillars, the making of Barcelona as an ongoing process is the
essence for its success. We cannot speak about the spirit of Barcelona
if we refer to Barcelona in the past tense. It only has a meaning
if it is poised in an ongoing process future concept. We know
and we realise that in order to promote the social pillar and
the economic pillar, basic to all this is the first pillar, namely
the political and security pillar. 
<P>
It is with this in mind that when twenty years ago Malta launched
the concept of the linkage between the security in Europe and
security in the Mediterranean, we realised from our location in
the centre of the Mediterranean, that one cannot speak for security
in Europe if one disregards Mediterranean issues.<BR>

<P>
The fall of the Berlin Wall will have lasting effects on the future
of Europe and the Mediterranean States as far lasting as the fall
of the Bastille because it is not simply the fall of a wall; a
great divide has been broken too. It is not only a unification
of Germany which has taken place; it is a breakdown of an artificial,
ecological and military barrier. <BR>

<P>
The effects of the fall of the Berlin Wall and the effects of
the end of the Cold War, through historical coincidence happened
here in Malta with the Bush/Gorbachev Meeting. In the words of
Eduard Shevardnadze in his book. The Future is for Freedom, we
read,
<P>
&quot;in the tempestuous seas in Malta we buried the Cold War&quot;.
<BR>

<P>
Which Mediterranean therefore, do we see emerging from the end
of the Cold War? Which problems still persist from the Cold War?
The absence of having the Mediterranean poised in a confrontational
issue between the two blocs and the effects of a non-polar world
on the Mediterranean region. We are still confronted with a Mediterranean
region, having its northern shores belonging in the main to the
NATO alliance, and its southern shores fragmented in search of
an identity, troubled by an economic situation which is the main
reason for present disruptive effects. The Middle East Peace is
a process which we think is fundamental for the future of the
Mediterranean. Unless the Middle East Peace Process continues,
the Mediterranean region will find no peace. It will be the greatest
of tragedies if terrorism wins over the peace of the brave as
it was defined. And it will be one of the tragedies of history
when terrorism prevails over dialogue. I think both Chairman Arafat
and Shimon Peres were very clear when they stated in no uncertain
terms that it was easier to wage war than to wage peace. Peace
can only be brought about through dialogue and it is through dialogue,
where the present problems can be discussed and eventually solved,
that Malta believes that there is no alternative to the Peace
Process. <BR>

<P>
It will be the tragedy of us all to succumb to terrorism and stop
a process which can be the only way to guarantee a future for
the people of the Mediterranean region and beyond. We think again
that for the Mediterranean region to discover itself, it needs,
above all stability. On the 20th March 1995, I had the privilege
to attend the Final Conference of the Pact on Stability in Europe,
the so called Balladur Plan. And there for the first time Malta
launched its proposal for a Stability Pact for the Mediterranean,
a Stability Pact which has to be not inspired by the same reasons
and by the same situation which exist in Europe, particularly
in Central and Eastern Europe, nor necessarily by the same round
table approach which was evolved, particularly, for minority issues
in Central and Eastern Europe. The concept of stability for our
region has to be clearly seen by identifying the sources, and
the elements destabilising the Mediterranean, be they terrorism,
or fundamentalism. In this context, I will never use the phrase
Islamic fundamentalism. This is one of the misnomers which is
creating a lot of harm and a lot of misunderstandings. Islam is
one to the great religions, one of the peace factors in global
affairs. And identifying a retrograde approach with a religion
which has permanent values is one of the mistakes which sometimes,
we in politics and some also in diplomacy, manage to commit. 
<BR>

<P>
Fundamentalism is one of the sources creating the destabilising
factors in our region. The same applies also to massive unemployment
which exists in so many regions. There are areas with 50/60% unemployment.
There are areas where we have not only the classical proletariat,
but where an intellectual proletariat, has been created, with
ambitions of power, using the emotive forces created by poverty
in order to ensure a situation where there is a revoking of power
games. Are these the factors that destabilise the Mediterranean
region? <BR>

<P>
May I also say that in this region of ours there are two Curtains.
One creating a stronger barrier than the other. These are the
Poverty Curtain and the Prejudice Curtain. These two curtains
that are creating a great divide in the Mediterranean region.
That is why Malta has proposed the Stability Pact for the Mediterranean.
We appreciate the fact that the French Foreign Minister De Charrette
in Barcelona has also advanced the concept of a Stability Pact
for the Mediterranean. I think it will be certainly a major contribution
to preventive diplomacy having this Stability Pact in place. May
I also add that we have always tended to look at the Mediterranean
in a vertical approach. We suggest that to this vertical approach
should be added the horizontal approach. That is why we have suggested
time and time again, a Council for the Mediterranean; an Association
of Mediterranean States; a Partnership between Mediterranean states;
which does not amount only to the economic partnership envisaged
in the second pillar of Barcelona. Through this horizontal approach
towards the Mediterranean one can evolve a different framework
where the Mediterranean can dialogue. A dialogue taking place
both at governmental level and at parliamentary level. <BR>

<P>
The oldest European institution is the Council of Europe, a Council
where we used to have committees for non-member states, when at
the time, we used to look at the Council of Europe as a beacon
directed towards the Central and Eastern European countries and
also towards the Iberian Peninsula. And this beacon lit. Today
the Council of Europe, which some describe as a club, has created
a European democratic space from the Atlantic further into the
Urals. We in the Mediterranean, without imitating but merely by
adapting ideas, which were proven right, can adapt to our own
region. And this is why we believe that starting from a Council
of the Mediterranean, an Association of Mediterranean States,
we can build this concept of dialogue in this explosive region.
<BR>

<P>
This is something which we have to realise. We have no time to
spare. I have always repeated that the Mediterranean is a time
bomb with an ever shortening fuse. It is difficult to speak about
a Mediterranean identity. We take this Mediterranean region with
all components: whether Europeans, whether Arabs, or whether belonging
to the Middle East. But when we speak about a Mediterranean identity,
it is difficult and on the other hand, understandable, that we
have common interests, common concerns and that we have a common
heritage. <BR>

<P>
So without losing our own identity, I believe we can and will
ensure a process in the Mediterranean region which will create
stability. We need stability. If we face this challenge, the Mediterranean
challenge, much will be achieved both for us belonging to the
region, and for those beyond. This is why the Mediterranean which
resulted from the Barcelona Conference, has to be an on-going
process, a dynamic process, a peace process. <BR>

<P>
<B>THE EURO-MEDITERRANEAN PARTNERSHIP AFTER BARCELONA <BR>
<BR>
</B>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Jean Pierre DERISBOURG</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>,
Advisor to the Director General, DGIB, Directorate General for
External Relations, EU Commission, Brussels</FONT>
<HR>

<P>
After decades of bilateral relations with Mediterranean countries,
the EU decided, during the last European Summits, in Corfu (June
1994), in Essen (December 94), in Cannes (June 95), to propose
a real partnership to our southern neighbours.<BR>

<P>
The main reasons were: <BR>

<OL>
<LI>after the collapse of the USSR, the EU was attracted to the
east, with the possibilities of accession for central European
countries and the Baltic states.
<LI>The Commission and Member states wanted a fair balance in
favour of our neighbours of the south shore who cannot accede
to the EU; 
<LI>the regionalisation within the globalisation of the world
economy is a clear trend: Nafta in North America, with a possible
extension to South America; Mercosur between four Latin-American
countries; Asean and, possibly APEC, in Asia. The new rules of
WTO imply that the EU will have to review its network of bilateral
agreements with the Mediterranean neighbours; 
<LI>the need to address a new set of threat perceptions. There
is of course no longer a danger of military aggression and less
risk of interrupting the oil supplies through the Mediterranean.
Yet the European public opinion fears in the 1990's; 
<LI>a swap over of local or regional turmoil like in Algeria,
Palestine, Kurdistan or Egypt, into terrorism, insecurity, criminality
in Europe linked directly or indirectly to fundamentalists (from
any region); 
<LI>a security risk to European tourists and businessmen visiting
the Mediterranean;
<LI>a more and more uncontrollable flow of migration, asylum seekers,
job seekers, or people who are looking for better political, social
and economic conditions than in their home countries; 
<LI>an uncontrollable flow of drugs, whether hashish, cocaine
or opium derivatives;
<LI>the ongoing and recent proliferation of chemical, bacteriological
or even nuclear weapons in the Middle East. 
</OL>

<P>
The old threat perceptions, military conflict or oil embargo,
diminished, but these new threats are now increasing and helping
the extreme right political parties in Europe.<BR>

<P>
What are the possible answers to this situation? There was a wide
consensus in Barcelona on the need to stabilise the socio economic
situation in Europe's neighbourhood in the southern Mediterranean
shores with two objectives, peace and stability on one hand and
an important brake to emigration on the other hand. Reducing the
&quot;prosperity gap&quot; has become one of the key targets of
European policy. The prosperity gap is actually 1 to 12 according
to the World Bank and could well widen to 1 to 15 for the decade
1995-2005.<BR>

<P>
The main characteristics and philosophy of this new partnership
are: <BR>

<OL>
<LI>a non-paternalistic relationship based on the acknowledgement
of interdependencies and common interests, of the right to development
and freedom, the need for decentralised co-operation, the key
role of the private sector, continuous dialogue at all levels:
intergovernmental and between civil societies; 
</OL>

<OL>
<LI>a multidimensional co-operation in its action and its instruments.

</OL>

<P>
How will it work after Barcelona? The work programme adopted is
divided in three baskets:<BR>

<P>
1. Political and security partnership: establishing a common area
of peace and stability<BR>

<P>
Senior officials, meeting already next week in Brussels, will
conduct a political dialogue to examine the most appropriate means
and methods of implementing the principles adopted in Barcelona.
Most probably they will start to work, with pragmatism, on a possible
list of confidence building measures, to be submitted at the next
Euro-Mediterranean meeting of Ministers for foreign affairs. Tunisia
and Morocco are both candidates to host such a conference in Spring
1997. <BR>

<P>
In parallel, foreign policy institutes in the region are encouraged
to establish a network for more intensive co-operation. This present
colloquium constitutes one step in the right direction.<BR>

<P>
2. Establishment of a Euro-Mediterranean free trade area<BR>

<P>
Whoever wants to transform the Mediterranean into a zone of peace
and stability, should focus attention on how to improve the socio-economic
situation in each of the countries concerned.
<P>
The negotiation of Association agreements, with each of the countries,
is expected to act as a powerful catalyst for opening the economies,
introducing free market systems and necessary legislative reforms.
This should give a spur to economic development, private investment,
job creation, less corruption, more transparency and accountability,
and contribute to the easing of social tensions within societies.
<BR>

<P>
Association agreements have already been negotiated and signed
with Tunisia, Israel and Morocco. Negotiations are going on with
Egypt and will start soon with Jordan and Lebanon. Explanatory
talks have started with the Algerians, the Palestinians and the
Syrians.<BR>

<P>
Bilateral agreements with the EU are not enough. We want the Mediterranean
partners to step up their co-operation with their neighbours.
They should be heading for a Euro-Mediterranean free trade area,
around 2010, similar to EFTA at the start. A network of agreements
is necessary for this purpose: Turkey, Israel, Cyprus, Tunisia
are already in discussions to establish such new relations. It
will be a long march, with a lot of difficulties, no doubt, but
this is the only way to build a real economic and political partnership.
The EU decided, in Cannes, on a major financial contribution to
sustain modernisation efforts: doubling the transfer of funds,
roughly grants of 1 bn Ecu each year until 1999 and the same amount,
or more, in loans from the EIB. Horizontal and decentralised policies
will continue in certain areas: environment, private sector development,
regional integration efforts by improving, before end 1996, instruments
like Med Invest, Med Campus, Med Urbs, Med Maedia, Med Migration.
<BR>

<P>
3. Partnership in social, cultural and human affairs<BR>

<P>
Actions will be soon decided: 
<P>
- in developing human resources: training, education; 
<P>
- in promoting understanding between cultures and civilisations,
such periodic meetings of representatives of religious institutions
or academics; 
<P>
- in pushing exchanges between civil societies: youth exchanges,
interaction between media, exchanges of experiences between municipalities
and regional authorities.<BR>

<P>
In conclusion, there is hope only if there is:<BR>

<P>
- a reasonable minimum of political stability, freedom and pluralism;
the continuation and the success of the peace process between
Israel and its Arab neighbours is therefore critical; working
together on confidence building measures will contribute to such
stability; <BR>

<P>
- a democratic commitment from Governments to share power and
to provide for periodic changes through political reforms; one
after another nondemocratic regimes will crumble peacefully without
revolution or civil war;<BR>

<P>
- a sound macro-economic policy which could inspire confidence
in domestic and international investors: co-operation of the EU
and its partners with international organisations, such as the
World Bank and the IMF will contribute to the success of this
policy; <BR>

<P>
- a limitation of Government interventions in the market mecha-nisms:
deregulation and privatisation will be necessary; small and medium
size enterprises could largely contribute to the diversification
of the respective economies; <BR>

<P>
- an harmonious development of the civil societies during a period
of time where the population of Turkey, Mashrek and Maghreb combined,
will be up to 300 m. by 2025. A real and sincere dialogue and
partnership will help to achieve, progressively and with flexibility,
all these challenges during the next 15 years.

<P>
<B>EUROPEAN SECURITY AND THE MEDITERRANEAN<BR>
<BR>
</B>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Guido LENZI</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>, Director,
Institute for Security Studies, Western European Union, Paris</FONT>
<HR>

<P>
Here in Malta, a few months ago, we heard President Arafat state
that &quot;security is a way of life&quot; : an important recognition
of the new international attitude in the post-Cold War era, where
confrontation and ideological intransigence have given way to
participation, co-operation and compromise. International security
has undergone radical changes, not only in posture but also in
mentality. Deepening and enlargement are the two directions of
the systemic change that is underway in Europe, with the intent
of projecting security eastward in Mitteleuropa, but also southward
in the Mediterranean. The Barcelona conference, which established
the Euro-Mediterranean partnership, mentioned security only in
its preventive aspects, political and diplomatic, assuming that
the relevant co-operative defence mechanisms would follow suit.
They now have to be addressed openly, without the ambiguities
and misunderstandings of the past.<BR>

<P>
The OSCE established European security mechanisms, which evolved
after the fall of the Wall. Are they suitable for the whole Mediterranean?
And if not, what adjustments could be made to satisfy regional
specificities? The first step can only be broader transparency
and dialogue. Barcelona set a similar framework and method, embracing
the whole region, regardless of the obvious local differences
of situations and perceptions. Security as such was kept aside,
on hold, until other practical prerequisites are in place. The
field should be opened before it can be leveld, and multifaceted
interconnections established, as a prerequisite for transparency,
mutual understanding and trust.<BR>

<P>
In Europe and elsewhere, defence is no longer so much a matter
of territorial defence, but rather of co-operative endeavours,
along the lines drawn by the WEU &quot;common concept&quot;, by
the new &quot;enlargement concept&quot; of NATO, and by OSCE behavioural
principles. This requires, in each country, North and South, not
only more specific commitments and training for peace support
operations, but mainly a more extensive information of public
and parliamentary opinions, to ensure the support that is necessary
for consistency, political sustainability and financing purposes.
<BR>

<P>
This presupposes a more coherent multilateral context, in which
national production of and contribution to security is as important
as the consumption of it, from which many benefitted in the fifty
years under the bipolar stalemate. Furthermore, the new multi-dimensional
and transnational challenges produce at the same time a globalisation
and a fragmentation of the responses. The erosion of state authority
under the pressure of the most varied &quot;self-determinations&quot;
can only be restored by international co-operative endeavours,
in many fields that were up to now the preserve of sovereign national
prerogatives.<BR>

<P>
Today, once a crisis has erupted, it is difficult to intervene,
contain and reabsorb. Prevention and mediatory interposition is
the name of the new game, which implies also interventions in
internal affairs. The UN itself, after the experiences of Somalia
and Bosnia, with their mixture of Chapter 6 and Chapter 7 of the
Charter, is not willing to engage directly in peace enforcement
any more, and will increasingly rely on regional arrangements
duly mandated under the provisions of Chapter 8. Sub-regional
aggregation and agreements are therefore indispensable for stability
and security purposes, which external interventions can only supplement,
not substitute. Especially in the many so-called &quot;out-of-area&quot;
contingencies, ad hoc mechanisms by the &quot;willing and able&quot;
are the most adequate to adjust to the shifting and unforeseeable
combinations and variable factors. Variable geometries and hard
cores apply to every country, whether it already belongs or aspires
to European security architectures (which should in itself dispel
any misperception of a Western hegemonic fortress).<BR>

<P>
This is how things stand in continental Europe. The same principles
and mechanisms should apply to the areas contiguous to it, first
and foremost to the Mediterranean. Strategically, the Mediterranean
area is not a coherent system, its problems are not military in
nature, sub-regional diversities are great. But a common mentality
must spread, similar to that which is applicable to Europe.<BR>

<P>
The WEU &quot;Common concept 27&quot; states that &quot;the Mediterranean
basin is a high priority for European security ... (calling for)
guidelines for co-operation (and) permanent dialogue&quot;, recognising
that there is no direct military threat from the South. Barcelona
has indicated the same initial stepping-stones. Soft security
measures, dispelling misperceptions, could consist in exchanges
of information, an inventory of the commitments undertaken, a
comparison of experiences, a review of co-operative models (for
peacekeeping operations, crisis prevention, consultation, assistance
- in particular within OAU; for non-proliferation; for the containment
of new risks). <BR>

<P>
An evolutionary process is underway, rather than a state of affairs,
in each of our countries, in continental Europe as well as in
the Mediterranean. For mutual relations to develop, the rediscovery
of one's own and each others' identities is a prerequisite, that
must involve the participation of all of the strands of our civil
societies.<BR>

<P>
Even the military instrument is nowadays subjected to these multiple
factors, as it adapts to a new preventive role, under conditions
of greater transparency. Prevention is the overriding requirement,
involvement rather than containment the new imperative. Transparency
and exchange of views and experiences are the essential instruments.
Pluralism of contributions constitute at the same time the goal
and the prerequisite for further advances.<BR>

<P>
In the Mediterranean, the North-South relationship must expand,
but it presupposes a South-South two-way street. European states
individually and the Commission must evolve beyond their bilateral
relationships with North African states. The Fifteen cannot however
deal with the North Africans one by one, lest they be accused
of ganging up: Europe, as Kissinger used to remind Europeans,
needs to dial &quot;one telephone number&quot; to reach most usefully
its North African partners.<BR>

<P>
After the Ministerial Council of Petersberg in June 1992, the
Mediterranean Group of the WEU indicated seven principles that
should inspire the Euro-Mediterranean endeavour in the security
field. They are: dialogue, transparency, confidence, conflict
prevention, sufficiency, peaceful settlement of conflicts and
non-proliferation of armaments.<BR>

<P>
Now that a broader concept of security is being accepted also
in the Mediterranean, the opportunity exists of addressing the
relevant military concepts, starting with CSBMs. They should achieve
transparency (through communications, exchanges, common strategic
language), co-operation (in PKOs also within OAU, humanitarian/civil
protection, nonproliferation and the tackling of new risks), working
groups (for bilateral, trilateral co-operative purposes), and
multinational operational endeavours (such as manoeuvres and exercises).
<BR>
<BR>

<P>
With such CSCMs, collective security would develop, as a process,
incrementally, in the Mediterranean as usefully as in continental
Europe, in the context of the partnership established in Barcelona.
<BR>

<P>
Since Barcelona, WEU within EU and the Mediterranean have a clear
road ahead of them. Political will should combine the evolving
events to provide the energy for all parties concerned to proceed
with a converging purpose, even if with different national contributions.

<P>
The Euro-Mediterranean Partnership (EMP), established by the ministerial
conference held in Barcelona on 28-29 November 1995, is the framework
in which the European Union (EU) is going to develop its new Mediterranean
policy in the years to come. Partners to the EU in this undertaking
are twelve Mediterranean non-member countries (MNC) of the Middle
East and North Africa (MFNA) area with more or less long-standing
relations with European institutions. This paper describes the
most important aspects of this policy and comments on its rationale
and prospects. <BR>

<P>
<B>Mediterranean instability and European security <BR>
</B>
<P>
As with Eastern Europe, the new relationship the EU is now seeking
to articulate with the MNCs stems primarily from security concerns.
Ongoing trends of political and economic instability in the region
affect European security perceptions. The EU proposal to its twelve
Mediterranean partners to set up an EMP is the collective European
policy response to security challenges emanating from Mediterranean
instability. Security and instability are hardly new problems
in the area. However, the end of the Cold War, the collapse of
the Soviet Union and the growing role Asian and Latin American
countries are acquiring on international markets have added new
and important dimensions to old challenges. Consequently, although
the completion of the bilateral treaties between Israel and the
negotiating Arab countries remains the cornerstone of the peace
process, the need to further the process by securing region wide
conditions for disarmament, socio-economic development and political
normalisation is just as important. Besides, while the ongoing
peace process focuses on the Near East and is predicated on the
US political role, the new challenges involve the wider MENA area
and require a growing European regionalist engagement. Proximity
is bound to assume a more important role as soon as the peace
process goes into the stage of consolidation and normalisation.
It is in this new post-peace landscape that the EMP is expected
to perform at its best, beside other multilateral and international
co-operation spheres like the MENA Economic Summit, and the REDWG
(Regional Economic Development Working Group) and ACRS (Arms Control
and Regional Security Working Group), both set within the multilateral
dimension of the Madrid Conference. <BR>

<P>
<B>Weak national consensus and socio-economic</B>
<P>
<B>underdevelopment<BR>
</B>
<P>
In the changing Mediterranean situation, the EU is called on to
help provide a response to two of the many factors of instability:
first, the absence or weakness of pluralism and consensus in Arab
domestic politics; second, the worsening of economic and social
conditions throughout the MENA area. A few words must be said
about these two trends before dealing with the EMP and its policies.
<BR>

<P>
Since the revolution in Iran in 1979, European public opinion
has been more and more impressed by the rise of political Islam
in the MENA area and its blatant anti-Western attitude. It tends
to perceive Islamism in itself (and eventually Islam as a culture)
as a challenge to its security. There is no doubt that the West
is regarded by Islamists as an enemy in many respects, in particular
because Western culture is seen as an instrument of global power
and oppression in the disguise of universal values, and because
the West is believed to support the regimes the Islamists are
strenuously fighting against. One should not overlook, however,
that Islamists are primarily opposed to domestic regimes and participate
beside other forces in national political processes. Islamists
must be regarded as part of a wider domestic opposition against
largely delegitimised governments strongly determined to hold
onto power. <BR>

<P>
The varying segments of the opposition have differing views about
the reasons current Arab governments are delegitimised. According
to the Islamists, governments have proved unable to assert Arab
and Muslim interests, like the liberation of Palestine, mainly
because they became subservient to the West and do not comply
with the <I>sharia</I>, thus causing the spiritual corruption
that eventually explains their political incompetence). Present
governments are accused of the same incompetence and subservience
to Western interests by old-fashioned nationalists. On the other
hand, the argument put forward in liberal quarters is that &quot;political
participation and palpable improvement in the quality of life&#133;
was sacrificed on the high altar of Arab nationalism&quot;. Given
that the regimes have neither achieved the objectives of nationalism
nor delivered an improvement in the quality of life, they have
lost legitimacy and should restore the political freedom that
their citizens have sacrificed in vain. In this framework, it
is only too obvious that Europe is attracted by the liberals,
while looking more than suspiciously at Islamists. However, the
central question from the point of view of European security pertains
less to the individual arguments and goals of the opposition than
to the fact that current governments deny pluralism and are unable
to integrate the opposition forces into some form of national
consensus. 
<P>
This is the real factor from which instability springs and, therefore,
the factor which affects European security and has consequently
to shape EU Mediterranean policies. <BR>

<P>
As for MENA socio-economic development, things are more evident.
The worsening of social and economic conditions in the region
with respect to other less developed regions has become clear
in the nineties. A report published by the World bank in October
1995 points out that in the last decade the MENA countries suffered
the largest decline of real per capita income (approximately 2%
a year) of any developing region and a 0.2% annual decline in
productivity. As a consequence of this decline in productivity,
the MENA countries achieve about half the output per unit investment
of East Asian countries. 
<P>
This economic decay coalesces with high rates of population increase
to stir both high unemployment and migrations. 
<P>
Poverty and unemployment are the most important - though certainly
not the only - factors in thickening Islamist ranks and feeding
extremism. In this framework, migration is characterised by a
widespread need to assert identity from a cultural but sometimes
even a political point of view. This creates attrition inside
Europe and contributes to make Europeans perceive Islam - whether
political or not - as a security risk or threat.<BR>

<P>
<B>The Euro-Mediterranean Partnership<BR>
</B>
<P>
In order to face these challenges to Mediterranean stability and
European security, the Declaration approved at Barcelona singles
out two main instruments of collective co-operation: (a) the &quot;regionalisation&quot;
of Euro-Mediterranean economic co-operation; (b) the establishment
of a mechanism for regular political co-operation and the implementation
of a common area of peace and stability.<BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>a) Regionalisation<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
The EMP agenda for economic co-operation is centred on the implementation
of a free trade area (FTA) by the year 2010 and - implicitly -
on a variety of radical changes which would enable the Arab economies
to take adantage of the growth opportunity provided by the FTA.
<BR>

<P>
The establishment of the EMP will put and end to the non-reciprocal
industrial preferences enjoyed so far by the MNCs within the framework
of their past agreements with the EU. As a consequence, while
maintaining the free access to European markets for their industrial
products (and, thanks to the Uruguay Round, expanding this access
to several previously protected products, such as textiles), the
MNCs will have to do away with protection and permit free access
to EU industrial products. At the same time, EU agricultural protectionism
will not be eliminated, though there is a general expectation
that it will be significantly reduced. <BR>

<P>
This agenda is a very serious challenge for the MNCs, for it will
bring about an extensive exposure to EU competition without providing
any significant additional market. Indeed, one may wonder why
they accepted it. The almost unanimous response is that the MNCs
had no other way out, as the agreements made under the Uruguay
Round will erode their European preferences anyway and, if they
don't proceed now to make their economies reasonably competitive,
they will become very soon more and more marginal and poor. Having
no alternative but to enable their economies to compete internationally,
the chance of doing it within a regionalist scheme may ease the
task. In fact, under the perspective of what is now called &quot;open&quot;
or &quot;new&quot; regionalism, the FTA is regarded as a way of
stimulating economies on the supply side, of compelling less developed
countries to improve productivity and of creating a &quot;public
good&quot; which will generate externalities. Another opportunity
is offered by the fact that they can pursue this option in a framework
in which they would be assisted by the EU. <BR>

<P>
For these reasons, the debate is centred, rather, on the strategies
the MNCs should adopt - such as deregulation, incentives to domestic
and foreign investment, public finance and other macroeconomic
policies - in order to go through such a difficult transition.
We won't enter into this debate here, but it must be noted that
the EMP contemplates a number of policies to help the MNCs' transition.
First, financial aid has been increased considerably (even though
per capita aid remains three times lower than that devoted to
the Central-Eastern European countries). It now amounts to 4,685
billion ECU (approximately 6billion US$), which will be coupled
by a similar amount in loans from the EIB, the European Investment
Bank. Second, unlike what used to happen with the old association
agreements, these financial resources will be previously allocated
on a country-by-country basis but will be engaged and disbursed
according to partners' individual ability to perform and succeed
in reaching assigned targets. Thirdly, the multilaterisation of
the market as well as the establishment of South-south regional
links inside the FTA is regarded within the EMP's agenda as an
essential condition for the Partnership's success. The simultaneous
enlargement of the market to all the non-EU partners should act
as an important demand-side advantage emanating from the FTA.
For this reason, beside economic restructuring and assistance
in reducing socio-economic gaps within the MNCs, part of the EMP's
financial aid will be devoted to supporting regional economic
co-operation and development. Moreover, the rules of origin will
be construed so as to give preference to products including as
much import as possible from other FTA partners. <BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>b) Political co-operation for peace and stability
<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
The EMP provides an entirely new element in the EU-MNCs relations
by establishing a mechanism for a Mediterranean political co-operation
(MPC) and by planning the implementation in the area of a &quot;common
area of peace and stability&quot;. Though the MPC may be related
to all the components of the EMP, there is no doubt that it will
above all inspire and direct the implementation of the common
area of peace and stability. <BR>

<P>
The MPC is a very light mechanism. But it is also very innovative,
in that it is not linked to specific objectives - as in other
Mediterranean co-operation schemes. It is directed first of all
to the broad task of establishing political consultation per se.
In this sense the MPC, as light as it may be, is a genuine institution,
dissimilar from, for example, the NACC (North Atlantic Co-operation
Council) or the Partnership for Peace but belonging to the same
kind of conflict preventive institutional multilateralism. <BR>

<P>
The institutional character of the MPC may prove too ambitious
with respect to the actual political cohesion of the EMP (and
therefore generate controversies or conflict) but it may also
be the only way to build up the common area of peace and stability
envisaged by the Barcelona Declaration, which is in turn just
as ambitiously predicated on the implementation of a long list
of principles related to pluralism, democracy and human rights.
Such principles (like human rights) are either eminently controversial
in Islamic-Western relations or blatantly disregarded by many
MNCs. 
<P>
It is difficult to predict whether and to what extent the Arab
regimes will comply with these principles and enable the common
area of peace and stability to materialise. To some extent the
principled common area approved at Barcelona is the price the
Arab MNCs had to pay to strengthen relations with Europe, in view
of the fact that, after the end of the Cold War and as soon as
the bilateral peace treaties in the Near East will be concluded,
US interest towards the MENA area will decrease, the need to reconstruct
the economy will prevail and Europe will necessarily become the
area's most important partner. Given this perspective, whatever
the EU will do or become, as EMP members the MNCs will retain
the advantage of having a say. But, in order to preserve such
a say, they will have to contribute to developing the EMP and,
with it, the principled common area that it includes. In order
to ensure a substantial degree of compliance and implementation
of the principles underlying the common area of peace and stability,
the MNCs' prominent political interest in developing the EPM will
be no less important than EU political conditionality and the
access to Arab civil societies provided to the EU by the EMP.

<P>
What will be the substance of the EMP's common area of peace and
stability? Beside co-operation in the field of &quot;soft security&quot;
(organised crime, terrorism and drugs problems, etc.), the pursuit
of the principles on which peace and stability are predicated
within the framework of the EMP means that it will concentrate
on attempting to develop and reinforce a Mediterranean framework
for crisis management, in particular a capacity for preventive
diplomacy and crisis prevention. The conditions for such a development
in the Mediterranean are different from those prevailing in the
OSCE area, particularly in Central and Eastern Europe. In most
of the OCSE area there are diffuse and vital interests towards
developing regional political integration and ensuring the survival
of collective security which - with the exception of the Mediterranean
countries which are candidates to become members of the EU - may
be absent or much weaker in the Euro-Mediterranean area. Nevertheless,
preventive diplomacy and crisis prevention are accepted and even
welcomed by many MNCs because, while allowing political co-operation
with the EU, they are less intrusive than other instruments of
collective security. <BR>

<P>
With respect to the variety of instruments of preventive diplomacy
and crisis prevention developed by the OSCE in the nineties and
the direct role the OSCE has been able to assume in managing prevention
functions, it is possible that a more cautious or traditional
diplomatic approach will prevail in the Mediterranean. For this
reason, the proposal put forward by the Barcelona Declaration
and stressed by France during the Conference, namely that of establishing
a Euro-Mediterranean Pact and proceeding along the lines of the
experience provided by the Pact of Stability in Europe, makes
sense. In relation to specific crises, a number of round tables
with the participation of the interested countries could be held
within the EMP. The round tables would make discussions and negotiations
possible and give the collective EMP institutions an adequate
and effective role. In European diplomatic quarters the establishment
of a Mediterranean Pact of Stability is regarded as less ambitious
and more feasible than the setting up of a Centre for Conflict
Prevention along the lines of the one working within the OSCE.
But for the time being there is no reason to rule out the possibility
of establishing such a Centre. <BR>

<P>
Apart from prevention and crises management, other security-related
aspects, like the establishment of Confidence Building Measures,
armaments reduction or control and anti-proliferation policies
may remain outside of the EMP (though the Declaration talks of
them). In principle, these issues should be tackled in other contexts,
like the Mediterranean Dialogues started by both the Western European
Union and NATO, or would require a more definite profile of the
EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy. For the time being, there
will be limits to the substance of a shared Mediterranean area
of peace and stability and this area will be based less on military-related
security than on a comprehensive concept of security. Nonetheless,
whatever these limits and the instruments the Euro-Mediterranean
partners will select to start implementing the common area of
peace and stability, this EMP dimension will emerge as a crucial
factor in carrying out Mediterranean co-operation, also because
stability and peace are essential conditions for economic reconstruction
and foreign direct investment.<BR>

<P>
<B>Conclusions<BR>
</B>
<P>
The EMP is the result of a remarkable and successful effort by
the EU to innovate and reinforce its Mediterranean policy. This
effort has been marked by both continuity and change. Continuity
is secured by the assertion of the European democratic identity,
embedded in the principles of democracy, freedom, pluralism and
respect for human rights, which have been incorporated into the
Barcelona Declaration; also, by the privileged role assigned by
the same Declaration to decentralised co-operation, the interaction
of civil societies and the development of cultural relations within
the EMP. Change is reflected in the articulation of a new structured
strategy of regionalism, predicated on the establishment of an
FTA as well as in the search or a common area of peace and stability
aimed at providing security and supporting economic development.
<BR>

<P>
For the time being, several important challenges to security and
stability, such as migration, have a minor role in the EMP. If
the EU members manage to agree upon a common policy towards migration,
the latter may become a major issue to deal with in the framework
of EMP crisis prevention. In any case, the newly-born EMP can
be regarded as an important platform for the improvement of EU
security towards the Mediterranean areas and the upgrading of
the coherence and impact of the EU's Common Foreign and Security
Policy.

<B>AFTER MADRID AND BARCELONA: PROSPECTS FOR MEDITERRANEAN SECURITY
<BR>
<BR>
</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Nabil FAHMY, Political Advisor to H.E. Mr. Amre Moussa,
Minister of Foreign Affairs, Egypt</FONT>
<HR>

<P>
The Mediterranean is a region which has not acquired recognition
as a distinct security zone in its own right. This has been due
to a combination of factors, most important of which have been
that the exigencies of superpower rivalry and the Arab-Israeli
conflict have been superimposed on the security considerations
of Mediterranean states. The region has always been perceived
as an extension of other security zones, namely Europe within
the context of the east-west confrontation, and the Middle East
with both the Arab-Israeli conflict and superpower involvement.
<BR>

<P>
Throughout the cold war, European threat perceptions were frozen
around the east-west divide. Because of the military standoff
along the inter-German border, the states of Europe faced an acute
security environment that periodically deteriorated to the point
of crisis depending on the vicissitudes of US-Soviet rivalry.
This daunting threat perception fixated the national security
policies of Europe eastward, thus subordinating the security concerns
of other areas contiguous to Europe, namely the Mediterranean.
With the possible exception of France, that insisted on maintaining
a high security profile in Africa and the Pacific, Europe looked
to `out-of-area' security issues only through the prism of the
cold war. <BR>

<P>
Similarly, the perennial Arab-Israeli conflict ensured that the
priorities of Middle East states remained fixated on regional
concerns especially in times of crisis, or in the course of the
various peace initiatives floated during the 1980s, and later
on the priorities of Gulf security. Any attempt to look towards
the Mediterranean would inevitably have become entangled in the
complexities of Arab-Israeli relations, superpower involvement
in the region, and more recently, issues relating to the military
balance in the Gulf. <BR>

<P>
In recent years, a fundamental transformation in the security
environment of both regions has generated a host of security concerns
that have impacted strongly on both shores of the Mediterranean.
As a result, growing recognition now exists that these problems,
or at least some of them, must be tackled within a regional Mediterranean
context, distinct from, but not independently of, Europe and the
Middle East. <BR>

<P>
The retreat of the Soviet threat from the east altered the political
consensus regarding the security architecture on the continent.
On the other hand, the perceived threats which surfaced in the
Mediterranean prompted the southern European states to consider
multilateral schemes capable of dealing with a complex array of
new security issues. The interlocking complexity of the military,
demographic, socio-economic, religious, and political problems
which were brought to the fore, and the intensification of global
economic integration, compelled analysts to look towards the construction
of a security architecture founded upon a multi-dimensional approach,
which recognises the intricate linkages between these issues,
as opposed to the strict preoccupation with military security
that had previously characterised the European security agenda.
<BR>

<P>
This trend towards a Mediterranean approach was complemented by
the profound developments in the Middle East, in parallel with
the end of the cold war. The peace process initiated at Madrid
in October 1991 by no means brought an end to the preoccupation
of the region with the Palestine problem. However, the region
was on a course of irreversible change prompting Middle Eastern
states to reassess their foreign policy orientation. The Mediterranean
began to take on greater salience in the priorities of the North
African states, and again there was a recognition of the interlocking
nature of the security issues which must be dealt with. <BR>

<P>
The basic premise of this paper is that the dissipation of a central
threat and the recognition of the multi-dimensional complexity
of the security issues facing the states of the Mediterranean
and the Middle East, provided the auspicious environment and impetus
for the commencement of the dialogue initiated at Barcelona, which
can serve as a framework within which a more effective Mediterranean
security relationship can develop. The nature of the issues which
this dialogue will address are by no means exclusive to the region.
The specific socio-cultural and geographic context, however, will
manifest itself on both shores of the Mediterranean, requiring
both a regional, and intraregional approach to the issues. The
specificity and complexity of the emerging security environment
in the Mediterranean, therefore, will give the region, if not
a distinct homogeneous security identity, a uniquely complex identity
where nonmilitary dimensions of security carry at least as much
weight as traditional military concerns. <BR>

<P>
<B>The Emergence of a Mediterranean Approach<BR>
</B>
<P>
Since the end of the second world war, and the emergence of the
bipolar international structure, security in the Mediterranean
region was always perceived as an extension of the east-west standoff
that divided the European continent. This region was seen as a
perimeter where NATO was to ward off Soviet encroachment to the
alliance's southern flank, or as a platform from which the United
States could project its power into the Middle East by way of
its naval presence in the form of the US Sixth Fleet. The Mediterranean
was thus a pawn on the global chess board where regional security
concerns were subordinated to the strategic policies of the superpowers
and their allies. <BR>

<P>
The subordination of regional security concerns was clearly reflected
in the benign neglect which characterised the European approach
to the Mediterranean within Europe's security institutions. The
CSCE, as well as its contemporary permutations, has always embodied
a Mediterranean component. However, this was addressed with diplomatic
formality where form prevailed over substance more than was the
case with any other subsystem. As this developed, specialised
meetings with non-European Mediterranean states were held. At
a later stage, Mediterranean states were given a status below
that of observer, participating instead in their capacity as &quot;Non-Participating
Mediterranean States&quot; (NPMS). These meetings took place in
Valletta (1978), Venice (1984), Palma de Majorca (1990) and in
Valletta again in 1993. Mediterranean issues, however, were never
elevated to anything above the peripheral status within the CSCE's
agenda. Notwithstanding the decisions reached at the Budapest
summit in late 1994 to establish a contact group at the level
of experts within the framework of the OSCE Permanent Council
in Vienna, the Mediterranean remained little more than a marginal
area of concern for all members except the southern European states.
<BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>1. Euro-Arab Relations<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
Attempts at co-operation between Europe and the Arab world predate
even the early initiatives relating to Mediterranean security.
In 1965, Lebanon was the first state to conclude a three-year
trade agreement with the EC, followed by Egypt in 1972. In the
same year, the then nine member states of the EC responded to
a request made in 1971 by the European Parliament and started
to look into an overall Mediterranean policy that opened up prospects
for co-operation in several areas, an initiative that was referred
to as the &quot;Revised Mediterranean Policy&quot;. Consequently,
discussions with the three Maghreb countries (Algeria, Morocco,
Tunisia) began on that basis in 1973 leading to the conclusion
of agreements between the Community and each of the three states
in 1973. Egypt, Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan followed in 1976. The
co-operative agreements between the EC and the seven Arab Mediterranean
countries were almost identical in nature, focusing on trade preferences
and economic stabilisation, as well as financial and technical
co-operation embodied in a series of protocols of renewable five
year time periods.<BR>

<P>
These initiatives, however, were pursued and developed more within
a bilateral framework between the EC and each Arab Mediterranean
state. There was no serious effort to deal with the Mediterranean
countries together within a multilateral framework. Because of
the preoccupation of both the Arab and southern European states
with the Middle East and the east-west conflict respectively,
the notion of Mediterranean multilateralism never got off the
water. This was clearly reflected in the fate of the &quot;Euro-Arab
Dialogue&quot;. <BR>

<P>
Initiated in 1976, the dialogue was not meant to deal specifically
with Mediterranean issues but rather co-operation between European
and Arab states. However, if it had continued, it would inevitably
have come to embody a pronounced Mediterranean component given
the fact that the region constitutes the main area of geographical
contiguity between Europe and the Arab world. In addition to the
divergent security and political agendas of the parties involved,
the reasons behind the failure of the Euro-Arab dialogue were
also closely linked to the inter-regional divisions which emerged
in the Middle East following the signing of the Camp David Accords
and the outbreak of the Iran Iraq war, as well as differences
within the Atlantic Alliance over the approach which should be
adopted towards the region. The schism that emerged between Egypt
and the Arab states precluded a common Arab stand <I>vis-a-vis</I>
co-operation with Europe, and the lack of receptivity on the part
of the United States to an independent European security policy
in the Middle East diluted the enthusiasm with which the EC approached
the dialogue. The Euro-Arab dialogue thus remained frozen for
most of the 1980s, and after France attempted to revive the process
in December 1989, it was again stalled by the outbreak of the
Gulf crisis. <BR>

<P>
The main conclusion to be drawn from this phase is that the security
concerns of the Middle East and Europe - areas contiguous to but
not a part of the Mediterranean - impinged upon attempts to initiate
a security dialogue across the shores of the Mediterranean. In
essence, prospects for developing a distinct security identity
for the region remained captive to, even submerged by, strategic
developments emanating essentially from areas outside the Mediterranean
itself. <BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>2. Europe's Security Evolution<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
By the end of the 1980s, however, several regional and global
developments combined to gradually loosen the bonds between the
Mediterranean and Europe's security architecture to which it had
previously been so tightly bound, and from the Middle East to
which it was linked through the nexus of the Arab-Israeli conflict
and Persian Gulf oil. Divorcing Mediterranean security from strategic
developments in Europe and the Middle East would be inconceivable.
However, a host of security issues began to emerge, the impact
of which was felt most strongly in the regional Mediterranean
context. <BR>

<P>
The disintegration of the Soviet empire in Eastern Europe finally
brought an end to the standoff that had divided the continent
along the cease-fire lines of World War II. The breakup of the
communist bloc focused European attention mostly on the power
vacuum that emerged in the east, and profoundly altered the security
equation on the European continent as a whole. Inevitably therefore,
the European approach to Mediterranean security issues found a
niche in their concerns. The overarching but coherent Soviet threat
to western Europe was replaced by a host of more limited but equally
demanding security issues affecting different members of the western
alliance asymmetrically. The perceived threat of refugees and
economic dislocation in the east affected Germany much more than
the rest of the continent; the threat of migration from the southern
shores of the Mediterranean affected France and Spain much more
than it did, say, Britain or Germany; and the instability in the
Balkans triggered by the breakup of the Yugoslav Federation threatened
to spark a regional crisis that could suck in such countries as
Italy, Greece and Turkey. <BR>

<P>
The collective security institutions which had previously guaranteed
security on the continent against the Soviet threat failed to
deal decisively with this diverse array of security threats. Although
NATO finally stepped in to enforce the tenuous peace put together
in the Balkans, this was essentially a manifestation of American
leadership. It also remains to be seen whether the commitment
of the alliance will stand if the conflict flares up once again.

<P>
Similarly, it is difficult to conceive of either NATO or the WEU
intervening to stem the tide of refugees that threaten the states
of southern Europe. Unsettling question marks still hang over
NATO's nuclear umbrella now that the fragmentation of the Soviet
Union's nuclear arsenal impacts differently upon each country's
deterrent posture. Finally, the uncertainty surrounding such questions
is reinforced as growing isolationist sentiment in the United
States casts serious doubts on the sustainability of the American
commitment to Europe's defense.
<P>
The combined result of these factors is what several security
analysts have described as the 'renationalisation' of Europe's
security policy, meaning that security threats now impact more
forcefully on alliance members individually rather than on the
alliance as a whole. How this will impact on the overall security
structure in Europe, and thus the Mediterranean, still remains
to be seen. It is unlikely that this trend will lead to the demise
of either the NATO alliance or the European pillar embodied in
the WEU. However, the changing nature of the emerging security
threats on the continent, and the reassessment of Europe's security
institutions, has created an extremely fluid environment that
has opened up a greater margin of maneuver for European states.
This can be discerned in several significant developments with
regards to the security policies of individual alliance members:
Germany's unilateral recognition of Croatia and Slovenia immediately
following the dissolution of the Yugoslav Federation; the independent
stand taken by Greece on the issue of Macedonia; the important
steps taken so far with regards to closer Franco-German security
co-operation; and the initiative taken by Italy and Spain, followed
by France, towards closer Mediterranean co-operation beginning
in 1990.<BR>

<P>
The Spanish-Italian initiative proposed the creation of a CSCE-type
framework for the Mediterranean - hence its formal title, `The
Conference on Co-operation and Security in the Mediterranean'
(CSCM). The Non-Aligned Mediterranean states had already expressed
their support for such a proposal in June 1990 thus paving the
way for Spain and Italy to present a joint non-paper on a CSCM
to the Palma de Majorca CSCE meeting on 24 September 1990. The
non-paper recognised the serious demographic and economic imbalances
existing in the area and their adverse social and cultural consequences.
The CSCM was conceptualised as constituting a joint instrument
the purpose of which was to ward off a potential collision between
the southern and northern shores of the Mediterranean in what
was becoming a new frontier of Europe. <BR>

<P>
The CSCM proposal, however, met with little support by the CSCE
participants, especially France, which criticised the initiative
on the basis of its inapplicability to such a vast and diverse
area as the Mediterranean. The French argument - later developed
into the 5+5 process - stressed that a CSCM like framework must
start with a `core' group of states comprised of the five Maghreb
states (Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Libya and Mauritania) and the
five European Mediterranean countries (Spain, France, Italy, Portugal
and Malta). A meeting at the level of Foreign Ministers was held
in Rome on December 10, 1990, in which Malta was granted the status
of an &quot;associate participant&quot; but was soon given the
status of full participant the following year during the second
Ministerial meeting held in Algiers in October 1991. <BR>

<P>
Thus, by the turn of the decade, the fundamental changes in Europe's
security environment combined to prompt the first stirrings of
a southern European approach towards the Mediterranean within
a multilateral framework. The fragmentation of the Soviet empire
brought with it a reassessment of threat perceptions of Europe's
major actors that consequently generated a state of flux with
regards to the overall security architecture on the continent.
This prompted the states of southern Europe to embark on a number
of initiatives that sought to focus attention on the Mediterranean
basin within some sort of grouping bringing together the states
of the region. 
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>3. The Middle East Security Evolution<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
A similar trend can be discerned with regards to developments
in the Middle East. The significant steps taken towards resolving
the Arab-Israeli conflict, and especially the Palestinian issue,
have led to a profound reassessment on the part of Middle Eastern
states with regards to their regional policies. This development
has diluted the exclusive preoccupation of Middle Eastern states
with the Arab-Israeli conflict, and the nuances of their position
towards Israel. As progress was witnessed in the peace talks,
Arab states began to look beyond the confines of the region for
outlets of manoeuver in order to augment their regional position.
<BR>

<P>
Egypt in particular looked to the Mediterranean area and Europe
in order to secure markets for its exports and ensure an alternative
supply of high technology. Egypt's motives in this regard were
also influenced by a profound recognition that a dangerous north-south
schism was developing across the Mediterranean basin due to the
economic and demographic imbalances between the North African
and southern European states. These imbalances have also taken
on religious overtones that are threatening to transform this
schism into a cultural antagonism dividing both shores of the
Mediterranean. Egypt's Mediterranean Forum proposal presented
in April 1991 at the European Parliament in Strasbourg was based
on the necessity of instituting some sort of political and cultural
dialogue to ameliorate what could potentially develop into a volatile
security situation. <BR>

<P>
In short, the regional transformations witnessed by both Europe
and the Middle East after the end of the cold war profoundly altered
the security situation of the Mediterranean countries and permitted
the development of a nascent security approach towards the area.
The problems that began to emerge in the Mediterranean area could
no longer be thought of as simply an appendage of the security
concerns of the NATO alliance. Similarly, the North African states
saw that these problems were not all predominantly linked to the
Arab-Israeli conflict. <BR>

<P>
Again it is important to emphasise that this does not imply that
Mediterranean issues can be decoupled from the wider security
zones of either Europe or the Middle East. Alliance concerns and
conflicts in Europe and the Middle East will continue to impinge
on Mediterranean security, and will inevitably influence the ultimate
security architecture which prevails in the area. However, the
diverse cultural and religious context in which the security issues
of the area are unfolding, makes it inconceivable to perceive
them as simply an extension of NATO's southern defense perimeter,
or in attempting to view them through the prism of the Arab-Israeli
conflict. <BR>

<P>
If not addressed appropriately, this new breed of security threats
faced by the Mediterranean will become daunting. The threat of
massive migration from the south to the north; the danger of economic
dislocation leading to social disruptions and consequently to
ethnic strife and religious xenophobia; the growing economic rift
between north and south as the process of European integration
deepens; and the threat of weapons proliferation along the southern
Mediterranean rim, have all become familiar themes in the security
literature dealing with the area, and there is consequently little
need to elaborate upon them here. <BR>

<P>
What is perhaps less well known, but no less important in explaining
the current changes in the region, is the impact of global economic
and technological forces in intensifying these dislocations. I
refer specifically to the advent of the information revolution,
the impact of which on the current global economic, cultural,
and social order will be nothing less than profound. The social
and political consequences of the current technological revolution
are daunting in their complexity and, consequently, are not yet
fully understood.<BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>4. The Social Consequences of the Technological
Revolution<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
In a strictly technical sense, the information revolution refers
to the merger between communications and computer technology thereby
greatly augmenting the ability to process, store, and disseminate
information. However, the significance of this revolution lies
not so much in the technology but in its remarkable ability to
compress time and space, thereby fundamentally altering the nature
of social activity once it is transferred to the information network.
When the forces of the market merge with the information revolution
through the ever expanding network, business organisations will
expand their reach to a degree unprecedented in magnitude or scope,
allowing business operations to be conducted on a global scale.
<BR>

<P>
This remarkable ability to transcend the traditional confines
of time and space is what gives information technology its incredible
power. This power, in turn, gives it the ability to erode the
barriers that obstruct the free flow of information, including
the nation state itself. <BR>

<P>
Wealth and competitive advantage in information economies lie
in sophisticated information handling rather than in the ownership
or management of capital. This has led to the rise of a nascent
class that US Secretary of Labor Robert Reich termed 'symbols
analysts' - a class of professionals who thrive on the network
by manipulating digital information. Because the network has no
physical location, and because the global reach of business reduces
the dependence of the economy on the nation state, this class
becomes disembodied of its national loyalties. The nation state
itself becomes less and less capable of regulating the economy,
and therefore sustaining the extensive welfare system that underpinned
the social order and guaranteed loyalty to the state. Since work
in the information economy depends on the requisite education
and training, an ever larger sector of the population becomes
economically marginalised. <BR>

<P>
The trend which emerges from this development is one of an ever
greater concentration of wealth in the hands of those who no longer
depend on the state to sustain their economic activity, leaving
behind an impoverished underclass which cannot hope to compete
in such a demanding environment. Caught in between is the middle
class of managers and high income workers. Those who manage to
acquire the requisite skills will be elevated to the ranks of
the symbols analysts that run the economy, those that do not will
join the ranks of the underemployed facing the persistent threat
of job insecurity. <BR>

<P>
The middle class has always constituted the bulwark of loyalty
for the nation state. As its position is undermined, however,
other loyalties begin to supersede the ideology of secular nationalism.
Primordial loyalties based on ethnicity, race or communal affiliation
take its place for that strata of society which has been marginalised
by the fast-paced economy, while a kind of cosmopolitan `supranationalism'
captivates those who live and work on the network. The nation
state thus becomes undermined by the dual pressures of the rise
of subnational loyalties from below, and the secession of the
economic elite from above. <BR>

<P>
This trend is reinforced by the social and cultural consequences
that accompany the spread of information technologies. One of
the hallmarks of the information revolution is its incredible
ability to propagate and disseminate images. This power is now
being harnessed by business organisations so that market advantage
is now dependent on packaging and repackaging products in images
and icons with a distinctly American quality. What is actually
marketed, therefore, is not the product itself, but images reflecting
the rise of `soft' industries based on entertainment, advertising,
media and information services that are woven together to create
a kind of global theme park reflecting cosmopolitan American life
style and values. This development, however, constitutes an incredibly
powerful cultural force that often assaults the indigenous value
systems that it hopes to integrate into the global market. <BR>

<P>
This, in turn, inevitably generates a cultural backlash that seeks
to emphasise religious and cultural identity as a form of psychological
reassurance against the cultural assault of - in this case - western
materialism. This backlash is by no means exclusive to Arab or
Third World cultures as is evidenced by the rise of conservative
sentiment that has shifted the political spectrum rightwards in
such countries as the United States, Germany, France and Great
Britain that has been accompanied with a strong nationalistic
and xenophobic flavor. What serves to exacerbate this trend towards
cultural and religious xenophobia is the transparency that comes
with the communications revolution. Because of its remarkable
ability to compress time and space, the information revolution
significantly contracts the socio-cultural space that previously
insulated separate social groups.<BR>

<P>
How these powerful trends will affect the political and security
situation in the Mediterranean cannot yet be discerned with any.
However, one can attempt to establish a tentative link between
these developments and the general socio-cultural trends witnessed
by communities on both shores of the Mediterranean. One only has
to look at the recent election results in such countries as Italy,
France, Greece, and Turkey to notice a gradual shift of the political
spectrum towards the right. Similarly, the creeping tide of cultural
and religious conservatism in North Africa threatens to open up
a north-south cultural rift across the Mediterranean. The economic
imbalances caused by the intensification of market forces inevitably
reinforce this trend. The disparities in wealth both within Mediterranean
countries, and between the European and North African flanks of
the region, are undermining the social pillars of support that
sustained the secular national order. What this inevitably generates
is a creeping cultural radicalism that leads to the rejection
of the `other' however defined. Not only does this xenophobic
trend serve to solidify the cultural divide emerging across the
Mediterranean, but also threatens to spill over onto both shores
with every incident of communal violence against foreigners or
immigrant workers. <BR>

<P>
Security, in this sense, therefore tends to take on an abstract
quality intertwined with the complexities of social and political
interaction in the information age. No longer can security be
gauged in strictly military terms. Security must be based on a
multidimensional approach in order to be able to cope with this
new breed of threats which are specific, although not exclusive
to, the Mediterranean area. It is this recognition on the part
of Mediterranean states in the particularity of the security threats
they face that is giving rise to the notion of a distinctly `Mediterranean'
security regime based on dialogue and a multidimensional security
approach, regardless of the fact that this regime is still in
its preliminary stages. <BR>

<P>
How these issues will be tackled, however, will depend on the
ultimate security framework that emerges for the area as a whole.
Recognition of the complex multi-faceted nature of the security
threats facing Mediterranean states, in and of itself, will not
be sufficient to ensure that they will be successfully addressed.
This will depend to a large extent on how the multiple security
interests in the region are reconciled making the process of institution
building in the Mediterranean a complex exercise in balancing
the competing frameworks put forward for the security of the region,
including the influence of extra-regional parties.<BR>

<P>
<B>Reconciling the Overlapping Interests in the Mediterranean
<BR>
</B>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>1. Managing the European-Mediterranean Linkage
<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
As was mentioned in the introduction to this paper, the state
of flux that characterised Europe's security architecture after
the cold war opened the door for the recognition of Mediterranean
security concerns as one among several competing areas of priority
that must be addressed. What this signifies is not the detachment
of the area from Europe, but that the current security debate
on the continent now must encompass security concerns that directly
relate to the Mediterranean. <BR>

<P>
Europe's ultimate security structure will be decided according
to how it manages to reconcile the competing Atlantic, European,
and inter-European visions for European security. It would be
a misperception to think that this linkage with European security
will subjugate the Mediterranean to purely European and American
concerns. The nature of the security threats in the region, and
the recognition of the need for a multilateral approach to address
them, precludes this possibility. However, it would be impossible
to formulate a viable security framework for the area unless the
interests of the various actors in Europe, and even the United
States, are taken into account and loosely or informally integrated
into an institutional framework in which they can complement,
rather than compete with, each other.
<P>
Managing this linkage, however, will be a difficult task even
if we restrict ourselves to the traditional military dimension
of security. The latent tension between the national security
interests of NATO members and the collective security commitments
of the alliance has always been most pronounced in the Mediterranean.
This explains why NATO was never able to incorporate the area
within its integrated defence structure, and instead relied on
the US naval presence to ward off Soviet encroachment on the southern
defence perimeter of the alliance. The region thus remained as
a `gray zone' within the alliance's defence structure in which
the question of whether the US naval force served purely American
or alliance interests was never quite defined. <BR>

<P>
This ambiguity that has characterised the position of the Mediterranean
within alliance politics will have a profound impact on the ultimate
security approach adopted for the region. Also important will
be the issue of the competing `European' and `Atlantic' visions
for European security. The current emphasis on greater burden-sharing
within NATO by strengthening the alliance's European pillar is
only one facet of the issue. Equally important is whether the
WEU will be integrated into NATO's defence structure, or whether
it will constitute the military arm of a strengthened EU once
the differences on formulating agreement on a common foreign and
security policy are resolved. <BR>

<P>
If Europe fails to resolve the Atlantic-European tension in its
security policy, then the present arrangement within NATO guaranteeing
American preeminence within alliance affairs will likely prevail.
In that event, if European security policy towards the Mediterranean
continues to be formulated within the NATO framework, the resulting
approach is not likely to constitute a viable multilateral formula
for the area. 
<P>
Like other institutions of the cold war, NATO has always regarded
the region with little more than marginal concern, a fact evidenced
by the initiatives taken by the alliance towards the area following
the end of the cold war. As was the case with the CSCE, NATO undertook
several declaratory steps towards closer co-operation with Mediterranean
countries. In their declaration issued in Brussels on January
11, 1994, the Heads of State and Government of NATO reiterated
their &quot;conviction that security in Europe is greatly affected
by security in the Mediterranean&quot;. They strongly welcomed
the agreements concluded within the framework of the Middle East
peace process and regarded this &quot;much awaited&quot; breakthrough
as having a positive impact on the situation in the Mediterranean.
They subsequently directed the North Atlantic Co-operation Council
(NACC) to continue to review the overall situation in the region,
and encouraged all efforts conducive to strengthening regional
stability. <BR>

<P>
This was followed, in December 1994, by the initiative of the
NATO Foreign Ministers to open a dialogue between the alliance
and the non-NATO Mediterranean states. Within this framework,
NATO invited Egypt, Israel, Morocco, Tunisia, and Mauritania to
study their views concerning stability in the Mediterranean and
prospects for possible co-operation with the alliance. NATO's
initiatives, however, did not seek to establish any institutional
linkages between the alliance and these states, nor did they envisage
what type of linkage would exist between the Mediterranean and
Europe as a whole. <BR>

<P>
More serious perhaps than the absence of any institutional framework
for the NATO initiatives are the possibly adverse consequences
resulting from the maintenance of the US naval deployment in the
Mediterranean without a multilateral framework governing its presence.
As Roberto Aliboni has perceptively pointed out, &quot;the national
dimension of the US naval presence in the Mediterranean could
prevail over its multilateral dimension.&quot; European naval
deployment in the area could also have a similar effect. The fact
that a predominantly American - European military presence in
the area operates without a multilateral cover could heighten
concerns on the part of some southern Mediterranean states regarding
US and European intentions. Security issues in the region, therefore,
would be regarded in terms of deterrable events that can be addressed
through military force without recognition of their cultural and
socio-economic root causes. The current north-south divide would
thus become militarised, cementing the division of the region
into two antagonistic blocs that would accentuate the trend towards
cultural xenophobia that is emerging on both sides of the Mediterranean.
<BR>

<P>
If, however, the European pillar of the alliance is strengthened
and integrated into NATO's defence structure, one can expect a
more pronounced European role in Mediterranean security. This
would also be the case if the WEU were to emerge as the military
arm of an EU that would gradually assume more responsibility for
the continent's defence, although this scenario remains problematic
given the difficulties that plague such matters as formulating
a collective nuclear umbrella and an integrated command structure.
In both cases, however, the strength of Europe's commitment to
a Mediterranean outlook would depend on how the foreign policy
priorities of the major European states are reconciled; in particular
between Germany's eastward focus on the countries of the former
Soviet bloc, and France's southern foreign policy orientation.
<BR>

<P>
However these competing priorities are reconciled, this would
still leave the issue of the American role and military presence
in the region undefined. A more prominent European security profile
does not automatically mean an end to the US military presence
in the area, nor even its reduction. What it will imply, however,
is the dominance of US national security concerns over whatever
collective commitments it may have considered within the NATO
alliance. Any Mediterranean multilateral framework, therefore,
must somehow accommodate American interests in order to ward off
what could develop into a serious competition for influence that
could have destabilising consequences in the form of a regional
arms race.<BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>2. The Madrid Process and Mediterranean Security
<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
The process begu at Madrid has set in motion a loose but comprehensive
framework for Middle East dialogue and co-operation that has the
potential to extend to the Mediterranean. As was demonstrated
during the 1980s, developments in the Middle East region cast
a powerful shadow on wider Mediterranean concerns which become
entangled in such issues as relations with Israel, the regional
arms race, and the latent competition between the United States
and Europe for influence in the region. 
<P>
The Madrid process seeks to disentangle such issues in order to
enhance co-operation between the states of the region. This does
not mean that the multilateral tracks can proceed in isolation
of progress on the bilateral negotiations. The 'Multilateral track'
has been divided into five working groups that are separate but
with an implicit linkage between them as well as between this
track and the bilateral - conflict resolution - tracks of the
peace process.<BR>

<P>
Provided that this issue of linkage is handled carefully, together
with other sensitive issues such as the current military imbalance
between Israel and the Arab states, and Israel's nuclear posture,
the multilateral track can constitute a framework around which
co-operation can emerge and spin off with a positive southern
Mediterranean contribution to the Mediterranean security debate.
<BR>

<P>
This is particularly true for the ACRS track. The Arms Control
and Regional Working Group (ACRS) has, in many ways, informally
emulated the cooperative security model applied in Europe in developing
its work. During the first phase of ACRS, regional parties were
introduced to the modalities and procedures that guided the CSCE
and the US-Soviet arms control experience. In the third ACRS plenary
meeting held in Washington in May 1993, it was agreed that the
parties would consider a number of CSCE-like CBMs. Such CBMs included
the exchange of military information, risk reduction measures,
and agreements on measures to prevent incidents at sea (INCSEA)
and to cooperate in search and rescue maritime missions (SAR).
<BR>

<P>
It was also agreed in Washington that parties would hold intersessional
activities, each entrusted with a specific assignment. Mentor
states were nominated from outside the Middle East to assist regional
states in four main domains; <BR>

<P>
- The United States and the Russian Federation were to guide efforts
to define the ultimate objectives of ACRS and to help parties
on a set of declaratory CBMs and the principles of the security
process;<BR>

<P>
- Canada was to assist efforts on maritime CBMs and means of preventing
incidents at sea;<BR>

<P>
- Turkey was to assist efforts to explore alternative means of
exchanging military information and prenotification of military
exercises and large-scale movements;<BR>

<P>
- The Netherlands was to assist in efforts to establish a regional
crisis communications network in the Middle East. Again following
the European experience, agreement was reached in Moscow to divide
the future intersessional activities of ACRS into two main baskets.
The Conceptual Basket was to include all conceptual aspects of
the process while the Operational Basket mainly dealt with practical
mechanisms to increase military transparency and reduce dangers
of unintended military escalation. Particularly noteworthy in
this regard is that the conceptual basket - albeit without success
so far - has attempted to develop a Regional Security and Arms
Control Declaration for the Middle East, encompassing principles,
parameters and objectives. 
<P>
ACRS has continued for over three years to deal with an extensive
agenda aiming at the creation of a new Middle East security environment.
However, after the April 1995 Review/ Extension Conference of
the NPT, with Arab-Israeli differences resulting from Israel's
refusal to accede to the treaty or to negotiate a Nuclear Weapons
Free Zone in the Middle East, ACRS activities have subsided. The
ACRS process thus became hostage to Israel agreeing to deal constructively
and structurally with the nuclear issue. The failure of the ACRS
members to adopt the Declaration on Regional Security and Arms
Control came as a direct result of Israel's failing to agree to
commit to adhere to the Non-Proliferation Treaty even in the future.
<BR>

<P>
This was clearly evidenced after the sixth ACRS plenary held in
Tunis, which made several recommendations including the possible
working out of a mandate for a Regional Security Center (RSC)
in the Middle East. In Jordan, Tunis and Qatar pursuant to that
meeting no agreement was reached concerning the RSC document due
to Egypt's insistence on the creation of some type of linkage
between the functions of the RSC and the establishment of a NWFZ
in the region, rather than being limited in its activity to the
classical conflict prevention domain.<BR>

<P>
Two things are important to note in the work of the ACRS working
group. First, the activities of the working group are only one
dimension of a matrix of five covered by the multilateral working
groups on Water, Environment, Refugees, Economic Co-operation
and Arms Control, which together exemplify the multidimensional
approach that could form the basis for wider security co-operation
encompassing the Mediterranean area. This, however, will depend
on the delicate link which exists between the process of institutionalising
CBMs in the Middle East and the issue of Israel's nuclear position.
The question of Israel's nuclear posture, and the issue of the
linkage between the multilateral and bilateral tracks, point to
the second, and perhaps more important aspect. The involvement
of several European actors in the activities of ACRS means that
the sensitivity of the issues discussed will clearly have an impact
on any Mediterranean multilateral framework combining Europe and
the non-European Mediterranean states, a fact which was clearly
emphasised at Barcelona.<BR>

Framework<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
The historic meeting which took place in Barcelona in November
of last year reflected the change in perceptions regarding the
security of the Mediterranean region. The issue of whether regional
security would be addressed within a strictly Mediterranean context
envisioned in the '5+5' initiative, the CSCM, or the Mediterranean
Forum, a wider framework encompassing European security concerns,
was finally resolved in the form of a Euro-Mediterranean conference.
Whether such a framework will survive to constitute a viable security
regime for the area is not yet clear, and will ultimately depend
on both the final security architecture which emerges in Europe,
and the course of the Madrid peace process in the Middle East.
The Declaration adopted at Barcelona exemplified the multidimensional
approach to security that recognises the deep-rooted linkages
between security and economic and social development, as was evidenced
in the references throughout the text to the common' challenges
necessitating a common security approach. Also apparent was the
recognition of the non-military dimension of security in the form
of demographic dislocation causing current migration flows. Although
not mentioned within the security chapter, there was implicit
recognition that such an issue has obvious security implications.
<BR>

<P>
This does not mean, however, that differences do not exist. In
particular potential differences may emerge in the various conceptions
regarding such basic principles as democracy and human rights.
The only way that such differences will be resolved is through
a cultural dialogue to reconcile the contending interpretations
surrounding these concepts. Another divisive issue could emerge
with regards to the treatment of migrant workers, and especially
the policy of the European states which admit the possibility
of the return of illegal migrant workers to their countries of
origin. What needs to be recognised is that whatever policy is
adopted in this regard will carry with it profound social consequences
that will inevitably have ramifications on other areas of European-Mediterranean
co-operation. In addition to this heightened cultural dimension
of Euro-Mediterranean relations, there will also be the problem
of politicising such thorny issues such as `self-determination'.
This will inevitably cause differences when applied to issues
such as the Cypriot question, the Balkans, and above all the Middle
East with regards to Palestine. <BR>

<P>
This last point avidly portrays the overlap between the Middle
East and the Mediterranean, an overlap that and which was most
apparent in the security chapter of the Barcelona Declaration
which highlighted a host of security issues that have a special
relevance to the Middle East. These included such issues as arms
control and the regional arms race, especially the reference to
the creation of a `Middle East' zone free of weapons of mass destruction
and their delivery systems, and the reference to the possibility
of `regional and sub-regional security co-operation'. What clearly
demonstrated the overlap between the two regions, however, was
the exchange at the Barcelona conference between the Syrian and
Israeli Foreign Ministers that dominated a substantial portion
of the meeting. That a Middle Eastern issue could impinge so forcefully
on a forum designed to discuss Mediterranean co-operation is testimony
to the strength of the linkage between both regions. <BR>

<P>
It is therefore these linkages that will decide how the multidimensional
security approach on which a tentative consensus was reached at
Barcelona will be addressed. What Barcelona managed to achieve
was the formulation of a broad proposal for co-operation grounded
in a firm recognition of the non-military aspects of security.
What was thus envisaged was a functional approach encompassing
such areas as investment, the environment, tourism, information
technology and telecommunications, fisheries, and transport to
name only a few. This broad framework is supposed to take concrete
form in the follow up meetings. <BR>

<P>
However, this will depend on whether the Euro-Mediterranean framework
envisaged in Barcelona can be transformed into a viable security
regime for the region. As was already mentioned, the fate of this
broad cooperative framework will be intimately linked to the course
of the Euro-Mediterranean process as a whole. If the Barcelona
framework manages to reconcile the contending visions within the
EU for European security, and is complemented by a stable peace
process in the Middle East, then the prospects for the development
of a cooperative security regime are positive. If, however, the
Barcelona process fails to develop into a viable framework capable
of filling the institutional vacuum in the Mediterranean, then
the cooperative schemes envisaged for the region will suffer the
fate of the previous Mediterranean initiatives that failed to
reconcile the competing interests of the multiplicity of actors
involved.<BR>

<P>
<B>Conclusion: Towards a Flexible Institutional Framework<BR>
</B>
<P>
By a historical coincidence that is rare in modern history, the
countries of Europe and the Middle East have found themselves
looking towards each other across the Mediterranean, both cognisant
of the pressing need to institute some sort of cultural and security
dialogue in order to prevent the emergence of a cultural rift
between them. 
<P>
The true significance of the end of the bipolar international
order lies in the fact that the intersecting geopolitical and
cultural zones that were hitherto sucked into the vortex of superpower
rivalry are now open to the emergence of new power centers and
cooperative interaction. This phenomenon of greater regionalisation
of international relations is clearly exhibited in such areas
as eastern Europe that is now open to the spread of German influence,
Southeast Asia that is gradually emerging as an economic zone
tied to the powerful Japanese economy, a North American zone under
the hegemony of the United States, and the Mediterranean area
between Europe and the Middle East. <BR>

<P>
The rise of regionalism is being fuelled by the confluence of
several factors, only one of which is the waning of superpower
dominance. More important perhaps is the emergence of a new breed
of security threat that defies the traditional approach to security
as defined in military terms. The illusory semblance of stability
maintained by both superpowers in their respective spheres of
influence ensured that latent geopolitical and socio-cultural
tensions remained hidden from the view of policy makers, waiting
to resurface once the power structures constructed by Washington
and Moscow began to erode. The predominant characteristic of this
new type of threat is the intricate complexity of the issues it
poses, a complexity which will increase as the awesome power of
the technological revolution breaks down the traditional barriers
that had limited the scope of communal, social and political interaction.
<BR>

<P>
Complex security threats cannot be segmented into separate military
and non-military solutions. Rather, they must be faced by a sophisticated
approach that recognises this deep-seated complexity. The states
bordering on the Mediterranean have clearly recognised the need
of adopting such an approach within a multilateral regional framework.
Both sides have had prior experience in this regard: Europe within
the context of the OSCE, and the Middle East with the fragile
experiment at multilateral co-operation now being undertaken.

<P>
Consequently, both sides accept the reality that the security
challenges they now face are making themselves felt most strongly
in the regional Mediterranean context, and therefore require an
approach tailored to the specific cultural and political context
of the region. One can therefore expect that the strategic and
cultural changes that have lead to the renewal of interest in
the Mediterranean, will prompt a more intensified form of cultural
dialogue between both sides. This does not mean that military
security will be unimportant. However, military manifestations
of conflict are symptoms of much deeper causes not all of which
are under the purview of governments. <BR>

<P>
Cultural dialogue must therefore be complemented by a multilateral
security framework, within which it must be conducted. Such a
framework is essential if the various strategic interests of the
regional and extra-regional actors are to be reconciled. This
does not necessitate the creation of an all-inclusive forum in
which the security structure of the region is defined in detail.
This type of framework would be too rigid and cumbersome to deal
with the fluid security situation that is emerging in the Mediterranean.
<BR>

<P>
What can be considered instead, at least for the meantime, is
a complementary arrangement that may even include several frameworks
operating in tandem. In this sense, the various fora put forward
for the region do not have to be seen as mutually exclusive. Depending
on the nature of the issue being discussed, different frameworks
can operate, thus including different combinations of actors according
to the situation. For example, issues such as migration and the
environment can be handled within the context of The Mediterranean
Forum; cultural exchange and religious dialogue can be included
within the Euro-Mediterranean framework initiated at Barcelona;
and wider security concerns can be somehow linked to either NATO
or the Trans-Atlantic Charter so as to bring in the United States.
<BR>

<P>
Until such a flexible framework is developed, the efforts of the
Mediterranean states should focus on two possible areas of action.
The first is the need to continue to work on developing a consensus
on the issues put forward at Barcelona. Consensus on such sensitive
issues as human rights, democracy, self-determination, religious
tolerance, together with the initiation of economic and financial
co-operation between the Mediterranean states, can constitute
a first step towards generating agreement on a wider multilateral
framework. What is essential to keep in mind is the necessity
of developing some sort of political framework that will fill
the institutional void in the Mediterranean. This point is crucial.
If no such framework is developed, informal approaches can quickly
become politicised and exacerbate contentious issues rather than
fostering co-operation. <BR>

<P>
This leads to the second area of priority. Consensus building
on the ultimate security framework for the region will be a difficult
and time consuming process. In the meantime, incremental steps
must be taken to avoid potentially contentious areas such as migration,
arms proliferation - especially the issue of nuclear possession
- and terrorism, from hindering the process of consensus building.
Measures on a case-by-case basis that would attempt to prevent
the escalation of differences into conflicts cannot stand by themselves
and could end up legitimising the unacceptable status quo for
a temporary period. On the other hand, measures meant to prevent
the exacerbation of thorny issues by taking concrete if modest
steps towards an ultimate objective should be pursued and could
be useful. As was graphically demonstrated by the recent events
in the Middle East, minor events can spiral out of control and
seriously undermine the painstakingly constructed peace process
despite the political commitment of all the parties involved to
its continuation.<BR>

<B>THE BARCELONA DECLARATION: A PARTNERSHIP LOOKING FOR IMPLEMENTATION
AND IMPROVEMENT<BR>
<BR>
</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Smail HAMDANI, Principal Consultant, <I>Institut
National d'Etudes de Strat&eacute;gie Globale</I>, Algiers</FONT>
<HR>

<P>
Let me, first of all, thank Mr. Alberto Bin and the staff of the
Mediterranean Academy of Diplomatic Studies in Malta, for the
invitation to take part in this colloquium, on co-operation and
security in the Mediterranean, and especially on the prospects
after Barcelona.<BR>

<P>
If, the Barcelona meeting last November was a governmental one,
our gathering today is between private persons. This means, that
the plenipotentiaries in Barcelona were bound, at least in principle,
to defend the point of view of their government and the interests
of their own countries; it's their duty to do so. Conversely,
in our meeting today, whether from the North or the South shore,
we are free of this obligation and we can and must have a certain
vision of the future of the Mediterranean region as a whole.<BR>

<P>
Nevertheless, we cannot say that this document met the requirements
and hopes of the people of the South shore, while it met very
much more those of the North, even if in its appearance and form,
it seems to be equal to both sides.<BR>

<P>
It would take too long to comment on and detail each point of
the Declaration, but we may have a certain reading together. For
the first time in the history of our region, something serious
had begun. For the first time, 15 European countries, including
10 not directly Mediterranean but linked to the area, and 12 Mediterranean,
non-members of the European Union, started to establish a global
Euro-Mediterranean partnership.<BR>

<P>
We must say that the mere meeting in Barcelona and its issues,
is, in itself a very positive step. We must also remember that,
for more than two decades similar attempts to meet, dialogue and
agree, between those we generally call developed countries or
the North and the developing countries or the South, had not succeeded.
<BR>

<P>
It is the hope of all the members to see the implementation of
the decisions taken in Barcelona. It is also the hope of the people
of the South, and maybe their dream too, to see the partnership
as decided last November seriously improved.<BR>

<P>
We should wipe out the perception of many observers from the South
who see that the draft Declaration was shaped by the Europeans,
much more for themselves and in a subsidiary manner for the others.
<BR>

<P>
The common space of peace and stability should be framed by equal
partners through a real political dialogue. Our common security
cannot be divided; the regional security, contrary to yesterday's
confrontation between West and East, is not to substitute South
for East. It lies in a real balance of a dense network of interests,
in an understanding between all our peoples with no one excluded.
In short, it lies in a real and global partnership. Security will
not be ensured by military means or common manoeuvres.
<P>
The chapter related to the economic and financial partnership
stresses, in its first paragraph, the necessity of a lasting and
balanced economic and social development in order to build an
area of shared prosperity. Yet, in the following paragraph, the
Declaration dismisses the debt problem. <BR>

<P>
A real partnership seems to me very difficult to establish while
this problem and in general the question of financial relations
between the North and the South remain unsettled; in other words,
can a partnership, in the equal benefit of both parties, be built
between a &quot;heavy&quot; creditor and his debtor. <BR>

<P>
In the light of this, let's examine the situation of Algeria,
without hiding the responsibility of the national authorities
in the question of the external debt, we cannot also forget the
foreign liability in this matter, as far as the origin of the
debt or its management, are concerned.<BR>

<P>
The brutal fall of the oil price in 86 and of the US dollar (the
account currency), put Algeria in a very difficult situation which
leaded to serious turmoil. Managing its debt, Algeria had to pay
for the period of 3 years, 91, 92 and 93 an amount of 28 billions
$ and received for the same period 19 billions $ of credits (inflow)
with a debt stock of 26 billions $, which meant a net outflow
of 9 billions $ to the creditors, namely 3 billions $ per year,
and the debt of 26 billions $ is still the same; so, you always
have to pay without hope of putting an end to this sea-serpent.
<BR>

<P>
As a consequence of that, in 93, as an example, the country had
to reduce the imports to half of the 85's level, while the population
had grown and the social demand had risen. Besides that, you lose
your ability to negotiate better conditions for your imports;
you pay a higher price for the goods you buy, while the oil price,
the main export product, is at the level it was before 1973. An
exhausting situation with high losses.
<P>
The creditors advised the authorities to make an agreement with
the I.M.F. and reschedule the debt with the so-called Paris Club
and London Club even though one knows that no other country had
settled its debt problem through a rescheduling, in 94 Algeria
was compelled to resort to rescheduling its foreign debt.<BR>

<P>
As a result, the ratio of the debt service went down from 86%
of the exports in 93 to 48.7% in 94 and to 43.1% in 95, and the
debt stock rose from 26 to more than $. 32 billion.<BR>

<P>
This gave some financial ease but it was not sufficient to allow
a real take off of economic development: a normal debt service
should not exceed 25% of exports.<BR>

<P>
The financial &quot;assistance&quot; afforded by E.U. does not
give an adequate solution, the debt trap remains, and you have
to pay again and again.<BR>

<P>
Out of the debt question and out of the tariffs and customs, a
free trade area has other requirements, such as, among other things,
acquiring technology, spreading training and education, mastering
management and know-how, in order to ensure a competitive position
with partners.<BR>

<P>
A free trade area implies better conditions of equal competition,
or at least a competition not too unequal, a competition where
you give and take. Otherwise, it would lead to exploitation, frustration,
and even confrontation.<BR>

<P>
By the way, I would like to say here that I don't agree with the
last statement made in Paris on the 13/2/96 by Sir Leon Brittan
Vice-President of the European Commission who said:
<P>
&quot;It's time to adopt an offensive strategy in favour of opening
markets which are needed by the French economy and in general
by the whole of Europe&quot;. <BR>

<P>
When you read the development on the social, cultural and human
partnership, you're struck by the generous ideas expressed in
the Barcelona Declaration. Despite the mention of some &quot;selfish&quot;
preoccupation, the text is, in itself, of a high level, and we
may say: &quot;there is nothing to add, just put it into practice&quot;.
<BR>

<P>
However, it seems to me important to clarify and improve this
praiseworthy text in some of its aspects:<BR>

<P>
1- Social and cultural development are intimately linked to economic
development;<BR>

<P>
2- Security, democracy, human rights, birth control etc. cannot
be based on poverty. Such achievements can be reached only by
a society with a large middle class; <BR>

<P>
3- As far as the emigration question is concerned, we should,
in my opinion, state some principles and rules:<BR>

<P>
a) the right answer to the unemployment problem does not lie in
emigration but in domestic development. In this regard, Algeria
had in 1973 unilaterally put an end to the policy of emigration.
<BR>

<OL>
<LI>legally established immigrants should be protected; their
protection must be considered as part of human rights. 
</OL>

<P>
c) in this connection, the question of emigrants should not be
used as a wager in a gamble or a kind of punch bag, especially
at the time of electoral campaigns or in domestic policy to hide
some social problems. To do so is to do a great harm to the immigrants,
by exciting against them antiracial feelings and xenophobia.<BR>

<P>
d) full facilities must be given for those who want to be integrated
in the country of immigration. <BR>

<P>
4- Finally, if we want really to favour understanding between
cultures and exchanges among our peoples around the Mediterranean,
we must give each other facilities to travel and meet; we should
avoid erecting what appears to be a &quot;citadel Europe&quot;.
<BR>

<P>
It symbolically fitting for the colloquium to be held here in
Malta, in the very centre of the Mediterranean Sea. Malta has
taken from both North and South, even in its language. By the
way, why is Malta considered European? Isn't she African? In fact
she is both European and African, i.e. she is Mediterranean.<BR>

<P>
From such a Mediterranean place, I would like, in conclusion,
to call also for a real dialogue of religions, cultures and civilisations,
to know each other much more, to understand and admit our differences.
That would be fruitful for both sides, North and South. We should
not think to reproduce a unique cultural model, and we have to
keep our own identity and to be in the meantime open to other
cultures in a spirit of tolerance. That's the Mediterranean spirit.

<P>
<B>THE CULTURAL ASPECTS OF CO-OPERATION AND SECURITY IN THE MEDITERRANEAN
<BR>
</B>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Rachid DRISS</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>, President,
<I>Association des Etudes Internationales</I>, Tunis</FONT>
<HR>

<P>
The concept of security has been analysed in depth, for a long
time, by consensus reached by discussions and confrontations of
attitudes. This concept includes military, political, economic
and social aspects. The cultural dimension has not received the
necessary attention it deserves when discussing the problem of
security.<BR>

<P>
Fortunately, Professor Huntington in a famous article in &quot;Foreign
Affairs: The clash of civilisation&quot; has raised challengingly
the question of culture as a factor of conflicts, and consequently
of security.<BR>

<P>
&quot;What do we mean when we talk about civilisation? a civilisation
is a cultural entity&quot;. This is Professor Huntington's theory.
Furthermore he enumerates the elements of a culture: language,
history, religion, dress, institutions... and he adds: civilisations
are differentiated from each other by historical, language, cultural
and most importantly religions traditions.<BR>

<P>
People of different civilisations have different views on the
relation between God and man, the individual and the group, the
citizen and the state, parents and children, husband and wife,
as well as different views of the relative importance of rights
and responsibilities, liberty and authority, equality and hierarchy.
<P>
These differences are the product of centuries, they will not
disappear in the foreseeable future. They are far more fundamental
than differences between political ideologies and regimes. Differences
do not necessarily mean conflict, and conflicts do not mean violence.
Over the centuries, however, differences among civilisations have
generated the most prolonged and &quot;the most violent'' conflict.
<BR>

<P>
I am not going to comment on the thesis of Professor Huntington.
Though I do not share all the ideas he has advanced, I consider
his remarks as pertinent and a source of fruitful debate on the
cultural aspects of security, the impact of civilisation, the
behaviours of nations and individuals, the true importance of
which has been neglected up till now.<BR>

<P>
Taking this theory as a reference, I shall try to go through the
situation in the Mediterranean countries and their peoples and
give suggestions on the use of cultural factors to overcome differences
and build a Mediterranean community. Needless to say at the outset
that to reach this goal we clear a political commitment.<BR>

<P>
The Barcelona Conference of November' 95 constitutes a step in
that direction. In its final Declaration, it emphasised the importance
of the dialogue between cultures and civilisations.<BR>

<P>
A group of experts is due to meet in order to propose concrete
measures and actions in the fields of culture. On the other hand,
it draws attention to the necessity of a better comprehension
between existing religions of the Euro-Mediterranean area as well
as organises meetings between representatives of the religions:
theologians, lay university professors and other interested persons.
The aim of these meetings is to master prejudices, ignorance and
fanaticism and promote co-operation. The Declaration includes
items connected with culture, such as education, science and technology,
the increasingly important media, and raises many problems in
this time of speedy and complex evolution.
<P>
Let us now deal with a few items, considered as elements of culture,
especially about the Mediterranean area. <BR>

<P>
In the Mediterranean region there are more than 10 languages,
not including dialects: Arabic, Berber, Turkish, Hebrew, French,
Italian, Spanish, Greek, Albanian, Slavic, Maltese, Portuguese,
(Portugal is considered part of the Mediterranean area by proximity).
We can also add English, spoken in Malta and Cyprus. All these
languages convey values, concepts, behaviours. Each one of them
can even convey different messages. Let us take Arabic as an example:
it is used by Arab nationalists to glorify the Arab nation and
Arab unity. It is used by Moslems to explain Islam, profess tolerance
and virtue, find the seeds of modernisation in Islamic teaching,
or it can be used by Islamic integrists to refute the modern constitutional
governments and claim an Islamic State with the Koran as the only
source of government or legislation.<BR>

<P>
Another example is the French language which carries the ideas
of the French revolution as well as socialism or capitalism, conservatism
or liberalism and also xenophobia and racism using more or less
the same words.<BR>

<P>
All languages convey traditions inherited from the past which
are the background of peoples' cultures. <BR>

<P>
These traditions can bring people together or separate them. Pascal,
the French philosopher of the 17th century said: &quot;Truth on
this side of the Pyreneans, lies on the other side&quot; and Kipling
said &quot;East and West is West and never the twin shall meet&quot;,
having in mind different cultures and behaviours. I shall come
back to that later when dealing with the religious aspects of
culture. Languages separate by their diversity. How can they facilitate
co-operation between the peoples of the Mediterranean area? We
recognise the problem and we have to solve it in such a way that
language becomes the instrument of understanding and not an instrument
of confrontation.<BR>

<P>
At the end of the 19th century, a philologist, Dr. Zamenhof, born
in Barcelona in 1887, created a new language, with the hope of
realising this union. It was called Esperanto. It did work for
about 50 years, used mostly by intellectuals and pacifists, it
was even proposed as a UN language, but without success, and Esperanto
vanished as it was artificial, without literature or tradition.
After World War II, English is almost becoming a universal language,
but there are reactions from the French, the Spanish and others.
Whatever its audience, English cannot become the single international
language. For centuries, Latin, Greek, Arabic, French were used
by a large number of people who traded with one another. The conclusion
we can draw is that one single language cannot be adopted for
relations between the peoples.<BR>

<P>
The Internet system, considered by experts as a revolution in
the field of communications, whose importance is the equivalent
of the Gutenberg invention of printing, started by circulating
information only in English, but other nations reacted to this
and have started feeding the system with their own language, French
and Spanish texts are already available and other languages will
follow, Japanese, Arabic, German and Russian.<BR>

<P>
The solution to the problem of languages is the ability to learn
and use as many languages as possible. The knowledge of languages
is as important as learning mathematics. A language is the key
that opens doors for co-operating for peace and security. When
words have the same meaning in negotiations, there is a better
chance for understanding and no misunderstanding in translations.

<P>
The School for Oriental Languages in Paris played an important
role in the understanding of other civilisations during the colonial
period.<BR>

<P>
In Tunisia, we emphasise the teaching of languages. People of
Tunisia used to speak Arabic and French, but today we have more
young ones speaking English or German. Recently Hebrew has been
introduced in the university curriculum, but in the Institute
for Foreign Languages, there are teachers of Chinese and Japanese.
The Mediterranean countries should encourage the teaching of languages
as an instrument for better understanding, communication and security.
As I have already stated, language allows people to know about
each other's traditions, ways and means of living, cultural background
and it can either unite or separate them. As we study traditions,
we often discover that they are rooted in religions. <BR>

<P>
In the Mediterranean area, our three religions are monotheistic.
In principle, they teach the same faith in God, but they differ
in conceptions and ways to implement his laws: Jehovah for whom
the Nation of Israel is prominent, God the Father, with Jesus
as the Son and the Holy Spirit form the Trinity, the main principle
of which is the love for the neighbours and Allah for Islam, professing
universality with the concept of Umma (Islamic community). The
analysis of religions is a passionate item. One cannot ignore
that, though the three religions have the same origin: monotheism
is the basis of the three, but there are differences. These differences,
the various interpretations of the founding texts and the conduct
(belief of the believers have been at the origin of religious
conflicts and wars). <BR>

<P>
The Crusades, in the Middle Ages, the Arab-Israeli conflict, to
a certain extent, the war in ex-Yugoslavia between Christian Orthodox
and Moslems, and even the conflict in Chechenia, all have an explanation
or an excuse in religious differences. To have security and co-operation
in the Mediterranean region, we need a better understanding of
our religions and accept once of the differences, a notion of
tolerance in our relations.<BR>

<P>
The Barcelona Declaration, as I have already said, recommended
an action for understanding and tolerance among peoples from different
religious credos. These recommendations were the result of determined
and patient action undertaken especially by UNESCO. Different
meetings and seminars have been held on this subject. One was
held in Carthage, Tunisia, at the Academy of Sciences and Letters
&quot;Beit El Hikma&quot; on 21 and 22 April 1995, with the co-operation
of UNESCO. The participants issued a declaration called &quot;Charte
de Carthage sur la tol&eacute;rance en M&eacute;diterran&eacute;e&quot;.
In this Charter, it is said that the long experience of humanity
shows clearly that no peace between peoples can prevail without
peace between political or religious believers. It therefore emphasises
the duty of the three monotheistic religions of the Mediterranean
to promote in their midsts as well as elsewhere in their relations
with other societies, the values of liberty, tolerance and human
rights. The participants also invited all peoples of good will
to work for the dialogue between the two shores of the Mediterranean
sea for peace, co-operation and tolerance among their populations.
<BR>

<P>
A previous seminar organised by our Association for International
Studies on the relations between Maghreb and European Union on
November 24, 25 and 26, 95 recommended in its final Declaration
a cultural action. <BR>

<P>
Cultural action aims at a deep mutation in the mentalities. It
will strive to eliminate secular prejudices, erase stereotypes
deep in people's minds, giving distorted images, here of Western
societies, there of Islam. Schools, books, newspapers, radio and
television programs, films and theatre shows, all those media
will be in excess in countries on both sides to imprint in everyone's
minds a more serene image of his neighbours, his credos, his customs
and his yearnings. <BR>

<P>
A sense of tolerance, co-operation, human rights and peace has
always been present among the Tunisian elite. The Tunisian reformists
at the end of the 19th century, true to Islamic teaching as well
as the principles of the French Revolution, tried to modernise
the state at the same time as the Ottoman Empire and Egypt. <BR>

<P>
Tunisia abolished slavery in 1846. This decision taken by Ahmed
Bey was in conformity with the Koran which exports Moslems to
liberate slaves. In 1857, Mohammed Bey proclaimed the Security
Charter &quot;Ahd El Aman&quot;, a sort of human rights declaration.
In 1861, a Constitution was proclamaided by the Bey of Tunis Mohamed
Sadok along the same principles. Western thoughts and the ideas
of the French Revolution had their impact on the rulers, who tried
to adapt them to the traditional ways of the government. Kheireddine
Pacha, Prime Minister of Tunisia, then Chancellor of the Ottoman
Empire wrote a book called <I>The best way to know the condition
of Kingdoms.<BR>
</I>
<P>
In this book, he surveys the situation in several European countries
he had visited, their political systems and the improvements they
had achieved. Then he compared them with the situation in Islamic
countries of the Ottoman Empire, and Tunisia in particular, addressing
the politicians and the scholars of Islamic law. He draws their
attention to the difference between Europe's prosperity and contribution
to civilisation, democratic and liberal traditions, implementation
of justice, advancement of science and industrialisation. He explains
that these improvements are the result of a long march of the
European rationalism but they exist also in the fundamental values
of Islam.
<P>
In 1905, Cheikh Abdelaziz Thalbi, the founder of the Destour Party
(Destour means constitution) published a book called <I>The spirit
of liberalism in the Koran</I>. In this book, he glorifies the
European Renaissance, the French Revolution and the Declaration
on Human Rights. He also deals with the progressive status of
women in Islam, the relations between Moslems and Christians,
the universality and the tolerance of Islam at the core of a true
interpretation of the Koran. The main concern of both writers
was to harmonise the Sharia (the Islamic law) with modern times.
<BR>

<P>
We are following the same path. When President Bourguiba decided
in 1956 to give women equal rights with men, he founded this new
law on a liberal interpretation of the Sharia. <BR>

<P>
In the 19th century and the first half of the 20th, modernisation
was advancing in the Islamic word despite the resistance of conservative
doctors of Islamic law. Unfortunately, this trend has been reversed:
we see a violent reaction of the fundamentalists. It can be explained
by the colonialist behaviour, the repeated defeats of the Arabs
in the Middle East and the importance given by Governments to
religion. As a result of the conflict between liberal and conservative
opinions, the Islamic word is living in turmoil. Very few countries
can escape it. In Tunisia, we try to continue in our modernistic
path.<BR>

<P>
In the Mediterranean area, we think that a co-operation between
North and the south can preserve the chances for modernisation,
based on mutual understanding and co-operation. This is the condition
for stability, the prerequisite necessity to avoid conflicts of
civilisations. We have to promote liable structures for co-operation
and build for future generations the bridges for peaceful cohabitation
and joint action for peace, progress and prosperity, with respect
for human rights. <BR>

<P>
Languages and religions can separate or unite, bring conflictual
situations or even ferocious wars feeding misunderstanding, hate
and revenge. They can also encourage nations to live together
in peace and co-operation. The history of the Mediterranean countries
is abundant in conflicts, wars and confusions. At the same time,
it is full of interrelations, exchange of goods and cultures.
The area has been empires rise and collapse, each one of them
leaving behind values and traces of civilisation: Greeks, Phoenicians,
Romans, Arabs and Europeans are all parts of our Mediterranean
world which is characterised now by modern States, with a Judeo-Christian
heritage and a Moslem one. This difference of cultures is a fact,
it characterises our ways of life.<BR>

<P>
Another difference can be noticed; it is the result of the evolution
of history: the contrast between Reason and Mysticism. Reason
derives from Greek philosophy. Reason is one of the elements upon
which Islam bases its argumentation. Mysticism derives from religious
beliefs, spiritual convictions rooted deeply in ancestral traditions.
Science and rationality are born from Reason, devotion and irrationality
are born from mysticism. Civil societies confront religious ones
and we should work towards transforming this confrontation into
understanding. Stability and democracy are at stake. The dilemma
is that this confrontation is not only one of ideas, but a bloody
struggle. It was the case in the Middle Ages, with the Crusades,
and to-day with the integrist movements. To reach the necessary
harmony in cultural differences is not as easy as co-operation
in business affairs. In spite of wars, trade can continue and
business can break barriers. To reach peace in the minds and transform
cultural differences into a synthesis is a far more difficult
task. The establishment of a Euro-Mediterranean Community, in
which people can live in peace and prosper, needs serious and
continual action. 
<P>
The participants in the Barcelona Conference have fortunately
not forgotten the cultural aspect of co-operation and security.
May the future show that a turning point has been reached between
North 
<P>
and South of our &quot;Mare Nostrum&quot;.

<B>PEACE, STABILITY, SECURITY AND PROSPERITY IN THE MEDITERRANEAN
REGION<BR>

<P>
Peace, stability, security and prosperity are the key words stressed
in the Declaration approved at the Euro-Mediterranean Conference
in Barcelona last November. This is understandable considering
that these four virtues are markedly scarce in the Mediterranean
region. There is no denying however that the four are intimately
connected so that it cannot be realistically assumed that one
of them could be secured and enjoyed in the longer-term without
the other three. Instability in the Mediterranean arises mainly
from the historical sub regional conflicts, from the attempt of
radical states to radicalise international relations in the region,
and from the internal instability of some states. A sense of insecurity
arises because of the national military buildups by some key actors,
unresolved conflicts, the historic experience of the use of force
to resolve issues, and, above all, the imbalance between strong
and populous states on the one hand and small, unarmed countries
on the other hand. Many countries sense their own &quot;vulnerability&quot;,
in the meaning employed by Buzan<FONT SIZE=1>,</FONT> who distinguished
between threats, sometimes very hard to perceive, and vulnerabilities,
which he claims &quot;are fairly concrete&quot;. In the case of
many Mediterranean states, this vulnerability arises from the
strategic positions they occupy: Turkey at the head of the Dardanelles,
Egypt on the Suez Canal, Morocco and Spain command the narrow
passage linking the Mediterranean with the Atlantic, the Straits
of Gibraltar, Malta the main seaways in the midst of the Mediterranean,
and Cyprus a geostrategic position close to Turkey and the Middle
East. Some of them possess important mineral resources such as
oil, gas or phosphates.<BR>

<P>
Some have a &quot;historical sense&quot; of vulnerability <I>vis
a vis</I> more powerful neighbours (Greece - Turkey, Cyprus -
Turkey ) The nation state is by historic time-scale a recent artifact.
Hence, the internal weakness of such states, their unstable institutions
and economic problems increase their vulnerability to external
meddling, strengthens their disposition to arms buildups to overcome
their perceived vulnerabilities and in turn present a security
dilemma to their neighbours. Most of the countries of the region
have only recently emerged from colonial rule. The growing strength
of political movements which challenge the internal 
<P>
status quo in some key countries is also viewed as a source of
both instability and insecurity. Terrorism appears to be endemic
to the region. Drug trafficking is a growing concern in tandem
with the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Falling
prosperity is evident on both the northern as well as southern
shores of the Mediterranean. In the south it is reflected in the
falling GNP per capita ratios, as economic growth continues to
be generally positive but inadequate to keep up with demographic
changes. On the northern shore countries it is epitomised by the
growing developmental gap between the southern and northern regions
of Europe. On both shores rising unemployment, an inadequate economic
infrastructure, social and health care problems bedevil governments.
In the southern shore states, a liberal democratic state structure
based on the full and adequate participation of the people, expectancy
of peaceful change in governance through fair elections, the rule
of law and respect for human rights are still far from becoming
the norm, making such states prone to change by violent means
and raising concern in Europe about their long-term stability.
<BR>

<P>
The European Union has long realised that instability in the Mediterranean
region can possibly have destabilising effects on Europe itself.
Lacking the institutions and the legal basis for joint political
action by the Member States in the fields of security and defence,
it acted as a civilian power in the region, employing economic
statecraft to achieve political aims. The first association agreements
signed with Greece and Turkey in the early sixties were particularly
aimed at strengthening the economic stability of these key NATO
countries in the era of the policy of containment. It used the
association agreement with Greece to show its disdain of the military
junta while the latter reigned in Athens, and finally it opened
its doors wide open to Greece, Spain and Portugal in order to
stabilise the democratisation and modernisation process following
the end of the dictatorships in the three countries. Similarly,
the European Union is employing like means in its efforts to stabilise
the situation in central and eastern Europe as well as the Mediterranean
region. In the past, it skilfully employed the Global Mediterranean
Policy (GMP) to bind all the countries of the region (except Libya
and Albania which refused a formal accord with the Community)
in a relationship to it, though this did not always turn out to
be a happy one, especially from the late seventies onwards when
the Community applied protectionist measures against the MNCs
on textile and clothing goods. The GMP has had a positive effect
in helping the MNCs maintain their traditionally important exports
to Metropolitan Europe, partially transforming the relationship
from one of dependence into interdependence, but in the seventies,
when Europe found itself in economic difficulties it quickly turned
protectionist so that this policy stance combined with supply-side
problems on the part of the MNCs quickly led to disgruntlement
with the GMP. Besides, the instruments of the GMP to tackle the
present problems which the EU faces in the Mediterranean region
are inadequate, both because these challenges demand twofold political
and economic initiatives, not merely economic statecraft, and
because in the post-Maastricht setting, when the EU is supposed
to be developing a Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) it
cannot limit itself to GMP methods, while the efficiency of its
policies has to be judged against the exploited and unexploited
potential of the Maastricht Treaty. In the past, the EC had tried
to remedy its obvious lack of a foreign policy by creating the
European Political Co-operation (EPC). However, an EC foreign
policy never came into being. Europe found itself divided on many
key issues, not least among these those related to the Mediterranean
region. The EC's response to the Middle East war of 1967 and then
to the first oil crisis in 1974 brought in to focus the divisions
among European states. Subsequently, hopelessly unable to give
substance to many of its policies, Europe limited itself to a
declarative foreign policy largely based on issuing statements,
many of which were exceptional in their content and foresight,
notwithstanding that at times they met with incredulous criticism
from the United States.<FONT SIZE=1> </FONT>During the cold war,
Europe played second fiddle to the superpowers in the maintenance
of the military balance of power in the region and was virtually
absent in the most important of the Mediterranean crises, notably
the Middle East problem. Lastly, in the absence of a European
foreign policy, the member states of the EC were left free to
conduct their own foreign policies as dictated by their respective
national interests, with some feeble attempts to co-ordinate them,
lest they face the graver accusation that they were sidetracking
the more profound aim of developing EPC. The weakness of EPC was
not only exploited but used as an excuse for individual forays.
This resulted in a number of premature initiatives in the region,
all cursed with the seeds of failure from their beginnings. Reference
to these initiatives will be made further down. <BR>

<P>
The new phase in the EU's relations with the Mediterranean countries,
launched with the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership started in Barcelona
will perhaps put an end to unco-ordinated national initiatives
and weld the economic and political aspects of Europe's policy
in the region more tightly. It has the advantage of making the
Union's Mediterranean policy a policy for the whole of the Union
rather than one limited to the Mediterranean member states. However,
it is rather still early to start celebrating the success of this
policy.<BR>

<P>
For a start, history testifies to the fact that the attention
which the EU has given to the Mediterranean region in the past
has been dyslexic, even in times when the Mediterranean region
was the only one where the Community could play a role in the
external arena. The pattern of the EC's policies towards the region
has been historically marked by flurries of intense activity followed
by long pauses of inertia as the Community busied itself with
internal matters. A period of inertia followed the signing of
the first Association agreements with two Mediterranean countries
at the start of the sixties and in fact, throughout the eighties
to the beginning of the nineties, the EC neglected the Mediterranean
region as it busied itself with a number of internal and external
problems: internally the completion of the internal market, the
Single European Act, the intergovernmental conference which led
to the signing of the Maastricht Treaty, the difficult ratification
process; externally - the completion of the negotiations leading
to the second enlargement (Spain and Portugal, 1985), negotiations
with the EFTA group for the creation of the European Economic
Area (EEA), enlargement negotiations with the EFTA group, the
Uruguay Round of negotiations, and finally after 1989 the situation
in Central and Eastern Europe. It was in response to growing criticism
that the EU was neglecting the Mediterranean region and the need
to reintroduce some balance in its external relations that, in
June 1990, proposals were put forward by the Commission for redirecting
the EU's Mediterranean policy. From there onwards it took another
five years for the proposal to be developed into the idea of the
Euro-Mediterranean Partnership launched last November.<BR>

<P>
This ambivalence may be explained by the fact that with only five
Mediterranean member states (if Portugal is considered as such)
the European Union is essentially a northern-central European
entity. Of the five Mediterranean states, Spain and Portugal have
only recently joined the Community and have been practically engrossed
with adjusting to their new situation. France, described by Braudel<FONT SIZE=1>
</FONT>as having throughout its history mostly identified with
central Europe, remains true to form in the contemporary age.
Italy, always beset by domestic political problems, generally
shuns external action. This has been more pronounced since the
&quot;end of the first Republic&quot;. Greece is interested only
in the Aegean and Turkey as we have been shown time and again,
and has used its EC membership to condition Turkey and more recently
to undermine Macedonia, with little time to spare for more comprehensive
ideas on the Mediterranean region as a whole. The enlargement
of the EU to include Malta and Cyprus will provide the Union with
mixed blessings: Cyprus will reinforce Greece's policy - thus
giving a negative contribution to the development of the CFSP;
Malta will presumably follow a policy more consistent with the
overall interests of the EU in the Mediterranean - thus giving
a positive contribution to the development of the Mediterranean
policy.<BR>

<P>
The Mediterranean member states of the EU now have the opportunity
to change old habits. Euro-Mediterranean leaders meeting in Barcelona
agreed to establish a comprehensive partnership among all the
states of the littoral, based on an ongoing dialogue. Three main
pillars were singled out for the realisation of these plans: the
establishment of a common area of peace and security; creating
an area of shared prosperity; and developing human resources,
promoting understanding between cultures and exchanges between
civil societies. The Barcelona Declaration is thus a manifesto
of good intentions for the Mediterranean region. The frequent
use of the word 'dialogue' elicits sentiments of <I>deja vu</I>
and reminds one that this is after all a continuation of the Euro-Arab
Dialogue began with much fanfare in 1975 over the heads of the
Americans worried that it would inject too much noise into Kissinger's
Middle East diplomacy model, or that it would decouple Europe
from the United states and split the Western camp. That 'dialogue'
of the deaf, as it turned out, led to few tangible results as
the Europeans struggled to secure guarantees of uninterrupted
oil supplies at reasonable prices while the Arab side tried in
vain to promote the Palestinian question. When world markets pushed
oil prices down, the 'dialogue' lost much of its luster for the
European side, while the divisions in the Arab world following
the Camp David accords weakened the interest of the other counterpart
as well. The process became another sad chapter in the history
of Euro-Mediterranean relations. It underlined the fact that the
two sides had ignored real designs and had opted instead for vague
idealistic ones. Had they adhered to the Cairo Joint Memorandum
both sides would have achieved more lasting results.<BR>

<P>
Before Barcelona, when it had already finalised its not so &quot;grand
design&quot; for the Mediterranean region, the European Union
decided to underwrite the effort with a not very generous, but
certainly not negligible sum of ECU 4.7 billion to be disbursed
over a period of five years (1995-99) in aid to the Non-Member
Mediterranean countries (MNCs).<FONT SIZE=1> </FONT>Originally
the Commission had proposed a total aid programme of ECUs 5.5.
billion in addition to European Investment Bank (EIB) resources.
This financial aid package is simply a continuation of the tradition
of financial aid started with the beginning of the so called 'Global
Mediterranean Policy' (GMP) in the mid-seventies. It is true that
the EU has a right to a &quot;Community Preference&quot; in favour
of its own backward regions in disbursing development aid. However,
the differences in the rate of such aid are staggering (for example,
aid to the MNCs is lower on a per capita basis than that given
to Central and Eastern Europe, while when compared with that given
to Ireland, Portugal and Greece under the structural funds, such
aid to the MNCs compared on a per capita basis is 57 times lower).
When consideration is taken of the fact that the EU's own backward
regions are by comparison more developed than the MNCs the inadequacy
of financial aid to the Mediterranean countries becomes even more
staggering. Not oblivious to the accusations that this sum was
inadequate and that it did not add to as much as the EU was spending
on central and eastern Europe, and noting that Europe's declared
aim to maintain a balance in its relations with all its neighbours,
the EU finally threw in the sop that this fund will be augmented
by unspecified financial assistance from the European Investment
Bank (EIB) and from bilateral aid agreements.
<P>
The question of financial aid to the MNCs is linked to the issue
of whether a sound case for it can be put forward. The matter
is somewhat complex. During the decade from the mid-seventies
to the mid-eighties, while increased wealth flowed to the oil
producers and non-oil countries benefited from increased trade
in goods and services (e.g earnings from workers' remittances)
with them or loans on very favourable terms, the negative effects
of bad economic policies of extensive state intervention, subsidies,
import substitution policies, capital controls, extensive bureaucracy
etc could be hidden under the flow of petrodollars. Significantly
among the MNCs five countries, all with a negligible or no dependence
on the oil economy and which followed an open economic policy
or launched one during the period, at present have some of the
more resilient economies in the region. Soon after the world price
of oil started declining and revenues dried up significantly,
the fissures began to appear and many MNCs were left perched on
a high foreign debt mountain. In the midst of this crisis the
MNCs, prodded by the IMF and World Bank, were converted to the
virtues of economic reform. Did they in fact have a choice? The
restructuring thus started under significantly adverse economic
conditions, compounded in some instances by a severe debt problem
and rapid population growth.<BR>

<P>
It is within this context that the poor financial package offered
by the EU should be discussed. One thing is certain, namely that
the Union cannot take on the challenges of transformation occurring
in central and eastern Europe and the Mediterranean simultaneously
without overhauling its finances and without ditching the wasteful
Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). The relevant question is whether
Europe should increase its aid package to a region (the Mediterranean)
which had enjoyed a decade of surplus wealth but was unable to
transform it into more lasting economic development. The answer
seems to be linked to the fact that the contextual frameworks
are different. The former situation, when the MNCs failed to take
advantage of the wind which blew in their sails was a missed opportunity.
The present situation is however one in which the MNCs are reforming
their economies and significant financial flows to such economies
in transition could help them overcome the unpopular adjustment
costs and enhance their internal social and political stability.
Previously, enough petrodollars existed in the region to help
MNC governments maintain stability. Now they can no longer do
so and uncontrolled instability can slip over into the Community
itself. The EC is not oblivious to the need of supporting reform.
In the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership Agreements initialled between
the EC and Tunisia, Morocco and Israel<FONT SIZE=1> </FONT>the
priorities established for financial aid are to help the MNCs
cope with reforms. The main questions remain whether the aid is
sufficient and whether enough attention has been given to the
time factor and cultural constraints. There is always a time lag
between the proposed economic restructuring and the benefits that
accrue from such initiatives. The second (i.e cultural constraints)
is related to the fact that it may be axiomatically difficult
to transfer the values of liberalisation, essentially of advanced
societies, to countries which culturally may still be unprepared
for modernisation at such speed. Clearly the economic decision-making
cannot be divorced from the political. <BR>

<P>
While falling short of fully underwriting the reforms in the Mediterranean
non-member countries with more generous financial aid, Europe
has not shown itself sympathetic to the political leeway which
the MNCs should be allowed to manage change either. Europe insisted
that as part of the Euro-Med Partnership, the MNCs must gradually
develop democracy and respect for human rights. Insistence on
these Western values is positive, but not unproblematic. Europe
must stand up for the respect of human rights. However, transformation
of the present regimes into democratic ones may, if it is allowed
to happen before the economic reforms have been given the chance
to bear their fruits, lead to the transfer of power from governments
which are not democratic (according to Western yardsticks) to
governments which actually do not believe in the Western notion
of democracy (the case of Algeria is instructive). The adverse
implications for Europe of such a development need not be spelled
out. Perhaps the aberration in this case is the non-truth that
the development of market economies and democratic principles
need move hand in hand. On the other hand the maintenance of authoritarian
rule in some MNCs may be needed to see the reforms through, once
other means such as increased financial aid are unavailable to
underwrite the process. Once market economies have bloomed, democracy
may come charging in its trail. Is this not the path which some
newly industrialising countries in Asia have followed ? Is this
not the trend that may, in the opinion of some crystal ball gazers,
see the last of the communists in China eventually swept away
? Democracy may not be a feasible project in all countries in
the Mediterranean in the medium term. Respect for human rights
short of full democratic rights may be a more workable solution.
<P>
Turning once more to the economic impact of the Free Trade Area,
so far reference has been made to the long-term benefits and short-run
costs. It is worth outlining what these costs and benefits are.
Some restructuring has already occurred in the MNCs to varying
degrees. The liberalisation process, which will be accelerated
by the free trade area should lead to the reallocation of economic
resources and help the MNCs shift these towards those economic
activities in which they have a comparative advantage. Much will
depend in this case on how fast this reallocation will take place.
The greater openness of the economy will encourage more competition
and cut down excessive monopolistic profits. It will increase
efficiency (more mergers and shutdowns of inefficient firms) but
unemployment will increase. 
<P>
Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) may be stimulated. But political
instability, and bureaucratic bottlenecks might bring around a
lower level of FDI than expected. Openness may also lead to disinvestment
in the sense of firms presently situated in the MNCs relocating
to Europe, once they will still be free to export to the MNCs.
The latter phenomenon may not be so large as to cause worries,
but watch out for perceptions on political stability in the MNCs.
<BR>

<P>
Lastly it is worth noting that many MNCs have already achieved
the most they could have achieved given their present economies
in their exports to the EC, and the new Euro-Mediterranean Partnership
agreements do not offer substantial improvements in this regard.
On the other hand, the EU stands to gain more from trade liberalisation
both in the short-run as well as in the long-run. <BR>

<P>
Many MNCs are already shifting their tax system from reliance
on import tariffs to consumption taxes (such as the introduction
of VAT) . An overhaul of the fiscal system is required in the
MNCs to set up a new fiscal balance between revenue and expenditure.
Liberalisation may also cause persistent balance of payments difficulties
as people spend more on consumption. In case of acute balance
of payments difficulties the EU has promised that it will help
the MNCs to overcome such difficulties in consultation with the
International Monetary Fund (IMF). All in all, the MNCs will have
to take a gradualist approach to liberalisation while at the same
time accelerating measures to improve their economic infrastructure,
develop human resources and industrial restructuring.
<P>
The state of economic health of the Mediterranean countries is
such that caution must be advised in approaching reforms. Consider
that according to World Bank's classification, in 1994-95, Jordan,
Morocco and Syria were designated as severely indebted countries,
while Albania, Egypt, Algeria, Greece, Tunisia, Turkey and the
ex-Yugoslav republics were moderately indebted countries.<FONT SIZE=1>
</FONT>Unemployment is another concern, reflecting the fact that
economic expansion has been unable to keep up with the expansion
in the labour force caused by demographic changes<FONT SIZE=1>.</FONT>
Rates of economic growth have to be increased massively if these
countries are to provide enough job opportunities to keep up with
demographic changes. During periods of economic restructuring,
economies might do exactly the opposite of what is needed of them,
and shed jobs rather then create new ones.<BR>

<P>
In the abstract, the creation of a Euro-Mediterranean Free Trade
Area (FTA) will in the longer-run reap benefits for all the people
in the region thus helping to strengthen economic development,
social cohesion and internal stability in most countries. It will
also reap benefits for the EU which itself will be able to increase
its exports to the region. However, the limited content which
the Euro-Mediterranean free trade area has been given may yet
rob it of its major economic impact. For instance, it is detrimental
that agricultural trade has been left out and the free movement
of labour, at least after a transitional phase, is similarly excluded.
In the past, as transpired during the setting up of the Global
Mediterranean Policy and during the negotiations with the MNCs
preceding the second enlargement, further concessions to the MNCs
on agricultural exports were welcomed by northern EU member states
and resisted primarily by the EU Mediterranean member states.
The evidence is clear that although some concessions on agricultural
trade were made by the Community, as is amply shown in the first
three Euro-Mediterranean Partnership agreements concluded so far,
the issue of further trade liberalisation in this sector was postponed
until after the year 2000. For the MNCs, the weaker side in the
bargaining which has taken place, half a loaf may be better than
no bread at all. However, objectively considered, the EC has again
shown its meanness in a sector where it could greatly help the
MNCs without having to dip deeper in its coffers, something which
it (the EC) is extremely reluctant to do. By its actions the EC
is further retarding economic progress in the MNCs. <BR>

<P>
One more important query that needs be answered concerns the seriousness
with which the EU is pursuing the Euro-Mediterranean free trade
area. How much hope should we allow to glow in our hearts that
the EU is keen on realising the Euro-Mediterranean free trade
area ? This time the Community appears dead serious. Historically,
the creation of a free trade area was the aim of the Global Mediterranean
Policy, but alas three full decades into that policy it has never
come to pass, of course through no fault of the Community. The
main difficulty, though even in this case it is not completely
unproblematic, is not the liberalisation of north-south trade,
but the liberalisation of south-south trade and the free movement
of factors. Not even the concession of cumulative rules of origin
granted to the Maghreb countries in the bilateral trading agreements
signed with the EC since 1978 was enough to make these states
forge closer economic links between them. The Arab Maghreb Union,
which blows hot or cold depending on the situation in the region,
has fallen short of expectations, despite its rational underpinnings.
In the absence of resolve among the MNCs or of the conditions
which will lead to the realisation of the free trade on a south-south
basis, the European Union could possibly fill the gap by maintaining
a leadership role and ensuring the continuation of the momentum.
Yet on past experience, the EU is prone to retreat from Mediterranean
initiatives into long periods of neglect when it busies itself
with internal affairs. For the future, the EU's &quot;internal&quot;
agenda (the IGC, EMU etc) appears full. Externally its priority
is enlargement to include the countries of central and eastern
Europe, and not its relations with the Mediterranean countries.
<P>
One important consideration is that although, apart from what
has already been discussed so far, none of the EU world trading
rivals are prepared to mount the kind of policy for the Mediterranean
region which the EC has set up, the region is not impervious to
non-EU challenges such as those coming from lower cost producers
in Asia. The EU has every interest to consolidate its position
in the Mediterranean region. Then the EU's motivations for the
creation of the Euro-Mediterranean Free Trade area are not simply
altruistic. The FTA was not sought after by the MNCs which were
happy with unilateral concessions and would have preferred to
widen their benefits while carrying on with economic restructuring
and gradual trade liberalisation. World Trade Organisation (WTO)
rules established by the Uruguay Round entail that preferential
trading arrangements (PTAs) which the EU has with the MNCs are
legal only if they are eventually transformed into a free trade
area within a reasonable time of around a decade, though this
is not specified. PTAs have always militated against GATT's corner
stone, the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) clause, but were tolerated
on the grounds that the asymmetry which they introduced between
trading partners, whereby the developed countries granted preferences
to developing countries without requiring them to match these
concessions by equal and reverse preferences, favoured the developing
countries. Yesterday's dogma is today's untruth and there are
abundant economic arguments to show that this should no longer
be blindly accepted. Following the Uruguay Round, interim agreements
leading to the formation of a free trade area or a customs union
are no longer free from a time constraint, and they have now to
be achieved over an agreed time frame accepted by the WTO<FONT SIZE=1>.</FONT>
Hence the urgency of the EU to establish a time frame of 12 years
to achieve its free trade area agreements with the MNCs. <BR>

<P>
When due consideration is given to the WTO pressures and the fact
that the EC for its own interests is intent on achieving the free
trade area, it will appear that significant progress will be made
on north-south trade liberalisation, while south-south liberalisation
(which may be of greater economic importance to the MNCs) may
take much longer. In sum, the difficulties in concluding the FTA
are many: primarily there are three time factor problems, ie the
length of time it is going to take to negotiate the myriad accords
to establish the free trade area, the constraint that the EC-MNC
FTA will have to be established over a period of twelve years,
and last but not least that this twelve year period, which may
be short for the purposes of economic transformation with palatable
side-effects, may be too long for the political changes in the
region. They might turn in such a way as to eventually overturn
the whole process. Ironically, the longer the time frame, the
bigger the danger that the process will stall due to a worsening
of the political situation in the region. <BR>

<P>
There are however other difficulties: tariff dismantling and the
three freedoms<FONT SIZE=1> </FONT>will not bring about the FTA
unless trans-Mediterranean communications and transport networks
are also established. The Barcelona Declaration makes ample reference
to this. Achieving the networks will require a sustained investment
effort. A large amount of learning how to conduct south-south
trade is required, for the dominant trend is still the one established
during the colonial era on a north-south axis. This will require
a substantial amount of transfer of know-how from Europe to the
south. <BR>

<P>
In practical terms the eventual achievement of the Euro-Mediterranean
free trade area will depend in the first instance on the successful
upgrading of the EU's present trading agreements with the MNCs,
a process which has already started. Cyprus and Turkey have a
customs union in place and in any case Cyprus and Malta will join
the Union in about two years. New FTA agreements have been initialled
with Tunisia, Israel and Morocco, while negotiations carry on
with the rest. With regard to trade liberalisation and the four
freedoms, as far as a south-south basis is concerned, what may
be easier is a round of multilateral trade negotiations between
all the states of the region very much on traditional GATT pattern
(or the EU-EFTA negotiations for the EEA) with a priviously agreed
time-frame for the conclusion of the agreement, and which will
set out a working plan for the next twelve years .<BR>

<P>
Turning to the political aspect of the Euro-Mediterranean relationship,
the first priority for Europe is to resolve clearly in its mind
the tension between democracy and economic progress, both of which
have been singled out as contributing to security and stability
in the region. The argument is that the successful launching of
the FTA is essential for increasing the momentum of economic growth
in the region and for achieving greater prosperity. Prosperity
lessens social tensions and provides the conditions for internal
stability, and in turn makes possible the full democratisation
of societies. Democratisation of states lessens the chances of
war or external conflict, though it does not remove the threat
completely. It must not be assumed that fully fledged democracies
do not go to war<FONT SIZE=1> </FONT>or that the present conflict
situations in the Mediterranean are all the result of the absence
of democracy. Such mental leaps can lead to catastrophic policies.
An analogous leap is to say that the end of superpower confrontation
in the Mediterranean region has produced the conditions for ending
the conflicts. Indeed, the end of the cold war may have had beneficial
effects on the Middle East but may for example have removed one
of the strongest restraining influences on such historical rivals
as Greece and Turkey. The fall of communism may have deprived
the radical states in the region of the moral and material support
of the USSR, but new challenges have arisen from international
terrorism, supported very often from a number of far-flung countries
outside the region. The dissolution of the Soviet Union, may have
facilitated the proliferation of weapons, know-how and material
for the construction of weapons of mass destruction. Indeed, there
is no end of history in sight in the Mediterranean region.<BR>

<P>
Resort to collective security arrangements are a tempting proposition
but inherently flawed. Equally dangerous may be European institutional
prototypes grafted onto the region such as the proposed Conference
on Security and Co-operation in the Mediterranean (CSCM), the
Mediterranean Forum or the Council of the Mediterranean which
create opportunities for parliamentarians but are so broadly aimed
that they lose momentum. To borrow Bismarck's dictum from a completely
different historical context, &quot;the great questions of the
day will not be decided by speeches and the resolutions of majorities&quot;
but by actions which are more lasting. The institutions mentioned
above may become useful only when the urgent problems of economic
reform have been solved and democratic government has become the
norm. Unluckily for us, such institutions in the present conjecture
may be instrumental in creating a fictitious sense of security,
falling short of providing real security, and prolonging or stopping
the search for a real cure. 
<P>
What may be a more workable solution will be one in which Europe
will work actively with the main countries of the region in terms
of territorial size, population and military strength, in respect
of two or three of the most threatening issues in the region such
as international terrorism, proliferation of the weapons of mass
destruction and disarmament. The aim would be that lasting, verifiable
and enforceable agreements are achieved. Once a critical mass
is thus achieved in the region, other areas could then be tackled.
<BR>

<P>
<B>Conclusion<BR>
</B>
<P>
The problems of the Mediterranean region are many but not incurable.
This paper has concentrated on the main difficulties in achieving
the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership as I see them. The Partnership
will succeed if the variables discussed in this paper, or the
majority of them, are constantly kept in the forefront. One thing
is certain, there is a role for every country in the region to
play. The EU, as the richest and most powerful entity in the region,
must keep the momentum going constantly. The Barcelona Conference
does not make the Euro-Med Partnership. The EU must take the lead
in this, as it must assume the responsibility of giving the MNCs
more market access, especially by opening its markets more to
Mediterranean agricultural products. Economic reform in the MNCs
must take priority but this will be successful only if it moves
forward with a velocity which would allow the national authorities
to deal adequately with its negative side effects. The liberal
notion that the market will deal with all problems is flawed and
can produce disasters whereby unpopular economic changes give
rise to alternative totalitarianism in the MNCs. The EU can do
a lot to help this process forward primarily by reforming its
own financial resources with a view to providing more finance
to underwrite the reform processes. The time factor is enigmatic:
the longer the problems are left untackled, the worse they grow.
Too fast a reforming move forward may create negative repercussions
which may arrest the process. The more time passes, the greater
the possibility that the political setting will become hostile
to further reforms before the project has been successfully concluded.
Political and economic questions are deeply intertwined and the
EU cannot hope to execute its role satisfactorily by limiting
itself to the traditional tools of the GMP, namely economic statecraft,
or to those of EPC, namely a declarative foreign policy. The principal
role of the MNCs will consist in maintaining the reforms at home,
opening up with vigour to south-south economic integration, and
moving their societies further along the path of democracy and
human rights without endangering the whole process. Lastly, the
Euro-Mediterranean Partnership cannot be considered as a costless
project. In the short run, the MNCs must bear the burdens of transformation
while the EU must bear the costs of financing it. The EU is meanwhile
negotiating Euro-Partnership agreements with the MNCs. It has
concluded one such agreement with Tunisia and one with Morocco.

<P>
It is busily concluding one with Egypt and has upgraded its agreement
with Israel. All of these bear the stamp of the unequalness of
the two negotiating sides. The superior economic power of the
Union brought to bear against the singular weakness of the individual
MNCs could not have produced a more balanced outcome. Here lies
Europe's main weakness: it proclaims a Euro-Mediterranean Partnership
but at the same time it has not only taken the lead, (as it is
expected to do) to set the ball rolling, but is imposing its strength,
thus denuding the partnership concept of its proper meaning. Europe
understands, perhaps as no other power, that the economic weaknesses
of the MNCs and their divisiveness, (they all want to negotiate
singularly in a vain attempt to maximise their unilateral national
advantage) makes them &quot;deal takers&quot; and certainly not
&quot;deal makers&quot;. <BR>

<P>
Lastly, it is important for Europe to depart from the neo-liberal
notion of excessive reliance on market forces to put everything
right that is wrong. It will not work. Perhaps when considering
liberal philosophies, the answer to today's dilemmas may lie more
in the ideas of its founding fathers of the past two centuries
then in its modern exponents. Certainly this is not a call to
a post-modernist assessment but having opened this Pandora's Box,
it is not my intention to try to close it here.

<B>THE FOLLOW-UP OF THE SECURITY ASPECTS OF THE BARCELONA DECLARATION
WITH REGARD TO OTHER INITIATIVES IN THE AREA<BR>
<BR>
</B>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Guilio PICHECA</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>, Mediterranean
Multilateral Department, Directorate-General for Political Affairs,
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Italy</FONT>
<HR>

<P>
The recent changes in the international scene, among which the
disappearance of the east-west confrontation and the progress
achieved by the Middle-Eastern peace process, have contributed
to reduce the dramatic impact of events in the region, favouring
the proliferation of co-operation initiatives, unthinkable in
the past, between the main political actors.<BR>

<P>
On the other hand, we have witnessed a series of destabilising
phenomena, giving a new dimension to security in the area, thus
justifying the action of the main international organisations,
which have each developed a Mediterranean volet. The main result
on the operational level has been the increasing recourse to multilateral
instruments as means of solving the problems of the area, including
those concerning the Middle-Eastern peace process.<BR>

<P>
The new multilateralism, after the freezing of previous experiences,
among which we can mention the CSCM Project and the 5+5 dialogue,
limited however to the western part of the basin, has been heralded
by an initiative aimed at contributing only indirectly to the
peace and stability in the area, that is the Mediterranean Forum
agreed in Alexandria in July 1994, to which Malta joined as eleventh
member a few months later. While not having achieved specific
results so far in the security field, this informal gathering
deserves nevertheless an autonomous profile as the only instance
so far existing between riparians. Other fora, such as NATO, WEU,
and OSCE (only to mention the main ones), have set up forms of
dialogue with Mediterranean partners of the southern rim, focusing
on security and military matters. In some cases the exchange of
information is pursued only on the political level, as in NATO,
in others it is institutionalised, with the participation of experts.
While aiming at defining possible common perceptions on the challenges
to stability and security in the area, the practice has shown
a different approach to security problems between the Maghreb
countries on one side, who tend to underline the economical and
social aspects (as well as terrorism, drug trafficking and pollution)
and Egypt on the other, which seems more inclined to consider
the military ones, even suggesting forms of consultation and co-operation
in this specific field. In this context interest has been shown,
for example for the activities of the new EUROFOR and EUROMARFOR
units and their operational tasks. Italy has suggested early warning
and common training of personnel involved in peace operations
as possible areas of interest in WEU. Out of the area humanitarian
and peace-keeping tasks of the Petersberg type have also been
also suggested in the new framework while the active participation
of Egyptian, Moroccan and Jordanian contingents in ex-Yugoslavia
has created a new climate in the NATO dialogue with these countries.
<BR>

<P>
A new element has been introduced in both organisations, with
the participation of Israel, whose specific perceptions contribute
to a trilateral polarisation of discussions. In this framework
the multilateralisation of meetings, to include at the same time
two or more dialogue partners has been envisaged, for example
in WEU, though this is still considered premature. An interesting
alternative has been suggested by the WEU Institute of Security
Studies, with collective briefings on some issues prior to meetings
to be held as before with each of the Mediterranean dialogue partners.
<P>
The approach favoured by Italy in these forms of dialogue, which
call indeed for a rationalisation through liaison groups in order
to avoid duplication, is flexibility as far as contents are concerned,
in order to include all issues of common interest, or regarding
the sphere of participants, with the possibility for new Mediterranean
partners to join (Algeria for example is not part of the NATO
dialogue). At the same time we stress the evolutionary nature
of the exercise, especially in the case of NATO, allowing for
a further step towards a more comprehensive dialogue.<BR>

<P>
In this context I wish to recall the idea expressed by the Italian
Minister of Defence Corcione in Williamsburg, suggesting the model
of partnership for peace - politically but not legally binding
- for some Mediterranean countries. An important aspect to consider
is the transatlantic dimension of a similar initiative, specially
considering new trends, promoted specially by France, towards
European caucus within the Alliance. On the other hand the picture
needs to be adjusted according to developments concerning the
nature and evolution of the organic link between NATO and WEU,
to be further clarified by the next Intergovernmental Conference
opening in Turin at the end of this month.<BR>

<P>
While a Mediterranean dimension has existed in CSCE since its
foundation, the dialogue with non-participant Mediterranean countries
(the name has been recently changed into Mediterranean partners)
has been further articulated, on the initiative of Italy, during
the Budapest Summit. On that occasion special priority was given
to security matters, by using some elements of the by then OSCE
model also for the Mediterranean considered as a whole. <BR>

<P>
Apart from recent changes, like holding a ministerial level conference
twice yearly and the creation of a contact group in Vienna, an
interesting Seminar on confidence and security building measures
was held last year in Cairo. Among its results the idea of a common
research center on Mediterranean agreed by Israel and Egypt. According
to new trends the relevant security matters are being increasingly
dealt with by OSCE instances competent for the Mediterranean in
all their aspects, including the socio-economic (migrations, etc.)
and, as proposed by Russia, on issues like terrorism, where the
competence of the organisation is questionable according to some
member states.<BR>

<P>
For a comprehensive picture of the main initiatives, may I recall
the work of the second interparliamentary Conference on security
and co-operation in the Mediterranean held in Valletta at the
end of last year, where the idea of creating an Association of
Mediterranean states, on the model of the Council of Europe, was
presented, requesting the Conference of Barcelona to support it,
as was reflected in the final declaration. In the same context
we may mention the project of a global initiative, including security,
presented on behalf of King Hassan of Morocco at the 1993 CSCE
ministerial Conference in Rome. The recognition by the European
Council in Essen of the strategic importance of security in the
Mediterranean, as a matter of concern for Europe and the world,
has led to the development of the call expressed in Corfu for
a global response, taking into account the composite nature of
the phenomenon. Besides the risks of arms proliferation, still
present in the region, the concept of an indivisible security
refers also to political, economical, social and cultural aspects,
such as terrorism, organised crime, drug trafficking and illegal
immigration.<BR>

<P>
While previous fora adopted either a political or a security approach
in tackling the problem of destabilising factors in the region,
the Euro-Mediterranean initiative approved in Barcelona is supposed
to act for the first time through a combination of both, according
to a model to be defined as political security, reflected in the
title of the first volet of the final declaration. The security
aspects of Barcelona, which appear quite modest as they concern
only a few paragraphs of the Declaration, have to be considered
in this light, bearing in mind the innovative character of this
volet in respect to the others.
<P>
In an effort to go further than the models of the past, the process
initiated envisages a shared and common strategy with third Mediterranean
countries already linked by economical bilateral agreements with
the European Union, to be realised on the basis of the unanimous
consensus expressed in Barcelona on some thorny issues concerning
the Middle-Eastern peace process. In this respect while the initiative
was deliberately presented as a separate exercise (differently
from the initiatives of Casablanca and Amman), the participation
in Barcelona for the first time at the same table of some of the
main actors of the peace process can be considered indeed as one
of the main achievements of the Conference.<BR>

<P>
Focusing on the main aspects of the package, we have first a series
of general principles concerning internal and external rules,
in relation to which appropriate action is expected in some fields
(for example information on human rights), issues such as the
fight against terrorism, organised crime and drug trafficking
(pertinent as well to the third volet), requirements concerning
limitation of military capability and the specific item of non-proliferation,
settled after a thorough negotiation. 
<P>
The final paragraph of the volet invites us to consider &quot;any
confidence and security-building measures that could be taken
between the parties with a view to the creation of an area of
peace and stability in the Mediterranean, including the long term
possibility of establishing a Euro-Mediterranean pact to that
end.&quot; The concept of a pact, based on the proposal initially
presented by France of a &quot;stability pact&quot; for the Mediterranean
inspired by the model already existing for some central and eastern
European countries, has been included, with the support of the
British delegation, in the final document approved at the Cannes
European Council. The former option suggested by Spain was the
definition of a possible &quot;code of conduct&quot;. The French
idea, after an attempt during the negotiating phase in Brussels,
supported by other partners from both sides of the Mediterranean
to revert to a less compulsory formula (the term &quot;charter&quot;
used in the Marin document was suggested), was finally accepted,
omitting the word &quot;stability&quot;.<BR>

<P>
This was possible since all parties agreed on the necessity to
conclude the political and security volet with a concrete line
of action, stressing nevertheless the necessity of a gradual and
flexible approach in the realisation of the project, considered
as a point of arrival rather than of departure. Successive discussions
on the matter, showed that the future instrument was one of preventive
diplomacy (confidence and transparency building measures), in
the context of an increasing consultation mechanism among members
of the partenariat, rather than of crisis management. The option
of providing additional financial support was also mentioned.
<BR>

<P>
In view of the next meeting of Senior Officials responsible for
the political and security volet of the Declaration scheduled
for next week, it is important to underline how it is the first
occasion, after Barcelona, where the 27 parties will meet, as
indicated in the Working Programme approved in Barcelona. No particular
issue is inscribed in the agenda, taking in account the fact that
it is the first meeting of a series intended to prepare proposals
for the next meeting of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs scheduled
for April 1997 in one of the 12 third Mediterranean countries
(so far Morocco, Tunisia and Malta are candidates).<BR>

<P>
After an introduction of the Presidency, aimed at giving the general
orientations of the debate, the floor will be given to the 12
TMC, who apart from the points of view which they were able to
share during the visits of the Troika in the Maghreb countries
and in Egypt, have not yet had the opportunity to present concrete
proposals for the follow-up of this delicate and innovative aspect
of the partenariat. According to reports, the concertation meeting
that took place recently in Cairo among the TMC (plus Mauritania,
whose Minister of Foreign Affairs was invited in Barcelona), under
the chairmanship of the Arab League, gives no clear hint of what
the priority issues to be raised will be.
<P>
However, according to reports, security aspects will be included
in the suggestions to be presented (it is not clear at the moment
if Algeria will still act as porteparole for the Arabs as was
the case in Barcelona). One of the issues is probably non-proliferation
of weapons of mass destruction, as a clear sign of concern was
expressed in Cairo for the fact that control provisions in this
field apply only to Arab countries, whereas the capacity of production
lies mainly with another country. Taking into account the existing
disparity also in conventional arms the participants have underlined
the necessity to reinforce the principle of balanced and reciprocal
security in the region. A programme of action was set-up for a
coordinated follow-up of the process, to be enhanced also through
the organisation in may or June next of a Seminar among the concerned
parties.<BR>

<P>
It will be difficult in this framework to predict in which direction
the Senior Officials will proceed, particularly if thorny issues
raised in Barcelona, concerning mainly the peace process, are
raised again, even if assurances obtained in the course of consultations
seem to indicate that a constructive and positive approach will
prevail. <BR>

<P>
On the side of the European Union, bearing in mind the philosophy
of the process, the opportunity must be taken to identify at this
first stage which are the concrete initiatives on which a consensus
can be built (as a point of departure we have indeed the consensus
already achieved in Barcelona), in order to tackle at a further
stage the steps requiring a greater degree of confidence. From
the formal point of view this supposes that after a first exercise
intended to break the ice, as it were, the dialogue can evolve
gradually towards a more political consultation among equals.
<BR>

<P>
The security field where such a program can conveniently flourish
appears to be the one defined as measures and instruments of preventive
diplomacy, stressing both the political and the security aspect
of the suggestions that may stem from the mutual effort. On the
basis of a common definition of the concept of confidence and
security building measures, apart from transparency measures,
conciliation procedures can be also envisaged, for example in
the peaceful settlement of disputes, through the nomination of
conciliators. An appropriate field of application could also be
good neighbourly relations, to be promoted through the said mechanisms.
The question of weapons proliferation and compliance with existing
agreements can possibly benefit from the climate and could suggest
the setting up of specific working groups on the matter. <BR>

<P>
As far as the general approach is concerned there will be no pre-established
formulas or models offered from either side. This applies also
for the long term objective of a possible pact in the area, to
be considered as a useful step inscribed in the text of the declaration,
to be achieved bearing in mind the criteria of gradualism and
flexibility. On the matter a consultation with the TMC aimed at
obtaining reactions is currently being undertaken by France, as
the main supporter of the idea. In this context I also would like
to mention the Maltese proposal of a pact of stability in the
area, previously presented, as a useful element to be considered
in the framework of the Barcelona process. <BR>

<P>
As for the composition, the European Union will be represented
at the Senior Officials' meeting by all its 15 members, with a
formula differing from the one adopted, in application of the
Barcelona Declaration, in the case of the &quot;Euro-Mediterranean
comity for the follow-up of the Barcelona process&quot;, convening
in Brussels on the 15-16 April, in the format Troika plus 12.
<BR>

<P>
The question that arises about the prospects of security in the
Mediterranean after Barcelona as one of the themes of the colloquium
(the other one being co-operation) is the following: considering
the common objective of peace and stability in the area through
what instruments may it be reached, bearing in mind the existing
destabilising factors?
<P>
An answer is indeed not easy, and we do not purport to have any
magical formula, but perhaps a few considerations can be useful
to at least restrict the field of our examination. <BR>

<P>
The need for peace and stability being taken for granted, for
the destabilising factors, I would like to refer to a very useful
analysis conducted on that subject by the Institute for Foreign
Affairs (IAI) of Dr. Aliboni, whom we have the luck to count as
one of the participants of this colloquium. He defines in a recent
article on &quot;Mediterranean security after Barcelona&quot;
the (I quote) &quot;three main factors (of Mediterranean instability,
n.d.r) having a security impact on Europe: the quick demographic
reversal that is taking place around the basin between north and
south; the slow economic growth and the large unemployment which
prevail in southern Mediterranean countries; the political vacuum
coming from the inability of poorly legitimised Arab regimes to
broaden political participation and consensus and stop religious
extremism by integrating political Islam&quot;. The question formulated
in this respect in the same article is (I quote) &quot;whether
the Barcelona agenda fits in the European security expectations,
in particular whether it will be able to bring about political
stability on the southern shore of the Mediterranean&quot;. These
are the terms of the problem clearly and concisely enunciated
by the author. The solution does not consist he adds in &quot;exporting
democracy&quot; (&quot;democracy is not indeed an obvious notion&quot;
!) but in strengthening civil societies and replacing cultural
confrontation with dialogue. Among other factors contributing
to destabilisation, we must recall the non-proliferation issue
and other items increasingly on the agenda, such as environmental
matters.<BR>

<P>
In the assessment of the threat to the security of the region,
country cases cannot be ignored either. While the conflict in
former Yugoslavia represents a permanent source of instability,
other situations such as the ones involving Cyprus or Algeria
are to be mentioned, tough some progress has been noted in this
last country after the elections. Regarding Libya, and its non-involvement
in the Barcelona process, the possibility stressed in the Declaration
that other countries may join the partenariat leaves the door
open for Tripoli, to join in a hopefully near future whose demand
is increasingly supported by other Arab neighbour countries.<BR>

<P>
Coming to the main issue, that is the definition of the most appropriate
instruments contributing to maintaining conditions of stability
and security in the area, needless to say, they should be included
somehow in the framework of the Barcelona process, as the main
global instrument at our disposal, with an inevitable attraction
effect on all other fora. Concerning the operational follow-up,
the key-word in that context seems to be consultation, as a further
step in the comprehensive dialogue achieved among the participants
and as a prelude to a stage in which the degree of consensus can
lead to the adoption of a politically more binding instrument,
for example a pact among all parties.<BR>

<P>
In order to fill the gap represented by the lack in the security
aspects of the Euro-Mediterranean initiative of military CBMs,
as well as to encompass the need of a balance between the European
and transatlantic contributions, the proposal presented by Minister
Corcione in Williamsburg for a partnership for peace in the Mediterranean
could be needed, bearing in mind the differences with the east
and central European countries who are candidates to the enlargement
in the Alliance. Such an initiative - if duly prepared - could
contribute through specific transparency and confidence building
measures to a better understanding between north and south, removing
prejudice or forms of misunderstanding like the ones fuelled by
the hasty declarations of the former Secretary General of NATO.
In other words a strategy of gradual openness should replace in
the public opinion misperceptions of about a western conspiracy
or about the need to preserve a European or Atlantic fortress!
<BR>

<P>
Italy, due to its geostrategic position, is willing to contribute
through the organisation of a seminar, to the consolidation of
a similar perspective, also taking into account the benefits that
specific CSBM could produce in terms of the strengthening of south-south
dialogue and integration. The only condition is to avoid the involvement
of NATO in out-of-area operations.<BR>

<P>
A few conditions have however to be fulfilled for any initiative
to be concretely valid in the long term: the absence of setbacks
in the Middle-Eastern peace process, the involvement in the search
for a solution of a country, like the United States, which is
part of the strategic balance of the area, or like Russia whose
traditional quest for access to the Mediterranean cannot be simply
ignored. Another factor to be considered is the one regarding
the French interest in maintaining a certain profile in the region,
as the recent letter addressed by President Chirac to the Secretary
General of the Arab League proves.<BR>

<P>
We can easily predict that security in the Mediterranean will
stay on the agenda for a few years, if we consider the growing
regional interdependency from the strategic point of view. This
applies in the Mediterranean not only for countries like Malta
or Cyprus, which are candidates to EU membership, but also for
all the South Mediterranean. The feeling of a shared common future
concerns to-day the Nordics who are more interested in the Mediterranean,
asking us to reciprocate our concern for the Baltics. The huge
free trade area meant to involve Europe, west and east, as well
as its southern borders will forge many links among a very numerous
population. In the new Euro-Mediterranean enterprise we must be
careful to consider the cultures, traditions and beliefs of all
the parties involved, and at the same time ambitious enough to
realise in the Mediterranean a space of common ideals.<BR>

<B>I. America Rediscovers the Mediterranean <BR>
</B>
<P>
Throughout the Cold War, and until very recently, the question
of U.S. interests in Southern Europe and the Maghreb would have
been considered eccentric. The American role in Europe was seen
almost exclusively in terms of involvement in the centre of the
continent. Similarly, the U.S. involvement in the Middle East
was focused to an overwhelming extent on the peace process on
Israelis borders, or stability in the Persian Gulf. Southern Europe
and the Maghreb -- indeed the Mediterranean itself -- figured
only peripherally in U.S. policy toward Europe and the Muslim
world. Unlike many Europeans, Americans have very little consciousness
of the Mediterranean as an area of geopolitical consequence. Washington
may have important stakes and active policies toward the Mediterranean
and its sub-regions, but these have rarely been described explicitly
in &quot;Mediterranean&quot; terms. <BR>

<P>
In the new international environment, however, practical American
interest in the Mediterranean is gathering pace very rapidly and
is giving rise to new perspectives and new policy concerns. Mediterranean
problems, broadly defined, now figure prominently in our diplomacy
in both European and Middle Eastern settings. Indeed, many of
the traditional distinctions between these regions are breaking
down in the face of new transnational challenges, and nowhere
is this new interdependence as pronounced as in southern Europe
and the Maghreb. As the following discussion suggests, these challenges
go beyond narrow security issues in which Washington has been
a long-standing actor. Migration, economic development, and the
implications of these issues for regional stability and prosperity
are at the heart of the emerging American debate about the Mediterranean.
<BR>

<P>
It has become fashionable on both sides of the Atlantic to speak
of Mediterranean problems and initiatives. From an American perspective
it is worth noting that this is less a discovery than a <I>rediscovery
</I>of a long-standing engagement. Few Europeans -- and even fewer
Americans -realise that the U.S. has been a power in the Western
Mediterranean for nearly two hundred years. Some of our oldest
diplomatic missions are in southern Europe and the Maghreb, and
our earliest experience with overseas military presence and &quot;power
projection&quot; was in the region. Our political, economic and
military presence is not simply a Cold War artefact, but rather
a product of our historical stake in developments on Europe's
southern periphery.<BR>

<P>
<B>II. Regional Interests<BR>
</B>
<P>
U.S. perspectives and interests in the Mediterranean can be viewed
in three ways: first, as an extension of the European environment
and transatlantic relations; second, as an aspect of policy toward
the Middle East (the Arab-Israeli peace process, regional stability
and relations with the Muslim world); and three, as a response
to crises and change in the region itself. Although traditional
security issues, including military risks, are clearly part of
the U.S. debate about the future of the region -- and the presence
of the Sixth Fleet reinforces this aspect of American concern
-- economic and social factors are increasingly central. In this
regard, one of the key characteristics of the western as opposed
to eastern basin of the Mediterranean is the predominance of political
and economic challenges over direct military risks. The European
Union, with its more extensive economic and social ties to the
Maghreb may be best placed to lead in Western policy toward the
&quot;south&quot;, but the U.S. will remain an important actor
with a stake in the success of Mediterranean dialogue and cooperation.
<BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>1. Europe Looks South<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
With the end of the Cold War confrontation in Europe, the focus
of transatlantic attention has shifted from the center of the
continent to the periphery, both east and south. In the east,
the U.S. has an overwhelming interest in the political and economic
development and reintegration of the former communist states.
At the same time, attention to developments in the south is essential
to the maintenance of a relevant U.S. role in European affairs.
As Southern Europe and Europe as a whole has become more concerned
with problems emanating from the Mediterranean, developments on
Europe's southern periphery have become more prominent in Washington's
approach to Europe. In short, U.S interests in the Mediterranean
are to a considerable extent derivative of Europe's own concerns
about the region.<BR>

<P>
U.S. perceptions of southern Europe itself have also evolved considerably
in recent years. Southern Europe's progressive entry into the
European mainstream in political, economic and social terms has
had a pronounced effect on the way Portugal, Spain, Italy and
Greece are seen in the eyes of American policy makers and observers.
High growth rates and marked increases in prosperity, despite
pockets of underdevelopment, have forced a reassessment of traditional
American images of southern Europe. In this context, Italy has
led the way, but the point applies in general terms to the entire
region.<BR>

<P>
Southern European countries have a long history as net exporters
of labour, and much of this economic migration has been across
the Atlantic. Today, migration to Mediterranean Europe from North
Africa, and the political consequences of this development, are
important new items on the transatlantic agenda. The Mediterranean
is among the world's most dramatic demographic, economic and cultural
fault lines. Taking a broad definition of the region, from Lisbon
to Athens, a rich North faces a poor and increasingly populous<B>
</B>South. The population around the southern and eastern shores
of the Mediterranean is growing at a rate of roughly three percent
annually. The North African population, excluding Egypt, is expected
to double by 2025, reaching roughly 140 million. If Egypt is taken
into account, the total will be in the range of 260 million. With
Turkey -- politically part of the rich West from Washington's
standpoint, but economically closer to the South -- the total
population of states around the poorer shores of the Mediterranean
will reach some 350 million not long after the end of the century.
By contrast, the total population of the current members of the
European Union will probably not exceed 300 million in the same
period. If these trends continue, the population of the southern
Mediterranean will be double that of the north by the middle of
the 21st century.<BR>

<P>
This demographic imbalance, coupled with perennial stagnation
in the southern Mediterranean economies (until recently, Turkey
was an exception, with the highest growth rates in the OECD) has
fuelled substantial migration to western Europe. Over half of
Europe's migrant labour force of seven million has arrived from
the Maghreb or Turkey. Germany alone is host to 1.5 million Turkish
&quot;guest workers,&quot; roughly a third of whom are ethnic
Kurds. In France, North Africans are the leading element in the
country's foreign population. Traditionally, economic migrants
from across the Mediterranean have gravitated toward the larger
industrial economies in western Europe. With increasing prosperity,
however, the countries of southern Europe have emerged as significant
destinations in themselves, as well as conduits for migration.
<BR>

<P>
The economic effects of migration from the south on employment
and prosperity in the north are the subject of considerable debate
on both sides of the Atlantic (and are addressed in detail elsewhere
in this study). With the rise of migration as a public policy
issue in the U.S., the European experience in this regard will
be of interest to American audiences. However, it is the internal
and external political consequences of migration across the Mediterranean
that occupy a central place in U.S. perceptions. migration to
Europe from the south has had a pronounced effect on debates about
national identity and national security, with potentially importantimplications
for U.S. policy. Anti-immigration measures have emerged as a leading
item on right-wing political agendas, especially in France, Italy
and Germany. Mainstream politicians, spurred on by the risk (and
reality) of violent spillover from instability in the Maghreb
and Turkey, have also taken up the anti-immigration cause. The
migration question has potentially enormous consequences for relations
between north and south as well as European security because it
is not simply about economics or the cost of subsidising stability
across the Mediterranean. Ultimately, the question is about culture
and a growing, if unfortunate, perception of a new cold war between
north and south, rich and poor, the West.and Islam. Washington
has a clear stake in avoiding the rise of a new ideological and
strategic divide along the lines of Samuel Huntington's controversial
notion of a &quot;clash of civilizations''. Such a clash would
severely complicate U.S. policy toward Europe and the Muslim world.
<BR>

<P>
Europe will likely seek to insulate itself from the risks associated
with migration, both real and imagined. The European right will
continue to worry about loss of national identity. Governments
will act to restrict migration (and to move cautiously on multilateral
arrangements with implications in this area, such as the Schengen
agreement) because it is politically popular to do so, and out
of fear that unrestricted migration from Europe's unstable southern
periphery will encourage social tensions and political violence
on European soil. Crackdowns on supporters of the PKK (Kurdish
Workers Party) and the Algerian Islamists attest to European concerns
on this score. The revolutions in Eastern Europe were accomplished
without battles on Western European territory. As the recent terrorist
incidents in France suggest, Europe, including southern Europe,
may not be able to insulate itself as effectively from the more
violent political transformations taking place across the Mediterranean.
<BR>

<P>
From a U.S. perspective, the perceived linkage between migration
and instability in the Maghreb has important transatlantic implications.
First, the migration issue has strengthened the position of right
wing and nationalist forces generally. This trend could ultimately
change the political landscape in Europe in ways that might well
affect transatlantic relations, including the renationalisation
of European foreign and security policies. Second, Europe's exposure
to the deepening crisis in Algeria could well lead to substantial
refugee flows or more dramatic violence against Western interests
and citizens. It is not inconceivable that the U.S. would be asked
to assist in the event of a mass evacuation or hostage crisis.
Under certain circumstances, the U.S. might wish to join with
the EU in facilitating a dialogue between the regime and its opposition
in Algiers. Moreover, and perhaps most significantly, after years
of discussions on new security arrangements in Europe focused
almost exclusively on policy toward central and eastern Europe
(and more reluctantly, the Balkans), policy makers in Lisbon,
Madrid, Paris and Rome are paying greater attention to a crisis
on their doorstep. For Washington, the price of French and southern
European cooperationin policy toward central and Eastern Europe
in the years ahead may well turn out to be more active cooperation
on problems across the Mediterranean.<BR>

<P>
U.S. policy will also have to take account of the growing role
of southern Europe in European initiatives aimed at development
and stability in the Mediterranean region. with a succession of
proposed or active initiatives, from the &quot;global&quot; concept
of a CSCM (Conference on Security and Cooperation in the Mediterranean)
to more limited exercises such as the &quot;Five plus Five&quot;
grouping in the Western Mediterranean and the Mediterranean Forum
reaching further east, southern Europe has found a new and far
more active diplomatic voice. France, as a Mediterranean power,
has also reinvigorated its southern engagement through these as
well as bilateral activities. Most recently, the EU is experiencing
three successive Mediterranean presidencies -- France, Spain and
Italy. The net result is a striking rise of activity in this sphere,
with the November 1995 Euro-Med conference shaping up as a landmark
event. The Barcelona meeting will address the political, economic
and cultural dimensions of Mediterranean dialogue, and will launch
the EU's five year program of nearly seven billion ECUs in aid
for southern and eastern Mediterranean partners.<BR>

<P>
The subject of U.S. and other extra-Mediterranean participation
at Barcelona has received considerable attention in Europe, and
various schemes for observer or guest status have been proposed.
Regardless of the outcome of the EU debate on this question --
and there is strong opposition to the idea of U.S. involvement
in France and elsewhere -Washington is likely to be supportive
of the event as well as the general aims of the EU-med dialogue.
Most of the traditional Cold War era skepticism about Mediterranean
initiatives has waned, and EU assistance across the Mediterranean
is broadly compatible with Washington's desire to strengthen the
economic and social dimensions of the Middle East peace process.
In the security realm, the fledgling NATO Mediterranean initiative,
opening Alliance dialogue with Mauritania, Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt
and Israel, is likely to take center stage. Over the longer term,
the proliferation of Mediterranean initiatives and the fact that
many of the most pressing &quot;Third Pillar&quot; issues on the
transatlantic agenda (e.g., international crime, migration and
refugees, terrorism, drug smuggling) have direct relevance to
the Mediterranean environment, argues for more serious and deliberate
consideration of U.S. and European roles in policy toward the
region.<BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>2. The Middle Eastern Dimension <BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
Traditionally, U.S. strategic thinking has accorded considerable
importance to the Mediterranean and its hinterlands as routes
for power projection in areas of key interest such as the Persian
Gulf. Indeed, in logistical terms, the Mediterranean, including
southern Europe and the Maghreb, may be described as the &quot;place
where the Persian Gulf begins.&quot; This reality was clearly
demonstrated during the last Gulf war, in which some 90 percent
of the troops, equipment and materiel sent to the region went
through or over the Mediterranean. Access to bases and the ability
to overfly national airspace in the western Mediterranean remains
essential to American freedom of action in the greater Middle
East and, again, the experience of the Gulf war points to the
role of southern European countries in this regard. Two factors
are likely to shape the character of this sort of security cooperation
in the future. First, the negative reaction of public opinion
in the Maghreb to Western intervention in the Middle East will
continue to cloud the prospects for cooperation with regimes in
the region. It will also complicate the calculus of southern European
allies in times of crisis. As the Gulf experience suggests, countries
such as Spain and Portugal will have to weigh carefully the costs
and benefits of cooperation in the face of strong public reaction
across the Mediterranean. Second, the prospect of the spread of
weapons of mass destruction and the means for their delivery at
longer ranges makes this an increasingly tangible, not just theoretical,
strategic problem. Ballistic missiles capable of reaching southern
European capitals from the southern and eastern shores of the
Mediterranean, in addition to the existing potential for terrorism,
suggest that the era of southern European &quot;sanctuarisation&quot;
is drawing to a close. Europe, especially southern Europe is increasingly
exposed to the retaliatory consequences of U.S. and Western actions
in the Middle East.<BR>

<P>
Beyond these overt security concerns, the Mediterranean is also
acquiring new importance in the context of U.S. economic and political
interests in the Middle East. Although the peace process is within
the Mediterranean space in the strict, geographic sense, American
policy makers tend not to see the activity in Mediterranean terms.
Indeed, until very recently, there has been considerable reluctance
to envision a more active European role in the process. But with
significant breakthroughs on the Palestinian and Jordanian tracks,
and the need to reinforce these agreements in economic terms,
the European role has become essential. Moreover, with the higher
profile of Morocco and Tunisia in the peace process, including
the multilateral track, the center of gravity in Arab-Israeli
relations has shifted to a measurable degree. In the multilateral
negotiations on Arms Control and regional Security (ACRS), for
example, the question of sub-regional (e.g., North African) concerns
and arrangements has become increasingly important over the course
of the talks. In fact, the security principles and confidence
building measures under discussion in ACRS closely parallel the
discussion of CSCE-type arrangements for the Mediterranean. In
short, as Europe and the Maghreb have become more actively involved
in Arab-Israeli questions, the peace process has acquired a more
significant Mediterranean dimension.<BR>

<P>
In functional terms, U.S. policy over the past few years has devoted
considerable attention to ways of broadening and deepening Middle
East peace. To date the achievements of the peace processes in
the region have been confined largely to the level of high politics,
with few tangible benefits for Middle Eastern societies. The Middle
East Economic Summit in Casablanca and its follow-on in Amman,
and the U.S. proposal for a Middle East/North Africa Development
Bank, reflect an interest in developing the economic dimension
of the process, with the aim of enlarging the constituency for
peace. The Maghreb is poised to play a central role in this context
as a result of its close economic relationship with the EU and
the &quot;moderating role&quot; of Morocco and Tunisia in Arab
affairs.<BR>

<P>
Although the U.S. is a secondary economic actor in the Maghreb,
the scope of American investment and financial ties to the region
is significant, especially in the energy sector. U.S. policy makers
and observers are aware of the pronounced southern European dependency
on natural gas supplies from North Africa, a dependency which
is set to increase with the construction of additional high capacity
pipelines in the central and western Mediterranean. The U.S. shares
a systemic, if indirect, interest in the economic and political
implications of new energy infrastructure in North Africa and
across the Mediterranean. Even in the face of continued instability
and perhaps radical change in Algeria, it is arguable that new
pipelines are likely to promote useful interdependence rather
than simply deepening vulnerabilities.<B><FONT SIZE=2>3. Arc of
Crisis or Arc of Change?<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
The area stretching from the Western Sahara to Turkey's Middle
Eastern borders is often described as an &quot;arc of crisis.&quot;
A cursory survey of contemporary crises and potential flash points
may support this description. Indeed, from the point of view of
American policy makers there can be little doubt that the Algerian
crisis (and Turkey's internal and external challenges, at the
other end of the Mediterranean) are driving perceptions about
the region, and much of the new interest in the Mediterranean
flows from its role as a center of tension and conflict. A more
meaningful analysis might look to the underlying forces of change,
both internal and external, across a region in the midst of substantial
and often violent change.<BR>

<P>
From the U.S. perspective the political challenge posed by Islamist
movements in Algeria and elsewhere in the Maghreb is not simply
regional but systemic. U.S. policy makers have devoted a good
deal of energy to the problem of policy toward political Islam.
Notwithstanding our experience in Iran, the preference of the
past few years has been for a more sophisticated approach which
distinguishes between the revival of Islam at the cultural and
religious level, the emergence of Islam as a political force,
and the existence of radical Islamic movements with strong anti-democratic
and anti-Western views. U.S. interests are in no sense threatened
by Islam as a religion, or even by Islam as a focus for political
opposition to regimes suffering from a lack of competence or legitimacy.
On the other hand, U.S. interests would be threatened by the advent
of regimes whose Islamist agenda leads them to violate international
norms in their internal and external behavior.
<P>
The rise of political Islam as the most potent expression of political
opposition around the southern and eastern shores of the Mediterranean,
combined with the mishandling of Islamist movements by existing
regimes, has resulted in growing insecurity and instability, with
no clear end in sight. The turmoil in Algeria, which has claimed
at least 40,000 victims, is the most dramatic case. Egypt faces
a similarly critical, if less overt Islamist challenge.The triumph
of political Islam in either country -- and some observers regard
this as a foregone conclusion in Algeria -- would send shock waves
throughout the Muslim world, including Muslim communities in Europe.
Under these circumstances, the stability of Morocco, Tunisia and
Libya could not be taken for granted. In the eastern Mediterranean,
remote from the Maghreb but prominent in the minds of American
observers, secular Turkey is under mounting pressure from Islamists
(and Turkish nationalists) within the political system. Many analysts
on both sides of the Atlantic believe that a m<I>aodus vivendi
</I>would be possible with new Islamic regimes, particularly those
that might come to power through non-violent means. Others would
prefer not to see this political experiment conducted on their
doorstep, not least because of the potentially serious implications
for refugee flows and regional security.<BR>

<P>
Algeria is the most dramatic example of the problems of legitimacy
and pervasive insecurity to be found to greater or lesser degree
in virtually all of the southern Mediterranean states. The demographic
pressures noted earlier in the context of migration have produced
a growing cohort of half-educated, unemployed young people with
few outlets for their economic, political and social aspirations.
The perceived gap between aspirations and reality in maghrebi
societies may well be heightened by proximity to Europe and the
availability of European television and other media.<BR>

<P>
Much of the current Western approach to the problems of these
societies assumes a close connection between economic development,
prosperity, and political stability. Over the long-term, this
is likely to be the case. In the near-term, the problem of conflicting
political and economic time-frames may be more acute. It is worth
noting here that among Maghrebi economies, Morocco has the worst
distribution of income, followed by Tunisia. By contrast, Algeria
has traditionally had the best distribution of income. Admittedly,
this comparison tells us very little. But it does suggest that
the linkage between economic circumstances and political stability
is more complex than is often assumed when aid and reform measures
are debated. The Algerian experience also suggests that in some
cases the crisis of political legitimacy and social dissatisfaction
may be beyond economic solutions. Algeria faces an immediate political
crisis that demands political rather than economic (or security)
remedies.<BR>

<P>
As policy makers in southern Europe and elsewhere in the EU shape
a more active policy toward the non-EU Mediterranean states they
are likely to confront more directly the relationship between
economic and political factors in promoting stability. Aid and
investment strategies are popular topics for discussion with Maghrebi
governments. Economic and (above all) political reform are far
more difficult subjects. Perhaps because of distance or less direct
exposure to events in the region, American observers have been
somewhat more inclined than their European counterparts to insist
on the need to address problems of political legitimacy and democratisation
as part of a strategy toward the &quot;south&quot;. More serious
thinking also needs to be done on both sides of the Atlantic,
as well as within the Maghreb itself, about the risks and stresses
associated with reform in the near-term, in the context of stability
as a longer-term objective. Southern European and Maghrebi interests
may well diverge if the objective is to promote growth, increase
employment, and reduce migration -- but with substantial risks
for regime stability in the near term as a result of the elimination
of subsidies, the closure of state enterprises, and a general
opening to Western societies. <BR>

<P>
An additional challenge for the EU is likely to flow from the
need to balance competing needs for assistance in the south and
the east, as well as between the Maghreb and southern Europe,
still a leading consumer of EU funds. The extent and character
of the EU's aid and investment in the Maghreb in the years ahead
may be strongly influenced by the evolution of European integration,
including the pace of enlargement to the east. What resources
will be available to promote development and stability in the
south? How might the entry of new members and freer movement of
labour within a reunited Europe influence the supply and demand
for labour in western Europe, and thus the incentives for economic
migration from across the Mediterranean? The pattern of American
aid and investment on Europe's southern and eastern periphery
may be acontributing factor in this equation, and argues for more
active transatlantic coordination.<BR>

<P>
<B>III. Overall observations and conclusions<BR>
</B>
<P>
The relationship between southern Europe and the Maghreb is at
the center of a number of key social, political, economic and
security issues affecting Europe and the Middle East. As this
brief discussion suggests, the U.S. has a strong stake in developments
on both sides of the Mediterranean, and will have a keen and continuing
interest in efforts to address transnational challenges in the
region. Overall, and from an American perspective, the geopolitical
setting for debate over specific policy questions, including migration,
economic growth and north-south dialogue, is likely to be shaped
by three trends.<BR>

<P>
First, the recent attention to Mediterranean security, broadly
defined, is likely to continue and perhaps intensify as events
in Algeria and elsewhere confirm the region's position as an arc
of crisis -- and more importantly -- an &quot;arc of change&quot;.
Fundamental questions of political legitimacy, economic potential
and international relations are being played out on Europe's southern
periphery. Outcomes across the Mediterranean will have significant
consequences for societies along the northern shore, not least
in the areas of migration, energy, and social cohesion. The Mediterranean,
in particular the western Mediterranean, exemplifies the post-Cold
War convergence between what had previously be seen as quite separate
European and Middle Eastern environments. <BR>

<P>
Second, southern European countries will continue to find Mediterranean
issues and initiatives a particularly attractive outlet for their
growing diplomatic activism within the EU and elsewhere. Moreover,
the existence of tangible problems in the south is also likely
to compel the attention of larger European powers, certainly France
and possibly Germany. This trend is increasingly compatible with
U.S. interests in Europe and the Middle East, and Washington can
be expected to support Mediterranean initiatives emanating from
the EU as well as NATO. With regard to southern Europe itself,
American policy has moved steadily towards treating southern Europe
in a less distinctive fashion, that is, as an increasingly active
part of the European mainstream. A succession of Mediterranean
EU presidencies has helped to advance this trend on a practical
level.<BR>

<P>
Finally, shared stakes in Mediterranean developments together
with shared (if not always equal or symmetrical) interests and
policy instruments suggest the need for more active transatlantic
cooperation on problems in the region. Europe may properly play
a leading role in policy toward the southern shores of the Mediterranean,
where political and economic problems predominate. But it would
be an error for the U.S, to be engaged actively only in the security
realm. There is a need for a more concerted approach across the
full range of issues facing the region, from Algeria and political
Islam, to development assistance and discussion of lessons to
be learned from relevant public policy problems elsewhere. There
is already a trend towards the appearance of Mediterranean issues,
as well as functional issues with special significance for the
region, on official and unofficial transatlantic agendas. It is
a trend worth encouraging.<BR>

<P>
There was a time the Europeans considered their security and also
their identity as being dependent on the formation of their own
foreign and security policy independently of the United States.
At present times, this is no longer true. Current relations between
the governments of the European Union and the United States are
hardly the same as they were a decade ago. It is not easy to define
such relations, but it is clear that today European identity and
security are not linked to dissociating European foreign and security
policies from the foreign and security policy of the United States.
The renewed European endorsement of the United States as the provider
of last resort of international security in the Bosnian war is
proof of such a change. In the Balkans, Wahington has again been
put in the role of security provider of last resort of the international
system, with the consent and support of European governments.

<P>
In line with such a re-orientation of European attitudes, hurrying
to formulate a foreign and security common policy (FSCP) and its
institutionalisation is turning out to be of little importance
to the Europeans. 
<P>
At the same time, it is widely admitted that more co-operation
and even a new common policy is needed in another security area:
the internal one. Such a new security co-operation has a strong
international dimension and no state can present itself as the
provider of last resort in such a field. The international dimension
of internal security is not a worry only for the Europeans, but
for all the states of the world. It is also a problem to be solved
by international co-operation. Two solemn documents recently signed
by European Union and its special partners (the traditional major
ally, the United States, and the Mediterranean neighbours) make
important declarations about this problem. The documents are the
New Transatlantic Agenda, signed in Madrid on December 1996, and
the Barcelona Declaration on the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership,
signed in the Catalan town just a few weeks before the other document.
<BR>

<P>
&quot;New dimensions of security&quot; is a frequently used term
in the current vocabulary of international relations. In past
years, researchers and professionals have repeatedly called attention
to the multiple dimension of security in today's world. Concepts
like societal security, cultural security and environmental security
are increasingly used. This paper focuses on one of the &quot;new
dimensions&quot; and the reason why internal security has approached
foreign security as an important object of intergovernmental co-operation
and as an issue of the global system.<BR>

<P>
Firstly, the paper deals with the addition of internal security
to external security in the agenda of the European Union. It deals
with the development of co-operation in justice and home affairs
(JHA) and wih the difficult (or failed) development of FSCP. 
<P>
The second subject of the paper is the nature of EU-US relations
and the presence of co-operation on international security in
the New Transatlantic Agenda. Thirdly, the paper examines the
Barcelona Declaration and the presence of co-operation on internal
security in this document. The argument of the paper is that a
single group of causes is at the origin of the presence of this
security dimension in all the most important documents of contemporary
diplomacy.<BR>

<H1>From EPC to FSCP: re-conceptualising foreign policy and security
from the European experience<BR>
</H1>

<P>
In the first fifteen years of its existence, co-operation in foreign
policy achieved better results in the organisational, institutional
and political domain than it from Maastricht up to the present.
Institutional and political results obtained in the initial period,
from the 1969 Summit in The Hague to the signature of the Single
European Act in 1985, have all not been exciting, but some of
them have been important.<BR>

<P>
If to carry out the communitarisation of foreign policy means
to progressing from 0 to 100, in the earliest fifteen years communitarisation
progressed from 0 to 10; in the following period -though moving
forward- it covered less distance. In the first period of co-operation,
committees and working groups were brought into existence; important
declarations, such as the famous Declaration on European Identity,
were issued; co-operation was set out on at the United Nations.
Finally, in 1986 the Secretariat for Political Co-operation was
created, but in 1992 the Maastricht Treaty canceled it out (See:
Allen, Rummel and Wessels, 1982; Longo, 1995; Schouteete, 1980).
<BR>

<P>
Dates are important. At the time of the signing of the Single
European Act, in 1985, the short Gorbachev era was just starting
and the Soviet Union was in trouble, though Europeans did not
realise they had left behind the so-called Second cold war (See:
Kaldor, 1990). By the time of Maastricht, in 1992, the Gorbachev
era was over, as was the Soviet Union.<BR>

<P>
What of importance for Europe and the common foreign policy took
place in the world at that time? The answer is that the world
went through two changes and, because of these, Community co-operation
in foreign policy lost its former nature and principal raison
d'etre, at least till now. However, not only EU common foreign
policy but all national foreign policies are currently in a condition
of crisis,. The term 'foreign policy' may even sound obsolete
today. To say the least, foreign policy is something very different
today from what it was yesterday.<BR>

<P>
As we have said, the world changed twice in the last few years.
The first change was that the Soviet Union disappeared and, with
it, like cold war, bipolar international politics, and so on (See,
for instance: Haftendorn and Tuschoff, 1993; Lellouche, 1992).
In addition a given Atlantic politics and typical American foreign
policy disappeared, i.e. Atlantic politics as the politics of
opposition of the Western capitalist world to the Communist bloc.
The American foreign policy of forwarding American hegemony in
the international system in rivalry to the Soviet government also
broke up.<BR>

<P>
What is there instead of Atlantic politics? The answer is &quot;trans-Atlantic
politics&quot;, in process of definition since the first Transatlantic
Declaration signed in November 1990. What is there instead of
the old American foreign policy of &quot;hegemony with rivalry&quot;
with the Soviet Union? The answear is &quot;the new American policy
of hegemony with shared responsabilities&quot; with Japan and
the European allies, which also is in process of definition.<BR>

<P>
Does this change mean something to the foreign policy of the European
Union? Obviously, yes. It means a lot. However, it is better to
clearing from the outset an ambiguity. Western European integration
has been put in relation with the Est-West divide of the international
system. Integration used to be considered chiefly as something
formented on the two sides of the Atlantic to reinvigorate Europe
and rescue it from falling into communism and under the control
of the Soviet Union. Such an interpretation is to be rejected
as a reductive theory of the causes and evolution of the European
integration process. It is not in this sense that the demise of
the Soviet Union has changed the process of foreign policy communitarisation.
<P>
The point is that the anti-American motive to common foreign policy
has been much stronger than the anti-Soviet one. The anti-Americanism
of the European integration process has been commonly interpreted
as being of an economic nature. This is a partial vision of reality.
Customs union, economic and, nowadays, monetary integration is
and always has been strongly motivated in Europe by the need to
counter American strength in the world economy. Integration is
for the Europeans the condition for prevailing in industrial and
monetary competition with the Americans and, obviously, also with
the Japanese (See: Bourrinet, 1987; Khaler, 1995; Schwok, 1991).
Since the <I>defi americain</I> of the early 1960s, nobody has
disputed this. But such an argument fits also in with co-operation
in the field of foreign and security policy. Indeed, in the 1970s
and early 1980s, European co-operation in foreign policy got a
decisive push from the anti-American claims of many social, political
and even governmental actors in Europe. It is enough to recall
the Declaration on European Identity, issued in 1973 by EC foreign
affairs ministries, and the Kissinger's anger at it. This early
- some would say premature - result of the anti-American looming
of EPC is a good proof of the fact that EPC was fuelled mostly
by the aspiration of European governments to dissociate themselvesfrom
important aspects of the American foreign policy of the time.
As examples of this &quot;aspiration to dissociate&quot; the following
cases may be recorded:<BR>

<UL>
<LI>dissociation from the war in Vietnam ( then reculing its end)
by opposing it with such declarations as the Declaration on European
identity; 
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>dissociation from the Middle-East and oil policies followed
by the American government in the late 1960s and early 1970s,
by presenting the Euro-Arab dialogue as an alternative to the
Washington diplomacy of confrontation with the oil producing and
exporting countries; 
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>dissociation from the European security policy as outlined
by the Pentagon by opposing it with Ostpolitik and the Helsinki
process; 
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>dissociation from the invasion of Grenada, the embargo on
Nicaragua, and the Latin-American policy of the Reagan Administration
by opposing it with initiatives like the San Jos&egrave; conference
explicitly aimed at creating ties between Europe and the Central
American countries, in spite of the fact that such ties had never
existed before; 
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>dissociation from the boycott of the Siberian pipeline and
the Moscow Olympic Games proclaimed by Washington; (by mere disobedience);

</UL>

<UL>
<LI>dissociation from the hard anti-Soviet stance wanted by the
United States in the CSCE follow-up conferences by showing fair
co-ordination among diplomats of the EC countries in all the meetings
of the Helsinki process. 
</UL>

<P>
It may be ojected that the list of anti-American declarations
and actions of EC countries may be countered by a similar list
of anti-Soviet positions. But this objection is not decisive.
The fact is that, when the EPC venture started, the European governments
already had appropriate diplomatic and strategic institutions
- namely, the Atlantic Pact and NATO - to neutralise the Soviet
threat. They did not enter into the EPC process either to substitute
those institutions as inefficient instruments of defence against
the Soviet enemy or to supplement them with other instruments.
At that time, the anti-Soviet stance of the European governments
was almost the same as the anti-Soviet stance of the American
government. In other words, the &quot;value added&quot; by the
EPC to the foreign policies of the European countries was not
anti-Sovietism; rather, it was dissociation from important aspects
of American foreign policy.
<P>
Briefly, in the 1970s and 1980s, European governments considered
it advantageous to themselves to loosen and reduce ties with their
American ally, which had turned uneasy. In the 1990s, instead,
that ally is turning to be an easy ally again (See: Peterson and
Ward, 1995). At the same time, co-operation in foreign and security
policy is becoming more difficult. Such co-operation, always inherently
difficult, appears today to be more difficult than ever because
it is largely purposeless - at least in the international security
area - until a re-conceptualisation of its nature is appropriately
made.<BR>

<P>
In 1991 foreign policy co-operation lost its raison d'&egrave;tre
because the end of the Soviet Union removed almost all the reasons
for dissociating European diplomacy from important aspects of
American diplomacy and strategy. Even during the Gorbachev era
- when the EU states invented the common defence policy with the
Single European Act, and later, when they invented the common
security policy with the Treaty of European Union - effective
progress toward the reorganisation of the Western European Union
(WEU) had been small.<BR>

<P>
The dissolution of the Warsaw Pact caused anxiety and fear amongthe
Europeans and rushed them to find to remedies and make plans for
what they had never been able to accomplish, i.e. the creation
of common defence structures. It forced them to consider it feasible
to take upon themselves the burden of greater military expenses,
with the blessing sight of the Washington government. However,
because the American economy was overheated at that time, to slim
NATO down by reducing the number and size of the American military
bases in Europe was a decision also in the interest of United
States (See: Attin&agrave;, 1993 b; Hyde-Price, 1991; Mcardle
Kelleher, 1993; Smith, 1993). After a short time, however, the
problem of security in Central and Eastern Europe was revealed
to be not so big as to push for the immediate creation of new
structures for common defence. After all, Central and East European
states as well as the post-Soviet states (C.I.S.) had enough domestic
problems to deal with, and no time to ignite international violence.
This could be expected unless the domestic problems of those nations
turned into violence, and domestic violence turned into international
war (See: Barb&egrave;, 1995; Braillard, 1995). The Balkans fitted
this condition, but before turning to this case we have to come
back to the second great change undergone by the world. <BR>

<P>
If the fall of the Soviet Union and its consequence for the political
organisation of the international system - i.e., the end of the
rivalry between the hegemon of the system (the United States)
and its poorer (therefore, improbable) challenger (the Soviet
Union) - may be considered a sudden change, the second one is
not a sudden change but has been creeping up on us gradually,
even if it has only been defined recently.<BR>

<P>
In a few words, the world of today is the world of globalisation
and not only of interdependence. It is the world of easy and intense
mobility and communication; the world of imperious demands for
individual and collective human rights; the world of the third
and the widest wave of democratisation; the world of fast imitation
and, at least to a certain extent, unavoidable homogenisation
of societies and cultures (See, for instance, Kennedy, 1993).
It is also the opposite of all these aspects: it is the world
of fragmentation, discontinuouity and individuation; and the world
of strenuous and even violent reaction of individuals (single
persons, groups and cultures) against the risk of being overwhelmed
by the rest of the world in a situation in which individuals realise
they cannot &quot;shut the door&quot; separating them from the
aliens (See, for instance: Friedman, 1994; Mlinar, 1992; Robertson,
1992).
<P>
In such a world, the state has lost the ability to control its
borders. It is wonder that it lacks the same ability to make foreign
and security policy as it had before such a change took effect
(See, for example: Attin&agrave;, 1993 a; Camilleri and Falk,
1992; McGrew and Lewis, 1992). In spite of this change, the state
is safe in the present international system as it has never been
before.
<P>
Everything will blow up in the air if someone decides to use nuclear
weapons, but - apart from this circumstance - no state has a reasonable
chance of being destroyed by arms used by other states. From 1945
up to the present, no state has been destroyed by military invasion.
When a state risked destruction by military invasion, someone
intervened to rescue it. Some states have died in violence in
the contemporary international system, but this was by &quot;suicide&quot;,
that is by disintegrating themselves. There are - in my knowledge
- only four divergent cases, which may be easily explained. Two
cases - South Vietnam and East Germany - were the halves of divided
states and wanted to be somehow integrated to the other half (the
same is expected to occur to the two Koreas). The two remaining
cases - East Timor and Western Sahara - were in a nascent state
and were killed almost on the verge of becoming states. Incidentally,
it may be noted also that violent disintegration is not the only
form of state disappearance. Disintegration may be &quot;smooth&quot;
- as in the case of the Soviet Union - and peaceful - as in the
Czechslovak case. State disappearance may also occur by voluntary
bilateral or multilateral integration, but no real case is known
in the contemporary international system, apart from the building
of the European Union.<BR>

<P>
The present condition of international security of states may
be explained only by making reference to a fundamental value change
in the international system. The value change is that international
security (i.e. security of states as territorial entities) is
today a collective good, not simply an individual one. This is
new and peculiar to the contemporary international system. It
was not so in past international systems. In the past the persistence
of the international system, as opposed to the persistence of
any single state was a collective good; the plurality of states
was to be assured and the formation of world empires avoided,
but the existence of single states - especially small or middle
powers - was not to be necessarily preserved. The division and
the annexation of the whole territory of a state by other states
was not excluded as contrary to the basic principles of the international
system of the time as it is excluded in the contemporary international
system.<BR>

<P>
An individual good is something that individuals secure for themselves
mainly by their own means. A collective good, instead, is something
individuals benefit from mainly because an authority makes it
available to all; individuals have only to comply with a few obligations
to avoid &quot;wasting&quot; the good. In national political systems,
the authority that supplies public goods is an institution (the
executive or a state agency). In the international political system,
instead, the authority is the hegemonic (or global) power and/or
an institution. Authors of the hegemonic theory of international
politics like Gilpin (1981), Modelski (1978) and - espcially on
collective goods - Kindleberger (1970 and 1988), have focused
on certain public goods provided by the leading power to the system
such as currency for international exchange and freedom of circulation
for international trade. In the contemporary international system,
there are at least two important changes regarding collective
goods: one is the inclusion of territorial security among the
collective goods of the system; the other one is the legitimation
role of the United Nations in the field of international security,
i.e. the U.N. role of legitimating the actions of the hegemonic
state (the United States), no matter what the content of the U.N.
Charter and what may be best for the world.<BR>

<P>
In the past, state security was acquired through national military
power and/or military alliances with the strongest state(s). In
the contemporary international system, national security is mainly
and in the last resort defended by the &quot;governmental institutions&quot;
of the system, i.e. by the United States and the United Nations.
For that reason, in current international politics making military
alliances is becoming an obsolate instrument of foreign policy.
Indeed, the number of military alliances created in the last ten
years is near to zero. The last big wave of military alliance
creation took place at the time of the so-called Second cold war
with the military pacts signed by Brezhnev's Soviet Union and
certain so-called communist states in Africa and the Arab Peninsula.
The only important exception to this decaying importance of military
alliances is Nato. It is not difficult to explain why this is
so. In the contemporary international system, only four cases
can be counted as cases of real threat to the existence of a &quot;formed&quot;
(as opposed to &quot;nascent&quot;) state by invading its territory:
they are the invasion of South Korea by North Korea, the invasion
of South Vietnam by North Vietnam, the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq,
and the invasion of Bosnia by Croatia in 1995. Other cases of
military occupation - for example, in the Middle East - can be
counted; but in those cases territorial offence was neither deliberately
intended to produce the death of the offended state nor produced
such a result unintentionally. The rescue of three attacked and
threatened states (South Korea, Kuwait and Bosnia) was carried
out by the United States under the legitimating flag of the United
Nations. In the fourth case (South Vietnam), the United States
failed as much in military intervention as in obtaining United
Nations legitimation certainly because Soviet Union had understood
the error of its conduct in the Korean affair.<BR>

<P>
It is now clear why NATO is alive and in good health. Indeed,
it grows toward the East with the Partnership for Peace and even
considers it possible to extend to the South (see the proposal
made to certain Maghreb countries in 1995). The fact is that NATO
is not a traditional military alliance. It has gradually assumed
the nature of the major military instrument of Pax Americana in
the enlarged European region. However, it is not an all-purpose
military instrument in the hand of the United States. European
allies may at any time &quot;dissociate&quot;themselves, and also
resort to the reinvigoration of the Western European Union.<BR>

<P>
The principle of territorial integrity (that is: no state be invaded
and &quot;killed&quot; by another state) goes together with the
principle of non-intervention. Taken together, such principles
imply that a state may disintegrate into many fragments without
actions by other states. The two principles are so strong today
as to be valid also for each of the fragments fallen out of a
disintegrated state, whatever the &quot;living conditions&quot;
of the fragments. 
<P>
One example is near to us. No state has been ready to intervene
to stop mass killings in Bosnia, a fragment state fallen out of
the disintegration of Jugoslavia, always itself on the verge of
exploding and subdividing in fragments. 
<P>
This is because in our international system disintegration is
allowed and no state is legitimised to impede the disintegration
process of another state by direct military intervention. But
when the Croatian army entered Bosnia to annex a piece of land
and risked producing the death of Bosnia by &quot;inviting&quot;
others (i.e. Serbia) to annex other pieces of Bosnian land, at
that time the political organisation of the international system
mobilised and reacted as, four years before, it had reacted to
the Iraq's invasion of Kuwait though Bosnia has no oil!<BR>

<P>
Mobilisation of the political organisation of the international
system means that the &quot;constitutional&quot; rules and institutions
(See: Attin&agrave;, 1989 and 1991) and the leading state(s) of
the system enter in action. In this case, the United States intervened
in Bosnia - as they had done in Kuwait and also in Korea - with
the legitimation of the United Nations, without giving to the
United Nations the control of the operations.
<P>
Also in the present international system of &quot;hegemony without
rivalry&quot;, the United States are taking on themselves the
role of security provider of last resort and they do so without
involving European allies in operations and alignments they dislike.
In such circumstances, the low interest of EU countries in deepening
the FSCP is hardly surprising.<BR>

<H1>International crime and police co-operation in the European
Union<BR>
</H1>

<P>
So far we have seen how the first and second change of world conditions
add toghether in negatively affecting the evolution of FSCP. At
the same time, the two changes affect the internal security of
states, forward the &quot;international dimension&quot; of internal
security and favour the emergence and development of the Third
Pillar in EU co-operation. Whoever accepts the claim of re-conceptualising
foreign policy, may find valuable hints in the Maastrich process.
<BR>

<P>
Since globalisation and interdependence are important characters
of the present world, especially in the economic and social fields,
foreign policy is made by the European governments, above all,
through measures for building monetary union, restructuring economic
relations with neighboring countries (the Central and Eastern
European Countries and the Mediterranean countries) and policing
state borders. It may be said that foreign and security policy
is made also with the First and the Third Pillar, and - in specific
matters - even better than with the Second one: the first to handle
the problems of economic co-operation and competition, the third
to deal with issues like international migrations (See: Collinson,
1993; Waever et al., 1993) and international crime (See: Ahnfelt
and From, 1993).<BR>

<P>
The world has problems which in their origin, growth and, solution
exceed national borders and capacities. More exactly, they cannot
be controlled and solved by state legislation and national authoritative
decisions. Their solution depends on international and supranational
regulation. This is true in such different fields as environment
(pollution), demography (migrations), health (epidemics) and public
security (organised crime, illegal business, trade in persons).
Because of the effects of interconnection that the process of
globalisation has on the politics of almost all contemporary states,
governments are able to exert the old and new functions of public
security, economic growth, health protection, social security,
etc., only if they resort to international co-operation and co-ordination.

<P>
Certain issues, affected by the globalisation process, are more
efficiently controlled by governments when they agree to co-ordinate
national policies with multilateral international policies and
regulations. Other issues - either produced or heavily conditioned
by the globalisation process - can be solved only if they enter
the agenda of co-operation at the level of the global system or,
at least, at the level of regional systems. The inclusion of a
problem in the international agenda means that the problem is
the object of the formulation of international legal norms, the
creation of competent international institutions or the attribution
of competence to already existing international institutions (See
Livingston, 1992): in other words, their solution may only be
made by issuing a world public policy.<BR>

<P>
In such a perspective, the effects of the accomplishment of the
four freedoms, scheduled in the Treaty of Rome, and of the single
market, scheduled in the Treatry of Maastricht, are not the only
reason for police co-operation in the European Union. Indeed,
they add to the effects of globalisation in causing the common
problem of protection from illegal and criminal actions in the
territory of the Union and across its borders. Co-operation in
public security is not only an instrument to protect public and
social order from the effects of opening internal borders; it
is an instrument to defend from one of the unwanted effects of
globalisation, that is international crime.<BR>

<P>
The most important form of international crime today is organised
crime, i.e. groups of people equipped with a stable, mostly hierarchical
organisation, which perpetrate illegal actions, usually using
violent means, in order to enrich themselves without consideration
for international frontiers. Important international organised
crime groups are the Mafias (Sicilian, American and Russian Mafia),
the Japanese Yakuza, the Colombian drug cartels of Medellin and
Cali, the Chinese Triads. But the phenomenon is only partially
known, and in continuous evolution. Certainly, these groups are
not unitary organisations but networks of homogeneous, loosely
subordinated groups.<BR>

<P>
An organisation may prefer to exploit a particular sector more
than others, but no orgnised crime body neglects drug trafficking,
arms trade, prostitution, people trade and international money
laundrering - the last being the natural complement of all kinds
of criminal activity, including traditional ones behind state
borders (extortion, usury, etc.).<BR>

<P>
In to the fight against international crime, whether organised
or not, there is no alternative than to collaborate and co-ordinate
national police and judiciary action. To improve such co-ordination,
agencies like Interpol and the new Europol have been constituted.
But the constitution and the operation of these agencies face
great obstacles and problems, because states have peculiar penal
law codes and institutes; they regulate police operations (like,
for instance, telephone controls, collection of information and
preventive incarceration) in very different ways.<BR>

<P>
International police co-operation has a long tradition. When crime
assumed the character of an international phenomenon, the police
responded with cross-border co-operation. During the first half
of the present century such co-operation was of an informal nature
and not based on formal agreements and conventions. The situation
changed significantly in the 1950s. Since 1956, Interpol has been
the key organisation for international police collaboration. Towards
the end of the 1950s, two important criminal law conventions -
one on Extradition (1957), the other on Legal Aid (1959) - were
formulated under the auspices of the Council of Europe (See: Gianaris,
1992-1993).<BR>

<P>
Almost all the states of the world are members of Interpol. About
eighty police agents of different countries work at the headquarters
of the organisation in the French city of Lyon while in the national
capitals of the member countries the CNOs (Central National Offices)
operate with local police officers. These offices communicate
directly for information exchange. The central data bank in Lyon
receives and gives information and data. This is what Interpol
mainly does (See: Bresler,1993; Valleix, 1984).<BR>

<P>
So, police co-operation is not new but its growth in recent times
has been very great and, obviously, related to the escalation
of international crime. Regarding EU countries, judiciary and
police co-operation started in the 1970s to fight terrorism. Recent
acceleration of co-operation, by contrast, is linked to the upsurge
of drug-related crimes as well as to the control of immigration
and prevention of illegal immigration (Ahnfelt and From, 1993;
Benyon, 1994; Fijnaut, 1994).<BR>

<P>
On German initiative, the need for police co-operation in the
EU has been discussed since the beginning of the 197Os. (See:
Benyon, 1992; de Boer and Walker, 1992). The extent of political
terrorism experienced by several member states led to the creation
of TREVI Group. This intergovemmental forum of EC Ministries of
Justice and Home Affairs was established by the European Council
in 1975 to co-ordinate anti-terrorism measures. TREVI's organisational
structure had three co-ordinated levels: ministerial, top civil
servant and the working group level. The Presidency of TREVI followed
the Presidency of the EC. 
<P>
The working groups, composed of civil servants and police officers,
were responsible for preparatory work on matters to be discussed
at higher level meetings, as well as for carrying out research
and planning at the request of the politicians. In 1991 the Commission
and the Secretariat of the Council of Ministers were permitted
to participate as observers in the working group responsible for
preparatory work on the removal of border controls within the
Community. With the construction of the Third Pillar, TREVI structures
have been progressively converted into structures of the Pillar
(See: Adam, 1994).<BR>

<P>
Since November 1993 and the coming into force of the Maastricht
Treaty, the EU's Council of Interior and Justice Ministers has
co-ordinated a number of actions on the basis of Article K (Title
VI on &quot;Co-operation in the Fiuds of Justice and Home Affairs&quot;)
of the Maastricht Treaty (See: den Boer, 1995; Vilarino Pintos,
1994). Article K l. identifies nine areas as &quot;matters of
common interest&quot;: (1) asylum policy; (2) rules governing
the crossing by persons of the external borders of the Member
States and the exercise of controls thereon; (3) immigration policy
and policy regarding nationals of third countries; (4) combating
drug addiction in so far as this is not covered by (7) to (9);
(5) combating fraud on an international scale in so far as this
is not covered by (7) to (9); (6) judicial co-operation in civil
matters; (7) judicial co-operation in criminal matters; (8) customs
co-operation; (9) police co-operation for the purposes of preventing
and combating terrorism, unlawful drug trafficking and other serious
forms of international crime, including if necessary certain aspects
of customs co-operation, in connection with the organisation of
a Union-wide system for exchanging information within a European
Police Office (Europol). Like foreign and defence affairs, justice
and home affairs are sensitive matters of state sovereignty. They
involve the use of coercion, the restriction of liberties, and
the conditions of public and social order. The execution of Title
VI provisions hence is a particularly difficult task. The desired
harmonisation of different penal laws will be a slow and painstaking
task. In spite of this, the opinion of the experts is that results
have already been achieved in the first two years of existence
of the Third Pillar (Willy Bruggeman, 1996).
<P>
Article K.l.9. of the Maastricht Treaty provides for the establishment
of Europol. In June 1991 Germany put a formal proposal to the
delegates negotiating on the reform of the treaties. The proposal
was to establish a unit for combating terrorism and organised
crime through the exchange of information and also with an operational
mandate.<BR>

<P>
Europol is &quot;to improve the effectiveness and co-operation
of the competent authorities in the Member States in preventing
and combating terrorism, unlawful drug trafficking and other serious
forms of international crime where there are factual indications
that an organised criminal structure is involved and two or more
Member Stares are affected... &quot; (article K.1.). 
<P>
The supplementary Declaration appended to the Treaty also refers
to other instruments like support, analysis of national prevention
programmes, training and research and development. Finally, the
Europol Convention (signed in Brussels on July 26th) describes
Europol's tasks as: exchange of information; analysis; facilitating
the co-ordination of ongoing investigations; increasing expertise;
training.<BR>

<P>
Europol's tasks will be performed by Europol officials and analysts
on the one hand and by liaison officers from the Member States
on the other. Every country is obliged to set up a national intelligence
service (Europol National Unit).
<P>
However, Europol is not a completely new agency. On June 2, 1993,
a Ministerial Agreement set up the Europol Drugs Unit (EDU), which
started operation on January 1st, 1994. Its mandate has been extended
by the Joint Action of the Justice and Interior Ministers of March
10, 1995 from drugs-related crime only to illicit trafficking
in radioactive and nuclear substances, illicit vehicle trafficking,
clandestine immigration networks and all associated money-laundering
activities. EDU does not take charge of cases but provides assistance
and support. Each team of liaison officers remains under the exclusive
control of the national authorities and the management of EDU
co-ordinates the team, not the cases. According to Bruggeman (1996),
this provisional model will probably be one of the cornerstones
of Europol: &quot;nothing else is possible given that the Member
States' criminal justice and law enforcernent systems are based
entirely on the principle of sovereignty&quot;.<BR>

<H1>EU and US transatlantic partnership and internal security
<BR>
</H1>

<P>
Since the end of World War II, relations between Western Europe
and the United States have been the object of continuous debate
among politicians, diplomats, academics and concerned people.
The conflict of interests and the similarity/identity of the fundamental
values of the two parts have been repeatedly assessed during the
last fifty years. 
<P>
The importance, for the whole international system, of co-operative
relations between the two sides of the Atlantic and the aknowledged
reason for differentiation and even for conflict on certain issues
have always encouraged concern for studying the alliance and devising
a stable and enduring framework to overcome recurrent tensions.
Academics defined the nature of the relation using concepts like
hegemony and asymmetrical interdependence. Politicians, instead,
preferred to soften asperities by not sparing in the use of words
like partnership and friendship. Contrary to past attention and
concern and in spite of the convulsive state of change of the
present international system, debate is mostly &quot;soft&quot;
today. A larger opportunity for change goes with less debate on
steering the change of Atlantic co-operation. It is as if academics
and politicians feel themselves inadequately informed as to how
to interpret the evolution of affairs, and, above all, uncertain
on how to take good decisions to update and/or upgrade Atlantic
co-operation. But, not every thing is immobile.<BR>

<P>
In November 1990, in Paris the United States and the European
Community signed the Transatlantic Declaration and opened a new
set of diplomatic negotiations. The Declaration was not consonant
with the traditional nature of US-Europe relations, either in
terms of the nature of the signatory parts or of the content of
the document. One of two signatories was the government of the
United States but the other one was an uncommon diplomatic actor,
the tandem composed of the EC Presidency and the President of
the Commission. As for the content of the Declaration, it was
concerned with low political matters as much as with high and
sensitive issues, like trade and GATT. However, the public's attention
(even that of concerned people) rapidly fell off. The same lack
of public attention marked the annual summits of the signatory
which followed the Paris summit. Two years ago, one of the few
researchers attentive to the Declaration and the following transatlantic
negotiatons made this remark: &quot;politicians and academics
alike have apparently forgotten the so-called Transatlantic Declaration,
the major attempt to redefine the common relations and to build
up something like a stable network of relations&quot; (Wessels,
1993).<BR>

<P>
The reason for the constitution of the transatlantic network can
be found in the need to prevent the blossoming of reciprocal worries.
On the American side, the worry is that once EU governments reach
a common position, this is declared as final and not open to negotiation
with the United States. On the European side, the worry is that
the United States wants to it at the EU negotiation table and
dominate the debate. Indeed, in a situation of no conflict among
EU governements, these may confront the US government with a non-
negotiable position; in a situation of conflict among EU governments,
instead, the US government may easily interfere by its direct
relations with the single European governments. 
<P>
Therefore, the transatlantic network of negotiations may be the
way to avoid such a double negative situation and make more equal
- perhaps, in the future also deeper - links between EU and the
United States.<BR>

<P>
The annual transatlantic summits between the Presidents of the
European Council and Commission and the President of the United
States have been considered as a major step to establish a <I>communaut&eacute;
de vue</I> as a base for common activities. At the same time,
the frequent meetings of working groups have been considered valuable
instruments of &quot;confidence building&quot; among administrations
not used to work toghether. 
<P>
But, critics say, the annual meetings are too infrequent to create
the projected <I>communaut&eacute; de vue</I> and the working
groups are inconclusive experiences for administrators used to
work with very different practices and styles. As a matter of
fact, the US side has to get accustomed to EU practices, like,
for instance the rotation of the Presidency. EU diplomats, in
their turn, have to work hard to get at effective co-ordination
of national positions and, when this is impossibile, to reduce
the effect of failed co-ordination in order to appropriately confront
their American counterpart.<BR>

<P>
In spite of complaints, the transatlantic network has not been
dismantled. On the contrary, by agreeing on the New Transatlantic
Agenda (signed in Madrid on December 15-16, 1995), the two parts
considered the present structure of co-operation as fitting well
to the state of EU-US relations. The Agenda presents four major
goals of co-operation (promoting peace, stability, democracy and
development around the world; responding to global challenges;
contributing to the expansion of world trade and closer economic
relations; building bridges across the Atlantic) and issues a
Joint EU/US Action Plan. It is difficult to say whether the Agenda
is a real incremental step, a simple updated version or a mere
repetition of the 1990 Declaration. Undoubtedly, the implementation
of the Action Plan will be the litmus test of the importance of
the Agenda and viability of the transatlantic network. The actions
to be taken are not easy, but the seriousness of the issues linked
to the first and second world change is certainly a strong incentive
to move in the direction devised in the Agenda.<BR>

<P>
Co-operation in the field of internal security is a major topic
of the Action Plan. It extensively defines the problem of international
crime prevention and containment, differentiates many aspects
of crime at the global level, and openly considers the case for
police co-operation.<BR>

<P>
The new dimensions of security - explicitly reported as products
of the globalisation process - are the very object of the Joint
EU/US Action Plan. The concluding part of the Agenda merits full
quotation. Governments confess their <TT>concern to address in
an effective manner new global challenges which, without respect
for national boundaries, present a serious threat to the quality
of life and which no one state can overcome alone. They list the
following global issues: international crime, terrorism and drug
trafficking, mass migration, degradation of the environment, nuclear
safety and disease. <BR>
</TT>
<P>
<TT>A series of bilateral co-operation and institutional contacts
are envisaged to fight against illegal drug trafficking, money
laundering, terrorism, organised crime and illicit trade in nuclear
materials. They are the enhancement of the capabilities of criminal
justice and investigative systems, the promotion of the rule of
law through international training programmes at regional institutions,
the establishment of an information exchange mechanism on co-operation
between the U.S. and the EU and member states in the law enforcement
and criminal justice fields, the exchange of law enforcement and
criminal justice. The possibility of establishing interim co-operative
measures between competent U.S. authorities and the European Drugs
Unit, the execution of the measures contemplated in the convention
on EUROPOL to facilitate relations between EUROPOL and the U.S.
Government are proposed, as well as co-operation in the framework
of the UN Drug Control Programme. To counter drug production,
the establishment of co-operative links between EU institutions
such as the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction
and the Commission Interamericana para el Control del Abuso de
Drogas are also proposed. <BR>
</TT>
<P>
<TT>Illegal immigration, traffic in illegal immigrants and the
traffic in women are further areas of public security co-operation
signalled in the Action Plan. Legal and judicial international
co-operation is also pledged as the dena for future common action.
<BR>
</TT>
<H1>The Barcelona Declaration and the Mediterranean theatre of
internal security<BR>
</H1>

<P>
At the very time the two world changes matured and the Atlantic
countries started the transatlantic network, the EU and its member
governments began to reconsider the state of another sector of
their international relations. The political and economic instability
of East European countries after the dissolution of communism
was not more serious than the condition of the neghbouring countries
in the Mediterranean region. It took some years to pass from the
awareness of the problem to the formulation of a policy, from
realising the unproductiveness of past programmes and actions
towards the Mediterranean countries, to putting on the ground
a new strategy aimed at substituting the traditional sectorial
and bilateral approach with the Euro-Meditarrean Partnership (See:
Joffe 1994; Pace 1995). The Barcelona conference - where the Partnership
has been solemnly launched - may be the opening of a new chapter
in the history of relations between the European Union and the
countries of the Mediterranean.<BR>

<P>
The United States has not been admitted as a full participant
state but assisted to the official parts of the conference. The
European Union and its member governments, with different positions,
excluded them for formal reasons. The United States is not a Mediterranean
country. However, invitation has been discussed and the exclusion
may be taken as an indication of the persistence of the &quot;dissociation
syndrome&quot;.
<P>
To take the United States as much as possible out of the restructuring
of the Mediterranean region while the restructuring of international
politics is in progress, was a delicatetask. However, the European
Union and its governments talked with the rest of the Mediterranean
governments on important political, security and economic matters
without the presence of the Washington government and made future
plans in all those matters.<BR>

<P>
The Declaration targets a free trade area among the 27 participants
by the year 2010 and pledges to start co-operation in a broad
range of political, social and economic fields. It comprises four
chapters (Political and Security Partnership; Economic and Financial
Partnership; Partnership in Social, Cultural and Human Affairs;
Follow-Up) and a work programme.<BR>

<P>
In the chapter on Political and Security Partnership the participants
stress their conviction that peace, stability and security in
the Mediterranean region are common assets which they pledge to
promote and strengthen &quot;by all means at their disposal&quot;.
It is in this chapter that they undertake to, among other things,
<BR>

<UL>
<LI>strengthen their co-operation in preventing and combating
terrorism, in particular by ratifying and applying the international
instruments they have signed, by acceding to such instruments
and by taking any other appropriate measure; 
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>fight together against the expansion and diversification of
organised crime and combat the drugs problem in all its aspects.

</UL>

<P>
In the chapter on Economic and Financial Partnership, the participating
countries fixed three long term objectives to their partnership:
to speed up the pace of lasting social and economic development;
to improve living conditions by increasing employment and closing
the development gap in the Euro-Mediterranean region; to promote
co-operation and regional integration.<BR>

<P>
In the chapter on Partnership in Social, Cultural and Human Affairs,
governments recognise that mutual understanding can be greatly
enhanced by human exchanges and dialogue between cultures. 
<P>
The conference agreed to establish a wide range of co-operation
between peoples, not only in politics but also in culture, religion,
education, the media, as well as between trade unions and public
and private companies. The Declaration also recognises the challenges
posed by current population trends in the Med12 (non-EU countries)
and says that they must be counterbalanced by &quot;appropriate
policies to accelerate economic take-off&quot;. Participants agreed
to strengthen their co-operation to reduce migratory pressures
and illegal immigration. They also acknowledged the principle
that source countries had &quot;a responsibility for readmission&quot;
of illegal immigrants to Europe. In this chapter again they pledge
to act against crime:<BR>

<UL>
<LI>they agree to strengthen co-operation by means of various
measures to prevent terrorism and fight it more effectively together;

</UL>

<UL>
<LI>by the same token they consider it necessary to fight jointly
and effectively against drug trafficking, international crime
and corruption. 
</UL>

<P>
Like the Helsinki Conference, the Barcelona Conference provides
for Follow-Up. Foreign Ministers from the 27 nations will meet
periodically to review progress in implementing the Declaration
and to agree on actions which will achieve its objectives. Their
first meeting will be in the first half of 1997 in a Mediterranean
member state of the Union. Sectorial meetings at ministerial level
will be organised together with <I>ad hoc</I> conferences.<BR>

<P>
To translate the Barcelona Declaration into concrete action, the
Conference approved a Work ProgrammeThis Programme encourages
initiatives to discuss migratory flows and co-operation between
law and order authorities as part of the fight against terrorism,
drug trafficking, organised crime and illegal immigration.<BR>

<H1>Conclusion<BR>
</H1>

<P>
The European Union is at the cross-roads of the Transatlantic
and the Mediterranean co-operation and is, at the same time, attempting
to formulate its own joint actions and common policies. The United
States is committed to reshaping its hegemonic foreign policy
but has to take into account contradictory trends: on the one
hand, the continuing need for the presence of an actor as the
provider of last resort of important collective goods of the system;
on the other hand, the challenges put to it by the aspirations
to greater autonomy of old and new actors of the global system.
The Med12 are both anxious to prevent the explosion of many crisis
factors in their societies and conscious, almost unanimously,
of the need for international co-operation to approach the condition
of take off. <BR>

<P>
In such a contingency, the fact that the objects of co-operation
in the European Union, Transatlatinc relations and the Euro-Meditarranean
region are the same, though not particularly astonishing to professional
observers of international politics, is a fact that merits attentive
consideration. The longer the governments go on with the implementation
of the Action Plan and Work Programme of such co-operation, the
stronger will be the change of the international system in the
direction of improving security in different dimensions.<BR>

<P>
Now that the Barcelona Conference has taken place and the final
declaration has been made, the South Mediterranean states that
were involved will have time to consider at leisure precisely
what it is that they have agreed to. Four of them - Turkey, Israel,
Tunisia and Morocco - already know the detailed terms of their
new economic relationship with Europe and at least two others
- Egypt and Algeria - are busy laying the groundwork for their
future links with the states of the European Union. Indeed, it
is the economic component of the future relationship which is
the most immediate and which is likely to have the most powerful
impact on the states concerned, for, in reality, the Barcelona
Conference was merely the framework for introducing Europe's new
Global Euro-Mediterranean Partnership policy which is essentially
economic in nature. The crucial question that they will have to
answer is whether the policy to which they have adhered will produce
genuine partnership or simply prolong economic dependence.<BR>

<P>
<B>The past<BR>
</B>
<P>
It is a truism to point out that the states of the southern Mediterranean,
except for Turkey, were all subject to colonial occupation and
that this had powerful effects on their economic development.
The effects are most strikingly seen in the Maghrib, where the
region's integration into the French colonial sphere meant that
economic structures were increasingly dedicated to serving the
metropolitan market. At the same time, these colonial economies
were divided into traditional subsistence sectors and modern,
capital-intensive sectors which were oriented towards the markets
of Europe, principally France. These changes caused profound modifications
in indigenous economic behaviour, such as the switch from hard
to soft wheat production in North Africa as Maghribi economies
became integrated into the European and American wheat markets,
or the destruction of handicraft industries in the wake of the
Great Depression and the growth of competing imports from Japan
in the 1930s. Even after Independence, this dependence of Mediterranean
economies on the European market continued, with the effect being
most profoundly marked in North Africa but extending into the
Mashriq as well.<BR>

<P>
The dependence was, to some extent, codified by the advent of
the Association and Co-operation Agreements with the European
Common Market after 1969. These agreements essentially sought
to provide for free entry into Europe of industrial goods and
minerals into Europe, as provided for in the Treaty of Rome, but
tried to regulate entry of agricultural goods by tariff barriers
designed to ensure that European and South Mediterranean produce
competed on equal terms inside the European market and thus did
not threaten the Common Agricultural Policy which was one of the
cornerstones of Franco-German co-operation. The European Commission
hoped that the agreements, which were bilateral in nature and
which were renewed in the mid-1970s and again in the mid-1980s,
would provide a breathing space in which the economies of the
South Mediterranean region would re-orient their export priorities
away from the European market and thus bring the delayed effects
of colonialism to an end.<BR>

<P>
In reality, of course, the reverse was true, for finding new markets
for agricultural produce of the kind that Mediterranean states
had to offer was difficult. Either their goods were not competitive,
given the transport costs - as was the case with citrus - or they
were unwanted because of local tastes and preferences. Despite
the tariff barriers, which removed their competitive advantage,
Europe did at least offer a secure market so that South Mediterranean
governments became increasingly concerned about creating fairer
terms of trade. The same was true of industrial goods where the
growing amount of textiles produced in the region had both to
compete with even cheaper produce from Asia and the Indian sub-continent
and faced discrimination because of the threat it offered to European
industry. They were excluded from the Staflex agreements that
applied outside the Mediterranean region but were required to
abide by a series of &quot;voluntary restraint agreements&quot;
instead. Once again, however, the lure of the European market
was irresistible because of its size and because it was so close.
<P>
The issue of agricultural trade became acute, however, in 1986,
when Spain and Portugal began a ten year economic transitional
regime as part of their entry into the European Common Market.
Europe was now more than self-sufficient in all the agricultural
produce that had originally come from North Africa and the Middle
East. This was particularly true of citrus, olive oil and early
vegetables. As a result, the agricultural import regime was modified
so that, by the end of the transitional regime, South Mediterranean
produce would be subjected to quota restrictions, rather than
tariff constraints. As far as North Africa was concerned, the
problem was that the quotas were based on average export levels
between 1980 and 1984 - which were years of drought! A special
arrangement had to be made to accommodate Tunisia's massive olive
oil production and separate arrangements covered Community fishing
in Moroccan waters - 740 out of 900 Spanish fishing boats from
Southern Spain depended on such access.<BR>

<P>
At the same time, there were growing anxieties in Europe over
the implications of demographic change in the South Mediterranean
region. Migration had long been a problem for certain European
states and the 4.3 million Muslim migrants within the 10 million
migrant workers in Europe came in their majority from the South
Mediterranean region, 2.6 million of them from the Maghreb alone.
The apparently constantly accelerating birth-rates in the region
only underlined the danger of migration if the countries concerned
did not succeed in maximising economic growth. Yet this appeared
to be an unlikely outcome for three decades of independence had
been marked by progressive economic failure and the growth of
foreign debt, particularly after 1973. As the European Commission
pointed out in 1993, &quot;It is difficult to avoid the conclusion
that the economy of the region is a failure.&quot; Although the
document in question referred to the Middle East, very similar
conclusions had been reached a year earlier in a similar analysis
of the Maghreb. <BR>

<P>
<B>The prescription<BR>
</B>
<P>
By the 1990s, the issue of official development assistance was
increasingly seen in Europe as an inappropriate means of reviving
economic growth and new weight was put on the process of attracting
foreign investment. In essence, the economic problems of the South
Mediterranean littoral states were seen as the consequence of
inappropriate resource allocation, caused by unrealistic pricing
policies . The Washington Consensus, accepted by the World Bank
and the IMF was seen as the appropriate remedy, with trade liberalisation
and the reduction of the state sector in the economy as the key.
The change in European policy towards the South Mediterranean
littoral that began to be considered at this time therefore bore
the hallmarks of neo-classical economics which were to achieve
pre-eminence in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union after
the Communist system collapsed in 1989-1991. At the same time,
the Commission also had to deal with growing unease in the southern
part of Europe that investment flows within the European Community
were increasingly flowing eastward, rather than towards the south.
The result has been the new Global Euro-Mediterranean Partnership
policy which was formally introduced in Barcelona in November
1995. In economic terms, the new policy seeks both to equilibrate
aid flows eastward and southwards and to stimulate indigenous
economic growth through economic restructuring and exposure to
free market competition. It also recognises that there is an essential
inter-dependence between the regions on each side of the Mediterranean
and that Europe cannot afford simply to ignore the very real problems
facing the South Mediterranean region.
<P>
In fact, Europe - essentially the fifteen states which now make
up the European Union - cannot simply ignore the region for reasons
connected with its own regional interests as well. It is heavily
dependent on the Middle East and North African region in terms
of energy supplies, for nearly 60 per cent of its needs in hydrocarbon
supplies come from there. In 1993, The Middle East supplied 32.6
per cent of Europe's requirements in oil (43.2 per cent of oil
imports), whilst North Africa supplied a further 14.6 per cent
(19.3 per cent of oil imports). In terms of natural gas, Algeria
and Libya alone supplied 19.4 per cent of European gas demand,
with a further 6 per cent to be supplied by the new Algeria-Spain
gas pipeline via Morocco which will be completed in June 1996,
bringing the total up to one quarter of Europe's natural gas import
needs. In this context, it is worth noting that, since it is the
Gulf region which is the major supplier of oil to Europe within
the overall region, it is difficult to consider Mediterranean
economic circumstances without including the Gulf as a part of
the Mediterranean region itself. Nonetheless, the problems that
face the littoral states are quite different from those of the
Gulf states and they will therefore be excluded from this discussion.
<BR>

<P>
At the same time, the importance of the Middle East and North
African region to Europe, from an economic point of view, should
not be over-stressed. In 1993 the region only supplied 8.1 per
cent of all Europe's imports and absorbed 7 per cent of Europe's
imports. However, in terms of the region itself, Europe was by
far the most important trade partner it possessed, as Table (1)
demonstrates. In 1992, for example, the twelve-member European
Union supplied 47.1 per cent of the region's import requirements
and absorbed 38.3 per cent of its exports. No other region of
the world even approaches these proportions, a consideration which
underlines the essentially asymmetrical trading relationship between
the Middle East and Europe. It is a relationship which, furthermore,
reflects historical as well as modern economic links and cannot,
for both these reasons, be ignored.<BR>

<B>The critique<BR>
</B>
<P>
The South Mediterranean region is thus highly dependent on its
relationship with Europe and this dependency has tended to increase,
not weaken, over recent years. Littoral states, in particular,
are acutely aware of the real nature of the relationship, as the
primacy given to their economic links with Europe indicates. Certain
European states, too - particularly those in Southern Europe -
are also very concerned by these factors as well. Overall, however,
European concern is conditioned by two factors; firstly dependence
on the region and its hinterland for oil and gas supplies and
secondly over the implications of economic decline within the
South Mediterranean and Middle Eastern region. This, in turn,
is closely connected with demographic growth patterns in the South
Mediterranean region, for these demonstrate that past and future
economic failure is linked to the demands on resources made by
expanding populations and that, unless these are met, Europe faces
the danger of uncontrolled and expanding immigration.<BR>

National economies in the South Mediterranean will have to grow
at a rate of at least 6 per cent per annum in real terms simply
to contain these massive populations, which are admittedly now
growing more slowly than suggested by the figures above. However,
even at projected growth rates of between 2.0 and 2.8 per cent
per year, they will still almost double by the year 2050, as shown
in Table (3), . Any lower rate of economic growth will not permit
governments to provide essential education, health and housing
services, nor to create sufficient employment to absorb a predominantly
young population. Even now, unemployment rates are between 10
and 30 per cent throughout the region and under-employment rates
can range as high as 50 per cent of the labour force. <BR>

The problem is that the current approved development model being
proposed to these states, in line with the &quot;Washington Consensus&quot;,
does little to deal with these social demands created by demography.
It may well improve macro-economic performance but it does virtually
nothing for micro-economic considerations which are the very factors
that influence social and political unrest. Certain sectors of
the reconstructed economy may well experience export-led growth,
but these sectors and their success have little effect on the
distribution of national wealth for the &quot;trickle-down&quot;
effect takes a long time to percolate outside such sectors - if,
indeed, it ever does do so.<BR>

<P>
The result is that the economies in question either remain stagnant
or see living standards progressively worsen. In addition, unless
there are significant competitive advantages, foreign investment
is not attracted and the export-led growth will tend to be either
in traditional exports - raw materials or agricultural goods -
or in low valued-added manufactures which tend to feed into the
production processes in metropolitan markets.<BR>

<P>
In any case, as far as the South Mediterranean states are concerned,
what export earnings are achieved have tended, in the past, to
be absorbed into debt repayment. Only Israel, because of its special
relationship with the United States, which is its major creditor,
and Tunisia have escaped this problem, whilst Libya falls outside
the discussion because of its status as a centrally-controlled
oil producer which depends virtually entirely on its oil rent
to pay for essential imports. 
<P>
This consideration has been particularly important for countries
such as Algeria and Morocco, where debt service ratios have been
very high and, without debt rescheduling operations, essential
import requirements could not have been satisfied. 
<P>
In essence, however, the cost of servicing foreign debt, plays
a critical role in delaying, if not annulling, the supposed benefits
of economic restructuring.<BR>

<P>
<B>Exogenous causes of failure<BR>
</B>
<P>
There is, however, a further, more basic problem with the &quot;Washington
Consensus&quot;. This is that it takes no account of the exogenous
influences on the economy, seeing its problems as being purely
endogamous in nature, even though it relies on exogenous factors
to correct them. Inevitably, such economic restructuring causes
considerable social disruption and, on occasion, impoverishment.
The external environment is often hostile towards national economic
development and, since it is the environment in which national
exports must compete, it can nullify the supposedly beneficial
effects of the proposed reforms which are designed to improve
international competitivity. In addition, compression of foreign
exchange earnings not only hinders debt repayment but also causes
compression of vital imports. The consequence is that the restructuring
process can be significantly lengthened as a result of such external
factors and the social disruption caused is thereby intensified.
Indeed, the goal of the restructuring process may become virtually
unattainable for these reasons.<BR>

<P>
A good example of this process is provided by the Algerian experience
of the mid-1980s. This was a time when the Algerian regime was
attempting to introduce state-directed and gradual economic liberalisation.
The sudden Saudi-induced drop in world oil prices in 1986 came,
therefore, at a critical juncture. The sudden worsening of its
foreign exchange position - the decline in nominal oil prices
combined with a simultaneous depreciation of the dollar, the currency
in which oil prices are denominated, produced a 20 per cent decline
in foreign currency receipts in an economy which was a high capital
absorber - seriously affected import supply and the debt service
ratio which, by 1992 had climbed to a terrifying 72 per cent.
Of course, the resultant crisis was also of the regime's own making;
it did not seek rescheduling fast enough and refused to accept
the need for significant and specific economic restructuring.
Nonetheless, the external environment did nothing to ease its
predicament and played a significant role in creating the conditions
for the October 1988 riots. A similar pattern of social unrest
leading to widescale rioting has marked the economic restructuring
programmes of Tunisia (January 1984), Morocco (June 1981, January
1984 and December 1990), Egypt (1976 and 1986) and Jordan (1990).
<BR>

<P>
Indeed, all South Mediterranean states except Algeria and Libya
run significant trade deficits and thus depend on other sources
to provide the financial flows essential to make up the balance
of payments. Of these the most important is workers' remittances
and, despite its growing unpopularity with donor countries, official
development assistance still plays a role. Direct private foreign
investment, although it has grown in importance in Morocco and
Tunisia, has declined markedly in Egypt, from $1.25 billion in
1989 to an estimated $530 million in 1994. Yet, even in Morocco
and Tunisia, levels of private foreign investment are static at
around $500-$550 million for the former and $270-$300 million
for the latter. Portfolio investment has not, so far, played a
significant role at all, although the current privatisation programmes
in many South Mediterranean countries may alter this, particularly
when privatisation operations occur through local stock exchanges.

Yet, quite apart from the lack of internally-sustained patterns
of development based on investment, there are other objective
factors which hamper economic development in the region as well,
and which relate directly to European attitudes towards the South
Mediterranean region. Not least is the growing inaccessibility
of Western European labour markets to the South Mediterranean
region, so that excess labour there can neither be soaked up nor
generate further remittance flows, as in the past. There is also
the growing problem for agricultural exporters created by the
barriers within Europe to their produce - most recently underlined
by the particularly mean-minded dispute over cut-flower and tomato
exports to Europe from Morocco in october 1995. In part, of course,
this reflects the fact that Europe is now virtually self-sufficient
in all aspects of agricultural production and is no longer prepared
to honour export patterns established in colonial times, particularly
as far as early vegetables, olive oil and citrus are concerned.
As mentioned above, this is translated into quota and tariff restrictions
under the Common Agricultural Policy which particularly affect
Israel, Morocco, Tunisia and Egypt. Israel is less severely affected,
as it has already begun to cut back on agricultural exports for
reasons of restricted water access. 
<P>
The import restrictions have acquired a new importance since the
start of 1996 for Spanish and Portuguese integration into the
European Market is now complete and the new quota arrangements
come into force to replace the old reference price system of tariff
barriers to South Mediterranean agricultural exports.<BR>

<P>
Ironically enough, the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round
of the GATT, which was signed in Marrakesh in 1994, also has negative
connotations for the South Mediterranean region. Although world
trade was expected to rise by some $512 billion (some estimates
spoke of $572 billion), sub-Saharan Africa and North Africa were
expected to be net losers - with North Africa losing up to $600
million annually. The Middle East would gain by $1.2 million annually
- although virtually all of this would accrue to the Gulf oil
producers. One of the main reasons for the losses involved cereal
imports which, under the reduced GATT tariff levels (with Europe
removing 30 per cent of its subsidies) would undercut local prices
which were supported. These imports are not insignificant: in
the 1984-86 period, for example, Morocco produced an average of
5 million tons each year and imported 2.2 million tons; Algeria
produced 2.9 million tons and imported 3.9 million tons; and Tunisia,
which produced 1.2 million tons annually, imported a similar amount.
Little has happened since then to alter the basic situation. Overall,
the region imports 50 per cent of its cereal requirements and
is extremely sensitive to external prices. This translates into
a wider sensitivity to falling tariffs in the wider world and
the World Bank has calculated that South Mediterranean trade with
Europe will be severely affected by the GATT regulations, falling
by $5.5 billion annually - unless the region is integrated into
Europe.<BR>

<P>
<B>Endogamous factors<BR>
</B>
<P>
At the same time, there is little doubt that most of the South
Mediterranean economies need economic reform: their chronic budget,
trade and current account deficits make this clear, as does their
dismal growth record over the years. Public sector involvement
in their economies has traditionally been high - 70 per cent in
Algeria, 40 per cent in Tunisia, Morocco and Egypt up to the 1980s,
for example, which often contributed significantly to their heavy
budget deficits. Failure to achieve adequate export levels has
meant that, except for the Libyan oil economy, foreign trade balances
have usually been negative and this has contributed to indebtedness,
as foreign exchange to pay for imports has been lacking. It is
for this reason that workers remittances and tourist revenues
have been essential in reducing current account deficits, with
capital inflows being the only way in which the balance of payments
has usually been maintained for most of the non-oil exporting
economies. <BR>

One consequence of such deficits, particularly in the external
account, has been to reduce public sector investment, with concomitant
reductions in economic development rates. This has been particularly
serious in terms of the development of human resources. The persisting
problems of adult illiteracy, despite decades of heavy investment
in education, indicates the level of the failure they have experienced
in exploiting their human resources - which ultimately determine
any sustained development process, as the experience of South-East
Asia makes clear. There improving levels of education went hand-in-hand
with low labour costs and government strategic involvement in
achieving and maintaining development. In the South Mediterranean
region, however, even if the necessary employment could be created,
there are not the necessary skilled workers to satisfy demand.
In any case, many of the more enterprising elements of the workforce
migrate to Europe or to the Gulf.<BR>

<P>
Quite apart from the issue of human resources, the majority of
South Mediterranean countries also suffer from inadequate physical
infrastructure. This, combined with ill-trained and nobody motivated
work-forces, seriously hinders access to direct private foreign
investment, which is now considered to be the crucial motor for
economic development, once satisfactory economic restructuring
has been achieved. 
<P>
Here, however, the South Mediterranean region has been a manifest
failure, as Table (7) demonstrates, coming just above South Asia
- the lowest ranking region in the developing world in terms of
access to direct private foreign investment. 
<P>
This is a staggering position, given the potential of the South
Mediterranean region and its closeness to a major world market.
It reflects, in part, the Western perception of chronic political
instability within the region and the inadequacy of infrastructural,
financial, human and legal resources to persuade investors that
investment prospects are good. It also reflects the anxieties
of indigenous investors over the region's potential. 
<P>
Around $465 billion-worth of Arab private investment is located
outside the Middle East-North Africa region, rather than within
it! It also highlights the levels of development that will be
needed if the region is ever to attract the investment it needs
to be able to realise the growth rates that are essential if the
demographic problems its faces are to be contained. 
<P>
However, as described above, this can only be done with the aid
of external assistance, a consideration that makes the economic
relations of the region with Europe of crucial importance, particularly
as official development assistance levels are static or declining
- in accordance with the &quot;Washington Consensus&quot; - for
it will be Europe that will be the only source of the essential
foreign investment for macro-economic recovery, whatever happens
at the micro-economic level.<BR>

<B>The Euro-Mediterranean Partnership<BR>
</B>
<P>
It is considerations such as these that make the conclusions of
the Barcelona Conference so important for the South Mediterranean
Region. The decision to offer industrial free trade area arrangements
on a bilateral basis to individual South Mediterranean states
as part of a new set of Association Agreements was the first step
in this process. The proposal to merge such agreements into a
multilateral southward extension of the European Economic Area
is the second. The third will be to renegotiate both the restrictions
on agricultural trade, to free it from the limitations of the
Common Agricultural Policy and bring it into the free trade ambit
- which the European Commission has agreed to consider - and to
reconsider the restrictions on the free movement of people, to
parallel that of goods and services. This is most unlikely in
the near future, despite the fact that the European labour force
is ageing and will not accept unskilled and semi-skilled work.
<BR>

<P>
The explicit objective of these new proposals - and the new types
of bilateral agreements have already been signed by Tunisia, Israel
and Morocco, with Turkey obtaining its own customs union agreement
and Egypt and Algeria seeking to imitate their Maghribi partners
- is to provide a basis for accelerated economic growth, so that
increased migration will not be necessary. There is also the belief
that economic improvement will reduce domestic political instability
and thus increase access to direct private foreign investment
and to portfolio investment - which is now just beginning. It
has to be said, however, that the basic structural problems still
remain and the costs of integration may prove to be very high
indeed.<BR>

<P>
Despite the new institutional arrangements, there is still little
to encourage the private foreign investor. Physical, institutional
and human resource infrastructure is still weak and will take
many years to change. Current policies of reducing public sector
involvement in the economy will in any case slow down change,
particularly if the private sector is not prepared to pick up
the gauntlet. In addition, the costs of coping with adjustment
to the new free trade areas is likely to be severe, despite the
twelve year transition periods proposed (most South Mediterranean
countries would have sought a fifteen year transition period,
but the Commission is not prepared to tolerate this). Tunisia
has estimated that 2,000 companies will disappear and 2,000 other
may be similarly threatened, whilst a further 2,000 companies
will face difficulties. It is seeking $2.2 billion for the costs
of transition designed to avoid the kind of industrial crisis
it anticipates, up to 80 per cent of which will have to come from
foreign sources. Morocco anticipates that, without significant
help, up to 60 per cent of its industrial base could be destroyed
by European competition and that up to Dh45 billion ($5.6 billion)
will be required to cover the costs of the transition.
<P>
Of course, the situation will never be as bad as portrayed. It
is, however, clear that significant increases in foreign aid will
be necessary to achieve the structural adjustment necessary if
the new free trade area policy is to produce the desired result.
In this connection, the doubling of European Union aid in the
next Five Year Financial Protocol to Ecu4.67 billion, with a similar
amount being made available in the form of soft aid and concessionary
loans, does not seem to be very generous, since it represents
only Ecu2 billion annually for the whole of the South Mediterranean
region. It is difficult to avoid the conclusion, however, that
without significant amounts of additional official development
assistance, given the relative failure of direct private foreign
investment, the damage done in the medium term to the economies
of the South Mediterranean region may well outweigh the longer
term benefits, if any do accrue.<BR>

<P>
<B>Conclusion<BR>
</B>
<P>
The net result of the new proposals, in short, may not resolve
the developmental crisis facing the South Mediterranean region.
The Maghrib and the Mashriq, however, have no real alternative.
Without sufficient assistance to undertake and complete the essential
infrastructural tasks they face - and this must be provided from
outside the region, either from private or public sources - they
cannot anticipate the economic growth rates needed to deal with
their demographic crisis and achieved sustained development. In
addition, without appropriate protection during the transition
periods, it is likely that export patterns will never be transformed
into high valued-added goods of the kind that would allow South
Mediterranean economies to compete on more equal terms with Europe.
Furthermore, the continued exclusion of South Mediterranean migrants
from the European labour market, despite the anticipated shortfall
in indigenous labour supply by the third decade of the next century,
is bound to damage the creation of economic symmetry across the
Mediterranean basin. Instead, the Tunisian and Maltese experience
of off-shore production for European industry, based on differential
wage rate advantages, may become the norm and thus institutionalise
regional economic asymmetry within the European geo-economic zone.

<P>
The alternative to genuine economic partnership may well therefore
be that the states of the Southern Mediterranean littoral simply
become satellite economies of Europe, so that balanced, self-sustained
growth there will become no more than a distant, unattainable
dream.

<P>
First of all, allow me to say a few words about the Council of
Europe. It is the oldest European institution, created in 1949
with the aim to &quot;achieve a greater unity between its Members
for the purpose of safeguarding and realising the ideals and principles
which are their common heritage and facilitating their economic
and social progress&quot; (art. 1a of the Statute of the Council
of Europe).<BR>

<P>
To become a member of the Council a country must accept the principles
of the rule of law and the protection of human rights and meet
the requirements of genuine pluralistic parliamentary democracy.
Within the Council of Europe the respect of the rights of minorities
has also become an important aspect of human rights protection.
<BR>

<P>
Since the accession of Russia on 28 February 1996, our Organisation
counts 39 member States. It is expected that in the coming years
the Council will group all the European countries, thus becoming
a truly pan-European organisation. Moreover, in December 1995
the United States obtained observer status with the Council of
Europe, and Canada and Japan have applied for similar status.
<BR>

<P>
Co-operation in the Mediterranean has been a long-standing feature
of the Council of Europe's activities. However, this co-operation
has until now benefited mainly the Mediterranean member States.
We would have to go a long time back in history to trace the beginning
of our activities on behalf of the Mediterranean countries. Let
me cite, as an example, the creation in 1962 - on the initiative
of the Council of Europe and the OECD - of the International Centre
for Advanced Mediterranean Agronomic Studies, the main purpose
of which is to provide complementary training of technical and
scientific staff in agriculture and development.<BR>

<P>
As far as the Parliamentary Assembly is concerned, it has focused
much attention on environmental issues, proposing several actions
designed to combat the deteriorating environmental situation.
This has led, among other things to the 1975 Treaty of Barcelona
on the protection of the Mediterranean sea, a UN initiative signed
by almost all Mediterranean member States of the Council of Europe,
to an information campaign of the &quot;Centre for documentation
and information on the Environment and Nature&quot; between 1988
and 1991, and to the launching in 1991 of the &quot;Blue Europe&quot;
programme on the elaboration of a pan-European policy on the management
of water resources. <BR>

<P>
The Parliamentary Assembly has organised four major Mediterranean
conferences in Co-operation with the Congress of Local and Regional
Authorities of Europe. The first such Conference was held in Marseille
in 1985 and adopted the Declaration of Marseille, focusing on
the elaboration of several proposals for the resolution of the
environmental problems and the institutionalisation of the dialogue
between the two shores of the Mediterranean. The second, held
in Malaga in 1987, led to a final declaration covering the questions
of tourism, transport and communication in the Mediterranean basin,
and the means to reinforcing interregional co-operation. In 1993
the third Conference of Mediterranean regions was held in Taormina
and the main subjects dealt with were the promotion of dialogue
between the two Mediterranean shores, co-operation in the field
of democracy and human rights in order to guarantee the &quot;Democratic
security in the Mediterranean&quot;, as well as in the field of
environment and immigration. Finally, the fourth Conference was
held in Cyprus in 1995 and focused on the &quot;sustainable development
in the Mediterranean Basin: environment, demography and migrations&quot;,
underlining for the member states of the Council of Europe, the
importance of including North-South co-operation in their Mediterranean
policy and, by means of regional and local authorities and NGOs,
promoting intercultural dialogue, tolerance and the integration
of immigrants in their societies. The fifth Conference is planned
to be held in Languedoc-Roussillon, in 1997.<BR>

<P>
A Parliamentary hearing on co-operation in the Mediterranean is
scheduled to be held in Thessaloniki on 27 May 1996.<BR>

<P>
On the Intergovernmental side, the Council of Europe and the Greek
Ministry of Regional Planning are organising a Seminar in Athens
on 25 and 27 April 1996 on the subject of &quot;The Challenges
facing European Society with the Approach of the Year 2000: Strategies
for the sustainable development of European States in the Mediterranean
Basin&quot; in preparation for the Conference of European ministers
responsible for regional planning, to be held in Cyprus in 1997.
<BR>

<P>
The Council of Europe has also paid much attention to political,
economic and immigration issues in the Mediterranean. <BR>

<P>
One major point of concern has been the conflict over Cyprus.
Whereas a solution to this problem must be found under the a egis
of the Secretary General of the United Nations, the Council of
Europe has closely followed the situation, devoted much energy
and time to efforts of reconciliation and to making constructive
proposals for a solution [cf. Recommendation 1259 (1995) and Resolution
1054 (1995) of Parliamentary Assembly on the situation in Cyprus
-recent political developments]. The Assembly's Rapporteur, Lord
Finsberg, very recently visited Cyprus in preparation of new proposals,
in support of the UN's Secretary General's proposals on a bi-communal
structure, to be presented to the Parliamentary Assembly in June
1996.<BR>

<P>
The second major problem is the instability in the Middle-East
over the Palestinian question. The Assembly has made great efforts
to promote the peace process through visits and goodwill missions
and by fostering contacts between the Israelis and the Palestinians.
This led in 1993 to the adoption of the Recommendation 1221 and
the Resolution 1013 on the Peace Process in the Middle-East.<BR>

<P>
As a result of this initiative, both Mr Yitzhak Rabin and Mr Yasser
Arafat addressed our Assembly on 26 January and 13 April 1994
respectively. More recently, the Assembly has set up five Task
Forces on economic reconstruction and development, youth and education,
local democracy, democratic institution-building, and human rights,
the judiciary and the penitentiary in the Middle -East in order
to prepare a major assembly debate on the peace process next June.
In the meantime, three Task Forces have held their first meetings
with the participation of Israeli, Palestinian and European delegations.
<BR>

<P>
The third major challenge to Europe consists in creating better
co-operation with the countries of the Southern Mediterranean.
In this connection I would like to draw your attention to the
Assembly's work in favour of a better intercultural and interreligious
understanding, which led to the adoption of Resolution 885 (1991)
and 1202 (1993). 
<P>
In Vienna, at the summit meeting of Heads of State and Governments
of the Council of Europe member States, it was declared that &quot;the
deepening of Co-operation in order to take account of the new
European situation should in no way divert us from our responsibilities
regarding North-South interdependence and stability&quot;. In
this spirit, Europe has a responsibility towards the countries
of the Southern littoral, which are not eligible to join the Council
of Europe or the European Union. The Committee of Ministers is
fully aware both that the future of these nearby countries has
a vital bearing on Europe's democratic security and stability
and that it is essential to promote their political, economic,
social and cultural development, in order to contribute to a greater
respect for human rights. For these reasons, the Committee of
Ministers decided, among other things, to set up a working party
of Ambassadors in order to follow up the Parliamentary Assembly's
Recommendation 1249 (1994) on &quot;Co-operation in the Mediterranean
basin&quot;. This group, which is chaired by Dr. Buttigieg Scicluna,
the Ambassador of Malta, has identified a number of areas where
the development of the Council of Europe's relations with the
Mediterranean countries seem potentially useful. The main areas
are: the establishment of democratic institutions, the promotion
of the rule of law and human rights, including minority rights
and equality between women and men, emigration, the fight against
drug-trafficking and drug-use, action against racism and intolerance,
as well as the environment and the common cultural heritage.<BR>

<P>
This contribution also identified a number of Council of Europe
conventions and partial agreements open to accession by non-member
countries and likely to be of interest for the purposes of Mediterranean
co-operation. These concern culture, the environment and wildlife,
and the legal field. Moreover it was proposed that Mediterranean
non-member States could benefit from the accession to two partial
agreements of the Council of Europe, that is to say the &quot;Open
Partial Agreement on the prevention of, protection against, and
organisation of relief in, major natural and technological disasters&quot;
and the one on &quot;the European Centre for Global Interdependence
and Solidarity&quot; or more poignantly referred to as &quot;the
North-South Centre&quot; of the Council of Europe.<BR>

<P>
This Centre could indeed become one of the focal points for Mediterranean
co-operation. For this purpose, the Centre has already set up
a Transmed Programme which includes a youth programme, co-operation
between the media, the setting up of an information system on
Internet for the Mediterranean called Medgate, confidence-building
measures in the Middle-East, cultural exchanges, and co-operation
with organisations of local and regional authorities. In fact,
the initiative for the Transmed activities was taken at the &quot;international
Symosium on Trans-Mediterranean Interdependence and Partnership&quot;,
organised by the North-South Centre in Rome in 1994.<BR>

<P>
For the future I can see three major lines of action. <BR>

<P>
Firstly, the Parliamentary Assembly will continue to play an essential
role in promoting co-operation and political dialogue in the Mediterranean
area. This concerns in particular the Eastern part of the Mediterranean
and the Middle-East. The Assembly will not accept the non-respect
by any member State of the fundamental principles and values of
the Council of Europe in respect of human rights, democracy and
the rule of law. It will also seek to foster a dialogue with the
non-member States on the Southern shore. In this respect, I refer
to the recent participation of the Speaker of the Egyptian Parliament
in the Assembly, when he underlined that: 
<P>
&quot;Europe as a shrine of democracy has on its shoulders double
responsibility, one is internal, and the other is external toward
its Southern neighbours&quot;.<BR>

<P>
Secondly, the Council of Europe could contribute to the implementation
of the Declaration adopted by the Euro-Mediterranean Conference
held in Barcelona in November 1995, in specific fields of its
competence such as culture, education, human rights, immigration,
and the fight against intolerance, xenophobia and racism.<BR>

<P>
Thirdly, increased co-operation among the Mediterranean countries
could be fostered by the North-South Centre.<BR>

<P>
However such existing or new forms of co-operation are contingent
on the political will on all sides, and on whether or not stability
and peace can be maintained in the more troubled parts of the
Mediterranean. <BR>

<P>
In all events, the Council of Europe's contribution will have
to be modest in financial terms, but may be very significant in
political terms. One cannot underestimate the vital role of the
Council of Europe in maintaining and strengthening human rights,
democracy and the rule of law in its member States and its effects
on the Council's immediate neighbours. The need for improved forms
of Europe-Mediterranean co-operation exist. The Council of Europe's
efforts can only act as a catalyst. They will have an effect only
if made in conjunction with the political will and development
efforts of all the Mediterranean partners.

<P>
<B>I. Introduction<BR>
</B>
<P>
While populations around the shores of the Mediterranean are bound
together by shared historical experience, cultural exchanges and
trade, there are still some striking differences at an economic
level. On the northern shores Italy, France and Spain have a fundamental
role in setting the EU's Mediterranean agenda whilst smaller countries
like Portugal and Greece reflect the challenges and constraints
confronting peripheral but relatively developed regions in southern
Europe. On the southern shores of the Mediterranean, there are
countries which, confronting severe socio-economic problems, experience
the rise of fundamentalism.<BR>

<P>
However, even within the poorer regions of the Mediterranean region,
certain differences subsist. Attempts towards regionalism have
not been markedly successful (a case in point being the Union
of the Arab Maghreb (UMA)) largely due to divergent socio-economic
policies and lack of economic complementarity among the members
as well as political instability. Turkey and Egypt have a combined
population of over 100&nbsp;million, with population growth rising
at around 2.5 per cent per annum. Demographic problems are expected
to create further socio-economic pressures within the region.
On the other hand, Malta, Cyprus and Israel are countries which
have registered exceptional economic growth, compared to the rest
of the Mediterranean non-member countries (MNC) and also to the
northern Mediterranean EU members. <B>II. Priority economic areas
<BR>
</B>
<P>
The main economic areas for the co-operation in the Mediterranean
region in the aftermath of Barcelona (November 1995) may be summarised
s follows :<BR>

<OL>
<LI>Energy, Water, Telecommunications, Transport infrastructure
<LI>Household Food Security, Agriculture and Agro-Industry
<OL>
<LI>Industrial Development, with special reference to micro-enterprises
and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and technology creation
<LI>Trade and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and the Globalisation
Process 
</OL>

<LI>Environment
<LI>Tourism 
</OL>

<P>
The above list, which is not presented in order of priority, must
be considered in its socio-political context, with particular
reference to the observance of human rights and to the problem
of immigration from the southern to the northern shores. I shall
now comment on each problem area <BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>1. Energy, Telecommunications and Transport Infrastructure
<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
Investment in infrastructure, especially in water production and
management, in energy and in transport, is a pre-condition for
business investment and a contributor to economic growth, employment
creation and international competitiveness. A large proportion
of the Structural and Cohesion funds in Southern Europe has been
channeled into infrastructural projects. The European Investment
Bank (EIB) has been very active in strengthening the infrastructure
across the Mediterranean countries. Further public investment
is however required in sewage works, waste disposal, telecommunications,
water supplies and energy and road transport.
<P>
Better infrastructure, especially within the rural areas, plays
a crucial role in alleviating poverty. A strengthened road transport
network enables marketing of agricultural products and easy access
to health, education and other services, particularly within peripheral
areas in countries like Algeria, Egypt, and Turkey. There also
needs to be adequate maintenance of road systems, hence necessitating
investments in specialised human resources and equipment. Environmental
infrastructure should also be placed high on the policy agenda
in the Mediterranean region, including measures to achieve better
energy efficiency and promote clean alternative energy sources
(wind or solar).<BR>

<P>
The water crisis is endemic in most southern Mediterranean countries
and islands and is increasingly affecting northern Mediterranean
countries, including France, Spain, Italy and Greece. Demand is
increasing for agricultural, residential and industrial purposes
and thus one of the main challenges confronting all Mediterranean
countries is to design strategies for water reuse and production.
Further investments are required in sewage treatment and desalination
plants. Furthermore there should be sustained efforts towards
monitoring water supply. The need becomes imperative given the
effects of global warming and consequent climatic change.<BR>

<P>
Infrastructure still remains the domain of the public sector and
is expected to remain such in this region. The proposed Mediterranean
Corporation for Industrial Development (see section 3) should
identify other sources of funding to upgrade the infrastructure
in some Mediterranean countries.<BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>2. Household Food Security, Agriculture and Agro-Industry
<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
Agriculture and agro-industry constitute one of the most important
economic areas on both northern and southern shores of the Mediterranean.
Although its share in gross domestic product has fallen in most
countries over the past years, the sector remains one of the main
employers. In several southern Mediterranean countries, a food
subsidy system has been in place to protect household food security,
although budgetary constraints have tended to reduce the coverage
and cost of the subsided products. Malnutrition is not as severe
as in most Sub-Saharan countries but there are vulnerable groups,
especially babies, young children, young mothers and old persons,
who suffer from basic nutritional deficiencies.<BR>

<P>
The priorities in this field are the introduction of appropriate
marketing, pricing, tax and exchange rate policies; investment
in rural infrastructure, health and sanitation and education facilities.
Although these issues fall internationally within the mandate
of the World Bank International Monetary Fund and the Food and
Agriculture Organisation (FAO), yet their economic impact suggests
that there should be more policy-oriented agricultural research
in the region with continuous monitoring of the effects of the
structural adjustment process on household food security, including
the design of measures which need to be introduced at an early
stage to minimise any adverse effects that such a process could
generate.<BR>

<P>
The Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research
(CGIAR) plays an important role within the applied research context,
especially through IFPRI (International Food Policy Research Institute)
based in the United States and ICARDA (Syria). however, there
is scope for a more regionally-focused initiative concerning food
security and nutrition in the Mediterranean region. A Centre could
be set up under the general direction of the specialised research
institute ICAMAS (International Centre for Advanced Mediterranean
Agronomic Studies) based in Paris and with the support of the
EU and FAO, to compile a database which gathers information on
current food demand, forecasts and nutritional status at a micro
level through longitudinal studies using national food and nutrition
surveys. Such studies must be launched at a regional level. The
Centre would liaise with the different National Food and Nutrition
Centres, monitoring the health and diet status of the target populations
and offering recommendations to national and international organisations.
<BR>

<P>
Moreover, the future of agriculture and agro-industry in the southern
Mediterranean countries and of the workers dependent on this industry
lies in the expansion and diversification of trade, upgrading
of product quality, and increasing off-farm employment opportunities.
There is also the need for greater investment in food storage
facilities and new agricultural technologies, in particular drip-irrigation
techniques, and small and medium-scale irrigation schemes. In
the case of some countries/regions, there is the potential to
link agriculture and tourism activities or agriculture and craft
industries. 
<P>
There needs to be a clear commitment by all Governments within
the Mediterranean to liberalise regional trade, especially within
the agriculture and agro-industrial sector, and to support the
creation of new micro-enterprises or small industrial activities
which supply larger units (on a sub-contracting basis or through
the industrial districts concept, which has operated so efficiently
in some regions in Italy). Finally, agricultural co-operatives
at both production and marketing levels should also be supported.
<BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>3. Industrial Development, Small and Medium-Sized
Enterprises (SMEs) and Technology Creation<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
Industrial development in MNCs is rather unbalanced and of a dualistic
nature. The role of the state has also been traditionally extremely
predominant in the productive activities of the economy in most
southern Mediterranean countries. Thus the main challenges confronting
most countries is a diversification process, away from apredominance
of sectors based on cheap labour costs (textiles and wearing apparels)
and the exploitation of natural resources or agricultural raw
materials to the identification of new market niches and the promotion
of the quality concept in industry. Within this context, it is
important to set in place systems of standards, certification
bodies and testing and calibration laboratories. New export opportunities
depend on the ability to diversify the range of goods offered,
product differentiation and specialisation in high-quality products.
Another priority is to support micro-enterprises and SMEs in their
export marketing strategies through regional trade liberalisation,
stimulating and nurturing entrepreneurs.<BR>

<P>
There also needs to be a socio-economic context conducive to growth,
especially through the encouragement of market mechanisms and
through favouring social factors (education), and political stability
to foster technology creation, rather than traditional and conventional
technology transfer as such. 
<P>
The success of this new technology policy is largely dependent
on how adaptable local factors of production are to changing technological
requirements, the two fundamental pre-requisites being improved
manpower training and the strengthening of the basic infrastructure.
Two areas of potential development in the Mediterranean area are
irrigation schemes and marine industrial technology.<BR>

<P>
Marine technology is an area which indicates a tremendous technological
gap between the northern and southern shores of the Mediterranean.
In this context a Mediterranean Centre for Research and Development
in Marine Industrial Technology would not only reduce such a gap
but could also identify specific needs (for example, water production)
and develop, on the Eureka <I>partenariat </I>model, suitable
technology (for example, solar desalination) to fill those needs.
<BR>

<P>
It is also recommended that a Mediterranean Corporation for Industrial
Development be established, one that could be modelled on the
existing Centre for Industrial Development (CID) between ACP countries
and the EU under the Lom&eacute; Convention and will be mainly
concerned with SME development. The main difference between the
existing CID and the proposed Mediterranean entity is that it
would not only act as a support service but would also be a financial
institution on the same lines as the World Bank's affiliate -
the International Finance Corporation. Thus, the Corporation would
provide finance and investment expertise and raise funds from
international markets, tapping venture capital. A necessary pre-requisite,
of course, would be the development of efficient financial networks,
a strengthened legal and accounting system and the emergence of
a sense of entrepreneurism.<BR>

<P>
The role of the Corporation would encompass all existing programmes
- BC-Net, BRE, Med-Invest and European Community Investment Partners
(ECIP) - and further strengthen the support services component
to development agencies, chambers of commerce, federation of industries
and individual firms within MNCs. this would hence include the
evaluation of initial requests for project proposals, partner
search, feasibility studies, diagnostic studies about structural
changes within different industrial sectors, the design of industrial
strategies, training, export marketing, assistance in technology
creation and promoting deregulation and privatisation initiatives.
<BR>

<P>
These services will be targeted to SMEs and micro-enterprises
since, as the experience of industrialised countries has shown,
they have a vital role to play in resolving the problems of structural
unemployment and weak economic growth. Although micro-enterprises
normally engage less than 10 employees, they operate across various
activities, including agriculture, handicrafts, trading, services
and manufacturing. They are flexible and adaptable and operate
within that informal sector which, especially in the southern
and eastern Mediterranean, has enjoyed a long tradition.<BR>

<P>
The proposed Corporation could support these firms through subsidiaries
or new specialised institutions (modeled, for example, on the
Grameen Bank in Bangladesh) in the areas of easier access to credit
vocational training and training in financial and business management
techniques, which should particularly enable the activation of
agricultural investment in certain remote rural areas. Such forms
of economic activity create new employment opportunities, contribute
to improved, more equitable living standards through broader and
more even income distribution patterns, support women's activities
and strengthen horizontal and vertical linkages throughout the
economy thus engendering a more integrated and resilient economic
base for more balanced economic expansion. The role of non-Governmental
Organisations (NGOs) is also very important in this context. Furthermore
it is imperative to bear in mind that it is not solely the quantum
of the financial support which is relevant but its planning, management
and co-ordination between Government and private organisations
and NGOs.<BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>4. Trade, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and
the Regionalism-Globalisation Process<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
Future Euro-Mediterranean trade relations will culminate in a
free trade area by the year 2010 up new market opportunities to
southern Mediterranean countries. It is still premature to ascertain
the potential magnitude and direction of the trade creation and
trade diversion effects of the proposed Euro-Mediterranean Partnership
but further market liberalisation can be part of the solution
to the bleak economic situation of many MNCs. In 1992, the trade
balance with the EU was only positive for Algeria, Cyprus and
Syria whilst Israel, Turkey, Lebanon, Tunisia and Egypt each registered
a deficit exceeding 1 billion ecus. With further trade liberalisation,
both under the new Partnership and the World Trade Organisation,
the EU is expected to gradually dismantle several of its existing
trade barriers. It is expected that MNCs will benefit from new
opportunities, particularly on the FDI front.<BR>

<P>
The proposed Corporation would also provide a Foreign Investment
Advisory Service to assist governments in the Mediterranean region
to obtain increased flows of FDI and introduce the necessary laws,
policies, regulations and procedures. FDI requires domestic political
stability, sound economic policies and a minimum of restrictions
on commercial and market forces, thus ushering in capital, management
expertise and technology, given the appropriate infrastructure
in terms of policies and institutions. To this effect, it is important
that the effectiveness of various schemes, such as investment
guarantee schemes, incentives, including fiscal ones, for joint
ventures are evaluated on a country-specific basis. The countries
which seem to have the potential to attract important flows of
FDI due to their strategic position, economic and political stability
and market-based laws and regulations are Malta, Cyprus, Turkey
and Israel. Most of the Maghreb-Mashreq region, with the exception
of Tunisia and to a lesser extent Morocco still suffer from political-economic
problems which have to be addressed prior to the constant inflow
of FDI.<BR>

<P>
Although regionalism is constantly, and rightly, advocated empirically
in a pan-Mediterranean context, yet world trade and investment
is increasingly dominated by global strategies and the dominant
role of multinational corporations. Inter-industry trade, reflecting
large differences in relative factor endowments between two groups
of countries (for example northern Mediterranean and southern
Mediterranean) may increase over the coming decades although this
form of international trade would be &quot;crowded out&quot; by
EU-Central and Eastern Europe trade relations. <B><FONT SIZE=2>5.
Environment<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
The Mediterranean region has one of the most fragile environments
at a world-wide level. The potential problems are compounded given
the rising population pressures and competing land and water uses
within relatively limited areas. Environmental issues should be
tackled at a regional or international level given that the problems
have a cross-border dimension. Urgent measures are necessary in
the areas of coastal resource management, tourism development,
agriculture, fisheries and aquaculture and protection of natural
and historic sites. Whilst the recently-created Mediterranean
Commission for Sustainable Development through the UN Mediterranean
Action Plan (MAP) (whose juridical framework is the Barcelona
Convention (1976)) is undoubtedly welcome, it is imperative to
set in place the necessary regulatory and economic instruments.
Environmental policy needs to be fully integrated with other policies.
Within this context, for example, it is high time that tourism
and environmental policy are integrated.<BR>

<P>
There needs to be a regulatory body which oversees the implementation
of existing laws and regulations, including economic instruments
like pollution charges, user charges, resource pricing and fines/fees.
The Commission should also operate a Mediterranean Environmental
Facility (similar to the Global Environmental Facility) to protect
biodiversity in the Mediterranean area and the Mediterranean sea.
Eventually, the Mediterranean Commission for Sustainable Development
could also develop a role as a Mediterranean Environmental Authority.
<BR>

<P>
Finally, attempts should be made to quantify any form of environmental
degradation within the region and account for it within the national
accounting framework, strengthening that regional environmental
information system which, for example the Observatoire Mediterraneen
of the Blue Plan (part of the UN Mediterranean Action Plan) is
operating. A pilot exercise should be launched to quantify the
impact of Mediterranean tourism on the economies and natural environments
of all Mediterranean countries and could eventually be extended
to other sectors - agriculture, industry, energy and transport,
thus introducing green accounting within each Mediterranean country.
<BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>6. Tourism<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
Sustainable tourism development in the region is a priority area.
The proposed creation (by Malta) of a Mediterranean Travel Commission,
modelled on the European Travel Commission, is timely given the
recent Agreement by Mediterranean States to expand the scope of
the Barcelona Convention in monitoring littoral development.<BR>

<P>
It is proposed that from an early stage a close working relationship
be established between the Mediterranean Corporation for Industrial
Development and the Mediterranean Commission for Sustainable Development.

<P>
The setting up of the necessary institutional framework to monitor
the effects of further industrial and tourism development in the
coastal areas across the Mediterranean region becomes of major
importance.<BR>

<P>
<B>III. The challenge<BR>
</B>
<P>
The public and private sectors in each of the countries bordering
the Mediterranean have important challenges for the coming years
to introduce the necessary regulatory measures and create the
right business environment for balanced economic growth and the
promotion of private initiative. Protecting the environment and
integrating environmental policy into industrial, energy, agricultural
and tourism policy should also feature as a priority on the policy
agenda. Four main Centres which would promote and monitor sustainable
economic development in the Mediterranean region are: <BR>

<OL>
<LI>an Agriculture, Food and Nutrition Research Centre; 
</OL>

<P>
(2) a Mediterranean Centre for Research and Development in Marine
Industrial Technology;<BR>

<P>
(3) a Mediterranean Corporation for Industrial Development with
special emphasis on micro-enterprises and SMEs;<BR>

<P>
(4) a Mediterranean Travel Commission.<BR>

<P>
The Mediterranean Commission for Sustainable Tourism can already
provide an important catalyst for most of these proposals and
could, through the legal framework of the Barcelona Convention,
offer a basic institutional structure for consolidation and further
expansion. With the mobilisation of the necessary financial and
political support from all countries in the region it is possible
to tap the necessary human and financial resources so that these
institutions are set up by the end of this decade equipping the
Mediterranean region to better meet the challenges of the next
Millenium.<BR>

<P>
The challenge, then, is to avert those seeds of danger which,
taking root in economic soil, can sprout social and political
pressures, their tentacles menacing military security. More importantly,
the 'new' security of the Mediterranean should be one that guarantees
the application of basic human rights, without whose observance
there can be no stability, military or otherwise.<BR>

<P>
Indeed, economic insecurity may unfold in the Mediterranean, in
a neo-colonialist scenario where hegemony is fomented and exercised
through economic and financial instruments.
<P>
The marked reluctance, for example, of the more advanced European
states to support a Mediterranean development bank has less to
do with the avowed abundance of venture capital than with greed
and the creed of favouring bilateral, rather than multilateral
co-operation, the former allowing that master-client relationship
whose raison d'etre is not, now, the supply of armaments but the
channeling of foreign investment; and this, in such a form and
with such design as to perpetuate a vassal dependence more thrilling
and binding than ever offered by arms.<BR>

<P>
Cicero would today declaim <I>cedant arma economiae</I>, not <I>togae</I>!
<BR>

<P>
That form and design is expressed in a number of ways, such as
the terms of loans and grants, the former in crippling national
debts, the latter, more subtly, in conditions that so regulate
the grant as to compel the client-state to engage the master's
consultants, accept their project and buy the required technology
from the master. More nefariously, the relationship is sometimes
one where the client-state is de facto forced to introduce in
its territory relatively obsolescent and polluting processes.
<BR>

<P>
In rather paternalistic overtures, Barcelona (November 1995) encouraged
southern Mediterranean states to seek private investment, eschew
public ownership and generally to promote market economies in
the belief that the great magic wand of prosperity could only
be waved by capitalism, oblivious to the socio-political structure
of many of these states where the private sector, in so far as
it exists, is often the oligarchic preserve of a closed and restraining
nomenclature. <BR>

<P>
It is important that the north concretely help the south to promote
the private sector, not limiting itself to declamatory rhetoric.
Tourism, too, itself a useful source of foreign exchange and employment
generation for the southern Mediterranean , tends to be manipulated
by a handful of major Western tour operators more bent on a culture
of swift returns rather than that of a tourism based on the enjoyment
of that symbolic and natural heritage which the Mediterranean
has so uniquely assembled for the huddling 'northern' masses.
There, too, the hegemony spreads, the southern states being at
the mercy of the north for the direction and quality of a tourism
they have to 'welcome', at a price which has not only ecological
costs but also deep socio-cultural scars.
<P>
For we witness in fact not the adaptation of the tourist to his
vacation land; but the attempt to 'dress' the authentic south
in the fashion of the northern costume, accentuating that social
change which the western mass media already export to an 'entertainment'
hungry south.<BR>

<P>
It is the 'western' style of life of the north, in its tempting
allure to a youth seeking 'liberation' from the perceived fetters
of inhibiting traditions, that, by the implied superiority of
the economic and political regimes in which it flourishes, abets
the new imperialism enforced by socio-political models.<BR>

<P>
In conclusion, then, one must caution against the notion that
cultural tourism is an altogether socially positive value, or
a necessarily economically productive process. It must be planned
and managed in the socio-economic and socio-cultural setting of
the Mediterranean world and adapted to the traditions and styles
of the different receiving countries in the region. The cost-benefit
result of the exercise should ultimately be, in both economic
and social terms, a plus for those countries; but those responsible
for the promotion and direction of the industry must bear in mind
that at stake are human resources whose management must be inspired
beyond Mammon.<BR>

Relations, Mediterranean Academy of Diplomatic Studies, Malta

<P>
Today, the Mediterranean region is characterised by a multitude
of problems and challenges. They include wide socio-economic disparities
among the coastal states, migratory pressure, environmental degradation,
political instability and the expansion of various forms of extremism,
in addition to other sources of tension such as ethnic and minority
issues, boundary disputes, conflict over resources and arms proliferation.
<BR>

<P>
On the southern shores of the Mediterranean in particular, the
consequences of economic problems and population explosion contribute
to exacerbate an already difficult socio-political situation.
In part, this is the result of the disequilibrium between the
levels of development on the northern and southern shores of the
Mediterranean. Socio-economic tensions and potentially unstable
political systems affect the domestic situation in many countries
of the southern shore, fuelling migration towards Europe and forming
a fertile ground for the development of religious extremism. In
addition to that, the concentration of military arsenals in the
area remains at alarming levels because of a preoccupation with
declared and potential conflicts.<BR>

<P>
Within this degree of diversity of risks and challenges, there
is a clear interrelation in security terms among the countries
of the region, deriving mainly from their growing interdependence.
This interrelation suggests the need for a cooperative approach
to security. Indeed, only co-operation will make it possible to
tackle and solve the problems of security and latent instability
in the Mediterranean.<BR>

<P>
Actually, attempts at generating a dialogue on issues of direct
interest to the countries in the region have a fairly long history
dating back to the early 1970s. The immediate cause for their
ineffectiveness is to be found in the conditions prevailing at
the time of the East-West confrontation. The end of the Cold War
and the breakthroughs in the Middle East peace process have lifted
many of the constraints on regional co-operation in the Mediterranean.
Indeed, many comprehensive or partial co-operation initiatives
have seen the light of the day since the collapse of the Berlin
Wall. <BR>

<P>
Among the initiatives aimed at establishing a regional co-operation
framework the EU-sponsored Euro-Mediterranean Partnership deserves
special mention. In June 1994, at their meeting in Corfu, the
Heads of Government of the European Union asked the EU Commission
to provide an evaluation of the existing Euro-Mediterranean policy
and to make proposals for strengthening it. The Commission responded
to this request with a document which proposed the creation of
a regional partnership and led to endorsement at the European
Council in Essen in December 1994 of a new approach to relations
with the Mediterranean countries. On 27-28 November 1995, the
fifteen EU member countries and twelve Mediterranean states (Morocco,
Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt, Israel, Palestine, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria,
Turkey, Cyprus and Malta) met in Barcelona and approved a blueprint
for an ambitious Euro-Mediterranean Partnership aimed at fostering
free-trade and closer co-operation in the region. The Partnership
embraces politics and security, economic and financial development,
and social, cultural and human affairs.<BR>

<P>
To examine current security trends and prospects for co-operation
in the Mediterranean in the wake of the Barcelona Conference,
the Mediterranean Academy of Diplomatic Studies, University of
Malta, organized a two-day Colloquium on &quot;Co-operation and
Security in the Mediterranean: Prospects after Barcelona&quot;,
on 22-23 March 1996, in Malta. <BR>

<P>
The Colloquium sought to promote a constructive exchange of views
on issues of security, stability and co-operation in the Mediterranean
following the establishment of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership.
It brought together over thirty experts from the Mediterranean
region, Europe and the United States, representing governments,
international organizations, foreign policy institutes and the
academic community. A number of these individuals made presentations
at the Colloquium and their papers are included in this volume.
<BR>

<P>
The papers collected in Part One and Part Two discuss the outcome
of the Barcelona Conference as seen from the Northern and Southern
rim of the Mediterranean respectively. Part Three examines various
aspects of Mediterranean security and co-operation. Although contributors'
opinions may diverge on specific political, economic or socio-cultural
issues, a consensus seems to emerge on the importance of the process
started in Barcelona as a milestone in the relations between Europe
and its Mediterranean neighbours. <BR>

<P>
It is hoped that the papers contained in this volume will contribute
to a better informed debate on the multiplicity of issues and
challenges confronting the Mediterranean on the eve of the 21<SUP>st</SUP>
century. <BR>

<HR>

<P>
Until recently not many were willing to concede that there exists
a specific Mediterranean regionality. That is to say, considering
the great diversity and disparity that exist among its component
parts, does the Mediterranean possess the characteristics that
qualify it to be approached as a single region? No other geographical
area of comparable size incorporates such widely diverse characteristics
and problems and, inevitably, conflict situations and potential.
This concentration of diversity and disparity, with its conflict
potential,in part accounts for the failure on the part of many
riparian states themselves to seek, recognise and promote a common
Mediterranean identity. Yet paradoxically, security in its widest
definition is probably the single most important factor that qualifies
and requires the Mediterranean to be approached as a single region.
Partly as a result of the end of the East-West confrontation,
partly as a side product of Europe&iacute;s own integration process,
the subject of security in the Mediterranean has, quite suddenly,
become a focus of international attention. Mediterranean regionality
is now treated as axiomatic. <BR>

<P>
It is symptomatic of the modern history of the Mediterranean that
the international actors most prepared to regard it as a single
region have been those possessing global interests, viewing it
as a function of those interests. The west&iacute;s post-World
War II definition of the Mediterranean as &euml;Europe&iacute;s
southern flank&iacute; accorded to it such astrategic regionality
- as a function of European security. The Soviet Union likewise
came to regard the Mediterranean as a strategic unit, engaging
in a maritime competition with the predominant United States.
Of course this view of regionality, the corollary of bringing
the Cold War down to the Mediterranean, had nothing to do with
fostering the coherence of the region. Neither did it have as
its primary aim the solution of the problems that afflicted the
Mediterranean people themselves.<BR>

<P>
In a different way and on a different plane, the consolidation
of the European Economic Community in time led to another major
international actor addressing the region as a single entity,
through its comprehensive Mediterranean policies, acknowledging
the importance of striking an economic relationship with its immediate
neighbourhood. Despite many shortcomings, this Mediterranean policy
did seek a relationship of interdependence with Mediterranean
non-member states, revealing a clear sensitivity to the political
dividends of such a relationship. By the 1970s, the European Community
was overtaking the United States as the mainstay of economic and
political, though not of course military, support to many Mediterranean
countries. Especially after the worst of the first Cold War phase
was over, Euro-American disagreement - or at least failure to
co-ordinate policy and action - surfaced over security matters
outside the strict framework of the east-west confrontation. And
this failure to see eye to eye is chiefly noticeable with regards
to Mediterranean affairs. <BR>

<P>
If the USA regarded local problems from the perspective of a world
power with world views, the Mediterranean and its parts were no
exception. The global problem being security in relation to the
USSR, its Mediterranean policy aimed to contain USSR influence.
If US national security interests - as opposed to the broader
western world&iacute;s security interests - were not directly
affected by specific problems of the Mediterranean, the same cannot
be said of western Europe, itself in part Mediterranean. Unlike
the USA, the Europeans could not afford the end-justifies-the-means
approach. Thus for example, where the USA could live with the
contradiction that several south European allies were governed
by right wing antidemocratic regimes, as this was in itself a
guarantee of anti-communism, the Europeans were less comfortable
condoning such regimes on their doorstep. European support for
democratic transition in Portugal, Spain, Greece and Turkey has
been on the whole consistent and concrete.<BR>

<P>
One feature of Euro-American disagreement has been the limits
of NATO&iacute;s scope, with the Americans urging NATO to broaden
its scope to include objectives not related to the Soviet threat
in Europe and the Europeans keen to reserve NATO for the defence
of Europe and its members. In the circumstances, the most likely
candidate areas for so-called out-of-area operations were in the
Mediterranean and its environs, notably the Middle East. Nonetheless,
whereas the United States failed to address NATO to areas adjacent
to, but outside, Europe, in the Mediterranean it unilaterally
pursued security policies that were neither related to any threat
to Europe or to defence from the USSR. This it could do thanks
to its heavy naval presence and its network of military bases
in the Mediterranean. This ability to act in Europe&iacute;s neighbourhood
independently, combined with Europe&iacute;s resistance to the
Alliance&iacute;s operating outside its original brief, resulted
in the Euro-American allies sometimes pursuing different or even
competing policies in the Mediterranean.<BR>

<P>
Other than the defence of Europe&iacute;s southern flank from
the Soviet threat, US policy in the Mediterranean increasingly
came to focus on Middle Eastern oil, especially following the
1973 oil shock. By the late 1970s, this objective had become prominent
enough for the United States to institute the Rapid Deployment
Force, and for constant American surveillance of the Persian Gulf.
It happenedalso that the late 1970s and early 1980s saw a scrambling
of regional alignments in the Middle East, through a series of
events including the change of regime in Iran, the Soviet invasion
of Afghanistan, and the beginning of the Iran-Iraq war. The late
1970s therefore intensified American sensitivity to the issue
of Middle Eastern oil, just as the &euml;second Cold War&iacute;
was beginning. <BR>

<P>
In summary, for almost half a century security in the Mediterranean
has been defined by powers and forces that were either external
or peripheral to the Mediterranean. Whether in terms of Europe&iacute;s
southern flank, or the western world&iacute;s supplies of oil,
or simply as an arena of superpower naval competition, the matter
of broader Mediterranean security was not in the charge of the
Mediterranean riparian states. <BR>

<P>
The contradiction was that while the Mediterranean was regarded
as a area where Europe and the west in general had vital security
interests, the non-European Mediterranean was not and could not
be involved in European security concerns. The contradiction surfaced
more than once in the councils of the Conference on Security and
Co-operation in Europe (CSCE). Whereas the purpose of the CSCE
was to foster security through co-operation in Europe, the main
theatre of the East-West conflict, it proved difficult to persuade
member states, most especially the superpowers, to extend the
scope of the conference to include the whole Mediterranean. As
a result, whatever achievements were made with regards to European
security were not reflected with regards to Mediterranean security.
<BR>

<P>
No sooner was the mantle of the Cold War lifted from international
relations than the extent of the problems of the Mediterranean
became highlighted. If anything, the security problems of the
Mediterranean appear bigger today than they did before 1989. The
only area of progress registered has been the Middle East peace
process, and even that required a major international war in the
Middle East to set it afoot. In compensation, warfare reminiscent
of the nineteenth century erupted in the Balkans, south-north
emigration has accelerated, and fundamentalism has spread in numbers
and militancy in different parts of the Mediterranean.
<P>
The two movements of emigration and fundamentalism are indeed
a barometer of the degree of distance that has been allowed to
develop between the two opposing shores of the Mediterranean,
with the former denoting despair and flight, and the latter resignation
and rejection of the western model of the state with its broken
promises.<BR>

<P>
The question of the future for Mediterranean security in the post-Cold
War era cannot ignore the experience of the past decades, even
if the international situation today is substantively different
from what it was a few years ago. During the past half-century,
the Mediterranean has not only been a theatre of east-west confrontation,
chosen by the non-Mediterranean protagonists of that contest for
its strategic relevance to the main theatre. 
<P>
Less spectacularly but equally importantly and certainly more
durably, the Mediterranean is a political equator between the
two hemispheres of north and south. The healing of one divide
(the east-west) has little or no relevance to the surviving one.
If anything, the north-south divide here is the more glaring for
that reason.<BR>

<P>
For better or worse, the future of Mediterranean security will
continue to be intimately bound with European security. The question
of which security structure will prevail in Europe would seem
to be central to the future of Mediterranean security. Equally
relevant is the nature of the relationship that will evolve between
Europe and the United States - and perhaps also Russia. <BR>

<P>
The question comes down to a simple one: will Europe formulate
its security in collaboration with its southern neighbours, or
will it formulate it in confrontation with them? This is a good
time to posit such questions, not only because security concerns
in the Mediterranean are serious and immediate, but also because
Europe&iacute;s security architecture is in a state of flux. In
part, this is also because identifying the direction from where
European security might be threatened is less easy today than
it was in the later 1940s. On the eastern front, the Soviet threat
has disappeared, but the long tradition of distrust and fear of
Russia have not. On the southern front, meanwhile, the threat
to European security is not a military one - and therefore there
is no simple way of dealing with it. Indeed, the only way to deal
with it appears to be the long and laborious process of healing
the causes. If that is the solution - and certainly from a Mediterranean
point of view it is the best solution - a lot will depend on which
security structure ultimately prevails in Europe, how such a structure
will define European security interests, and what the true targets
of its protagonists are. <BR>

<P>
Until now, of the different European security organisations, NATO
is the clear front-runner. Quickly shedding its Cold War function
it redefined itself as a long term security through co-operation
organisation with a rapid trouble-shooting capability. In so doing
it assumed functions and objectives that collectively subsume
the functions and objectives of its potential competitors, while
proclaiming itself ready to co-ordinate its activities with them.
<BR>

<P>
Furthermore, through the Partnership for Peace it has extended
its field of operations to include practically all of Europe.
By placing itself at the disposal of the CSCE, NATO has circumvented
the problem of replicating the functions of that organisation,
without however giving up its freedom to act on its own initiative.
The future of other, competing, security set-ups which have resurfaced
or come into being after the fall of the Berlin Wall is uncertain,
and the degree of overlap between the different set-ups and initiatives
is bewildering. CSCE, NATO, The Western European Union, the Pact
for Stability in Europe and the embryonic Common Foreign and Security
Policy of the EU may be similar but different. But it will take
time, for some coherence to emerge between all these set-ups if
it ever does. Some are independently making moves and soundings
to address the Mediterranean. What is not clear is whether these
are motivated by the notion of a common Euro-Mediterranean destiny
or by their perception of the southern Mediterranean as a potential
foe.
<P>
In theory, NATO might have disbanded as soon as the Soviet Union
gave up the fight. In theory too, the obvious set-up for the future
security of Europe was the CSCE, for if the concept of achieving
security through co-operation could be valid in a confrontational
situation, it would be even more valid in a peaceful one. Indeed
it is the mission of the CSCE that NATO has claimed to adopt as
an alternative to its Cold War mission. And it is over the entire
territory of the CSCE that NATO has been aiming to spread by inviting
all CSCE members to join its Partnership for Peace programme.
The offer by NATO to place itself as an operational body at the
disposal of the CSCE followed logically. <BR>

<P>
The ascendancy of NATO over all other security set-ups with pan-European
objectives, and the corollary of NATO fitting into the CSCE glove
is not necessarily the best security forecast for the Mediterranean.
Reinforcing the Euro-Atlantic security link, it implicitly competes
with the concept of a Euro-Mediterranean security partnership,
by seeming to perpetrate the Cold War-inspired notion that NATO&iacute;s
primary interest in the Mediterranean is the defence of the West&iacute;s
security. It may be argued, if one can ignore the comments of
NATO&iacute;s former Secretary General, that NATO does not harbour
aggressive feelings towards the Arab neighbourhood in the Mediterranean
and the Middle East. It can also be argued that NATO has transformed
its mission and is not solely or primarily an alliance with a
specific adversary, as it used to be <I>vis-a- vis</I>. the Soviet
Union. Nevertheless, when all is said and done, it remains an
alliance concerned with the security interests of its members
only. That being so, every neighbourhood is a potential adversary.
Most importantly, NATO&iacute;s willingness to serve as the instrument
of the CSCE in no way limits its freedom to act independently
of it. For the same reason that Russia does not welcome the expansion
of NATO&iacute;s towards its borders, it must not be assumed that
the Mediterranean neighbours welcome the entrenchment of NATO
as the European security structure par excellence. Under its American
leadership, and with its potential for assuming even out-of-area
missions on behalf of the UN and/or the OSCE, it appears too much
like an instrument of a first-world dominated New World Order.
That is the more so since it does not come under the control of
either the UN or the OSCE. On top of that, then, the United States
itself retains the freedom to act independently, even of its NATO
allies, in this region.<BR>

<P>
A Pax Americana, whether real or perceived, cannot be the ideal
setting for confidence-building. The drawback of having the United
States concerting Euro-Mediterranean security is that, unlike
Europe, which has a neighbour&iacute;s interest in achieving stability
for its own sake, the US is prone to define Mediterranean security
in terms of extra-Mediterranean issues and targets, such as the
oil of the Gulf. The continued definition of Mediterranean security
in terms of extra-Mediterranean objectives can foster further
division by competing with the real concerns of Mediterranean
security as defined by Mediterranean countries themselves. Thus
for example, for all the support that Arab governments gave to
the US-led coalition against Iraq in 1991 in the first test case
of the projected &euml;New World Order&iacute;, it is clear that
the hearts and minds of the Arab populations resented the role
of the United States as guardian of international order inside
the Arab world. <BR>

<P>
Which is also to say that the support of such Arab governments
was dependent on their being undemocratic. The question of democracy
indeed is crucial to the future of any working Euro-Mediterranean
relationship, especially in terms of achieving enduring security.
In terms of experience in supporting democratic transition in
the Mediterranean the European Union has a sound record. 
<P>
In the past, Europe&iacute;s approach of encouraging the combination
of democratic transition and economic development in southern
Europe proved to be more far-sighted than that of condoning authoritarian
regimes on the grounds that their anti-communism made Europe&iacute;s
southern flank safer from Soviet penetration. That experience
ought to serve as the basis for dealing with the Arab Mediterranean
countries, which suggests that fearing democracy because it gives
space to Islamic fundamentalists or because it might produce governments
that do not share western values and objectives is short-sighted.
There is no reason why the maxim that democratic countries make
peaceful neighbours should not apply to the Mediterranean also.
<BR>

<P>
Nor should Europe be pusillanimous about pushing for the required
changes in the internal system of government in its neighbours
across the water. For just as Western Europe could not integrate
parts of itself before those parts became democracies, so it cannot
integrate an entire region which denies democracy to its people.
<P>
It would certainly be against the best of European tradition to
try fostering its own security by shoring up regimes that do not
speak for their own people. It is the surest way, not only of
delaying democratic transition in these societies, but of securing
the enduring distrust of such societies. <BR>

<P>
Conversely, while Arab societies can be expected to be suspicious
of a security system concerted by the United States, these same
quarters seek - and indeed, expect - Europe to be more forthcoming
towards them. If any criticism is levelled towards Europe frontier
quarter, it is that the Europeans have not done enough to assist
them, not that the Europeans must keep to their side of the sea.
After all, it is with Europe, even more than with each other,
that they conduct most of their economic business.<BR>

<P>
It would seem therefore that for Euro-Mediterranean security to
achieve a concrete level of co-ordination, the divide that exists
between north and south has to be acknowledged for what it is,
and the causes addressed squarely, in a context of partnership.
In this light, the best model for a Euro-Mediterranean security
structure and framework appears to be the OSCE. From its inception,
this organisation (as the CSCE) addressed a situation of division,acknowledging
that co-operation amongst adversaries generated confidence and
produced security. It was to be expected - though it has not resulted
in practice - that the termination of the Cold War would crown
the CSCE as the ideal pan-European security framework and structure
to help consolidate the peace in the same way as it had earlier
contributed to defuse tensions. Thus, Russia&iacute;s support
for this line of thought stems from the fact that its position
in the CSCE is one of parity with that of its former adversaries,
a logical expectation in a new order to replace the Cold War division
of Europe. The same logic applies to the Euro-Mediterranean situation.
<BR>

<P>
At the time of the East-West divide, it proved impossible, beyond
declarations, to persuade the CSCE to include the non-European
Mediterranean in its scope and thus acknowledge the inseparability
of European and Mediterranean security interests. Proponents of
that line of action argued that security in Europe achieved to
the exclusion of security in the Mediterranean was tantamount
to the former being achieved at the expense of the latter. If
the protagonists of the CSCE then objected to extend the scope
of the Conference because their chief concern was to bridge the
east-west division of Europe, the same reason cannot apply today.
Today, there are clear signs that Europe is taking very seriously
the implications to its own security of problems that could emanate
from the Mediterranean. <BR>

<P>
Replicating the OSCE on a minor scale through regional arrangements,
such as a Conference on Security and Co-operation in the Mediterranean
(CSCM) and similar initiatives, may be a good start as intermediary
measures leading to a more comprehensive approach. But such initiatives
can become meaningless or worse if they are seen as Europe&iacute;s
way of keeping the problems of the Mediterranean at arm&iacute;s
length. Similarly, to be beneficial, initiatives by NATO or the
WEU to involve themselves in Mediterranean problems cannot aim
to compete with the prospects of a more comprehensive partnership.
What the Mediterranean does not need is a myriad of organisations
trying to upstage each other as its security guardians. On the
other hand, adoption of the principle that Euro-Mediterranean
security is one and indivisible on the basis of a full Euro-Mediterranean
partnership would be a confidence-building measure in itself,
given that a relationship of parity has never existed between
the northern and southern shores of the Mediterranean. In short,
a Euro-Mediterranean partnership should be just that.

<HR>

<P>
First of all, allow me to say a few words about the Council of
Europe. It is the oldest European institution, created in 1949
with the aim to &quot;achieve a greater unity between its Members
for the purpose of safeguarding and realising the ideals and principles
which are their common heritage and facilitating their economic
and social progress&quot; (art. 1a of the Statute of the Council
of Europe).<BR>

<P>
To become a member of the Council a country must accept the principles
of the rule of law and the protection of human rights and meet
the requirements of genuine pluralistic parliamentary democracy.
Within the Council of Europe the respect of the rights of minorities
has also become an important aspect of human rights protection.
<BR>

<P>
Since the accession of Russia on 28 February 1996, our Organisation
counts 39 member States. It is expected that in the coming years
the Council will group all the European countries, thus becoming
a truly pan-European organisation. Moreover, in December 1995
the United States obtained observer status with the Council of
Europe, and Canada and Japan have applied for similar status.
<BR>

<P>
Co-operation in the Mediterranean has been a long-standing feature
of the Council of Europe's activities. However, this co-operation
has until now benefited mainly the Mediterranean member States.
We would have to go a long time back in history to trace the beginning
of our activities on behalf of the Mediterranean countries. Let
me cite, as an example, the creation in 1962 - on the initiative
of the Council of Europe and the OECD - of the International Centre
for Advanced Mediterranean Agronomic Studies, the main purpose
of which is to provide complementary training of technical and
scientific staff in agriculture and development.<BR>

<P>
As far as the Parliamentary Assembly is concerned, it has focused
much attention on environmental issues, proposing several actions
designed to combat the deteriorating environmental situation.
This has led, among other things to the 1975 Treaty of Barcelona
on the protection of the Mediterranean sea, a UN initiative signed
by almost all Mediterranean member States of the Council of Europe,
to an information campaign of the &quot;Centre for documentation
and information on the Environment and Nature&quot; between 1988
and 1991, and to the launching in 1991 of the &quot;Blue Europe&quot;
programme on the elaboration of a pan-European policy on the management
of water resources. <BR>

<P>
The Parliamentary Assembly has organised four major Mediterranean
conferences in Co-operation with the Congress of Local and Regional
Authorities of Europe. The first such Conference was held in Marseille
in 1985 and adopted the Declaration of Marseille, focusing on
the elaboration of several proposals for the resolution of the
environmental problems and the institutionalisation of the dialogue
between the two shores of the Mediterranean. The second, held
in Malaga in 1987, led to a final declaration covering the questions
of tourism, transport and communication in the Mediterranean basin,
and the means to reinforcing interregional co-operation. In 1993
the third Conference of Mediterranean regions was held in Taormina
and the main subjects dealt with were the promotion of dialogue
between the two Mediterranean shores, co-operation in the field
of democracy and human rights in order to guarantee the &quot;Democratic
security in the Mediterranean&quot;, as well as in the field of
environment and immigration. Finally, the fourth Conference was
held in Cyprus in 1995 and focused on the &quot;sustainable development
in the Mediterranean Basin: environment, demography and migrations&quot;,
underlining for the member states of the Council of Europe, the
importance of including North-South co-operation in their Mediterranean
policy and, by means of regional and local authorities and NGOs,
promoting intercultural dialogue, tolerance and the integration
of immigrants in their societies. The fifth Conference is planned
to be held in Languedoc-Roussillon, in 1997.<BR>

<P>
A Parliamentary hearing on co-operation in the Mediterranean is
scheduled to be held in Thessaloniki on 27 May 1996.<BR>

<P>
On the Intergovernmental side, the Council of Europe and the Greek
Ministry of Regional Planning are organising a Seminar in Athens
on 25 and 27 April 1996 on the subject of &quot;The Challenges
facing European Society with the Approach of the Year 2000: Strategies
for the sustainable development of European States in the Mediterranean
Basin&quot; in preparation for the Conference of European ministers
responsible for regional planning, to be held in Cyprus in 1997.
<BR>

<P>
The Council of Europe has also paid much attention to political,
economic and immigration issues in the Mediterranean. <BR>

<P>
One major point of concern has been the conflict over Cyprus.
Whereas a solution to this problem must be found under the a egis
of the Secretary General of the United Nations, the Council of
Europe has closely followed the situation, devoted much energy
and time to efforts of reconciliation and to making constructive
proposals for a solution [cf. Recommendation 1259 (1995) and Resolution
1054 (1995) of Parliamentary Assembly on the situation in Cyprus
-recent political developments]. The Assembly's Rapporteur, Lord
Finsberg, very recently visited Cyprus in preparation of new proposals,
in support of the UN's Secretary General's proposals on a bi-communal
structure, to be presented to the Parliamentary Assembly in June
1996.<BR>

<P>
The second major problem is the instability in the Middle-East
over the Palestinian question. The Assembly has made great efforts
to promote the peace process through visits and goodwill missions
and by fostering contacts between the Israelis and the Palestinians.
This led in 1993 to the adoption of the Recommendation 1221 and
the Resolution 1013 on the Peace Process in the Middle-East.<BR>

<P>
As a result of this initiative, both Mr Yitzhak Rabin and Mr Yasser
Arafat addressed our Assembly on 26 January and 13 April 1994
respectively. More recently, the Assembly has set up five Task
Forces on economic reconstruction and development, youth and education,
local democracy, democratic institution-building, and human rights,
the judiciary and the penitentiary in the Middle -East in order
to prepare a major assembly debate on the peace process next June.
In the meantime, three Task Forces have held their first meetings
with the participation of Israeli, Palestinian and European delegations.
<BR>

<P>
The third major challenge to Europe consists in creating better
co-operation with the countries of the Southern Mediterranean.
In this connection I would like to draw your attention to the
Assembly's work in favour of a better intercultural and interreligious
understanding, which led to the adoption of Resolution 885 (1991)
and 1202 (1993). 
<P>
In Vienna, at the summit meeting of Heads of State and Governments
of the Council of Europe member States, it was declared that &quot;the
deepening of Co-operation in order to take account of the new
European situation should in no way divert us from our responsibilities
regarding North-South interdependence and stability&quot;. In
this spirit, Europe has a responsibility towards the countries
of the Southern littoral, which are not eligible to join the Council
of Europe or the European Union. The Committee of Ministers is
fully aware both that the future of these nearby countries has
a vital bearing on Europe's democratic security and stability
and that it is essential to promote their political, economic,
social and cultural development, in order to contribute to a greater
respect for human rights. For these reasons, the Committee of
Ministers decided, among other things, to set up a working party
of Ambassadors in order to follow up the Parliamentary Assembly's
Recommendation 1249 (1994) on &quot;Co-operation in the Mediterranean
basin&quot;. This group, which is chaired by Dr. Buttigieg Scicluna,
the Ambassador of Malta, has identified a number of areas where
the development of the Council of Europe's relations with the
Mediterranean countries seem potentially useful. The main areas
are: the establishment of democratic institutions, the promotion
of the rule of law and human rights, including minority rights
and equality between women and men, emigration, the fight against
drug-trafficking and drug-use, action against racism and intolerance,
as well as the environment and the common cultural heritage.<BR>

<P>
This contribution also identified a number of Council of Europe
conventions and partial agreements open to accession by non-member
countries and likely to be of interest for the purposes of Mediterranean
co-operation. These concern culture, the environment and wildlife,
and the legal field. Moreover it was proposed that Mediterranean
non-member States could benefit from the accession to two partial
agreements of the Council of Europe, that is to say the &quot;Open
Partial Agreement on the prevention of, protection against, and
organisation of relief in, major natural and technological disasters&quot;
and the one on &quot;the European Centre for Global Interdependence
and Solidarity&quot; or more poignantly referred to as &quot;the
North-South Centre&quot; of the Council of Europe.<BR>

<P>
This Centre could indeed become one of the focal points for Mediterranean
co-operation. For this purpose, the Centre has already set up
a Transmed Programme which includes a youth programme, co-operation
between the media, the setting up of an information system on
Internet for the Mediterranean called Medgate, confidence-building
measures in the Middle-East, cultural exchanges, and co-operation
with organisations of local and regional authorities. In fact,
the initiative for the Transmed activities was taken at the &quot;international
Symosium on Trans-Mediterranean Interdependence and Partnership&quot;,
organised by the North-South Centre in Rome in 1994.<BR>

<P>
For the future I can see three major lines of action. <BR>

<P>
Firstly, the Parliamentary Assembly will continue to play an essential
role in promoting co-operation and political dialogue in the Mediterranean
area. This concerns in particular the Eastern part of the Mediterranean
and the Middle-East. The Assembly will not accept the non-respect
by any member State of the fundamental principles and values of
the Council of Europe in respect of human rights, democracy and
the rule of law. It will also seek to foster a dialogue with the
non-member States on the Southern shore. In this respect, I refer
to the recent participation of the Speaker of the Egyptian Parliament
in the Assembly, when he underlined that: 
<P>
&quot;Europe as a shrine of democracy has on its shoulders double
responsibility, one is internal, and the other is external toward
its Southern neighbours&quot;.<BR>

<P>
Secondly, the Council of Europe could contribute to the implementation
of the Declaration adopted by the Euro-Mediterranean Conference
held in Barcelona in November 1995, in specific fields of its
competence such as culture, education, human rights, immigration,
and the fight against intolerance, xenophobia and racism.<BR>

<P>
Thirdly, increased co-operation among the Mediterranean countries
could be fostered by the North-South Centre.<BR>

<P>
However such existing or new forms of co-operation are contingent
on the political will on all sides, and on whether or not stability
and peace can be maintained in the more troubled parts of the
Mediterranean. <BR>

<P>
In all events, the Council of Europe's contribution will have
to be modest in financial terms, but may be very significant in
political terms. One cannot underestimate the vital role of the
Council of Europe in maintaining and strengthening human rights,
democracy and the rule of law in its member States and its effects
on the Council's immediate neighbours. The need for improved forms
of Europe-Mediterranean co-operation exist. The Council of Europe's
efforts can only act as a catalyst. They will have an effect only
if made in conjunction with the political will and development
efforts of all the Mediterranean partners.

<P>
Here in Malta, a few months ago, we heard President Arafat state
that &quot;security is a way of life&quot; : an important recognition
of the new international attitude in the post-Cold War era, where
confrontation and ideological intransigence have given way to
participation, co-operation and compromise. International security
has undergone radical changes, not only in posture but also in
mentality. Deepening and enlargement are the two directions of
the systemic change that is underway in Europe, with the intent
of projecting security eastward in Mitteleuropa, but also southward
in the Mediterranean. The Barcelona conference, which established
the Euro-Mediterranean partnership, mentioned security only in
its preventive aspects, political and diplomatic, assuming that
the relevant co-operative defence mechanisms would follow suit.
They now have to be addressed openly, without the ambiguities
and misunderstandings of the past.<BR>

<P>
The OSCE established European security mechanisms, which evolved
after the fall of the Wall. Are they suitable for the whole Mediterranean?
And if not, what adjustments could be made to satisfy regional
specificities? The first step can only be broader transparency
and dialogue. Barcelona set a similar framework and method, embracing
the whole region, regardless of the obvious local differences
of situations and perceptions. Security as such was kept aside,
on hold, until other practical prerequisites are in place. The
field should be opened before it can be leveld, and multifaceted
interconnections established, as a prerequisite for transparency,
mutual understanding and trust.<BR>

<P>
In Europe and elsewhere, defence is no longer so much a matter
of territorial defence, but rather of co-operative endeavours,
along the lines drawn by the WEU &quot;common concept&quot;, by
the new &quot;enlargement concept&quot; of NATO, and by OSCE behavioural
principles. This requires, in each country, North and South, not
only more specific commitments and training for peace support
operations, but mainly a more extensive information of public
and parliamentary opinions, to ensure the support that is necessary
for consistency, political sustainability and financing purposes.
<BR>

<P>
This presupposes a more coherent multilateral context, in which
national production of and contribution to security is as important
as the consumption of it, from which many benefitted in the fifty
years under the bipolar stalemate. Furthermore, the new multi-dimensional
and transnational challenges produce at the same time a globalisation
and a fragmentation of the responses. The erosion of state authority
under the pressure of the most varied &quot;self-determinations&quot;
can only be restored by international co-operative endeavours,
in many fields that were up to now the preserve of sovereign national
prerogatives.<BR>

<P>
Today, once a crisis has erupted, it is difficult to intervene,
contain and reabsorb. Prevention and mediatory interposition is
the name of the new game, which implies also interventions in
internal affairs. The UN itself, after the experiences of Somalia
and Bosnia, with their mixture of Chapter 6 and Chapter 7 of the
Charter, is not willing to engage directly in peace enforcement
any more, and will increasingly rely on regional arrangements
duly mandated under the provisions of Chapter 8. Sub-regional
aggregation and agreements are therefore indispensable for stability
and security purposes, which external interventions can only supplement,
not substitute. Especially in the many so-called &quot;out-of-area&quot;
contingencies, ad hoc mechanisms by the &quot;willing and able&quot;
are the most adequate to adjust to the shifting and unforeseeable
combinations and variable factors. Variable geometries and hard
cores apply to every country, whether it already belongs or aspires
to European security architectures (which should in itself dispel
any misperception of a Western hegemonic fortress).<BR>

<P>
This is how things stand in continental Europe. The same principles
and mechanisms should apply to the areas contiguous to it, first
and foremost to the Mediterranean. Strategically, the Mediterranean
area is not a coherent system, its problems are not military in
nature, sub-regional diversities are great. But a common mentality
must spread, similar to that which is applicable to Europe.<BR>

<P>
The WEU &quot;Common concept 27&quot; states that &quot;the Mediterranean
basin is a high priority for European security ... (calling for)
guidelines for co-operation (and) permanent dialogue&quot;, recognising
that there is no direct military threat from the South. Barcelona
has indicated the same initial stepping-stones. Soft security
measures, dispelling misperceptions, could consist in exchanges
of information, an inventory of the commitments undertaken, a
comparison of experiences, a review of co-operative models (for
peacekeeping operations, crisis prevention, consultation, assistance
- in particular within OAU; for non-proliferation; for the containment
of new risks). <BR>

<P>
An evolutionary process is underway, rather than a state of affairs,
in each of our countries, in continental Europe as well as in
the Mediterranean. For mutual relations to develop, the rediscovery
of one's own and each others' identities is a prerequisite, that
must involve the participation of all of the strands of our civil
societies.<BR>

<P>
Even the military instrument is nowadays subjected to these multiple
factors, as it adapts to a new preventive role, under conditions
of greater transparency. Prevention is the overriding requirement,
involvement rather than containment the new imperative. Transparency
and exchange of views and experiences are the essential instruments.
Pluralism of contributions constitute at the same time the goal
and the prerequisite for further advances.<BR>

<P>
In the Mediterranean, the North-South relationship must expand,
but it presupposes a South-South two-way street. European states
individually and the Commission must evolve beyond their bilateral
relationships with North African states. The Fifteen cannot however
deal with the North Africans one by one, lest they be accused
of ganging up: Europe, as Kissinger used to remind Europeans,
needs to dial &quot;one telephone number&quot; to reach most usefully
its North African partners.<BR>

<P>
After the Ministerial Council of Petersberg in June 1992, the
Mediterranean Group of the WEU indicated seven principles that
should inspire the Euro-Mediterranean endeavour in the security
field. They are: dialogue, transparency, confidence, conflict
prevention, sufficiency, peaceful settlement of conflicts and
non-proliferation of armaments.<BR>

<P>
Now that a broader concept of security is being accepted also
in the Mediterranean, the opportunity exists of addressing the
relevant military concepts, starting with CSBMs. They should achieve
transparency (through communications, exchanges, common strategic
language), co-operation (in PKOs also within OAU, humanitarian/civil
protection, nonproliferation and the tackling of new risks), working
groups (for bilateral, trilateral co-operative purposes), and
multinational operational endeavours (such as manoeuvres and exercises).
<BR>
<BR>

<P>
With such CSCMs, collective security would develop, as a process,
incrementally, in the Mediterranean as usefully as in continental
Europe, in the context of the partnership established in Barcelona.
<BR>

<P>
Since Barcelona, WEU within EU and the Mediterranean have a clear
road ahead of them. Political will should combine the evolving
events to provide the energy for all parties concerned to proceed
with a converging purpose, even if with different national contributions.

<H3><A HREF="#opening">Official opening</A></H3>

<P>
Twenty one <A HREF="partic.htm">participants</A> from sixteen
Commonweatlh countries were welcomed to the Workshop on the Use
of Information Technology in International Relations in Malta,
by Dr Jovan Kurbalija, Head of Unit for Computer Applications
in Diplomacy, <A HREF="http://www.medac.comnet.mt">Mediterranean Academy of Diplomatic Studies, </A>University
of Malta , Mr. Henry Alamango, Director of the <A HREF="http://www.comnet.mt">Commonwealth Network in Information Technology for Development (COMNET-IT).</A>as
well as Professor Fred Tanner, Director of the Mediterranean Academy
of Diplomatic Studies.The two institutions, sited in Malta were
co-sponsors of the Workshop in collaboration with the Maltese
Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Representatives of the Maltese Ministry
of Foreign Affairs, the Commonwealth Secretariat, and students
from the Mediterranean Academy of Diplomatic Studies in Malta
were also in attendance at the opening session.
<P>
The Workshop was officially opened by Ambassador Victor Camilleri,
Permanent Secretary in the Maltese Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
In his <A HREF="#framework">address</A> he took note of the fact
that the Workshop was being held within the context of Malta's
Third Country Programme which had recently been launched jointly
with the Commonwealth Secretariat and which, with the involvement
of COMNET-IT, would promote human resource development in Commonwealth
countries to bridge the gap between the developed and developing
countries in the acquisition of new technologies. Ambassador Camilleri
underscored the fact that &quot;... with the media and communication
explosion, diplomacy is being transformed into a new state-of-the-art
technological information network- a global village - where the
management of political, eonomic and social issues can be conducted
through the information superhighways, amongst which was the Internet...making
it possible to bring minds together, in thinking together, in
acting together in meeting the challenges of the new millenium.&quot;
<P>
The reception which followed the official opening provided an
opportunity for the participants to engage in meaningful discussion
with invited guests on a number of related issues..<HR>

<H3><A HREF="#framework">General Framework of the Workshop</A>
</H3>

<H5>Major Objectives of the Workshop</H5>

<UL>
<LI>To introduce the use of Information Technology in International
Relations to small Commonwealth developing and other states with
limited resources.
<LI>To contribute to the overall strengthening of the capacity
of the countries concerned in both conducting their external relations
and participating in a meaningful manner in subregional, regional
and worldwide diplomatic activities.
</UL>

<H5>Conceptual Approach and Methodology</H5>

<P>
The workshop activities were coordinated by Dr. Jovan Kurbalija.
Interaction was based on a conceptual and practical approach which
included the traditional format of lectures/seminars as well as
IT-based slide and multi-media presentations. Each module was
followed up by computer simulation exercises.Participants were
exposed to the varied experiences of other governments and managers
in the acquisition and implementation of information technology
in diplomatic activities by way of presentaions from representatives
of the governments of Malta, the United Kingdon and Germany as
well as representatives of the Malta Systems Unit Ltd. Particular
attention was paid to the efforts of Malta- a developing country
aspiring to membership of the European Union - in the application
of information technology in the conduct of its international
relations.
<P>
An Electronic Embassy, comprising five fully equipped computers
with multi media and Internet facilites, was set up at the workshop
to provide participants with daily practical experience in the
use of computer hardware and software applications, such as word
processing, spread sheets, databases which could be particularly
helpful in offfice automation. It was agreed that as a conclusive
exercise participants would create a Home page for the Workshop
on the Internet.<HR>

<H3>Opening of Electronic Embassy</H3>

<P>
The first session provided participants with an overview of the
various IT facilities which were available in the Electronic Embassy.
These included electronic mail and the Internet which were the
two areas of IT to which participants were hitherto least exposed
within the context of Diplomacy and International Relations.

<P>
<B>Introduction :</B>
<P>
IT has led to a new political, economic and social environment
for international relations which is characterised by interdependence,
interconnectivity and profound change. The impact of these changes
are both positive and negative.
<P>
<B>IT and changes in modern society</B> 
<P>
  - IT has fueled the transition from the industrial towards the
information society.
<P>
<B> IT and sovereignty</B> 
<P>
- IT has not superseded but eroded sovereignty. The national legal
system, for example, can be by-passed by network 
<P>
  piracy and the accessing of pornography where prohibited.
<P>
<A HREF="#Joe_Woods">IT and international relations (concept of power)</A>

<P>
- IT has produced not only a change in the concept of power but
also in the source of power. As a consequence of
<P>
  IT, for example, the economic clout of the Republic of China
has been recognised despite the political standing of the
<P>
  People's Republic of China, inter alia, as a permanent Member
of the United Nations.
<P>
- Fibre optics, has, additionally, changed geopolitics in that
Marseilles, France, is now the new geopolitical centre, a
<P>
   position formerly held by Gibralta, Malta and Cyprus.
<P>
<B>IT and cultural diversity</B> 
<P>
- Through IT all States have the means to promote and exploit
their own cultures and interests.
<P>
<B>IT and international economy</B> 
<P>
- IT has facilitated the economic growth of the &quot;Asian Tigers&quot;.
<P>
<B>Evaluation:</B>
<P>
- IT is to modern society what rail was initially to industry.

<P>
- Information has always been power, but it is now no longer the
monopoly of big and /or rich countries.
<P>
- Are the resultant implications being applied in national policy
and personal lifestyle goals?

<P>
Introduction:
<P>
Thesis: IT should not be for its own sake( titillation, bemusement)
but rather for <A HREF="#Commonwealth">empowerment.</A> 
<P>
Main points:
<P>
The ability to produce a value -added component is now a resource
in itself. The possession of natural resources is therefore no
longer obligatory for economic growth.
<P>
Interdependence and interconnectivity producing globalisation
now means that &quot; the world's problems are now yours&quot;,
that is , the national context is now affected.
<P>
This new environment produces opportunities and threats. The response
can either be reactionary or proactive and visionary. The former
results in despair and fear. Embracing the latter can lead to
a quantum leap.For example, the appreciation of the concept of
interconnectivity emphasised by Mediterranean litoral States has
caused a policy shift in the political and economic relation between
the European Union and the Mediterranean.[Hyperlink : Maltese
intiative on stability to Eureo-Mediterranean Conference.] IT
and globalisation constitue the motto of Malta's Vision 2000 strategy
by which it is hoped to make Malta a leader in international business
and restore her as the hub of the Mediterranean.
<P>
A further consequence is the potential for a shift in the global
balance of power in international relations between small and
third States. It was stressed that the Commonwealth could take
the lead in this regard.
<P>
Size is therefore no longera disadvantage but an asset, given
the generally greater adaptability and homogenity of small States.
<P>
Small States can now participate competetively in new strategic
alliances with big States. For example, Malta is now being considered
as a hub by the United States to access North African market.
<P>
Maximisation of IT requires an attitude shift for sustainable
development.
<P>
<A NAME="Commonwealth">Evaluation</A> 
<P>
-Are the implications of IT in the new global environment being
applied in national policy? From Mr. Wood's presentation, the
answer is a resounding 'yes' in the case of Malta.
<P>
- Mr. Wood's concept of 'quanatum leap' and attitude shift' though
reminiscent of former United States President Ronald Reagan's
&quot;Star Wars', is intriguing with historical precedent in the
development of technology in general. It should therefore be tested
in the very context he proposes: a new attitude and strategy for
small states in the commonwealth. For example, the Commonwealth
should adopt a pilot project whereby its small states not only
network in an agreed area of strength/advantage, but also establishing
an area of strategic alliance with bigger sister commonwealth
states.
<P>
<B>IT INITIATIVES IN THE COMMONWEALTH</B>
<P>
Presenter: Dr. Sajda Qureshi, Commonwealth Seceretariat, London
<P>
Introduction
<P>
Analysis of national development of countries have shown that
the locus of growth of national economic development cannot merely
be explained in terms of labour and capital. There is a third
factor and it is the technological factor. On a world scale, the
evolution of completed strategic planning as a field of practice,
which began during the 1960s decade, views the 1990s decade as
the decade during which human resources development and utilisation
and technology and development are, and progressively become,
the centre-piece for national development plans of developing
countries countries. For the 1990s and beyond, technology and
human resource development can be described to be inseparable
elements of sustainalble development.
<P>
Main points:
<P>
- IT is disseminated throughout the Commonwealth by
<P>
: products, example: equipment, assembly plants and production
tools
<P>
: human resources; training (individual, group, exchanges, attachnments,
expert and technical assistance, skills upgrading (industrial,
technical, vocational)
<P>
: technology transfer (institutional development, settimg up computer
and data communications networks, rehabilitation of small industrial
enterprises, advisory services, research and development and information
exchange)
<P>
- The source for data on Commonwealth IT initiatives is the Commonwealth
Debt Recording and Managing System (CS - DRMS)
<P>
Evaluation
<P>
Secretariat IT initiatives which have particular significance
for the development and attainment of Commonwealth Secretariat
and member state prioroties are, respectively the Informal Consultative
Group of Information Technology for Development (ICGITD) via a
computer and telecommunications network among identified officials
only from a rangr of international agencies, and the Commonwealth
Secretaarit Debt Recording and Management System and the concept
behind GOVERNET.

<B>ELECTRONIC EMBASSY: OPENING SYSTEMS _ HOW TO CHOOSE THE PROPER
OS FOR MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND DIPLOMATIC NETWORK?</B>
<P>
Presenter: Zoram Ivanovic, Manager, RS/2 International
<P>
Introduction- Why we need OS? Bookmark: Summary notes, third page
<P>
of presenter Zorem Ivanovic
<P>
- Expectations of OS [Bookmark: Summary Notes, fourth page of
presenter Zoran Ivanovic]
<P>
- Business Planning [Hyperlink: Summary Notes, third page of presenter
Helga Pizzuto on 'Business and IT Plans for the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs, Malta and, presentation slides by Dr. gaetan Naudi on
'The Effects of the Introduction of Informatiom Technology in
the mlatese Ministry of Foreign Affairs'
<P>
Main Points:
<P>
How to Choose the right OS?
<P>
:Hardware - combining the old with new equipment will be more
costly in the long run, than investing in all new equipment
<P>
: Users - internal, national, external
<P>
- key players [Hyperlink: summary notes, sxth page, Helga Pizzuto]
<P>
: networking - application of both local area network (LAN); wide
area network (WAN)
<P>
: Internet connection - most direct, easily available node should
be used
<P>
: security - protection should be a joint decision that is, based
on wide consultation [Bookmark: eighth page, Ivanovic]
<P>
: Available software - [Bookmark: ninth page, Ivanovic]
<P>
- [ Hyperlink: Tucker presentation]
<P>
: Budget - The larger ones budget, the more one can satisfy all
aspects of the highest expectations of OS
<P>
[Bookm,ark: sixth and final (future of OS) presentation by Ivanovic]
<P>
Evaluation
<P>
- A trained, updated human resource user and support system whichn
includes human alertness and accountability as the best basis
for security and protection, are the ideal prerequisites for sustainable
MFA OS
<P>
- Networking (LAN and WAN) is the best mechanism for an effective
MFA OS. In this context the Maltese Legal Materials Database has
the potential to be an invaluable resource tool not only for MFAs
globally, but also for relevant regional and international organisations
[Hyperlink: Maltese Legal Materials Database Homepage].

the changes being wrought by IT required an holistic and coordinated
approach towards the management of one's information resources.
She essentially advocated the sharing of the information resource
through an information network across sectors.

The speaker was concerned with the developments in the field of

issues of concern to developing countries and the role of public
policy. His main concern was the sharing of information resources

<P>
The speaker dwelt on the essence of Intellectual Property Rights(IPR).
These are basically aimed at protecting inventors, creators of
literary and artistic works, whilst at the same time giving access
to the users to prevent monopoly by the former. Works and inventions
used to be protected by the Patent, Trademark or Copyright of
the producer. As protection laws and legislations became increasingly
challenged, legislators decided to come up with more methods of
protection such as Protection against Unfair Competition/Antitrust
Law, Trade Secret Law and Contractual. Dr. Camilleri reiterated
on the different national and international legislations which
govern the protection of intellectual property. These legislations
date as far back as 1952 with the Universal Copyright Convention
which was revised in 1971. She looked at the protection of software
within the existing legislative framework illustrating her argument
by the recent United States-China dispute over the production
of US copyrighted software in China.

<B>Electronic Messaging</B> 
<P>
<B>Dr. Spackman, Management Systems Unit Ltd.</B> 
<P>
<U>CHANGING PARADIGMS</U> 
<P>
This presentation focused on the significance of electronic messaging
for Governments. The role and function of conducting government
business is changing as a result of the introduction of Information
Technology (IT) which now facilitates interaction while engendering
productivity and at the same time breaking down the barriers of
time and space.
<P>
<U>THE TECHNOLOGY OF PARADIGM SHIFT</U> 
<P>
The general acceptance of all technology follows the same curve.
There is first of all a resistance phase, evidenced by a slow
curve at the introduction of new technology followed by a slow
induction phase and then a rapid acceptance phase. The growth
begins to fall off at the point of general acceptance of the technology
as a normal way of doing things. At some point in the period of
general accepance a new technology emerges.
<P>
The question that then arises is to recognise the point at which
one should shift from the old to the new technology. This is the
paradigm shift.
<P>
<U>NEW PARADIGMS</U> 
<P>
The effects of the new paradigms have dictated new roles on governments
from one of exerting control to one of service. Governments gave
been forced to become increasingly outward looking and open to
national and public scrutiny as well as global sharing of information.
Governments now see their roles as that of facilitators and supporters
of private enterprises through the provision of appropriate environment
and infrastructures for growth.
<P>
As a result of this new role, governments have had to adopt new
managerial methods which include decentralisation of operations,
networking, sharing of organisation resources, and cooperating
with industries and business enterprises. They have equally realised
that immediacy and sharing of information through IT are necessary
tools for both survival and existence today. This has resulted
in the utilization of certain Key Technologies and their resultant
applications.
<P>
Governments have accepted the need to be part of the global electronic
network society. The use of electronic communication and information
exchange systems such as internet, with its reservations, trans-european
telematic network and the Commonwealth network for Information
Technology for Development are all part of the global network
communication.
<P>
<U>CONCLUSION</U> 
<P>
Electronic messaging has come of age because we are a networked
society . Governments worldwide must IT to the top of their political
agendas. <HR>

<P>
<B>Presentation <U>of</U> the Model of Computerisation of Ministry
of Foreign Affairs</B> 
<P>
<B>Mr. Jovan Kurbalija, Head of Unit for IT and Diplomacy.</B>

<P>
<U>MODELS FOR THE COMPUTERISATION OF THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS</U>

<P>
This presentation positioned diplomacy and the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (MFA) within the overall scheme of international interaction
among states using the Malta experience in the application of
IT. The resultant role of the MFA therefore is that of coordinating
interaction rather than imposing actions in the implementation
of foreign policy. This necessicitated a reliance, to some extent,
on the development by and experience of the business community
in strategising and planning the computerisation of the MFA.
<P>
The strategy adopted by Malta was an initial methodology of internal
network through the linkage of desk officers by Personal Computers
connected to those of Directors while the latter were linked with
that of the Permanent Secretary. This phase resulted in the introduction
of new tools in the automation of the manual tasks of the Ministry
some of which include routine and repetitive activities , information
gathering and thinking intensive activities which have been earlier
been identified.
<P>
The experience indicates that data bases are best developed in-house
for the use of the ministry or missions and that it was important
to decide what databases should be developed in-house. These should
be based on the needs and resources of the ministry. There should
be a clear identification of the procedures, levels of access,
security, applications and software and hardware required. Sources
of other databases should be identified so as to prevent duplication
of efforts.
<P>
<U>THE ELECTRONIC POST MASTER UNIT</U> 
<P>
In furtherance of the establishment of a wider network, the role
of the MFA is further enhanced as a coordinating point of information
based on interactions between other MALTESE missions, other government
ministries, the Business Community, the Academia and other economic
operators.
<P>
In the final analysis, computerisation of the foreign ministry
should have as its objective, the ease of formulation, facilitation,
and implementation of foreign policies.<HR>

<P>
<B>Public Service Reform and IT Polciy</B> 
<P>
<B>Mr. Philip Micallef, Manager, Strategy &amp; Planning Department,</B>

<P>
<B>Management Systems Unit Ltd</B>.
<P>
The major thrust of this presentation was that any reform process
should be approached from an integrated basis. This approach however,
has to balance the strategies for short, medium and long term
planning needs.
<P>
In putting forward his proposal for an integrated approach, Micallef
using the Maltese experience, recalled certain milestone events
and stressed the need for a review of the operations of government
and the role of the Public Service Reform Commission. He underscored
the need for an Information Systems Strategic Plan (ISSP) and
the key issues that should be addressed as well as the principal
factors that were critical for the success of any reform process.
<P>
In the case of Malta, the establishment of the Management Systems
Unit ( MSU) is one of the positive by-products of a successful
ISSP serving as an agent of reform in the civil service of Malta.
In pursuing its objectives and its role in the reforn process
of the public sector, the MSU undertakes strategic planning, consultancy
services, delivery and support services.
<P>
As with all reform processes, there is in Malta, a concern about
value for money as well as opportunity cost in view of the enormity
of investment by government in the process. However, the process
continues.

<P>
Mr Stater discussed the importance of architecture, which deals
with the blueprint of the infrastructure required. He emphasized
the importance of adhering to standard infrastructure in implementing
IT. He introduced the concept of Management Architecture and Models

<P>
<U>COMNET.IT</U> by Mr. Henry Alamango
<P>
Mr Alamango provided a comprehensive talk on COMNET.IT its concept
and objective, processes and organisations and the Maltese Experience.
<P>
<U>Concept and Objective</U> 
<P>
COMNET.IT is to facilitate the Use &amp; Development of Computer
Networks for Exchange of Information &amp; Expertise. It was achieved
through networking of individuals, groups and institutions with
the purpose of accelerating social and economic development through
the <U>use of Computer networks.</U> 
<P>
<U>Processes and Organisations</U> 
<P>
Networking was accomplished through exchange of informations in
all levels; through workshops, discussion groups, publications,
training, provide skills and expertise. Networking also involves
commissioning of R&amp;D on the use of Computer Networks and other
IT, promotion of technical cooperation between various levels
of networks and institutions, eg strategic partnerships and alliances
of relevant organisations; access to information on various topics
available in the Internet.
<P>
COMNET.IT are in two levels: the Strategic and policy making bodies
- Board of Directors and its supporting Secretariat. The second
level is the Tactical and Operational level which links individuals,
task forces in administrative, management reforms, researches,
publication and education. It further links institutions and Operation
Centres, such as NCST, and MSU
<P>
COMNET provides services in five major areas; (I). Network start-up
help which includes advice and training packages and e-mail setup;
(ii). Research and publication which promotes networking in research
projects and receiving feedback from other networks, such as ICA;
(iii). Information Access which provides WAN such as to WWW, CAPAM,
and COMSEC; (iv). It also connects to other development programmes
with IT projects, such as through IDRC and UNDP etc.; (v) COMNET
also provides training activities for networking, communications
and IT applications.
<P>
<U>Governet/ MSU/Malta</U> 
<P>
The Maltese Government had adopted Governet as an administrative
service reform network which provides: E-mail connectivity, end-user
workshop, training, civil service reform dbase, thematic development
through operational centres and task forces, produce newsletters,
connet to internet and www etc.

<P>
<B>General EGM Benefits:</B> 
<P>
EGM will bring about a number of benefits for the users in the
Ministries and Departments, not least of which will be a
<P>
consistent interface for communication, with one set of commands
for faxes, memos, file transfers, and so on. This will add value
to the Government network and enable better communication between
government departments which in turn decreases loss of time in
information handling. The impact of these benefits will ultimately
be felt even by the public in general who will receive more timely
and accurate information.

<P>
IT-policy and the Use of information and communication technology
in the German Foreign Office
<P>
Mr. Pius Fischer, Head of the Section for IT Policy
<P>
German Foreign Office
<P>
Presentation of IT-projects of Foreign and Commonwealth Office
<P>
Head of Strategy Group
<P>
Foreign and Commonwealth Office, London
<P>
Panel discussion with participation of the representatives of
German and UK Foreign Office
<P>
National experiences in the use of IT in the German and British
Foreign offices were shared through separate presentations by
Mr Fischer, Head of the IT section of the German Foreign Office
and Mr Bradford, Head of Strategy Group of the British Foreign
Office. The experiences were further deliberated upon in the ensuing
panel discussion.
<P>
The salient points of Mr Fischer's presentation on IT were: A)
to make work easier and more effective, to speed up transmission
of information and instant access to information; B) to facilitate
communication between missions and ministries of the German Government;
and, C) cooperative decision making, coordination and participation
in decision making through IT.
<P>
He elaborated upon achievements of the German Foreign Office in
the use of IT tools. It was an impressive expose of the high degree
of computerization in various German offices. He informed the
group that there were seven thousand users in the German Foreign
Service and so far 229 Missions have been connected on a Wide
Area Network. The system was used as a world wide network based
on modern technology and customized according to each user's requirements.
The German Foreign Office has arranged extensive training facilities
at headquarters, as well as, in missions which made easy the task
of utilizing the systems potential to the maximum. The system
ensured adequate confidentiality and security against any unauthorized
use. Participants appreciated the achievements but probed specifically
into areas of security management of the system and the cost factors.
<P>
The British representative's presentation mainly focused on the
dismal performance of the system in the late Eighties and early
Nineties when it was adopted without the thoughtful planning and
assessment of available resources. The British FCO had to incur
a net loss of twenty million pounds due to erroneous planning.
However, the situation was quickly rectified in the light of the
Wilding Report of 1978 and Coopers and Lybrand Report of April
1991.
<P>
He was quite candid in admitting that the in built conservatism
of the FCO in adopting new technologies was also responsible for
problems. He then listed certain contributing factors: lack of
resources, security aspects and personnel reluctance to switch
over to new technologies as key reasons for the comparatively
slow introduction of IT in the FCO. However, at the same time
he briefed the group about benefits which can accrue from the
adoption of IT in Foreign Services in a strategic manner. He also
suggested that IT should not be implemented for the sake of modernization
of office methods but in accordance with the specific requirements
otherwise it can prove counter productive. He also stated that
in order to create a culture for the implementation of IT a mix
of rewards and punishments along with change in organizational
structure and planning methods were a pre requisite. He advocated
a cautious approach in this regard and warned about high costs
both in terms of wastage of financial and human resources if proper
planning was not adopted. He also highlighted the fact that to
secure adequate funds for IT, the FCO had to embark upon a concerted
campaign of redundancy of staff. So far 390 jobs at various levels
had been retrenched and another 150 would be surrendered soon.
<P>
Mr Bradford's pragmatic presentation appealed to participants
who acknowledged the need for proper planning in view of the peculiar
developing structure of their economies and financial constraints.
<P>
The panel discussion was very stimulating in view of the shared
concerns and fears about the future and impact of IT in the foreign
services of developing countries. While Mr. Fischer optimistic
about the implementation of IT in the German Public Service, Mr.
Bradford pleaded for a cautious approach to avoid wastage of human
and financial resources.

1. Internet
<P>
The 10th day of the workshop started with a general introduction
to Internet, E-mail, Telnet and FTP, Gopher, Archie, Electronic
Conferences and World Wide Web (WWW) by Jovan Kurbalija. The purpose
of this session was to give the participants the conceptual background
of all these IT tools.
<UL>
<LI>Internet is global network.
<LI>Node is a point of location in home country
<LI>HTTP is indicative for home page
<LI>FTP is for file transfer protocol
<LI>Gopher is file a manager allowing the reorganisation of files.
Instead of going through all the files, you go through Gopher
to get the information guideline e.g. put in GOPHER//UN ORG
<LI>Upload means sending a file or files to pre-specified destination.
<LI>Download means receiving a file or files from other location
<LI>Caveat! With Gopher you cannot bring the full text.
<LI>To find specific information on the Net, one can use search
engines such as Yahoo. This engine is based in Princeton University.
Such other engines include Lycos, CityNet, etc.
<LI>UNIX is an operating system based on a command line. It is
similar to MS-DOS, but it offers many more possibilities. This
is why it is used by most universities.
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT is a 32 bit operating system with graphic
interface.
</UL>

<P>
Moving from concepts to practice, Mr. Kurbalija informed the participants
that he had decided to create a web-site containing all the informations
about the workshop: Programme, list of participants, documents
of the workshop. The structure of this Web site was drafted. Participants
were to create homepages containing the report of each day. For
this purpose participants were divided in groups and given specific
assignments. <HR>

<P>
2. Administration of Foreign Affairs
<P>
Mr. Gaetan Nauci, Director of Cooperate Services in the Maltese
Ministry of Foreign Affairs presented his country's experience
in the introduction of IT in diplomacy. He introduced his speech
by warning the audience that the use of IT was not a panacea.
 Introducing some humour, Mr Nauci said that for some pessimists
the organisation of tomorrow will have two main actors : a dog
and a man. The dog's function will be to prevent man from using
machine and man's function will be to feed the dog. For the optimists
on the other side, machine will do everything and man will just
have to dance  and make love. 
<P>
IT is only a tool to assist in arriving at given objectives. Before
investing in IT , the Government has to address certain key questions
: Is there any need for IT ? What are the advantages of IT compared
to other means of communication ? How should IT be acquired ?
What are the costs of introducing IT and maintaining it ? What
quality is required ? Will IT bring any constraints ? All these
questions imply that a sound feasibility study should carried
out before any commitment is made. This study should give a guarantee
that the equipements are maintainable , adjustable to accommodate
the technology required, up-to-date and competitive with the latest
on the market. 
<P>
Talking from his own experience, he advised that when purchasing
equipments, one should look for the best value for money and not
necessarily the cheapest on the market.
<P>
The introduction of IT in the Maltese Ministry of Foreign Affairs
raised some fears. People were usually afraid of change and many
examples of  inconveniences of IT such as being time consuming
, insecurity, impersonal management, more paperwork, lack of visible
management..
<P>
Nevertheless, the introduction of IT has improved the financial
management of the Ministry. With the Department Accounting System(DAS)
, the Ministry now has a proper budgeting and  a timelier and
better financial management; debtors and creditors are now well
known and convenient reports can easily be obtained.
<P>
He stated finally that if IT is not hurting, then it is not working.
In this business one has to be neither over pessimist nor over
optimist but simply realist.
<P>
During the discussion Mr. Nauci explained that for security reasons,
the use of IT would not replace the traditional mailing systems(diplomatic
bag, diplomatic cargo, and courier services). On the security
of the accounting system, Mr. Nauci said that those actually giving
needed authorisations at various levels will continue to do the
same job but would use a system of passwords whereby each officer
would access only  information relevant to his or her hierarchical
position. An incription system has already been elaborated on,
in order to ensure the security and confidentiality of IT messages.
<HR>

<P>
3. Multimedia - Use in Diplomatic activities. Case Study : Hypermedia
Presentation of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Malta.
<P>
On behalf of the Multimedia Team of the Mediterranean Academy
of Diplomatic Studies, Mr. Milenkovic presented a hypermedia application
built in MS Viewer authoring software. It consisted of the following
main topic groups :
<P>
 A.Ministry of Foreign Affairs
<UL>
<LI>Policy-Foreign of Malta
<LI>- Organization of Maltese Ministry of Foreign Affairs
<LI>-Our Home : Palazzo Parisio Building
</UL>

<P>
This allowed the participants to have an unexpected overview of
the Maltese History.
<P>
  B. Mediterranean Academy of Diplomatic Studies.
<UL>
<LI>- Profile of the Academy
<LI>- Research and Meetings
<LI>-Degree Programmes
</UL>

<P>
   C. IT Projects
<UL>
<LI>-Course in Diplomacy
<LI>-Diplomacy and Information Technology
<LI>-Database of International Legal Documents
</UL>

<P>
Being hypermedia means that the materials consist not only of
a text and images, but also of video clips and sound pieces, organised
in an ordered fashion and connected with hyperlinks, very much
like www pages.
<P>
Hypertext concept has been explained and true hypertext features
(jump another piece of information, insertion of embedded paragraphs
, pop-up windows, graphical navigation map) were discussed in
comparison with www hypertext features.
<P>
The technical methods of acquiring graphical , video and sound
material were explained and advice for acquiring them were given
.<HR>

<P>
4. Electronic Embassy : How to create home pages.
<P>
Mr. Kurbalija informed the participants that he wanted to engage
the creation of home pages for the workshop. It was suggested
that the group as a whole would create a great website for the
workshop. Each two participants were assigned to write on deliberations
on a specific day. Methods and procedures of creating homepages,
hyperlinks, bookmarks etc. were explained . 
<P>
The participants then started creating homepages and some remained
in the computer room over midnight.

<I><B>INTRODUCTION</B></I>
<P>
Following decades of rapid technological development, information
technology (IT) enters into a new phase of growing applications
in most areas of human life. The lower cost and increasing performance
of hardware, as well as the power and easy use of software, have
all come together in a way that will fundamentally alter the way
most people live and work. 
<P>
Diplomacy like many other human activities is profoundly transformed.
Moreover, since the key ingredients of diplomacy - <B>information
</B> and <B>interaction </B>- are nowadays highly automated through
digitalization and networking, the changes in diplomacy is even
more substantial. The development of IT will compel diplomats:
<UL>
<LI>to work in <I>the new social,  political and economic environment
</I>characterized by the changes in the concept of sovereignty,
the emergence of the global economy and global information infrastructure;
<LI>to deal with  <I>new topics</I>  such as protection of intellectual
property on a multilateral and bilateral level, and 
<LI>to use <I>the new tools </I>made available by information
technology, such as automation of office activities, global networking,
 etc..
</UL>

<P>

<P>
These three areas of the interaction between diplomacy and  information
technology are the  conceptual foundation of the Unit for Computer
Applications in Diplomacy.  The Unit's Programme for 1995 focuses
on the following major activities:
<UL>
<LI>Course in Diplomacy and Information Technology
<LI>Research Projects on Diplomacy and Information Technology
<LI>Application Development and Electronic Publishing for Diplomacy

<I>PART I</I>
<P>
<I><B>COURSE IN DIPLOMACY AND INFORMATION </B></I>
<P>
<I><B>TECHNOLOGY</B></I>
<P>
The Course is based on the comprehensive and interdisciplinary
approach to information technology and diplomacy.  Beside providing
training in the use of the computer as a working tool,  the Course
focuses also on various issues raised through the use of information
technology. Thus the main objective of the Course is to provide
participants with proper conceptual and methodological skills
for working in the new international environment which is shaped,
to a large extent, by information technology.
<P>
The Course is divided into the following three areas:
<OL>
<LI>New political, social and economic environment for diplomatic
activities;
<LI>New topics on diplomatic agendas;
<LI>New tools for diplomats.
</OL>

<P>
<I>1</I><HR>

<P>
<I><B>NEW POLITICAL, SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT FOR DIPLOMATIC
ACTIVITIES</B></I>
<P>
The development of  IT  has made the modern world increasingly
interdependent and interconnected. Today's trends and characteristics,
which are likely to endure, will bring about deep changes of economic,
political and social structures in nation states as well as in
international relations.  The impact of these changes on diplomacy
is in the focus of this part of the Course.
<P>
<I>IT AND CHANGES IN MODERN SOCIETY</I>
<P>
The key question:<I><B> How will IT affect the way people live,
work and learn?</B></I>
<P>
Diplomats should have an understanding of the profound changes
in the production processes, and social structure. They  should
also be aware of conceptual  frameworks and tools for  the analysis
of the modern world. These issues are analyzed in proper economic,
political, philosophical and sociological perspectives. The main
schools of thought explaining these phenomenon is presented and
reviewed.
<P>
<I>IT AND SOVEREIGNTY</I>
<P>
The key question: <I><B>To  what extent will the development of
IT  affect the ability of states to assert their sovereignty in
the international arena and over their national destiny? </B>
</I>
<P>
Diplomacy is directly affected by the changes in the concept of
sovereignty. One of the main function of traditional diplomacy
has been to protect the sovereignty of states. Is this going to
remain the main function of diplomacy? Given that sovereignty,
the key element of state, has been seriously challenged by modern
processes, it is necessary to provide diplomats with a general
understanding of these processes as well as of the future of diplomacy
in new constellation of power. 
<P>
<I>2</I><HR>

<P>
<I>IT AND INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS (CONCEPT OF POWER</I><B>)</B>
<P>
The key question: <I><B>Is it likely that &quot;provinces&quot;
and &quot;backwaters&quot; in the forthcoming period will not
be countries with geographical disadvantages, but countries without
access to the networks, or, for instance, with IT-illiterate elites?
</B></I> 
<P>
Professional education of diplomats and foreign-policy decision
makers has been based on the traditional approaches to international
relations (e.g. realist and idealist). The main purpose of this
module of the Course is to provide some alternative approaches
and to bring the diplomats' attention to new perspectives of analyzing
international relations.  Special emphasis is paid to the importance
of geographical elements  in international relations.  It is likely
that the predominant determinant of a country's economic and overall
success is, among others, the skills in managing information and
data instead of controlling territory or important geographical
locations like it used to be during the history of mankind.<B>
</B>
<P>
<I>IT AND CULTURAL DIVERSITY</I>
<P>
The key question: <I><B>How will the growing movement of information
in digital form across national borders affect cultural, religious
and other values. Is Huntington's clash of civilization going
to happen in cyber-space? What should be the function of diplomacy
in this respect?</B></I>
<P>
Artifacts in digital form imposes a new form of communication
between individuals within the society as well as between societies.
IT will endanger traditional means for protection and promotion
of national culture and, at the same time, create new ones. The
special importance to this question is in multi-cultural societies
and regions (the Mediterranean), where the issue of the protection
of national cultures has a high political importance.
<P>
<I>3</I><HR>

<P>
<I>IT AND INTERNATIONAL ECONOMY</I>
<P>
<I>The key question</I>:  <I><B>How will the transition from a
commerce/industry economy towards an &quot;information economy&quot;
influence the diplomats'  task to promote the economic interests
of their countries?</B></I>
<P>
Classical economic theory and practice was build upon commerce/industry
economy. &quot;Information economy&quot; will require a new theoretical
and practical framework The features of this new framework are
in the focus of  this part of our Course. 
<P>
<I><B>NEW TOPICS ON DIPLOMATIC AGENDAS</B></I>
<P>
The growing centrality of IT-issues in international relations
has raised new and complex topics for diplomats and foreign policymakers.
Information Technology, which already takes a huge share of economic
transactions, requires proper international legal and political
framework.  Creating this framework, both on bilateral and multilateral
level, is one of the major tasks of diplomats.  In order to perform
this important function, diplomats should have a broad knowledge
of the various aspects of IT-related issues from a technological,
economic and legal point of view.
<P>
<I>IT COMMODITIES AND SERVICES</I>
<P>
The key question: <I><B>What are the most important IT commodities
and services? What are their major characteristics?</B></I>
<P>
The major aim of this part of the Course is to provide the basic
knowledge of IT commodities and services with special emphasize
on those that have or will have high importance in international
trade. The brief survey of major IT commodities and services is
provided, with special consideration of the protection of software.
 As far as software is concerned the special attention is paid
on various components of the protection of software such as: source
code, operation systems, compilers, executable elements of software,
etc.
<P>
<I>INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS, FORUMS AND CHANNELS FOR REGULATION
IT-RELATED ISSUES</I>
<P>
The key question: <I><B>What are the major international organizations,
forums and channels for discussing and regulating IT-related issues?
</B></I>
<P>
This part focuses on  international institutional framework for
regulating IT-issues. The survey will start with the established
international organizations and forums such as International Telecommunication
UNION (ITU), The World Telecommunication Forum, International
Standard Organization (ISO), American National Standards Institute
(ANSI), European Computer Manufacturers' Association (ECMA), etc.
It will also consider existence of the number of important NGOs,
such as  Electronic Frontier Foundation.
<P>
<I>TRANSFER OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY</I>
<P>
The key question<B>:</B><I> What are the various channels for
the transfer of IT from developed to developing countries?</I>
<P>
Transfer of technology, including IT, is one of the core topics
of the modern international economy. It has special importance
for north-south relations, development, etc. The major task of
this part of Course is to make a survey on the current policy
of transfer of technology and to identify all those aspect which
have a special importance for diplomacy and international relations.
Special emphasize is given to GATT activities and the newly-established
 WTO (World Trade Organization).
<P>
<I>PROTECTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IN BILATERAL </I>
<P>
<I>RELATIONS (SPECIAL EMPHASIS ON SOFTWARE)</I>
<P>
The key question: <I><B>What are the methods used for the protection
of software in bilateral relations between states? </B></I>
<P>
Analysis of the current practice of the United States and other
developed countries in this respect is provided. Special emphasis
is placed  on the position of developing countries in their attempts
with developed countries to enable bilateral protection of software.
 The problem of linking bilateral protection of software to the
transfer of technology is also addressed
<P>
<I>PROTECTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IN MULTILATERAL </I>
<P>
<I>CONTEXT (SPECIAL EMPHASIS ON SOFTWARE)</I>
<P>
The key question: <I><B>What are the safeguards used for the protection
of software in the available multilateral mechanisms (e.g. GATT,
World Intellectual Property Organization, EU, etc.). </B></I>
<P>
The Uruguay Round of GATT and  the formation of the World Trade
Organization is taken as a case study on multilateral protection
of software.  Positions of developed and developing countries
with regards to the protection of intellectual property is tackled
with special considerations on the  pros and cons for certain
forms of protection of intellectual property.
<P>
<I>OTHER  INTERNATIONAL LEGAL AND POLITICAL TOPICS RAISED BY THE
DEVELOPMENT OF IT</I>
<P>
Besides  the above mentioned topics the development of IT will
bring a number of a new issues that should be tackled on the international
level (e.g. transboundary disputes related to IT, protection of
privacy, limiting of free communication in the interest of international
public order, etc. )
<P>
<I>7</I><HR>

<P>
<I><B>NEW TOOLS FOR DIPLOMATIC ACTIVITIES</B></I>
<P>
Today, computers are more widely available to a large community
of users due to its lower cost. In diplomatic circles, the use
of computers was the privilege of the most developed countries.
Now, the use of computers in diplomacy can be afforded by any
country. Moreover, small States and other countries with limited
economic means for running their foreign affairs will find computers
a real necessity.
<P>
This part of the Course considers the practical use of computers
in conducting diplomatic activities. It focuses on  the use of
computer technology for:
<UL>
<LI>the automation of traditional methods of performing diplomatic
functions; and
<LI>re-engineering of diplomatic procedures.

<P>
<I><B>RESEARCH ON DIPLOMACY AND INFORMATION</B></I>
<P>
<I><B>TECHNOLOGY</B></I>
<P>
Research projects  are directed towards exploring the dynamic
interaction between diplomacy and IT. They are interlinked with
the Course in Diplomacy and IT and developing applications for
diplomacy. The major focus in this period is on the following
two research projects:
<P>
<I>CREATING THE MODEL FOR THE COMPUTERISATION OF MINISTRIES OF
FOREIGN AFFAIRS</I>
<P>
The Model of the Computerization of Ministries of Foreign Affairs
is based on the analysis of diplomatic activities and their adaptation
to information technology. The  knowledge and experience developed
for business information systems are suited  to the needs of diplomatic
activities. Model focuses on:
<UL>
<LI>the automation of traditional methods of performing diplomatic
functions; and
<LI>the re-engineering of traditional diplomatic procedures when
it is possible. 
</UL>

<P>

<P>
Major parts of this Model are:
<UL>
<LI>automation of routine and repetitive activities
<LI>supply of data and information
<LI>automation of knowledge-intensive activities; and
<LI>human resource building
</UL>

<P>

<P>
The Model provides a general framework that could be  adjusted
to the particular needs of Ministries of Foreign Affairs and other
institutions involved in performing diplomatic activities.
<P>
<I>THE IMPACT OF TECHNOLOGY ON INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS</I>
<P>
This research project which is still in initial phase should tackle
the following issues:
<UL>
<LI>the increasing integration and disintegration of the international
system - a highly paradoxical environment
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>the impact of information technology and real-time access
to information on the international system;
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>the increased importance of networking netweing for new systems
of governance
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>the emergence of a new moral order from the transcendence
of the environment-development paradox
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>integration theory and neo-functionalism as a theoretical
framework for analysing the role of networks in international
relations.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
<I>PART III</I>
<P>
<I><B>APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT AND ELECTRONIC PUBLISHING FOR DIPLOMACY
</B></I>
<P>
One of the major objectives of the Unit for Computer Applications
in Diplomacy is to create tools that will help diplomats in their
training and performing diplomatic functions. Based on these starting
points the Unit developed the following applications:
<P>
<I>DATABASE OF INTERNATIONAL LAW</I>
<P>
The main motto in creating this database has been the need to
have a complete coverage of international legal rules, starting
from their adoption on the international level to their implementation
in relations among/between states or within states. Thus each
international legal instrument (convention, treaty) in the Database
has:
<UL>
<LI>basic information (title, date of acceptance, place of acceptance,
etc.);
<LI>full text;
<LI>list of countries that signed and/or ratified particular instrument
with texts of reservations, declarations, notifications, etc.;
<LI>indication of implementation of the instrument within the
internal legal system (solutions for both, monistic and dualistic
legal systems);
<LI>theoretical explanations for political and legal concepts
used in instruments;
</UL>

<P>

<P>
Technically speaking this application uses database and hypertext
technology. The current version of Database has 2000 international
legal instruments.<HR>

<P>
<I>15</I><HR>

<P>
<I>COMPUTER-ASSISTED LEARNING (CAL) COURSE IN DIPLOMACY </I>
<P>
CAL Course in Diplomacy is developed in order to support the teaching
of Diplomacy at the Mediterranean Academy of Diplomatic Studies.
It uses hypermedia technology for presenting teaching material.
 This application will be further developed in order to become
a self-contained Computer-based course in Diplomacy.
<P>
<I>COMPUTER-ASSISTED LEARNING (CAL) COURSE IN DIPLOMACY &amp;
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY</I>
<P>
It is considered appropriate to have the Course on Diplomacy and
IT taught by using new tools made available by IT. Consequently
the application for the support of this course has been developed.

<H5><I>THURSDAY, MAY 21st</I></H5>

<H4><B>OPENING SESSION</B></H4>

<P>
<I>Paper of Professor David Attard: &quot;Environmental Protection
of Areas beyond national jurisdiction: Proposal for international
action&quot;</I>
<P>
<B>Chair</B>: Professor Kappeler
<P>
Professor Attard, in his capacity of convenor, expressed his thanks
to the participants and his conviction that this Colloquium would
help in drawing attention to the environment issues beyond national
jurisdiction.
<P>
Professor Attard then read his paper:<HR>

<H4><B>ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION OF AREAS BEYOND NATIONAL JURISDICTION:
A PROPOSAL FOR INTERNATIONAL ACTION</B></H4>
<HR>

<H5><B>Introduction</B></H5>

<P>
The urge to improve the human condition coupled with rapid population
growth and the remarkable technological developments risks upsetting
the global environmental balance upon which, to a greater or lesser
degree, all life depends. Unless timely action is taken, the generations
of the next century - just over 2,500 days away - may inherit
a planet wherein even the very existence of life will be threatened.
In the face of this grave danger, it is not difficult to understand
that environmental protection has become one of the main concerns
of the international community.
<P>
Whilst considerable international action has been taken, or is
under way, there is a major deficiency in this process which has
to be remedied if the battle against environmental degradation
is to succeed. It is useless to improve the environment in areas
falling under national jurisdiction if the so called &quot;commons&quot;,
or, more precisely, areas beyond national jurisdiction (hereafter
referred to as &quot;Extra-Territorial Spaces&quot;) remain inadequately
protected.
<P>
Efforts to protect the environment deal mainly with activities
occurring in areas within State jurisdiction. This is understandable,
particularly as: (i) until recently, a large number of environmentally
harmful activities occurred mainly within States' territories;
and (ii) affective enforcement jurisdiction has traditionally
belonged to States. The absence of an effective international
institutional authority has further encouraged this tendency.
<H5><B>The Problem</B></H5>

<P>
Increasingly, however, it is becoming evident that environmental
damage caused to Extra-Territorial Spaces is a common concern
not just of a State or group of States, but of mankind as a whole.
Activities which cause damage to these spaces may cause prejudice
either to States or the international community as a whole. Polluting
activities occurring in Extra-territorial Spaces could easily
affect areas falling under the national jurisdiction of a State
or States. Even when this occurrence does not take place, it is
still reasonable to argue that such activities may cause harm
which could adversely affect the interest of the international
community as a whole in the said spaces.
<P>
Consequently, improved environmental protection within national
boundaries may eventually prove to be inadequate unless Extra-Territorial
Spaces are subject to effective environmental control. Furthermore,
it is no longer reasonable to argue that any State or entity that
pollutes Extra-Territorial Spaces should not be held accountable
to the international community. The traditional freedom of access
to these spaces and their uses has too often been translated into
freedom to pollute.
<P>
Given the increasing demands of mankind and its rapidly developing
technologies, the areas of common use can no longer be considered
vast enough to accommodate all human uses and needs. The current
state of the High Seas, regulated by the freedom of the seas regime,
demonstrates that intensive shipping, large-scale dumping, greater
resource exploitation and insensitive onshore developments are
threatening to disrupt the delicate ecological balance of this
immense space which covers over 45% of the globe's surface.
<H5><B>Extra-territorial spaces</B></H5>

<P>
There is no general widespread agreement as to which areas can
be characterized as Extra-Territorial Spaces. The area known as
the High Seas, its superjacent air-space, and the international
sea-bed area, are generally considered to be Extra-Territorial
Spaces. More controversial has been the status of Antarctica,
certain parts of the atmosphere, celestial bodies and the geosynchronous
orbits. There are also problems with respect to establishing the
exact geographical extent of these spaces. The extent of the High
Seas, for example, depends largely upon the maritime claims of
coastal States.
<H5><B>International law</B></H5>

<P>
It would be folly if the international community, in its efforts
to develop an effective international environmental law, failed
to fully recognize that the legal regimes regulating mankind's
use of Extra-Territorial Spaces provide inadequate comprehensive
environmental protection. Despite the interdependence of these
Spaces, the said regimes do not reflect this relationship. Furthermore,
even the most evolved - that of the High Seas - is unsatisfactory.
The development of freedom of the High Seas was largely based
on the premise that man could not cause serious, irreparable environmental
damage due to the vastness of oceans in the face of the relatively
limited human uses thereof. The validity of this premise is today
no longer tenable.
<P>
The environmental balance of the High Seas is in danger of being
irreparably upset due to activities ranging from the continuous
disposal of radioactive wastes (adding to the existing radiation
caused by nuclear weapons testing) to oil pollution (some 1.5
million tons of oil are spilled annually). Even the 1982 Convention
on the Law of the Sea does not contain effective institutional
or legal measures to ensure the effective and comprehensive environmental
protection of the High Seas. In fact, the Convention sets up an
institutional framework which is largely concerned with the sea-bed,
ocean floor and subsoil thereof, beyond the limits of national
jurisdiction. Article 135 states that the legal status of the
superjacent waters and air space remain unaffected. Despite some
innovations found in the environmental provisions of the Convention,
the envisaged protection of the High Seas remains insufficient.
<P>
A similar, if not greater, inadequacy exists with respect to the
regulation of other Extra-Territorial Spaces. On the other hand,
it would not be reasonable to deny that some progress has been
made. Reference, for example, can be made to the series of IMO
Conventions, the Outer Space Treaties, the Antarctica Treaties,
the 1963 Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, the 1976 Environmental Modification
Convention, and the 1985 Ozone Layer Convention and its related
1987 Protocol. Neither should the conclusion of these treaties
be overestimated for they raise innumerable social, economic,
political and technical differences.
<P>
Furthermore, this process deals with the problem in a fragmentary
manner often producing haphazard, piecemeal and disconnected measures.
This approach contradicts the interdependence which exists between
Extra-Territorial Spaces. Any response of the international community
to protect these spaces in the interests of present and future
generations must take into account this intimate relationship
and must be global in scope.
<P>
Finally, in considering regimes to protect the environment of
Extra-Territorial Spaces it is particularly important to remember
that a delicate balance has to be struck &quot;between regulating
activities too late and regulating non-existent activities too
soon&quot;. Thus, for example, it does not seem unreasonable to
seek to regulate the use of nuclear materials in outer space,
and the disposal of
<P>
space debris in the region between 160 and 1760 kilometres above
Earth. Similarly, space industry's plans to establish a lunar
colony for 12 astronauts by 2005 to exploit lunar resources for
oxygen, energy and building materials may require more immediate
attention and possible amendments to the Outer Space Treaties.
On the other hand, action with respect to the proposed manned
flight to Mars by 2010 would seem, at least at this stage, premature.
<H5><B>Proposed action</B></H5>

<P>
The magnitude and complexity of the problem calls for immediate
action of a global scale. It is proposed that the United Nations
is the proper forum wherein such action can be planned.
<P>
In this respect, it is suggested that the UN Secretary-General
should be requested - as a first step - to establish (through
the Executive Director of UNEP) a Group of Eminent Persons to
prepare a study which would <I>inter alia</I> make recommendations
with respect to the identification and extent of Extra-Territorial
Spaces, the environmental state of such spaces, the rights and
duties of States and the international community therein, possible
strengthening of relevant existing instruments, and make proposals
on how the effective environmental protection of such spaces can
be best achieved. <HR>

<B>Subject</B>: Spaces Beyond National Jurisdiction
<P>
Professor Kappeler presents the following paper:<A NAME="intro1">
</A><HR>

<H3><B>WHICH ARE THE SPACES BEYOND NATIONAL JURISDICTION?</B>
</H3>

<H4><B>Introduction</B></H4>

<P>
The expression &quot;spaces beyond the limits of State jurisdiction&quot;
appears to imply that there is a clear limit to spaces under State
jurisdiction. This, increasingly, is no longer the case. States
exercise residual jurisdiction beyond the limits of spaces traditionally
attributed to them, and they continue to exercise jurisdiction
over objects and human beings in spaces beyond their jurisdiction
as a result of which their responsibility may be engaged by incidents
caused by such objects or human beings. Conversely, their jurisdiction
over spaces traditionally attributed to them is increasingly restricted
by rules of international law. Moreover, the physical limits of
the spaces under State jurisdiction are often in doubt, or there
are different limits for different aspects of State jurisdiction.
<P>
Before considering the spaces which essentially escape State jurisdiction,
we would thus like to briefly consider the limits of spaces traditionally
under the jurisdiction of individual States.
<H4><B>The physical limits of State jurisdiction</B></H4>

<P>
States exercise their jurisdiction over their territory which
comprises land, inland waters and, in most cases, a stretch of
territorial sea, as well as over the air space covering this land
and waters. On land and inland waters, borders delimit the jurisdiction
of one State with regard to that of others. This may also be true
on sea, as regards the jurisdiction over territorial waters of
geographically adjacent States as well as where the sea space
separating two States is so narrow as not to exceed the width
of their combined territorial waters.
<P>
Where a State faces a wider sea space the limits of its jurisdiction
are gradual. Full jurisdiction ends at the outer limit of territorial
waters<A HREF="#footnotes" >(1) </A><B>.</B> Residual jurisdiction
ends for the most part at the outer limit of the contiguous zone
<A HREF="#footnotes" >(2) </A>. However a few elements of jurisdiction
remain up to the outer limits of the exclusive economic zone<A HREF="#footnotes" >(3)  
</A>. Finally, where the continental shelf<A HREF="#footnotes" >(4)  
</A>extends beyond the limits of the exclusive economic zone of
the waters covering it, the coastal State retains jurisdiction
over that shelf in spite of the fact that the waters covering
this part are definitely beyond such jurisdiction.
<P>
The limits of the air space over a State's territory and territorial
waters with respect to outer space are in dispute<A HREF="#footnotes" >(5)  
</A>. Several theories have been advanced in this regard and,
for the purposes of codification of law, arbitrary limits have
been proposed by some but rejected by others. This means that
for different purposes the upper limit of a given State's air
space may be set at different altitudes. As regards air space
over seas beyond the outer limits of the territorial waters, it
is no longer under the jurisdiction of the coastal State<A HREF="#footnotes" >(6)  
</A>.
<H4><B>The Antarctic Continent<A HREF="#footnotes" >(7) </A></B>
</H4>

<P>
Over time many States have claimed slices of Antarctica. Such
claims are however frozen as long as the Antarctica Treaty of
1959 remains in force. As a result the legal regime of the Antarctic
Continent is determined by international law and State jurisdiction,
as far as it is allowed to exist, is determined and limited by
that law.
<P>
Most legal norms governing Antarctica are found in the Treaty
itself and in the growing number of secondary texts adopted pursuant
to it. The current list of legal texts governing Antarctica is
as follows:
<P>
- Antarctic Treaty or 1959
<P>
- Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals, 1972
<P>
- Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources,
1980
<P>
- Convention on the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resource Activities,
1988
<P>
- Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty,
1991, with annexes<A HREF="#footnotes" >(8) </A>
<P>
As can be seen from the above, the legal regime of Antarctica
extends beyond its land mass and covers a sizeable expanse of
the waters surrounding it, at least as far as protection of living
resources and the environment is concerned.
<H4><B>The Arctic Ocean<A HREF="#footnotes" >(9) </A></B></H4>

<P>
Not so long ago, this region was governed only by the international
law of the sea. However, the fact that large parts are covered
with more or less permanent ice and the discovery that, like the
Antarctic Continent, this maritime region plays a fundamental
role in the ecological equilibrium of the world, have led to the
adoption of special rules by coastal States surrounding the Arctic
Ocean and joint endeavours to further develop the nascent specific
legal regime. Besides a number of bilateral treaties dealing with
specific parts of the Ocean such as the Barents Sea and the and
the Spitsbergen (Svalbard) Archipelago<A HREF="#footnotes" >(10)  
</A><B>,</B> representatives of Arctic countries have met since
1989 to review the problems of the region and the possibilities
and means of dealing with them. In June 1991 they adopted a lengthy
document known as Arctic Environmental Protection Strategy<A HREF="#footnotes" >(11)  
</A>.
<H4><B>The High Seas<A HREF="#footnotes" >(12) </A></B></H4>

<P>
Until the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea becomes legally
binding on most maritime nations as a result of its entering into
force with regard to them, or until such time as its essential
provisions have become universal customary law, both the delimitation
and the regime of the high seas are in a state of confusion and
controversy. For the moment, only the four conventions
<P>
adopted in Geneva provide rules accepted by a seizable number
of maritime countries:
<P>
- Convention on the Territorial Sea and Contiguous Zone
<P>
- Convention on the High Seas
<P>
- Convention on Fishing and Conservation of the Living Resources
of the High Seas
<P>
- Convention on the Continental Shelf
<P>
Otherwise the only rules that are generally applicable are those
of traditional customary international law, and these mainly provide
for more or less unlimited freedom. There are of course conventions
on fishing and the protection of certain species as well as regarding
marine pollution which have been widely accepted by maritime nations
and thus provide a more acceptable legal regime in the fields
they cover:
<P>
- International Convention on the Regulation of Whaling, 1946
<P>
- International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution of
the Sea by Oil, 1954
<P>
- Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapons Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer
Space and under Water, 1963
<P>
- International Convention Relating to Intervention on the High
Seas in Case of Oil Pollution Casualties, 1969
<P>
- International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution
Damage, 1969
<P>
- Treaty on the Prohibition of the Emplacement of Nuclear Weapons
and Other Weapons of Mass Destruction on the Seabed and Ocean
Floor and in the Subsoil Thereof, 1971
<P>
- Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping
of Wastes and Other Matter, 1972
<P>
- International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from
Ships, 1973, amended in 1978
<P>
As for the air space covering the seas beyond the territorial
waters of coastal States<A HREF="#footnotes" >(13) </A>, the main
concern of legal regimes adopted so far is aviation. Only recently
have efforts been initiated to deal with the protection of this
part of the globe's air space against pollution and other undesirable
immissions. In particular, efforts to protect the ozone layer
and to prevent global warming and other forms of climate change
affect air space over the seas as much as national air spaces.
<H4><B>Outer Space<A HREF="#footnotes" >(14) </A></B></H4>

<P>
This part of the universe became relevant in legal terms only
since humanity developed the means of entering it with technical
devices and even vessels carrying human beings. As far as the
Earth's environment is concerned, only a tiny segment of outer
space can be affected by human technology. But that part, because
it interacts with the atmosphere and the Earth's surface itself,
is of course of greatest importance for the future of our globe
and its inhabitants.
<P>
Legal norms governing outer space seek to remove it and the natural
objects it contains from any attempts at accaparation by individual
States or groups of States while at the same time preventing States
from using those regions for military purposes or polluting them
with man-made objects sent into it. In both these latter regards,
international efforts so far have only been partly successful.
The main legal texts are:
<P>
- Declaration of Legal Principles Governing the Activities of
States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, 1962
<P>
- Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the
Exploration and Use of Outer Space, Including the Moon and Other
Celestial Bodies, 1967
<P>
- Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space
Objects, 1976
<P>
- Agreement Governing the Activities of States on the Moon and
Other Celestial Bodies, 1979
<H4><B>The relevance of regimes as regards environmental protection
</B></H4>

<P>
In the case of the arctic and antarctic regions, regimes already
set up or in the making will probably allow for comprehensive
systems to regulate the protection of the local environment. However,
because these regions are very much affected by what happens elsewhere,
in particular in the seas, in the air and in outer space, the
effectiveness of such overall regulatory systems is dependent
on how environmental problems are handled in other parts of the
world.
<P>
As regards these other parts, the absence of generally applicable
legal norms seems to militate in favour of the punctual approach
followed so far. Specific aspects of environmental protection
and rehabilitation must be tackled in such a manner that rules
adopted also apply to terrestrial and celestial spaces beyond
State jurisdiction or regarding which the existence and extent
of State jurisdiction is in doubt or a subject of controversy.
Another approach which has proved useful in the past and merits
to be pursued in the future is the regional approach<A HREF="#footnotes" >(15)  
</A>. The Mediterranean is a good example in this regard<A HREF="#footnotes" >(16)  
</A>.
<P>
Its coastal States have come to realise that survival of the Sea
itself as a living entity is only possible if they act in concert,
irrespective of political, economic and military conflicts which
otherwise may divide them. One must hope that this Colloquium
will help to add new impetus to efforts currently under way to
further strengthen and develop measures to safeguard and even
rehabilitate the Mediterranean Sea. Success achieved in a geographically
limited area may also become a stimulant for similar efforts elsewhere
and even at the global level.<A NAME="discus1"></A><HR>

<H3><B>DISCUSSION</B></H3>

<P>
<B>Mr. Micallef</B> noted that scholars, lawyers and diplomats
can not work credibly if they are ignorant of how their national
government and administration function.
<P>
<B>Professor Serracino Inglott</B> asked Professor Attard whether
it would not be better to adopt a general regime of the atmosphere
as in the case of the Law of the Sea rather than a convention
on climate change alone.
<P>
<B>Professor Attard </B>agreed that a general regime should be
the objective. In Ottawa there was however a lot of hostility
to such a venture, whereas there existed some feeling of urgency
with regard to the need to protect the climate worldwide. What
was unusual in the proceedings was that the UN imposed a deadline
for the completion of a draft as a reflection of the urgency of
the situation. Existing sectorial regimes however already contain
some elements for an overall regime to be adopted later. One should
also note that the draft convention on climate change mostly contains
principles which will have to be implemented by more detailed
rules to figure in protocols.
<P>
<B>Professor Birnie</B> wondered whether one should be talking
about boundaries at all. She suggested discussion of regimes rather
than areas. She disagreed with Prof. Kappeler's statement that
boundaries are not properly defined in law as there is a lot of
solid customary law in this field.
<P>
<B>Dr. Keckes</B> agreed that one should not concentrate on the
definitions of boundaries but more on the regulating activities.
Even the Mediterranean Action Plan found it impossible to define
the limits of its spatial scope.
<P>
<B>Dr. Raftopoulos</B> felt that this is not a question of technicality
but responsibility. In environmental matters one should stress
the functional aspects of international law.
<P>
<B>Professor Birnie</B> also disagreed with the idea that only
pollution matters in extraterritorial spaces. Due attention must
be given to living resources.
<P>
<B>Dr. Simone Borg</B> noted that international law is still too
immature not to consider boundaries in diplomacy. We have to deal
with sovereign States and boundaries are needed to delimit areas
of jurisdiction.
<P>
<B>Professor Serracino Inglott</B> reminded the participants that
the sovereignty concept is not part of the essence of international
law. In medieval times it hardly played a role.
<P>
<B>Dr. Mifsud</B> pointed out that there are other impacts on
extra-territorial and faraway areas than pollution of air and
water. Certain technologies can unleash hurricanes over great
distances and also cause floods.
<P>
<B>Dr. Raftopoulos</B> agreed with Professor Serracino Inglott
that the concept of sovereignty was unknown to the founders of
international law.
<P>
<B>Professor Attard</B> said that he could sympathise with the
diplomat's dilemma of having to respect sovereignty while dealing
with problems transgressing this concept. This is why he had suggested
to consider the climate a common concern of mankind, as a means
to overcome the sovereignty impasse. This was largely accepted.
<P>
<B>Professor Kappeler </B>concluded that whereas problems, concern
and solutions to be sought as regards the preservation of the
environment are universal, yet those who have to deal with them
are States still attached to their sovereignty. As their responsibility
may be engaged for areas under their control, the delimitation
of the latter remains necessary.<A NAME="footnotes"></A><HR>

is no longer carried by the too rarefied air or the point where
orbiting satellites are slowed down by the resistance of air particles.
Modern space technology which has produced spacecraft that can
also be used as aircraft (like the space shuttle) makes such criteria
difficult to apply. Arbitrary limits of 100 and 300 km have also
been postulated. Matters are further complicated by the claim
of equatorial countries to the space segment in which geostationary
satellites can be stationed.

<LI><A HREF="#intro2" >Degradation and Remedies to it  </A>:-
Paper of John C. Pernetta: &quot;Environmental degradation of
spaces beyond the limits of national jurisdiction: scientific
and management considerations&quot;

<P>
<B>Chair</B>: Dr. Boldirev
<P>
<B>Subject</B>: Scientific Aspects of Environmental Degradation
and Remedies to it
<P>
The chairman singled out the following key points to be considered
from a scientific perspective:
<OL>
<LI>What is degradation? How should one define it? For example
there are some views that climate changes do not necessarily cause
a degradation of the environment.
<LI>How do we learn about changes likely to produce a degradation
of the environment?
<LI>How can degradation be measured?
</OL>

<P>
The attempt to answer these questions raises the problem of certainty
in science that has important implications on legal administrative
and political fields.
<P>
Dr. Pernetta at the request of the Chair, made some preliminary
remarks which he later consolidated in the following study:<A NAME="intro2">
</A><HR>

<H3><B>ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION OF SPACES BEYOND THE LIMITS OF
NATIONAL JURISDICTION: SCIENTIFIC AND MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS
</B></H3>

<H4><B>Introduction<A HREF="#endnotes" >(1) </A></B></H4>

<P>
This paper considers only the scientific and managerial aspects
of environmental degradation of the oceans and atmosphere (including
the troposphere). Issues relating to inner and outer space beyond
the limits of the atmosphere, and space &quot;litter&quot; are
not discussed. The particular environmental problems of the Antarctic
Continent which is subject to special
<P>
treaty arrangements and where territorial claims are currently
suspended under the present Antarctic Treaty, are also excluded
from this brief overview.
<P>
At the outset it is worth noting that from a scientific or environmental
perspective the limits of national jurisdiction are artificial
boundaries which in most cases have no environmental reality.
Regulation of human activities and environmental management actions
therefore take place within a framework based on social, legal
and cultural systems which have been generally developed for purposes
other than protection of the environment and maintenance of natural
productivity.
<P>
The failure of management units to follow natural system boundaries
leads to difficulties of sustainable use and maintenance of environmental
quality. In addition legal boundaries are normally static, derived
from some spatially fixed point or recognisable, agreed baseline,
whereas environmental boundaries are generally dynamic, changing
on diurnal, seasonal, annual and longer term bases. Anthropogenic
activities in one compartment of the biosphere can and do have
impacts and consequences at considerable distance from their sources;
due in part at least to natural cycles, such as the hydrological
cycle; and processes, both physical, such as basin scale ocean
currents, and biological, such as long distance migration.
<P>
It is important to recognise in the first instance that all living
organisms affect their physical surroundings, and indeed that
the first photosynthetic organisms to appear on earth had a major
effect both on the composition of the atmosphere and the chemistry
of the oceans (Siever, 1975). Pre-life atmosphere was dominated
by water, methane and ammonia; both oxygen and tropospheric ozone
were absent. The emergence of simple photosynthetic organisms
around a billion years ago, resulted in production of atmospheric
oxygen which, by the beginning of the palaeozoic era 600 million
years ago, was at sufficiently high concentrations to permit the
evolution of consumer organisms, which fed upon the autotrophic
photosynthesing organisms. On much shorter time scales the actions
of animals affect the rate and direction of plant succession and
hence the characteristic vegetation of an area.
<P>
Changes to the vegetation in turn affect the cycling of water
and nutrients and the rate of soil formation and loss through
erosion and transport to the marine environment.
<P>
It should come as no surprise therefore that a species as abundant
and widespread as humanity impacts the environment resulting in
physical and biological changes to the world's ecosystems and
global processes. A priori one should have anticipated this. Whilst
the scale of human impacts may now appear obvious, particularly
in the light of present ideas concerning global climate change
and ozone depletion, such a possibility received little attention
in the last century when Arrhenius first postulated the idea that
man might have an effect on global climate. The relatively recent
acceptance of this idea that the scale of human-induced changes
could affect global processes and systems, reflects the rapid
improvement in scientific knowledge and the recent development
of tools and technologies which enable us to measure different
kinds of environmental change.
<H4><B>Environmental Degradation: Causes and Effects</B></H4>

<P>
In general the sources of environmental degradation of spaces
beyond the limits of national jurisdiction result from:
<P>
- Landbased activities occurring within national jurisdiction;
<P>
- Maritime and aerial transport activities;
<P>
- Living marine resource exploitation;
<P>
- Offshore mineral exploration and exploitation;
<P>
- Marine dumping and incineration.
<P>
These result in:
<P>
- Contamination and pollution;
<P>
- Changes in atmospheric composition and chemistry;
<P>
- Changes in ocean chemistry;
<P>
- Marine resource depletion;
<P>
- Global climate change and sea level rise.
<H4><B>The Atmosphere</B></H4>

<P>
Sources of change
<P>
Changes in atmospheric composition result from a variety of human,
landbased activities. Agriculture increases atmospheric methane
concentrations both from paddy rice and stock production. Global
estimates of the rate of increase in atmospheric methane demonstrate
a clear relationship with increasing human populations (UNEP,
1987). Forest clearance for alternate land use reduces the biomass
sink of carbon dioxide and if accompanied by burning results in
increased flux of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere.
<P>
Agrochemicals including both pesticides and fertilisers, applied
in intensive agriculture may enter the atmosphere and be transported
over considerable distances prior to subsequent degradation and/or
deposition on land or in the ocean. Through the processes of leaching
and runoff such chemicals may also enter the coastal ocean, ultimately
finding their way into water masses beyond the exclusive economic
zones of the originating State.
<P>
Industrial development results in an increased rate of consumption
of fossil fuels and hence an increased rate of carbon dioxide
production into the atmosphere. In addition industries create
a wide variety of atmospheric pollutant gases such as sulphur
dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrous oxide and xenobiotic gases such
as chlorofluorocarbons together with fine particulate matter and
aerosols of varying chemical composition and toxicity.
<P>
Pathways
<P>
Whilst many of the gaseous contaminants and pollutants entering
the atmosphere have a short lifespan, being quickly dissolved
in water droplets and subsequently deposited on land or ocean,
others may have long residence times in the atmosphere, causing
changes to its overall gaseous composition and chemistry. In general
shortlived contaminants have greater impacts
<P>
within the areas of national jurisdiction, whilst longerlived
contaminants can and do impact environmental spaces beyond the
limits of national jurisdiction.
<P>
Contaminants can travel in the atmosphere either as gases or as
aerosol particles; phosphorus and all trace metals except mercury
travel in association with aerosol particles while fixed organic
nitrogen can travel as gases or as aerosols. Generally contaminant
substances are injected into the atmosphere at or near the surface
of the earth, are mixed vertically and transported hundreds to
thousands of kilometres from the site of emission. Because most
sources are generally in northern midlatitudes, most transport
is from west to east with North America contributing to the north
Atlantic and the Asian areas contributing to the North Pacific.
In the trade wind zones however transport may be from East to
West, resulting in for example transport of contaminants from
Latin America across the Pacific towards Hawaii.
<P>
The state of the atmosphere
<P>
There can be no dispute that the gaseous composition of the atmosphere
is changing, with measurable increases in radiatively active gases
such as carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and chlorofluorocarbons
(Siegenthaler &amp; Sanhueza, 1991). Tropospheric ozone is continuing
to decrease in concentration, and these changes are observable
throughout the atmosphere. The concentration of shortlived atmospheric
contaminants and pollutants is highly variable from region to
region.
<P>
The issues of transboundary air pollution are addressed within
the context of a number of regional conventions and international
declarations. The issues of widespread changes to atmospheric
quality in terms of ozone depletion and greenhouse gas buildup
are addressed through the Vienna Convention, the Montreal Protocol
and the Climate Convention. By and large the wording of these
conventions is related solely to controlling the effects of one
State's actions or omissions on the areas under the jurisdiction
of another State.
<P>
The protection of the environmental quality of spaces outside
national jurisdiction is by and large not directly addressed in
the context of international legal agreements. Where the state
of extranational environments is addressed in the context of international
agreements, consideration is limited to human use and enjoyment
of such space and the possible consequences of human-induced changes
to such use and enjoyment.
<H4><B>The Ocean</B></H4>

<P>
Contaminants and pollutants enter the ocean via leaching, runoff
and discharge from land, via dumping and incineration, maritime
transport and offshore production and via the atmosphere (44%;
10%; 12%; 1%; &amp; 33% respectively; GESAMP, 1990).
<P>
Not all landbased sources of change in the ocean fit a strict
definition of contamination or pollution, since human activities
may merely increase the rate of natural processes such as erosion.
It is interesting to note in this regard that human landbased
activities such as forest clearance, overgrazing, mining and construction
have dramatically increased the flux of sediments to the ocean.
It has been estimated that human induced changes have resulted
in a doubling of sediment inputs into the coastal ocean since
the industrial revolution. Such a change is measurable in geological
terms. More recently widespread dam construction for hydropower
and freshwater management has had the reverse effect, reducing
sediment and nutrient inputs to coastal waters and resulting in
the collapse of fisheries such as the sardine fishery off the
Nile Delta in the Mediterranean.
<P>
Landbased sources of marine pollution
<P>
The most recent GESAMP report on the State of the Marine Environment
(GESAMP, 1990) states that dissolved nutrient fluxes in rivers
resulting from human activities are at least comparable to and
probably significantly larger than the natural fluxes (15, 1,
&amp; 100 Mt yr1 for nitrogen, phosphorus and silicon respectively).
The bulk of these are removed or retained within
<P>
estuarine and continental shelf areas under national jurisdiction
and in the case of nitrogen and phosphorus only an estimated 0.44
and 0.3 Mt yr are thought to enter the open ocean. Estimates of
trace metal contaminants entering the open ocean are variable,
depending upon the database and the method of estimation employed,
while global estimates of synthetic organic compounds are not
possible due to the complex chemistry of the substances involved
and their heterogeneous distribution.
<P>
Atmospheric pathways of marine pollution
<P>
Sources of atmospheric trace metals include natural and manmade
inputs and both global and regional estimates of emissions are
available (Pacnya, 1986). Atmospheric fluxes of trace metals to
the ocean vary regionally, depending on proximity to continental
sources, with the North Sea and Mediterranean generally displaying
the highest values and the tropical South Pacific the lowest.
In the case of mercury there is little regional variation since
mercury is transported in the gaseous phase as opposed to aerosol
particles. Organic substances of concern include pesticides and
Polychlorinated Biphenols (PCB's) and polyaromatic hydrocarbons
(PAH's). In the latter case no reliable global estimates are available.
<P>
Comparison of atmospheric and riverine inputs of pollutants
<P>
The relative importance of the two possible routes for contaminant
and pollutants entering the marine environment varies considerably
from region to region, and for many regions data are not available.
However available information suggests that river inputs are generally
more important in areas of the ocean under national jurisdiction
whilst atmospheric inputs are more important in open ocean areas.
In the case of the North Atlantic and North Sea however it would
appear that atmospheric inputs of lead, zinc and cadmium substantially
exceed those of rivers. In the case of nutrients such as nitrogen
most of the river based inputs are trapped within the coastal
zone resulting in atmospheric inputs of nitrogen to the open ocean
dominating. In contrast riverine inputs of phosphorous are more
important than atmospheric sources.
<P>
Marine based sources of pollution
<P>
Marine based sources of pollution associated with international
shipping, maritime transport and offshore mineral production have
generally declined over the last two decades although accidents
involving oil well blowouts and tanker spillages may have major
impacts locally. In general marine based sources of pollution
have their greatest impacts in coastal waters under national jurisdiction,
although oil slicks and plastic litter are found in all major
sea lanes and ocean incineration and dumping continue in some
areas.
<P>
Exploitation of marine resources
<P>
Changes to the marine environment have resulted from the use of
marine species largely for human and animal feedstuff. It has
been estimated by FAO (1985) that around 75% of all marine resources
are taken from within 9 Kilometres of the shore, and that the
present yield of around 100 million metric tonnes per annum represents
the maximum sustainable yield from presently exploited global
fisheries resources. It is further estimated that by the year
2000 the total increase in demand for fisheries products will
equal around an additional 20 Million metric tonnes annually.
To-date the impacts of harvesting marine resources have therefore
been felt in areas under national jurisdiction, and include overexploitation,
habitat degradation and changes to species composition.
<P>
Although the existence of unexploited stocks is probably limited,
the possibility that technologies will be developed for exploiting
bathypelagic fish stocks and mesopelagic stocks of squid must
be considered. In addition stocks of nontraditional species such
as krill, may be exploited at much higher levels in the future
for animal feed. Such stocks are by and large found in areas of
the open ocean outside national jurisdiction. Current open ocean
fisheries involve exploiting shallow swimming transboundary and
migratory species such as the pelagic tunas. The use of environmentally
damaging technologies, such as the massive drift nets employed
by Asian longdistance fishing fleets in the Pacific, is a cause
of particular concern to small coastal and archipelagic States
for whom such resources represent one of the major if not the
sole source of development income.
<P>
State of the open ocean
<P>
The 1989 GESAMP report on the State of the Marine Environment
states:
<P>
1. In 1989 man's fingerprint is found everywhere in the Oceans.
Chemical contamination and litter can be observed from the poles
to the tropics and from beaches to abyssal depths. But conditions
in the marine environment vary widely.
<P>
2. The open sea is still relatively clean. Low levels of lead,
synthetic organic compounds and artificial radionuclides, though
widely detectable, are biologically insignificant. Oil slicks
and litter are common along sea-lanes, but are, at present, of
minor consequence to communities of organisms living in openocean
waters.&quot; (Executive summary, GESAMP, 1990).
<P>
It further suggests that no area or resource has yet been irrevocably
damaged or destroyed and that in the immediate future increasing
rates of environmental degradation might be expected to occur
primarily within the coastal zones; that is areas within national
jurisdiction. It might be inferred from the above discussion,
however that degradation of the environmental quality of ocean
areas beyond national jurisdiction will follow as a logical consequence
of dispersal and movement of contaminants and pollutants from
coastal to off shore waters; and as a consequence of rapid industrialisation
and development increasing the flux of airborne contaminants.
<P>
Threats posed by climate change and ozone depletion
<P>
In terms of general marine productivity open ocean areas are the
watery equivalent of deserts and most marine productivity is centred
in zones of upwelling where cold nutrient rich water is brought
to the surface and in coastal zones where nutrient inputs from
landbased sources are high. The overall impact of reduction in
the marine primary productivity of open ocean areas as a consequence
of increased UV radiation is likely to be small and of greater
concern are potential impacts in the more productive coastal areas,
at high latitudes.
<P>
The relationship between changes in major ocean circulation and
current patterns and the distribution and productivity of many
stocks of marine resources is well known and demonstrated as in
the case of the Japanese sardine fishery associated with the Kyushu
current and the Peruvian anchovetta fishery associated with the
Humboldt current (Kawasaki, 1991). In the latter case the pelagic
fishery collapses during El Nino years when warm surface water
from the western Pacific dominates the offshore areas (Escobar,
et al., 1988). Quite apart from the impacts that changes to global
air temperature may have on weather and climate, changes to ocean
surface water temperatures are likely to have major consequences
for the distribution and abundance of marine organisms including
planktonic species. Changes in species composition are likely
to occur at all levels of the food chain; the magnitude and duration
of primary production in temperate and higher latitude ocean areas
can be expected to change; and, spring peaks of production may
occur earlier in the year.
<P>
Such examples suggest the changes to major ocean currents and
oceanic primary productivity, which might arise as a consequence
of global warming and could affect the distribution and abundance
of marine resources in the open ocean. It is virtually impossible
to predict with any certainty, the scale and magnitude of such
impacts at the present time.
<P>
Scientific uncertainty
<P>
Although it is now possible to identify many of the point sources
of emission or discharge and the nature of pollutants and contaminants
entering the oceans and atmosphere considerable scientific uncertainty
continues to surround the fate and flux of such materials. In
addition the identification of diffuse sources of contaminants
and pollutants, or those which disperse widely through the atmosphere
or ocean is difficult and often such sources cannot be positively
pinpointed. Although the impacts, both potential and actual of
certain contaminants can be predicted with some accuracy, in the
case of others risk assessments and potential impacts are less
certain. The impacts of global climate change and ozone depletion
on environmental quality and the productivity of natural environments
outside national jurisdiction are as yet unclear.
<P>
In part this uncertainty reflects inadequate knowledge and understanding
of the foodwebs and natural productivity of marine systems, particularly
those occurring at depth, and in part uncertainties surrounding
the actual magnitude and extent of predicted changes in physical
variables such as water temperatures and ocean current patterns.
In addition recruitment rates of currently exploited stocks of
pelagic fish, their standing stocks, turnover-times and present
harvest rates are not sufficiently well quantified to permit accurate
modelling and prediction of sustainable yields.
<P>
For planning and management purposes science is expected to produce
accurate, precise and detailed statements in answer to questions
of what if ... ? Such an expectation on the part of decision-makers
is unrealistic at the present time and would require considerable
investment in data collection, modelling and analysis. It is imperative
therefore that any management regime, whether national, regional
or international take adequate account of existing scientific
uncertainties.
<P>
In the early days of the application of Environmental Impact Assessments
for example, the stance of the developer was often based on the
attitude &quot;the environmental scientist must prove that impacts
will occur before we concede the need for action&quot;. In general
the position of environmental science confronted with the need
to make predictions is well summarised by Jackson (1982) in writing
about the impacts of a major copper mine development in New Guinea
who states:
<P>
But the facts available are very few, casting perhaps as much
light as might a crescent moon on a man searching a medicine cabinet
full of poison for an aspirin to relieve a worrisome headache
....... the experts, if they are honest, will be keeping their
fingers crossed and their environmental monitoning systems under
constant scrutiny.
<P>
Increasing recognition of scientific uncertainties not only surrounding
global issues such as climate change impacts, but single development
activities involving resource exploitation has lead increasingly
to the adoption of a
<P>
precautionary approach. This approach assumes that where impacts
are likely to occur mitigatory measures should be adopted. This
approach differs significantly from the initial approach of industry
to EIAs outlined above; the onus is now on the developer or potential
polluter to prove that impacts will not occur.
<H4><B>Scientifically based management systems</B></H4>

<P>
Modern environmental science has its roots in the scientific discipline
of ecology whose most prominent founding exponent, Charles Elton,
recognised the vital imperative of understanding the linkages
between physical, and biological processes in shaping the environment
(Elton, 1927). The approaches of the science of ecology are essentially
holistic, a recognition that the sum of natural systems is greater
than the sum of their component parts. In concentrating on what
one might call human ecology, environmental science has lost this
holistic view, the environment is seen as the product of human
interaction with natural systems, and yet humanity is not seen
as being both dependent on, and an integral part of, the system
itself. Indeed the very concepts of sustainable use, wise management,
and integrated environmental management imply that humanity &quot;controls&quot;
what happens to environments rather than recognising that human
actions &quot;affect&quot; environments and vice versa.
<P>
The inability of science to accurately model and predict future
changes to natural and manmade systems with any degree of certainty
means that in reality we can neither, manage nor control environments
as environments, but only manage and control human actions which
we know will result in some impact on the physical and biological
surroundings. The limits to these effects both in spatial and
temporal terms are thus vitally important components of any management
system.
<P>
It is possible within the biosphere to recognise boundaries and
edges between different systems. Within the boundaries of any
one system energy and matter flow and circulate, whilst considerably
less energy and matter are exchanged across the boundaries of
such ecosystems. Human actions inside such a
<P>
system, whether these involve producing pollutants, changing habitats
or exploiting a natural resource will therefore have greater impacts
within the system than on neighbouring systems.
<P>
Ideally therefore scientifically based environmental management
systems must adopt two basic philosophical approaches:
<P>
a) Holistic (sometimes inaccurately referred to as integrated)
approaches to managing, controlling and regulating all human activities
simultaneously;
<P>
b) Recognition of environmental limits and boundaries in time
and space; and consequent adoption of management units which correspond
as closely as possible to &quot;real&quot; environmental units.
<P>
Implications for future management of areas beyond the limits
of national jurisdiction
<P>
It is important to recognise that existing national and internationally
agreed boundaries generally do not correspond to the boundaries
of environmental units (see p 190 In Elder &amp; Pernetta, 1991).
Thus the areas of the open ocean beyond the 200 mile exclusive
economic zones have no real integrity as functioning environmental
systems. Migratory stocks of important fish routinely move between
areas of the high seas and areas under national jurisdiction,
whilst pollutants and contaminants are transported and mixed by
atmospheric and ocean processes which are determined by factors
such as physical topography and climate.
<P>
Most boundaries adopted for legal purposes at all levels are the
result of historical, social, cultural and other human factors,
and the consequences for environmental protection and management
are frequently disastrous. The failure of countries in the GangesBrahmaputra
catchment to jointly regulate and manage their use of the watershed
and freshwater resources has profound consequences for downstream
neighbours and illustrates the problems of
<P>
reconciling environmental management with existing legal regimes
and national interests even within small regional and subregional
areas.
<P>
Often transboundary and migratory stocks are subject to exploitation
not only within a number of EEZ's but by distant water fishing
fleets. Whilst regional fisheries bodies attempt to advise governments
on the rates of sustainable harvest they have no power to enforce
exploitation rates and not all States involved in a fishery are
necessarily part of the regional fisheries body. Sustainable management
of such stocks is only possible when all parties involved in the
exploitation of such stocks cooperate in pooling data relating
to the stock itself and in determining total harvest limits and
their allocation between users.
<P>
It is salutary to realise that most individual States are incapable
at the present time of integrating their management and use of
environments and resources over which they have sole jurisdiction.
Many of the current widespread environmental problems of coastal
zones result directly from the sectoral approaches to development
and use which have been applied in the past. As noted elsewhere
(Pernetta, &amp; Elder, in press) such approaches work, only when
one use does not conflict with another. As human populations grow,
and resource consumption increases the potential and actual conflicts
between competing sectoral interests within States result in accelerating
rates of degradation. Although the need for integrated coastal
zone management is widely recognised internationally, no country
has successfully implemented such a programme to date. This does
not augur well for international management of spaces outside
national jurisdiction.
<P>
Whilst some international agreements and declarations attempt
to control the actions and omissions of one State which affect
neighbouring States, their effectiveness is limited. Legal mechanisms
including laws, conventions, protocols and other tools for regulating
actions can only function when the parties to the instrument agree
on the principles which form the basis for the agreement. This
viewpoint contrasts sharply with that of science. The view of
science is that facts are facts and that predictions can only
be made with a certain level of probability. The level of scientific
certainty depending on the nature of the available data and the
models, it is normal for scientists to
<P>
disagree on the consequences of particular courses of action.
Indeed agreement is rare and at least in environmental science
is normally based on the absence of evidence to refute a view
or theory rather than on the existence of absolute proof that
the theory is indeed correct.
<P>
Despite assertions to the contrary, there is not an &quot;international
scientific consensus&quot; that global warming will actually occur.
There are significant dissenters from this view and it is perhaps
salutary to remember that following the cooling which occurred
in the sixties scientific attention was directed towards the possibilities
of the next ice age rather than towards the prospects of a warmer
world. What currently exists is a majority opinion that warming
will occur and although the differences between these two expressions
might appear slight and semantic they are nevertheless significant
in terms of planning and management. Consensus implies the absence
of any possible alternative future whilst majority opinion implies
that real alternatives exist which must also be taken into account.
<H4><B>Conclusions</B></H4>

<P>
Despite the various scientific uncertainties action must be taken
in the face of global changes which are to some extent predictable:
including growing human populations; industrialisation and development;
and increasing consumption of the limited resource base of the
world. All too often the scientific uncertainties are used as
a basis for not agreeing to the principles, or as a basis for
failing to take action. Regrettable as it is, science does not
operate on the basis of consensus, hence there exists a need to
integrate the development of consensus based international legal
regimes with the probabilistic approaches of environmental science.
<P>
In the case of ocean and atmospheric spaces beyond national jurisdiction
it is possible to clearly and definitively state that changes
will occur in these areas as a consequence of growing human populations
and increasing consumption of natural resources. An ultimate precautionary
approach would be to take action designed to limit both the magnitude
and the direction of such changes despite our inability to predict
the impacts and consequences which such
<P>
changes might have on the environmental quality and productivity
of such areas.
<P>
Such actions should include:
<P>
a) The minimisation of waste emissions and discharge;
<P>
b) Storage and retention of waste emissions and discharges within
the environmental compartment or system in which they are produced;
<P>
c) Restriction of human activities which increase the natural
flux of materials and energy between environmental units (e.g.
land to sea);
<P>
d) Development of appropriate management systems and regimes for
resources currently or potentially exploited in extranational
spaces; and,
<P>
e) Integrated planning of sectoral use of environments and resources.
<HR>

<H3><B><A NAME="disco2"></A>DISCUSSION</B></H3>

<P>
<B>Dr. Boldirev</B> opened the discussion saying that scientists
should give initial signals for legal action which should result
in international regulations. He emphasised the problem of adequacy
of information and knowledge for successful actions. As regards
the relations between scientific and policy spheres, he mentioned
the additional difficulty that politicians demand to have precise
options, among which they can make a choice. From the scientific
point of view this is difficult to achieve.
<P>
<B>Professor Kappeler</B> stressed the problem of clear definition
of degradation. He said that it will be necessary to distinguish
evolution and normal processes from degradation. There is also
an interaction between the problems and attempts at remedying
them. Sometimes the solution adopted produces worse effects than
the problem itself. There is an need for constant dialogue between
science and law if one is to avoid shortcomings based on lack
of coordination.
<P>
<B>Mr. Micallef </B>said that the quality of legal rules is a
necessary but not sufficient condition for effective action. Bottlenecks
delaying environmental action are very often found at the administrative
level in States. Without effective administrative implementation
at national level many valid ideas and international legal instruments
become ineffectual. For example, although the Mediterranean Action
Plan (MAP) is considered a model of regional action by UNEP, there
are a lot of difficulties as regards its implementation due to
a lack of efficient action within member States. This is often
due to the absence of means for enforcement at both national and
regional levels.
<P>
<B>Dr. Spiteri </B>noted the usefulness of environmental auditing,
especially if done jointly by lawyers and scientists.
<P>
<B>Dr. Keckes</B> said that the problem of implementation is real.
The Barcelona Convention for example does not provide for effective
mechanisms of control and implementation. Mostly it relies on
voluntary implementation. To some extent this is due to the fact
that sovereignty-conscious States were pushed by
<P>
popular pressure to adopt regimes that do not reflect political
and economic realities. Moreover poor countries were sometimes
persuaded to accept a regime by the promise of financial assistance,
which then failed to materialise.
<P>
<B>Dr. Raftopoulos</B> confirmed that the Barcelona Convention
only requires reporting. Contributions to the trust fund might
be a means of enforcement, but this is prevented by the permissive
language used. Nevertheless the Convention anticipates the holistic
approach now favoured by stressing the mobility of boundaries.
<P>
<B>Professor Birnie</B> noted tendencies in the regional treaties
not to use enforcement mechanisms provided for by international
law. Parties are invited to &quot;take necessary measures&quot;.
Such tendencies reflect the need to accommodate many divergent
interests. On the other hand, newer regimes provide scientific
criteria for measuring their implementation and for serving as
basis for national rules to be enacted. The Convention on the
Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) unfortunately does not provide for mutual
inspection by the parties as do earlier more specific regimes.
More prominence should be given to the cautionary principle which
aims at preventing damage rather than providing remedies when
it already has happened.
<P>
<B>Dr. Mallia </B>deplored the absence of commonly agreed definitions
of what constitutes pollution and degradation and of minimum standards
for environmental protection at national level. Degradation of
the environment should be seen as a threat rather than an impediment
to development, although this is sometimes disputed. International
agencies often compete with one another rather than cooperating
in search of a joint approach.
<P>
<B>Ms. Spiteri</B> noted that the situation has improved thanks
to the availability of new technological tools such as computers
and observation satellites. This particularly applies to extra-territorial
spaces. Computer technology can improve the exchange of information.
<P>
<B>Dr. Keckes </B>said that lack of information is no longer a
problem. What is often missing is the political will at State
level to take appropriate action. Lack of cooperation and competition
between international agencies and institutions is mostly due
to competition among State agencies which send out conflicting
signals.
<P>
<B>Mr. Micallef </B>also agreed that there is no lack of knowledge.
What is missing is coordinated action at national levels, based
on cooperation of all concerned agencies.
<P>
<B>Professor Attard</B> said that there is indeed a proliferation
of treaties without effective implementation. Partly this is the
result of a lack of follow-up processes, including monitoring
systems at national and international levels. There is an important
role for science in creating such systems. Diplomats make treaties,
scientists should monitor their implementation. On the other hand,
the accumulation of declarations and resolutions constitutes a
type of international pressure that may produce action. Diplomats
should be backed by adequate environmental knowledge. UNITAR is
currently considering means of training diplomats in environmental
negotiations.
<P>
<B>Dr. Raftopoulos</B> said that vagueness of treaty provisions
reflects the need to accommodate divergent interests. It is necessary
to use a step-by-step approach, beginning with the establishment
of a global framework based on consensus. Thereafter concrete
measures of implementation, entailing strict legal obligations
can be adopted by way of protocols. Such an approach was adopted
in the case of the Barcelona Convention.
<P>
<B>Dr. Pernetta</B> noted that there area often misunderstandings
as regards scientific data. There is not a lack of information
but often the impossibility of any valid prediction that could
be derived from it. The concept of degradation implies a value
judgement which makes a scientific definition impossible.
<P>
Summing up the discussion, <B>Dr.Boldirev</B> noted the following:
<P>
1. Changes in extra-territorial spaces have occurred and can be
measured. Thus a monitoring system that would estimate what has
happened and what might happen is possible;
<P>
2. In dealing with environmental matters, a holistic approach
is needed, involving all disciplines;
<P>
3. Recommendations for national and international actions should
be worked out with those who will have to implement them;
<P>
4. Science cannot always identify who is responsible for a given
development. More reliance should therefore be put on damage prevention

<P>
<B>Subject</B>: Scientific aspects of environmental degradation
and remedies to it: consideration of specific issues<A NAME="intro3">
</A><HR>

<P>
The Chairman opened the discussions by identifying four issues
for consideration:
<P>
1. The Open Sea
<P>
2. The Mediterranean
<P>
3. Climate as a global concern
<P>
4. Biodiversity
<P>
How much do we know about environmental state? What kind of recommendations
could be made for governments to establish international policies?
<A NAME="disco3"></A><HR>

<H3><B>DISCUSSION</B></H3>

<P>
<B>Professor Kappeler</B> asked whether the scarcity of fish on
the high seas as described by Dr. Pernetta in the morning also
applies in the Mediterranean.
<P>
<B>Professor Attard</B> wanted to know which are the primary sources
of pollution of the high seas from the atmosphere.
<P>
<B>Dr. Pernetta </B>answered that 33% of the pollution of the
high seas comes from the atmosphere, which acts as vehicle of
pollutants produced on land. Pollutants carried by the atmosphere
are aerosols and gases. Aerosols are dropped close to coastal
areas whereas gases can be transported over vast distances. Aerosols
consitute the bulk of pollutants which means that coastal
<P>
waters are more affected than high seas. As regards fishing, the
high seas can be considered the equivalent of deserts on land.
Lack of proper nutrients does not allow important fish populations
to exist.
<P>
<B>Dr. Keckes </B>added that the fisheries situation in the Mediterranean
is the same as worldwide. In addition there is a great difference
between northern and southern shores of that sea. The latter are
nearly devoid of prosperous fishing grounds. Most of the species
are currently overfished, so that depletion is a distinct menace.
<P>
<B>Mr. Micallef</B> noted that as far as pollution with heavy
metals is concerned, studies show that in the Mediterranean these
are carried mostly through the atmosphere. Land-based sources
of such pollutants have been identified.
<P>
<B>Dr. Keckes </B>explained that present models do not allow for
proper identification of the sources of pollutants carried by
air. A great part is likely to originate from distant hinterlands,
especially from northern Europe.
<P>
<B>Dr. Boldirev</B> wondered whether, in view of the modest living
resources of the high seas and of the fact that most airborne
pollutants do not reach them, there is much urgency in adopting
a legal regime for them.
<P>
<B>Professor Attard</B> pointed out that, as no country in the
Mediterranean has yet declared an exclusive economic zone, national
jurisdiction effectively ends at the limit of their contiguous
zone. This leaves a much larger proportion of high seas than on
the oceans.
<P>
<B>Dr. Boldirev</B> concluded from what had just been said that
the Mediterranean is more polluted than the oceans and that a
large proportion of its fishing areas are still beyond national
jurisdiction.
<P>
<B>Dr. Keckes </B>explained that the Mediterranean could be considered
as a small model for the oceans. Most fish caught are migratory
species whose spawning grounds are far removed from where it is
caught and lie mostly within areas of national jurisdiction (fishing
zones). Those spawning grounds therefore need international protection.
<P>
<B>Dr. Mallia</B> wondered whether the Black Sea should be considered
as part of the Mediterranean. She also drew attention to proposals
to tax tourists in order to raise funds for protecting the marine
environment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Micallef</B> reminded participants that the Mediterranean
represents less than 1% of the global maritime surface. As there
is very little exchange of waters with the Atlantic, anything
that happens within the Mediterranean remains there for a long
time. Sometimes phenomena do occur that attract the attention
of all Mediterranean States like the 1983/4 jellyfish invasion,
whose origin was never fully determined. It is however likely
that it lies in areas beyond national jurisdiction.
<P>
<B>Professor Kappeler</B> asked for information regarding the
importance of absorption of carbon gas by the oceans.
<P>
<B>Dr. Boldirev </B>replied that absorption capacity increases
with lower temperatures. It is estimated that about 50% of man-made
CO2 emitted into the atmosphere is absorbed by the oceans. This
might change with higher temperatures. The impact and final fate
of absorbed CO2 in the oceans is not yet known. This whole issue
underlines the importance of a holistic approach to environmental
phenomena and their consequences.
<P>
<B>Professor Attard</B> said that the IOC draft did not consider
CO2 absorption by the oceans because of the complexity of the
issue but instead only considered the impact of deforestation
on atmospheric CO2 content.
<P>
<B>Dr. Boldirev</B> noted that a warming of ocean temperature
could modify currents along the South American coasts to the detriment
of the hinterland. This should draw the attention of Amazonian
countries to the interest of stopping deforestation.
<P>
<B>Dr. Boldirev</B> as Chairman summed up the discussion by noting
that data gathered often create a need for more studies, observations
and research. It is important that responding to this need be
done in common by all concerned.<HR>

<P>
In a few days time, the international community will be gathering
in Rio de Janeiro to take crucial decisions on two important area
relating to the wellbeing of our planet Earth and to our societies.
The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED),
to be held in Brazil from the 3rd to 15th June 1992, will be the
climax of a process which began in December 1989 by the adoptive
of resolution 44/228 by the Session of the United Nations General
Assembly. The main objective of the conference is to take steps
to reverse trends and establish the basis for a sustainable way
of life on the planet as we move into the 21st century.
<P>
It will be an exercise in international diplomacy to review the
overall situation of the environment and its interrelationship
with development already recognized twenty years ago at the United
Nations Conference on the Human Environment, heId in Stockholm,
Sweden, in 1972. Fifteen years later in 1987, in its report &quot;Our
Common Future&quot;, the World Commission in Environment and Development
concluded that &quot;environment&quot; and &quot;development&quot;
must be integrated to achieve &quot;sustainable development&quot;
which &quot;meets the needs of the present without compromising
the ability of future generations to meet their own needs&quot;.
<P>
UNCED, or the Earth Summit as it is now called, will hopefuIIy
bring to a conclusion a threeyear exercise on a number of issues,
mapping out a strategy with builtin mechanisms to address the
degradation of and threats to the environment and create a more
balanced and equitable sustainable development.
<P>
Among the issues which the Earth Summit will address are:
<P>
protection of the atmosphere (climate change, depletion of the
ozone layer, transboundary air pollution);
<P>
protection of land resources (combating deforestation, soil loss,
desertification and drought);
<P>
protection of freshwater resources;
<P>
protection of oceans, seas and coastal areas, and the rational
use and development of their living resources;
<P>
environmentally sound management of biotechnology and hazardous
wastes (including toxic chemicals);
<P>
prevention of illegal traffic in toxic products and wastes;
<P>
improvement in the quality of life and human health; and
<P>
improvement in living and working conditions of the poor by eradicating
poverty and stopping environmental degradation.
<P>
The Rio Conference will also consider the underling patterns which
cause stress to the environment, addressing issues like poverty
in developing countries, levels of economic growth, unsustainable
patterns of consumption, demographic pressures and the impact
of the international economy.
<P>
The Conference is expected to adopt:
<P>
the Rio Declaration that will embody basic principles that must
govern the economic and environmental behaviour of peoples and
nations to ensure &quot;our common future&quot;;
<P>
Agenda 21, a blueprint for action in all major areas affecting
the relationship between the environment and the economy, focusing
on the period up to the year 2000 and extending into the 21st
century;
<P>
the means to carry out the Agenda by making available to developing
countries the additional financial resources and environmentally
sound technologies they require to participate fully in global
environmental cooperation and to integrate environmental considerations
into development policies and practices;
<P>
agreement on strengthening institutions in order to implement
these measures; and
<P>
a Framework Convention on Climate Change. a Convention on Biological
Diversity and a Convention on Forestry
<P>
But you may ask, why have I introduced my intervention by giving
prominence to the forthcoming Rio Conference. The answer is simple.
For Malta, the agenda of the Conference presents a challenge,
a vision for the future, a compliment to the initiatives taken
by Malta at the United Nations in the protection and conservation
of the environment, that which represents today the fundamental
concept of the &quot;common good&quot;, which in the words of
the Maltese Prime Minister &quot;was traditionally considered
the object of political activity for the individual State, (and)
should now be seen to be and become the good of all human kind.&quot;
<P>
It was precisely on this concept that already twentyfive wears
ago, Malta introduced the concept of the Common Heritage of Mankind
to the international seabed and ocean floor and the subsoil thereof,
underlying the high seas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction,
and that this area would be used exclusively for peaceful purposes
and its resources would be used for the common benefit of all
mankind. The adoption of the U.N. Convention on
<P>
the Law of the See in 1982, heralded the first allencompassing
international legal regime that brought together, in an unprecedented
achievement, ideals for the conservation of the environment with
those of &quot;equitable and economic development.&quot;
<P>
In 1988, another concept was launched by Malta and accepted by
the community of nations in the UN General Assembly resolution
43/53. I am referring to the Common Concern of Mankind attributed
to Climate Change. This in turn started a process that will reach
its climax at the Rio Conference by the adoption of a Framework
Convention on Climate Change that will serve to protect global
climate for present and future generations of humankind.
<P>
A year later, Malta submitted for the consideration of the 44th
Session of the United Nations General Assembly yet another environmental
issue on the &quot;Protection of ExtraTerritorial Spaces for Present
and Future Generations&quot;. Malta's request to establish a Group
of Eminent Persons to prepare a study on this problem did not
attract sufficient attention and it was decided to adjourn the
debate on this issue. However, I am glad to point out that the
International Law Commission has taken up the matter in its consideration
of the topic &quot;International liability for injurious consequences
arising out of acts not prohibited by international law&quot;.
<P>
Professor Guido de Marco, in his capacity as the President of
the 45th Session of the General Assembly, put forward a proposal
whereby the United Nations Trusteeship Council would be given
an additional function under the United Nations Charter to hold
in trust for humanity its common heritage and its common concerns:
the environment, the protection of the extraterritorial zones,
the resources of the sea and of the seabed, the climate and the
rights of future generations.
<P>
The proposal to give additional functions to the UN Trusteeship
Council would create a complementing mechanism that would strengthen
and manage those parts of the planet that fall outside notional
jurisdiction &quot;through international cooperation and agreed
regimes for surveiIIance, development and management in the common
interest.&quot;
<P>
The ongoing discussions on environment and development should
make us pause and take a closer look at the two initiatives launched
by Malta on the protection of extraterritorial zones and the UN
Trusteeship Council which in my view merit further consideration,
perhaps even suggesting what action con be taken to promote them
further.
<H4><B>Extraterritorial spaces </B></H4>

<P>
On 24 July 1989, following a Cabinet decision to accept a proposal
put foreword by Professor David Attard, Malta, through its Permanent
Representative to the United Nations, on 11th August 1989, addressed
a letter to the SecretaryGeneral of the United Nations requesting
the inclusion in the provisional agenda of the 44th Session of
the General Assembly under item 83, entitled &quot;Development
and international economic cooperation&quot;, of a supplementary
subitem entitled &quot;Environmental protection of extraterritorial
spaces for present and future generations&quot; in the agenda
of the 44th session of the General Assembly.
<P>
In an explanatory memorandum annexed to the proposal, Doc. A/44/193
dated 17th August 1989, Malta spelled out the rationale for the
effective and comprehensive environmental protection of extraterritorial
spaces, such as the high seas, which Malta viewed as vital to
safeguard the global environment. The memorandum went on to explain
that &quot;the human urge to improve, coupled with increased population
growth, and the remarkable developments in technology may cause
substantial, irreparable environmental harm to an increasing number
of 'extraterritorial spaces'. This harm, to a greater or lesser
extent, would adversely affect all States and would prejudice
the interests which the international community as a whole may
have in the said spaces.&quot;
<P>
In view of the magnitude and complexity of the issue, the Government
of Malta, proposed that the 44th Session of the General Assembly
&quot;should request the SecretaryGeneral to establish, through
the Executive Director of UNEP, a group of eminent persons to
prepare or study, which would,
<P>
interalia, make recommendations with respect to the identification
and extent of 'extraterritorial spaces,' the state of the environment
in such spaces, the rights and duties of States and the international
community therein, and possible strengthening of relevant existing
legal instruments, and which would make proposals on how the effective
and comprehensive environmental protection of such space can be
best achieved&quot;.
<P>
On 14th September 1989, the Prime Minister of Malta wrote a letter
to a number of eminent persons requesting their personal support
in order to ensure the smooth passage of this proposal. On his
letter, the Prime Minister highlighted the fact that &quot;it
is pointless to protect the environment in areas that fall within
notional jurisdiction, but, at the same time, neglect the environmental
integrity of the ExtraTerritorial Spaces. The current state of
the High Seas, for example, demonstrates that this ExtraTerritorial
Space con no longer continue to safely accommodate all human needs
and uses. There is also the question of interdependence between
the various ExtraTerritorial Spaces.
<P>
Letters were sent. among others to, President Mugabe of Zimbabwe.
Prime Minister Lubbers of the Netherlands, Prime Minister Brundtland
of Norway, Prime Minister Rocard of France, Prime Minister Gandhi
of India. President Mubarak of Egypt and Prime Minister Mulroney
of Canada.
<P>
The Executive Director of UNEP, Dr. Mostafa Tolba, characterized
the proposal as &quot;'timely and necessary&quot; and encouraged
the Government of Malta to put forward its proposal.
<P>
The former United Nations SecretaryGeneral, Javier Perez de Cuellar,
in a letter to the Prime Minister of Malta, stated that the proposal
clearly indicated that &quot;this is an area which deserves serious
attention.&quot; He also paid tribute to the Government of Malta
for the forwardlooking approaches which it continued to take with
regard to environmental issues that are of such major concern
to the international community as a whole.
<P>
On 20th September 1989, the General Committee of the General Assembly
approved the inclusion of the item 43 part of the Agenda of the
Assembly, allocating the discussion and consideration of the issue
to its Second (Economic) Committee.
<P>
Immediately afterwards, intensive informal consultations began
on a draft text of a resolution based primarily on the points
contained in the Explanatory Memorandum presented previously.
<P>
The initial reactions to the draft were not encouraging, and as
had happened on many other instances at the United Nations, questions
were raised as to how much the proposal was valid or whether such
an initiative cost money or whether it infringed on the sovereignty
of a State. It was therefore of no surprise that Malta's proposal
did not receive that enthusiastic support which it merited even
though many others recognized that the problem did exist. After
all one still remembers the air of initial scepticism and uncertainties
that surrounded the initiatives introduced by Malta on the Law
of the Sea and on Climate Change.
<P>
During the informal consultations concerns were expressed on the
definition of the phrase 'extraterritorial spaces' as according
to certain delegations this was a completely new terminology and
because it was used in reference to a concept that was not fully
understood. Others questioned the appropriateness for the setting
up of an Eminent Persons Group, the difficulty in defining its
terms of reference and the fact that such a Group would have entered
into uncharted or sensitive and controversial waters (such as
Antarctica). The point was also made that already too many activities
and initiatives relating to the environment were being undertaken
and therefore some questioned whether the time was opportune to
open up in a new direction.
<P>
The Maltese Delegation, taking into account most of the points
raised, formally submitted to the Secretariat on 15 November 1989,
a revised draft resolution which was circulated under the reference
A/C.2/44/L.41. The Maldives, Mali, Vanuatu, Paraguay and Togo,
joined as cosponsors of the draft resolution.
<P>
The draft resolution was formally introduced in the Second Committee
of the General Assembly on 20 November 1989, after which it was
examined in informal consultations in one of the Working Groups
of the Committee chaired by one of its ViceChairmen.
<P>
Very extensive and elaborous consultations were held which could
not be concluded because of the limited time available and when
it seemed thus some form of a consensus could be reached, the
process was suspended.
<P>
The reactions following the decision not to press for action highlighted
the complexity of this topic. The consultations held helped delegations
to be enlightened in their thinking on this topic which deserved
all that attention. France, on behalf of the European Community,
stated that although the time was not ripe, the initiative was
useful and could be raised later.
<P>
In its decision 44/51, the General Assembly on the recommendation
of the Second Committee, decided to take no action on the draft
resolution &quot;at the present time&quot; thus leaving the door
open for further consideration of the Maltese initiative.
<P>
In retrospect, one can realize the difficulties faced by a number
of delegations to come to grips with the portent of the Maltese
proposal. Precisely because of the concerns raised and the questions
made that the proposal could have been addressed if the draft
text of the resolution had been successfully negotiated and adopted
giving the mandate to an eminent person group to study the matter.
<P>
The failure of the General Assembly to adapt a text on this important
subject, was fortunately enough mitigated by an important development
in the International Low Commission and in the Preparatory Committee
for UNCED.
<P>
The International Law Commission, for some time now, has been
exploring the possibility of extending the topic of liability
for acts not prohibited by international law to harm caused to
the socalled &quot;global commons&quot;. The
<P>
Special Rapporteur, Prof. Julio Barboza, in his sixth report contained
in document A/CN.4/428/Add.1, deals extensively and in detail
on the liability for harm to the environment in areas beyond national
jurisdiction that which Malta has described in its proposal to
the United Nations cis &quot;extraterritorial spaces&quot;.
<P>
Prof. Barboza's report unequivocally ascertains that &quot;we
have now reached the point where cumulative effects, on the one
hand, and major accidents, on the other, are causing harm to the
environment which is having and appreciable (significant) impact
on States, their nationals and their property&quot;. The report
continues that &quot;'the effects usually are not concentrated
in one place: they are dispersed by water or aircurrent and disappear
into the vastness of the seas or the atmosphere. The harm is intangible
for now potentially threatening, and no longer just for the environment
but also for mankind itself.
<P>
It is of great satisfaction to note that the International Law
Commission's recommendation that this question be put on its agenda
has been endorsed by the 46th Session of the General Assembly.
<P>
Yet another development which has to be recorded here, is the
text that is being considered for discussion at UNCED relating
to the sustainable use and conservation of the high seas living
resources. This proposal, if adopted, would promote rules for
management and conservation of the marine living resources on
the high seas so as not to cause damage to the living resources
within the 200mile limit of national jurisdiction of coastal States.
<H4><B>The U.N. Trusteeship Council</B></H4>

<P>
The evolvement of the environmental protection of our planet and
the fact that &quot;the atmosphere and the oceans are not the
property of any particular State or group of States, but are a
common property of all nations on the globe&quot;, should create
a new conscience to control the contamination of these environmental
resources that effect the present and future generations of mankind.
<P>
It is a well known fact that the creation of new mechanisms or
institutions within the United Nations system has always raised
eyebrows and objections particularly when it relates to their
organizational and financial structures. These in fact are the
two major stumbling blocks which have caused divisiveness among
and between participants of the preparatory process for UNCED
where agreement has still to be reached particularly on how to
finance Agenda 21 and what institutional arrangement should be
established to monitor the implementation of Agenda 21.
<P>
One therefore appreciates the timely and valid proposal put forward
by Prof. de Marco during the Fortyfifth Session of the United
Nations General Assembly and later expounded in a number of lectures
he delivered in Genoa, Moscow, Beijing, Turin and Prague, on giving
an additional role to the UN Trusteeship Council, transforming
it into a guardian and supervisor of matters &quot;affecting the
Common Heritage and Common Concerns of an everlasting humanity.&quot;
<P>
During his Presidency, Prof. de Marco emphasized the need to revitalize
the United Nations General Assembly and through it the United
Nations. In mapping out a twelve point proposal on the future
role of a Second Generation United Nations, he spoke on the Trusteeship
Council, one of the the five major organs of the United Nations
System, as follows:
<P>
&quot;I feel that with a slight correction this body can be made
to function for the common wealth of man. I suggest that from
an administrator of territories, this Trusteeship Council be converted
into a guardian and supervisor of the common heritage of mankind.
The resources of the sea and of the seabad, the climate, the environment
particularly the protection of the extraterritorial zones and
the rights of future generations, all these priceless possessions
of humanity, invoke the creation of such a Council if they are
to be handed down to future generations&quot;.
<P>
It is a known fact that the role of the Trusteeship Council has
been reduced as a result of the attainment of independence by
those NonSelfGoverning Territories administered by a number of
Member States. It will also be
<P>
recalled that the Trusteeship Council was established under Chapter
XIII of the United Nations Charter to supervise the administration
of Trust Territories and to ensure that Governments responsible
for their administration took adequate steps to prepare them for
the achievement of the Charter goals. In the early years of the
United Nations, 11 Territories were placed under the Trusteeship
System. By 1975, all except the Trust Territory of the Pacific
Islands had either attained independence or were united with neighbouring
State to form an independent country.
<P>
Furthermore, the Trusteeship Agreements of three entities of the
Pacific Islands the Federated States if Micronesia, the Marshall
Islands and the Northern Mariana Islands were terminated by Security
Council resolution 683 on 22 December 1990. While the Northern
Marianas opted for Commonwealth status in 1975, the Federated
States of Micronesia and the Marshall Islands became full Members
of the United Nations Organization. Palau the lost remaining entity
of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands has yet to determine
its future status. Until then, the United States remains the Administering
Authority of Palau reporting periodicaIIy to the Trusteeship Council.
<P>
Now that the major goals of the Council have been achieved, consideration
could be given to the adaptation of the International Trusteeship
System under Article 75 to 91 of the UN Charter to guard and supervise
'the global commons' for the benefit of all nations. The Council
could align its present procedure of considering and examining
reports on matters affecting the Common Heritage and Common Concerns
thus ensuring cooperation on those critical and uncontrolled areas
described as the global commons.
<P>
In a 1977 report prepared for UNEP/IOC, Dr. Michael Waldichuk,
a leading Canadian marine scientist, stated that:
<P>
<I>Because the atmosphere and the oceans are not the property
of any particular State or group of States, but are a common property
of all the notions on the globe, there must be some control of
contamination of these environmental resources.</I>
<P>
While it must be recognized that since Dr.Waldichuk's report national
legislation as well as international multilateral conventions
and protocols have been adopted and mechanisms established for
safeguarding what man has, since his creation, considered as his
common property, there remains a need for a central authority
or organ that can truly assess the state of these global commons,
give guidance and examine how the norms of international cooperation
in the protection and preservation of the &quot;possessions of
humanity&quot; can be advanced and promoted further.
<P>
The relevance of such an &quot;authority&quot; is further accentuated
by the fact that no agreement was reached during the preparatory
phase of UNCED on the institutional arrangements concerning the
body that will be in charge of the detailed implementation of
Agenda 21.
<P>
In the light of this impasse, Malta intends to pursue its proposal
made at the last Fourth Preparatory Committee on giving an additional
assignment to the United Nations Trusteeship Council, by promoting
this initiative at the forthcoming session of UHCED in Rio next
month. This would give a broader institutional framework which
would ensure in the longer term the political momentum envisaged
to be generated in Rio.
<H4><B>A Proposal</B></H4>

<P>
As a complementary measure to the steps envisaged to be taken
at UNCED, it is my view that further enhancement of this initiative
could be achieved if a parallel process of momentum building is
undertaken at the earliest. In this regard, I wish to propose
a three stage plan that would sensitize and amplify the proposal
on the Trusteeship Council.
<P>
The first stage would be for this Mediterranean Academy of Diplomatic
Studies to prepare an indepth study on how the United Nations
Trusteeship Council could involve itself as a guardian for specific
environmental concerns. In the preparation of this study, the
assistance should be sought of UN bodies and programmes such as
UNEP, WMO, IMO, IOC and ILC
<P>
which could provide inputs at the experts and technical level.Once
this study is completed, an international expert meeting could
be organized where this report could be presented to a wider audience,
preferably composed of Government representatives. NonGovernmental
Organizations could also be involved in this review.
<P>
The third stage would be to submit the findings of the study plus
the views of Government representatives and NGO's, to a meeting
to be convened under the auspices of the United Nations and its
relevant Specialized Agencies that would prepare a final report
to the United Nations General Assembly for a decision.
<P>
This process should be seen as a translation into practical terms
of the discussions being held to revitalize and restructure the
work of the General Assembly, to reform and improve the efficiency
and effectiveness of the United Nations, particularly of its principal
organs.
<H4><B>Conclusion</B></H4>

<P>
The former Commonwealth SecretaryGeneral, Sir Shridath Ramphal,
in his address made at St. John's College in 1989, during the
inauguration of the Cambridge Lectures on Environment and Development:
Our Common Future, stated:
<P>
<I>Some international problems those concerned with the global
commons, the oceans and the ocean bed, the atmosphere, Antarctica,
which no one owns present particular problems. Unless access is
regulated in some way, rising demand will result in overuse. For
the global commons this means internationally agreed controls.
</I>
<P>
He further underlined the Brundtland Commission's message of a
&quot;common future&quot; in that the &quot;unspoken premise that
we must think of our planet not only as a world of many States
but also as the state of our one world; thus we
<P>
must be ready to nurture tomorrow's concepts of global governance,
not have them stifled at birth by yesterday's notions of national
sovereignty; that our common future may not be secured save by
the reach of enforceable law across environmentally invisible
frontiers.&quot;
<P>
The strengthened awareness and utility of the United Nations in
solving international political issues has increased the commitment
of all Member States to abide more scrupulously with the provisions
of the Charter of the Organization. While serious problems will
always exist, there is recognition that with determination and
will, collectively we can find durable solutions to these problems.
The problems faced by humanity in the protection and preservation
of our environment are many. A revitalized and restructured United
Nations can contribute towards this end. Some of its bodies may
no longer reflect the needs of present day commitments and could
be improved, if not reformed.
<P>
This is the case of the Trusteeship Council. Its effectiveness
has diminished if not disappeared. It can still play a role as
a Keeper of the Global Commons for Future Generations. Are we
ready to assist in bringing this idea to fruition?<A NAME="mark2">

<H3><B>THE EVOLUTION OF AN INTERNATIONAL REGIME OF ENVIRONMENTAL
PROTECTION IN THE AREAS BEYOND NATIONAL JURISDICTION</B></H3>

<P>
Statehood implies absolute sovereignty over a particular territory.
Matters within the competence of states under international law
are said to belong to the &quot;reserved domain&quot; and therefore
falling under the national jurisdiction of States. During these
last three decades a number of issues were internationalised and
politicised to become part of the international agenda. In this
context the environment has become a matter of international concern
rather than pertaining solely to the domestic jurisdiction of
States. The reasons for this are mainly twofold: first the degradation
of the environment knows no national boundaries and secondly the
effects of such degradation are not only transgressing boundaries
but also evident in areas lying beyond the limits of national
jurisdiction. The international legal framework relating to the
environment has evolved rapidly since the 1972 Stockholm Conference
on the Human Environment. However conflicts of interests between
States have often been the cause of sporadic efforts and ineffectual
results.
<P>
International Environmental Law attempts to achieve an equilibrium
between the protection of the environment and the sovereign right
of States to development. This entails the creation of a system
of rights and obligations in order to strike a proper balance
of interests and, where this equilibrium is disturbed, in order
to provide an adequate remedy. Efforts to protect the environment
mainly deal with activities which have a negative effect on areas
within State jurisdiction. This is understandable due to the fact
that a large number of environmentally harmful activities are
carried out within the territories of sovereign States, effective
enforcement
<P>
jurisdiction has traditionally belonged to States and the absence
of an effective international institutional authority, have further
encouraged this tendency. This approach, however, has proved to
be highly inadequate, because environmental harm is not only transnational
in scope but has also negative effects on areas beyond the limits
of national jurisdiction.
<P>
In this context, the international community has not yet succeeded
in developing an effective international regime which recognizes
the importance of regulating anthropogenic activities that have
an adverse effect on areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction,
whether these activities occur <U>within</U> or <U>outsidenational
borders</U>. Various treaties regulating these areas such as the
Outer Space Treaties and the Antarctica Treaties do exist; the
approach however is rather haphazard and piecemeal, despite the
interdependence which exists between these extraterritorial spaces.
<P>
Having participated in the various negotiating sessions for a
framework convention on climate change I have chosen to concentrate
particularly on this part of the environment which falls beyond
the limits of national jurisdiction but it can be said that the
legal regime established to protect climate from change can be
viewed as an example which may be adopted to safeguard other areas
lying outside territorial jurisdiction. It is therefore pertinent
to examine emerging issues during the sessions of negotiations,
to analyse whether the regime has met with expectations and where
it has failed, and what are the international regimes and mechanisms
needed for the future.
<H4><B>Sovereignty</B></H4>

<P>
Sovereignty has been the main stumbling block in achieving appropriate
commitments. Sovereignty has been defined as the State's absolute
and exclusive authority and control over its territory. The main
rule of this sovereign equality of States is the duty of each
State within the international community to refrain from intervention
in the external and internal affairs of
<P>
other States. Sovereignty is therefore an obstacle to provide
a solution to problems which are transnational in scope.
<P>
To qualify as an issue pertaining to the domestic jurisdiction
the matter has to be beyond the cognizance of International Law.
It is debatable whether a matter which falls essentially within
the domestic jurisdiction of States can be removed from the reserved
domain by becoming subject to a treaty obligation. In real fact
with respect to certain issues considered to be of international
concern by the United Nations General Assembly, the international
community has witnessed the erosion of the notion of the reserved
domain, i.e the domain of State activities where the jurisdiction
of the State is not limited by International Law. The notion of
reserved domain is relative because a State cannot plead provisions
of its Law or its deficiencies as a defence, whilst international
obligations may refer to national law as a means of describing
a status to be created and protected.
<P>
The traditional concept of sovereignty is often interpreted in
such a way as to be the root cause of marginality and residuality
of International Law as if a State owes duty to its citizens and
neighbouring States but not to the International Society as a
whole.
<P>
Sovereignty is used as a term to describe the legal personality
of a State and incidences of that personality in International
Law. In the <U>Island of Palmas Case</U>, it was held that concomitant
to the right of territorial sovereignty, a State has the duty
to protect within its territory the rights of other States. The
<U>Trail Smelter Arbitration</U><B> </B>case lays down that a
State has an obligation not to use its rights to the extent of
injuring the rights of others and the <U>Corfu Channel Case </U>confirms
this by acknowledging that the principle of sovereignty embodies
the obligation of every State not to allow its territory to be
used for acts contrary to the rights of others.
<P>
A proper balance between external competence and international
responsibility has not yet been attained. Sovereignty continues
to be abused of and used as a guise by States to avoid commitments
of an international nature. It has to be finetuned by States and
restructured to
<P>
meet with the needs of the formulation of a global strategy to
protect the International Commons.
<P>
In the preamble to the Climate Convention the parties agreed that:
<P>
States have in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations
and the principles of International law the sovereign right to
exploit their own resources, pursuant to their own environmental
policies and the responsibility to ensure that activities within
their jurisdiction or control do not cause damage to the environment
of other States or of areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction.
<P>
This first paragraph recalls Principle 21 and 22 of the Stockholm
Declaration. These two principles were the first attempt in International
Law to regulate environmental protection on a global scale. It
took these two principles, formerly considered as &quot;soft law&quot;,
twenty years to be embodied in a multilateral convention even
if they are only preambular rather than substantive in nature:
<P>
The parties reaffirm the principle of sovereignty of States
<P>
in international cooperation to address climate change.
<P>
This second paragraph is a blanket provision which was embodied
into the preamble after considerable debate. A number of States
insisted that nothing contained in the Convention could impinge
on the notion of sovereignty and therefore it was fallacious to
consider the need to reaffirm the principle of sovereignty of
States in the convention. But most of the developing States misinterpreted
this stand as a threat to this fundamental principle, a loophole
for the richer OECD States to stultify the development of the
poorer States.
<P>
As international concern for the environment increases, States
should move away from the primacy of the community of nations
and the primacy of government in stressing the paramount duty
of the heads of all States throughout the world to guarantee the
right to live in an environment fit to
<P>
sustain life. The negotiations for a Framework Convention on Climate
Change proved that the traditional concept of sovereignty remains
a formidable obstacle when tackling problems of an international
nature. These negotiations also brought to light an even greater
challenge to the traditional concept of State sovereignty which
is likely to cause a tremendous upheaval in the evolution of modern
International Law, as certain areas, although lying within the
territorial jurisdiction of a State, were identified to be of
international environmental concern the Amazon forest for instance
is an excellent example.
<H4><B>The sources of international environmental law</B></H4>

<P>
Although International Environmental Law, is still in an embryonic
stage, there exist various rules, standards and guidelines which
regulate to some extent the protection of areas beyond national
jurisdiction. The innovative nature of these rules is that they
are also preventive and precautionary besides being responsive.
<P>
In the <U>Antarctica Treaty</U> and the <U>Treaty on Principles
Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use
of Outer Space</U> the parties attempted in some way to regulate
the environment on a universal level and acknowledged that effective
results in protecting the international commons can only be achieved
through coordination between governments and other policy makers.
<P>
Two fundamental legal principles emerge from the Convention on
Marine Pollution from Land-Based Sources: first, the obligation
of States to protect the environment and their corresponding strict
liability and secondly the requirement to study alternative measures
for attaining environmental objectives.
<P>
<U>UNCLOS III</U> builds upon the principles found in the Stockholm
Declaration. It proposes a balance of interests by recognizing
that countries shall take all necessary measures &quot;to ensure
that activities under
<P>
their jurisdiction or control are so conducted as not to cause
damage by pollution to other States and that pollution arising
from incidents or activities under their jurisdiction or control
do not spread beyond the areas where they exercise sovereign rights
in accordance with the convention&quot;. The convention requires
environmental impact assessments of the potential effects, when
countries believe that their planned activities may cause substantial
pollution or harmful changes to the marine environment. It also
states that countries shall cooperate in studies, research, exchange
of information and data and in establishing appropriate scientific
criteria. It grants preferential treatment to developing countries
in the allocation of funds, technical assistance and specialized
services.
<P>
The &quot;<U>Convention on LongRange Transboundary Air Pollution
</U>&quot; defines 'air pollution' and 'long range transboundary
air pollution' for the purposes of the convention in its very
first article. These definitions are of fundamental importance
as they determine what falls within the ambit of international
law for the purposes of the convention. This definition takes
into consideration that pollution is transboundary if it has adverse
effects in other areas beyond the jurisdiction of the polluter
and:
<P>
it is not generally possible to distinguish the contribution of
individual
<P>
emission sources or groups of sources.
<P>
The Parties to the Convention based their considerations upon
the Declaration of the <U>UN Conference on the Human Environment
</U>particularly <U>Art.21</U>, namely, that States have the sovereign
right to exploit their natural resources according to their own
environmental policies and the responsibility not to cause damage
to the environment of other States or of areas beyond the limits
of national jurisdiction by activities carried out within their
jurisdiction or control. Although this ECE Convention dutifully
invokes <U>Principle 21</U> of the <U>Stockholm Declaration</U>in
its preamble, during the negotiations the Government of the Federal
Republic of Germany reportedly stipulated that preambles have
no force of law and that in any case it does not hold itself to
be legally bound by <U>Principle 21</U>. Another weakness in the
convention is the fact that it does not contain any rules on State
liability, but with regard to settlement of disputes, <U>Art.13
</U>states that:
<P>
If a dispute arises between two or more contracting parties to
the present convention as to the interpretation or application
of the convention, they shall seek a solution by negotiation or
by any other method of dispute settlement acceptable to the parties
to the dispute.
<P>
The Convention is the first international accord on air pollution,
its Chairman Johnson, hailed it as &quot;a breakthrough in the
development of International Environmental Law&quot; but not all
consider it so. It has been critizised because it includes no
mechanism for the enforcement of its terms, nor does it delineate
the responsibility of member States to abate pollution causing
damage in another State or to award compensation for such damage.
<P>
The <U>Vienna Convention on the Protection of the Ozone Layer
</U>sets down general principles and a series of specific protocols
including the <U>Montreal Protocol</U>. The Convention shows that
the international community is able to deal effectively on a multilateral
level with the serious problem of ozone depletion. in its preamble,
the <U>Vienna Convention</U> recalls <U>Principle 21</U> of the
<U>Stockholm Declaration</U>. It lays down a number of legal principles
which have come to be considered as the basics of International
Environmental Law.
<P>
Under the general obligations, the convention lays down that the
parties should cooperate in the scientific, technical and legislative
fields and requires the use of measures of a predetermined standard
to combat pollution, in particular the adoption of administrative
and legal measures. The Convention obliges countries to cooperate
in the formulation of agreed measures, standards and procedures
and with the competent international bodies. The Convention states
that developing nations are to receive information on alternative
technologies, necessary equipment, facilities for research and
training of scientific personnel. Perhaps this is one of the reasons
which made the <U>Vienna Convention</U> a success, because often
developing countries cannot afford to adopt new technical measures
due to financial problems. Receiving assistance from industrialised
countries would help them to overcome such difficulties.
<P>
The <U>Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone
Layer</U> (1987) has been described by US President Reagan as
a &quot;<U>monumental achievement</U>&quot; and by UNEP's director
Mostafa Tolba as &quot;<U>the beginning of a new era of environmental
statesmanship</U>&quot;. It is an agreement reached by representatives
of countries from every region of the world, an achievement which
has always been deemed to be impossible in the diplomatic sphere.
But it is remarkable mostly because of its preventive nature,
rather than its being simply a response to an environmental disaster
on a global scale, because the Protocol establishes international
controls on certain chemicals that destroy the stratospheric ozone
and aggravate the greenhouse effect. The parties not only established
controls with the full knowledge that these might have serious
repercussions on the chemical industry but also agreed upon target
dates for emissions reduction, even though technology has not
yet offered alternative solutions to be able to accomplish these
goals.
<P>
Amongst the emerging legal principles we find once again the recognition
of the transboundary nature of pollution. The protocol emphasizes
that States have the responsibility to prevent, minimise and eliminate
pollution from land based sources and it establishes joint programmes
of scientific and technical research to determine the best methods
of reducing pollution. As in the case of the Vienna Convention,
special attention was given to developing States. The Protocol
in fact entitles developing States to delay compliance with control
methods for ozone depletion, whilst promising them assistance.
<P>
Although at first negotiating parties were far apart in their
positions, political consensus was achieved as a result of the
development of a commonly accepted body of data and analysis.
The initial framework agreement in the <U>Vienna Convention on
the Protection of the Ozone Layer</U> provided a useful model.
It has helped governments to launch coordinated scientific research
which served as a guide to the formulation of a common policy.
The Protocol is a dynamic and flexible instrument with many innovative
features. There are provisions which represent creative resolutions
that can lead the way for the future protocols or resolutions,
<P>
such as the trigger mechanism for entry into force, fixed target
dates for reductions, twostage voting to reflect the large shareholders
interests and transitional provisions for developing countries.
The Protocol is not a static solution but an ongoing process.
The parties to the Protocol considered the risks of waiting for
more complete evidence to be too great. Consensus was achieved
irrespective of uncertainty which seems to be omnipresent in international
environmental relations. This global threat has demonstrated that
the international community is capable of accepting the common
responsibility to safeguard present and future generations and
of undertaking complex cooperative actions despite the ambiguity
of the situation. The <U>Montreal Protocol</U> serves as a prototype
for the development of new diplomatic approaches to emerging global
issues such as climate change. The problem of climate change is
even more complex than the protection of the ozone layer, because
there are more contributing factors, more wide ranging and uncertain
consequences and above all more economically painful choices.
The framework Convention on Climate Change provides for various
protocols which are likely to be negotiated in the near future.
It is through these protocols that adequate measures to protect
the climate would be formulated.
<P>
Besides these multilateral conventions there are also a number
of bilateral treaties or treaties between small groups of States.
These treaties are usually 'contractual' in nature, as opposed
to 'lawmaking treaties' which lay down rules of universal and
general application. Contractual treaties deal with special matters
concerning the parties exclusively but although not a direct source
of International law they may still have a lawmaking effect. Contractual
treaties in fact, may constitute 'particular rules' between the
parties, or contribute to the formation of international law by
establishing norms which may later crystallize into custom. Examples
of contractual treaties on pollution are: the <U>Nordic Convention
</U>signed by Scandinavian countries which provides a framework
for abatement and for compensatory relief for persons injured
by transboundary air or water pollution and the <U>Tripartite
Agreement</U> between the US, France and the UK.
<P>
Treaties concerning air pollution may be split into two groups.
There are treaties imposing obligations on a contracting party
to inform and consult with other States when activities within
the jurisdiction of the former cause harmful affects to the environment
of the latter or to the global commons. Such treaties lay down
coordinated research programs and data exchanges. An example would
be the <U>Convention on Long Range Transboundary Air Pollution
</U>(1979). Other treaties go one step further and include provisions
for settlement of disputes, such as the right of access to administrative
bodies or municipal courts. In other cases an impartial commission
is set up. This is mostly the case with bilateral agreements such
as the USCanadian Joint Commission. The <U>Vienna Convention of
the Protection of the Ozone Layer </U>(1985), belongs to the latter
category. There are two main queries regarding the position of
treaties in Public International Law. The first is whether treaties
are of legal significance only as between the parties and the
second is whether they play a role in the evolution of customary
law or whether they are declaratory of it.
<P>
It is always a problem to confirm whether a customary rule exists
or not in International Law, particularly when it comes to environmental
issues. The existence of a customary rule which regulates protection
of the environment, whether damage is transboundary or extraterritorial,
has always been traditionally based on the maxim &quot;sic utero
tuo ut alienum non laedas&quot;. However the legal nature of this
principle has at times been challenged by States as not being
legally binding. The <U>Trail Smelter Arbitration</U> case however
acknowledges this principle on the part of the sovereign State
not to use its territory to cause damage to another sovereign
State whilst the <U>Stockholm Declaration</U> adopted and elaborated
this obligation to include also these areas beyond national jurisdiction.
A useful antecedent for the formation of legal principles concerning
the protection of the environment on a global scale emerges from
the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in the <U>Corfu Channel
Case</U>, when it recognized that every State has the obligation
not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary
to the rights of other States. In this context extra-territorial
spaces are also covered because these areas, although beyond national
jurisdiction, are the patrimony of the whole
<P>
international community. This is also the case with another emerging
legal principle, this time from the <U>Lake Lanoux Arbitration
</U>. The Tribunal in this case strived to achieve a balance between
rights and duties in international law, and established that a
State has a right to make use of its resources but not to the
extent of ignoring the rights of others.
<P>
Although in International Law the decisions of the ICJ and its
predecessor the PCIJ, are not considered as binding legal precedents
they are considered by international lawyers to be the expression
of what the most authoritative international judicial body holds
to be the position in International Law under those particular
circumstances. Even international arbitral tribunals commonly
act according to judicial principles rather than basing their
arbitral adjudications on a compromise. Besides all this, the
ICJ may play another role in the formation of International Law
through an advisory opinion sought by other UN organs. This would
prove to be very valuable particularly in the face of all the
uncertainty which surrounds the international legal principles
regulating the protection of those areas beyond national jurisdiction.
<P>
It is not my intention to enter into the merits of whether soft
law should be considered as a source of International Law or not.
Its importance however should not be undermined, particularly
during the negotiations for the drafting of multilateral treaty.
Principles embodied in UNGA resolutions or other declarations
emanating from international meetings have undisputable weight,
particularly when adopted unanimously. The notion of &quot;common
concern&quot; for example was at times attacked and a few delegations
sought its deletion from the draft text during the negotiating
sessions for a framework Convention on Climate Change. The very
fact that the climate had been unanimously acknowledged as a &quot;Common
Concern of Humankind&quot; in four consecutive UNGA resolutions
(43/53; 44/207; 45/212; 46/169), gave this new concept a special
status and, although not acknowledged as a substantive principle
of International Law, it was established as the first preambular
paragraph of the Convention on Climate Change. The Climate Convention
promotes
<P>
cooperation between States in taking measures to implement the
convention providing financial and technological assistance to
developing countries.
<P>
It has as its objective &quot;the stabilisation of greenhouse
gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent
dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.&quot;
<P>
The convention acknowledges the need that the parties &quot;should
take precautionary measures to anticipate, prevent or minimise
the causes of climate change and mitigate its adverse effects&quot;.
<P>
It is sad to note however that one of the basic rules and standards
in International Environmental Law, namely Principle 21 and 22
of the Stockholm Declaration have been embodied only in the preamble.
The Convention does not in fact account for liability elsewhere
except in this preambular paragraph:
<P>
Recalling that States have, in accordance with the Charter of
the United Nations and <U>The Principles of International Law
</U>, the sovereign right to exploit their own resources pursuant
to their own environmental and development policies, and the responsibility
to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction or control
do not cause damage to the environment of other States or of areas
beyond the limits of national jurisdiction.
<P>
The wording of the paragraph recognizes this right and duty to
be a principle of International Law. The parties however were
reluctant to include it in Article 3 as one of the principles
to the Convention.
<H4><B>State responsibility</B></H4>

<P>
The question of liability brings us to examine the notion of State
responsibility under International Environmental Law. The responsibility
of States for internationally wrongful acts arises out of the
nature of the international legal system.
<P>
The existing sources of International Environmental Law do imply
that there is an obligation upon States to protect the environment
of other States and also of the International Commons. Even if
there is no specific positive rule forbidding environmentally
harmful activities under International law, liability results
from the nonapplication of principles of a preventive character
and the obligation of international cooperation among States for
the protection of the environment. As International Environmental
Law evolved from various sources and State practice over these
last decades, it has begun to generate subsidiary principles of
behaviour in the environmental field that tend to have substantive
implications or effects. The main subsidiary norms can be grouped
thus:
<P>
(a) The duty to conduct environmental impact studies before launching
on a project that may adversely effect the environment.
<P>
(b) The duty to inform and consult other States which may have
an interest in the effects of a particular project or activity.
<P>
(c) The duty to warn other States in the event of an accident
with environmental implications.
<P>
(d) The duty to deal on the basis of nondiscrimination and equality,
with persons, whether, they are nationals or foreigners because
they may have an interest in some environmental question either
as victims after the event, or as individuals providing suggestions
on the prevention of environmental damage.
<P>
(e) The obligation to avoid harmful environmental damage has been
said to include also the obligation to take all the necessary
measures to ensure that activities within the jurisdiction or
control of a State conform to international rules and standards
for the protection of the environment of other States or areas
beyond national jurisdiction, as they arise from various treaties
dealing with the common waters, marine areas, outer space and
Antarctica.
<P>
However, it has never been put to test as to whether these norms
are considered to be binding among States. The Chernobyl Nuclear
Accident brought to light the inadequacy of International Law
on the subject. The existence of an international obligation upon
sovereign States to refrain from carrying out activities within
and outside their jurisdiction which might have an impact on extra
territorial spaces is likely to prove rather difficult to assert.
<H4><B>The Common Concern Concept</B></H4>

<P>
It is clear that the classical issues of State to State liability
and the traditional notion of legal standing under the present
system of International Law are inadequate to deal with the devastating
damage which State activities are causing in areas beyond national
jurisdiction. Such an issue, which concerns the very existence
of mankind and life as we know it on our planet, cannot remain
part of the &quot;reserved domain&quot; of States. It is on this
basis that the UNGA Resolution 43/53 recognises specifically that
Climate Change is a &quot;Common Concern of Mankind, since climate
is an essential condition which sustains life on earth.&quot;
<P>
The Maltese initiative to request the inclusion of the item entitled
&quot;<U>Conservation of Climate as part of the Common Heritage
of Mankind</U>&quot; in the provisional agenda of the 43rd Session
of the General Assembly, attracted widespread support both at
the General Assembly plenary meeting and at the 2nd Committee,
where Malta formally presented its draft resolution.
<P>
Malta's draft resolution was adopted in the 2nd Committee, following
some amendments which were acceptable to Malta. In fact, due to
the unhappy history of the 'Common Heritage' concept a number
of States objected to the idea of classifying climate as part
of the &quot;Common Heritage of Mankind&quot;. Malta's intentions
however were not to speak in terms of appropriation of any part
of the climate but in terms of protecting it. Its ultimate aim
was to ensure that by addressing the problem of climate change
on a multilateral basis, it would lead the international community
towards the formulation of an effective and comprehensive strategy
to protect the global climate from change as a result of State
activities. The Assembly's General Committee accepted Malta's
request and on the 6th December 1988, Resolution 43/53 entitled
&quot;<U>Protection of the Global Climate for Present and Future
Generations</U>&quot; was adopted unanimously in the plenary.
<P>
The international community sustained this innovative concept
and unanimously classified climate change as a Common Concern
of Mankind in the Resolution adopted by the General Assembly.
This concept of &quot;Common Concern&quot; is closely related
to other international concepts, such as the &quot;common interest&quot;,
the &quot;international commons&quot;, the concept of &quot;intergenerational
rights&quot; and to the concept of the &quot;Common Heritage of
Mankind&quot;. The latter concept has been incorporated in a 1979
agreement governing the <U>Activities of States on the Moon and
other Celestial Bodies </U>with respect to the moon and its natural
resources and in the 1982 <U>Convention on the Law of The Sea
</U>(UNCLOSIII) with respect to certain areas of the seabed, ocean
floor and subsoil. It has been applied to areas and resources
found outside the national jurisdiction of States, as it proposes
the common management of the earth's resources. But in the political
sphere it has always caused much debate and has also been defined
as &quot;a rush consent by the hungry, to gobble down sundry goods,
spread out on somebody's else's table.&quot;
<P>
Areas beyond national jurisdiction are certainly an integral part
of mankind's heritage. Such areas are a natural resource to be
utilised by all States but which cannot be abused or tampered
with to the detriment of
<P>
present and future generations. Consequently, it cannot be left
to individual States to unilaterally decide whether, and which,
conservation measures should be taken to protect them. The concept
of &quot;Common Heritage&quot; refers to &quot;patrimony&quot;,
whilst the term &quot;concern&quot; is more general. It speaks
of concerted action rather than benefit sharing: it is closer
to &quot;interest&quot; implying a series of rights and obligations.
<P>
The Common Concern concept is traceable in various Resolutions
and Declarations of the General Assembly. The debates of the UN
Charter speak of matters considered to be of &quot;international
jurisdiction because they are of an international concern.&quot;
In 1972, the <U>Stockholm Declaration on the Human Environment
</U>expressly referred to the &quot;common good of mankind.&quot;
Two years later the UN Charter on Economic Rights and Duties stressed
that &quot;the duty of protection and preservation of the environment
for present and future generations was the responsibility of all
States.&quot; In 1980, the General Assembly adopted a resolution
on the historic responsibility of States to protect the environment
for the benefit of present and future generations. In 1989, UNGA
Resolution 44/228 convened a UN Conference on Environment and
Development and the General Assembly pointed out that environmental
problems in their global dimension required action at all levels
involving the commitment and participation of all countries.
<P>
To understand the legal implications of the Common Concern concept,
it is necessary to analyse its two component elements. The first
element of &quot;common concern&quot; could be interpreted as
an analogous to the term &quot;common interest&quot;, which means
that the issue is a matter which concerns all States and all the
members of the world community. In the <U>Barcelona Traction Case
</U>, the ICJ held that there are two types of obligations under
International law those obligations arising between a number of
States because of some agreement considered to be binding, under
international law and <I>erga omnes</I> obligations. Defining
extra-territorial spaces as a &quot;Common Concern of Mankind&quot;
(as already is the case with Climate Change) implies that, any
obligations in this respect run <B>erga omnes</B>. The International
Law Commission itself, in its draft articles on State
<P>
Responsibility recognized the superiority of fundamental interests
of the international community, stating that the breach of an
international obligation, so essential for the protection of such
interests, constitutes an international crime. In <U>Art 19</U>of
the same draft, it stated that &quot;an international crime may
result inter alia from .....a serious breach of an international
obligation of essential importance for the safeguarding and preservation
of the human environment, such as prohibiting massive pollution
of the atmosphere or of the seas.&quot; Consequently, any State
should have a standing to make representations to any other State
concerning the latter's activities and policies which are harmful
to the human environment without having to allege that it is directly
affected.
<P>
This is in fact the position with respect to legal standing in
the case of pollution of the marine environment in the convention
on Marine Pollution from Land Based sources.
<P>
Any significant pollution of the marine environment is of concern
to all States. Any State may complain to the offending State or
to an appropriate international agency, against the violation
of generally accepted international rules and standards for the
protection of the marine environment by another State or its nationals
or ships.
<P>
The possibility of development of customary rules, that with respect
to the natural resources there exists a collective interest which
may be vindicated by any State, was mentioned by the International
Law Commission in its Draft on State Responsibility. This approach
links the whole issue of environmental protection with the protection
of human rights, also classified as an <I>erga omnes</I> obligation.
States have a legal standing in such cases even if events happening
within the jurisdiction of other States do not directly involve
or jeopardise their interests.
<P>
Defining areas beyond national jurisdiction as &quot;A Common
Concern of Mankind&quot; may also be interpreted as extending
the fundamental human right to life to include the right to a
healthy and safe environment. If this
<P>
aspect of the Common Concern concept is developed, it would also
be possible to say that there is a standing to complain about
prospective harm to extra territorial spaces anywhere in the world
by means of an <I>Actio Popularis<B>,</B></I> which under International
Law is only possible under <U>Art 24</U> of the <U>European Convention
on the Protection of Human Rights</U>. Although this would create
new problems with the possibility of over-zealous complaints,
such harm would be legitimised by broadened notions of standing
which is likely to create less harm than that which results from
activities which cannot effectively be challenged unless particularised
effects on individual States are apparent.
<P>
The second element &quot;Humankind&quot;, is more controversial
as it does not only refer to vindication for a collective interest
but also to the temporal aspect of the whole concept. The term
&quot;Humankind&quot; includes all those who influence international
decision-making: that is, not only governments but also NGOs,
citizen groups, the scientific community and public opinion.
<P>
The Common Concern concept has three facets. The spatial facet
implies that there must be co-operation between all States on
matters being similarly important to all nations and to the whole
international community. Another facet is the social aspect of
the concept. All structures of society are involved in the process
of combating global environmental threats, but legal guarantees
are also required to support it. The third facet is the temporal
aspect which is two-fold. Protection of the international environment
therefore, may be classified as an inter-generation right, described
as : &quot;the right of every human being and of all human beings
taken collectively&quot;. This aspect of the Common Concern concept
evokes the idea of &quot;public trust&quot; extending protection
to the beneficiaries of future generations in terms of International
Law, but the scope of this concept comprises the protection of
the well-being and viability of future generations.
<P>
These facets of the Common Concern concept can be traced in positive
International Environmental Law. The <U>World Heritage Convention
</U>of 1972, in its preamble, refers to &quot;the heritage of
all nations of the world.&quot; The <U>Convention on International
Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and</U>
<P>
<U>Fauna</U>, 1973 recognizes in the preamble that &quot;wild
fauna and flora... are an irreplaceable part of the natural system
of the earth which must be protected for this and the generations
to come.&quot;
<P>
The Commonwealth countries which represent one fourth of the world's
population in the <U>Langkawi Summit</U> of October 1989, expressed
their deep concern &quot;at the serious deterioration of the environment
and the threat this poses to the well-being of the present and
future generations&quot;, and also that the &quot;current threat
to the environment which is a common concern of all mankind, stems
essentially from past neglect in managing the natural environment
and resources.&quot;
<P>
The wide application of this new notion in International Law by
the world community reflects a consensus which in the long run
may reach an <B>opinio iuris</B> on the applicability of the concept
to a wide range of global environmental issues. The <U>Declaration
of the UNGA Special Session on Development and Co-operation</U>states:
<P>
The current threat to the environment is the common concern of
all. All countries should take effective measures for the protection
and enhancement of the environment, in accordance with their respective
capacities and responsibilities and taking into account the specific
needs of developing countries.
<P>
The provisions of this declaration might serve as a description
of the common concern concept as it includes important aspects
essential to the concept itself. These are:
<P>
1. Sustainable Development
<P>
2. Subsequent Rights and Obligations
<P>
3. Inter-relations between developed and developing States.
<P>
Also when one analyses all these international documents which
have referred to the concept, it is evident that the notion of
&quot;common concern of mankind&quot; serves as a consolidating
factor between all the countries of the world despite the geographical,
economic and political differences existing between them. This
obligation to co-operate should involve all countries and all
levels of concerted actions; the concept of ecological interdependence
has obtained not only spatial but also temporal parameters. The
concept of common concern should develop into a principle which
allows the international community to act on matters which are
of common interest. The principle of domestic jurisdiction can
no longer be allowed to be used as a defence when the global well-being
is at stake. The joint efforts of governments, the scientific
community, legal experts and the public opinion are of crucial
importance for the concept of &quot;Common Concern of Humankind&quot;,
such that it does not remain a vague political formula but should
be interpreted in terms of legal rights and duties, to become,
for the international community, a source of action-oriented,
binding obligations.
<P>
The object of International Environmental Law is to regulate inter-State
relations or the activities of International Organizations, which
involve environmental issues. As we have seen, the current situation
however, does not adequately regulate State activities which have
a harmful effect on the international commons. The magnitude of
the problem requires the development of innovative, legal and
conventional proposals to meet this threat facing humankind. Despite
the widespread recognition of the catastrophic effects on these
areas, this is far from an easy task, particularly because of
the very nature of International Law.
<P>
The methodology adopted to implement these goals must be framed
in such a way as to gain the adherence of a large number and a
balanced range of States. It might include the adoption of uniform
standards or choosing flexible approaches to accommodate developing
States, such as transferable allowances and incentives.
<P>
Environmental damage to areas beyond national jurisdiction would
affect directly or indirectly all strata of society. The international
community therefore should continue to strive towards a broader
understanding of the issue, so as to facilitate the adoption and
the implementation of an effective and comprehensive legal strategy
intended to protect the very existence of life on earth.
<P>
&quot;No species has ever had such wholesale control over everything
on earth, living or dead as we now have. That lays upon us, whether
we like it or not an awesome responsibility. In our hands now
lies not only our own future, but that of all other living creatures
with whom we share the earth.&quot;<A NAME="reference"></A><HR>

<H3><B>DISCUSSION</B></H3>

<P>
<B>Professor Attard</B> said the two Maltese proposals are complementary
because the proposed group would identify and assess the environment
of extra-territorial spaces whilst the Trusteeship Council would
be given the task to protect them.
<P>
<B>Dr. Boldirev</B> noted that, as the Trusteeship Council proposal
is a Maltese initiative, the steps envisaged in the first paper
could be undertaken by the Maltese Government without the Rio
Conference's endorsement. But where does the group of eminent
persons fit in?
<P>
<B>Professor Attard </B>explained that the two concepts are indeed
complementary but should be dealt with separately during a first
stage. They should not be dependent on each other because if one
does not materialise, this should not affect the other.
<P>
<B>Dr. Boldirev</B> noted that in this case the Colloquium could
reaffirm its support for the group of eminent persons and also
support the Trusteeship Council initiative.
<P>
<B>Professor Attard </B>suggested that one could go one step further
and add that in its discussions the group could also consider
the possible role of the Trusteeship Council.
<P>
<B>Dr. Boldirev</B> proposed the following:
<P>
1. In respect of Prof Attard's proposal, if such a group is to
be established, then it should be &quot;in consultation with ther
executive heads of the other specialised agencies concerned&quot;.
<P>
2. With respect to the Trusteeship Council proposal, in the second
paragraph there is mention of assistance. This should be changed
to &quot;scientific and technical advice and any assistance...&quot;
<P>
<B>Dr. Keckes</B> said that most of the problems in extra-territorial
spaces have their origins in national jurisdictions. Control here
is within the hands of governments. Thus what would be the best
strategy to follow?
<P>
1. Demonstrate that there is a real problem with solid arguments.
<P>
2. Identify problems of spaces, activities and resources which
are beyond national jurisdiction in one respect but within it
as regards others in a limited way. (Some are of the opinion that
these have already been identified).
<P>
3. Create a very competent group of people to prompt the United
Nations General Assembly into action. This would necessitate a
variegated composition of the group which should include legal
experts as well as scientists and specialists in other fields.
For many studies separate groups would be necessary which in some
cases already exist.
<P>
4. Try to merge the advice obtained from the experts into political
action. Here someone has to examine the adequacy of existing law
and judge what has to be done.
<P>
How to get it done is the diplomatic process but this should be
separate from the legal and scientific approach.
<P>
<B>Mr. Savior Borg</B> said that the transformation of the Trusteeship
Council would necessitate amending the UN Charter which is obviously
very difficult.
<P>
<B>Professor Kappeler</B> noted that what was being proposed merged
beautifully together. The group of eminent persons could be the
perfect people to see where the advice is located and how to obtain
it.
<P>
<B>Professor Birnie</B> asked how the group of eminent persons
is to be funded and how the role of the Trusteeship Council could
be changed without amending the Charter?
<P>
<B>Mr. Saviour Borg </B>said that the three stage approach he
had suggested might help in paving the way for overcoming the
final difficulty of amending the Charter.
<P>
<B>Professor Attard</B> noted that if the General Assembly decides
to set up the group a budgetary provision would be made for it.
<P>
<B>Professor Birnie</B> suggested that UNCED should prove to be
a very fertile ground for other proposals.
<P>
<B>Professor Attard </B>asked Dr. Boldirev whether member States
would have the capacity to request the Secretary General of the
World Meteorological Organization to produce a study on the atmospheric
environment of the extra-territorial spaces.
<P>
<B>Dr. Boldirev</B> answered that if a statement is requested
the Executive Council of the Organization would definitely have
to be involved, but if the requeste comes from a State, one would
have to see. Whatever proposal will be endorsed by Rio and accepted
by the General Assembly, this would help the aim of this Colloquium.
Should everything fail the group of eminent persons would remain
the only available option. The Colloquium could suggest that:
<P>
1. A high level organ of the UN be made to support the proposal
to appoint a group of eminent persons;
<P>
2. The proposal to enlarge the mandate of the Trusteeship Council
should be considered.
<P>
<B>Professor Attard</B> was of the opinion that a group of persons
with special expertise in their field was necessary to produce
a report and to ascertain whether there is a problem and whether
it should be tackled or not.
<P>
<B>Professor Birnie</B> suggested that any conclusion should take
into account that:
<P>
1. Further studies are required urgently.
<P>
2. This is a very complex problem.
<P>
3. Any initiative for such a study should be endorsed but one
cannot neglect any of the various proposals being made.
<P>
A draft conclusion was then proposed by <B>Professor Kappeler
</B>and circulated for consideration by the participants.

<H3><B>Introduction</B></H3>

<P>
 Spaces beyond the limits of national jurisdiction are land, sea
and air spaces as well as outer space<A HREF="#endnotes" >(1)  
</A>. The only land space within this category is the Antarctic
continent, removed from national jurisdiction by the Antarctica
Treaty. Sea spaces are the maritime surfaces beyond territorial
seas and the seabed beyond the limits of the continental shelves.
Air space beyond national jurisdiction is the air space covering
land and sea spaces which are themselves beyond national jurisdiction.
The delimitation of outer space with regard to air space is controversial.
<P>
Antarctica has no territorial neighbours, so that protection of
its land surfaces, territorial waters and continental shelf is
obviously a common concern, not only of the parties to the Antarctica
Treaty but of humanity in general, as shown by the impact of the
yearly ozone hole that appears over the continent. Favourable
and unfavourable impacts on the maritime and atmospheric environment
tend to circulate freely, being carried onwards by maritime currents
and atmospheric winds. They may produce their effects in places
far removed from their origin.
<P>
In consideration of the above, it is obvious that no single State,
no bilateral arrangement will be able to protect the environment
beyond the limits of national jurisdiction with any effectiveness.
Only multilateral treaties imposing rules on all concerned, which
often means the international community as a whole, can provide
effective protection. This is why the Rio Conference has been
convened. Within the framework of global conventions, regional
and subregional arrangements may be possible and even desirable,
and within both global and regional or subregional frameworks
bilateral arrangements may make sense or even be necessary. One
may mention here the need of environmental clauses in bilateral
agreements on development cooperation.
<P>
The diplomacy of protecting the environment beyond the limits
of national jurisdiction is thus inevitably multilateral. This
means that the possibilities of individual actors, even big and
powerful ones, are limited. Moreover, the subject-matter, i.e.
protection of the environment, means that cooperation of all concerned,
the willing and the unwilling ones, is required to produce the
desired result. It will not suffice to draft nice treaties that
States will be free to ratify or accede to or not. Only treaties
which will be ratified or acceded to by all concerned will be
useful. This will immensly complicate negotiations. There are
of course treaties that anyone will accept to become party to
because they only contain pious recommendations and platitudes,
are so vague that eveyone can interpret provisions to suit his
purposes, and lack any form of sanction. This again will not do
because the desired effect will then not be achieved. One might
as well forgo the costly exercise of convening lengthy international
conferences if the result will only be this.
<P>
This paper considers the preparation of environmental negotiatons,
the required briefs, the actual negotiating process as well as
the drafting of the treaties which should be the outcome of such
negotiations. This is being done with special regard to the issue
at hand: the protection of the environment beyond the limits of
national jurisdiction.
<H4><B>Preparing the negotiators</B></H4>

<P>
Grounding in international law
<P>
Desirable negotiators for our purpose should have a solid background
in international law, both as regards its principles and with
respect to State practice, past and present. This is essential
if treaties negotiated are to be easy to understand, do not offer
loopholes permitting escape from apparently binding obligations,
and provide the kind of sanctions that will ensure their actual
implementation by the parties. Special familiarity will be required
with international environmental law, as this is the branch of
international law which deals with the regulation of often complex
scientific issues in a manner that will ensure that they are properly
handled.
<P>
Grasp of scientific issues
<P>
Understanding of the scientific issues involved is also essential.
This does not only mean some failiarity with terms like global
warming, climate change, ozone layer depletion, maintaining of
biological diversity. It means that the issues and principles
underlying these terms must be grasped, so that even the course
of scientific argumentation can be understood. Of course there
will be scientists available as consultants<A HREF="#endnotes" >(2)  
</A>. But their explanations and advice can only be understood
if the diplomat has a general grasp of the issues discussed. Scientific
knowledge is all the more important as there are constant attempts
at demagogic obfuscation, using isolated bits of evidence to defeat
those who argue for concerted action against such matters as the
use of fluorcarbones or the uncontrolled escape of sulphuric gases.
One should be able to understand for example how the penetration
of volcanic dust from the recent Pinatubo eruption produces a
layer that prevents the effects of global warming from being felt
for several years.
<P>
Understanding of environmental diplomacy
<P>
Just as essential as familiarity with underlying scientific issues
is an understanding of the peculiarities of environmental diplomacy.
There is for instance the economic aspect. Countries are asked
to forgo some types of development because of its negative ecological
implications. Tropical countries are asked to stop overexploiting
and burning down virgin tropical forests and to replant exploited
surfaces in the interest of humanity, much of which lives a lot
better than their own population. Conversely, developed countries
are asked to pay penalties for having spoilt the world environment
during their own industrialisation, including where, at the time
of the damage, the environmental implications were unknown. Proposing
and promoting global solidarity that would lead to a generally
acceptable form of burden sharing must be done in a manner that
carries conviction and does not sound like lofty preaching of
the rich to the poor or the supposedly victimised poor to the
rich.
<P>
Levels and institutions of training
<P>
This raises the question of how environmental diplomats can be
produced and traditional diplomats can be re-trained for the purposes
of environmental diplomacy. The answer varies to some extent according
to the countries concerned. In a country like the USA, Japan or
even China, where a great number of persons should be trained
or re-trained, national programmes can easily be worked out with
the cooperation of a plethora of qualified scientific and ordinary
training institutions. At the other end of the scale, we have
small and often poor countries, mini-States with minuscule diplomatic
services. These must obviously rely on facilities elsewhere to
enhance the preparedness of their diplomats. But would the Maldives
wish to train their diplomats in the USA, when their basic concern
is physical survival of their islands in rising sea-levels, whereas
the US economy is likely to be very adversely affected by most
measures taken to reduce global warming?
<P>
It is in this context that regional training facilities can be
of considerable help. They can produce programmes tailored to
the requirements of different types of countries. At the same
time, by bringing together diplomats from a number of countries
with similar or differing outlooks and aims, they can provide
a forum for sharpening conceptions and approaches or, in the case
of diplomats from countries with different outlooks, they can
help to promote better mutual understanding. With time permitting,
certain types of negotiations could even be simulated, thus providing
participants with better views of the kind of outcome that could
be expected. UNITAR is currently seeking to promote programmes
for the training of environmental negotiators. In so doing it
is considering the differing needs and goals of various types
of countries and attempting to devise different programmes tailored
to their needs. This could be pushed further by deliberately bringing
together diplomats from countries with very antagonistic approaches,
e.g. least developed tropical countries and OECD countries of
some size. In a quasi-academic environment such diplomats could
for once speak freely and, after having done so, seek ways of
solving their differences without having to consider narrow national
interests.
<H4><B>Briefs</B></H4>

<P>
National briefs
<P>
When preparing for any type of environmental negotiation, each
country has of course to prepare a national brief. This brief
will contain as precise as possible an assessment of the country's
ecological situation, of the causes of degradation and damage,
of the type of action required and the forseeable cost of preventing
further damage and remedy existing degradation. It will then consider
how the required action can be exercised. In the case of the environment
beyond the limits State jurisdiction, any action that can be expected
to be effective will have to be multilateral. In closed or nearly
closed regional environments such as the Mediterranean, considerable
useful
<P>
action can be taken by the regional countries. Regarding global
issues, only the combined efforts of the international community
as a whole can bring remedy. This means that national briefs must
assess the manner in which alliances could be forged to promote
common causes and defeat negative policies of others. Sub-briefs
must be prepared for the requisite preliminary bilateral and multilateral
contacts aiming at building up the necessary alliances.
<P>
Let's take the extreme case of the Maldives. Their very physical
survival is menaced by the expected rise of the sea level as a
result of the global warming process. The only remedy available
to the country itself would be the building of dykes to protect
their islands from being flooded into extinction. Such remedial
action is clearly beyond the means of the country. Thus the national
brief would have to stress the need of strong measures to slow
down and possibly reverse global warming with a view to delaying
and possibly even preventing the previsible catastrophe. Allies
would have to be sought among countries with similar plights such
as Bangladesh and the Netherlands. Together such particularly
menaced countries might conceivably persuade a larger group of
others that it would be cheaper for the international community
in the long run to slow down, stop and reverse global warming
than to face the exorbitant costs of remedial action once the
sea level starts to rise significantly.
<P>
Group briefs
<P>
In environmental matters the traditional groups, mainly based
on geography, will often not have a common interest. If we take
Africa, its landlocked countries are not affected by the rising
of the sea level. Only adverse effects of global warming on their
climate would awaken their concern with the phenomenon. Thus new
alliances, cutting accross traditional groupings and whose members
may be spread far apart over the globe are likely to emerge. To
be able to properly influence the outcome of global negotiations,
such groups will have to consider the likely attitude of other
groups and the kind of deals that might induce them to accept
compromises they would otherwise
<P>
reject. Such alliances are already in evidence as the Rio Conference
approaches and preparatory work progresses. But one wonders whether
this evolution is always clearly understood and assessed. Let's
just consider a few likely groups whose common interest is strongly
affected by global issues:
<P>
a. Countries with tropical forests: All of them are over-exploiting
these forests and in many the forests will disappear in the near
future. These countries are asked to cut down or even forgo exploitation
in the interests of humanity, which needs those &quot;global lungs&quot;
to prevent further accumulation of carbon dioxide and possibly
reduce the atmospheric content of this gas in the long run. These
countries feel that they are in a strong position to exact compensation
from the rest of the world and particularly the rich countries.
They tend to overlook the fact that the destruction of their forests
is an ecological desaster for themselves and their own population
as well and represents in many cases the loss of one of the country's
major sources of income.
<P>
b. Archipelagos and continental countries with low coastal
<P>
areas, especially if these are heavily populated, have a vital
<P>
interest in fighting global warming and the consequent rise of
<P>
sea levels. Some such countries are quite rich while others
<P>
are among the poorest of the world. But the group cannot
<P>
produce remedial action on its own. It must persuade all
<P>
other nations that the effects of global warming will be
<P>
generally more detrimental than helpful. In so doing the
<P>
group must realise that certain regions of the globe might
<P>
actually benefit from global warming and that the countries
<P>
situated there may be aware of this or will certainly realise
<P>
the fact in the very near future.
<P>
c. Countries menaced by desertification may or may not derive
some benefit from global warming. In most cases, desertification
is likely to be accelerated and such countries would be natural
allies of group (b). The others are likely to form a separate
group asking for consideration of the economic impact for them
of forgoing possible benefits of global warming.
<P>
d. A number of countries, both among the most developed (USA)
and those embarking on forced development (China) are reticent
to fight global warming. They do not feel that it would affect
them very adversely, wherea the cost of measures to reduce production
of carbon dioxide and sulphurous gases by their often oldfashioned
industrial complexes are staggering. Some of the countries in
this group may be able to make a case for obtaining economic compensation
for undertaking remedial action. Others, especially the USA, clearly
cannot do so.
<P>
So far we have considered alliances that are likely to be stable.
But there will be others that will only form occasionally around
a specific issue like the conservation an protection of fishing
grounds, whereas their members may very much disagree on others.
Developing countries are claiming that much of the emissions which
are causing global warming are the result of early industrialisation
processes in Europe and North America, at a time when they themselves
had no industries whatsoever and were mostly under-populated.
As a result they feel that industrialised countries should first
pay for the damage they did in the past before asking for economic
sacrifices by the developing world. But in matters of conserving
tropical forests or preventing global warming these same developing
countries are often far from united.
<H4><B>The negotiating process</B></H4>

<P>
The overall approach
<P>
Regulating the environmental situation beyond the limits of national
jurisdiction is a job that can only be tackled collectively. Thus
all countries concerned must seek solutions that they can accept
together. This means that only the package approach used initially
at the Law of the Sea Conference can be conducive to positive
results. Consequently, regulations must be adopted as a whole
and by consensus, so that each individual State and each group
of States with a special interest has a stake in their being actually
observed.
<P>
Stages of negotiation
<P>
Experience of the last few years shows that there is much merit
in having environmental issues identified for regulation discussed
at a preliminary meeting of expert scientists. Their findings
help environmental diplomats to identify those points where the
present state of the art allows precise conclusions and projections
and those where a degree of uncertainty or even wide divergence
among opinions still exist. In this last case it may be preferable
to postpone the drafting of rules until more certainty has been
achieved, as negotiators will inevitably exploit divergent scientific
conclusions in order to pick out the ones which favour their country's
or their group of countries' position.
<P>
The preparation of the Rio Conference shows us that a meeting
of plenipotentiaries empowered to sign a convention should be
presented with drafts that enjoy wide consensus achieved in earlier
discussions at expert level. In this context we mean by &quot;experts&quot;
diplomats rather than scientists. These diplomats would be the
ones who have undergone special training and briefing before tackling
their task, whereas the plenipotentiaries at the final conference
may be more inclined to consider national political and economic
<P>
interests rather than the future of humanity as a whole. What
negotiating may have to be left to the final conference would
be the conciliation of powerful group interests that may imply
concessions that diplomatic experts at preparatory meetings were
in no position to make.
<P>
Especially because of the last point mentioned, the final conference
should be composed of delegations enjoying full powers to adopt
decisions with far-reaching effects for their country. This may
mean that senior decision-makers and even heads of State or government
would have to attend. Moreover they should be made aware of the
need of having gone through sufficient consultation and concertation
processes at home to be able to make instant decisions which would
have a good chance of being ratified by the competent organs in
their country.
<H4><B>Drafting of treaties</B></H4>

<P>
Substantive clauses
<P>
Such clauses must be clear and unequivocal. Differences cannot
be allowed to be overcome by adopting wordings that can be interpreted
by each side according to its own views and preferences. Where
&quot;soft law&quot; is stated it must be done in such a manner
as to ensure that States will actually have to do their utmost
to implement its exhortations and cannot get away with claiming
that their economic situation or other circumstances prevent them
from taking any meaningful action.
<P>
Particular care must be given to ensure that versions in different
languages actually say the same thing. Evasive action by relying
on divergent interpretations based on a lack of concordance of
treaty texts must be effectively prevented.
<P>
The texts adopted by the final conference must be definitive and
complete. The practice followed by the Law of the Sea Conference
which gave the drafting committee a mandate to review certain
clauses should not be followed. The issues at hand when dealing
with the global environment are of such momentous importance that
many countries would be only too happy to seize the pretext of
a drafting committee having gone beyond its mandate to go back
on their consent. And this of course would in most cases make
the whole attempt at regulation useless.
<P>
Only reservations discussed and approved by the final conference
should be permitted and participating States should openly undertake
not to seek to dilute their undertaking by means of additional
reservations or so-called interpretative statements. The convention
should clearly state that such reservations and statements will
be without effect.
<P>
Dealing with disputes
<P>
Problems that must be settled may consist of bona-fide difficulties
in interpreting certain clauses inspite of careful drafting, or
they may arise out of conflicts of interests which are not rooted
in the text of the treaty as such. Especially in the last case,
much freedom should be available to parties to the conflict for
attempting to settle it by negotiations and other consensual means.
It is less clear whether allowance should be made for agreements,
where a conflict has been finally decided, to amend the content
of this decision, as this may give rise to new problems and controversies.
<P>
Because rules governing the global environment or the environment
of a specific region can only work when all countries concerned
abide by them, conventions setting up such rules must provide
for a compulsory way of settling disputes if all other attempts
at solving them have failed. Moreover provision must be made for
enforcement should one of the parties concerned refuse to abide
by the compulsory settlement.
<P>
Entry into force
<P>
Countries which are not happy with the final outcome of a negotiation
dealing with the global environment may be tempted to delay ratification
or accession in order not to have to implement clauses they dislike.
Such attitudes are much in evidence as reagrds the Law of the
Sea Convention. It might be useful therefore to attempt to introduce
clauses in treaties dealing with the environment beyond the limits
of State jurisdiction which provide for provisional implementation
pending ratification or accession. In this manner all countries
concerned would have to begin with the implementation of at least
the essential clauses of the treaty, however long they delay the
constitutional steps leading to full expression of consent to
be bound.
<H4><B>Concluding remarks</B></H4>

<P>
More even than when attending meetings of collective organs of
international institutions, State representatives negotiating
rules for the protection of the environment beyond the limits
of national jurisdiction are in fact participants in a community
effort. All national and group interests must be subordinated
to the overall purpose of the negotiation and interpreted in that
light. This, for many diplomats, will constitute a considerable
departure from attitudes they are accustomed to and for which
indeed they may have been specifically trained. But only the full
realisation and conscious adoption of the required attitude will
allow any significant progress in adopting rules that preserve
the global environment for future generations.
<P>
In order to produce the kind of diplomat required for environmental
negotiations curricula for training and re-training diplomats
at national and regional levels must be reviewed. A habit must
be generated to consider the common interest before examining
in what way national interests can be made to fit into it. This,
to some extent, is quite a reversal of traditional attitudes.
But as the world shrinks, multilateral diplomacy will ever more
resemble parliamentary deliberations at the national level.
<P>
Very small and/or poor countries face a special plight when entering
important environmental negotiating processes. They cannot afford
to use the sort of experts that are found in delegations of larger
countries, and indeed such experts may not be available to them
even at home. The only remedy to their plight appears to be a
sharing of resources. Small countries with similar problems, e.g.
small island States, could share the same experts and thus have
access to the kind of knowledge easily available to bigger delegations.
<A NAME="mark3"></A><HR>

<H3><B>DISCUSSION</B></H3>

<P>
<B>Mr. Micallef</B> suggested that in addition to legal and scientific
knowledge the environmental diplomat should also have a sound
knowledge of the workings of his country's administrative processes
in order to be credible. This means that the diplomat should have
had a long exposure to those processes.
<P>
<B>The Chairman</B> wondered if managerial knowledge might help
in this regard.
<P>
<B>Dr. Pernetta</B> pointed out the difficulties of getting sound
scientific advice. In his view even the International Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC) is flawed by the fact that scientists sitting
on it are government appointees and thus not free to voice scientific
views which clash with government policies. Moreover scientists
hardly ever agree fully on the scientific interpretations of a
phenomenon. Their advice should therefore be considered in the
light of these shortcomings. In the case of small countries not
only the diplomats but also the experts must have a broad knowledge
as specialists in a number of fields may not be available. It
is regrettable in this regard that the Alliance of Small Island
States is content to be a pressure group. It should consider setting
up a scientific secretariat able to properly brief its various
members.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mifsud Bonnici</B> noted that environmental diplomacy may
already be an obsolete notion, as current emphasis is on combining
environmental and development issues.
<P>
<B>Professor Attard</B> wondered what the alternative to government-appointed
scientists on the IPCC would be. States will only act on advice
proffered if their governments are involved. Even when acting
only as a pressure group, the Alliance of Small Island States
has managed to exert much more influence than the combined weight
of its members would normally warrant. As regards experts working
for small delegations, one must realise that there are already
firms and other entities which simultaneously advise a considerable
number of delegations, as a result of which they may influence
the outcome of a negotiation more than might be acceptable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Micallef</B> felt that good relations between the administrations
in charge of environmental matters and the foreign service would
be a considerable asset.
<P>
<B>Professor Birnie</B> wondered whether instead of concentrating
on the training of diplomats one should not consider more urgently
the provision of diplomatic knowledge to the numerous officials
of technically competent ministries which tend to lead delegations
to international conferences on their own.
<P>
<B>Professor Kappeler</B> noted that this issue has already been
given a lot of consideration by training institutions, some of
which have admitted officials from ministries very active in external
relations to their regular training courses. Another possibility
is the organisation of short ad hoc training courses tailored
to the needs of individual ministries.
<P>
<B>Professor Attard</B> noted that when the moment comes to negotiate
issues of key importance for States, diplomats tend always to
replace experts from other administrations who might previously
have attended discussions.

<P>
<B>Subject</B>: Adoption of a preliminary report with conclusions
and closing of the Colloquium
<P>
The Chairman guided participants through the draft document which
had been circulated to them. A number of amendments were proposed
and accepted. As time did not suffice, the Chairman suggested
that participants submit such further amendments as they might
wish to suggest in writing. For this purpose the revised document
was circulated after the end of the Colloquium.
<P>
The Chairman then welcomed Dr. Stanley Zammit, Parliamentary Secretary
for the Environment and invited him to deliver the closing speech.
<A NAME="mark1"></A><HR>

<H3><B>CLOSING SPEECH BY THE PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY IN THE MINISTRY
OF THE ENVIRONMENT, THE HON.DR. STANLEY ZAMMIT M.D, M.P.</B></H3>

<P>
Mr. Chairman, distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen. I
have been informed of and followed with great interest the deliberations
made during this colloquium and I am indeed, to say the least,
surprised with certain data which your good work has unfolded.
Information of this nature is the one which has set the world
community to think about our future as well as that of generations
to come.
<P>
A marked difference is easily noticeable from the results of colloquia
such as this and other international fora where the representative
delegates are more often than not faced with the laborious task
of reaching compromises with the obvious resultant effects. In
meetings such as this, however, the personal views of the participants
have a key role and do in fact provide the opportunity to discuss
issues which are not on the agenda of international meetings.
This forum again departs from the necessary formalities of international
conventions by successfully hosting a dialogue between the scientist
and the drafter. The scientist who, alarmed by the findings of
certain data and who logically expects an immediate action to
halt further harm to the environment, is more often than not overwhelmed
by the number of hurdles which obstruct his path: development,
politics, negotiations and funding among many others. Indeed the
dangers unfolded by the scientist must necessarily be given a
meaning by enacting legislation which would create sanctions against
the promoting of such dangers. The drafter's role then becomes
indispensable. He is the representative, the lawyer and the negotiator
of his country faced with various issues which present themselves
as hurdles to the creation of a legally binding instrument, possibly
the same obstacles faced by the technical person whose preoccupations
would have, by then, reached unprecedented dimensions.
<P>
We all know and understand the difficulties present in the creation
of international treaties and it comes as no surprise that a number
of these instruments are devoid of any sanctions against an offending
party. However at this late hour, should we not be less concerned
about issues of sovereignty beyond the areas of national jurisdiction?
Recent history of mankind has proved beyond any doubt that activities
within areas of national jurisdiction are the main source of damage
to the environment of those extraterritorial spaces. That which
occurs within the areas of national domain and which is harmful
to the environment without, is of common concern of mankind a
phrase which has bounced back and forth within the four walls
of this same venue. In UNEP's Meeting of Senior Government Officials
Expert in Environmental Law held in Rio de Janeiro in October/November,
1991, some of the delegates put forward a proposal to include
in UNEP's programme for this decade, the development of legislation
against environmental crime.
<P>
The Kuwaiti oil wells set on fire before the withdrawal of Iraqi
troops and the deliberate spillage of oil in the Gulf were all
too recent examples of voluntary damage to the environment which
inspired, indeed motivated, this proposal. I was informed however,
that other delegations turned down this idea on the basis that
UNEP should not be concerned with the laws of war and that other
remedies exist for such eventualities. If I may be allowed to
speak with the same frankness as you have been doing in these
past two days, I do not share the same opinion on the matter and
I do believe that the time is ripe to move towards the concept
of accountability a concept which relies heavily on the work of
the diplomat for its success, for it will have to break the old
traditions of sovereignty in some degree or other.
<P>
You have been discussing the Legal Protection of the Environment
Beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction and it results quite
clearly that the protection of the environment immediately addresses
the issue of effectiveness or otherwise of present legislation.
But, to borrow a few lines from our mutual friend Dr. Tolba, there
is a tendency to measure success in the field of environmental
law more in terms of legal acts than in terms of actually improving
the environment. The most basic question in this regard was whether
the situation on the ground was better now or at least likely
to be better than it was before the signing of a convention. Dr.
Tolba was quoted as saying in the Rio Conference that in the last
Governing Council of UNEP he was forced to conclude that &quot;the
efficiency and effectiveness of environmental legal regulations
leaves much to be desired&quot;. Where does this take us, ladies
and gentlemen? I must admit that I am happy to hear of an alternative
which could implement the work achieved to date. I say &quot;implement&quot;
because I believe that all that has been achieved to date, with
all its merits and demerits, should not go to waste. It is not
a matter of starting afresh but rather of finding other methods
of enhancement.
<P>
You have dealt with the subject of environmental diplomacy an
alternative which is of recent origin and which I believe to be
an indispensable tool for the creation of mechanisms for the protection
of the environment beyond the areas of national jurisdiction.
This meeting has given due recognition of the need to resort to
this new area. The environmental diplomat must be trained to bring
together the various facets involved not only in negotiating treaties
of environmental nature but also be instrumental in implementing
notions of accountability of States towards environmental issues.
<P>
In bringing an end to this colloquium, may I thank you for having
devoted so much of your precious time to bring forward your knowledge
and experience.
<P>
As one of the speakers stated, a good lawyer always starts by
a quoting an excerpt from some literature. Well, I am not a lawyer,
but I will quote Tennyson who said in one of his works that &quot;the
old order do the change the yielding place to new&quot;. If this
were a fact in Tennyson's time then it is a perplexing uncertainty
today and should commit the world community to strive in order
to save the environment for the future generations.
<P>
Ladies and Gentlemen, I bring this meeting to an end and I thank
you again for your valuable endeavour.
<P>
After the speech the Chairman thanked Dr. Zammit in the name of
the participants. He also congratulated and thanked the latter
for the important work they did over the two days of the Colloquium.

<H3><B>SUMMARY REPORT AND CONCLUSIONS</B></H3>

<P>
The Colloquium was convened by the Mediterranean Academy of Diplomatic
Studies and co-sponsored by the Graduate Institute of International
Studies in Geneva. The organiser and convenor was David J. Attard,
UNEP Professor of Environmental Diplomacy at the Academy.
<P>
The Colloquium considered the following agenda:
<P>
1. Which are the spaces beyond national jurisdiction?
<P>
2. Scientific aspects of environmental degradation and remedies
for it.
<P>
3. The current status of the law relating to environmental protection
in general and in the Mediterranean in particular.
<P>
4. Strategies likely to produce international regimes and mechanisms
for the future.
<P>
5. The role of diplomacy in implementing effective legal environmental
protection.
<P>
The Colloquium noted that most environmental processes transcend
the distinction between national spaces and areas beyond national
jurisdiction, both as regards their causes and their effects.
The relevance of the distinction only lies in the fact that States
still are attached to the concept of national sovereignty and
therefore tend to conduct their diplomacy accordingly. As any
remedies against environmental damage must be decided and implemented
by States, and as most damaging events have their source on State
territory, the
<P>
delimitation between the latter and spaces beyond State jurisdiction
still matters.
<P>
Understanding environmental processes is a multi-disciplinary
affair which involves many scientific disciplines. Dealing with
prevention and remedy of degradation is essentially the business
of diplomats, national decision-makers and officials and international
institutions which mainly function as providers of data, monitors,
fora and advisers. Dealing with environmental issues therefore
can only make sense when following a holistic approach, which
means communication and mutual understanding of all involved.
<P>
Scientific understanding of environmental processes progresses
rapidly. This does not mean that predictions regarding the outcome
of such processes and their interaction are easy. Often more knowledge
only leads to the need for more research. But even fully understood
phenomena can produce diverse results depending on time and location.
The valuation of possible outcomes is obviously a subjective matter
which depends on the organ or even individual entrusted with it,
its priorities and its general outlook, and its regard for the
cautionary principle.
<P>
Although there is no comprehensive legal coverage of environmental
issues, there is a great number of more or less sectoral or even
specific regulations, some in the form of legal obligations undertaken
pursuant to a treaty, others adopted as resolutions and recommendations
of a persuasive nature. One reason for this situation is that
the urgency of dealing with such problems as climate change and
preservation of the ozone layer is such that immediate action
is required which cannot wait until the complex process of negotiating
global regulations can be completed.
<P>
The Colloquium noted with concern that whereas States are often
willing to negotiate and sign treaties, they do not always implement
them, both as regards legal and administrative action and providing
the necessary financial means. One can even note an accumulation
of regimes with similar or even overlapping aims none of which
results in much practical action being undertaken by those concerned.
<P>
As in the case of regulations there is equally a plethora of institutions
dealing with environmental matters both at national and international
levels. The
<P>
Colloquium noted that very often these institutions do not communicate
properly or even ignore each other deliberately. Very often lack
of communication and coordination at international level has its
source in the same lack of communication at national levels, as
a result of which different institutions get different signals
from the same countries.
<P>
In the Mediterranean region, the Barcelona Convention System constitutes
a framework of comprehensive cooperation between coastal States.
Whereas the Convention only concerns itself with the waters of
the Mediterranean, several Protocols are both more precise and
broader in territorial scope, concerning themselves with land-based
sources of pollution as well as with their impact on the sea.
Under the Barcelona Treaty system progress appears to have been
made in stressing the persuasive aspect of the law and the public
interest aspect of actions undertaken, wherein the concept of
public trust could be usefully employed. The Mediterranean Action
Plan has contributed a lot to help individual countries take the
required steps to implement their treaty obligations. This has
lately been facilitated by the availability of funds from the
World Bank and the European Development Bank.
<P>
The Colloquium was provided with detailed information on the initiatives
Malta has undertaken at the United Nations to promote strategies
concerned with global environmental protection. It supports the
proposal that a Group of eminent specialists, including scientists,
consider the requirements for the proper protection of the environment
beyond national jurisdiction and in areas under partial State
control and to propose possible strategies and institutional arrangements
to meet these requirements. The Colloquium also noted with interest
the proposal of Malta's Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of
Foreign Affairs to transform the role of the UN Trusteeship Council
into that of a Guardian of the &quot;Global Commons&quot; for
present and future generations. Although its realisation is likely
to raise many problems, this proposal should be further studied,
among other possible institutional arrangements.
<P>
The Colloquium discussed the specific characteristics of environmental
diplomacy and of the diplomats required for the purpose. It noted
the
<P>
importance of proper understanding of scientific issues and of
proper briefing by all national agencies concerned. It also noted
that environmental negotiations are difficult because overall
consensus must be achieved without prejudicing the clarity and
effectiveness of regulations adopted. A greater sense of solidarity
of mankind is required in this context, in order not to allow
strictly national interests to block discussions.
<P>
As regards strategies, the Colloquium identified the following
salient issues:
<P>
1. Identification of spaces, resources and activities under limited
national jurisdiction or beyond it.
<P>
2. Identification of environmental problems of such spaces, resources
and activities.
<P>
3. Assessment of the adequacy of the present international legal
agreements to deal with the environmental problems thus identified.
<P>
4. Formulation of proposals for legal and institutional arrangements
such as changing the mandate of the UN Trusteeship Council, elaboration
of new overall conventions etc.
<P>
The Colloquium also adopted the following conclusions:
<P>
1. The Colloquium supports the idea that environmental problems
of areas beyond national jurisdiction be examined within the United
Nations framework at a high level. It supports the proposal made
by Malta to appoint a Group of eminently competent persons for
this purpose and suggests the following:
<P>
a. The persons should be selected through the Executive Director
of UNEP and in consultation with the executive heads of all other
specialised institutions and agencies
<P>
concerned. They should be chosen on account of their high level
of expertise in the various relevant scientific and other areas
involved.
<P>
b. The Group should as a first step gather all relevant scientific
information from the various specialised institutions and agencies
able to provide this. For this purpose, it could establish sub-committees.
On the basis of the data thus accumulated, the Group should then
consider strategies and the legal and institutional framework
for their implementation.
<P>
c. Due regard should be paid to existing legal regimes and institutions
and the manner in which they might be used to implement the strategies
identified. Insofar as any need for additional UN structures may
be ascertained, the Maltese proposal that the Trusteeship Council
assume responsibility for the preservation of the &quot;Global
Commons&quot; for present and future generations should be given
due consideration.
<P>
2. The Colloquium considered the proposal made by the Deputy Prime
Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of Malta to enhance the
role of the UN General Assembly as regards the safeguarding of
the &quot;Global Commons&quot; for present and future generations
and his suggestion to entrust that task to the UN Trusteeship
Council. While aware of the serious difficulties involved in amending
the UN Charter, the Colloquium felt that the proposal merits further
consideration and it welcomed the suggestion that the Mediterranean
Academy of Diplomatic Studies be asked to prepare a detailed study
of it. <HR>

<H2><B>PREFACE</B></H2>

<P>
Fred TANNER and James A. SCHEAR<HR>

<P>
The Mediterranean has long been a venue for tensions and conflicts.
Located on the crossroads between Europe, the Middle East and
Africa, the various subregions of the Mediterranean have been
prone not only to pressures created by Cold-War era confrontations
but also to the disruptive effects of unresolved local disputes,
most notably between Israel and her Arab neighbors. Though the
ebbing of the East-West conflict has greatly improved Mediterranean
security, regional disputes still abound and a wide array of non-military
issues - such as cross-border migrations, natural resource management,
and maritime policing issues - pose challenges that require urgent
attention. Fortunately, in recent years, the region has experienced
an upsurge of diplomatic activity aimed at promoting measures
of stability, cooperation and conflict resolution.
<P>
The factors underlying this search for greater cooperation are
diverse. More and more states, it would appear, have reached the
judgment that the security hazards they face cannot be solved
unilaterally or through military means alone. The penalties of
non-cooperation also are becoming more apparent. As technology
spreads, the hazards of uncontrolled weapons proliferation grow
ever more acute, requiring collective solutions. In the economic
sphere, development at the national level is increasingly dependent
upon inter-state cooperation and integration into the global economy.
The difficult question, clearly, is how to best forge cooperation
in matters of security while also preserving vital interests,
national independence and cultural identity.
<P>
One of the most hopeful developments in recent years has been
the advent of direct dialogue between Israel, the Palestinians,
and Arab states on the terms of a comprehensive peace settlement.
This dialogue, which has survived continuing violence and occasional
set-backs, has opened up a new pathway for multilateral discussions
on arms control and regional security - the so-called ACRS process.
In tandem with progress on the political side, these deliberations
could in time lead to the adoption of region-wide arms limitation
and confidence-building measures (CBMs) involving Israel and the
Arab states, including the Maghreb countries. Correspondingly,
there is growing interest in global disarmament regimes, such
as the treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)
and the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). Participation in these
regimes has far-reaching implications for states in terms of treaty
implementation, verification and safeguarding activity.
<P>
Thus, it would appear that practical steps toward arms control
and confidence-building will provide an important part of any
larger framework for regional security in the Mediterranean. Clearly,
such measures should not be viewed as a panacea for all types
of regional insecurities, and they must be carefully adjusted
to the pace of efforts aimed at settling the political and social
dimensions of ongoing conflicts. Yet, the very process of working
together on security problems may help to generate a sense of
common purpose among states and peoples and thereby improve the
climate in which constructive political change becomes possible.
<P>
The Mediterranean, in sum, is a promising arena for new forms
of multilateral security cooperation. With the decline of the
Cold-War era tensions, such collaborative activity is becoming
more possible; but the full potential of new cooperative ventures
remains to be fully explored, and the persistence of security
challenges at the regional level suggests that no one can take
future cooperation for granted.
<P>
To examine current security trends and the prospects for multilateral
cooperation in this difficult area, the Mediterranean Academy
of Diplomatic Studies and the Henry L. Stimson Center sponsored
a two-day conference on &quot;Arms Control, Confidence-Building
and Security Cooperation in the Mediterranean, North Africa and
the Middle East,&quot; on 24-26 June 1994, in Malta. We were very
fortunate that over thirty high level participants from governments,
international organizations and the academic community were able
to attend the meeting. A number of these individuals made presentations
at the conference and their papers are included in this volume.
<P>
The participants addressed the following categories of topics:
<UL>
<LI>Security trends in the Mediterranean;
<LI>Global and regional dimensions of arms control and disarmament;
<LI>Confidence-building measures in regional security; and
<LI>Multilateral cooperation in the maritime domaine and in key-non
military areas.
</UL>

<P>
The order of papers published in this volume has been arranged
according to these categories.
<P>
In closing, we wish to offer our sincere thanks to a number of
organizations that supported the conference and this publication.
They include the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Malta, the Foundation
for International Studies, University of Malta, the American Center,
the Association des Etudes Internationales, Tunisia, and the Directorate
of Development Cooperation and Humanitarian Aid of the Swiss Ministry
of Foreign Affairs. On the Stimson Center side, support for the
conference was provided by the Carnegie Corporation of New York,
the W. Alton Jones Foundation, the Rockfeller Foundation and the
Rockfeller Brothers Fund.

<H2>OPENING ADDRESS </H2>

<P>
<B>Professor Guido DE MARCO</B>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister and
<P>
Minister of Foreign Affairs, Malta<HR>

<P>
Mr. Chairman, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen
<P>
The end of the Cold War left the Mediterranean region facing a
multitude of problems and challenges, ranging from economic and
social disparities to pollution of the environment, arms proliferation
and conflicts, and the escalation of nationalism and extremism
in all its manifestations. Insecurity and instability are the
net result of this situation.
<P>
On the southern shores of the Mediterranean, the area stretching
from North Africa to the Middle East, the consequence of economic
problems and population explosion contribute to exacerbate an
already difficult socio-political situation. In part, this is
the result of the disequilibrium between the levels of development
on the northern and southern shores.
<P>
Socio-economic tensions coupled with unstable political systems
and the specificity of the historical and cultural condition of
access to modernity affect the domestic situation in many countries
and form a fertile ground for the development of religious extremism.
In particular, the growing influence of Islamic fundamentalism
in some countries lying on and around the southern shores of the
Mediterranean is perceived as a destabilizing factor and as a
potential threat to regional security. In addition to that, the
continued armed forces build-up in the area continues at alarming
levels.
<P>
These and other issues are affecting, directly or indirectly,
all countries in the Mediterranean region and even beyond. By
now, the need to meet the challenges posed in the area through
the concentrated efforts of all interested parties has been recognized,
as past and recent attempts at generating a dialogue on issues
of common concerns clearly demonstrate. The dramatic changes that
took place in the international political and
<P>
security environment in the aftermath of the Cold War and the
recent positive developments occurring in the Middle East are
adding momentum to the last spate of initiatives concerned with
security, stability and cooperation in the region.
<P>
It is in this context that Malta welcomes the convening of this
international workshop on ''Arms Control, Confidence-Building
and Security Cooperation in the Mediterranean, North Africa and
the Middle East'', co-organised by the Henry L. Stimson Centre,
USA, and the Mediterranean Academy of Diplomatic Studies at the
University of Malta.
<P>
This meeting convenes at the right time. The Middle East Peace
Process has entered a dynamic phase while European states start
realising that with the end of the Cold War, events in the Middle
East, North Africa and the Mediterranean are of direct significance
to their security.
<P>
A peace process is made up by a bilateral and multilateral track.
Both are addressing in one way or another questions of security
cooperation, confidence-building and arms control.
<P>
The multilateral talks on Arms Control and Regional Security have
seen considerable progress over the last few months, due of course
to the breakthrough in bilateral negotiations between Israel and
the Palestinians as well as Israel and Jordan.
<P>
They deal with a very wide scope ranging from confidence-building
measures to the control of conventional armament and weapons of
mass destruction, including a Nuclear Weapon Free Zone for the
Middle East. However, this important agenda on regional security
cooperation is influenced by the global arms control process,
which is currently in a crucial stage:
<P>
The Chemical Weapon Convention, which has already more than 160
signatories may enter into force by January 1995. This agreement
represents an important step for security in the Middle East,
North Africa
<P>
and the Mediterranean. We should not forget that chemical weapons
have been used extensively during the first Gulf War.
<P>
The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty will expire next year if
not extended. The debate about an extension of the NPT has already
begun. The NPT plays an important role in the Middle East Peace
Process, as it is considered by some states as a primary instrument
to arrive at a Nuclear Weapon Free Zone in the region.
<P>
Other important items of the global arms control agenda include
negotiations for a Comprehensive Test Ban and a convention banning
further production of nuclear weapons-grade material.
<P>
Western security institutions such as NATO and the WEU have begun
to pay more attention to the Mediterranean region. Conflicts affecting
the Southern flank in the Balkans and the Caucasus have redirected
the attention of the Alliance from a purely East-West perspective.
Arrangements of soft security cooperation in the context of Partnership
for Peace extend today over parts of the Balkan and into Central
Asia.
<P>
Co-operative efforts to reduce the risk of armed conflict in the
region have to pursue a comprehensive approach. Regional and sub-regional
arms races can only be successfully addressed in a co-operative
fashion only.
<P>
Furthermore, confidence-building measures cannot take place in
a vacuum; they must be part of a comprehensive process. In times
when non-military risks have climbed the agenda of national security
policies, CBMs must be accompanied by co-operative measures in
the political, economic and environmental fields.
<P>
The experience gained by the Conference on Security and Cooperation
in Europe (CSCE) may be useful for regional security cooperation,
as it can serve as a model. Indeed, achievements of confidence-building
regimes at the end of the Cold War period in Europe have inspired
efforts in many other parts of the world.
<P>
However, we should not succumb to the belief that we can simply
transfer the CSCE to other regions. In Europe, for instance, confidence-building
had as its primary objective to stabilise the East-West relations,
whereas in the Middle East the building of confidence should make
the peaceful change in the region more palatable to all parties.
<P>
It is with this scenario in mind that we have to examine the concept
of Confidence Building Measures in the Mediterranean.
<P>
In the first place we have to acknowledge that the arms escalation
in the region is ever present; an escalation which goes beyond
the conventional weaponry.
<P>
Many of the countries on the southern flank own tactical ballistic
missiles. Chemical and bacteriological weapons if further developed,
can achieve strategic objectives in the region as to endanger
its stability. The proliferation of arms of mass destruction will
certainly affect the security situation in the region. But it
will be a mistake to evaluate the security situation in the Mediterranean
on strictly military terms. The socio-economic situation in the
Mediterranean is the main source of anxiety. Unemployment is in
the vertical. In less than thirty years the population in the
North Africa and the Middle East has grown by 118% as compared
to the 8% forecast for Europe. In North Africa and in the Middle
East the population will grow from 250 million to almost half
a billion.
<P>
It is relevant today that albeit with some delay, the linkage
between security in Europe and security in the Mediterranean has
been fully realised.
<P>
The NATO Summit of January 1994 declared that ''We reiterate our
conviction that security in Europe is greatly affected by security
in the Mediterranean. We strongly welcome the agreements recently
concluded in the Middle East Peace Process which offer a historic
opportunity for a peaceful and lasting settlement in the area.
This much awaited breakthrough has had a positive impact on the
overall situations in the Mediterranean, thus opening the way
to consider measures to promote
<P>
dialogue, understanding and confidence building between the countries
in the region. We direct the Council in the permanent session
to continue to review the overall situation, and we encourage
all effort conducive to strengthening regional stability.''
<P>
At this very moment the Corfu Summit is discussing the Mediterranean.
As president Klepsch said three hours ago ''The Greek Presidency's
proposal for a new common Mediterranean policy is a further positive
element in the efforts to achieve stability and peace. The European
Parliament supports this proposal for the creation of a Mediterranean
forum embracing all the member states of the Union and the Mediterranean
countries''.
<P>
Malta can look with satisfaction at seeing how high the Mediterranean
stands in the international agenda. For it was Malta which brought
about the realisation of the Mediterranean Basket in the Helsinki
Summit I.
<P>
We have also proposed and Helsinki Summit II made it its own that
the CSCE becomes the regional arrangement for peace-keeping in
the region in terms of Chapter VIII of the Charter of the United
Nations. A link was created between security in the CSCE region
with the global concept of security in terms of the United Nations
Charter.
<P>
Malta has sponsored the CSCM proposal and to my knowledge has
been the only country in the region to pass a resolution to that
effect by a unanimous vote of the House of Representatives.
<P>
Malta's proposal for a Council of the Mediterranean is receiving
a wide support. In a report by Spanish Parliamentarian Senior
R. de Rato in the Sub-Committee on the Southern Region to the
North Atlantic Assembly, a detailed analysis of Malta's proposal
of the Mediterranean was made. The rapporteur stated that ''realisation
of a CSCM is of course not for tomorrow; a number of NATO nations
themselves are not interested for reasons of feasibility or of
interest with the Middle East peace process or because of concerns
that Naval Arms Control measure would hamper operational flexibility.
Therefore our deliberations should take into account
<P>
other options. One variation has been put forward by Malta, by
way of a Council of the Mediterranean whereby through non rigid
arrangements one can have a setting for the development of a common
understanding''.
<P>
We know that a Gyminck is to take place in Alexandria early July
to discuss informally the Mediterranean region; a Gymnick which
is going to be attended by a limited number of countries.
<P>
We always have reservations when limitations are applied, unless
these limitations are governed by criteria of selection which
are politically sound as well as objective. They have to be clear,
transparent and logical; otherwise as I had occasion to state
when addressing last week the Western European Union Parliamentary
Assembly, the sense of exclusion may generate suspicions and create
negative reflexes.
<P>
Your presence here this evening is a confirmation of the Mediterranean
dimension in the international agenda. A dimension which requires
understanding and development of a dialogue.
<P>
If a result of this dialogue and of the confidence building measures
aligned thereto prove positive, we will succeed in getting the
countries of the region to discuss their common concerns, their
common interest and their common heritage, and we will have succeeded
in getting together the countries of the Mediterranean to discuss
their common future for the first time in history.

<H2><B>FACTORS AFFECTING MEDITERRANEAN SECURITY </B></H2>

<P>
<B>Dr. Roberto ALIBONI</B>
<P>
Director of Studies
<P>
Istituto Affari Internazionali, Rome<HR>

<P>
With the end of the Cold War, the importance of military factors
affecting security has taken a back seat to <U>non</U>-military
considerations pertaining to Western European security in the
areas beyond the Mediterranean. (i.e. North Africa and the Middle
East). This has been reflected in the growing body of literature
analyzing non-military factors affecting security and the increased
attention given to these issues by Western and European security
institutions.
<P>
This presentation aims to identify the cultural, political and
economic factors affecting security in the Mediterranean area,
and will consider their implications on policy.
<P>
<B>Cultural Factors</B> influence European security in that they
may prompt fundamental ideological antagonisms which, in turn,
give rise to an environment that is hostile and potentially aggressive
toward the West (and vice versa).
<P>
1. Since the Second World War, Western Europe has developed a
''rationalist&quot; culture which has led to the strengthening
and the enlargement of its democratic political institutions,
a strong emphasis on the respect for human and civil rights, and
the primacy of international solidarity with respect to nationalist
concerns. In the area surrounding Western Europe, however, the
end of the Cold War has been accompanied by the re-emergence of
reinforcements of &quot;romantic&quot; trends dominated by ethnic,
religious, or national values which generally lead to an adversarial
identity.
<P>
These developments may have a negative impact on the cohesion
and integration of Western Europe.
<P>
2. Western Europe and the West as a whole is considered the primary
antagonist of the identity sought in the Mediterranean area. The
nationalistic position is that of traditional Third Worldism,
that is, the West prevents or impedes the spread of modernity
(by preventing or limiting the spread of economic, technological
and scientific development). According to Islamists, on the other
hand, modernity may only be reached within the framework of indigenous
values and not through assimilation of Western culture: modernization
through imitation of the West is a trap which can only lead to
subordination.
<P>
The Islamists are more radical in their rejection of the West
than are the nationalists. The latter perceive themselves to be
on the fringe of what are essentially shared cultural values;
their goal is to assume a more central position in a culture that
is perceived as universal. Islamists, however, do not believe
that Western culture is universal and perceived their development
as being necessarily in opposition to the west.
<P>
The rise of radical Islamism (though there are also major moderate
or less radical movements) has intensified long standing anti-Western
sentiments in the regions south of the Mediterranean. The security
implications of this trend include fundamental tension which hinders
dialogue between Western countries and those of the Southern Mediterranean
area.
<P>
3. There has been an increase in immigration from the Mediterranean
area (and from Eastern Europe ) to Western Europe. Immigrants
often form ethnic communities which resist integration into the
European host culture. As this is occurring in a period of significant
demographic fragility in Europe (where the growth rate is virtually
zero in a rapidly aging population), immigration is strongly perceived
as a threat, and has led to intolerance and racism. This has resulted
in restrictive legislation on immigrants and refugees, which is
in sharp contrast to the &quot;rationalist&quot;, democratic nature
of European society and exacerbates the fundamental tension referred
to earlier.
<P>
4. These elements of tension are amplified by the mass media,
particularly because of the one-way flow of messages (images transmitted
are almost
<P>
exclusively Western and these are compounded by those of Western
tourists). On the one hand, mass media send &quot;European&quot;
images across the Mediterranean, giving rise to distortions, conflicts,
imitations, and anomie (e.g. French, Italian and Spanish coverage
of the Gulf War which was received in the Maghreb); on the other
hand, mass media bring Europeans &quot;European&quot; views of
the Southern Mediterranean, particularly of the Islamist movements,
which are generally stereotypical and negative, fuelling hostility
and mistrust toward the region.
<P>
Thus the tension felt by the South in respect to the North is
mutual. From a European point of view, the pressures of current
cultural trends are putting democratic institutions to the test,
and creating a perceived threat to the European way of life.
<P>
<B>Political factors</B> also contribute to hostility towards
the West.
<P>
1. Western Europe, as an integral part of the West, is allied
with the so-called moderate Arab regimes (i.e. those which are
cooperative at the international level). Thus it often finds itself
involved in inter-Arab rivalries. This is less of an issue than
it had been during the Cold War when such rivalries contributed
to the East-West confrontation. What is more relevant today is
that opposition groups (Islamist and others) within Arab countries
see the West as supporting what are usually authoritarian and
repressive regimes.
<P>
The situation is marked by contradictions. Should they gain power,
the most extreme Islamists would form regimes which would be at
least as repressive as the current ones, if not more so. In any
case, it is certainly true that the West neglected the issue of
democracy in Arab-Muslim countries, partly because of the pressures
of the Cold War. In light of the preceding considerations of cultural
factors contributing to tensions across the Mediterranean, it
is clear that the West's failure to support unifying democratic
elements in Arab-Muslim countries was a mistake.
<P>
&quot;Democracy&quot; is currently an important ingredient of
European policies toward the countries south of the Mediterranean.
This must be carefully addressed because it risks clashing with
the current sensitivity about identity. In any case, the democratic
ingredient of European policies is crucial, at least with respect
to those regimes or groups which are, or which claim to be, close
to the West.
<P>
2. The West and Western Europe are involved in two major crises
under way in the south of the Mediterranean: the Arab-Israeli
crisis and the Iraqi crisis. Their involvement is a source of
hostility towards the West which will persist as long as the crises
remain unresolved and even afterwards, as the resolution will
favour some groups at the expense of others. Thus the management
of these crises must be carried out so as to support those groups
which are willing to cooperate with the West and which are open
to democracy.
<P>
3. The lack of international cooperation between the European
and Arab worlds constitutes a negative political factor in trans-Mediterranean
relations. The Cold War made such cooperation difficult; the end
of the Cold War should encourage Western Europe, and particularly
the European Community, to develop a policy of cooperation with
the Arab world, and to avoid being confined to a marginal role
of indirect support or of involvement at the sub-regional level
(Maghreb). Such an European initiative would not be a &quot;duplication&quot;
within the Atlantic framework.
<P>
A significant impediment to the establishment of inter-regional
cooperation between the European Union and the Arab world is the
asymmetric level of institutionalization and cohesion of the two
sides; the absence of a solid and articulated inter-Arab cooperation
weakens the prospects of a successful policy of inter-regional
cooperation.
<P>
<B>Economic factors</B> affect European security in two major
ways.
<P>
The market income disparity among most countries in the area and
economic/social underdevelopment fuel opposition (particularly
Islamist)to Arab regimes, thus increasing instability. International
and bilateral cooperation has recently made more effort to address
these problems, launching major adjustment and restructuring programmes.
The European Community has established a new programme (the renewed
Mediterranean policy). This programme, despite an increase in
funding, remains a modest effort, considering EC interests in
this region. It is weakened by the fact that member states hesitate
to assign increased importance and resources to a common cooperation
policy as opposed to the national ones. The EC should play a greater
and more autonomous role in supporting programmes and projects
aimed at increasing employment in the short-medium term--an objective
which is less important to the restructuring and adjustment programmes
supported by the<B> IMF</B> and the <B>World Bank.</B>
<P>
International economic cooperation, however, is limited by the
severe <I>disintegration </I>and <I>fragmentation</I> of the regional
economies and by the lack of cooperation between States with extremely
unequal demographic and income distributions. The Arab-Israeli
conflict constitutes a fundamental disruption of relations between
the countries of the region.
<P>
This state of disintegration is a destabilizing factor and threat
to West European interests. It results in market fluctuations
and trade restrictions, weak infrastructures, threats to oil and
other energy supplies, and the lack of mobility of goods and people
(which contributes to migrations to Western Europe).
<P>
The progress in the current Arab-Israeli negotiations (end of
the boycott, border openings, etc.) would have a very positive
effect on international cooperation because it would restore market
continuity. In any case, intra-regional cooperation and integration
must also be increased. Attempts so far, including the Arab Maghreb
Union, have been disappointing. Furthermore, the EC has never
made serious efforts to make its cooperation policies contingent
on progress in regional cooperation. As in the political arena,
increased regional integration is necessary in the economic field
if international cooperation is to be successful.

<H2>SECURITY TRENDS IN THE MEDITERRANEAN</H2>

<H3>A Perspective from North Africa</H3>

<P>
<B>Ambassador Ahmed OUNAIS</B>
<P>
Director General of Political Affairs
<P>
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Tunisia<HR>

<P>
I was invited to present to you a North African perspective on
Security Trends in the Mediterranean. These are my personal views
and comments.
<P>
The long process that culminated in the signing of the Helsinki
Act on August lst, 1975, started with the stabilisation of the
European Region, which means the admission of all by all, within
identified and respected borders, and with mutual differences
in political systems and regimes.
<P>
What has made possible such a process of negotiations in the fields
of Security, Cooperation and Human Rights is:
<P>
1. The stability of the political map and the general commitment
not to alter it by means of violence or war; and
<P>
2. The balance of power, the shared belief that any attempt against
any party will be countered by efficient means. This <U>guarantee
</U>extends to all parties: members of the two blocs as well as
the non-aligned and neutral countries.
<P>
The structure of balanced power enables the groups of countries
to enter a deal as large as the Helsinki Act and its subsequent
confidence building measures in so many fields. Of course, stability
does not mean a freeze. Actually, the political map as it was
has changed, but a change which came from within - a change proprio
motu. Indeed, the seeds of Helsinki were tremendously portent.
<P>
The teachings of the process, as we perceived them, were designed
to build confidence on the basis of stable and secured entities.
Stable, because they enjoy mutual and global recognition and secure,
because they rely on the shared belief that aggression is actually
suicidal.
<P>
The picture in the Mediterranean today is different from the continental
Europe of the late 1960s. The unsettled conflicts in the Middle-East,
Cyprus, ex-Yugoslavia and Western Sahara are proof of the shifting
political map of the region. The stability and the structure of
security are yet to be assured: though all current conflicts are
subject to an active process of negotiations, many Mediterranean
parties feel uncertain about their full acceptance in the regional
process while mistrust continues to reign.
<P>
Besides these internal factors, the international realities, as
they appear, do not help in confidence building: the partial and
hazardous strategies, either hesitant and seemingly paralyzed
or opportunistic and discriminatory, bear a large responsibility
in the extent of instability, antagonism and allergic relationship
among some Mediterranean countries.
<P>
Disputes and claims of diverse nature - ethnic, religious - constitute
a source of concern in many places. Furthermore, the military
factor is still dominant in the current process of settlement
of these issues.
<P>
We will consider the security trends in the Mediterranean under
three headings:
<H4><B>1. The International Aspects</B></H4>

<P>
The conflicts in the Mediterranean do not originate in the East-West
confrontation; they go back to the earlier imperial or colonial
era.
<P>
The Cold War had its impact over them - fueling, delaying, freezing
- but, by nature, they take root in the chain of events of the
old world. Therefore, sequels of the past are still to be found
in today's political arena.
<P>
The challenge of the past is not insurmountable. With due respect
to the rights and claims of all nations, we can use the present
political and legal culture to address the longlasting litigations
and crises: liberty, equality, reciprocity, legality, universal
values and principles, as well as a feeling of responsibility
and dignity.
<P>
The main features of the present picture, as we perceive them,
are as follows:
<P>
a) The Colonial Dimension
<P>
Surprisingly, the Mediterranean still suffers from colonial rule
as witnessed on its west flank in Ceuta and Mellilla and on its
east flank in the territories occupied by Israel. The colonial
phenomenon is indeed redundant; the ultimate solution in these
colonial spots could not be different from other historic precedents.
Nevertheless, these are sequels of anachronistic strategies, which
heavily affect political relations among Mediterranean countries.
<P>
We, in North Africa, have experienced colonial rule under which
intruders expel the natives and occupy their land and home, as
part of the strategy devised by the rulers. The new settlers enjoy
military, economic and technical facilities which help them radically
transform the environment, including the human relationship and
political set-up: very soon the colonisers get so arrogant as
to claim political rights and national sovereignty over the land.
<P>
Though legally null and void <I>ab initio</I>, this process has
repeated itself to the point of blindness. The North African countries
do not compromise on this issue, one of the bitterest pieces of
our modem history in the Maghreb.
<P>
b) Military Occupation
<P>
Needless to say, military occupation is a sore truth of the region.
Are confidence building measures conceivable together with military
occupation, all among the same parties? It is rather squaring
the circle: We question the rationale of such policy and believe
that a pledge for normalisation implies actual ending of military
occupation. Confidence Building is the next step after normalisation.
<P>
The Mediterranean will certainly take a qualitative step forward
when the phenomenon of military occupation ceases to exist, as
well as when the military regimes themselves cease to exist. That
will be the threshold of an all encompassing normalisation, the
prerequisite to a Mediterranean policy of cooperation and the
building of a common concept of security.
<P>
c) Arms Control and Regional Security
<P>
The present regional status is based on assymetry and double standard.
The Mediterranean countries are not equal parties to the international
instruments governing disarmament, non-proliferation and control
regimes.
<P>
The unequal status with regard to arms of mass destruction, nuclear
technology and systems of delivery will thus hinder promoting
confidence and regional security. Initiatives on coordination
and control of conventional arm transfer into the region cannot
ignore that status, as well as the status of net importer countries
and those which are partial producers.
<P>
It is part of the confidence building policy to weigh the actual
military status of the concerned parties and pledge equal international
guarantees for all.
<P>
d) International Legality
<P>
The building of regional cooperation is not a way of escape from
common law. International legality is basic and binding to all.
The search for regional understanding and cooperation could only
take stock of basic &quot;clear&quot; relationships with regard
to international legality and, additionally, develop more advanced
facilities and free concessions. In no way could it justify some
parties avoiding their obligations or legitimise attempts to force
other parties to renounce their rights in accordance with international
conventions and essential UN resolutions. It is not a substitute
to international legality.
<P>
In the process of building mutual understanding and regional system
of cooperation, admission of international legality helps generate
reliability and better predictability, leading to an atmosphere
of relaxation and improved openness and receptivity. Deliberate
rejection of international legality can only generate suspicion
and justify counter-strategies and defensive attitudes. Unequal
parties could only become true and genuine partners through their
common respect of international legality.
<P>
e) Respect of Nations
<P>
The Mediterranean, cradle of old civilizations, has given birth
to many nations which fought their way to existence and lived
their time of grandeur: whatever the fate and the present size
of these nations, they have resisted the trials of time and put
forward their indestructible will and right to live as nations.
Based on ethnic or religious or cultural values, these nations
claim a specific identity and intractable rights to land, culture
and free exercise of sovereignty.
<P>
Since the first World War, the Mediterranean order failed in its
many attempts based on exclusion or dominance. The decolonisation,
the regional wars, the disintegration of Yugoslavia are living
proof that dominance, exclusion or imposed federal &quot;aggregation&quot;
are not durable: the restoration of these old &quot;nucleus&quot;
Nations is irresistible.
<P>
The order of the day ought to be the shaping of a new Mediterranean
order, based on non-domination and on the respect of Nations with
their differences.
<P>
f) The External Factor
<P>
War, antagonism, extremism, have long been the lot of the Mediterranean
peoples. Though rooted in the very local realities and passions,
these events have been heavily &quot;fueled&quot; by actors from
abroad: providers of weapon and logistics, clients and semi-allies,
accomplices by way of disinformation. The external powers have
constantly played their roles in the current affairs of the unstable
and coveted Mediterranean.
<P>
Let us not forget that fifty two years ago (November 1942), the
Allied forces landed in North Africa as a stronghold in order
to free Europe. It was two years before the landing in Normandy;
and that in the wake of the de-colonisation period, the navies
of the two super-powers were permanently operating in the Mediterranean.
The area was constantly used in the interest of Europe and other
powers.
<P>
The end of the Cold War and the consequences of the second Gulf
War have brought a qualitative change in the role of the outside
actors: the basic structure of interests has remained unchanged,
but with field objectives adapted to the new geometry of forces.
While processes of negotiations are being developed in all the
hot spots around the Mediterranean, important observations are
worth mentioning:
<P>
i) Enforcement of international legality is poor, erratic and
seemingly paralysed;
<P>
ii) A major role is assumed by the UN in all crises but one;
<P>
iii) Against the policy of curbing the arms race in the region,
as declared after the Gulf War and supported by new agreed instruments
for
<P>
transparency and control regimes, huge amounts of advanced conventional
arms are transferred to the region.
<P>
iv) The United States, being the co-sponsor of the Peace Process
in the Middle-East, is the strategic ally of one party to the
negotiations, Israel, providing it with strategic armament and
assistance, regular financial aid and sharing with it high military
technology;
<P>
v) In the same token, regimes of sanctions (either bilateral or
international) extend to other negotiators: Syria, Lebanon and
Jordan as well as to selected countries of the second row: Libya
and Iraq, not to speak of Sudan and Iran.
<P>
The contrast is quite clear: the &quot;fair and free negotiations&quot;
are developing amid heavy and open pressure applied on the Arab
and Islamic side of the table by the biggest world actor on the
stage.
<H4>2. The National Aspects</H4>

<P>
We realize the weight of international factors on the current
Security trends. The dilemma is heavier with the concurrence of
difficulties within the concerned nations.
<P>
Two main groups are going through difficult times: the Slav and
the Semitic groups of nations are yet to find their balance and
harmony among themselves. Horizontal conflicts among the Slavs
(particularly Yugoslavs in the south) as well as among the sons
of Abraham, Arabs and Jews, are rather well known features, North
and South of the Mediterranean.
<P>
Furthermore, conflictual relations are periodically cropping up
within the Jewish community as well as the Arab community. Indeed,
they are not making it any easier.
<P>
We will just consider the level of these differences in connection
with the regional Mediterranean perspective: their impact on respective
domestic policy is not of relevance to us.
<P>
a) Normalisation
<P>
As physicians and psychiatrists know, normalcy is the rule but
hardly the reality of life. More than is the case with individuals,
nations favor identifying themselves with heroic achievements,
legends and myths; they may even claim divine privileges over
the rest of mankind. Legitimate feeling of exaltation, when it
is the reward of real sacrifice and successful action of self
defense, could easily turn into abnormal doctrines and transpolitical
strategies.
<P>
A chain of historic events has built up series of national standards
of that kind. No matter if it does not affect the political culture,
in harmony with the spirit of the time. But it matters very much
if other nations fall victim of such abnormalcy.
<P>
I will not go any further into this; I will just conclude that
<U>normalcy</U> is the gateway to <U>normalisation</U>. When nations
use self-exaltation and set their standards so as to hurt the
rights and dignity of other nations, they ought to stand first,
as normal people, align themselves as just human beings, no less
but indeed no more, and admit normalcy as a common rule.
<P>
Once they normalise and align themselves with the common standard
of international legality and assume principles of reciprocity
and equal treatment, they will deserve normalisation with other
civilized nations and will be admitted as equal among equals.
So did the white community in South Africa: they deserve our respect.
<P>
b) Fundamentalism
<P>
Fundamentalism is a serious threat to many countries all over
the Mediterranean. As an expression of religious absolutism, it
is inconsistent with a strategy of pluralism, tolerance and universal
values, which are the basic premises of regional cooperation among
nations of different faith and culture.
<P>
Religious extremism has expanded from Israel to Iran and thereafter
to other neighbours among Islamic and Christian societies all
along the South and North Mediterranean, all the way up to Morocco
and Yugoslavia. It has been fueled by several factors:
<P>
- Failure to resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict and particularly
the Palestinian question, whose resolution is undoubtedly one
of the major keys to peace and security in the region. It fuels
the forces of extremism that want to substitute the appeal of
religion and martyrdom to international law and regular diplomacy,
<P>
- The West's perceived opportunism, as it first used the Jihad
in Afghanistan then turned hostile to the Muslim people in their
struggle for freedom and dignity;
<P>
- The danger of Serbian expansion, aiming at the destruction of
the Muslim population in Bosnia.
<P>
These various sources are compounded by the widespread frustration
over economic stagnation which further fuels the ongoing historical
struggle between the forces of democratisation and the forces
of conservatism and extremism.
<P>
These movements use violence in their effort to punish individuals
or take over a country and replace its secular government with
a theocratic regime poised to fight the basic values of democracy
and individual liberties, identified with evil.
<P>
The disturbances in Algeria by the Fundamentalists and the actual
threat over its regime constitute a challenge to the stability
and the security of all neighbouring countries including southern
Europe.
<H4><B>3. Regional and sub-regional momentum</B></H4>

<P>
The current processes of negotiations have their own logic and
momentum. In the Middle-East, Cyprus and ex-Yugoslavia, they ultimately
aim at defining the national expression of minorities. The Eastern
basin of the Mediterranean will enter an era of stability and
common security when the political map is fixed and legitimised
through mutual and total recognition.
<P>
The picture in the Western basin is different. Though totally
committed to the objectives at stake in the Eastern flank, the
Western basin countries already enjoy a status of relative stability
and supra-national organisation. The five Maghreb countries (Members
of the Union of Arab Maghreb created in 1989) and the four latin
European countries (members of the European Union) and Malta have
set up in October 1990 a process of multilateral cooperation known
as 5 + 5. This sub-regional system of cooperation answers the
common specific concerns and priorities of the member countries,
which are of economic and social nature.
<P>
The serious imbalance in these fields between the two groups has
a security dimension. The Forum 5 + 5 is designed to initiate
a global approach to these diverse issues and to develop a broad
and permanent dialogue on cooperation and security in the sub-region.
Such a process has different scope and political dynamics, compared
with the current processes in the Eastern basin. The issues at
stake are of a different nature.
<P>
The challenges in both sub-regions are equally surmountable, but
with separate logic and momentum. What is comforting is that all
contribute to a new genesis of understanding and broad integration.
Subordination of these processes would hinder the momentum of
the global dynamics.
<P>
With the European experience in mind, we may illustrate the current
Mediterranean trend with the following scale:
<P>
From To
<P>
1. Political negation Political being
<P>
2. Legal recognition Stability
<P>
3. Co-existence Cooperation
<P>
4. Multilateral cooperation Supra-national organisation
<P>
= regional security (Common institutions with
<P>
regional mandate)
<P>
While the Eastern basin countries are in between &quot;political
being and legal recognition&quot;, the Western basin countries
are between &quot;multilateral cooperation and supra-national
organisation&quot;.
<P>
The current phase in the Middle East, which is of diplomatic nature,
is a mixed approach in between &quot;multilateral negotiation
and conditional recognition&quot;.
<P>
One may ask whether, considering the particular &quot;Mediterranean
structure&quot;, a larger forum of the size of CSCM would operate
as a catalyst and help overcome the last resistance in the current
negotiations. I would favour a positive but cautious approach.
<P>
Substantive progress should be acknowledged: the reciprocal recognition
by Israel and the PLO has helped lift important obstacles in the
process of normalcy and normalisation, and it cleared some deliberate
confusion over basic concepts which have long obstructed the dialogue
between the parties, (such as terrorism, collective and individual
rights, national and citizen status). Together with this substantive
step, other issues of ethical and legal dimension are to be cleared:
mainly the colonial dimension, the military occupation, and the
respect of international legality. A clear stand
<P>
on these issues is of strategic importance, for the Mediterranean
as well as the world.
<P>
We would therefore recommend more meetings on informal basis,
rather than a formal CSCM-Conference, in order to first help build
a strong consensus on issues of human and ethical dimension, extending
to all the conflicts still pending in the Mediterranean arena.
<H4><B>4. Conclusion</B></H4>

<P>
More than any other region, the Mediterranean must meet the challenge
of setting up a regional order so as to conciliate equal rights
with unequal might among all riparian Nations. For the first time
in history, the Mediterranean is trying to find its way towards
one comprehensive system, including all nations big and small,
based on non-domination, and common principles rather than exclusive
factors. The concept is not coexistence as was the European order
before the Helsinki Act, which was based on balance of terror,
but a system based on three premises:
<P>
- acceptance of equal rights for all nations;
<P>
- acceptance of free cooperation;
<P>
- acceptance of differences in power, faith and ethnicity.
<P>
It will be indeed an unprecedented Mediterranean order.

<H2><B>TRENDS AND RISKS OF SECURITY IN THE MIDDLE EAST</B></H2>

<P>
<B>Brig.Gen. (Res.) Aryeh SHALEV</B>
<P>
Senior Research Fellow, The Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies
<P>
Tel Aviv University, Israel<HR>

<P>
The subject I will speak about is Security Trends and Risks in
the Middle East in the coming 5-10 years. Being a researcher at
the Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies at Tel Aviv University,
whatever I will say represents only my personal opinion.
<P>
It could be said, in general, that security trends derive from
the following main factors: major opposing interests between countries;
the concept of rival states about legitimate means to be used
to attain objectives, including or excluding the use of force;
the regional and world political ambiance; the internal situation
and the degree of instability in rival states. In this context:
will the Arab countries continue to be ruled by totalitarian regimes
or a change will occur towards democratization? Will fundamentalism
expand and take over the control in Arab states bordering Israel
or be considerably weakened and even curbed?
<P>
Before referring to possible future security trends in the Middle
East and risks to Israel, I would like to present three basic
elements which affect the Israeli concept, and which should be
kept in mind:
<P>
(a) The ratio between the active ground forces of Israel and the
Arab confronting states is quite negative and disadvantageous
for Israel (1:6). This fact is relevant since it could be estimated
that in the case of a war in the Middle East, Arab states will
do their utmost to start it by surprise, when the balance of the
ground active forces is in their great advantage, before Israel
mobilizes its reserve forces (the time necessary to mobilize and
deploy the reserve is 48 hours).
<P>
(b) A second important factor is the topographic one: the West
Bank dominates the coastal plan, which is the essential part of
Israel, the width
<P>
of which is only 13 to 30 kilometers. The Golan Heights dominate
the Hule and the Gordan valleys adjacent to the international
border.
<P>
(c) Potential acts of war against Israel could be initiated and
carried out either by neighbouring or by distant Arab Muslim states,
or by both. The Israeli population was already, during the Golf
War, a target for surface-to-surface missiles launched by Iraq.
Thus, the towns in the depth of Israel turned into a front line,
and this may be the case in the future as well. Distant countries
that posses long range surface-to-surface missiles are Iraq, Iran
and Libya.
<P>
In my opinion, risks of war in the Middle East will continue in
the coming years, until the peace develops to one between the
peoples, to a peace like the one existing between France and Germany;
countries that repeatedly fought but reached the stage of no risk
of war where the border has no more any security significance.
<P>
I am optimistic about the chances of peace between Israel and
the Arab countries but cannot ignore potential security risks.
With respect to security risks, I will refer to risks and not
try to make a forecast of events. I will analyze the risks deriving
from the development or regression of one major variable which
is the Arab-Israel Peace Process. I see three possible scenarios:
<P>
<U>First-</U>The assumption in this scenario is the worst possible
case, i.e. that the parties involved were unable to overcome the
serious difficulties and obstacles they encountered in the negotiations.
Thus no peace agreement was reached, the negotiations failed and
broke, and the status returned to one of tension and possible
struggle. If this scenario takes place, the risks could be:
<P>
(a) Progressive rise of tension and the military option of another
Arab-Israeli war in which the key country will be only Syria but
other neighbouring states will take part as well. The war could
include the
<P>
launching of long range surface-to-surface missiles (by Iraq,
Lybia and Iran) against civilian and probably also military targets
in the depth of Israel.
<P>
(b) Struggle over sensitive issues, like water resources and water
rights.
<P>
(c) Activation of terror against Israel and Israelis.
<P>
(d) Weakening of the Israeli-Egyptian peace structure and even
gradual regression towards a state of no peace and no war.
<P>
<U>Second</U>- Even in the positive case that a peace treaty is
signed between Israel and Syria as well as between Israel and
the P.L.O., a long period will be required to implement the various
difficult articles and phases and to develop the peace to a stage
of peace between the peoples. During this long period serious
difficulties could hamper the execution of the agreement, and
be followed by limited use of force. The risk during this long
period could be :
<P>
(a) Activation of terror against Israel and the Israelis, the
main targets being Jerusalem, Israeli settlements in the West
Bank and Gaza, and terrorism from Lebanon, controlled by Syria,
in the northern part of Israel.
<P>
(b) A military confrontation having a limited or a vast objective.
The purpose being either to gain territory or to get hold of stronger
cards.
<P>
<U>Third</U>- The more optimistic scenario, assuming that peace
treaties were signed with Jordan, Syria and the Palestinian and
the peace developed, after years, into peace between the peoples.
It seems that extremist organizations and states would act to
sabotage the execution of the agreement. The risks could be:
<P>
(a) Launching of long range surface-to-surface missiles by Iraq,
Lybia and Iran.
<P>
(b) Activation of terror against Israel by Palestinian extremists
and Hisballah from Lebanon.

<H2><B>TRENDS AND CHALLENGES IN GLOBAL ARMS CONTROL REGIMES</B>
</H2>

<H3><B>Implications for the Mediterranean, North Africa and the
Middle East</B></H3>

<P>
<B>Ronald F. LEHMAN II</B>
<P>
Assistant to the Director University of California
<P>
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
<P>
Livermore, California<HR>

<P>
The Mediterranean Academy of Diplomatic Studies at the University
of Malta, the Henry L. Stimson Center, and the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs of Malta are to be commended for initiating this international
workshop on &Ograve;Arms Control, Confidence-Building and Security
Cooperation in the Mediterranean, North Africa and the Middle
East.&Oacute; You have brought together an impressive array of
policy makers and experts, and you have done so when it is most
useful. In every direction from Malta, in lands across the Mediterranean,
political developments are underway which will have significant
security consequences far beyond this region. For that reason,
I have come here to learn as much as to contribute. Nevertheless,
I have been asked to initiate discussion of current trends and
challenges facing global arms control regimes and their implications
for Mediterranean, North African and Middle Eastern states.
<P>
What defines &Ograve;global&Oacute; is, of course, a matter of
perspective. For European historians, Malta marks the center of
what was once called the &Ograve;known world.&Oacute; Malta is
still at the center of one of the most important regions on the
globe, and events on the Mediterranean Sea and in nations nearby
have throughout history demonstrated a world-wide impact. Today
is no different.
<P>
And because of the importance of this region, events far away
can have major security implications here whether or not they
are truly global in their reach. Just as what happens in Russia
or China or South Asia or the United States matters here, so developments
here are of great importance to nations around the globe.
<P>
In another sense, however, the nuclear age and ballistic missiles
long ago created a much smaller world in which the distinctions
between global and regional security have been lessened. In an
age of weapons of mass destruction, any point on the earth can
find itself suddenly at the center of world attention. This makes
it all the more important that we understand all of the arms control
tools available, including global approaches.
<P>
In discussing global arms control regimes, I will focus primarily
on those that are open to universal membership such as the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) or which have global reach, such
as certain export control and supplier regimes. It is important
to remember, however, that certain regional, bilateral, and even
unilateral arms control measures can have a global impact as well.
One need only witness the impact of the Treaty on Conventional
Forces in Europe (CFE). Despite its mere &Ograve;Atlantic to the
Urals&Oacute; focus, the CFE treaty helped change the political
and strategic calculations of the entire world. Likewise, the
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), with
its headquarters in Vienna, is centered on Europe but spreads
from Vancouver to Vladivostok (or perhaps we should say from Amchitka
to Kamchatka), circumnavigating much of the northern hemisphere
when measured the long way around via North America. The political
significance of its successes and failures outdistance CSCE's
geographical spread.
<P>
Similarly, bilateral agreements such as the START I and START
II treaties radically reducing strategic nuclear forces to a small
fraction of the levels which once existed have global implications.
Large numbers of ballistic missiles with intercontinental range
are being eliminated. New standards of transparency and openness
have been established. New practices of restraint have been initiated.
The draw down in forces has a direct impact here in the Mediterranean.
<P>
Unilateral steps taken by the Great Powers have a global application
and also an impact here. A decision by President George Bush to
remove tactical nuclear weapons from around the globe and to terminate
the routine deployment of tactical nuclear weapons, including
nuclear sea-launched cruise missiles on its ships, has been reciprocated
as a parallel declaration of policy by Russia. The implications
for the Mediterranean littoral are obvious. Of course, not all
unilateral developments are positive. Actions by North Korea to
ship missiles into the Middle East demonstrates how decisions
of nations far away can have a tremendous impact on the stability
of vital regions such as those around the Mediterranean. Although
not all approaches to arms control can or should be global, thinking
globally is inherent in the process.
<P>
The history of arms control has long had a global perspective.
From the 1940s to the 1960s, general and complete disarmament
dominated discussions at international fora. Such a dramatic approach
seemed out of synchronization with the realities of the Cold War
and seems only somewhat nearer at hand today when one considers
the conflicts raging around the world. Nevertheless, general and
complete disarmament remains an objective codified in the preambles
and provisions of several international treaties and recorded
even in U.S. domestic law. Although we are well short of general
and complete disarmament, an extensive global arms control regime
has emerged, particularly for dealing with weapons of mass destruction.
A brief overview of regimes in place or awaiting ratification
can give one a feeling of the extensive nature of what has been
accomplished.
<P>
Efforts to ban the use of poisons in war date back to the Middle
Ages and perhaps even earlier, but a global approach to preventing
the use of poisons as weapons has been a central theme in international
disarmament negotiations since the Hague Conventions of the 1890s.
Over 140 nations are currently parties to the Geneva Protocol
of 1925 which prohibits the use in war of poison gas or bacteriological
weapons. In acceding to the Geneva Protocols, most nations reserved
the right to use chemical weapons in retaliation to first use
by others.
<P>
Significantly, a number of nations in the Middle East and North
Africa are not parties to the Geneva Protocol. Moreover, it was
the use of chemical weapons in this region, most particularly
by Iraq which is a party to the Geneva Protocol, which prompted
the creation of the Australia Group in 1985, a suppliers export
control regime among nations which trade extensively among their
chemical industries. Indeed, it was the prospect that chemical
weapons might have been even more widely used as a result of Iraq&Otilde;s
aggression against Kuwait and the resulting Gulf War that led
to the completion in 1992 of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC)
.
<P>
Opened for signature in January 1993, the CWC prohibits the development,
production, stockpiling, and use of chemical weapons and provides
for the destruction of existing stocks. The CWC takes transparency,
data exchange, and intrusive inspection to a new frontier. The
Convention also establishes a permanent Organization for the Prohibition
of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) and provides for assistance to parties
threatened with chemical weapons and for sanctions in the case
of violations. The Treaty also would limit trade in chemicals
with non-parties.
<P>
A similar comprehensive ban on the production and stockpiling
of biological and toxin weapons was concluded in 1972, but this
treaty, the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) does not provide
for the extensive international organization and verification
procedures provided for by the CWC. It also has far fewer members.
Again, a large number of the nations not party to the Biological
Weapons Convention are located in the areas around the Mediterranean.
<P>
Given the particularly dangerous and heinous aspects of biological
warfare, and taking into account the more extensive verification
regimes negotiated for the Chemical Weapons Convention, considerable
interest has been expressed in providing verification measures
for the BWC. An ad hoc group of government experts (VEREX) was
established by the Third Review Conference held in 1991. These
experts have reported on a number of possible verification measures
which might enhance confidence in compliance with the BWC. The
next review conference is scheduled for 1996, but a special conference
may well act on measures later this year.
<P>
Interest in strengthening the Biological Weapons Convention has
grown since Russian President Boris Yeltsin revealed that the
Soviet Union had been conducting an offensive biological weapons
program in violation of the BWC for many years.
<P>
With nearly 170 states parties, no international arms control
treaty is more widely adhered to than the Treaty on the Nonproliferation
of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) signed in 1968. Under the NPT, non-nuclear
weapons states agree not to manufacture or acquire nuclear weapons.
In exchange, they are guaranteed great access to nuclear technology
and have codified a commitment from nuclear weapons states to
pursue nuclear disarmament.
<P>
To provide for verification, parties are required to conclude
safeguards agreements with the International Atomic Energy Agency
(IAEA) to monitor nuclear materials. In accordance with U.N. Security
Council Resolution 255, passed in 1968, the Security Council and
especially its nuclear weapons state permanent members are required
to act immediately in accordance with their obligations under
the U.N. charter if a non-nuclear weapons state party to the NPT
is under threat of aggression with nuclear weapons. To further
strengthen the global nuclear nonproliferation regime, the Convention
on Physical Protection of Nuclear Material was concluded in March
of 1980. This convention provided mandatory international standards
for the security of international transit of certain nuclear materials.
<P>
In the nuclear area, the global approach has gone beyond the surface
of the earth. The 1963 Limited Test Ban Treaty (LTBT) prohibits
nuclear weapons tests in the atmosphere, in outer space, and under
water and has approximately 120 parties. About a hundred nations
have also signed the 1967 Outer Space Treaty prohibiting the orbiting
of weapons of mass destruction around the earth or the stationing
of such weapons on the moon or elsewhere in outer space. Nearly
as many nations have signed the 1971 Sea-bed Treaty which prohibits
placement of nuclear weapons on seabeds or the ocean floor beyond
a twelve mile territorial zone.
<P>
The Antarctic Treaty of 1959, which provides for the demilitarization
of that polar continent and which provides for extensive inspections
of activities conducted there, has 42 members from around the
globe. Even existing regional nuclear-weapons-free zones, such
as Latin America&Otilde;s 1967 Treaty of Tlatelolco and the South
Pacific&Otilde;s 1985 Treaty of Rarotonga, have protocols under
which the nuclear weapons states and some others undertake obligations
to respect their zones.
<P>
Regional arms control regimes and processes with limited membership
can also have a global impact. I have mentioned the Treaty on
Conventional Forces in Europe and the CSCE process which are even
more important in this region because much of the northern edge
of the Mediterranean is formed by nations which are parties to
the CSCE agreement.
<P>
One can see the interaction between global and regional arms control
in the Arms Control and Regional Security Working Group which
has been established as part of the Middle East peace process.
It is hosted by the United States and Russia, but in addition
to the Israeli and Arab participants, observers from interested
nations outside the region also participate.
<P>
Bilateral regimes can also have a global impact. For example,
the U.S.-Soviet Incidents at Sea Agreement has for many years
provided a private consultative process to reduce the chances
of military confrontation as a result of accident or miscalculation
on the high seas. The implications in this region are also obvious.
Bilateral regimes have even served as precursors for global approaches.
For example, in 1989 the United States and the Soviet Union concluded
the Bilateral Chemical Weapons Exchange Agreement in order to
provide a firmer foundation for the negotiation of a global ban
on chemical weapons. Taking this approach one step further, in
1990 the two sides concluded a bilateral chemical weapons destruction
agreement to add further momentum to efforts to conclude a global
Chemical Weapons Convention.
<P>
In looking at the implications of global arms control developments
for enhancing security and the peace process in the Mediterranean
region, it is important to recognize that a number of global organizations
play an important role. I have already mentioned the International
Atomic Energy Agency and the Organization for the Prohibition
of Chemical Weapons, but it is important to recognize also the
important role of the United Nations and its affiliated organizations.
Of course, the Security Council is playing an increasingly central
role in arms control enforcement and has established the U.N.
Special Commission which, with the IAEA, helps monitor compliance
with U.N. resolutions in Iraq.
<P>
The General Assembly has played an important role in obtaining
more universal participation in global arms control regimes. It
considers annual reports from the IAEA and through its First Committee
and the Disarmament Commission puts a spotlight on global and
regional arms control priorities.
<P>
Global regimes I have described thus far are often said to deal
with the demand for weapons and weapons related technology. Traditionally,
parties to the treaty have sought the widest possible adherence.
There are also a number of global regimes which deal with the
supply side of the equation. Here membership has tended to be
limited.
<P>
The Australia group has sought to help prevent the spread of chemical
and biological weapons by educating industry and rationalizing
national export control laws around the world. It provides greater
transparency and increased ability to intervene in cases where
shipments of sensitive technologies or materials are destined
for potential proliferators. Some fifty dual use chemicals are
controlled, along with certain dual use equipment.
<P>
A similarly informal regime was established in 1987 to deal with
the threat of ballistic missiles, the Missile Technology Control
Regime (MTCR). Members of the regime have agreed to control rocket
and unmanned air delivery systems which can go 300 kilometers
with a 500 kilogram payload. Certain missile related technologies
and materials are also controlled.
<P>
The grandfather of supplier control regimes was the Zangger Committee,
established in 1971 to advise the IAEA on certain nuclear materials,
and equipment for dealing with them, which should be monitored
by IAEA safeguards. In 1975, the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG)
was established with essentially the same membership but its mandate
and scope has evolved considerably. NSG guidelines now require
full scope safeguards on all nuclear activities as a condition
for any supply of source and special fissionable materials. The
NSG has also promulgated guidelines for the transfer of nuclear
related dual use equipment and material.
<P>
Most of these suppliers groups are made up of about twenty-five
of the same advanced industrial nations. Because supplier technology
has spread and because some barriers to cooperation among more
diverse nations have been reduced, increased consideration has
been given to expanding their membership. Recently, for example,
Argentina and Ukraine attended meetings of the NSG as observers.
<P>
Thus far, I have focused on global regimes dealing primarily with
weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery. Over
the years a number of efforts have been made to manage Conventional
Arms Transfers (CAT). In 1992 the United Nations established a
register of conventional arms, a voluntary process whereby member
states supply data on the exports and imports of major weapons
systems and provide general information on equipment levels and
production. Over 80 nations have submitted data, and a panel of
government experts will convene later in the year to review the
possibility of improvements. Participation in the U.N. register
of conventional arms has been much more extensive than participation
in the U.N. developed instrument for standardized international
reporting of military expenditures where fewer than 40 nations
have reported to the U.N. General Assembly on their military budgets.
<P>
On the supply side, and in a regional context, the five major
arms suppliers to the Middle East; namely, the U.S., China, France,
the U.K. and Russia, agreed in October of 1991 to common guidelines
on the export of conventional arms, again with important implications
for this region.
<P>
Agreement was not reached, however, on the question of prior notification
of sales.
<P>
This overview of global arms control regimes and more limited
regimes with global impact, however cursory, gives us a measure
of how far global regimes and regimes with global reach have advanced.
It also gives us an understanding of what global regimes have
not been able to address, and it suggests where they are in danger
of falling short of their objectives.
<P>
Global, regional, and bilateral arms control agreements have given
nations more experience, new concepts, and improved institutions
for applying arms control tools to security and diplomatic problems.
Implementation of the START I and START II treaties will for many
years continue to result in the actual reduction of strategic
nuclear delivery systems with global reach. The scope of arms
control activity has been expanded beyond weapons of mass destruction.
<P>
Not all developments, however, have been positive. As we get closer
to universal participation in global regimes, it is becoming more
and more difficult to persuade the last few nations of interest
to join. Worse, as in the case with North Korea, difficulty in
enforcing compliance with existing agreements further undermines
efforts to codify an international norm. Whether the framework
of global arms control agreements can long survive efforts by
some inside and outside the treaties to keep the regimes weak
remains to be seen. Certainly the euphoria for international collective
action which followed the end of the Cold War and the Gulf War
has been dashed by developments in Bosnia, Somalia, and Korea.
The international community most supportive of global approaches
to arms control has come face to face with the regional and sectarian
complexities and dangers for which broad-brush approaches are
often least relevant.
<P>
It is often said that nuclear war was unlikely, but the consequences
were beyond human imagination, and thus nuclear disarmament deserved
our highest priority. The corollary to that was that although
regional and ethnic violence was frequent, the consequences were
less severe. Today&Otilde;s world is revealing that the price
in human suffering of local conflicts is great and
<P>
the risk that advanced weapons, including weapons of mass destruction,
might increase the carnage makes the fear even greater. For many
regions, global applications can establish an arms control baseline
at best. In some cases, global approaches are not yet ripe for
application and in other cases they may be inadequate or even
counterproductive.
<P>
Regional complexities are not the only obstacles which have emerged
to global approaches. Although technology offers the prospects
for improved verification and greater transparency, the inevitable
spread of dual use technology makes it difficult for arms control
to keep pace with the threats the global regimes were designed
to limit. Also, as the effective implementation of global regimes
becomes more tedious, more expensive, more painful, and less glamorous,
interest in addressing even the highest priority international
security issues may wane. This does not mean that preference for
global approaches will necessarily decline. In some cases, it
may mean that globalization of issues may become increasingly
attractive as a way for nations to avoid dealing with difficult
regional or domestic problems. Frankly, global approaches to arms
control at large, by which I mean to include both confidence building
and nonproliferation, face a number of important challenges. How
global regimes deal with these challenges will be important to
nations in this region, whether they are parties in good standing
or not.
<P>
Perhaps the most significant challenge to global approaches to
arms control today is keeping what has already been achieved.
UNSCOM inspections revealed in Iraq how a nation party to the
NPT could still come very close to achieving nuclear weapons.
In the Iraqi case, the most intrusive arms control compliance
regime ever established has been imposed, but we must remember
that it is the product of Iraq's defeat in war. The viability
of the long term monitoring program in Iraq years from now is
uncertain.
<P>
Perhaps a greater compliance challenge to global agreements involves
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). When implementation
of IAEA Safeguards agreements revealed discrepancies in North
Korean data and when negotiation of challenge inspection provisions
for the Korean peninsula denuclearization agreement and prospects
for special inspections
<P>
by the IAEA threatened to reveal the extent of its covert nuclear
weapons program, Pyongyang announced it would withdraw from the
NPT and later the IAEA. The drama continues today.
<P>
Here I would simply like to emphasize two points on global aspects
of the Korean situation and a third point on regional approaches.
First, this is not a bilateral dispute between North Korea and
either the United States or South Korea. The treaty North Korea
is violating has nearly 170 other parties. The IAEA is an international
organization with members and inspectors from many nations. The
major military command in Korea is a United Nations Command. My
point is that global approaches will be of limited value in particularly
troubled regions if they do not get global support. Second, when
Pyongyang threatened to withdraw from the NPT, many commentators
reacted as if withdrawal would relieve North Korea of its obligations.
Legally, the North cannot escape the consequences of its violations
by invoking the withdrawal clause, but the failure to insist that
North Korea undo its violations whether it remains a party or
not will turn the NPT into a fast track to nuclear proliferation
of ever more limited value, particularly as, in the years ahead,
more and more countries have the knowledge, technology, and material
to make nuclear weapons. This leads to my third point and a related
fourth point. Strengthening the international norm, not weakening
it is what is needed. In that regard, it is disappointing that
so much of the debate over the NPT extension conference is over
duration rather than strengthening it. My fourth point is that
global regimes such as the NPT may not be enough, particularly
in unstable regions. The NPT plus regime developed for the Korean
Peninsula with its additional ban on plutonium reprocessing facilities
and uranium enrichment facilities and its additional bilateral
inspection provisions forced North Korea to reveal its hand, but
also offers a regime which can help walk the Korean Peninsula
back away from the nuclear abyss if we are prepared to insist
that parties to the NPT live up to their obligations to all of
us.
<P>
A second, and inherent, challenge to global arms control regimes
is the question of universality. Non-proliferation has come close
to being customary international law with the U.N. Security Council
declaring at its
<P>
January 1992 Summit that proliferation is a threat to international
security. Nevertheless, we remain a world built upon sovereign
states with each having the right to decide if they will join
treaties or if they will remain parties.
<P>
Global approaches can have the advantage of bringing states within
a region to a common position which they might not reach bilaterally
or in a regional context. North and South Korea would not have
become parties to the NPT when they did, if it had required a
bilateral negotiation. Where face to face contact is necessary
to address critical disputes, however, this can be a disadvantage.
Indian emphasis on universal, global approaches to a number of
nuclear issues has had a chilling effect on possible step-by-step
approaches with its neighbors and others.
<P>
The multiplicity of global regimes dealing with weapons of mass
destruction has resulted in a number of nations joining some of
the regimes but withholding signature and ratification of others.
Often this is caught up in regional security disputes, for example,
the decision by a number of Arab states to link their membership
in the CWC to Israeli adherence to the NPT. The number of nations
not party to the global regimes dealing with weapons of mass destruction
is not large, but many are located in and around the Mediterranean
region.
<P>
Lack of universality need not be a threat to global regimes, but
it is likely to become one. Nations party to such agreements will
question the merits of membership if other nations, particularly
neighbors and potential adversaries, are not subject to comparable
restraint. More immediately, nations which have not joined these
regimes in order to keep near-term options open may act to weaken
the regimes in order to keep them at bay. Here I might suggest
an approach particularly useful in this region. The international
community must recognize that global arms control proposals may
not be timely or suitable to the security and foreign policy considerations
of particular nations and regions. Parties to global regimes can
demand, however, that nations not actively work to torpedo the
regimes these parties have created to enhance their own security.
They can expect non-parties to work to address some of the same
security threats,
<P>
such as those posed by the spread of weapons of mass destruction,
by other means or in step-by-step fashion.
<P>
A third challenge is that global regimes may be expected to address
issues for which they are not appropriate, least suitable, or
most inefficient. Confidence-building measures (CBMs) provide
a good example. The debate is old over whether CBMs are required
to reduce political tensions or whether reductions in political
tensions are necessary to implement CBMs. The truth is usually
a bit of both.
<P>
CBMs seem to be at their best when they are helping a political
process which is underway between nations experiencing very real
difficulties. Global CBMs such as the UN arms registry can be
of some value, but they appear shallow, and perhaps sometimes
even counterproductive, outside a regional or bilateral context.
One can imagine a global open skies regime, but the cost effectiveness
of such a regime as it might actually emerge is questionable.
Open skies, however, proved useful in the East-West context, and
Hungary and Romania found it helpful in a bilateral context. Regional
approaches to end the production of unsafeguarded fissile material
could be promising in regions such as South Asia, but insistence
on only a global approach would block those avenues for progress.
Transparency has proven to be an important basis for confidence
building, but if not carefully applied, can exacerbate problems,
prompting political posturing and arms races.
<P>
A fourth challenge to global regimes is that of scope. Over 100
million people have been killed in this century by weapons that
are not even advanced conventional munitions, much less weapons
of mass destruction. The end of the Cold War and the East-West
arms control revolution have not prevented the bloodshed in Bosnia,
Somalia, Rwanda, and the like. Indeed, the large weapons frequently
used in ethnic fighting in the states of the former Soviet Union
are the items excluded from the CFE Treaty as paramilitary equipment.
A global convention has been proposed on land-mines because of
their residual lethality for innocent civilians long after conflicts
are over, but mankind has demonstrated that it will kill with
whatever weapons are at its disposal.
<P>
This should remind us that controlling arms is but a tool for
dealing with more fundamental political and security problems.
In short, the scope of global arms control may expand to deal
with new categories of weapons, but we must take care that arms
control isolated from the basic causes of conflict can result
in the diversion of attention, energy, and resources from the
more immediate problems to be addressed. These processes can be
complementary, and we should insure that they are.
<P>
A fifth challenge to global regimes concerns maintaining the standards
necessary to meet real security concerns. I have already described
efforts to strengthen the NPT and the BWC and other global regimes,
but I have also pointed out that supplemental efforts are necessary
in some regions. A number of measures, such as the requirement
for full scope safeguards as a condition for the supply of certain
nuclear material, have strengthened the non-proliferation regime,
but, as I have suggested, an NPT plus regime will be necessary
for Iraq and Korea. Even the U.S. and Russia have been evolving
bilateral &quot;plus&quot; regimes for both the BWC and the CWC
which are themselves global.
<P>
Undoubtedly in other regions global regimes will need a &quot;plus&quot;
for the nations in those regions to have confidence that their
security is being adequately enhanced. The &quot;plus&quot; however
cannot be only arms control, and need not be arms control at all.
Rather, improvements in the overall political and security equations
are more important. Arms control measures played a useful role
in bringing about the end of the Cold War, but the Cold War came
to an end only because fundamental political changes took place.
<P>
One should not get the impression that standards will always be
tightened, that ever more detailed restrictions and verification
is the inevitable outcome of all future global approaches to arms
control and confidence-building. The same strict standards are
not necessary under all circumstances, and something of a backlash
against further cost and intrusiveness can be detected. On the
one hand, a very intrusive verification regime was negotiated
for the CWC, and greater confidence-building measures including
greater openness are being considered for the BWC.
<P>
On the other hand, nations have greatly resisted more openness
on conventional arms and have shown little interest in intrusive
multilateral inspection of nuclear testing regimes. Indeed, interest
in less complex, more general, even declaratory approaches has
grown.
<P>
During the early days of the Cold War, many people advocated more
unilateral, declaratory, and unverifiable measures, some of which
did not seem warranted to U.S. policy makers at the time, given
the geo-strategic situation. Still, a few such measures were used
to reinforce Western diplomacy and security, especially in the
final days of the Cold War. Parallel unilateral reductions in
tactical nuclear weapons provide one example of how fast moving
situations may warrant more informal efforts. Reduced alert rates
on strategic forces offer another example. This cautious approach
to declaratory arms control so characteristic of U.S. arms control
strategy during the Cold War has been considered too conservative
by some, particularly negotiators in multilateral fora pressing
for a strengthening and/or codifying positive and negative security
assurances from the nuclear weapons states.
<P>
A sixth major challenge to global arms control regimes is dealing
with questions of &quot;haves&quot; and &quot;have nots.&quot;
What is the viability of global treaties to prohibit the spread
of particular weapons if states with those particular weapons
keep them and others, outside the regime acquire them. The classic
case is the situation under the NPT, but it is not the only case.
<P>
In accordance with the NPT, parties which did not already have
nuclear weapons prior to the existence of the NPT are guaranteed
access to peaceful nuclear technology by joining the NPT. They
also receive commitments from the existing nuclear weapons states
that these states will work toward nuclear disarmament as provided
for under Article VI. India, and others, have argued that grand
fathering existing capabilities even if not, in theory, permanent
is discriminatory. Certainly, the NPT, unlike the CWC, does not
provide a precise timeline to equal non-weapons status for all
parties.
<P>
The five nuclear weapons states provided for under the NPT counter
that preventing the spread of nuclear weapons is in everyone's
interest equally, that the nuclear weapons states have obligations
in conjunction with the NPT with respect to the security of non-nuclear
weapons states, and that Article VI provides the means whereby
the distinction between the nuclear five and other parties can
be eliminated. The nuclear weapons states point to INF, START
I, and START II to demonstrate that reductions are underway. Given
that the nuclear weapons states are not likely to go to zero quickly
and, further, given that a number of non-nuclear weapons states
rely on security guarantees from nuclear weapons states, the discrimination
debate among parties has been less about demand for near term
denuclearization than about progress on issues such as the CTB,
security assurances, and access to technology. The denuclearization
issue will, however, receive more attention with the end of the
Cold War and the approach of the NPT Extension Conference in 1996.
<P>
The more immediate implication of the distinction between &quot;haves&quot;
and &quot;have nots&quot; under the NPT is that it is used as
a pretext by some nations not to join the regime in order to protect
their own options to acquire and deploy nuclear weapons. The prospect
that additional states will deploy nuclear weapons poses the most
immediate challenge to the NPT. A non-proliferation regime which
can survive a lengthy process of removing the nuclear danger may
not be able to survive the emergence of new nuclear threats outside
the treaty, especially the unraveling of its own membership by
either non-compliance or withdrawal. It is not clear that the
NPT could even survive the formal creation of a third category
of nations for so-called nuclear capable states, perhaps under
some form of CTB, if such a regime were to provide legitimization
of the pursuit of nuclear weapons by non-nuclear weapons states.
<P>
In this regard, an important non-discriminatory approach to the
nuclear disarmament question is the proposal to cut off the production
of unsafeguarded fissile material followed by a step-by-step process
under which all states gradually bring their unsafeguarded nuclear
material under international control. Typically, this is seen
as a global initiative, and it has an important global dimension.
The step-by-step process, however, may
<P>
actually be promoted more effectively in bilateral and regional
or super-regional contexts because nations which are retaining
unsafeguarded material do so because of regional security concerns.
<P>
The &quot;haves&quot; versus &quot;have nots&quot; debate is not
confined to the issue of who has nuclear weapons. The related
issue of suppliers and demanders of nuclear and other technologies
and material has already been mentioned. Nor is it always the
case that the &quot;haves&quot; keep weapons while the &quot;have
nots&quot; are denied to acquire them. The INF Treaty provides
an interesting case. Under the INF Treaty, the US and the former
Soviet Union, and indirectly some other nations, gave up the right
to two categories of long range missiles currently deployed by
other nations. IRBMs, for example, banned to the US and Russia
and being eliminated by France are deployed in this region by
Saudi Arabia which obtained them from China. Other nations in
the developing world seek to acquire such missiles.
<P>
What then can we say in summary about the trends and challenges
faced by global arms control regimes and related considerations
for this region. Global arms control can help the region with
its problems, but it cannot solve them. It is not the only, or
necessarily the best arms control tool for dealing with complex
regional security issues. Indeed, global approaches can become
a pretext for inaction within a region, which is unfortunate because
global approaches may be too general or too weak to address some
serious regional dangers. One should use the tools that work whether
they are global, or regional, or unilateral.
<P>
Arms control and confidence-building cannot be separated from
opportunities and obstacles created by domestic as well as international
events. Arms control is not end in itself, but part of broader
approaches to security. Thus, it is important to recognize that
the externals may be even more important than the internals of
an agreement.
<P>
Arms control cannot be divorced from competition, but that does
not preclude cooperation. There are prices to be paid for gains,
but arms
<P>
restraint need not be a zero-sum game. Indeed, some calculations
of &quot;win-win&quot; will be required for an agreement. Solutions
should look for what is ripe and what is necessary to meet immediate
priorities. Everything is related to everything, but progress
is easier if one avoids rigid and formal linkages. Instead, one
should look for packages which meet legitimate security needs.
<P>
Global arms control has helped set standards and provide models
for achievement. It has provided a foundation of international
standards which can help with regional threats. Unfortunately,
it is not clear whether these emerging international norms will
be sustained. It is in everyone's interest that they be continued
and strengthened. To do so will require that every nation undertake
a step-by-step process, taking into account developments in the
security and political spheres to move in the right direction&Ntilde;away
from weapons of mass destruction, away from settlement of disputes
by force. There is a real danger that failure to keep the momentum
going in the right direction will result in movement in the wrong
direction with the development of momentum toward greater proliferation
and conflict. Progress in the future may be more difficult to
achieve than in the past because we will be dealing with arms
control challenges in regions far more complex than many of those
faced in the bilateral days of the cold war or in debates between
&quot;haves&quot; and &quot;have nots.&quot;
<P>
In short, global negotiating fora can help and in many areas they
are the best channel, but they will interfere if their activities
become an excuse for inaction by parties in troubled regions.
They will hurt also if global initiatives cannot deal with the
real issues of a region because their focus or scope are inappropriate,
if they undermine higher priorities, or if they dangerously water
down standards of confidence needed among nations in a region
to resolve their disputes peacefully.

<H2>CSBMs : The Ugly Duckling Remains a Duck -but a Pretty Good
One </H2>

<P>
<B>Ambassador Lynn HANSEN</B>
<P>
Former Head of U.S. Delegation to CFE-Talks
<P>
Political Advisor, HQ U.S. Air Force Europe<HR>

<P>
In 1981, while the Madrid CSCE follow-up Meeting was in full swing
attempting to agree on the mandate for the Stockholm Conference,
a German foreign affairs institute hosted a conference on confidence
building measures. In some respects it was like this one. It was
attended by a large number of academics, diplomats, and security
experts from all parts of the world. A fair amount of skepticism
was in evidence. Many security pundits found it difficult to conceive
of confidence-building measures as creating greater security and
stability. The title for this paper takes its inspiration from
the then head of the London based International Institute for
Strategic Studies (IISS), Christopher Bertram. Taking his cue
from the fairy tale by the famous Dane, Hans Christian Andersen,
Bertram said during the Germans conference that CBMs were ugly
ducklings that would never turn into swans.
<P>
After approximately eight years of implementation experience,
I would personally agree with Bertram that CBMs have not, figuratively
that is, turned into the beautiful swan of Hans Christian Andersen's
fairly tale. Nonetheless, the ugly duckling has shown itself to
be a pretty good duck, not things of absolute beauty, CBMs are
now universally recognized as practical tools which do, in fact,
build confidence and security.
<H4><B>1. Basic Precepts - A Subjective View</B></H4>

<P>
The theory of confidence-building is far less convincing than
the practice. For two glorious years I occupied a chair in political
science at the United States Air Force Academy in Colorado. The
brilliant and well-trained young officers who taught in that department
intimidated me with their knowledge and enthusiasm. However, I
was perplexed by the importance they placed on academic theories
of political science and international relations. Many times I
had cause to stop and reflect as to whether theory had played
any role whatsoever in my own experience as a policy-maker in
government. I suppose it did, but I was far more interested in
practice.
<P>
Speaking very frankly to you, even when I was a negotiator I often
wondered about whether the theoretical arguments we were making
concerning the potential for CSBMs to eliminate surprise attack
were really true or whether the thrust of the argument was mainly
political. Surprise attack, my military background told me, is
a highly complex subject which is not resolved by slogans on quick
answers. And, I reasoned, if a nation really wants to launch a
surprise attack, CBMs are unlikely to pose an unsurmountable obstacle.
Yet, the practice of implementing CBMs can contribute to improving
relationships that help eliminate the reasons for surprise attack.
<P>
So I am convinced that confidence building measures do have an
important, even critical, role to play among states that desire
political change in their relationships where military capabilities
impact on those relationships.
<P>
I began working in the field of confidence-building measures while
still an active member of the Armed Forces of the United States.
I had served twice as a liaison officer to the Group of Soviet
Forces in East Germany. My duties involved observing to the maximum
possible extent the activities of those forces. In their attempts
to limit my observations, the Russians twice shot at me. It should
not therefore be surprising that I considered the Soviet Union
as my personal enemy, in addition to be the political adversary
and potential enemy of the United States.
<P>
It was difficult for me to accept the very idea of confidence-building.
I had no interest in having confidence in the USSR or the Soviet
Armed Forces. The intellectual examinations of the subject made
sense, but I viewed them with the suspicion that military men
often have for intellectuals and diplomats. The key issue, as
I saw it, was security. I attempted to capture this thought in
an article I wrote in 1983, following is a quote from that article
:
<P>
<I>Many who have attempted to address the conceptual question
of confidence-building have begun with the psychological dimension
of what constitutes trust. This is, however, approaching the problem
backwards. International confidence is, and always will be, directly
related to the condition of one's own security.</I> 
<P>
For a time, I launched a small and distinctly unsuccessful campaign
to change the name of confidence-building measures. I felt that
many languages did not convey the nuanced difference of meaning
that exists in English between &quot;confidence&quot; and &quot;trust&quot;,
consequently, the idea was often conveyed that we were building
&quot;trust&quot;. As a relatively hard-boiled military man, I
did not want to &quot;trust&quot; anyone. My view was that one
should have confidence in one's own security, not in the intentions
of a potentially hostile power. The change in name from CBM to
CSBM (confidence-and security-building measures) at the Madrid
CSCE following up meeting helped some, even though the name change
arose from different considerations and had little practical effect
in the design of measures.
<H4><B>2. A Process</B></H4>

<P>
As you may have noted, confidence and security-building is a process,
not a single event or a single measure. It is more important to
begin the process than it is to get everything perfect in the
first step. It would be neither possible nor wise to simply lift
the CSBM provisions of Vienna Document 1992 and apply them casually
to other regions. Indeed the European process has been step-by-step
beginning with the extremely modest Helsinki confidence-building
measures of the 1975 CSCE Final Act and proceeding to the watershed
Stockholm Document, and the two Vienna documents.
<P>
Of course, it would also be serious folly not to reap the benefits
of the European process. The beginning in other regions should
not, therefore, be the 1975 Helsinki Final Act, but appropriately
modified versions of measures that have been successful in the
European environment.
<P>
Specific criteria, however, should be developed and employed.
In preparing for the Stockholm negotiations, the West insisted
that future measures had to be 1) military significant, 2) [politically]
binding, 3) verifiable, and 4) applied to an agreed area, which
in this case was the whole of Europe.
<P>
There is no need to discuss these principles further. It is only
important here to note that eventual measures should be built
on a well-defined concept with specific principles. A quote from
a United Nations study on CBMs may be helpful in this context.
<P>
<I>...neither declarations of intent or a repetition of generally
recognized principles nor mere promises for a certain behavior
in the future, e.g., in cases of armed conflict, satisfy the exigencies
of removing perceptions of threat and suspicion...Confidence-building
measures must therefore be such that they translate universally
recognized principles, such as the renunciation of the use of
threat of use of force in accordance with the UN Charter, into
reality by the application of concrete, specific, and verifiable
measures.</I> 
<H4><B>3. Openness</B></H4>

<P>
States traditionally seek to guarantee their security by building
up their armed forces in order to be able to effectively respond
to a perceived threat. Consequently, one of the chief objectives
of confidence-building measures is for states with potentially
or actual conflicting philosophies to cooperatively assure each
other that their security is not threatened by offensive action.
Since most states would evaluate capability rather than intention,
this is not as easy as many would suppose.
<P>
Because the first use of force initiating a conflict would involve
the use of conventional armed forces, a critical step in confidence-building
is the provision of reasonable and accurate information pertaining
to those forces and their activities. The objective is to communicate
that military activities, both in a general and in a specific
sense, are not precursors to pre-emptive attack.
<P>
Many intellectuals argued that confidence-building ought to include
information and obligation regarding nuclear and other non-conventional
weapons. However an insistence on such inclusion would have condemned
the effort in Europe to failure from the beginning. This is because
nuclear weapons, in particular, were considered as weapons of
last resort which served a deterrent function and would not be
used in the initiation of hostilities.
<P>
With the hindsight of experience, European states are now convinced
of the importance of openness and transparency in the confidence-and-security-building
process. Excessive secrecy in military affairs has been recognizedas
one of the greatest impediments realizing the political objectives
set forth in the 1975 Helsinki CSCE Final Act. However, this has
not alwaysbeen the case. Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko, at the
beginning of the Stockholm Conference in January 1984 was scathing
in his criticism of confidence-and security-building measures
which promoted openness and transparency. He compared them with
an illicit peak through a fence aimed at gaining intelligence
and therefore unilateral advantage. There were also many in the
West who were decidedly uncomfortable with the idea of providing
a potential adversary with detailed information on their armed
forces. This was particularly true of the military.
<P>
Near the end of the Stockholm Conference, when it became clear
that there would be agreement on-site inspection, three or four
military representatives stated that their defense establishments
were displeased at the thought of foreign inspectors looking at
their defense arrangements. In each case, the response was to
remind that the political decision had already been taken and
the Western negotiators were going to support that decision. The
armed forces in virtually every participating state are now among
the most enthusiastic supporters of the confidence-building process
and the inspection provisions that have been agreed in both CSBM
agreements and arms reduction treaties.
<H4><B>4. Information Exchange</B></H4>

<P>
Many will argue a host of reasons why they cannot agree to an
exchange of information at early in the confidence-building process.
If these arguments carry enough political weight, it may be difficult
to agree on a complete and total exchange of military information
disaggregated to the level of regiment/brigade, and independent
battalion.The attempt should then be made to agree at some lesser
level of dissaggregation. Irrespective of the level of disaggregation
in the information, it is critical that the process gets underway
and that the commitment is made to include information exchange
as part of confidence-and security-building. Later, when the process
deepens and confidence in the process itself increases, lower
levels of disaggregation will be both advisable and possible.
<P>
Contrary to what Mr. Gromyko said at the initiation of the Stockholm
Conference, an open and honest exchange of information according
to unambiguous provisions does not bestow an exploitable unilateral
advantage on any state. To those seeking genuine and lasting stability
based on mutual understanding, the advantage is at least a bilaterally
shared advantage, and in most cases even multilateral.
<P>
No state has a complete understanding of another state's intelligence
capabilities and analysis. But every state understands that every
other state has an intelligence apparatus that has reached certain
conclusions about the capabilities of other states. Often, these
conclusions are based on <I>worst case</I> analyses based on either
faulty information or political purpose, and sometimes both. The
objective is to create a situation where one state can say of
another that its understanding of the military situation in that
state corresponds to reality. In such a situation, an honest and
objective exchange of information can deprive contemptible leaders
of credible worst case analysis. Of course, this sword can cut
both ways and each state must evaluate for itself where its national
security interests are best served. Nonetheless, the experience
in Europe is unequivocal: openness and transparency are key to
establishing credible and long term cooperative relationships
among states that had previously been potential adversaries.
<H4><B>5. Pre-Notification of Military Activities</B></H4>

<P>
The Helsinki Final Act, in its <I>Document on confidence-building
measures and certain aspects</I> <I>of security and disarmament
</I>provides clear explanation and rationale in its preamble for
the pre-notification of certain military activities.
<P>
<I>Recognizing the need to contribute to reducing the dangers
of armed conflict and of misunderstanding or miscalculation of
military activities which could give rise to apprehension, particularly
in a situation where the participating States lack clear andtimely
information about the nature of such activities.</I>
<P>
The military dimension of prenotification, i.e., dealing with
the question of misunderstanding or miscalculation of military
activities, was followed in the Final Act by the conviction that
prenotification also has a political function.
<P>
<I>Convinced of the political importance of prior notification
of major military manoeuvres for the promotion of mutual understanding
and the strengthening of confidence, stability, and security.
</I>
<P>
Every army must exercise in order to be a competent fighting force
able to fulfill its military objectives and strategy. Large armies
must conduct large scale military activities such as manoeuvres
and movements. Because of the possibility that offensive action
could be launched as a surprise attack out of an exercise posture,
some states believed that prenotification measures should focus
on large-scale activities. If one were to focus exclusively on
the military dimension of confidence-building, such a position
has some merit. But in the European process, one wanted to deal
also with the political function of confidence- building. Indeed,
when the Helsinki measures were agreed in 1975 both East and West
already possessed national technical means sufficient to insure
knowledge about major military maneuvers as they unfolded. So
the purely military aspect of early CBMs took a backseat to the
political function, i.e., the political act of providing information.
<P>
In the Stockholm negotiation of CBMs, the West began by suggesting
that the numerical threshold for pre-notification of military
activities should be at about 6,000 soldiers. This represented,
in gross terms, a regiment or brigade level exercise. After additional
analysis showed that such a low notification threshold would result
in an extremely high number of notifications, the West lowered
its demands to that of a division-level exercise. For Europe,
this level represented a significant military exercise, even though
most recognized that a division-level exercise was hardly a threat
to European security; but in pursuing the political objective,
it was judged to be about right. Thus, in 1986 it was possible
to agree on a threshold for notification which became operable
whenever 13,000 troops, or 300 tanks were organized into a divisional
structure or at least two
<P>
brigades/regiments. When it was subsequently recognized that the
size of military activities in Europe had decreased, the numerical
trigger for notification was also lowered. Again, not because
of the military aspect or the fear of surprise attack, but because
the political function of confidence-building through pre-notification
was deemed sufficiently important to make the change.
<H4><B>6. Matters of Concern: Amphibious, Airborne, Transfers,
Concentrations</B> </H4>

<P>
Whenever possible, it is important to notify those activities
that cause another state concern. Because of their location on
the Baltic Sea, the Scandinavian countries were eager to include
amphibious activities in a CSBMs regime. Other states were concerned
about airborne activities, especially parachute landings. These
interests were accommodated with a minimum degree of difficulty.
On the other hand, it was not possible to meet the former Soviet
Union's demands that independent air and naval activities be included
in the regime. The reasons it was not possible were complicated
but can be summarized by noting the West's perception that the
real reason for the inclusion of such naval and air activities
was to make nuclear elements (normally dealt with in a bilateral
setting) part of a multilateral negotiation dealing with conventional
arms. Nonetheless, naval and air activities which form part of
otherwise notifiable activities were included.
<P>
A good example of the West's willingness to meet the concerns
of other states related to the question of transfers and movements.
For a long time it appeared that there could be no agreement on
this issue. The United States, in particular, was unwilling to
compromise in any way its ability to transfer troops in or into
Europe on their way to a crisis in the Middle East or elsewhere.
Member states of the Warsaw Pact regarded the large transfer of
American forces to Europe each fall to participate in the
<P>
REFORGER exercise as cause for concern and reasoned that a movement
or transfer of such magnitude should be pre-notified as part of
a confidence- and security-building regime. The U.S., for its
part, did notobject to the concept of notification, but did not
know how to agree to the East's proposition without degrading
the ability to move quickly and in force to other regions.
<P>
About a month before the negotiation was concluded, each side
understood the limits of the other's position. The U.S. understood
that it could notify troops moving to Europe for the purpose of
participating in the annual REFORGER exercises as long as such
notification covered only exercise troops and did not impose a
prenotification requirement in the rapid movement of other troops
through Europe for development in another region. Thus, the idea
began to take shape that whenever troops were to move within Europe
or to move into Europe from outside the zone, notification would
be given provided such troops were to be concentrated for the
purpose of participating in notifiable activities. The text of
the measure illustrates how both sides' interests were preserved.
<P>
<I>The engagement of formations of land forces of the participating
states in a transfer from outside the zone of application for
CSBMs to arrival points in the zone, or from inside the zone of
application for CSBMs to point of concentration in the zone, to
participate in a notifiable exercise activity or to be concentrated.
</I>
<P>
Similarly, the West was reluctant to use such terms as ''manoeuvers&quot;
or &quot;movements&quot; because of the difference in military
cultures and the specific meanings of such terms. The &quot;out-of-garrison&quot;
concept was devised to cover all contingencies where military
forces left their garrison to conduct any kind of military activity.
The East was categorical in its rejection of the term &quot;out-of-garrison&quot;
and it does not appear in the text. Nonetheless, the concept is
preserved through appropriate operational language.
<H4><B>7. Visual Monitoring</B></H4>

<P>
One of the fundamental advantages of the Stockholm Document over
the Helsinki Final Act is the obligatory nature of the requirement
to invite observers and to receive on-site inspections. Because
these requirements are non-discretionary, there is no question
about the obligation. Failure to comply has a different connotation
than failure to implement a voluntary measure. While the concept
of volunteerism is in itself theoretically appealing, it can be
exploited as a reason not to do something in practice. By and
large, then, voluntary measures should be avoided.
<P>
Recalling Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko's critical comments
about openness and transparency made at the opening of the Stockholm
Conference, it is noteworthy that in the first year of implementation
of the Stockholm CSBMs agreement the Soviet Union conducted more
on site inspections than any other state . Sixteen of the 23 members
of the two military alliances which had earlier regarded each
other with mutual suspicion were involved in inspections in 1987,
the first year of implementation. Within 15 months of the end
of the CSBM's negotiation, on-site inspections had become a part
of the regular political and military-security landscape in Europe;
they were no longer regarded as either unusual or as a manifestation
of mistrust and suspicion. In addition to on-site inspections,
47 military activities were also pre-notified, many of which were
at the level of 17,000 troops which required the invitation of
observers.
<P>
From 1987 to 1991 the number of notifiable military activities
in Europe reduced significantly as shown in figure 1. This decline
in the number of notifiable activities resulted in a decline in
the number of observations conducted.

<HR>

<P>
Of course, Europe was undergoing colossal political changes during
this period. Within the confidence- and security-building process,
an information exchange measure was agreed and the emphasis shifted
from observation of notified military activities and on-site inspection
to the evaluation of the information provided in accordance with
the new measures. CSBMs activity in 1992 was illustrative of the
change in focus: only three on-site inspections were conducted
and just four observations of prenotified military activities
were carried out. On the other hand, 24 different states conducted
visits to military facilities for the purpose of evaluating the
CSBM regime's new information exchange visit. These 24 states
included three of the successor states to the former Soviet Union
: Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine. Finland, Sweden, Austria, and
Switzerland who had previously opted not to become involved in
on-site inspections were by now actively involved in evaluation
visits.
<P>
The point to be made here is that when the number of observations
and on-site inspections declined, states agreed on other measures
which preserved the confidence-building purpose of exposing military
forces on their own territory to visual scrutiny by other states
in the region.
<P>
In 1990, as the process continued, states were also able to agree
to provide information on plans for the deployment of major weapon
and equipment systems as well as to give each other information
on their military budgets. A new measure on visits to air bases
was also agreed as was a mechanism for dealing with unusual military
activity and for cooperating with respect to hazard incidents
of a military nature. It was also agreed that Annual
<P>
Implementation Meetings would be held in which the implementation
of agreed CSBMs would be examined as well as possible improvements.
<H4><B>8. Open Skies</B></H4>

<P>
It is almost universally recognized that verification of international
agreements is the responsibility of national governments that
are parties to the agreements. This would rule out the use of
an open skies platform for verification purpose. An Open skies
regime is thus considered to service the confidence-building function
rather than as an act of verification. This is a recognized principle
in the European environment.
<P>
This has special significance for the Middle East where the perception
is strong that Israel benefits from satellite technology for surveillance
purposes while Arab states do not. An open skies regime for the
Middle East would have to be a shared as a cooperative effort
in which the participants agree on the platform to be used, the
sensor suite, and the modalities of flying an open skies mission.
One would expect representatives from both the observing and the
observed state to be on board the open skies aircraft with the
observing state directing the flight path according to predetermined
rules and modalities. The nationality of the platform in such
case is almost irrelevant. It could be leased, part of a pool,
or provided by one or the other party.
<P>
Certainly, an open skies regime as a confidence-building measure
could provide very positive assurance that one state is not preparing
aggressive action against another. Some may argue that a determined
aggressor could hide intentions from periodic open sky flights.
However, an attack which had any chance of success could require
substantial preparations which would be extremely hard to hide
from open skies sensors.
<H4><B>9. Applicability and Adaptability</B></H4>

<P>
There is no hiding the fact that the Middle East is not Europe
in either geographical or political terms. Whereas decades of
diplomatic discourse preceded the Stockholm and Vienna agreements
on CSBMs, there was little or no such dialogue between Israel
and its neighbors until recently. The process is still largely
in its formative stages and much remains to be decided on a political
level that is critical to the achievement of agreements in the
military-security sphere.
<P>
Where possible and in the interest of rapid progress, one should
profit from the European experience in considering what CSBMs
might play a stabilizing role in the Middle East. In many cases,
approaches may need to be adapted to a particular set of conditions
that may be unique. In others, the approach may of necessity be
incremental -- doing as much as possible now and improving upon
it later. These are, of course, issues to be decided by participants
themselves.
<P>
In particular, two of the European measures could play a vital
role. The first is the idea of a communications network. There
is already considerable understanding on this point and little
more needs to be said here. The second, however, is a larger challenge.
It is the question of establishing something like the CSCE Conflict
Prevention Center (CPC) in Vienna.
<P>
The first thing participating states would need to decide is precisely
what role a CPC could and should play in the Middle East. In other
words, the basic concept and objectives of the center need to
be developed long before the center comes into being. Then, provisions
must be made to provide the center with the requisite authority
to perform the function and objectives set for it. This, of course,
includes fiscal support. Another issue to be resolved is whether
the CPC is a place or a function. In theory, a function could
be conducted in several different ways. But the center as a place
calls for centralization of function. To perform its overall mission
well, the center would need access to all available information,
data, intelligence,
<P>
and communications. Some sort of investigative power should also
be vested in a center.
<P>
In its early stages, it might well be that a Middle Eastern CPC
would require an active, perhaps even directive, role by the sponsors
of the Middle Eastern Peace Process. This &quot;outside-the-region&quot;
participation would promote a more comprehensive view of activities
in the region that are relevant to peace, stability, and security
while at the same time muting criticism of partisanship.
<H4><B>10. Finally, the Psychological Dimension</B></H4>

<P>
The Soviet military negotiator, a major general, and I regarded
each other with considerable mutual suspicion at the beginning
of the Stockholm CSBM negotiations. Each was convinced that whatever
the other might suggest would be harmful to our own cause. Because
I have been a negotiator in the Madrid CSCE follow-up meeting,
my Soviet counterpart had been well-briefed on what he might expect
from me. It was clear in the early part of the negotiation that
he didn't wish to conduct his business with me personally. At
least a year went by before there was any direct communication
on a bilateral basis.
<P>
After it became clear to both of us that both sides were prepared
to work toward a possible agreement the climate between us became
less chilly. We still stood on the opposite sides of many issues.
As noted earlier, a Soviet objective was to include naval operations
in the negotiation. My instructions were clear, independent naval
activities would not find a place in the final agreement. One
day we were invited to the Czechoslovakian embassy for lunch.
As was often the case, we were seated in close proximity to each
other. Suddenly, he looked up from his plate at me and said, ''you
know, if you had proposed the inclusion of independent naval activities,
we would have said no.'' To an extent that broke the ice. We then
begun to meet bilaterally, just the two of us.
<P>
All in all, we must have spent something over a hundred hours
discussing military operations in their relevance to each of our
positions. It was largely a conversation between two military
men and I was never sure he was convinced that I really had retired
and was now an ambassador. I mention this because of the unique
ability of military men to communicate with each other, irrespective
of nation or branch of service. I therefore strongly advocate
that military officers play a key role in negotiation of confidence-building
measures.
<P>
When the negotiation was finally over, the last meeting held,
and toasts appropriately drunk, my Soviet colleague approached
me. I had valued the meetings we had together. He had never lied
nor tried to deceive me. He, too, had found value in our relationship.
For he said something in the following lines: the agreement we
had worked on together is important, but it is perhaps even more
important to learn that it is possible for us (the Soviet Union)
to reach agreements with the Americans.
<P>
So, in spite of my early skepticism about the psychological aspect
of confidence-building, I was forced to admit that the relationships
which form as a result of the process do have a psychological
affect. It can best be expressed in terms of what the Germans
call <I>Feinbild</I> or image of an enemy. In the confidence-building
process the image of a potential adversary can change. While I
would still argue that security is the principal issue in confidence-building,
there is still a vital result when one's image of a potential
adversary takes on contours which more accurately reflect reality.
<P>
A swan is a beautiful bird. But it is really only good to look
at. A duck has virtues a swan does not possess; above all it is
a practical creature that serves man's practical needs. So it
is with confidence- and security- building measures.

<H2><B>ISRAEL'S VISION ON THE GOALS AND PRINCIPLES OF THE REGIONAL
SECURITY AND ARMS CONTROL PROCESS </B></H2>

<P>
<B>Ambassador Eytan BENTSUR</B>
<P>
Senior Deputy Director
<P>
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Israel<HR>

<P>
This paper document presents Israel's vision on the long term
goals for the Regional Security and Arms Control process, as well
as its outlook on the principles that ought to govern the process.
This document was formulated in response to the request contained
in the concluding statement of the Moscow meeting of the RS&amp;AC
Working Group, September 1992. The policy presented in the document
was recently approved by the Israeli Cabinet.
<H4><B>1. The Vision</B></H4>

<P>
Israel's vision of the long-term goals for Middle-East RS&amp;AC
process, as approved by the Israeli Cabinet, states as follows:
<P>
The prophets of Israel gave voice to the message of universal
peace and disarmament to which the Jewish people held fast and
which is Israel's heritage:
<P>
<I>They shall beat their swords into ploughshares, and their spears
into pruninghooks; nation shall not lift up a sword against nation,
nor shall they learn war any more. But they shall sit every man
under his vine and under his fig tree, and none shall makethem
raid</I>. (Micah 4, 3-4)
<P>
The goal Israel constantly aspires to is to live in a region in
which full and lasting relations of peace prevail, based on reconciliation
between peoples, good neighborliness, open borders, and trust
among nations.
<P>
Thus will our region know stability and security; dangers of war
and horrors of mass-destruction will be removed, and all states
and nations of the region will be able to live in peace and dwell
safely.
<P>
Such relations of peace will put an end to arms races, and lead
to reductions, to the minimal levels required for national self-defense,
of standing military forces, defense expenditures and conventional
arms.
<P>
In the spirit of the global pursuit of general and complete disarmament,
Israel will endeavor, upon the establishment of relations of peace,
that the states of this region should jointly establish a mutually
verifiable zone free of ground-to-ground missiles, of chemical
weapons, of biological weapons, and of nuclear weapons.
<P>
From its very inception, the state of Israel appealed to its neighbors
to enter with it into such peace; this is and has been Israel's
aspiration, and will remain its vision for generations to come.
<H4><B>2. Principles</B></H4>

<P>
The RS&amp;AC process is an integral part of the Middle East peace-making
effort commenced in Madrid in October 1991. The goal of the RS&amp;AC
Working Group of the multilateral peace process is to complement
the bilateral talks by seeking multi-lateral cooperative responses
to security problems in the region.
<P>
The Government of Israel believes that the RS&amp;AC process ought
to be guided by the following principles:
<P>
a) RS&amp;AC and Conflict Resolution
<P>
The conflicts that permeate the region have been the root causes
of arms races and wars in the area. RS&amp;AC regimes will, therefore,
prevail only once the causes of conflict are satisfactorily resolved.
Thus, the Middle
<P>
East RS&amp;AC process can only achieve its practical goals if
the process is in step with the peace-making efforts aiming at
ridding the region of the conflicts afflicting it. Accordingly:
<P>
i) The RS&amp;AC process should reflect the common interest of
all the peoples of the region to co-exist in peace, free of threats
of war.
<P>
ii) Progress in RS&amp;AC will be made in parallel with the resolution
of conflicts and commensurately with the evolution of relations
of peace between the states and peoples of the region.
<P>
iii) RS&amp;AC will have to be supportive of the Arab-Israeli
peace-making process and will inevitably be influenced by it.
<P>
b) Security<B> </B>and Stability
<P>
i)<B> </B>The RS&amp;AC process should enhance the security of
each and every one of the states taking part in it, thereby contributing
to the stability and security of the region as a whole.
<P>
ii) All steps and measures to be adopted throughout the RS&amp;AC
process must be designed so as to increase the overall stability
of the region. At no point should they diminish the security of
any state, nor should they allow at any stage of the process any
state or group of states to misuse them in order to acquire a
military advantage over others.
<P>
iii) Each state is entitled to an equally high level of overall
security, defined as freedom from threats to its existence and
well-being. Thus, structural vulnerabilities, should be compensated
for by offsetting capabilities; requirements of self-defense and
deterrence of aggression are the only legitimate needs that should
be taken into consideration in the RS&amp;AC process.
<P>
iv) Every state in the region has the right to define the threats
it considers relevant to its own security. All states of the region
will be called upon to do so with view to having the RS&amp;AC
process provide adequate responses to them.
<P>
v) The RS&amp;AC process and the agreements that may derive from
it should take into account not just threats and capabilities
of individual states (and non-state entities) but also threats
and capabilities deriving from coalitions, treaties, as well as
political and military alliances and accords between states of
the region
<P>
c) Comprehensiveness
<P>
i) The RS&amp;AC process is designed to ensure security and stability
in the region at reduced levels of militarization by:
<P>
* Building mutual confidence between states;
<P>
* Reducing the risk of hostilities;
<P>
* Lowering the incentives and capabilities for surprise attack;
<P>
* Enhancing crisis stability;
<P>
* Curtailing arms races and containing the proliferation of destabilizing
weapons;
<P>
* Assuring compliance with arms control accords.
<P>
ii) In its course the RS&amp;AC process will deal with all types
of threats, capabilities as well as intentions, in all pertinent
areas, specifically:
<P>
* Military and paramilitary, including terrorism;
<P>
* Military and security forces and their deployment;
<P>
* Defense expenditures;
<P>
* Conventional hardware and weapons systems;
<P>
* Ballistic missiles, chemical weapons, biological weapons, and
<P>
nuclear weapons.
<P>
iii) Each of these categories will be addressed on its own merit,
and in accordance with its intrinsic characteristics.
<P>
iv) Progress in the process in any given area will not be conditional
on progress in other areas.
<P>
d) The<B> </B>Regional Framework
<P>
The uniqueness of the present RS&amp;AC process stems from its
regional focus. RS&amp;AC regimes and the process designed to
accomplish them are in the interest of each and every one of the
states of the region as well as of the region as a whole. Thus,
it ought to evolve and be based on mutually agreed measures, arrangements,
and agreements. Towards that end the process must aim:
<P>
i) To arrive at an agreed delineation of the area;
<P>
ii) To ensure that, based upon the agreed delineation, the arms
control accords will include <U>all</U> states of the region
<P>
iii) To ascertain that progress, both on substance and procedure,
will be arrived at through free and direct negotiation, and that
agreements will be concluded by consensus among all the parties
to the process.
<P>
iv) To arrive at agreed upon effective RS&amp;AC implementation
and verification regimes. These should be conducted by the states
of the region through mutual verification mechanisms, mutual inspections
and specialized institutions, leaving no room for discrimination
of any state, in rights or in duties.
<P>
v) To ensure the success of the process, the support of the cosponsors
as well as of other extra-regional states is clearly of importance.
They should lend it and its goals support, assist in its realization,
and respect the accords and agreements that emerge from it.
<P>
e) Practicality
<P>
For progress to be made, the RS&amp;AC process has to be pragmatic.
Progress should be made wherever and whenever possible. Its pace
will obviously be governed by the conditions prevailing in the
region.
<P>
To facilitate progress, lessons ought to be learned and drawn
from successful RS&amp;AC experience of other states and regions,
bearing in mind the unique features of the Middle East and its
RS&amp;AC process.
<P>
i) Progress must be incremental, through a step-by-step approach.
<P>
ii) Considerations of practicality mandate that the first steps
in the process should be:
<P>
* Establishing of Confidence Building Measures; confidence is
essential for the entire RS&amp;AC process. As long as the conditions
of peace and tranquility do not prevail in the area, building
and sustaining mutual confidence between states of the region
is necessary in order to defuse tensions and diminish the threats
of war.
<P>
* An overall effort to contain and arrest the spread of destabilizing
weapon systems in the region.
<P>
iii) Priority in the process ought to be assigned to dealing with
such systems that experience has proven to be de-stabilizing,
which have been used in regional wars and have caused massive
casualties, suffering and destruction.
<P>
f) Reliability
<P>
All Regional Security and Arms Control arrangements arrived at
must be both reliable and dependable. Attaining the necessary
confidence that arms control accords will be scrupulously addressed
to in contingent upon inter-alia, the existence of:
<P>
i) Mutual and effective verification arrangements (mutual visits
and inspections).
<P>
ii) Consultative and coordinating bodies, agreed to by all states
of the region.
<P>
iii) Appropriate enforcement mechanisms.
<H4><B>3. General remarks</B></H4>

<P>
Historically Israel has been the one state in the Middle East
that is not a member of military or political coalitions in the
region. Most states of the area have joined regional alliances
and collective security arrangement, and formed extensive networks
of politico-military cooperation arrangements. This reality has
to be taken into account and should be reflected in future arms
control arrangements.
<P>
Israel believes that economic cooperation between states has benefits
above and beyond economic prosperity. It brings societies closer,
and creates interdependence as well as a common interest in the
existence of a calm and open environment. Thus, economic cooperation
between the states of our region will positively affect progress
in the RS&amp;AC process.
<P>
Israel recognizes the political and cultural diversity of the
region. Yet, as a democratic state and an open pluralistic society,
Israel believes that advancing democracy in the region has an
important role to play in enhancing peace, stability and security.
Democratization will introduce shared values such as openness
and transparency between states. It will contribute to political
stability, diminish bellicosity, and reduce threats of terrorism
and subversion whether by individuals, groups or states. It will
also strengthen a common norm of adherence to the principle of
the rule of law, and respect for treaties and agreements.

<H2><B>AN OVERVIEW OF THE MIDDLE EAST PEACE PROCESS</B></H2>

<P>
The outcome of diplomatic negotiations is often determined as
much by the substantive aspect of the issues being discussed as
by the process and structures through which agreements are reached
or not reached. This phenomenon is a prevalent element of the
ongoing negotiations in the Middle East to obtain a just, durable
and comprehensive peace. As part of the Middle East Peace Process
(MEPP) begun in Madrid in October 1991, fifteen regional parties
(Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Mauritania,
Morocco, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates,
Yemen and the Palestinians) have elected to participate in working
groups that comprise the multilateral track of the peace process.
These multilateral or regional talks, cosponsored by the United
States and Russia, have created a framework in which Israel could
join with Arab states in discussions on regional issues of mutual
concern. The talks complement and support -- but do not substitute
for -- negotiations on the separate bilateral tracks between Israel
and its immediate Arab neighbors of Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and
the Palestinians. While the bilateral tracks have attracted much
deserved public attention with the historic signing of the Declaration
of Principles between Israel and the Palestinians and a peace
treaty between Israel and Jordan, the multilaterals have been
the silent partner in the peace process. Highlighting the negotiating
process of the multilateral track provides insights into the pace
and types of decisions that may be reached in these talks.
<H4><B>1. Structure of the Multilateral Track</B></H4>

<P>
The multilaterals talks were founded on a functional approach
to international negotiation. Working groups were formed around
five issue areas which are or hold the potential of being sources
of conflict and cooperation in the region: water, economic development,
refugees, environment and security matters. The Arms Control and
Regional Security (ACRS) working group, the focus of this paper,
is the only such group devoted strictly to regional arms control
and security issues involving Israel and Arab states. Overseeing
the multilateral talks is a Steering Group comprised of the cosponsors,
Israel, Jordan, Egypt, the Palestinians, Saudi Arabia (representing
the states of the Gulf Cooperative Council), Tunisia (representing
the Maghreb), Japan, Canada, and the European Union. The Steering
Group guides and coordinates the working groups. Decisions by
the Steering Group and the five working groups are based on consensus,
a voting structure which has an inordinately strong influence
on negotiating dynamics. All groups, to date, have been meeting
in plenary semi-annually. The ACRS working group also holds a
wide assortment of intersessional activities such as workshops,
educational seminars, tours of arms control-related facilities
and paper preparation to stimulate discussion and negotiation
between its plenary sessions.
<P>
Over a score of extra-regional parties, representing countries
from around the world and organizations like the United Nations
and the European Union that have an interest in seeing a successful
conclusion to the talks, also participate in the multilaterals.
The role that each individual extra-regional party plays in the
process varies. Some simply offer suggestions at plenary sessions
on how the talks should proceed, some host events that may be
instrumental to negotiations, and some acting in the critical
role of mentors directing and promoting activities and discussions
on specific issues and topics in order to reach agreements on
particular confidence-building and arms control measures.
<H4><B>2. Stages of the Talks</B></H4>

<P>
Each working group has its own dynamic and pace of development.
In the ACRS, work on security issues has advanced through at least
four incremental stages. This is an evolving process. As such,
it is important to be mindful of the difficulty in generalizing
about the exact phase the negotiations have reached, especially
as some issues and relationships are more advanced than others
and that, at times, the talks may be exhibiting elements of all
four phases simultaneously.
<P>
In the past, Middle East states generally have sought to enhance
their security primarily through the national acquisition of military
arms and related resources while eschewing cooperative regional
arrangements and arms control agreements. Consequently, the first
phase of the ACRS working group was regarded as a period in which
the parties become familiar with the history and modalities of
arms control measures adopted in the Middle East and in other
regions. Another aspect of this phase is that it provides the
parties with opportunities to become familiar with one another
and with each others' security concerns. Parties have been submitting
papers on their long-term security goals and the principles by
which they approach the ACRS process (see, for example, Ambassador
Eytan Bentsur's contribution to this volume). This phase is also
notable for the historic visits by Israeli officials to Arab states
where they had never been welcomed before in order to attend ACRS
functions. Such visits can be attributable to the climate created
by the significant progress made in the bilateral tracks.
<P>
During the second stage, the parties seek to obtain consensus
on which confidence building and arms control measures should
be pursued initially and on concrete activities that can assist
the parties in understanding specific aspects involved in implementing
such measures, Toward this goal, a list of confidence-building
measures was compiled reflecting steps that have been adopted
throughout the world, and continue to collect suggestions for
activities from the working group parties as they arise in the
course of the ACRS process. Measures are identified as being ripe
for discussion for their potential applicability to the Middle
East while others
<P>
are left to be explored later. Essentially, measures are bifurcated
into two broad groups, conceptual and operational issues.
<P>
Items in the conceptual basket focus primarily on declaratory
statements on security and discussing abstract issues such as
military doctrine, elements involved in arms control negotiations
and security trends as well as concrete measures that are being
explored in order to ascertain their applicability to the region.
Egypt, for example, hosted a verification seminar which included
a visit to the Multilateral Force and Observers in the Sinai.
Austria hosted a seminar on declaratory measures and long-term
objectives for the region.
<P>
The operational basket contains measures which the parties agree
have greater potential applicability in the near term. In preparing
the parties to negotiate texts on prenotification of military
exercises and transmitting military data, Turkey held a workshop
on information exchange and the mechanics of reporting unusual
military activities. The Netherlands discussed with working group
participants the importance of telecommunications in managing
relations and introduced them to the Conference on Security and
Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) communications network. The Canadians
hosted a maritime measures workshop focusing on avoiding incident
at sea and cooperative search and rescue arrangements. A net result
of these events has been the development of a cadre of political
and military expert-level delegates who are versed in the details
of various arms control and confidence building measures.
<P>
The third stage encompasses further discussion of the various
national perspectives on security issues, actual negotiations
on texts of agreements and adoption of various measures. An important
objective during this stage has been to reach agreement on a statement
on principles and objectives of arms control and regional security.
On the operational side of the ledger, under the stewardship of
several extra-regional parties, Middle East participants have
engaged in negotiations to reach consensus on the texts to prevent
incidents at sea, to coordinate in search and rescue missions,
and on prenotification of certain military activities. The parties
have also
<P>
accepted to create a regional telecommunications network temporarily
using part of the CSCE network infrastructure in The Hague until
a permanent system can be located in the region. Negotiating these
texts is not regarded as indication that the parties am willing
to implement the agreements.
<P>
The fourth stage, and by no means the final stage, involves the
actual implementation of agreements and establishing venues in
the region for institutions that can support and contribute to
progress on arms control measures both before and after a full
peace is reached. Among the issues being discussed are permanent
sites for institutions such as regional security centers, an ACRS
data bank, and the communications network. As these institutions
are established and the various measures are implemented in the
region, the process will encompass elements of earlier phases
in which parties investigate new issues and areas where agreements
may be reached.
<H4><B>3. Challenges to the ACRS Negotiations</B></H4>

<P>
Each multilateral negotiation tends to take on an unique set of
challenges in trying to reach a consensus on issues by parties
that have diverse views, priorities, style and experience in diplomatic
interactions. The Arms Control and Regional Security working group,
with its own peculiar structure and processes, faces some special
challenges in advancing its work. The following list of challenges
is not meant to be comprehensive, but rather to illustrate some
specific problems and issues involved in the ACRS negotiating
process:
<P>
a) The peace process must strike a balance between talks in the
multilateral working groups and those of the bilateral track.
Negotiations in the bilateral track are critical to the success
of the multilaterals, especially as bilateral<B> </B>talks may
result in the participation in the<B> </B>ACRS by those currently
outside the working group. In this way, the two tracks can complement
each other in order to promote a comprehensive regional peace.
<P>
b) Extra-regional participates must be careful to remain neutral
during the negotiations, neither appearing to be imposing their
own solution on the parties or favoring a particular party. At
the same time, the co-sponsors and mentors need to keep pushing
the parties to achieve certain agreements while being mindful
of the constraints that may limit how far and fast the parties
are prepared to go.
<P>
c) As the regional parties develop an expertise in arms control
and confidence-building measures, it is important that they maintain
consistency in their delegations. Two problems that many states
experience in long-term negotiations are the constraints on resources
and the limited number of people available for multilateral negotiations,
especially when there are so many talks and related events occurring
simultaneously. Nevertheless, delegation consistency not only
helps to expedite negotiations by ensuring large and persistent
participation in the negotiations, but also avoids the need to
review previous understandings and agreements each time a new
delegation member becomes involved in the process.
<P>
d) With so many regional parties participating in the talks it
is important to ensure that all interests are being addressed
and that one set of security concerns such as those affecting
primarily the Levant region do not overshadow or minimize issues
of concern to the Maghreb and Gulf states.
<P>
e)<I> </I>The working group must balance the tempo and breadth
of its work in such a way as to maintain a broad range of confidence-building
and arms control measures under discussion to ensure that the
pace of negotiations on any one measure does not affect the advancement
of other measures.
<P>
f) Full representation by all important bureaucratic interests
in each regional delegation is critical to the successful outcome
of the negotiations. Diplomats must ensure that each security
related agreement they negotiate is supported by their military
and others with vested interests and military officials need to
ensure that the diplomats are aware of special issues that need
to be addressed in the negotiations.
<P>
g) As work in the peace process advances, the parties need to
ensure that their publics back home are sufficiently prepared
for their country's participation in specific security arrangements.
<H4><B>4. Track Two Events</B></H4>

<P>
Before leaving this discussion of the ACRS process, recognition
should be given to the important role that non-government organizations
have played in the peace process. Against the backdrop of the
formal negotiations are a host of non-official workshops and seminars,
known as &quot;Track Two&quot; events, sponsored by universities
and other interested institutions. These workshops have proven
valuable to the official diplomatic track inasmuch as they provide
informal settings for individuals from the region to explore in
off-the-record discussions new issues to be pursued and another
opportunity for old adversaries to comprehend the security concerns
of the other parties. Track Two workshops on threat perceptions,
confidence-building measures and arms control hold the potential
of generating ideas that can be carried back into the formal tracks.
At the same time, these meetings provide opportunities to expand
public support for the negotiations by allowing officials to interact
with non-government interested parties.
<H4><B>Conclusion</B></H4>

<P>
The ACRS working group has followed a simple set of guiding principles.
The process should be comprehensive, region-wide, incremental,
based on consensus decision-making and at no stage should it diminish
the security of any state or give any state a military advantage
over the others. It is equally important to bear in mind when
reviewing the work of the ACRS working group that it is only one
of five such groups comprising the multilateral track and that
it complements talks in the bilateral track. These parameters,
taken together with the unique political setting of the Middle
East, help to define the type of agreements that can be achieved
within the
<P>
ACRS and the working group's contribution to regional security
and stability.
<P>
Even though the MEPP is still relatively new, the process has
begun to bear fruit that is unrivaled by security negotiations
in other regions at a similar stage. We have experienced the rapid
erosion of hostility between Israel and its Arab neighbors. In
September 1993 Israel signed a declaration of principles with
the Palestinians. In October 1994, Jordan became the first Arab
state since Egypt in 1979 to sign a peace treaty with Israel.
The Arab League has agreed to relax its economic boycott of Israel.
Algeria, Morocco, Oman, Qatar and Tunisia agreed to establish
postal links with Israel. Also during late 1994, Tunisia and Morocco
agreed to open interest sections in Tel Aviv and Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin became the first Israeli head of government to visit
a GCC state, Oman; all signs that these states are preparing to
establish full diplomatic relations. These are all examples of
the commitment by the parties to the peace process and set the
stage for further advances in their common dialogue on arms control
and regional security.

<H2><B>ARMS CONTROL AND CONFIDENCE BUILDING MEASURES IN THE MIDDLE
EAST</B></H2>

<HR>

<H4><B>1. Introduction</B></H4>

<P>
Resolution of international conflicts remains one of the most
significant issues which policy-makers and political analysts
have to grapple. The point in time for this attempt to shed some
lights on one of the most important topics in international relations
is especially important as the end of the Cold War has brought
a major shift in the manner states interact in the search for
finding solutions to international and regional conflicts. This
new perception of international relations in a growingly interdependent
world community also symbolizes what might be considered as a
new era in inter-state behaviour at the end of the twentieth century.
<P>
The examination of approaches to the peace settlements, security
arrangements, and arms control is usually described as a multidisciplinary
study of predominantly bilateral relations, reflecting both the
standard mode of international politics as perceived and studied
for a long time, and the preferred method of imperical studies
including traditional histories of diplomacy.
<P>
The peace process in the Middle East launched in<B> </B>Madrid
in October 1991 constituted a major step when Arab and Israeli
delegations met publicly to try to find ways to put an end to
their long lasting hostilities. This peace process was crowned
by the signing in September 1993 of the Israeli-Palestinian Declaration
of principles (D.O.P). Consequently, Israeli forces
<P>
were redeployed in Gaza Strip and Jericho area as a first step
towards a complete Palestinian Self Rule in the whole of the West
Bank and Gaza.
<P>
In addition, Jordan and Israel signed at the same time their common
agenda by the Washington Declaration in July 1994, which laid
the foundation for a peace treaty between the two sides. The negotations
between Israel and Syria over the Golan Hights, and with Lebanon
regarding the bilateral relations between the two sides are going
on positively, and the chances and possibilities of a real breakthrough
on these two tracks are increasing.
<P>
With the advancement and progress of the peace process which inevitably
will restructure regional relations on a less militaristic basis
so that many new regional and transregional arms control arrangements
are created, and a major change in security perception in turn
will occur, which will automatically lead to a major change in
military deployments in the region. In this process of transforming
relations in the Middle East from hostility and confrontation
to coexistence and cooperation, arms control and confidence-building
measures (CBMs) must play an essential role. In fact, states of
the region have widely acknowledged the urgency of these issues
and agreed to engage in the discussions and deliberations of the
Arms Control and Regional Security Working Group (ACRS). The objective
of this working group is to determine mechanisms by which security
for all parties in the region at a minimum level of armaments
will be achieved, and not the achievement of security for one
party at the expense of others.
<P>
In addition to that, arms control, CBMs and security arrangements
are also being discussed in a bilateral fashion between Israel
and each individual Arab states (Syria, Jordan, Egypt and the
Palestinians). Discussions in (ACRS) in Moscow, Washington and
Doha developed on different related issues focussing mainly on
the needs and means to resolve conflicts in the area, as well
as other security arrangements and security concerns of participants
of this working group.
<P>
It is to be noted that despite the great importance of the issues
and matters contained in the agenda of this working group, so
far, discussions in the formal plenary meetings, as well as in
the intersessional activities can be described as purely academic
and theoretical, ranging from convening training courses to workshops
and seminars on monitoring and related activities.
<P>
It is obvious that arms control and security arrangements in the
Middle East have become a central issue deeply connected with
the peace process in the region. In fact, they constitute an essential
part of the whole peace process. So, while recognizing the importance
of this process, one should not ignore the existing arms race
in the area which negatively affects social and economic development
in the region. In this context, and because regional arms control
and security arrangments mainly and directly concern the interests
of the countries of the Middle East, these countries should play
a leading role in formulating the major components of the peace
process in accordance with their security needs and requirements.
<P>
One of the main objectives of arms control in the Middle East
is to create regional security arrangements that would set the
base for further peaceful relations and peaceful co-existence
between all parties of the region. These security arrangements
should be based on the principle of mutual interests derived from
the fact that security must be insured for all parties of the
region, that it should be in line with the idea of non-use or
threat of use of force in the settlement of conflicts between
states of the region.
<P>
By far, the peace process in the Middle East is the start of a
long and important effort which concentrates on promoting regional
security and regional cooperation. Arms control and confidence-building
can play an important role in the overall effort to promote a
durable and just peace in the region. We think that the time is
ripe to undertake real steps towards the establishment of useful
mechanisms to regulate and reduce arms in the area. Arms control
efforts should not be seen as a substitute for security, but as
a means of an accrued security for all states. It is only acceptable
if it<B> </B>respects the right to each state's security. In this
respect, arms control arrangements must take into account the
geographical, strategic, political
<P>
and economical data of the region itself, some of which is the
high density of weapons in an exceptionally restricted space .
<P>
One must recognize the fact that each party has its special security
needs, and for arms control and confidence-building measures to
succeed, they should address these needs. At this stage, parties
of the region should be looking for kinds of CBMs that could support
and push forward the peace process itself, as well as answering
and satisfying security concerns of all parties of the region.
<P>
It is essential to understand that arms control and CBMs are of
great importance for the region because of the great amount of
military build-up in the area. So, addressing the issue of conventional
as well as chemical and biological weapons in the area will be
an important route of direction that parties of the region should
follow.
<P>
One of our concerns in the area is the proliferation of weapons
of mass-destruction. I believe that Israel has to do a lot in
this regard. I must point out that Israel's nuclear programme
- which in itself is a destabilizing factor - will encourage others
in the area to try to acquire this kind of weapons by all attainable
means.
<H4><B>2. Initiatives for Arms Control in the Middle East</B>
</H4>

<P>
Previous arms control initiatives in the Middle East were merely
of a political nature. These initiatives were not transferred
into a real negotiation because of the continuous conflicts and
confrontations which always created arms race and arms build-up
in the area. Taking this into consideration, one can refer to
certain key initiatives in this regard:
<P>
a) The Tripartite Declaration of 1950
<P>
This was an initiative by the United States, France and Britain
which can be described as the first official attempt by external
powers in this direction. Through this declaration, the three
powers committed themselves to freeze their arms transfer to parties
to the Arab-Israeli conflict at that time in an attempt to maintain
the balance of power in the Middle East after the 1948 war. But
this declaration failed, because of continued confrontation between
Arabs and Israel, and because of conflicting interests of the
Western powers at that time, especially France's shipment of advanced
aircrafts to Israel in 1954.
<P>
b) President Carter's Initiative
<P>
The U.S. administration under President Carter took an ambitious
arms transfer restraint effort in the late 1970 when it declared
that conventional arms sales to the third world countries threatened
world stability. The initiative also encouraged others to take
the first step towards reducing global arms trade. This initiative
was seen at that time as part of U.S. foreign policy which could
be used as a tool for promoting American security interests by
affirming America's leading role. Talks between the U.S. Administration
and the Soviet Union about the<B> </B>matter failed because of
different strategic interests of both parties in the Middle East.
<P>
c) President Bush's Two Initiatives of May 1991 and July 1992
<P>
These two initiatives mainly dealt with weapons of mass destruction,
conventional and chemical weapons, as well as ballistic missiles.
The two initiatives urgently called the Big Powers especially
those of the Security Council to play a major role in this regard.
Moreover, they called upon all states including those of the Middle
East to take major and real steps towards the reduction of their
weapons weapons of mass destruction.
<P>
d) The Egyptian Initiative of 1990
<P>
In this regard, one should recognize the Egyptian initiative of
April 1990 which was supported by most Arab states as a real step
towards creating a peaceful and stable Middle East. This initiative
called for making the Middle East an area free of all kinds of
weapons of mass destruction, as well as creating proper means
of verification to insure the states' compliance with requirements
of arms control and security arrangements.
<P>
e) Paris Declaration of October 1991
<P>
In this declaration, the Big Five of the Security Council tried
to adopt proper regulations to reduce the flow of arms to the
Middle East. At the end of their meeting in Paris, the participants
agreed to follow certain common procedures related to transfer
of conventional arms to the Middle East.
<P>
The importance of this declaration is due to the nature of restraints
adopted by the main suppliers of arms to the Middle East. One
can easily feel this degree of flexibility given to those suppliers
in deciding about these restraints when it - the declaration -
authorized them to decide whether arms transfer to the<B> </B>area
might affect the military balance or whether it might be used
in a defensive or an offensive way.
<P>
It is to be said in this regard, despite all these constructive
initiatives, one can easily notice that states of the region could
easily obtain very advanced military systems. This fact might
be duo to deep differences among the world major arms suppliers
and the recipient states about the size and level of restraints.
For arms control and restraint measures to be effective, productive
and succesfull, they must acquire support and encouragement by
the external powers, especially the Big Five since they are the
major suppliers of most advanced and<B> </B>sophisticated weapons
to the Middle East.
<H4><B>3. Arab and Israeli Perceptions on Arms Control and CBMs
</B></H4>

<P>
Examining the working process of Arms Control and Regional Security
Working Group (ACRS) reveals certain points of differences among
participants on number of issues. These differences might be due
to different priorities and perceptions each party has established.
Arab participants in ACRS wanted to see Israel's nuclear capabilities
put under control. So, they keep insisting on the establishment
of a Nuclear Weapons - Free Zone in the Middle East as well as
on Israel's signing the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT),
and accepting International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards
at its nuclear facilities.
<P>
Arab participants in ACRS have also insisted on the position that
for arms control and security arrangements to be efficient, Israel
should reduce its nuclear weapons in exchange for Arabs reducing
their conventional, chemical and biological weapons. Not only
that, but they stress the idea that Israel's concessions on the
issue of nuclear weapons might encourage other Arab and other
Middle Eastern states to join the peace process and accept limitations
on their weapons.
<P>
We believe that confidence - building measures (CBMSs) are part
of the whole peace process in the Middle East mainly and directly
designed to complement and support the process itself, especially
the bilateral tracks. ACRS should thus concentrate on different
types of CBMs which can push forward the peace process, as well
as answering and satisfying security needs of the region.
<P>
Israel, on the other hand has a different perception. Many Israeli
policy-makers believe that arms control arrangements will inevitably
weaken Israel's ability to defend itself. They also think that
these arrangements will result in a major reduction of Israel's
deterrent capability. One can notice that through the discussions
and deliberations of ACRS and other meetings and workshops, Israeli
negotiators tend to avoid discussing directly the
<P>
issue of Israel's nuclear capability, proposing instead that participants
in ACRS concentrate and focus on reductions of conventional, biological,
and chemical weapons in the area. Israel emphasizes on CBMs and
considers them as a symbol of cooperation designed to transform
relations between states of the region from a state of confrontation
to a state of cooperation.
<P>
It is to be noted that CBMs - which are essential for any arms
control agreements in the Middle East - will be difficult to achieve
because of the long history of confrontation this area had witnessed.
Preliminary or &quot;Precursor&quot; CBMs might have a positive
impact on the hole peace process by bridging centuries of hostilities
that led to the absence of communications among countries of the
Middle East. These preliminary or &quot;precursor&quot; CBMs such
as communication, and exchange of information, if introduced in
a step-by-step manner building on previous successful efforts
in the area, will automatically increase transparency and mutual
understanding, and consequently reduce the likelihood for war.
<P>
It is widely believed that without proper CBMs, no breakthrough
in arms control in the Middle East will be possible. The importance
of these measures will be great because of mutual mistrust between
Israel and its Arab neighbouring countries.
<P>
Examining CBMs in the Arab-Israeli context, one might refer to
other experiences in this field especially those of Europe. In
this context, one<B> </B>can recall James Goodby's ten-point proposal
for CBMs in the Middle East which includes the following:
<P>
- Establishment of a Conflict Prevention Centre (CPC) for the
Middle East like the one established in Europe.
<P>
- Annual exchange of military data regarding types, quantities
and deployments of major military equipments through the CPC or
third parties.
<P>
- Exchange of visits each year to the territories of each of the
parties involved to confirm the accuracy of the data exchanged.
<P>
- Notification forty five days in advance through the CPC of any
out-of-garrison activities, maneuvers, or concentration of troops
above agreed-on thresholds.
<P>
- Observation by CPC of out-of-garrison activities that are subject
to notification, including short-notice alert and<B> </B>mobilization
exercises lasting more than twenty - four hours.
<P>
- A specified number of on-site inspections of each party's territory
each year by CPC or third-party representatives.
<P>
- An explanation by a participant of unusual military activities
it is undertaking, in lieu of an adequate explanation, inspection
of such activities by the CPC, third parties, or their national
technical means (NTM) of verification.
<P>
- An open skies aerial monitoring system operated by the CPC or
third parties.
<P>
- A hot line for rapid communications among participants, including
- if necessary - a CPC or third parties.
<P>
- Annual meetings of participants' military chiefs of staff with
the CPC or with third parties to review past implementation, future
military activities, and planned acquistion and development of
major weapons systems
<P>
It might be useful also to look at the European example regarding
CBMs adopted by the Conference on Security and Cooperation in
Europe (CSCE), and try to draw some conclusion out of that example.
It would be possible in this context to categorize them as follows
<P>
a) Measures of Information
<P>
These measures are mainly designed to facilitate understanding
of all participating states of routine activities by providing
adequate information
<P>
about routine training activities which are going to take place.
These measures can be divided in to the following types:
<P>
i)<B> </B>Exchange of General Military Information
<P>
This measure aims at keeping all states informed about the structures
of national forces, their command and control arrangements, tactical
grouping at division level and above, and normal peacetime location
of major military units, military installations and permanent
training places on a routine - annual or semiannual updates -
basis.
<P>
ii) Exchange of Annual Forecasts of Major Military Activities
<P>
This measure is designed to provide prior notification about military
activities on the territory of participating states, as well as
providing a broad time-table concerning the size and scope of
major military activities which might take place in the succeeding
calendar year. This kind of measure will make it more easier to
predict about any routine activities by any of the participating
states. This measure will include activities of major units, their
movements and deployments 'Outside their usual location.
<P>
iii)<B> </B>Establishment of Communications
<P>
This measure is intended to provide communications by linking
states concerned through their defence and foreign ministers in
&quot;Hot Line&quot; arrangements. These arrangements will provide
exchanges of information, as well as quick clearing up of any
misunderstanding about information received or activities observed
under normal circumstances.
<P>
iv) Exchange of Information on Military Budgets
<P>
This measure stipulates that participating states announce in
advance the date when their annual defense budgets is submitted
for approval by their national authorities, as well as sending
copies to all other participants when the budget is approved.
Clarifications of any<B> </B>questions by any participants about
any of the items of the budget, and the way it is developed must
be also available.
<P>
b) Measures of Notification
<P>
This measure mainly deals with providing advance warnings about
any major military activity by any party of the region concerning
the size, scope, location and duration of its military activity.
These measures are intended to make transparent all out-of-garrison
activities of major military units and the notification of any
alert of military activities.
<P>
This group of measures includes the following:
<P>
i) Notification of Out-of-Garrison Activities
<P>
This measure stipulates that each party prenotify other parties
about its actual military activities to take place by its major
military units at the level of division or 10,000 men, or their
equivalent in air forces or naval force structures. Out-of-garrision
activities is defined in this respect as the deployment of the
division headquarters and/or the majority of its combat elements
away from their normal peacetime garrison location.
<P>
ii) Notification of Mobilization Activities
<P>
This measure stipulates that each party should notify other parties
about its troops mobilization activities including numbers and
units participating in this activity, their destination, and the
purpose of the activity and its time-
<P>
duration. By doing this, the party involved will provide assurances
that his mobilization activity is not being used as to increase
his offensive power.
<P>
iii) Notification of Alert Activities
<P>
This measure is designed to reduce the perception of threat. States
of the region should make clear and explicit the number, size
and scope of alert exercises to be conducted in the coming year.
These activities should be notified to all states at the time
of their commencement using different communication links.
<P>
c) Measures of Stabilization
<P>
These measures are mainly designed to increase confidence between
parties in the area by removing or reducing major military activities
which might be considered as threatening the security of any party
ill the area.
<P>
These types of measures will include:
<P>
i) Troop ceiling
<P>
This measure stipulates that parties of the region agree to keep
the size of their routine major military activities below the
scale of forces needed to launch a full-scale attack against any
of the participating states of the region. This measure is also
designed to gradually reduce the number of major military activities
which participating states consider essential for the maintenance
of national security.
<P>
ii) Limitation on Major Military Activities in Certain Areas
<P>
This measure gives participating states the chance to designate
a certain area as a limitation zone if they feel that this area
will be a source of threat to their security, especially if it
is used as an assembling or a passing area
<P>
to launch offensive attacks. It will be reasonable to make a balanced
distribution of areas designated as limitation zones so as to
prohibit unreasonable demands by any one state at the expense
of others. Criteria of what constitutes a sensitive security area
will have to be negotiated in advance and then judiciously applied
to areas proposed for such status by the various participating
states.
<P>
iii) Limitation on Number of Major Units Out-of Garrison
<P>
This measure stipulates reducing the total number of major units
which may be out-of-garrison at any one time in order to eliminate
the possibility of building up a threatening force posture by
conducting a series of allegedly unrelated military activities
in the same time frame. It is also designed to dismiss any fears
of a likely opponent gaining an advantage by slipping through
a loophole in the CBM network. Also it might be possible that
this measure includes limitations on the total number of major
military units within a certain distance of specified designated
areas or international borders.
<P>
iv) Limitation on Major Units from Outside Europe
<P>
This measure stipulates that units from outside Europe must be
limited since introducing new units from outside Europe might
have a destabilizing influence. This measure was mainly designed
to prevent both the United States and the Soviet Union to bring
additional troops into Europe, and thus affecting the military
balance and military stability reached at by previously mentioned
measures.
<P>
v) Limitation on Military Budgets
<P>
This measure would necessitate that participating states put limitations
on their military expenditures, and reduce them in subsequent
years to a
<P>
growth not exceeding the rate of inflation prevailing in their
respective national economies.
<P>
d) Measures of Verification
<P>
This kind of measures dictates a mandatory obligation of participating
states to allow observers from other participating states to monitor
and observe major military activities to make sure that thesame
activity notified is exactly taking place. Also, this category
of measures stipulates the establishment of an overall verification
system acceptable to all participants. It will provide a continuous
monitoring of military activities taking place within the area.
Observation and verification system will provide sufficient flexibility
to satisfy the security needs of all parties as well as giving
all states active roles in verification procedures. These measures
of verification might include the following:
<P>
i) Observation of Notifiable Military Activities
<P>
This measure is designed to allow participants to check the nonaggressive
intent of the activity taking place. It also stipulates that obligations
to invite observers from all participating states will be mandatory
rather than voluntary. In this regard, observers can do the following:
<P>
- Monitor preparations and deployments of forces.
<P>
- Report on the standard of troops training.
<P>
- Report on the status of military equipments like tanks and artillery.
<P>
- Check command and control,communications, tactics and morals
of troops.
<P>
- Monitor the return of participating forces to their garrisons.
<P>
ii) Verification of CBMs Implementation
<P>
The main motive for this kind of measure is to verify compliance
with agreements, and to avoid any possible violation to that agreement.
A two level approach is suggested in this regard. The first one
would be non-intrusive containing the following stages:
<P>
- Routine monitoring by national technical means (NTM),
<P>
- Submission of a request for consultation or clarification if
uncertainties arise;
<P>
- A specified time limit for a reply; and
<P>
- Communication of the outcome to all participating states.
<P>
If this non-intrusive level of verification did not achieve satisfactory
results, then the intrusive level would become operational. It
could contain the following stages:
<P>
- Request for an on-site ground and /or aerial inspection of tile
area where violation might had happened;
<P>
- A specified time-limit for a replay;
<P>
- On site inspection;
<P>
- Findings reported to all participating states;
<P>
- Arbitration of disputes;
<P>
As it was stated before, the main goal of arms control and CBMs
in the Middle East is to reduce the likelihood of war. Consequently,
effective arms control arrangements and CBMs should be carefully
designed to strengthen deterrence and foster a stable balance
of power which will make war less likely. These measures should
be also designed to help reduce the scope, destructiveness, or
duration of war.
<P>
Consequently, we believe that the following conditions and requirements
should be fullfilled. The full compliance of all states of the
region to the norms, objectives and purposes of the U.N. Charter
and the principles of mutual respect of sovereignty and territorial
integrity, mutual non-aggression and noninterference in internal
affairs of any state in the region, since it is essential to keeping
weapons at the minimum level required only for defense purposes.
<P>
- It is necessary to define and determine the geography of the
Middle East, the area where measures and objectives of arms control
will be implemented.
<P>
- There should be some declaratory measures by all parties in
the region. These measures might include principles, elements
and guidelines which will help building and enforcing peace and
stability in the region.
<P>
- The signing by all parties of the region of treaties that call
for an area free of weapons of mass-destruction, and the control
of conventional weapons. In<B> </B>this respect, one can recommend
that parties of the region should work on and join in:
<P>
* The Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT);
<P>
* Regional Convention For Chemical and Biological Weapons; and
<P>
* Ballistic Missiles Proliferation Treaty. (MTCR) for the Middle
East including both suppliers and recipients.

<H2><B>MARITIME CONFIDENCE-BUILDING MEASURES IN THE MIDDLE EAST
</B></H2>

<P>
<B>Mr. Peter JONES</B>
<P>
Regional Security Officer, Non-Proliferation, Arms Control and
Disarmament Division, Canadian Department of Foreign Affairs and
International Trade<HR>

<P>
The political context of the Middle East Maritime Confidence-Building
Measures(MCBM) discussions arises from the so-called Madrid Formula
of the Middle East Peace Process (MEPP). The Madrid Formula, established
during the ground-breaking Madrid Middle East Peace Conference,
created a two-track MEPP under the over-all sponsorship of the
United States and Russia.
<P>
The first track was devoted to a series of bilateral negotiations
between the participants in the Peace Process. The second called
for the creation of a series of multilateral working groups on
various issues germane to the creation of a Middle East at peace.
It was recognized from the beginning that the bilateral track
was the more important, and that the progress in the multilaterals
would ultimately depend on the progress in the bilaterals.
<P>
These multilateral groups would include all of the Middle East
participants in the MEPP and several states outside the region
which had demonstrated a willingness to become involved in the
search for a settlement to the Middle East dispute and were able
to contribute to the process. The five multilateral groups established
in Moscow in January 1992 were: the Arms Control and Regional
Security Working Group (ACRSWG); Water Resources; Environment;
Regional Economic Development; and Refugees.
<P>
What I have to say relates to the ACRSWG. After initial meetings
of an exploratory nature in both Moscow and Washington, the Middle
East participants were asked to submit views on specific topics
they would be
<P>
willing to discuss. Eventually, six topics were agreed, one of
which was MCBMs.
<P>
MCBMs were seen as a potentially productive topic because, of
all the spheres of military rivalry in the Middle East, the maritime
sphere is generally regarded as the least contentious, <U>initself.
</U> Though naval forces are firmly caught up in the various military
disputes of a purely maritime or naval character. Thus, it was
reasoned that it might be easier for concrete steps to be taken
in the maritime sphere at the beginning of the ACRSWG process.
It was thus agreed at the third ACRSWG Plenary in Washington that
an examination of MCBMs could begin.
<P>
Canada is a firm supporter of the MEPP and a consistent contributor
to peacekeeping forces in the region. We also enjoy good relations
with all countries in the region. Finally, Canada possesses both
a highly professional and respected Navy and Coast Guard with
the requisite expertise to contribute substantively. For all of
these reasons, Canada was asked to serve as Mentor (we prefer
the term Facilitator) of the ACRSWG examination of the applicability
of MCBMs in the Middle East.
<P>
After consultations, Canada proposed that initial considerations
should center on two specific MCBMs; enhanced regional cooperation
in maritime Search and Rescue (SAR); and the elaboration of the
basic framework of a regional Prevention of Incidents at Sea (INCSEA)
Agreement. These two were selected because they represent areas
where work could go forward towards practical and political useful
agreements on relatively uncontentious issues. Search and Rescue
is first and foremost a humanitarian activity and no state wants
to see an unplanned incident escalate into a tense situation.
Also, both areas require naval officers to work cooperatively
towards the establishment and realization of agreed goals.
<P>
With agreement to make SAR and INCSEA the focus of consideration,
the task was to identify ways of getting the regional parties
together to explore these issues. After consulting with the co-sponsors,
Canada proposed a Workshop on these two issues. It was further
proposed that this workshop take place on neutral ground, at the
Canadian Coast Guard College in Sydney, Nova Scotia in September,
1993. It was also decided that the Workshop would not seek to
explore the basic concepts in play in a generic fashion.
<P>
Accordingly, Canada, in cooperation with the two co-sponsors,
developed a program for the Sydney Workshop which emphasized practical,
hands-on examination of both SAR and INCSEA concepts. The participants
were broken into small, mixed nationality groups and each group
was given specific tasks in terms of both SAR and INCSEA. These
tasks concentrated on solving generic problems with the concepts
in play. Though all have SAR capabilities, cooperation in this
field is not yet a common feature in the region. INCSEA, meanwhile,
is entirely new to the navies of the region.
<P>
The INCSEA scenarios were intended to demonstrate that early communication
of intentions between ships is the best means of avoiding misunderstandings,
and that the ready availability of a group of specially tailored
signals can be a factor in preventing a benign misunderstanding
from becoming a potential source of conflict. Discussions at Sydney
amongst the participants, demonstrated the importance of timely
and thorough consultations.
<P>
The SAR discussions focused on the effectiveness of pooling resources
to deal with humanitarian emergencies. In addition, the technical
requirements of such pooling were identified. At the lower end
of the scale of complexity these were seen to be communications
capabilities which would cut across regional and political boundaries.
Moving higher on the scale, participants identified the need to
familiarize each other with their procedures, training and equipment,
and ultimately to standardize these on regional or sub-regional
basis. The SAR discussions also looked at existing
<P>
arrangements for international SAR cooperation and examined their
potential applicability to the Middle East.
<P>
At the end of the Sydney Workshop it was agreed by all that neither
SAR nor INCSEA presented any insurmountable obstacles of a technical
nature. On SAR, it was agreed that a good beginning would be made
if the regional states were to exchange information on their SAR
communications frequencies and their command and control provisions
for SAR. This would enable them to contact each other quickly
in cases of emergency and to have some idea of the capabilities
which others could contribute quickly to a SAR response. On INCSEA,
the essential simplicity of the existing arrangements was endorsed,
as was endorsed, as was their emphasis on professional Navy-to-Navy
contacts.
<P>
Accordingly, the regional participants asked Canada to prepare
two things for the next Workshop. First, they wanted Canada to
prepare a questionnaire on regional SAR practices. The intention
was that the responses to this questionnaire would form the basis
of an initial exchange and discussion of information on basic
SAR capabilities and practices in the region. Second, they asked
Canada to prepare a draft multilateral INCSEA text for the Middle
East. This text would serve as the basis for an examination of
what such an agreement might look like in the Middle East. Interestingly,
this would be the very first multilateral INCSEA ever produced
as all previous Agreements had been bilateral.
<P>
Canada worked on these requests in the hope that another Workshop
would be held in the late autumn of 1993. For various reasons
(some technical, some political) it was not until March of 1994
that the next Workshop could be held in Antalya, Turkey. In the
Meantime, the results of the Sydney Workshop were endorsed by
the ACRSWG Plenary held in Moscow in November, 1993.
<P>
Discussion of SAR at Antalya was uneven. Disappointingly few of
the regional participants actually returned their SAR questionnaires.
This meant that the detailed exchange of information upon which
much of the meeting had been predicated could not take place.
The Canadian facilitators had some success in drawing information
out of the participants in discussion, but not to the extent we
had hoped.
<P>
Nevertheless, the regional participants continued their exploration
of the desirability and mechanics of enhanced regional cooperation
in SAR. They agreed that a regional communications network being
set up initially by the Dutch as another ACRSWG activity should
be used for SAR coordination. Encouragingly, a few regional states
even offered to host an eventual regional Rescue Coordination
Centre.
<P>
It is difficult to discern the exact reason for the less than
expected performance on SAR in Antalya. Much of it stems back
to the fact that very few of the regional participants filled
out the Canadian questionnaire. We do not know why this was so.
It may be that many were unwilling to provide the level of detail
requested on what is, after all, an essentially military function.
It may be something as benign as the fact that the questionnaire
simply fell between the cracks of bureaucratic responsibility
in most countries.
<P>
Whatever the reason, it seems clear that the discussions will
remain at a rather basic level for some time unless the regional
participants decide to be more forthcoming regarding their own
capabilities.
<P>
The INCSEA discussions, by contrast, made considerable progress.
Canada's draft INCSEA text was accepted as a basic framework for
the discussions. In many respects, the draft followed the existing
Canada-Russia INCSEA text. This was especially true with respect
to the obligations to be under taken by parties concerning the
avoidance of harassment. The draft differed in that its consultative
mechanisms had to reflect the need to encompass a multilateral
framework.
<P>
This is a critical change in that a substantial part of the value
of any INCSEA Agreement is the requirement to consult on safety
on a regular basis at the navy-to-navy level. That obligation
is the foundation of the face to face contact between naval professionals
which an INCSEA Agreement seeks to promote. In a multilateral
Agreement, these reviews would have to include both a regular
multilateral meeting at which all parties could discuss the operation
of the Agreement, and a regular set of interlocking bilaterals
at which individual Parties could sit down to discuss matters
of mutual concern.
<P>
The whole question of reviews is also bound up with the membership
question, which raises questions over the formal recognition by
others. Because of this problem, a lengthy discussion was held
over what form an eventual INCSEA Agreement might take. It was
pointed out that a form of document which was not legally binding
would be just as effective operationally. Others responded that
such a fix might lack certain of the political benefits sought
by some, in terms of normalizing relations between states in the
Middle East. Obviously, this is part of a larger political problem,
the solution to which will have to come through the bilateral
process.
<P>
Finally with respect to the provisional title of the draft document,
some pointed out that there is little history of naval ''incidents''
as such in the Middle East. It was also feared that the current
title sounded too provocative in the light of the desire to highlight
the cooperative nature of the proposed under taking. Therefore,
it was suggested that the title should be cast more in terms of
''facilitating the safety of navigation'' in the region.
<P>
In operational terms a number of other questions arose. For example,
language was introduced by some which sought to constrain the
use of certain technology devices when ships were in proximity
to each other. The problem with these ideas was that, in some
cases, the non-use of certain technologies may be impossible to
verify. Furthermore, the very
<P>
idea appears to change the purpose of an INCSEA Agreement, making
it into a much more operationally constraining regime than the
present one.
<P>
The principle behind existing INCSEA Agreements is that participants
will naturally refrain from activities which might endanger their
partners. It is not seen as necessary to spell everything out,
but rather to rely upon the desire of the participants to have
the Agreement succeed. Problems which arise should thus be dealt
with by the review process. Trying to define every possible case
where problems might happen, and come up with firm provisions
to prevent them, is seen as both inconsistent with the spirit
of the exercise and impossibly complex. It might also lead to
a potentially divisive negotiation over what should be restricted
and what should not. Moreover, certain possibilities inevitably
would be omitted in any such discussion and come back to haunt
the Parties later.
<P>
Obviously, this point of view is based on a premise of a certain
level of trust existing between the participants. This approach
recognizes that, even though they may have certain operational
difficulties, the navies of the participating states will recognize
their mutual interest in avoiding incidents. Examination of this
issue continues.
<P>
Another operational difference which arose concerned the question
of what are known as <U>exclusion zones</U> around ships engaged
in maneuvers. When the original INCSEA Agreement was negotiated
the then USSR sought to apply restrictions as to how close US
Navy ships could get to Soviet ships. Accordingly, they proposed
that definite distances, known as range limitations, be incorporated
into the INCSEA Agreement.
<P>
In the initial INCSEA negotiations with the USSR, the US disagreed
vehemently with this approach. It took the view that the normal
exercise of good seamanship would dictate the distance one ship
should maintain from another for safety's sake. The US Navy did
not want any restrictions placed on its freedom to get as close
to Soviet ships for surveillance purposes as circumstances would
permit. They preferred that it be left to the individual captains
concerned, recognizing that responsibility for any mistakes would
also rest with them. After intense discussion the USSR accepted
the US position as part of a final trade-off to achieve an Agreement
in 1972. At the same time, the Russians reserved the right to
raise the question again and did so in succeeding years.
<P>
At Antalya, some naval experts also sought <U>range limitations
</U>. This approach was strongly resisted by others, including
the US Navy observers to the talks. In particular, the US Navy
is concerned that a regional INCSEA Agreement which includes specific
distance requirements could set an unfortunate precedent for future
regional Agreements of this type. This is a clear example of the
needs of an extra-regional, but nevertheless heavily involved
power, having an impact upon a regional discussion.
<P>
Yet another interesting question which has arisen concerns the
eventual applicability of a Middle East INCSEA Agreement. All
current INCSEA Agreements clearly apply ''Beyond the Territorial
Seas'' of the Parties. That phrase is, in fact, in their titles.
This means that in any case of incursion by ships of one Party
into the territorial waters of another, the navy of the transgressed
Party will not be bound by the INCSEA provisions in making its
response. It may choose to exercise these provisions, but does
not have to.
<P>
Because of the geographical complexities of the Middle East, this
provision may cause problems. In the Red Sea, for example, there
is no international water. The Red Sea is so narrow that the territorial
waters of the states around it are directly joined in the Red
Sea. This being the case, actions taken by one Navy in its territorial
waters could be considered provocative to ships of another Navy
in their own territorial waters but within eyesight.
<P>
Unless the Middle East INCSEA Agreement is made to apply within
territorial waters, these situations would not fail under its
scope.
<P>
At the same time, however, the spread with which threats can develop
in the region is such that most navies are unwilling to accept
restrictions on their actions within their territorial waters.
If a naval ship discovers a small, unidentified ship speeding
through its waters under suspicious circumstances, a threat to
the coastline can develop in a matter of seconds, and the defending
ship does not want to be encumbered with the need to raise INCSEA
signal flags and wait for a reply before responding.
<P>
This problem never arose in the negotiations over the original
INCSEA Agreements. In those cases, the participants were all ''Blue
Water'' navies with Blue Water problems. The Middle East is different
and points the way to difficulties which might be expected in
applying such an Agreement to other regional contexts where the
intended participants are primarily coastal defense navies.
<P>
The regional participants left Antalya promising to engage in
further study and discussion of the question. Suggestions have
ranged from leaving it to Parties to informally exercise the provisions
of the Agreement in territorial waters where circumstances warrant,
to establishing special provisions for use within territorial
waters.
<P>
Finally, some states raised concerns that proposals requiring
surface ships operating with submerged submarines to display certain
signals, might jeopardize the secrecy of submarine operations.
This argument was a constant factor in the original US-USSR INCSEA
negotiations. The US was vehemently opposed to any restrictions
on submarine operations. After discussion, however, it was decided
that this provision is essentially a safety one and is aimed not
at submarines, but at surface ships which might be operating with
them. Within the Middle East discussions, consideration of this
subject continues.
<P>
These are the main issues of consideration. It is important to
note that they comprise a minority of the original Canadian draft
text. Over 70% of that draft has been tentatively accepted as
a valid framework for an eventual Agreement by the regional participants
after in-depth discussion and some modifications. We expect to
continue our examination of the text at another meeting this autumn.
<P>
In the meantime, Canada has been asked to prepare two events this
summer in support of the Middle East SAR and INCSEA discussions.
The first will be a practical demonstration of both SAR and INCSEA
concepts involving Canadian and American warships currently on
station in the Mediterranean. The second will be a Workshop for
senior naval officers From the Middle East, which we hope will
take place at the end of the summer in Canada. Both of these proposals
were endorsed by the most recent ACRSWG Plenary in Doha, Qatar
in April.
<P>
Canada hopes that these events will enable us to make progress
on both INCSEA and SAR at the next working level meetings devoted
to this subject in the autumn.

Abstract
<P>
The 1972 Navy-to-Navy U.S.-Soviet Incidents at Sea (INCSEA) Agreement
was a product of the Cold War and a landmark in tension-reduction
as well as confidence-building measure between the major power
navies. Establishing special rules to minimize ship maneuvers
that create dangers of collisions, to prohibit actions (simulated
attacks, etc.) that might be interpreted as hostile or harassment,
and to establish special communications procedures, the U.S.-Soviet
INCSEA Agreement has been remarkably successful in minimizing
incidents between the two navies -- despite their more frequent
global interaction in the two decades since the agreement, the
1972 agreements have also served as a model for more recent similar
bilateral INCSEA agreements, as well as for the broader 1989 U.S.-Soviet
military leaders' agreement on prevention of Dangerous Military
Activities(DMA). However, the &quot;highseas&quot; coverage limits
of the INCSEA Agreement do not address boundaries and operations
in territorial waters, nor do the INCSEA provisions cover the
inherently stealthy submerged submarine -- and the lack of INCSEA
procedures to avoid U.S.-Soviet incidents in areas of ongoing
conflict (such as the Persian Gulf during the Iran-Iraq War) was
only remedied in the 1989 DMA Agreement.
<P>
The experience of the 1972 US-Soviet Incidents at Sea Agreement
(and the 1989 US-Soviet Dangerous Military Activities Agreement)
suggests several supplementary approaches to minimize incidents
at sea in the post-Cold War world. Existing and additional bilateral
agreements still provide a sound technical and political basis
to reduce special bilateral incidents at sea. There may be benefit
in certain specific regions to a regional &quot;Safety at Sea'
approach which broadens these provisions through a regional agreement
addressing also non-naval (fishing and merchant) shipping and
including regional territorial waters (as well as the high seas).
Additionally, the time-tested provisions of the US-Soviet bilateral
INCSEA Agreement requiring naval forces on the high seas to communicate
and avoid dangerous maneuvers and harassment might be incorporated
into a multilateral agreement open to all nations. It is significant
to note that these bilateral, regional, and multilateral approaches
are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Nor can they deal with
the problems of inherently covert submerged submarines, law of
the sea disputes over boundaries of territorial seas (and Exclusive
Economic Zones) and the danger of incidents in waters adjacent
to an ongoing conflict. A flexible variety of bilateral and multilateral
actions is needed to minimize these latter more difficult causes
of incidents at sea. These include continuing appropriate bilateral
and multilateral negotiations on agreed interpretations of law
of the sea boundaries, (and perhaps provisions for submarine underwater
communications in extreme situations of perceived close danger),
and agreements for special designation and appropriate communication
of ships and aircraft in dangerous zones of ongoing conflict.
A proper complementary mix of these suggested actions can help
further reduce global incidents at sea in the post-Cold War world.
<P>
The 1972 U.S.-Soviet Incidents at Sea (INCSEA) Agreement was a
product of the Cold War and a landmark tension-reduction and confidence-building
measure between major power navies. The success of the U.S.-Soviet
INCSEA agreement over a period of two decades has inspired similar
bilateral agreements and proposals for even more ambitious multilateral
agreements. In 1989, the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. reached a broader
military agreement on prevention of Dangerous Military Activities
(DMA), which owed much to the experience of the INCSEA agreement.
Using the U.S. as a benchmark, this analysis will examine the
nature of incidents at sea, the historical background and reasons
for success of the U.S.-Soviet INCSEA agreement, and consider
the implications for maritime security of this and similar INCSEA
agreements in the post-Cold War security environment.
<H4>1<B>. Incidents at Sea-Variations on a Dangerous Theme</B>
</H4>

<P>
There is a variety of potentially dangerous interactions between
ships or between ships and aircraft that may be categorized as
&quot;incidents at sea.&quot; Perhaps the most common are maneuvers
by ships which create dangers of collisions. These maneuvers may
be intentional violations of the recognized &quot;International
Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea,&quot; for example
by a ship maneuvering without signal or in violation of the right
of way provisions of these agreements. Often equally dangerous
are maneuvers in violation of the spirit of these agreements,
as when a ship having right of way proceeds to the point of causing
a danger of collision. Maneuvering in front of aircraft carriers
or other ships launching aircraft, or maneuvering in front of
ships conducting underway replenishment are particularly dangerous
maneuvers. These maneuvers in turn have sometimes given rise to
dangerous attempts to shoulder or block off the offending ship
by the ships whose operations were challenged or disrupted.
<P>
Other common incidents have included simulated attacks by aiming
weapons or fire control radar systems at opposing ships, training
searchlights on bridges of opposing ships (thereby blinding the
crews at night), firing or dropping flares from aircraft in close
proximity to ships, 'buzzing' of ships by low overflight by aircraft,
and even accidental firing on ships during naval exercises.
<P>
The results of the various categories of incidents noted above
may vary, but their implications are serious. Perhaps most common
is a &quot;close call&quot; where no actual contact or damage
between ships or ships and aircraft results. On numerous occasions,
however, dangerous maneuvers have resulted in collisions between
ships. These collisions have sometimes resulted in loss of life
and damage to valuable equipment. Simulated attacks and other
harassment could, in times of tension or crisis, have resulted
in an action-reaction cycle of escalation to hostilities at sea
or even a deliberate preemptive attack. Although the U.S. and
Soviet navies fortunately avoided such hostilities on the high
seas during the tense Cold War era, past and recent history offers
numerous examples where at least local hostilities resulted from
&quot;incidents at sea.&quot; &quot;Incidents at sea&quot; with
the British Royal Navy were largely responsible for the U.S. involvement
in the War of 1812, and a century later German submarine attacks
helped lead to the U.S. involvement in both World Wars. In the
Dogger Bank incident of 1904, Russian attacks by mistake on British
trawlers nearly precipitated a war. More recently, naval incidents
in or over the Gulf of Sidra (in 1981, 1986 and 1989) and in the
Persian Gulf (1987-1988) led to U.S. clashes with Libyan and Iranian
naval forces (as well as the Iraqi EXOCET missile attack &quot;By
Mistake&quot; on the U.S. frigate Stark in the Persian Gulf in
1987). Disputes over oil exploration activities by ships in disputed
territorial seas brought Greece and Turkey to the brink of war
in March 1987. Disputed territorial waters and rival claims to
islands led to clashes between the navies of Vietnam and the PRC
in the Spratlies Islands in the South China Sea as recently as
March 1988. The possible implications of these historical examples
of incidents at sea are mixed. As we shall see below in the case
of the U.S. and Soviet navies in the Cold War era, an agreement
to avoid incidents at sea greatly reduced the frequency of such
incidents and thus contributed to the avoidance of hostilities.
However, as other examples above suggest, disputes between nations
over territorial waters, and the presence of even neutral naval
forces in waters when a conflict is ongoing, are two circumstances
that have frequently led to naval hostilities that in origin and
extent go beyond simple &quot;incidents at sea.&quot;
<H4><B>2. The 1972 US-USSR Agreement on the Prevention of Incidents
at Sea</B></H4>

<P>
a) Historical Background
<P>
U.S.-Soviet incidents at sea were relatively limited for the first
twenty years after 1945, largely because the Soviet navy did not
begin to appear as a global open-ocean challenge to the U.S. Navy
until the mid- to late-1960s. In the 1940s and 1950s, the few
ship incidents occurred in the Baltic Sea and the Sea of Japan--which
were also areas where the U.S.S.R. shot down U.S. reconnaissance
aircraft. Perhaps the most dangerous incidents during this period
involved U.S. naval forces pressing Soviet submarines to surface
during the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.
<P>
After the Cuban Missile Crisis--and arguably because of the effectiveness
of U.S. naval power in that crisis--the U.S.S.R. dedicated its
resources to developing an open ocean navy capable of challenging
U.S. naval power on a global basis. By the latter half of the
1960s, Soviet naval forces were permanently deployed in the Mediterranean
and routinely trailing U.S. aircraft carriers in action off Vietnam.
In 1965 and 1966, official U.S. papers recorded 24 and 33 significant
incidents at sea with the Soviets.&quot;
<P>
The U.S. public and leadership became aware of the fact that the
U.S.-Soviet tensions at sea when the U.S. destroyer Walker, operating
with an anti-submarine task force in the Sea of Japan, collided
with a Soviet destroyer on May 10, 1967, and with another Soviet
ship the next day. This resulted in two U.S. diplomatic protests
to the Soviets, a call by the then-Minority Leader of the U.S.
House of Representatives Gerald Ford for the U.S. Navy authorization
to fire on intruding Soviet ships, and a statement of concern
by President Johnson. During the Arab-Israeli Six-Day War in June
1967, Soviet warships interfered with the operations of the U.S.
aircraft carrier America. After the North Korean seizure of the
U.S.S. Pueblo in January 1968, the U.S. Navy cited Russian ships
for a dozen violations of collision regulations in the Sea of
Japan, and a Soviet merchant ship and U.S. destroyer collided.
<P>
b) Negotiating the U.S.-Soviet INCSEA Agreement
<P>
The increasing frequency, publicity, and seriousness of these
U.S.-Soviet incidents at sea throughout 1967 and 1968 led to a
formal U.S. proposal to the Soviets on April 16, 1968 for &quot;Safety
at Sea&quot; discussions. The Soviets ignored the U.S. proposal
for two years. In August 1970, the U.S. protested other Soviet
ship actions, and repeated the offer of negotiation. In the Mediterranean
during the Jordanian crisis of September 1970, U.S. and Soviet
fleets were in further close contact, and the next month a U.S.
general and his aircraft were seized when accidentally landing
in Armenia. On November 10, 1970, immediately following a collision
between the British aircraft carrier Ark Royal and a Soviet destroyer,
in which Soviet sailors were killed, a Soviet diplomat in Moscow
agreed to the U.S. proposal for bilateral diplomatic meetings
on safety at sea. It is likely that both the cumulative effect
of the increasingly serious U.S.-Soviet confrontations at sea,
and the broader turn in the atmosphere of U.S.-Soviet relations
toward detente which was apparent by late 1970 influenced Soviet
willingness to address the problem of incidents at sea. Undoubtedly,
Soviet naval officers also appreciated the implied recognition
of the Soviet Navy as a global naval power, and perhaps the increased
standing this provided in the Soviet military bureaucracy.
<P>
After intensive interagency preparations in Washington and U.S.
consultations with Allies, the formal negotiation of the INCSEA
Agreement began with the arrival of a U.S. delegation in Moscow
on October 12, 1971. Significantly, the negotiations were led
by then Under-Secretary of the Navy John Warner and U.S. naval
officers, meeting with their Soviet Navy counterparts and diplomats
from both sides. The Soviet Navy proudly hailed the U.S. team
as &quot;the highest-ranking military delegation to arrive in
Moscow since the Second World War. The U.S. concern in these negotiations
centered on elaborating on the Collision Regulations to prevent
dangerous maneuvers by Soviet ships, particularly those that harassed
and disrupted aircraft carrier flight operations. To the relief
of the U.S. delegation, the Soviets readily agreed to exclude
from the agreement any mention of the inherently covert submarines
of both sides. The Soviets were particularly concerned about the
U.S. aircraft overflights for reconnaissance and dropping of sonobuoys
in the water, and wanted &quot;fixed distances&quot; for minimum
ship-to-ship and aircraft-to-ship approach. The U.S., desire to
maintain operational commanders' flexibility for close approach
for identification and intelligence collection, opposed fixed
distances. A second round of talks, hosted by the U.S. Navy in
Washington (with side trips to San Francisco and Disneyland) was
held during early May 1972. Despite President Nixon's May 8 announcement
of the mining of the harbors of the U.S.S.R.'s North Vietnamese
ally--an announcement watched on television by the Soviet naval
delegation in the home of the new U.S. Secretary of the Navy John
Warner--agreement (without fixed distances) was initialed on May
17,1972. The formal signature of the agreement, by Admiral Gorshkov
and Secretary Warner, took place on May 25 during President Nixon's
Summit in Moscow.
<P>
c) Terms of the U.S.-Soviet INCSEA Agreement
<P>
The terms of the U.S.-Soviet INCSEA Agreement (see Figure 1) have
two aspects: technical and political. The central technical focus
of the Agreement supplements the International Collision Regulations
(&quot;Rules of the Nautical Road&quot;) to restrict dangerous
maneuvers, discourage harassment, and provide specific channels
of communication. Two technical aspects of the agreement merit
mention in light of subsequent experience. First, submarines are
not included in the text of the Agreement, and only are subject
to the agreement when operating on the surface like a ship. Second,
the Agreement applies to interactions on the &quot;high seas&quot;--not
in territorial waters. The broader political aspect of the Agreement
is embodied in Articles VII and IX, which provide Navy-to-Navy
channels to exchange information on incidents and establish annual
review sessions that institutionalize Navy-to-Navy contacts.
<P>
These basic technical terms of the 1972 INCSEA Agreement have
remained but have been supplemented over the ensuing two decades.
At the first annual review conference in 1973, a protocol was
added which included non-military ships of both nations (such
as merchant and fishing vessels), requiring them to be notified
of the Agreement's safety provisions and prohibiting simulated
attacks or hazardous dropping of objects near
<P>
such ships. The &quot;special signals,&quot; in addition to those
already in the International Code of Signals, were developed,
revised over time, and provided to all ships of both parties as
provided in Article VI of the basic Agreement. These signals warn
of submerged submarines, flight operations and gunnery/missile
exercises, and can signal maneuvering or other intentions. In
1987, both parties agreed to add a voice radio circuit (VHF Channel
16) as another means of communications. In 1988, dangerous use
of lasers was added as a violation of Article 111. Agreement was
never reached on fixed distance requirements, despite continued
consideration of this issue.
<P>
The broader political aspect of the Agreement has likewise stood
the test of time. Even in the early 1980's, at the height of renewed
U.S.-Soviet Cold War, the annual review meetings and Navy-to-Navy
contacts continued. Indeed, the INCSEA Agreement proved to be
remarkably resistant to the ups and downs of U.S.-Soviet political
tensions in the latter decade of the Cold War.
<P>
Figure 1. Summary of Terms of U.S.-Soviet INCSEA Agreement<HR>

<PRE>
Article I  Defines ships to mean both warships and      
           naval auxiliaries (such as intelligence      
           collection ships [AGI's], U.S. Coast Guard   
           and Soviet border guard ships), operating    
           on the high seas.                            
Article    Reaffirms governing role of International    
II         Collision Regulations (''Rules of the        
           Road''), acknowledge freedom in              
           international law to operate on high seas.   
           The Rules of the Road are not to be          
           narrowly used to dangerously disrupt ship    
           activities or formations, and ships are to   
           avoid hindering formation evolutions, and    
           stay clear of ships conducting flight or     
           underway replenishment operations.           
Article    Establishes rules to avoid dangerous         
III        maneuvers when ships of both nations are in  
           close proximity (e.g., during surveillance   
           operations), and requires use of             
           appropriate Rules of the Road and

<P>
d) Assessment of the 1972 U.S.-Soviet INCSEA Agreement
<P>
As will be seen in more detail in our analysis of recent incidents
below, the U.S.-Soviet INCSEA Agreement has been remarkably successful
in minimizing incidents between the two navies (for example, there
were no ship-to-ship incidents in 1990). This is all the more
noteworthy in view of the fact that the Soviet and U.S. Navy had
far more interactions and operations in proximity to one another
after 1972 than before. (This increased proximity was a reflection
not only of the Soviet Navy's full maturity as a globally deployed
open-ocean navy, but also a result of the increased frequency
of U.S. forward operations closer to Soviet home waters as a reflection
of the U.S. forward maritime strategy in the 1980s.) Those U.S.-Soviet
incidents at sea that did occur also appear to have caused less
diplomatic and public controversy than such incidents as the
<P>
1967 Walker collisions, since the addressal of these incidents
was automatically channeled through the established Navy-to-Navy
procedures. A variety of reasons for the general success of the
agreement have been suggested. The following characteristics of
the U.S.-Soviet INCSEA Agreement are most noteworthy for their
implications for other similar agreements:
<P>
Mutual interest in avoiding loss of life and expensive ships,
and avoiding escalation, even to hostilities, underpinned U.S.
and Soviet Navy agreement.
<P>
Specific and realistic provisions in the technical coverage of
the Agreement, made it straightforward and simple to implement
in both navies.
<P>
The professional, Navy-to-Navy character of the agreement gave
the navies of both countries a certain proprietary interest in
its success and discouraged, even at the height of the Cold War,
its political manipulation by either government as a propaganda
tool.
<P>
The bilateral nature of the agreement helped ensure confidentiality
and precluded political posturing to a multilateral audience.
<P>
Despite the overall success of the U.S.-Soviet INCSEA Agreement,
it would be unrealistic to expect that incidents had disappeared
entirely. However, as the survey of recent incidents below will
indicate, the major incidents between the U.S. and Soviet navies
since 1972 have involved areas beyond the reach of the INCSEA
Agreement-operations of submerged submarines, and operations in
territorial waters (vice the &quot;high seas&quot;). At the conclusion
of this chapter, ways of dealing with these problems will be considered.
<P>
The 1972 U.S.-Soviet INCSEA Agreement as Model: The U.S.-Soviet
Dangerous Military Activities (DMA) Agreement of 1989 and Other
INCSEA Agreements
<P>
If imitation is indeed the sincerest form of flattery, the authors
of the 1972 U.S.-Soviet INCSEA Agreement should be well pleased.
In June 1989, then-U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
Admiral Crowe and his Soviet counterpart General Moiseyev signed
an Agreement on Prevention of Dangerous Military Activities (DMA)
Patterned on the 1972 INCSEA Agreement. The DMA accord addressed
other dangerous military activities, for example intrusions into
territory or airspace (such as resulted in the 1983 shotdown by
the U.S.S.R. of the South Korean civilian airliner), dangerous
use of lasers, activities in areas of high tensions (such as the
Persian Gulf), and interference with command/communications networks.
Special communications procedures for air, land, and sea were
established. Like the INCSEA Agreement, the DMA accord provided
for incidents to be addressed by direct military contacts (at
Defense Attache level) and through an annual review meeting of
a Joint Military Commission. In summary, DMA provided a more general,
all-service agreement at the joint/general staff level.
<P>
The 1972 U.S.-Soviet INCSEA Agreement has been more directly emulated
by the ten other bilateral INCSEA Agreements reached in recent
years since the first new INCSEA accord (between the U.K. and
the U.S.S.R.) in 1986. Nine of these bilateral agreements involve
the U.S.S.R. with the following countries: U.K., Germany (1988),
Spain (1990), Norway (1990), Greece (1991), Netherlands (1991),
Japan (1993). In mid-1994 additional agreements were under negotiation
by Russia with South Korea and with Turkey. Although similar to
the U.S.-Soviet Agreement of 1972, these agreements were not carbon
copies, as reference was made to the new Law of the Sea provisions
and various other specific adjustments were made. In November
1990, the first INCSEA Agreement not involving the
<P>
U.S. and the U.S.S.R. was concluded between Germany and Poland.
This agreement may have been spurred by a 1987 incident in which
a West German naval ship observing maneuvers in the Baltic Sea
was hit by shells from a Polish naval ship.
<P>
In summary, the U.S.-Soviet INCSEA Agreement of 1972 has provided
a useful model for an all-service U.S.-U.S.S.R. agreement on Dangerous
Military Activities and for a variety of other bilateral INCSEA
Agreements. The brief general analysis which follows of global
incidents at sea since 1972, may suggest the effectiveness and
the limits of the INCSEA approach.
<H4><B>3. General Analysis of Recent Incidents at Sea</B></H4>

<P>
Before drawing conclusions on the implications of the INCSEA agreements
for security at sea in the post-Cold War environment, a brief
analysis of the major U.S.-Soviet and other, third country, incidents
at sea since 1972 is instructive. Dr. William J. Durch of the
Henry L. Stimson Center recently conducted a detailed analysis
of incidents at sea in the 1972-1989 period, which provides several
interesting insights and contains an excellent Table of selected
incidents.
<P>
a) U.S.-Soviet Incidents
<P>
In analyzing U.S.-Soviet incidents at sea over time, the number
of incidents remained low throughout the &quot;Detente&quot; era
from 1972 to 1977, increased somewhat (to a peak in the late 1970's)
as the Cold War intensified again in the 1978 to 1985 period,
then began to drop steadily from 1986 as Gorbachev came to power
and the Cold War waned. As noted earlier, it is particularly striking
that INCSEA procedures proved effective in minimizing incidents
despite the significant increase in U.S.-Soviet naval interactions
and in political tension in the early 1980s. By region, the most
U.S.-Soviet incidents have occurred in Northern European waters
(Baltic and Norwegian Seas), Atlantic Ocean, with significant
but fewer incidents centered in the Mediterranean Sea and Pacific
Ocean areas.
<P>
Several U.S.-Soviet incidents at sea since 1972 are worth noting.
First, in the October 1973 Arab-Israeli War -- when an all-time
Soviet high of nearly 100 ships operated near U.S. naval forces
in the Mediterranean -- there were various minor incidents but
overall surprisingly few serious events. This was particularly
fortunate, since any serious incidents at sea -- with both navies
present in force in an area of an ongoing conflict -- might have
quickly escalated to unintended U.S.-Soviet conflict. The next
major incidents occurred at perhaps the height of U.S.-Soviet
Cold-War hostility, following the September 1983 Soviet shotdown
of the Korean airliner in the Sea of Japan. Soviet ships reportedly
harassed U.S. naval ships conducting salvage operations in the
Sea of Japan. In November 1983, a Soviet frigate collided with
the U.S. destroyer Fife in the Arabian Sea after reportedly disrupting
carrier flight operations. In early 1984, a Soviet Victor I nuclear
attack submarine collided with the U.S. aircraft carrier Kitty
Hawk in the Sea of Japan. A week later, the Soviet carrier Minsk
fired flares at a U.S. frigate, hitting the ship and only narrowly
missing the captain. In February 1984, Soviet aircraft fired near
a U.S. destroyer in the Black Sea. Again in February 1988, during
one of the periodic U.S. exercises of the right of innocent passage
through Soviet territorial waters in the Black Sea, the U.S. destroyer
Caron and cruiser Yorktown were harassed and suffered several
collisions with Soviet ships. Several collisions between U.S.
and Soviet submarines have occurred since 1972, including several
supposedly inside Soviet-claimed territorial waters. In 1986,
a U.S. submarine was damaged when it collided in the Strait of
Gibraltar with a Soviet submarine.
<P>
The most recent incidents of the post-Cold War era have again
involved submerged submarines not covered under the 1972 INCSEA
Agreement. On February 11, 1992 a modem Sierra Class nuclear attack
submarine of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) navy
collided with the U.S. Los Angeles-class nuclear attack submarine
Baton Rouge while surfacing off the Kola Bay in the Barents Sea.
The U.S. submarine was at periscope depth, probably monitoring
naval activities out of this Soviet naval base. The Russians protested
that the U.S. submarine was in Russian territorial waters, but
U.S. leaders rejected this, noting that the U.S. and Russia disagree
on territorial waters limits (Russia claims an area within a straight
baseline drawn across the Kola Bay, beyond the 12-mile limit observed
by the U.S.). (A subsequent statement by a Russian Northern Fleet
spokesman claimed that such submarine collisions &quot;had been
an almost annual occurrence b etween 1967 and 1986, but that this
was the first registered case since then&quot;). The U.S. Secretary
of State, Baker, broke with the past silences on both sides and
informed the Russian President Boris Yeltsin, in Moscow, that
a U.S. submarine was involved. More recently, on March 26, 1992
the Commonwealth of Independent States Navy claimed to have chased
a foreign submarine from her territorial waters off the strategic
Barents Sea port of Murmansk. Most recently, another minor US-Russian
submarine collision occurred in March 1993.
<P>
As Dr. Durch's analysis indicated, submarines have also been involved
in many incidents with fishing trawlers and their nets, often
in the local waters adjacent to the submarines' home country ports.
The U.K. Royal Navy recently announced a thirty-percent cut in
submarine operations in its Clyde area, and a compulsory two-mile
distance between fishing boats and submarines, after four deaths
in the accidental sinking of a fishing boat in November 1990.
<P>
b) Other Significant Naval Incidents
<P>
The most notable non-U.S.-Soviet incidents at sea over the past
twenty years have involved various global disputes over territorial
waters, and incidents in the Persian Gulf area during the 1980-1988
Iran-Iraq War.
<P>
Disputes over territorial waters have occurred between a variety
of nations around the globe. Perhaps the longest series of hostile
incidents has occurred between the U.S. and Libya over the Gulf
of Sidra area. Libya's Colonel Qaddafi has claimed a vast area
in the Southern Mediterranean, the Gulf of Sidra, as Libyan territorial
waters, while the U.S., in defense of freedom of the seas, has
challenged those claims to avoid their recognition by acquiescence
and the setting of an unfavorable precedent. As early as March
1973, and again in September 1980, Libyan fighters shot at (but
missed) a U.S. reconnaissance aircraft in this area. In August
1981, U.S. Navy fighters shot down two Libyan fighters which appeared
to be attacking them. In March 1986, U.S. naval forces conducting
&quot;freedom of navigation&quot; operations in the Gulf of Sidra
sank two challenging Libyan patrol boats. Again in January 1989,
U.S. Navy aircraft shot down two Libyan fighters. Elsewhere, we
have already noted how Greek-Turkish disputes over territorial
waters and airspace brought both countries to the brink of war
due to incidents surrounding the activities of a Turkish oil exploration
ship in March 1987. In the South China Sea, territorial disputes
exist between many nations over the Spratlies and Paracels Islands
groups, which led to hostilities between the navies of Vietnam
and the P.R.C. in March 1988. Attacks on, and seizure of, South
Korean and Japanese fishing boats by North Korea have been recurrent
incidents creating tension in Northeast Asia, as have Soviet seizures
of Japanese fishing boats near the disputed &quot;Northern Territories&quot;
islands north of Hokkaido. Indeed, fishing boat seizures, in the
new Exclusive Economic Zones as well as in territorial waters,
have been common global occurrences even between such close allies
as the U.S. and Canada (indeed, fishing rights disputes led to
a series of dangerous collisions of U.K. naval ships and Icelandic
fishing boats during their &quot;Cod War&quot; of the mid-1970s).
<P>
In addition to these disputes over the extent (and exploitation
of) territorial and adjacent waters, the other common category
of recent major incidents has involved the presence of neutral
naval forces in the waters of the Persian Gulf during the 1980-1988
Iran-Iraq War. In May 1987, two Iraqi aircraft-launched Exocet
missiles struck, and nearly sank, the U.S. frigate Stark in the
Persian Gulf. Later that summer, the U.S. seized an Iranian vessel
laying mines in the Gulf. In April 1988, after an Iranian mine
severely damaged a U.S. frigate in the international waters of
the Gulf, U.S. Navy ships and aircraft destroyed two Iranian oil
platforms and sunk or damaged six Iranian naval vessels. In early
July 1988, the U.S. Aegis cruiser Vincennes shot down by error
an Iranian Airbus civilian airliner crossing the Persian Gulf.
As was the case in the North Atlantic during the early World War
I and War II periods, the actions of the combatants in the Persian
Gulf during the Iran-Iraq war tended to lead to hostile incidents
which affected neutral naval forces--not to mention the extensive
damage to neutral merchant shipping.
<P>
In summary, since 1972 the U.S.-Soviet INCSEA Agreement seems
to have been successful in minimizing incidents between the two
navies. Perhaps the most serious recent incidents have involved
two areas which were intentionally not covered by the INCSEA Agreements--disputes
over territorial water boundaries and operations of submerged
submarines. Other major incidents since 1972 have centered also
on disputes over territorial water (and airspace) boundaries,
notably between the U.S. and Libya, but also between other neighboring
countries in the Aegean Sea, the South China Sea, East China Sea,
and Sea of Japan areas. Finally, maritime areas surrounding ongoing
wars (such as the Persian Gulf) remain a source of hostile incidents
with neutral shipping and navies.
<H4><B>4. Conclusions: Minimizing Incidents at Sea in the Post-Cold
War World</B></H4>

<P>
With the end of the Cold War (and even of the Soviet Union), it
is appropriate to consider the broader implications of the 1972
INCSEA Agreement for minimizing incidents at sea in the post-Cold
War world. The 1972 U.S.-Soviet INCSEA Agreement has been successful
in both technical terms--reducing the frequency and severity of
incidents--and political terms--in establishing regular professional
Navy-to-Navy meetings which served broader confidence-building
and tension reduction goals.
<P>
Our earlier analysis makes clear that the INCSEA Agreement was
not designed, however, to deal with two other sources of incidents
at sea--disputed boundaries of territorial waters and airspace,
and the operations of submerged submarines. Our analysis has also
indicated that incidents at sea on a global (not just U.S.-Soviet)
basis frequently arise from two major sources: disputes over the
boundaries of territorial (and Exclusive Economic Zones) waters
and airspace, and attacks on neutral shipping and navies in maritime
areas adjacent to an ongoing conflict (such as the Persian Gulf
during the Iran-Iraq conflict in the 1980s). Our conclusions below
will consider potential ways to minimize the incidents resulting
from these circumstances.
<P>
Recent positive developments in bilateral actions to deal with
the &quot;gaps&quot;-territorial waters disputes and submerged
submarine operations--in the 1972 INCSEA Agreement, may provide
some positive lessons for other nations in the international community
dealing with similar problems.
<P>
Since 1986, the U.S. and the Soviet Union have engaged in a series
of bilateral law of the sea negotiations, conducted by diplomats,
with the participation of naval officers. The 1988 incidents,
where U.S. naval ships Caron and Yorktown had minor collisions
with Soviet ships protesting their &quot;innocent passage through
Black Sea territorial waters&quot;, provided a final spur for
both countries to act to end years of incidents in this Black
Sea region. The law of the Sea discussions resulted in a Joint
Statement in September 1989 by Secretary of State Baker and Foreign
Minister Shevardnadze, in which the U.S.S.R. joined the U.S. in
acknowledging the right of warships to transit the territorial
sea in innocent passage, and the U.S. acknowledged that &quot;innocent
passage&quot; challenges in this Black Sea area would no longer
be necessary. Bilateral law of the sea negotiations are continuing,
with a focus on resolving disputes over the boundaries of territorial
waters, straight baselines or historic bay claims in areas such
as Kola Bay in the Barents Sea and Peter the Great Bay in the
Sea of Japan. The recent February 1992 U.S.-Russian disputes over
the location, relative to territorial waters, of the U.S. submarine
that collided with the C.I.S. submarine in Kola Bay indicates
the importance of ongoing bilateral negotiations between nations
having disputes over territorial waters boundaries to resolve
these disputes. Keeping such negotiations separate from any agreements
on incidents at sea seems to be an appropriate course of action,
as disputes over boundaries of territorial seas and airspace and
Exclusive Economic Zones involve interpretations of the law of
the sea best addressed in an international legal context through
diplomatic channels, rather than by the Navy-to-Navy military
channels of INCSEA Agreements. The implications for similar disputes
in the global context-- Greek-Turkish disputes in the Aegean,
India-Pakistan disputes, conflicting claims of multiple nations
in the Spratlies and Paracels Islands of the South China Sea,
and North and South Korean disputes--is that the international
community should strongly encourage bilateral and, where necessary
(e.g., South China Sea) multilateral law of the sea negotiations
to resolve these disputes that are perhaps the most frequent cause
of incidents, and more often involve fishing boats rather than
naval ships. Pending the slow resolution of such disputes, disputing
nations might do well to adopt provisions similar to those in
Articles II and III of the U.S.-Soviet Dangerous Military Activities
agreement of 1989, designed to avoid incursions (and to communicate,
if they cannot be avoided) into the territory of other nations.
<P>
Solving the problem of the involvement of submarines in incidents
at sea is more difficult. The inherent stealthy nature of submerged
submarines in the &quot;silent service&quot; of all nations precludes
the various visual communications possible under the INCSEA Agreement.
Although underwater communications on sonar are possible, such
actions reveal the locations of transmitting submarines. The governments
of the U.S. and its major submarine-capable Allies have long rejected--as
a violation of the concept of freedom of the seas, and as a negation
of the unique value of the submarine--another radical solution
formerly trumpeted by the U.S.S.R. and some Western arms controllers,
of establishing &quot;keep out&quot; areas in international waters
which submarines would pledge to avoid. Indeed, even the Soviet
Navy, with the largest submarine force in the world, readily agreed
with the U.S. Navy to exclude these stealthy vessels (except when
on the surface like another ship) from the provisions of the 1972
INCSEA Agreement.
<P>
Despite the recent February 1992 and March 1993 reminders that
submarines may be a source of incidents at sea even in the post-Cold
War world, resolution of this problem is not simple. &quot;Keep
out&quot; areas will continue to be rejected by the U.S. and many
other nations as a violation of the basic principle of freedom
of the seas. Another way of avoiding potential submarine collisions
is &quot;waterspace management,&quot; where separate areas for
different nations' submarine operations are established, and 'Submarine
Notes' on area submarine presence are exchanged. In the past,
such procedures have been limited to close NATO Allies. At a time
now when U.S. forces are preparing joint military exercises with
Russian and other former Warsaw Pact opponents it is conceivable
that cooperative submarine procedures could be considered. But
the new security environment has not quite progressed that far
yet, and may not do so as long as the monitoring of deploying
ballistic missile submarines by the &quot;national technical means&quot;
of a covert, forward-deployed submarine is still deemed necessary.
<P>
This leaves three possible near-term courses to minimize (primarily
US-Soviet, but potentially other nations' submarine incidents).
First, nations should be governed by a &quot;general prudential
rule&quot; regarding submerged submarine operations in territorial
waters whose precise boundaries are disputed (such as the Kola
Bay). While separate diplomatic bilateral law of the sea negotiations
proceed to reach agreement on disputed boundaries, and given the
overall post-Cold War improvement in relations, it might be wise
to maintain monitoring submarine operations outside the disputed
area of territorial waters. Should a collision occur, the recent
notification of the other nation involved by Secretary Cheney
should set a precedent for notification of involvement. Second,
an even more ambitious near-term step might be to agree, in the
INCSEA Agreement context, to require submarines to avoid simulated
attacks on ships or submarines of the other party and to require
transmission on sonar when a dangerous underwater situation of
close proximity is discovered. Rear Admiral Hill, in making similar
suggestions earlier, noted that &quot;the intelligence penalties
could be considerable&quot; but also questioned whether 'the risks
are worth it' in continuing traditional covert submarine practices
in dangerous situations. Third, to avoid the frequent problems
of incidents in which submarines damage fishing trawlers in coastal
areas, nations should ensure their submarines minimize submerged
operations in their coastal fishing areas.
<P>
Having addressed these problems of the existing prototype 1972
US-Soviet INCSEA Agreement, it is appropriate to consider the
continuing relevance of similar INCSEA Agreements to the post-Cold
War world. Three possibilities, not necessarily exclusive, exist
for using the 1972 INCSEA Agreement as a model to reduce future
incidents at sea.
<P>
First, there are other nations which should consider appropriate
bilateral INCSEA agreements modelled on the US-Soviet agreement.
Despite the list of recent bilateral INCSEA agreements between
NATO nations and the USSR noted earlier, there remain numerous
nations around the globe whose relations are unfriendly and whose
opportunities for interaction and incidents at sea are frequent.
Potential candidates include: Greece-Turkey, Israel-Syria, Iran-Iraq,
India-Pakistan, numerous nations bordering the South China Sea
(including the PRC), PRC-Russia, Japan-PRC, Japan-Russia, and
North and South Korea. Where appropriate, such INCSEA agreements
should be paralleled by diplomatic-legal negotiations to resolve
law of the sea disputes over territorial and Exclusive Economic
Zone boundaries. Additionally, given the fact that incidents of
many smaller nations frequently involve fishing vessels vice naval
ships, provisions (similar to those in the US-Soviet DMA Agreement)
to minimize hostile incidents from intrusions in territorial waters
might be included in any INCSEA agreement, and made applicable
to fishing and merchant vessels.
<P>
The second possibility is to use the proven US-Soviet bilateral
INCSEA Agreement as a model for appropriate regional agreements.
To avoid a messy proliferation of bilateral agreements among the
new post-Soviet nations and others in the Baltic Sea and Black
Sea, for example, a multilateral INCSEA agreement might be useful.
Other areas where proximity and shared interests in avoiding incidents
among a variety of nations might be useful include the South China
Sea and the Sea of Japan area. Unlike the US-Soviet INCSEA Agreement,
agreements in the regions that are relevant would likely have
to address incidents in territorial waters (as well as the &quot;high
seas&quot;), and include merchant and fishing vessels as well
as naval ships and auxiliaries. In short, these agreements would
be more in the nature of broad regional &quot;Maritime Safety
and Confidence-Building&quot; accords than a narrowly focused
accord on naval incidents. The broader regional nature of such
agreements may make them more difficult to negotiate, and will
in all cases raise difficult questions about the geographic scope
of the agreement, as well as the impact on (and involvement of)
extra-regional naval and other ships. Nonetheless, the concept
of regional &quot;maritime safety&quot; agreements may well be
appropriate for at least the specific areas identified above.
<P>
The third possibility for building on the 1972 US-Soviet INCSEA
Agreement is the suggestion in the 1985 UN Report on the naval
arms race that &quot;consideration should be given to making multilateral
the existing bilateral agreement between the Soviet Union and
the United States.&quot; The Swedish Delegation to the United
Nations later circulated a draft multinational treaty on incidents
at sea, and the Disarmament Advisor to the Swedish Minister of
Defense has written in support of such a multilateral regime.
Establishing as international norms the INCSEA technical provisions
for naval forces on the high seas to avoid dangerous maneuvers,
restricting harassment, and establishing communications would
probably help to avoid some incidents. However, the political
aspects and benefits of the bilateral US-Soviet INCSEA Agreement--the
vested interest of two large navies frequently interacting on
the high seas, and the regular professional and confidential Navy-to-Navy
contacts--would not be so apparent in a multilateral agreement.
Many countries with very small, coastal navies would be minimally
involved, and if regular review of implementation were done in
a multilateral context, the temptation to &quot;play to the audience&quot;
might increase and result in public polemics. These potential
drawbacks of a multilateral INCSEA Agreement have led the United
States to oppose such an agreement. The Soviet Union, on the other
hand, in June 1990 tabled a proposal at the Vienna CSCE negotiations
for a multilateral INCSEA Agreement among CSCE members. In the
post-Cold War environment, it is possible that a multilateral
proposal to deal with naval incidents on the high seas might be
re-evaluated as a narrow supplement to existing bilateral INCSEA
agreements dealing with naval forces on the high seas. This approach
would retain and broaden the technical benefits of the INCSEA
measures to discourage dangerous maneuvers and harassment and
encourage communications, while retaining the political benefits
of confidential Navy-to-Navy discussions under existing bilateral
INCSEA agreements (or, on request, between two parties to the
multilateral agreement).
<P>
A final source of incidents at sea has been attacks on neutral
naval and merchant ships in waters adjacent to an ongoing conflict,
such as the Persian Gulf during the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq War. Although
existing laws of war address many of these situations, the US
and the USSR, as a result of the close operations of their forces
in the dangerous Persian Gulf area, agreed to a provision in the
1989 Dangerous Military Activities Agreement for designating a
region as a &quot;Special Caution Area&quot; where special communications
would be maintained to avoid potential incidents (such as an attack
by a third party resulting in bilateral incidents). Although the
increased danger to naval and air forces in a zone of conflict
is a natural problem, nations might consider including in any
bilateral, regional, or multilateral INCSEA agreements a provision
on special &quot;caution area&quot; designation and special communications
similar to that in the recent US-Soviet DMA Agreement.
<P>
In conclusion, the experience of the 1972 US-Soviet Incidents
at Sea Agreement (and the 1989 US-Soviet Dangerous Military Activities
Agreement) suggests several supplementary approaches to minimize
incidents at sea in the post-Cold War world. The existing and
additional bilateral agreements still provide a sound technical
and political basis to reduce special bilateral incidents at sea.
There may be benefit in certain specific regions to a regional
&quot;Safety at Sea&quot; approach which broadens these provisions
through a regional agreement addressing also non-naval (fishing
and merchant) shipping and including regional territorial waters
(as well as the high seas). Additionally, the time-tested provisions
of the US-Soviet bilateral INCSEA Agreement requiring naval forces
on the high seas to communicate and avoid dangerous maneuvers
and harassment might be incorporated into a multilateral agreement
open to all nations. It is significant to note that these bilateral,
regional, and multilateral approaches are not necessarily mutually
exclusive. Nor can they deal with the problems of inherently covert
submerged submarines, law of the sea disputes over boundaries
of territorial seas (and Exclusive Economic Zones), and the danger
of incidents in waters adjacent to an ongoing conflict. A flexible
variety of bilateral and multilateral actions is needed to minimize
these latter more difficult causes of incidents at sea. These
include continuing appropriate bilateral and multilateral negotiations
on agreed interpretations of law of the sea boundaries, prudent
caution in forward submerged submarine operations near disputed
boundaries (and perhaps provisions for submarine underwater communications
in extreme situations of perceived close danger), and agreements
for special designation and appropriate communication of ships
and aircraft in dangerous zones of ongoing conflicts. A proper
complementary mix, of these suggested actions can help further
reduce global incidents at sea in the post-Cold War world.

<H2><B>NON-MILITARY COOPERATION IN THE MEDITERRANEAN AND NORTH
AFRICA</B> </H2>

<P>
<B>Professor Salvino BUSUTTIL</B>
<P>
Director-General, Foundation for International Studies
<P>
University of Malta<HR>

<P>
The forms of non-military cooperation in the Mediterranean and
North Africa on which I shall concentrate are basically classical
and conventional, that is they are essentially based on somebody
from the North contributing something to the South. The main area
of concentration concerns the environment especially the marine
environment. In this context, the principal success lies with
the Mediterranean Action Plan which, launched in 1975, was subsequently
given its institutional frame-work through the Barcelona Convention
to which all Mediterranean States plus the European Union are
signatory. That Convention, on the protection and conservation
of the Mediterranean Sea against pollution has had a chequered
history. It operates through five regional centres broadly corresponding
to the Protocols which now enrich the Convention.
<P>
Following the Nicosia Charter in 1990 and the Cairo Declaration
of 1992, the contracting parties to the Convention agreed on the
initiative of the European Union, that it was important Sustainable
Development be pursued, so that environmental and developmental
concerns be brought together. However, apart from official declarations,
there is very little to show so far for this move.
<P>
A further area of co-operation is in fisheries, especially through
FAO's General Fisheries Council of the Mediterranean; and, in
agriculture, through ICAMAS, the International Centre for Advanced
Studies in Mediterranean Agronomy which, inter alia, also promotes
Aquaculture. There is, of course, also Euromar, to the extent
practicable under the Eureka Projects which however is limited
to a few Mediterranean countries which have been able so far to
participate. The latter project, in particular, is considered
to be a model for the creation on a joint basis of research and
development between the North and the South and should be extended
to provide technological co-operation in a number of areas.
<P>
In so far as University co-operation is concerned, Med Campus
and the Community of Mediterranean Universities as well as, lately,
the University of the Mediterranean (UNIMED), foster networks
of co-operation between major universities. However, there is
still a considerable potential to be fulfilled. I think that the
first necessity is technological co-operation especially through
the identification of regional needs to which regional technological
solutions should be found.
<P>
I referred earlier to Eureka as providing a possible model for
this co-operation. It would seem to me, for example, that solar
desalination could be a good candidate for a focus of co-operation
using those sources (i.e. the sea and the sun) which are plentiful
and would of course contribute in an important manner to the solution
of one of the major problems in the Mediterranean, North Africa
and the Middle East: the supply and distribution of water.
<P>
Again, in the sphere of fisheries co-operation so far is very
limited. There are no regional or even bilateral fisheries. Sea
routes are non- existent in the sense that there are no agreed
routes in the Mediterranean. Similarly, for emergencies at sea,
especially for major catastrophies there is no stock-piling of
equipment; and the southern countries, in particular, would in
an emergency, still have to rely on assistance from countries
such as France and Italy and, to a lesser extent, Spain and Greece.
<P>
Moreover, the countries of the South also need important and urgent
assistance for the disposal of liquid and solid wastes, and for
the transport of toxic material which unfortunately, still finds
its way from the North to the South. There should also be a more
responsible attitude towards tourism which, in the manner it is
now being conducted, adds a source of upheaval in the Southern
countries, particularly through the modes and styles of life which
it suggests; and which, for economic as well as cultural and religious
reasons, the South finds it difficult to follow even as its younger
generations seem to want to ape it.
<P>
Increasingly, I find that in the Mediterranean it is important
that an act of courage be taken towards institutional advancement
i.e. to have a mechanism, however simple and however inexpensive,
to bring together the countries of the Mediterranean. Interesting
concepts have been mooted such as the Council of the Mediterranean,
a Mediterranean Agency or a Mediterranean Authority. It would
seem to me that the creation of a Mediterranean Commission for
Sustainable Development, bringing together environmental and development
concerns, could be a major step in this direction. Such a commission
could be created by a protocol to the existing Barcelona Convention
and could, at least during an initial period, be linked to the
administrative and institutional arrangements of the Mediterranean
Action Plan.
<P>
At the same time, the Mediterranean Forum held in Alexandria last
July has now raised the possibility of greater co-operation in
economic, political and cultural affairs. Indeed, the next meeting
is being held in Portugal proceeded by gatherings on economic,
political and cultural issues. It may well lay the ground for
the creation of such a commission as I have just referred to.
Ultimately, however, it is in technological advancement that the
real solutions to regional ills can be found.
<P>
Co-operation between government and universities as well as with
industry, especially in research and development, is essential.
Of course, for the South this may not be an easy matter because
few Southern countries have a tradition of this type of co-operation.
But in a situation where the ratio of GNP devoted to research
funds is now in the ratio of about 3/40 : 1 between North and
South, the need for technological advancement in order to motor
economic growth and development is imperative.
<P>
In this context, Confidence Building Measures (CBMS) are of course
important. But they should not lead to one-way traffic i.e. CBMs
coming from the North to the South. Since they are Confidence
Building Measures, they must be authentic, and they must arise
as much from the South as from the North. Secondly they must not
be so projected as to convey the impression of an &quot;imposition&quot;
of values. Let us not forget that values constitute a very basic
problem and are rooted in ethnic, religious and cultural traditions,
which through their differences, contribute to instability and
insecurity in the Mediterranean.
<P>
Neither must we continue to promote a transfer of technology based
on an import/export mentality from the North vis-&agrave;-vis
the South, respectively, especially where the technology exported
is obsolescent and environmentally &quot;poor&quot;.
<P>
CBM's should be genuinely inspired. They should also involve non-governmental
organisations. After all, it is not only and perhaps not even
primarily Governments, that introduce and instill Confidence Building
Measures. Confidence is a human resource and therefore cannot
be imposed by governments.
<P>
Some conclusions:
<P>
It is evident that Mediterranean countries need to pool their
resources. In this context, the above-mentioned proposal for a
Mediterranean Commission for Sustainable Development might provide
the framework necessary. Confidence Building Measures must be
seen as responding to regional needs or through the needs of a
particular area of the region and must be so conceived, so promoted
and so implemented as to show objectively and without any ambivalence
that they are meant to raise the standard of living of the peoples
of the Mediterranean, of North Africa and the Middle East, in
a setting of durable peace and lasting security, a security which
is not so much military as much as a guarantee against poverty,
injustice and equality.

<H2><B>REMOTE SENSING : THE TOOL OF INTEGRATED COASTAL ZONE MANAGEMENT
</B></H2>

<H2><B>Towards Peace in the Mediterranean</B></H2>

Abstract
<P>
Remote Sensing, GIS and mathematical modelling are emerging as
the new enabling technologies that could be utilised for continuous
environmental sustainability. Such tools together with an integrated
resource management approach developed on a national and regional
scale, and the establishment of a regional data communications
infrastructure will facilitate peaceful regional co-operation
in the long term.
<P>
Space technology in the Mediterranean is still associated with
spy satellities and is not seen as a potential environmentally
friendly technology. Regional iniativites like for example oil
spill monitoring, which is a simple excercise to carry out with
remote sensing have still not happened, in spite of the legal
frameworks already established under the UN Environmental Programme
(UNEP) and the Mediterranean Action Plan (MAP).
<P>
The task to shift the paradigm from a security equals military
balance approach to a security equals peaceful cooperation is
indeed a very daunting one.
<P>
In this paper an attempt is made to present a vision of the Mediterranean,
whereby a regional data communications infrastructure will facilitate
the implementation of an integrated management approach, which
will, in turn, enable a fast and sound decision making. In this
scenario a new and creative business culture will grow and flourish
which will propel the Mediterranean region towards a new type
of prosperity and long-lasting peace.
<H4><B>1. Geographical Characteristics of the Mediterranean</B>
</H4>

<P>
The Mediterranean is described by a particular type of climate,
as well as a complex geology which determine the coastal landscape
characteristics. The Mediterranean coastline itself defines a
virtually enclosed sea, highly saline because of heavy evaporation
which is not balanced by inputs from rain and rivers. An inflow
which passes through the Straits of Gibraltar from the Atlantic
maintains the sea-level. The Mediterranean waters are comparatively
warm and governed by surface currents which change during the
year. The complexity of these currents reflects that of the sea's
structure. In addition, the Mediterranean tides are weak, an extremely
significant feature which facilitates shipping, but at the same
time is detrimental to the problems of pollution along the coast.
<P>
The Mediterranean basin lies at the centre of a very intricate
patchwork formed by tectonic plates of the earth's crust sliding
under one another. This gives rise to strong seismic and volcanic
activity, which many times leads to tragic human upheavals.
<P>
The four major river deltas (Rhone, Ebro, Po and the Nile) are
considered as unstable areas, in the sense that they are very
sensitive to variations in the sea level, with rapidly alternating
periods of erosion and sedimentation, reflected by advancing or
retreating shore-lines.
<P>
The sea-level changes experienced in the Mediterranean also aggravate
the fresh water situation, a scarce resource in most parts of
the region, as saltwater intrusion &quot;pollutes&quot; the aquifers.
<P>
Against this background of a highly fragile physical environment
the Mediterranean countries are facing similar rapid resource
depletion and environmental deterioration due to demographic,
social, cultural, political and economic pressuresThese environmental
scenarios require therefore to be studied in their complexity,
using a holistic approach and within a global framework. To reach
this goal, a regional strategy needs to be devised that could
be acceptable to all countries of the Mediterranean. To reach
this goal, a regional strategy acceptable to all Mediterranean
countries needs to be devised.
<H4><B>2. The Regional Strategy</B></H4>

<P>
The strategy which should be aimed at political, scientific and
business levels should facilitate the introduction and implementation
of an Integrated Resource Management approach at the local, national
and regional level.
<P>
Primarily, the strategy has to define what constitutes an integrated
approach, secondly, what will be the objectives of such an approach
and thirdly, what are the tools to achieve effective results.
<P>
The fundamental approach of Integrated Resource Management is
based on the premise of shared information, that is, an easy flow
of data from one sector to another. The revolutionary aspect of
this approach will be that information passes not only vertically,
i.e. it follows not only the usual hierarchical organizational
structure, but information flows also occur laterally, that is,
from one sector to another. The latter flow is then not necessarily
restricted towards the top of the sector, as it may indeed occur
predominantly at the level where the actual data is required.
The basic idea of IRM is based on open networks, the size and
the number of the points in the network depending on the task
in hand.
<P>
The short-term and long-term benefits of Integrated Resource Management
will be in having all the necessary data available whenever a
need presents itself, thus enabling both prompt and sound decision-making.
<P>
The tools required for IRM are clear: a data communications technology
infrastructure on a regional scale which would also allow for
real-time transmission from satellites and their data input to
strategic GIS nodes. These GIS data centres will collect, store
and have the facilities to utilize instantly information on the
environment, especially on coastal and marine resources as diverse
as water quality, fish stock movement, coastal urbanization impacts,
sea level fluctuations, coastal dynamics and so on.
<P>
Through the use of GIS and mathematical modelling capabilities
it will become possible to establish the carrying capacity of
any coastal resource; as well as to detect and contain natural
and manmade hazards, such as coastal erosion, effluent overflows,
oil spills, etc.
<P>
It is clear that the combined use of remote sensing, GIS and a
modern data communication infrastructure presents a necessary
condition to carry out resource management and coastal zone management
on a national and regional scale. However, for such management
to be effective it will be furthermore required that the above
tools are utilized and understood in a wider political, cultural
and economic context.
<H4><B>3. The Mediterranean Action Plan (MAP)</B></H4>

<P>
The presently existing regional diplomatic infrastructure is offered
through the Mediterranean Action Plan of the United Nations Environment
Programme (UNEP/MAP).
<P>
UNEP/MAP was set up in 1975 by the signatories to the Barcelona
Convention. It operates on a relatively small budget and is currently
concerned mainly with monitoring the Mediterranean environment
through MEDPOL. MEDPOL, with the assistance of about 200 scientific
groups from 83 institutions in 16 countries, gathers data on the
state and trends of pollution in the Mediterranean and carries
out research projects.
<P>
MAP marked the start of an international cooperation to clean
up the Mediterranean Sea. The Barcelona Convention has so far
provided the essential framework for common action and regional
decision-making.
<P>
Another element of MAP, the Blue Plan, looks ahead to the first
25 years of the next century and predicts dramatic demographic
change. According to its findings, the south, which had 32 % of
the Mediterranean countries' population in 1950, will account
for about 60 % in 2025. An estimated 400% increase in population
is predicted over these 75 years. As well as an increased resident
population, the region could experience the arrival of 158 million
tourists by 2000 and 260 million by 2025.
<P>
A newly established Regional Activity Centre(RAC) of MAP deals
with Environmental Remote Sensing(ERS). RAC/ERS is stationed in
Scanzano, Sicily. Amongst its recommendations it mentions the
monitoring of oil spills in the region, with the use of repetitive
satellite coverage. If the financial means and the political will
are found to achieve this particular aim, each coastal state would
benefit from such an early-warning system which could detect oil
spills before reaching the respective coasts and hence prevent
their contamination. Such a remote sensing operation should be
the first exercise of a regional integrated coastal zone management
infrastructure.
<H4><B>4. Some perspectives on integrated coastal zone management
</B> </H4>

<P>
More than 35% of the international trade in crude and refined
petroleum products is crossing the Mediterranean Sea, which is
very vulnerable to pollution, both from the ships carrying such
products as from coastal refineries and loading and unloading
terminals.
<P>
The most recent large-scale tanker disaster in Mediterranean waters
was the Haven explosion on 11 April 1991, when a Cypriot tanker
caught fire and exploded while at anchor, seven miles off Genoa
in Italy. The tanker, which carried 144,000 tonnes of crude oil
at the time, broke into three parts and it is estimated that more
than 10,000 tonnes of fresh and partially burnt oil were spilled
into the sea before the ship sank. Collection of the burnt residue,
which was highly viscous at ambient temperatures, proved very
difficult. The Italian authorities concentrated on deploying booms
to protect beaches but gale force winds soon carried both oil
and booms ashore.
<P>
Within the week following the incident, floating oil affected
beaches to the west of Genoa and strong winds buried oil in sand.
Some oil spread as far as the Hyeres near Toulon in France. The
coast of Monaco was also affected. It took ten days before divers
were able to stop the main leakage from the wreck.
<P>
In the same month about 140 people were killed when the ferry
Moby Prince collided in thick fog with an oil tanker moored in
the Italian port of Livorno.
<P>
The Paris-based Economic and Maritime Research Agency (Economar),
has shown concern that the multiplication of very fast passenger
ships on routes which are plied by large carriers, could result
in the repetition of similar or even worse accidents, and has
suggested that the Mediterranean should impose a system of compulsory
navigation control similar to that existing for aviation.
<P>
A radar system operating from a shore-based control and a monitoring
station would track ships' movements and make radio contact with
their masters to determine the identity of the ships and their
destinations. The shore station staff would then be able to advise
the ships on route-finding to help avert any potential collisions.
However, this plan, which has the support of the United Nations
Environment Programme's Mediterranean office, is being strongly
resisted by tanker owners.
<P>
While major incidents draw attention to the Mediterranean's problems,
the insistent background pollution must be considered equally
serious. Every year about 650,000 tonnes of hydrocarbons are released
in the Sea mostly through deliberate discharge of bilge and ballast
water from ships. New industries and industrial processes mean
that the cargoes are increasingly hazardous. Petroleum products
are not the only problem. Increased sea transport of industrial
chemicals, often carried on roll-on ferries, brings a growing
danger of accidental spills of toxic material.
<P>
The above mentioned cases are just a few examples of not necessarily
connected events and scenarios that could be monitored effectively
if a regional technological infrastructure can be put in place.
<H4><B>5. A Mediterranean Communication Technology Infrastructure
</B> </H4>

<P>
The establishing of a Mediterranean communication technology infrastructure
is a momentous task which cannot be achieved in isolation. The
European Union has already initiated and developed programmes
and projects in the last decade, which if extended to the Mediterranean
region could prove of mutual benefit. The present policy of the
EU for the Mediterranean encompasses programmes that deal with
Euro/Med partnerships such as Avicenne; Life; MedCampus; MedInvest;
MedSpa etc. Such programmes are meant to develop human networks
which would lead to other cooperative projects in the future.
These networks would be enhanced if supported by a regional data
communications infrastructure.
<P>
Moreover, it should also be realized that if the Mediterranean
is kept out of the communication technologies evolving in Europe,
it would create a future imbalance of development and standardization.
<H4><B>6. Telecommunications policy of the European Union</B>
</H4>

<P>
The Maastricht Treaty calls for the establishment of Trans-European
Networks which implies the preparation of guidelines for the introduction
of Broadband Networks in the Community. The Treaty foresees actions
favouring the interconnection and interoperation of the national
networks and the access to these networks, taking into account
the necessity to link the peripheral regions, that is the EFTA
countries, and in the more distant future, the Central and Eastern
European countries, with the central regions of the Community.
It does not consider the Mediterranean region.
<P>
Indeed, a far-sighted approach that should be the immediate concern
of the Mediterranean countries is to already adopt and adapt measures
to ensure the interoperability of data communications networks
and applications. Such a conformity in the overall technological
infrastructure will enable North South and East West communication
and will facilitate the integrated coastal zone management possibilities
in the Mediterranean.
<P>
The measures to be taken to ensure the interoperability of data
communications networks and applications are fourfold: they concern
the needs for common architectures, standardization, information
and training, and provision of data communications bearer services.
<H4><B>7. Architectures</B></H4>

<P>
One of the main difficulties in setting up networks between administrations
is the diversity and incompatibility of the national systems,
each of which has been developed separately but which must now
be interconnected and made interoperable. The definition and introduction
of jointly devised architectures is one way of solving the problem
while at the same time cutting down investment and operating costs.
<P>
The main purpose of a common data communications architecture
for networks between administrations will, therefore, be to create
and optimize the conditions under which the administrations independent
information systems are to intercommunicate over the telecommunications
networks.
<H4><B>8. Standardization</B></H4>

<P>
Since the major objective in the implementation of efficient data
communications networks is interoperability between the various
parts of a particular network and between different networks,
the use of common message formatting and communication standards
is a condition of success.
<H4><B>9. Information and training</B></H4>

<P>
In addition to all these activities, awareness campaigns will
aim to inform and train administrations directly and indirectly
concerned by the issues of trans Mediterranean and international
data communications networks, and to facilitate coordination and
monitoring between administrations at national and regional levels.
<H4><B>10. Bearer services</B></H4>

<P>
Finally, analysis of users' needs in the various areas of administration
involved in data interchange shows that three types of bearer
service will generally be required: electronic mail, file transfer
and access to databases for interrogation or updating.
<H4><B>11. The Potentially Leading Organisation in the Mediterranean:
CEDARE</B></H4>

<P>
The &quot;Centre for Environment and Development for the Arab
Region and Europe&quot; (CEDARE); may well prove to be the organization
to take on the task of leading the region to develop a data communications
infrastructure and to advocate a regional integrated coastal zone
management. At its first focal point meeting which took place
in Cairo in June 1993, a general consensus showed that CEDARE
should play an active role in creating a regional network enabling
multi-lateral cooperation. At an earlier meeting of its Technical
Advisory Committee, members recommended that CEDARE could be instrumental
in the collection, assessment and dissemination of information,
as well as the vehicle for introduction of new ideas, methodologies
and technologies in the region. More recently, CEDARE also decided
to set up an Information Service Unit (ISU), based on a modular
style, which could mean the start of a much larger information
network.
<H4><B>12. The Middle East Peace Accord</B></H4>

<P>
Last year's historic peace accord in the Middle East may well
prove to be the gateway to a new type of cooperation in the region.
It should give rise to new opportunities for economic growth which
will lead to prosperity on the one hand, but could contribute
further to the region's environmental degradation on the other.
However, with the right communication infrastructure and the right
management approaches, local and foreign businesses will be able
to grow and flourish. Set in an integrated management atmosphere,
a different economic culture may develop. These companies will
come to deal with environmental issues as matters of a strategic
concern. This means treating the environment as integral to overall
business planning and decisionmaking, and managing it as such.
<P>
These practices will, in the long-term, create wealth and propel
the Mediterranean towards prosperity and long lasting peace.

<H3>Monday, November 27, 1995</H3>

<P>
IT-policy and the Use of information and communication technology
in the German Foreign Office
<P>
Mr. Pius Fischer, Head of the Section for IT Policy
<P>
German Foreign Office
<P>
Presentation of IT-projects of Foreign and Commonwealth Office
<P>
Head of Strategy Group
<P>
Foreign and Commonwealth Office, London
<P>
Panel discussion with participation of the representatives of
German and UK Foreign Office
<P>
National experiences in the use of IT in the German and British
Foreign offices were shared through separate presentations by
Mr Fischer, Head of the IT section of the German Foreign Office
and Mr Bradford, Head of Strategy Group of the British Foreign
Office. The experiences were further deliberated upon in the ensuing
panel discussion.
<P>
The salient points of Mr Fischer's presentation on IT were: A)
to make work easier and more effective, to speed up transmission
of information and instant access to information; B) to facilitate
communication between missions and ministries of the German Government;
and, C) cooperative decision making, coordination and participation
in decision making through IT.
<P>
He elaborated upon achievements of the German Foreign Office in
the use of IT tools. It was an impressive expose of the high degree
of computerization in various German offices. He informed the
group that there were seven thousand users in the German Foreign
Service and so far 229 Missions have been connected on a Wide
Area Network. The system was used as a world wide network based
on modern technology and customized according to each user's requirements.
The German Foreign Office has arranged extensive training facilities
at headquarters, as well as, in missions which made easy the task
of utilizing the systems potential to the maximum. The system
ensured adequate confidentiality and security against any unauthorized
use. Participants appreciated the achievements but probed specifically
into areas of security management of the system and the cost factors.
<P>
The British representative's presentation mainly focused on the
dismal performance of the system in the late Eighties and early
Nineties when it was adopted without the thoughtful planning and
assessment of available resources. The British FCO had to incur
a net loss of twenty million pounds due to erroneous planning.
However, the situation was quickly rectified in the light of the
Wilding Report of 1978 and Coopers and Lybrand Report of April
1991.
<P>
He was quite candid in admitting that the in built conservatism
of the FCO in adopting new technologies was also responsible for
problems. He then listed certain contributing factors: lack of
resources, security aspects and personnel reluctance to switch
over to new technologies as key reasons for the comparatively
slow introduction of IT in the FCO. However, at the same time
he briefed the group about benefits which can accrue from the
adoption of IT in Foreign Services in a strategic manner. He also
suggested that IT should not be implemented for the sake of modernization
of office methods but in accordance with the specific requirements
otherwise it can prove counter productive. He also stated that
in order to create a culture for the implementation of IT a mix
of rewards and punishments along with change in organizational
structure and planning methods were a pre requisite. He advocated
a cautious approach in this regard and warned about high costs
both in terms of wastage of financial and human resources if proper
planning was not adopted. He also highlighted the fact that to
secure adequate funds for IT, the FCO had to embark upon a concerted
campaign of redundancy of staff. So far 390 jobs at various levels
had been retrenched and another 150 would be surrendered soon.
<P>
Mr Bradford's pragmatic presentation appealed to participants
who acknowledged the need for proper planning in view of the peculiar
developing structure of their economies and financial constraints.
<P>
The panel discussion was very stimulating in view of the shared
concerns and fears about the future and impact of IT in the foreign
services of developing countries. While Mr. Fischer optimistic
about the implementation of IT in the German Public Service, Mr.
Bradford pleaded for a cautious approach to avoid wastage of human
and financial resources.

<P>
This presentation focused on the sharing of information resources
among and between the various groups and organizations within
the State. Mrs Cassingena's argument was that the rapidity of
the changes being wrought by IT required an holistic and coordinated
approach towards the management of one's information resources.
She essentially advocated the sharing of the information resource
through an information network across sectors.

to the users to prevent monopoly by the former. Works and inventions
used to be protected by the Patent, Trademark or Copyright of
the producer. As protection laws and legislations became increasingly
challenged, legislators decided to come up with more methods of
protection such as Protection against Unfair Competition/Antitrust
Law, Trade Secret Law and Contractual. Dr. Camilleri reiterated
on the different national and international legislations which
govern the protection of intellectual property. These legislations
date as far back as 1952 with the Universal Copyright Convention
which was revised in 1971. She looked at the protection of software
within the existing legislative framework illustrating her argument
by the recent United States-China dispute over the production
of US copyrighted software in China.

<B>Introduction :</B>
<P>
IT has led to a new political, economic and social environment
for international relations which is characterised by interdependence,
interconnectivity and profound change. The impact of these changes
are both positive and negative.
<P>
<B>IT and changes in modern society</B> 
<P>
  - IT has fueled the transition from the industrial towards the
information society.
<P>
<B> IT and sovereignty</B> 
<P>
- IT has not superseded but eroded sovereignty. The national legal
system, for example, can be by-passed by network 
<P>
  piracy and the accessing of pornography where prohibited.
<P>
<A HREF="#Joe_Woods">IT and international relations (concept of power)</A>

<P>
- IT has produced not only a change in the concept of power but
also in the source of power. As a consequence of
<P>
  IT, for example, the economic clout of the Republic of China
has been recognised despite the political standing of the
<P>
  People's Republic of China, inter alia, as a permanent Member
of the United Nations.
<P>
- Fibre optics, has, additionally, changed geopolitics in that
Marseilles, France, is now the new geopolitical centre, a
<P>
   position formerly held by Gibralta, Malta and Cyprus.
<P>
<B>IT and cultural diversity</B> 
<P>
- Through IT all States have the means to promote and exploit
their own cultures and interests.
<P>
<B>IT and international economy</B> 
<P>
- IT has facilitated the economic growth of the &quot;Asian Tigers&quot;.
<P>
<B>Evaluation:</B>
<P>
- IT is to modern society what rail was initially to industry.

<P>
- Information has always been power, but it is now no longer the
monopoly of big and /or rich countries.
<P>
- Are the resultant implications being applied in national policy
and personal lifestyle goals?

<P>
Introduction:
<P>
Thesis: IT should not be for its own sake( titillation, bemusement)
but rather for <A HREF="#Commonwealth">empowerment.</A> 
<P>
Main points:
<P>
The ability to produce a value -added component is now a resource
in itself. The possession of natural resources is therefore no
longer obligatory for economic growth.
<P>
Interdependence and interconnectivity producing globalisation
now means that &quot; the world's problems are now yours&quot;,
that is , the national context is now affected.
<P>
This new environment produces opportunities and threats. The response
can either be reactionary or proactive and visionary. The former
results in despair and fear. Embracing the latter can lead to
a quantum leap.For example, the appreciation of the concept of
interconnectivity emphasised by Mediterranean litoral States has
caused a policy shift in the political and economic relation between
the European Union and the Mediterranean.[Hyperlink : Maltese
intiative on stability to Eureo-Mediterranean Conference.] IT
and globalisation constitue the motto of Malta's Vision 2000 strategy
by which it is hoped to make Malta a leader in international business
and restore her as the hub of the Mediterranean.
<P>
A further consequence is the potential for a shift in the global
balance of power in international relations between small and
third States. It was stressed that the Commonwealth could take
the lead in this regard.
<P>
Size is therefore no longera disadvantage but an asset, given
the generally greater adaptability and homogenity of small States.
<P>
Small States can now participate competetively in new strategic
alliances with big States. For example, Malta is now being considered
as a hub by the United States to access North African market.
<P>
Maximisation of IT requires an attitude shift for sustainable
development.
<P>
<A NAME="Commonwealth">Evaluation</A> 
<P>
-Are the implications of IT in the new global environment being
applied in national policy? From Mr. Wood's presentation, the
answer is a resounding 'yes' in the case of Malta.
<P>
- Mr. Wood's concept of 'quanatum leap' and attitude shift' though
reminiscent of former United States President Ronald Reagan's
&quot;Star Wars', is intriguing with historical precedent in the
development of technology in general. It should therefore be tested
in the very context he proposes: a new attitude and strategy for
small states in the commonwealth. For example, the Commonwealth
should adopt a pilot project whereby its small states not only
network in an agreed area of strength/advantage, but also establishing
an area of strategic alliance with bigger sister commonwealth
states.

<B>IT INITIATIVES IN THE COMMONWEALTH</B>
<P>
Presenter: Dr. Sajda Qureshi, Commonwealth Seceretariat, London
<P>
Introduction
<P>
Analysis of national development of countries have shown that
the locus of growth of national economic development cannot merely
be explained in terms of labour and capital. There is a third
factor and it is the technological factor. On a world scale, the
evolution of completed strategic planning as a field of practice,
which began during the 1960s decade, views the 1990s decade as
the decade during which human resources development and utilisation
and technology and development are, and progressively become,
the centre-piece for national development plans of developing
countries countries. For the 1990s and beyond, technology and
human resource development can be described to be inseparable
elements of sustainalble development.
<P>
Main points:
<P>
- IT is disseminated throughout the Commonwealth by
<P>
: products, example: equipment, assembly plants and production
tools
<P>
: human resources; training (individual, group, exchanges, attachnments,
expert and technical assistance, skills upgrading (industrial,
technical, vocational)
<P>
: technology transfer (institutional development, settimg up computer
and data communications networks, rehabilitation of small industrial
enterprises, advisory services, research and development and information
exchange)
<P>
- The source for data on Commonwealth IT initiatives is the Commonwealth
Debt Recording and Managing System (CS - DRMS)
<P>
Evaluation
<P>
Secretariat IT initiatives which have particular significance
for the development and attainment of Commonwealth Secretariat
and member state prioroties are, respectively the Informal Consultative
Group of Information Technology for Development (ICGITD) via a
computer and telecommunications network among identified officials
only from a rangr of international agencies, and the Commonwealth
Secretaarit Debt Recording and Management System and the concept
behind GOVERNET.

<P>
Main Points:
<P>
How to Choose the right OS?
<P>
:Hardware - combining the old with new equipment will be more
costly in the long run, than investing in all new equipment
<P>
: Users - internal, national, external
<P>
- key players [Hyperlink: summary notes, sxth page, Helga Pizzuto]
<P>
: networking - application of both local area network (LAN); wide
area network (WAN)
<P>
: Internet connection - most direct, easily available node should
be used
<P>
: security - protection should be a joint decision that is, based
on wide consultation [Bookmark: eighth page, Ivanovic]
<P>
: Available software - [Bookmark: ninth page, Ivanovic]
<P>
- [ Hyperlink: Tucker presentation]
<P>
: Budget - The larger ones budget, the more one can satisfy all
aspects of the highest expectations of OS
<P>
[Bookm,ark: sixth and final (future of OS) presentation by Ivanovic]
<P>
Evaluation
<P>
- A trained, updated human resource user and support system whichn
includes human alertness and accountability as the best basis
for security and protection, are the ideal prerequisites for sustainable
MFA OS
<P>
- Networking (LAN and WAN) is the best mechanism for an effective
MFA OS. In this context the Maltese Legal Materials Database has
the potential to be an invaluable resource tool not only for MFAs
globally, but also for relevant regional and international organisations

<B>Electronic Messaging</B> 
<P>
<B>Dr. Spackman, Management Systems Unit Ltd.</B> 
<P>
<U>CHANGING PARADIGMS</U> 
<P>
This presentation focused on the significance of electronic messaging
for Governments. The role and function of conducting government
business is changing as a result of the introduction of Information
Technology (IT) which now facilitates interaction while engendering
productivity and at the same time breaking down the barriers of
time and space.
<P>
<U>THE TECHNOLOGY OF PARADIGM SHIFT</U> 
<P>
The general acceptance of all technology follows the same curve.
There is first of all a resistance phase, evidenced by a slow
curve at the introduction of new technology followed by a slow
induction phase and then a rapid acceptance phase. The growth
begins to fall off at the point of general acceptance of the technology
as a normal way of doing things. At some point in the period of
general accepance a new technology emerges.
<P>
The question that then arises is to recognise the point at which
one should shift from the old to the new technology. This is the
paradigm shift.
<P>
<U>NEW PARADIGMS</U> 
<P>
The effects of the new paradigms have dictated new roles on governments
from one of exerting control to one of service. Governments gave
been forced to become increasingly outward looking and open to
national and public scrutiny as well as global sharing of information.
Governments now see their roles as that of facilitators and supporters
of private enterprises through the provision of appropriate environment
and infrastructures for growth.
<P>
As a result of this new role, governments have had to adopt new
managerial methods which include decentralisation of operations,
networking, sharing of organisation resources, and cooperating
with industries and business enterprises. They have equally realised
that immediacy and sharing of information through IT are necessary
tools for both survival and existence today. This has resulted
in the utilization of certain Key Technologies and their resultant
applications.
<P>
Governments have accepted the need to be part of the global electronic
network society. The use of electronic communication and information
exchange systems such as internet, with its reservations, trans-european
telematic network and the Commonwealth network for Information
Technology for Development are all part of the global network
communication.
<P>
<U>CONCLUSION</U> 
<P>
Electronic messaging has come of age because we are a networked
society . Governments worldwide must IT to the top of their political
agendas. <HR>

<P>
<B>Presentation <U>of</U> the Model of Computerisation of Ministry
of Foreign Affairs</B> 
<P>
<B>Mr. Jovan Kurbalija, Head of Unit for IT and Diplomacy.</B>

<P>
<U>MODELS FOR THE COMPUTERISATION OF THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS</U>

<P>
This presentation positioned diplomacy and the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (MFA) within the overall scheme of international interaction
among states using the Malta experience in the application of
IT. The resultant role of the MFA therefore is that of coordinating
interaction rather than imposing actions in the implementation
of foreign policy. This necessicitated a reliance, to some extent,
on the development by and experience of the business community
in strategising and planning the computerisation of the MFA.
<P>
The strategy adopted by Malta was an initial methodology of internal
network through the linkage of desk officers by Personal Computers
connected to those of Directors while the latter were linked with
that of the Permanent Secretary. This phase resulted in the introduction
of new tools in the automation of the manual tasks of the Ministry
some of which include routine and repetitive activities , information
gathering and thinking intensive activities which have been earlier
been identified.
<P>
The experience indicates that data bases are best developed in-house
for the use of the ministry or missions and that it was important
to decide what databases should be developed in-house. These should
be based on the needs and resources of the ministry. There should
be a clear identification of the procedures, levels of access,
security, applications and software and hardware required. Sources
of other databases should be identified so as to prevent duplication
of efforts.
<P>
<U>THE ELECTRONIC POST MASTER UNIT</U> 
<P>
In furtherance of the establishment of a wider network, the role
of the MFA is further enhanced as a coordinating point of information
based on interactions between other MALTESE missions, other government
ministries, the Business Community, the Academia and other economic
operators.
<P>
In the final analysis, computerisation of the foreign ministry
should have as its objective, the ease of formulation, facilitation,
and implementation of foreign policies.<HR>

<P>
<B>Public Service Reform and IT Polciy</B> 
<P>
<B>Mr. Philip Micallef, Manager, Strategy &amp; Planning Department,</B>

<P>
<B>Management Systems Unit Ltd</B>.
<P>
The major thrust of this presentation was that any reform process
should be approached from an integrated basis. This approach however,
has to balance the strategies for short, medium and long term
planning needs.
<P>
In putting forward his proposal for an integrated approach, Micallef
using the Maltese experience, recalled certain milestone events
and stressed the need for a review of the operations of government
and the role of the Public Service Reform Commission. He underscored
the need for an Information Systems Strategic Plan (ISSP) and
the key issues that should be addressed as well as the principal
factors that were critical for the success of any reform process.
<P>
In the case of Malta, the establishment of the Management Systems
Unit ( MSU) is one of the positive by-products of a successful
ISSP serving as an agent of reform in the civil service of Malta.
In pursuing its objectives and its role in the reforn process
of the public sector, the MSU undertakes strategic planning, consultancy
services, delivery and support services.
<P>
As with all reform processes, there is in Malta, a concern about
value for money as well as opportunity cost in view of the enormity
of investment by government in the process. However, the process
continues.

<H3><A HREF="#opening">Official opening</A></H3>

<P>
Twenty one <A HREF="partic.htm">participants</A> from sixteen
Commonweatlh countries were welcomed to the Workshop on the Use
of Information Technology in International Relations in Malta,
by Dr Jovan Kurbalija, Head of Unit for Computer Applications
in Diplomacy, <A HREF="http://www.medac.comnet.mt">Mediterranean Academy of Diplomatic Studies, </A>University
of Malta , Mr. Henry Alamango, Director of the <A HREF="http://www.comnet.mt">Commonwealth Network in Information Technology for Development (COMNET-IT).</A>as
well as Professor Fred Tanner, Director of the Mediterranean Academy
of Diplomatic Studies.The two institutions, sited in Malta were
co-sponsors of the Workshop in collaboration with the Maltese
Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Representatives of the Maltese Ministry
of Foreign Affairs, the Commonwealth Secretariat, and students
from the Mediterranean Academy of Diplomatic Studies in Malta
were also in attendance at the opening session.
<P>
The Workshop was officially opened by Ambassador Victor Camilleri,
Permanent Secretary in the Maltese Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
In his <A HREF="#framework">address</A> he took note of the fact
that the Workshop was being held within the context of Malta's
Third Country Programme which had recently been launched jointly
with the Commonwealth Secretariat and which, with the involvement
of COMNET-IT, would promote human resource development in Commonwealth
countries to bridge the gap between the developed and developing
countries in the acquisition of new technologies. Ambassador Camilleri
underscored the fact that &quot;... with the media and communication
explosion, diplomacy is being transformed into a new state-of-the-art
technological information network- a global village - where the
management of political, eonomic and social issues can be conducted
through the information superhighways, amongst which was the Internet...making
it possible to bring minds together, in thinking together, in
acting together in meeting the challenges of the new millenium.&quot;
<P>
The reception which followed the official opening provided an
opportunity for the participants to engage in meaningful discussion
with invited guests on a number of related issues..<HR>

<H3><A HREF="#framework">General Framework of the Workshop</A>
</H3>

<H5>Major Objectives of the Workshop</H5>

<UL>
<LI>To introduce the use of Information Technology in International
Relations to small Commonwealth developing and other states with
limited resources.
<LI>To contribute to the overall strengthening of the capacity
of the countries concerned in both conducting their external relations
and participating in a meaningful manner in subregional, regional
and worldwide diplomatic activities.
</UL>

<H5>Conceptual Approach and Methodology</H5>

<P>
The workshop activities were coordinated by Dr. Jovan Kurbalija.
Interaction was based on a conceptual and practical approach which
included the traditional format of lectures/seminars as well as
IT-based slide and multi-media presentations. Each module was
followed up by computer simulation exercises.Participants were
exposed to the varied experiences of other governments and managers
in the acquisition and implementation of information technology
in diplomatic activities by way of presentaions from representatives
of the governments of Malta, the United Kingdon and Germany as
well as representatives of the Malta Systems Unit Ltd. Particular
attention was paid to the efforts of Malta- a developing country
aspiring to membership of the European Union - in the application
of information technology in the conduct of its international
relations.
<P>
An Electronic Embassy, comprising five fully equipped computers
with multi media and Internet facilites, was set up at the workshop
to provide participants with daily practical experience in the
use of computer hardware and software applications, such as word
processing, spread sheets, databases which could be particularly
helpful in offfice automation. It was agreed that as a conclusive
exercise participants would create a Home page for the Workshop
on the Internet.<HR>

<H3>Opening of Electronic Embassy</H3>

<P>
The first session provided participants with an overview of the
various IT facilities which were available in the Electronic Embassy.
These included electronic mail and the Internet which were the
two areas of IT to which participants were hitherto least exposed
within the context of Diplomacy and International Relations.

GOVERNMENT FRAMEWORK FOR THE COMPUTERISATION OF DIPLOMACY: DEPLOYMENT
OF STANDARD INFRASTRUCTURES. by Ernest Stater
<P>
Mr Stater discussed the importance of architecture, which deals
with the blueprint of the infrastructure required. He emphasized
the importance of adhering to standard infrastructure in implementing
IT. He introduced the concept of Management Architecture and Models
available (scan slide 7, 8,9, 10). Inorder to make the
<P>
<U>COMNET.IT</U> by Mr. Henry Alamango
<P>
Mr Alamango provided a comprehensive talk on COMNET.IT its concept
and objective, processes and organisations and the Maltese Experience.
<P>
<U>Concept and Objective</U> 
<P>
COMNET.IT is to facilitate the Use &amp; Development of Computer
Networks for Exchange of Information &amp; Expertise. It was achieved
through networking of individuals, groups and institutions with
the purpose of accelerating social and economic development through
the <U>use of Computer networks.</U> 
<P>
<U>Processes and Organisations</U> 
<P>
Networking was accomplished through exchange of informations in
all levels; through workshops, discussion groups, publications,
training, provide skills and expertise. Networking also involves
commissioning of R&amp;D on the use of Computer Networks and other
IT, promotion of technical cooperation between various levels
of networks and institutions, eg strategic partnerships and alliances
of relevant organisations; access to information on various topics
available in the Internet.
<P>
COMNET.IT are in two levels: the Strategic and policy making bodies
- Board of Directors and its supporting Secretariat. The second
level is the Tactical and Operational level which links individuals,
task forces in administrative, management reforms, researches,
publication and education. It further links institutions and Operation
Centres, such as NCST, and MSU
<P>
COMNET provides services in five major areas; (I). Network start-up
help which includes advice and training packages and e-mail setup;
(ii). Research and publication which promotes networking in research
projects and receiving feedback from other networks, such as ICA;
(iii). Information Access which provides WAN such as to WWW, CAPAM,
and COMSEC; (iv). It also connects to other development programmes
with IT projects, such as through IDRC and UNDP etc.; (v) COMNET
also provides training activities for networking, communications
and IT applications.
<P>
<U>Governet/ MSU/Malta</U> 
<P>
The Maltese Government had adopted Governet as an administrative
service reform network which provides: E-mail connectivity, end-user
workshop, training, civil service reform dbase, thematic development
through operational centres and task forces, produce newsletters,
connet to internet and www etc.

<B><A NAME="project_status">Project Status</A>:</B> 
<P>
As of mid-November 1995 approximately 400 users spread over 9
sites in Malta, Gozo and even Brussels were connected to the
<P>
EGM network, having a facility to send electronic messages. Other
services introduced include the ability to send and receive fax
<P>
messages as well as Internet mail from the same user interface.
<P>
<B><A NAME="internet">X.400 and Internet Mail</A>:</B> 
<P>
The system chosen is based on industry standards and allows users
to send and receive X.400 and Internet mail from within the same
front end.
<P>
<B><A NAME="fax_messages">Fax Messages</A></B>:
<P>
Sending an electronic message to a fax machine allows communication
with anyone not having Email themselves. All messages sent to
fax machines will automatically be sent on letterheads which vary
according to the Ministry from which they originated.
<P>
<B>Remote Access:</B> 
<P>
The facility to access mail and internet services remotely via
modem is also being given to various users. This enables anyone
having a laptop/notebook or a PC at home to send and receive mail
and also use all internet services.<A NAME="general_EGM_benefits">
</A>
<P>
<B>General EGM Benefits:</B> 
<P>
EGM will bring about a number of benefits for the users in the
Ministries and Departments, not least of which will be a
<P>
consistent interface for communication, with one set of commands
for faxes, memos, file transfers, and so on. This will add value
to the Government network and enable better communication between
government departments which in turn decreases loss of time in
information handling. The impact of these benefits will ultimately
be felt even by the public in general who will receive more timely
and accurate information.

The ISN offers public access to its virtual library. It is just
what it sounds like; a modern library on the Internet. You can
access over 500 data sources that ISN is referencing. ISN therefore
serves as a supplementary bookshelf, complementing already exicting
libraries as well as providing a basic documentation in places
where specialist liberaries are not available.
<P>
The ISN virtual Library presents informationin two basic modes:
access by subject and access by regions.

1. Internet
<P>
The 10th day of the workshop started with a general introduction
to Internet, E-mail, Telnet and FTP, Gopher, Archie, Electronic
Conferences and World Wide Web (WWW) by Jovan Kurbalija. The purpose
of this session was to give the participants the conceptual background
of all these IT tools.
<UL>
<LI>Internet is global network.
<LI>Node is a point of location in home country
<LI>HTTP is indicative for home page
<LI>FTP is for file transfer protocol
<LI>Gopher is file a manager allowing the reorganisation of files.
Instead of going through all the files, you go through Gopher
to get the information guideline e.g. put in GOPHER//UN ORG
<LI>Upload means sending a file or files to pre-specified destination.
<LI>Download means receiving a file or files from other location
<LI>Caveat! With Gopher you cannot bring the full text.
<LI>To find specific information on the Net, one can use search
engines such as Yahoo. This engine is based in Princeton University.
Such other engines include Lycos, CityNet, etc.
<LI>UNIX is an operating system based on a command line. It is
similar to MS-DOS, but it offers many more possibilities. This
is why it is used by most universities.
<LI>Microsoft Windows NT is a 32 bit operating system with graphic
interface.
</UL>

<P>
Moving from concepts to practice, Mr. Kurbalija informed the participants
that he had decided to create a web-site containing all the informations
about the workshop: Programme, list of participants, documents
of the workshop. The structure of this Web site was drafted. Participants
were to create homepages containing the report of each day. For
this purpose participants were divided in groups and given specific
assignments. <HR>

<P>
2. Administration of Foreign Affairs
<P>
Mr. Gaetan Nauci, Director of Cooperate Services in the Maltese
Ministry of Foreign Affairs presented his country's experience
in the introduction of IT in diplomacy. He introduced his speech
by warning the audience that the use of IT was not a panacea.
 Introducing some humour, Mr Nauci said that for some pessimists
the organisation of tomorrow will have two main actors : a dog
and a man. The dog's function will be to prevent man from using
machine and man's function will be to feed the dog. For the optimists
on the other side, machine will do everything and man will just
have to dance  and make love. 
<P>
IT is only a tool to assist in arriving at given objectives. Before
investing in IT , the Government has to address certain key questions
: Is there any need for IT ? What are the advantages of IT compared
to other means of communication ? How should IT be acquired ?
What are the costs of introducing IT and maintaining it ? What
quality is required ? Will IT bring any constraints ? All these
questions imply that a sound feasibility study should carried
out before any commitment is made. This study should give a guarantee
that the equipements are maintainable , adjustable to accommodate
the technology required, up-to-date and competitive with the latest
on the market. 
<P>
Talking from his own experience, he advised that when purchasing
equipments, one should look for the best value for money and not
necessarily the cheapest on the market.
<P>
The introduction of IT in the Maltese Ministry of Foreign Affairs
raised some fears. People were usually afraid of change and many
examples of  inconveniences of IT such as being time consuming
, insecurity, impersonal management, more paperwork, lack of visible
management..
<P>
Nevertheless, the introduction of IT has improved the financial
management of the Ministry. With the Department Accounting System(DAS)
, the Ministry now has a proper budgeting and  a timelier and
better financial management; debtors and creditors are now well
known and convenient reports can easily be obtained.
<P>
He stated finally that if IT is not hurting, then it is not working.
In this business one has to be neither over pessimist nor over
optimist but simply realist.
<P>
During the discussion Mr. Nauci explained that for security reasons,
the use of IT would not replace the traditional mailing systems(diplomatic
bag, diplomatic cargo, and courier services). On the security
of the accounting system, Mr. Nauci said that those actually giving
needed authorisations at various levels will continue to do the
same job but would use a system of passwords whereby each officer
would access only  information relevant to his or her hierarchical
position. An incription system has already been elaborated on,
in order to ensure the security and confidentiality of IT messages.
<HR>

<P>
3. Multimedia - Use in Diplomatic activities. Case Study : Hypermedia
Presentation of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Malta.
<P>
On behalf of the Multimedia Team of the Mediterranean Academy
of Diplomatic Studies, Mr. Milenkovic presented a hypermedia application
built in MS Viewer authoring software. It consisted of the following
main topic groups :
<P>
 A.Ministry of Foreign Affairs
<UL>
<LI>Policy-Foreign of Malta
<LI>- Organization of Maltese Ministry of Foreign Affairs
<LI>-Our Home : Palazzo Parisio Building
</UL>

<P>
This allowed the participants to have an unexpected overview of
the Maltese History.
<P>
  B. Mediterranean Academy of Diplomatic Studies.
<UL>
<LI>- Profile of the Academy
<LI>- Research and Meetings
<LI>-Degree Programmes
</UL>

<P>
   C. IT Projects
<UL>
<LI>-Course in Diplomacy
<LI>-Diplomacy and Information Technology
<LI>-Database of International Legal Documents
</UL>

<P>
Being hypermedia means that the materials consist not only of
a text and images, but also of video clips and sound pieces, organised
in an ordered fashion and connected with hyperlinks, very much
like www pages.
<P>
Hypertext concept has been explained and true hypertext features
(jump another piece of information, insertion of embedded paragraphs
, pop-up windows, graphical navigation map) were discussed in
comparison with www hypertext features.
<P>
The technical methods of acquiring graphical , video and sound
material were explained and advice for acquiring them were given
.<HR>

<P>
4. Electronic Embassy : How to create home pages.
<P>
Mr. Kurbalija informed the participants that he wanted to engage
the creation of home pages for the workshop. It was suggested
that the group as a whole would create a great website for the
workshop. Each two participants were assigned to write on deliberations
on a specific day. Methods and procedures of creating homepages,
hyperlinks, bookmarks etc. were explained . 
<P>
The participants then started creating homepages and some remained
in the computer room over midnight.

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>The Hon. Prof. Guido DE MARCO</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>,
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs, Malta </FONT>
<HR>

<P>
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen <BR>

<P>
I thank you for giving me the opportunity to address another seminar
organised by the Mediterranean Academy for Diplomatic Studies.
I have strong affinity in the work of this Academy and I have
a great interest in its expansion and further success. Coming
here to discuss topics of world affairs is an exercise in international
relations. The fact that Prof. Bin is holding the Italy Chair
at this academy as being the mover of this conference on Co-operation
and Security in the Mediterranean after the Barcelona Conference,
I think has to be commended because it reflects more aspects than
one. It reflects this Mediterranean approach. It reflects Italy's
involvement in Euro-Mediterranean Affairs. In fact, as Prof. Tanner
has quite rightly pointed out, the fact that this is being held
in Malta reflects the role which Malta envisages, namely that
which aims at regularising relations in our regions. This is a
region which requires stability. This is a region which is in
turmoil. In Barcelona, we tried to create the basis for dialogue,
which in essence is what we are going to discuss today; What Co-operation:
what security in the Mediterranean following Barcelona? <BR>

<P>
Western civilisation knows its origins to the Mediterranean region.
It was here, in one country or other bordering the Mediterranean
littoral, that the development of western civilisation was unfolded
over many centuries. This momentum, however, was not sustained.
Our region regrettably lost the initiative and allowed other countries,
whether it be in other parts of Europe and elsewhere, to take
over what it had painstakingly developed in the first place. It
was no longer the principal actor in the drama of the history
of mankind. Instead, the region sank into an era of ideological
differences and internecine wars which undermined and held back
political, economic and social development. <BR>

<P>
Although the Mediterranean offers all the potential advantages
of a place of convergence, it has more often been an arena of
conflict than a forum for promoting complementarity and unity.
Despite a common patrimony in civilisation and many linkages,
the Mediterranean region remains today separated by contentions
and rifts. <BR>

<P>
We face, in our region, a multitude of complex challenges and
problems, ranging from economic deprivation, environmental degradation,
population explosion and migration to ethnic friction, intolerant
fundamentalism and the escalation of nationalism, the arms trade
and the disregard for international law. <BR>

<P>
There are, in my view, four challenges which are undermining peace
and stability. The first, is the huge economic discrepancy between
the northern and southern countries of the region which is intensifying
the root problems. These include weak economic structures, state
indebtedness, high demographic growth, and an alarming level of
unemployment. I will return and elaborate on this point later
on. <BR>

<P>
The second is the emergence on the southern shores of the Mediterranean
of extremism characterised by terrorism. Socio-economic crises
tend to form a fertile ground for extremist ideologies. The movement
negates universal values and offers no democratic alternatives.
If allowed to spread, it will turn back the clock to dark ages.
<BR>

<P>
Third is a prosperous arms trade, which is growing to the detriment
of economic and social development. The concentration of military
arsenals in the Mediterranean basin remains at alarming levels
because of a preoccupation with declared or potential conflicts.
<BR>

<P>
Fourth is the ecological factor. The pollution of the Mediterranean
Sea is reaching proportions which are alarming. Instead of being
treated in line with its ecological value and as an important
economic resource, the Mediterranean is being considered as everybody
else's domain. Unless together, we do not devise and implement
good-management-of-the-sea measures, the ecological factors will
constitute more instability in region. <BR>

<P>
Added to these challenges is the difficulty of putting into practice
a standard of international law. The lack of standard legality
is hampering the function of the Middle East peace process and
holding up further progress in the resolution of other pending
conflicts, such as those in Cyprus, the Western Sahara, Lebanon,
the former Yugoslavia and the Balkans among others. <BR>

<P>
The result of these and other challenges is insecurity and instability
not only on the southern shores of the Mediterranean region, but
for the entire region. The complexities of the problems that face
us today are such that it is becoming increasingly difficult to
confront them individually and in isolation at the level of separate
states. They necessitate an active participation and genuine solidarity
between all member states of the region. <BR>

<P>
The concept of security is constantly being re-examined and re-evaluated.
In the aftermath of the Second World War, it was thought the security
questions could be resolved by concluding military pacts. Later,
security was associated with arsenals of nuclear weapons and naval
fleets. This political-military strategy which dominated East-West
relations and influenced the North's relations with the South,
led to frustrations, bitter arguments and stalemates. <BR>

<P>
The failure of the political-military strategy led political thinkers
to seek other options to collective security. They developed the
concept of co-operative security. Whereas collective security
is an arrangement for deterring aggression through military preparations
and defeating it when it occurs, co-operative security is designed
to ensure that organised aggression cannot start or be prosecuted
on any large scale. <BR>

<P>
The strategic principle of co-operative security is to enhance
peace and security through institutionalised consent rather than
physical coercion. It seeks collaborative rather than confrontational
relationships among national military establishments. The emphasis
is less on preparation to counter threats than on the prevention
of threats in the first place. Thus, the significance of confidence-building
is obvious. <BR>

<P>
Co-operative security gave rise to the policy of d&eacute;tente
advocated so strongly by the then US Secretary of State and National
Security Advisor, Dr Henry Kissinger and their inviolability and
a commitment not to interfere in the internal affairs of signatory
members. <BR>

<P>
From our perspective, the Helsinki Final Act will always be remembered
in that it was for the fist time that on Malta's initiative security
and co-operation in Europe became linked to security and co-operation
in the Mediterranean region the so called Mediterranean Basket.
More than twenty year ago, in a world still dominated by the Cold
War the Conference for Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE)
recognised the need to promote the development of good neighbourly
relations with non-participating Mediterranean states. This nomenclature
of non-participating Mediterranean States within the OSCE created
a negative environment. It was through Malta' initiative that
in the OSCE Permanent Council December 1995 meeting in Budapest
the nomenclature was turned into Mediterranean Partners for co-operation.
This change in nomenclature is not just of cosmetic value. This
change, in so far as Malta is concerned, was made for explicit
purposes. One cannot participate for non-participation purposes.
One can only participate with partners. This is why Malta was
behind this change in nomenclature. <BR>

<P>
It is on this basis that the European Union has taken the initiative
to found the Renewed Mediterranean Policy. In 1989, it declared
its New Mediterranean Policy in view of the changes in the international
political situation, the globalisation of the economy, the widening
imbalances between North and South, and the completion of the
EU single market. The European Union, in order to be in a position
to withstand competition from the two main strategic areas of
America and Asia, has extended its partnership areas such as:
EFTA, Central and Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean countries.
<BR>

<P>
As a result of the Euro-Mediterranean Conference which took place
in Barcelona in November 1995, the 15 member states of the European
Union and the 12 countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea established
the basis for a lasting framework of collaboration. I am using
the word with a measure of optimism. The Declaration of the Barcelona
Conference gave three reasons for its desire to give a new dimension
to the future Euro-Mediterranean relations based on solidarity
and co-operation. These were: <BR>

<P>
* the strategic importance of the Mediterranean; 
<P>
* the necessity to guarantee peace and prosperity in the region;
and <BR>

<P>
* the co-ordinated answer which was required by new common economic,
political and social challenges. <BR>

<P>
For these reasons, the countries which met in Barcelona &quot;resolved
to establish a multilateral and lasting framework of relations
based on a spirit of partnership, with due regard for he characteristics,
values and distinguishing features peculiar to each of the participants&quot;.
<BR>

<P>
The three aspects of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership are: 
<BR>

<P>
* strengthened political dialogue; <BR>

<P>
* the development of economic and financial co-operation; and
<BR>

<P>
* greater emphasis on the social, cultural and human dimension.
<BR>

<P>
I would like now to dwell for some time on each one of these aspects,
in order to bring into perspective the ultimate objective of the
Barcelona Declaration: the creation of a zone of peace, stability,
prosperity and co-operation based on dialogue and solidarity.
<BR>

<P>
<B>Strengthened Political Dialogue<BR>
</B>
<P>
The objective of this partnership is to consolidate peace, stability
and security in the Mediterranean region. They agreed to establish
a number of common principles and interests, acceptable to all,
which the partners would undertake to promote together. <BR>

<P>
As a starting point, they agreed to act according to the principles
of international law and of different international declarations,
such as the United Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights, respecting fundamental freedoms and guaranteeing
their free exercise. <BR>

<P>
In internal affairs, Ministers of Foreign Affairs agreed to develop
the rule of law and democracy, recognising the right to choose
and develop freely their own political, legal, social and cultural
systems, guaranteeing the respect of diversity and fighting against
intolerance and racism. They declared their readiness to abstain
from whatever direct or indirect intervention in internal affairs,
respecting the territorial integrity of all partners and using
pacific means to solve conflicts. <BR>

<P>
We agreed to act in favour of chemical, biological and nuclear
arms non- proliferation by complying with the different international
and regional non-proliferation agreements. They also concurred
on the need to organise activities to combat terrorism, organised
crime and drugs. <BR>

<P>
In order to implement the principles of the Barcelona Declaration,
a work programme is scheduled whereby senior officials will meet
periodically to conduct a political dialogue, to decide the most
adequate methods and to submit proposals for the meetings of Foreign
Ministers. <BR>

<P>
<B>The Development of Economic and Financial Co-operation: An
Economic and Financial Partnership <BR>
</B>
<P>
The objective is to build a Euro-Mediterranean zone of shared
prosperity by accelerating the pace of sustained socio-economic
development, improving the living conditions of the population,
increasing the level of employment, reducing the development gap,
and promoting regional co-operation and integration. 
<P>
To this end, an economic and financial partnership is set to be
established based on the following guidelines: <BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>1. The gradual establishment of a free trade area
by the year 2010<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
This is an ambitious approach. An action plan is put forward,
setting out the framework, priorities and arrangements for partnership
in order to establish a Euro-Mediterranean economic area based
on free trade in accordance with the obligations arising under
the World Trade Organisation. A calendar will be negotiated in
order to eliminate tariff and non-tariff barriers on manufactured
and agricultural products, even though the latter will be progressively
liberalised through reciprocal preferential access. To facilitate
the process, it will be necessary to adopt measures concerning
rules of origin, certification, protection of intellectual and
industrial property rights, and to develop policies based on the
principle of free market economy and integration, and on an adequate
legal and institutional framework. The modernisation of the economy
and the social effect on the needy population are also important
factors in the establishment of a free trade zone. <BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>2. Economic co-operation and concerted action
<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
It is considered necessary to help internal savings, direct foreign
investment and voluntary regional co-operation, eliminating possible
obstacles. It is also important to achieve agreements between
companies, establishing an adequate legal frame for it, and to
offer to the Small and Medium-sized Enterprises technical support
programmes. The environment is considered as an important issue
tied with economic development, and therefore a short and medium
term programme will be established, which will be granted with
technical and financial assistance, giving priority to combatting
desertification. The Declaration also enhances the key role of
women in economic and social development. Finally, it is necessary
to co-operate in specific areas, such as energy and agricultural
policy and to improve infrastructures, to promote co-operation
in regional planning and in Research and Development to harmonise
statistical techniques. <BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>3. Financial co-operation<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
The success of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership requires an
improvement in financial assistance, that should be managed by
local agents to achieve an indigenous and sustainable development.
The European Union has promised 4,685 million Ecu for the period
1995-99 through MEDA programme, in addition to loans from the
European Development Bank and bilateral financial loans from member
states. This co-operation will be managed on the basis of a multi-annual
programme that will be promoted through dialogue, and should take
into consideration the importance of sound macroeconomic management.
<BR>

<P>
<B>Greater Emphasis on the Social, Cultural and Human Dimension:
A Partnership in Social, Cultural and Human Affairs. <BR>
</B>
<P>
The objective is to develop human resources, promote understanding
between cultures and exchanges within civil society. In this context
of decentralised co-operation, the emphasis is placed on education,
training and young people, culture and the media, migrant population
groups and health. Greater co-operation in the field of justice
and home affairs is also envisaged, with action in particular
directed against drug trafficking, terrorism and international
crime. We have to evolve in the Mediterranean a 'people to people'
approach. I think this is of the essence of things. May I give
you Malta's specific approach about the issues I've been explaining
in so far as Barcelona is concerned. The concept of these three
pillars, the making of Barcelona as an ongoing process is the
essence for its success. We cannot speak about the spirit of Barcelona
if we refer to Barcelona in the past tense. It only has a meaning
if it is poised in an ongoing process future concept. We know
and we realise that in order to promote the social pillar and
the economic pillar, basic to all this is the first pillar, namely
the political and security pillar. 
<P>
It is with this in mind that when twenty years ago Malta launched
the concept of the linkage between the security in Europe and
security in the Mediterranean, we realised from our location in
the centre of the Mediterranean, that one cannot speak for security
in Europe if one disregards Mediterranean issues.<BR>

<P>
The fall of the Berlin Wall will have lasting effects on the future
of Europe and the Mediterranean States as far lasting as the fall
of the Bastille because it is not simply the fall of a wall; a
great divide has been broken too. It is not only a unification
of Germany which has taken place; it is a breakdown of an artificial,
ecological and military barrier. <BR>

<P>
The effects of the fall of the Berlin Wall and the effects of
the end of the Cold War, through historical coincidence happened
here in Malta with the Bush/Gorbachev Meeting. In the words of
Eduard Shevardnadze in his book. The Future is for Freedom, we
read,
<P>
&quot;in the tempestuous seas in Malta we buried the Cold War&quot;.
<BR>

<P>
Which Mediterranean therefore, do we see emerging from the end
of the Cold War? Which problems still persist from the Cold War?
The absence of having the Mediterranean poised in a confrontational
issue between the two blocs and the effects of a non-polar world
on the Mediterranean region. We are still confronted with a Mediterranean
region, having its northern shores belonging in the main to the
NATO alliance, and its southern shores fragmented in search of
an identity, troubled by an economic situation which is the main
reason for present disruptive effects. The Middle East Peace is
a process which we think is fundamental for the future of the
Mediterranean. Unless the Middle East Peace Process continues,
the Mediterranean region will find no peace. It will be the greatest
of tragedies if terrorism wins over the peace of the brave as
it was defined. And it will be one of the tragedies of history
when terrorism prevails over dialogue. I think both Chairman Arafat
and Shimon Peres were very clear when they stated in no uncertain
terms that it was easier to wage war than to wage peace. Peace
can only be brought about through dialogue and it is through dialogue,
where the present problems can be discussed and eventually solved,
that Malta believes that there is no alternative to the Peace
Process. <BR>

<P>
It will be the tragedy of us all to succumb to terrorism and stop
a process which can be the only way to guarantee a future for
the people of the Mediterranean region and beyond. We think again
that for the Mediterranean region to discover itself, it needs,
above all stability. On the 20th March 1995, I had the privilege
to attend the Final Conference of the Pact on Stability in Europe,
the so called Balladur Plan. And there for the first time Malta
launched its proposal for a Stability Pact for the Mediterranean,
a Stability Pact which has to be not inspired by the same reasons
and by the same situation which exist in Europe, particularly
in Central and Eastern Europe, nor necessarily by the same round
table approach which was evolved, particularly, for minority issues
in Central and Eastern Europe. The concept of stability for our
region has to be clearly seen by identifying the sources, and
the elements destabilising the Mediterranean, be they terrorism,
or fundamentalism. In this context, I will never use the phrase
Islamic fundamentalism. This is one of the misnomers which is
creating a lot of harm and a lot of misunderstandings. Islam is
one to the great religions, one of the peace factors in global
affairs. And identifying a retrograde approach with a religion
which has permanent values is one of the mistakes which sometimes,
we in politics and some also in diplomacy, manage to commit. 
<BR>

<P>
Fundamentalism is one of the sources creating the destabilising
factors in our region. The same applies also to massive unemployment
which exists in so many regions. There are areas with 50/60% unemployment.
There are areas where we have not only the classical proletariat,
but where an intellectual proletariat, has been created, with
ambitions of power, using the emotive forces created by poverty
in order to ensure a situation where there is a revoking of power
games. Are these the factors that destabilise the Mediterranean
region? <BR>

<P>
May I also say that in this region of ours there are two Curtains.
One creating a stronger barrier than the other. These are the
Poverty Curtain and the Prejudice Curtain. These two curtains
that are creating a great divide in the Mediterranean region.
That is why Malta has proposed the Stability Pact for the Mediterranean.
We appreciate the fact that the French Foreign Minister De Charrette
in Barcelona has also advanced the concept of a Stability Pact
for the Mediterranean. I think it will be certainly a major contribution
to preventive diplomacy having this Stability Pact in place. May
I also add that we have always tended to look at the Mediterranean
in a vertical approach. We suggest that to this vertical approach
should be added the horizontal approach. That is why we have suggested
time and time again, a Council for the Mediterranean; an Association
of Mediterranean States; a Partnership between Mediterranean states;
which does not amount only to the economic partnership envisaged
in the second pillar of Barcelona. Through this horizontal approach
towards the Mediterranean one can evolve a different framework
where the Mediterranean can dialogue. A dialogue taking place
both at governmental level and at parliamentary level. <BR>

<P>
The oldest European institution is the Council of Europe, a Council
where we used to have committees for non-member states, when at
the time, we used to look at the Council of Europe as a beacon
directed towards the Central and Eastern European countries and
also towards the Iberian Peninsula. And this beacon lit. Today
the Council of Europe, which some describe as a club, has created
a European democratic space from the Atlantic further into the
Urals. We in the Mediterranean, without imitating but merely by
adapting ideas, which were proven right, can adapt to our own
region. And this is why we believe that starting from a Council
of the Mediterranean, an Association of Mediterranean States,
we can build this concept of dialogue in this explosive region.
<BR>

<P>
This is something which we have to realise. We have no time to
spare. I have always repeated that the Mediterranean is a time
bomb with an ever shortening fuse. It is difficult to speak about
a Mediterranean identity. We take this Mediterranean region with
all components: whether Europeans, whether Arabs, or whether belonging
to the Middle East. But when we speak about a Mediterranean identity,
it is difficult and on the other hand, understandable, that we
have common interests, common concerns and that we have a common
heritage. <BR>

<P>
So without losing our own identity, I believe we can and will
ensure a process in the Mediterranean region which will create
stability. We need stability. If we face this challenge, the Mediterranean
challenge, much will be achieved both for us belonging to the
region, and for those beyond. This is why the Mediterranean which
resulted from the Barcelona Conference, has to be an on-going
process, a dynamic process, a peace process. <BR>

<B>THE EURO-MEDITERRANEAN PARTNERSHIP: AN INTERPRETATION FROM

<HR>

<P>
The Euro-Mediterranean Partnership (EMP), established by the ministerial
conference held in Barcelona on 28-29 November 1995, is the framework
in which the European Union (EU) is going to develop its new Mediterranean
policy in the years to come. Partners to the EU in this undertaking
are twelve Mediterranean non-member countries (MNC) of the Middle
East and North Africa (MFNA) area with more or less long-standing
relations with European institutions. This paper describes the
most important aspects of this policy and comments on its rationale
and prospects. <BR>

<P>
<B>Mediterranean instability and European security <BR>
</B>
<P>
As with Eastern Europe, the new relationship the EU is now seeking
to articulate with the MNCs stems primarily from security concerns.
Ongoing trends of political and economic instability in the region
affect European security perceptions. The EU proposal to its twelve
Mediterranean partners to set up an EMP is the collective European
policy response to security challenges emanating from Mediterranean
instability. Security and instability are hardly new problems
in the area. However, the end of the Cold War, the collapse of
the Soviet Union and the growing role Asian and Latin American
countries are acquiring on international markets have added new
and important dimensions to old challenges. Consequently, although
the completion of the bilateral treaties between Israel and the
negotiating Arab countries remains the cornerstone of the peace
process, the need to further the process by securing region wide
conditions for disarmament, socio-economic development and political
normalisation is just as important. Besides, while the ongoing
peace process focuses on the Near East and is predicated on the
US political role, the new challenges involve the wider MENA area
and require a growing European regionalist engagement. Proximity
is bound to assume a more important role as soon as the peace
process goes into the stage of consolidation and normalisation.
It is in this new post-peace landscape that the EMP is expected
to perform at its best, beside other multilateral and international
co-operation spheres like the MENA Economic Summit, and the REDWG
(Regional Economic Development Working Group) and ACRS (Arms Control
and Regional Security Working Group), both set within the multilateral
dimension of the Madrid Conference. <BR>

<P>
<B>Weak national consensus and socio-economic</B>
<P>
<B>underdevelopment<BR>
</B>
<P>
In the changing Mediterranean situation, the EU is called on to
help provide a response to two of the many factors of instability:
first, the absence or weakness of pluralism and consensus in Arab
domestic politics; second, the worsening of economic and social
conditions throughout the MENA area. A few words must be said
about these two trends before dealing with the EMP and its policies.
<BR>

<P>
Since the revolution in Iran in 1979, European public opinion
has been more and more impressed by the rise of political Islam
in the MENA area and its blatant anti-Western attitude. It tends
to perceive Islamism in itself (and eventually Islam as a culture)
as a challenge to its security. There is no doubt that the West
is regarded by Islamists as an enemy in many respects, in particular
because Western culture is seen as an instrument of global power
and oppression in the disguise of universal values, and because
the West is believed to support the regimes the Islamists are
strenuously fighting against. One should not overlook, however,
that Islamists are primarily opposed to domestic regimes and participate
beside other forces in national political processes. Islamists
must be regarded as part of a wider domestic opposition against
largely delegitimised governments strongly determined to hold
onto power. <BR>

<P>
The varying segments of the opposition have differing views about
the reasons current Arab governments are delegitimised. According
to the Islamists, governments have proved unable to assert Arab
and Muslim interests, like the liberation of Palestine, mainly
because they became subservient to the West and do not comply
with the <I>sharia</I>, thus causing the spiritual corruption
that eventually explains their political incompetence). Present
governments are accused of the same incompetence and subservience
to Western interests by old-fashioned nationalists. On the other
hand, the argument put forward in liberal quarters is that &quot;political
participation and palpable improvement in the quality of life&#133;
was sacrificed on the high altar of Arab nationalism&quot;. Given
that the regimes have neither achieved the objectives of nationalism
nor delivered an improvement in the quality of life, they have
lost legitimacy and should restore the political freedom that
their citizens have sacrificed in vain. In this framework, it
is only too obvious that Europe is attracted by the liberals,
while looking more than suspiciously at Islamists. However, the
central question from the point of view of European security pertains
less to the individual arguments and goals of the opposition than
to the fact that current governments deny pluralism and are unable
to integrate the opposition forces into some form of national
consensus. 
<P>
This is the real factor from which instability springs and, therefore,
the factor which affects European security and has consequently
to shape EU Mediterranean policies. <BR>

<P>
As for MENA socio-economic development, things are more evident.
The worsening of social and economic conditions in the region
with respect to other less developed regions has become clear
in the nineties. A report published by the World bank in October
1995 points out that in the last decade the MENA countries suffered
the largest decline of real per capita income (approximately 2%
a year) of any developing region and a 0.2% annual decline in
productivity. As a consequence of this decline in productivity,
the MENA countries achieve about half the output per unit investment
of East Asian countries. 
<P>
This economic decay coalesces with high rates of population increase
to stir both high unemployment and migrations. 
<P>
Poverty and unemployment are the most important - though certainly
not the only - factors in thickening Islamist ranks and feeding
extremism. In this framework, migration is characterised by a
widespread need to assert identity from a cultural but sometimes
even a political point of view. This creates attrition inside
Europe and contributes to make Europeans perceive Islam - whether
political or not - as a security risk or threat.<BR>

<P>
<B>The Euro-Mediterranean Partnership<BR>
</B>
<P>
In order to face these challenges to Mediterranean stability and
European security, the Declaration approved at Barcelona singles
out two main instruments of collective co-operation: (a) the &quot;regionalisation&quot;
of Euro-Mediterranean economic co-operation; (b) the establishment
of a mechanism for regular political co-operation and the implementation
of a common area of peace and stability.<BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>a) Regionalisation<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
The EMP agenda for economic co-operation is centred on the implementation
of a free trade area (FTA) by the year 2010 and - implicitly -
on a variety of radical changes which would enable the Arab economies
to take adantage of the growth opportunity provided by the FTA.
<BR>

<P>
The establishment of the EMP will put and end to the non-reciprocal
industrial preferences enjoyed so far by the MNCs within the framework
of their past agreements with the EU. As a consequence, while
maintaining the free access to European markets for their industrial
products (and, thanks to the Uruguay Round, expanding this access
to several previously protected products, such as textiles), the
MNCs will have to do away with protection and permit free access
to EU industrial products. At the same time, EU agricultural protectionism
will not be eliminated, though there is a general expectation
that it will be significantly reduced. <BR>

<P>
This agenda is a very serious challenge for the MNCs, for it will
bring about an extensive exposure to EU competition without providing
any significant additional market. Indeed, one may wonder why
they accepted it. The almost unanimous response is that the MNCs
had no other way out, as the agreements made under the Uruguay
Round will erode their European preferences anyway and, if they
don't proceed now to make their economies reasonably competitive,
they will become very soon more and more marginal and poor. Having
no alternative but to enable their economies to compete internationally,
the chance of doing it within a regionalist scheme may ease the
task. In fact, under the perspective of what is now called &quot;open&quot;
or &quot;new&quot; regionalism, the FTA is regarded as a way of
stimulating economies on the supply side, of compelling less developed
countries to improve productivity and of creating a &quot;public
good&quot; which will generate externalities. Another opportunity
is offered by the fact that they can pursue this option in a framework
in which they would be assisted by the EU. <BR>

<P>
For these reasons, the debate is centred, rather, on the strategies
the MNCs should adopt - such as deregulation, incentives to domestic
and foreign investment, public finance and other macroeconomic
policies - in order to go through such a difficult transition.
We won't enter into this debate here, but it must be noted that
the EMP contemplates a number of policies to help the MNCs' transition.
First, financial aid has been increased considerably (even though
per capita aid remains three times lower than that devoted to
the Central-Eastern European countries). It now amounts to 4,685
billion ECU (approximately 6billion US$), which will be coupled
by a similar amount in loans from the EIB, the European Investment
Bank. Second, unlike what used to happen with the old association
agreements, these financial resources will be previously allocated
on a country-by-country basis but will be engaged and disbursed
according to partners' individual ability to perform and succeed
in reaching assigned targets. Thirdly, the multilaterisation of
the market as well as the establishment of South-south regional
links inside the FTA is regarded within the EMP's agenda as an
essential condition for the Partnership's success. The simultaneous
enlargement of the market to all the non-EU partners should act
as an important demand-side advantage emanating from the FTA.
For this reason, beside economic restructuring and assistance
in reducing socio-economic gaps within the MNCs, part of the EMP's
financial aid will be devoted to supporting regional economic
co-operation and development. Moreover, the rules of origin will
be construed so as to give preference to products including as
much import as possible from other FTA partners. <BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>b) Political co-operation for peace and stability
<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
The EMP provides an entirely new element in the EU-MNCs relations
by establishing a mechanism for a Mediterranean political co-operation
(MPC) and by planning the implementation in the area of a &quot;common
area of peace and stability&quot;. Though the MPC may be related
to all the components of the EMP, there is no doubt that it will
above all inspire and direct the implementation of the common
area of peace and stability. <BR>

<P>
The MPC is a very light mechanism. But it is also very innovative,
in that it is not linked to specific objectives - as in other
Mediterranean co-operation schemes. It is directed first of all
to the broad task of establishing political consultation per se.
In this sense the MPC, as light as it may be, is a genuine institution,
dissimilar from, for example, the NACC (North Atlantic Co-operation
Council) or the Partnership for Peace but belonging to the same
kind of conflict preventive institutional multilateralism. <BR>

<P>
The institutional character of the MPC may prove too ambitious
with respect to the actual political cohesion of the EMP (and
therefore generate controversies or conflict) but it may also
be the only way to build up the common area of peace and stability
envisaged by the Barcelona Declaration, which is in turn just
as ambitiously predicated on the implementation of a long list
of principles related to pluralism, democracy and human rights.
Such principles (like human rights) are either eminently controversial
in Islamic-Western relations or blatantly disregarded by many
MNCs. 
<P>
It is difficult to predict whether and to what extent the Arab
regimes will comply with these principles and enable the common
area of peace and stability to materialise. To some extent the
principled common area approved at Barcelona is the price the
Arab MNCs had to pay to strengthen relations with Europe, in view
of the fact that, after the end of the Cold War and as soon as
the bilateral peace treaties in the Near East will be concluded,
US interest towards the MENA area will decrease, the need to reconstruct
the economy will prevail and Europe will necessarily become the
area's most important partner. Given this perspective, whatever
the EU will do or become, as EMP members the MNCs will retain
the advantage of having a say. But, in order to preserve such
a say, they will have to contribute to developing the EMP and,
with it, the principled common area that it includes. In order
to ensure a substantial degree of compliance and implementation
of the principles underlying the common area of peace and stability,
the MNCs' prominent political interest in developing the EPM will
be no less important than EU political conditionality and the
access to Arab civil societies provided to the EU by the EMP.

<P>
What will be the substance of the EMP's common area of peace and
stability? Beside co-operation in the field of &quot;soft security&quot;
(organised crime, terrorism and drugs problems, etc.), the pursuit
of the principles on which peace and stability are predicated
within the framework of the EMP means that it will concentrate
on attempting to develop and reinforce a Mediterranean framework
for crisis management, in particular a capacity for preventive
diplomacy and crisis prevention. The conditions for such a development
in the Mediterranean are different from those prevailing in the
OSCE area, particularly in Central and Eastern Europe. In most
of the OCSE area there are diffuse and vital interests towards
developing regional political integration and ensuring the survival
of collective security which - with the exception of the Mediterranean
countries which are candidates to become members of the EU - may
be absent or much weaker in the Euro-Mediterranean area. Nevertheless,
preventive diplomacy and crisis prevention are accepted and even
welcomed by many MNCs because, while allowing political co-operation
with the EU, they are less intrusive than other instruments of
collective security. <BR>

<P>
With respect to the variety of instruments of preventive diplomacy
and crisis prevention developed by the OSCE in the nineties and
the direct role the OSCE has been able to assume in managing prevention
functions, it is possible that a more cautious or traditional
diplomatic approach will prevail in the Mediterranean. For this
reason, the proposal put forward by the Barcelona Declaration
and stressed by France during the Conference, namely that of establishing
a Euro-Mediterranean Pact and proceeding along the lines of the
experience provided by the Pact of Stability in Europe, makes
sense. In relation to specific crises, a number of round tables
with the participation of the interested countries could be held
within the EMP. The round tables would make discussions and negotiations
possible and give the collective EMP institutions an adequate
and effective role. In European diplomatic quarters the establishment
of a Mediterranean Pact of Stability is regarded as less ambitious
and more feasible than the setting up of a Centre for Conflict
Prevention along the lines of the one working within the OSCE.
But for the time being there is no reason to rule out the possibility
of establishing such a Centre. <BR>

<P>
Apart from prevention and crises management, other security-related
aspects, like the establishment of Confidence Building Measures,
armaments reduction or control and anti-proliferation policies
may remain outside of the EMP (though the Declaration talks of
them). In principle, these issues should be tackled in other contexts,
like the Mediterranean Dialogues started by both the Western European
Union and NATO, or would require a more definite profile of the
EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy. For the time being, there
will be limits to the substance of a shared Mediterranean area
of peace and stability and this area will be based less on military-related
security than on a comprehensive concept of security. Nonetheless,
whatever these limits and the instruments the Euro-Mediterranean
partners will select to start implementing the common area of
peace and stability, this EMP dimension will emerge as a crucial
factor in carrying out Mediterranean co-operation, also because
stability and peace are essential conditions for economic reconstruction
and foreign direct investment.<BR>

<P>
<B>Conclusions<BR>
</B>
<P>
The EMP is the result of a remarkable and successful effort by
the EU to innovate and reinforce its Mediterranean policy. This
effort has been marked by both continuity and change. Continuity
is secured by the assertion of the European democratic identity,
embedded in the principles of democracy, freedom, pluralism and
respect for human rights, which have been incorporated into the
Barcelona Declaration; also, by the privileged role assigned by
the same Declaration to decentralised co-operation, the interaction
of civil societies and the development of cultural relations within
the EMP. Change is reflected in the articulation of a new structured
strategy of regionalism, predicated on the establishment of an
FTA as well as in the search or a common area of peace and stability
aimed at providing security and supporting economic development.
<BR>

<P>
For the time being, several important challenges to security and
stability, such as migration, have a minor role in the EMP. If
the EU members manage to agree upon a common policy towards migration,
the latter may become a major issue to deal with in the framework
of EMP crisis prevention. In any case, the newly-born EMP can
be regarded as an important platform for the improvement of EU
security towards the Mediterranean areas and the upgrading of
the coherence and impact of the EU's Common Foreign and Security
Policy.

<P>
There was a time the Europeans considered their security and also
their identity as being dependent on the formation of their own
foreign and security policy independently of the United States.
At present times, this is no longer true. Current relations between
the governments of the European Union and the United States are
hardly the same as they were a decade ago. It is not easy to define
such relations, but it is clear that today European identity and
security are not linked to dissociating European foreign and security
policies from the foreign and security policy of the United States.
The renewed European endorsement of the United States as the provider
of last resort of international security in the Bosnian war is
proof of such a change. In the Balkans, Wahington has again been
put in the role of security provider of last resort of the international
system, with the consent and support of European governments.

<P>
In line with such a re-orientation of European attitudes, hurrying
to formulate a foreign and security common policy (FSCP) and its
institutionalisation is turning out to be of little importance
to the Europeans. 
<P>
At the same time, it is widely admitted that more co-operation
and even a new common policy is needed in another security area:
the internal one. Such a new security co-operation has a strong
international dimension and no state can present itself as the
provider of last resort in such a field. The international dimension
of internal security is not a worry only for the Europeans, but
for all the states of the world. It is also a problem to be solved
by international co-operation. Two solemn documents recently signed
by European Union and its special partners (the traditional major
ally, the United States, and the Mediterranean neighbours) make
important declarations about this problem. The documents are the
New Transatlantic Agenda, signed in Madrid on December 1996, and
the Barcelona Declaration on the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership,
signed in the Catalan town just a few weeks before the other document.
<BR>

<P>
&quot;New dimensions of security&quot; is a frequently used term
in the current vocabulary of international relations. In past
years, researchers and professionals have repeatedly called attention
to the multiple dimension of security in today's world. Concepts
like societal security, cultural security and environmental security
are increasingly used. This paper focuses on one of the &quot;new
dimensions&quot; and the reason why internal security has approached
foreign security as an important object of intergovernmental co-operation
and as an issue of the global system.<BR>

<P>
Firstly, the paper deals with the addition of internal security
to external security in the agenda of the European Union. It deals
with the development of co-operation in justice and home affairs
(JHA) and wih the difficult (or failed) development of FSCP. 
<P>
The second subject of the paper is the nature of EU-US relations
and the presence of co-operation on international security in
the New Transatlantic Agenda. Thirdly, the paper examines the
Barcelona Declaration and the presence of co-operation on internal
security in this document. The argument of the paper is that a
single group of causes is at the origin of the presence of this
security dimension in all the most important documents of contemporary
diplomacy.<BR>

<H1>From EPC to FSCP: re-conceptualising foreign policy and security
from the European experience<BR>
</H1>

<P>
In the first fifteen years of its existence, co-operation in foreign
policy achieved better results in the organisational, institutional
and political domain than it from Maastricht up to the present.
Institutional and political results obtained in the initial period,
from the 1969 Summit in The Hague to the signature of the Single
European Act in 1985, have all not been exciting, but some of
them have been important.<BR>

<P>
If to carry out the communitarisation of foreign policy means
to progressing from 0 to 100, in the earliest fifteen years communitarisation
progressed from 0 to 10; in the following period -though moving
forward- it covered less distance. In the first period of co-operation,
committees and working groups were brought into existence; important
declarations, such as the famous Declaration on European Identity,
were issued; co-operation was set out on at the United Nations.
Finally, in 1986 the Secretariat for Political Co-operation was
created, but in 1992 the Maastricht Treaty canceled it out (See:
Allen, Rummel and Wessels, 1982; Longo, 1995; Schouteete, 1980).
<BR>

<P>
Dates are important. At the time of the signing of the Single
European Act, in 1985, the short Gorbachev era was just starting
and the Soviet Union was in trouble, though Europeans did not
realise they had left behind the so-called Second cold war (See:
Kaldor, 1990). By the time of Maastricht, in 1992, the Gorbachev
era was over, as was the Soviet Union.<BR>

<P>
What of importance for Europe and the common foreign policy took
place in the world at that time? The answer is that the world
went through two changes and, because of these, Community co-operation
in foreign policy lost its former nature and principal raison
d'etre, at least till now. However, not only EU common foreign
policy but all national foreign policies are currently in a condition
of crisis,. The term 'foreign policy' may even sound obsolete
today. To say the least, foreign policy is something very different
today from what it was yesterday.<BR>

<P>
As we have said, the world changed twice in the last few years.
The first change was that the Soviet Union disappeared and, with
it, like cold war, bipolar international politics, and so on (See,
for instance: Haftendorn and Tuschoff, 1993; Lellouche, 1992).
In addition a given Atlantic politics and typical American foreign
policy disappeared, i.e. Atlantic politics as the politics of
opposition of the Western capitalist world to the Communist bloc.
The American foreign policy of forwarding American hegemony in
the international system in rivalry to the Soviet government also
broke up.<BR>

<P>
What is there instead of Atlantic politics? The answer is &quot;trans-Atlantic
politics&quot;, in process of definition since the first Transatlantic
Declaration signed in November 1990. What is there instead of
the old American foreign policy of &quot;hegemony with rivalry&quot;
with the Soviet Union? The answear is &quot;the new American policy
of hegemony with shared responsabilities&quot; with Japan and
the European allies, which also is in process of definition.<BR>

<P>
Does this change mean something to the foreign policy of the European
Union? Obviously, yes. It means a lot. However, it is better to
clearing from the outset an ambiguity. Western European integration
has been put in relation with the Est-West divide of the international
system. Integration used to be considered chiefly as something
formented on the two sides of the Atlantic to reinvigorate Europe
and rescue it from falling into communism and under the control
of the Soviet Union. Such an interpretation is to be rejected
as a reductive theory of the causes and evolution of the European
integration process. It is not in this sense that the demise of
the Soviet Union has changed the process of foreign policy communitarisation.
<P>
The point is that the anti-American motive to common foreign policy
has been much stronger than the anti-Soviet one. The anti-Americanism
of the European integration process has been commonly interpreted
as being of an economic nature. This is a partial vision of reality.
Customs union, economic and, nowadays, monetary integration is
and always has been strongly motivated in Europe by the need to
counter American strength in the world economy. Integration is
for the Europeans the condition for prevailing in industrial and
monetary competition with the Americans and, obviously, also with
the Japanese (See: Bourrinet, 1987; Khaler, 1995; Schwok, 1991).
Since the <I>defi americain</I> of the early 1960s, nobody has
disputed this. But such an argument fits also in with co-operation
in the field of foreign and security policy. Indeed, in the 1970s
and early 1980s, European co-operation in foreign policy got a
decisive push from the anti-American claims of many social, political
and even governmental actors in Europe. It is enough to recall
the Declaration on European Identity, issued in 1973 by EC foreign
affairs ministries, and the Kissinger's anger at it. This early
- some would say premature - result of the anti-American looming
of EPC is a good proof of the fact that EPC was fuelled mostly
by the aspiration of European governments to dissociate themselvesfrom
important aspects of the American foreign policy of the time.
As examples of this &quot;aspiration to dissociate&quot; the following
cases may be recorded:<BR>

<UL>
<LI>dissociation from the war in Vietnam ( then reculing its end)
by opposing it with such declarations as the Declaration on European
identity; 
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>dissociation from the Middle-East and oil policies followed
by the American government in the late 1960s and early 1970s,
by presenting the Euro-Arab dialogue as an alternative to the
Washington diplomacy of confrontation with the oil producing and
exporting countries; 
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>dissociation from the European security policy as outlined
by the Pentagon by opposing it with Ostpolitik and the Helsinki
process; 
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>dissociation from the invasion of Grenada, the embargo on
Nicaragua, and the Latin-American policy of the Reagan Administration
by opposing it with initiatives like the San Jos&egrave; conference
explicitly aimed at creating ties between Europe and the Central
American countries, in spite of the fact that such ties had never
existed before; 
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>dissociation from the boycott of the Siberian pipeline and
the Moscow Olympic Games proclaimed by Washington; (by mere disobedience);

</UL>

<UL>
<LI>dissociation from the hard anti-Soviet stance wanted by the
United States in the CSCE follow-up conferences by showing fair
co-ordination among diplomats of the EC countries in all the meetings
of the Helsinki process. 
</UL>

<P>
It may be ojected that the list of anti-American declarations
and actions of EC countries may be countered by a similar list
of anti-Soviet positions. But this objection is not decisive.
The fact is that, when the EPC venture started, the European governments
already had appropriate diplomatic and strategic institutions
- namely, the Atlantic Pact and NATO - to neutralise the Soviet
threat. They did not enter into the EPC process either to substitute
those institutions as inefficient instruments of defence against
the Soviet enemy or to supplement them with other instruments.
At that time, the anti-Soviet stance of the European governments
was almost the same as the anti-Soviet stance of the American
government. In other words, the &quot;value added&quot; by the
EPC to the foreign policies of the European countries was not
anti-Sovietism; rather, it was dissociation from important aspects
of American foreign policy.
<P>
Briefly, in the 1970s and 1980s, European governments considered
it advantageous to themselves to loosen and reduce ties with their
American ally, which had turned uneasy. In the 1990s, instead,
that ally is turning to be an easy ally again (See: Peterson and
Ward, 1995). At the same time, co-operation in foreign and security
policy is becoming more difficult. Such co-operation, always inherently
difficult, appears today to be more difficult than ever because
it is largely purposeless - at least in the international security
area - until a re-conceptualisation of its nature is appropriately
made.<BR>

<P>
In 1991 foreign policy co-operation lost its raison d'&egrave;tre
because the end of the Soviet Union removed almost all the reasons
for dissociating European diplomacy from important aspects of
American diplomacy and strategy. Even during the Gorbachev era
- when the EU states invented the common defence policy with the
Single European Act, and later, when they invented the common
security policy with the Treaty of European Union - effective
progress toward the reorganisation of the Western European Union
(WEU) had been small.<BR>

<P>
The dissolution of the Warsaw Pact caused anxiety and fear amongthe
Europeans and rushed them to find to remedies and make plans for
what they had never been able to accomplish, i.e. the creation
of common defence structures. It forced them to consider it feasible
to take upon themselves the burden of greater military expenses,
with the blessing sight of the Washington government. However,
because the American economy was overheated at that time, to slim
NATO down by reducing the number and size of the American military
bases in Europe was a decision also in the interest of United
States (See: Attin&agrave;, 1993 b; Hyde-Price, 1991; Mcardle
Kelleher, 1993; Smith, 1993). After a short time, however, the
problem of security in Central and Eastern Europe was revealed
to be not so big as to push for the immediate creation of new
structures for common defence. After all, Central and East European
states as well as the post-Soviet states (C.I.S.) had enough domestic
problems to deal with, and no time to ignite international violence.
This could be expected unless the domestic problems of those nations
turned into violence, and domestic violence turned into international
war (See: Barb&egrave;, 1995; Braillard, 1995). The Balkans fitted
this condition, but before turning to this case we have to come
back to the second great change undergone by the world. <BR>

<P>
If the fall of the Soviet Union and its consequence for the political
organisation of the international system - i.e., the end of the
rivalry between the hegemon of the system (the United States)
and its poorer (therefore, improbable) challenger (the Soviet
Union) - may be considered a sudden change, the second one is
not a sudden change but has been creeping up on us gradually,
even if it has only been defined recently.<BR>

<P>
In a few words, the world of today is the world of globalisation
and not only of interdependence. It is the world of easy and intense
mobility and communication; the world of imperious demands for
individual and collective human rights; the world of the third
and the widest wave of democratisation; the world of fast imitation
and, at least to a certain extent, unavoidable homogenisation
of societies and cultures (See, for instance, Kennedy, 1993).
It is also the opposite of all these aspects: it is the world
of fragmentation, discontinuouity and individuation; and the world
of strenuous and even violent reaction of individuals (single
persons, groups and cultures) against the risk of being overwhelmed
by the rest of the world in a situation in which individuals realise
they cannot &quot;shut the door&quot; separating them from the
aliens (See, for instance: Friedman, 1994; Mlinar, 1992; Robertson,
1992).
<P>
In such a world, the state has lost the ability to control its
borders. It is wonder that it lacks the same ability to make foreign
and security policy as it had before such a change took effect
(See, for example: Attin&agrave;, 1993 a; Camilleri and Falk,
1992; McGrew and Lewis, 1992). In spite of this change, the state
is safe in the present international system as it has never been
before.
<P>
Everything will blow up in the air if someone decides to use nuclear
weapons, but - apart from this circumstance - no state has a reasonable
chance of being destroyed by arms used by other states. From 1945
up to the present, no state has been destroyed by military invasion.
When a state risked destruction by military invasion, someone
intervened to rescue it. Some states have died in violence in
the contemporary international system, but this was by &quot;suicide&quot;,
that is by disintegrating themselves. There are - in my knowledge
- only four divergent cases, which may be easily explained. Two
cases - South Vietnam and East Germany - were the halves of divided
states and wanted to be somehow integrated to the other half (the
same is expected to occur to the two Koreas). The two remaining
cases - East Timor and Western Sahara - were in a nascent state
and were killed almost on the verge of becoming states. Incidentally,
it may be noted also that violent disintegration is not the only
form of state disappearance. Disintegration may be &quot;smooth&quot;
- as in the case of the Soviet Union - and peaceful - as in the
Czechslovak case. State disappearance may also occur by voluntary
bilateral or multilateral integration, but no real case is known
in the contemporary international system, apart from the building
of the European Union.<BR>

<P>
The present condition of international security of states may
be explained only by making reference to a fundamental value change
in the international system. The value change is that international
security (i.e. security of states as territorial entities) is
today a collective good, not simply an individual one. This is
new and peculiar to the contemporary international system. It
was not so in past international systems. In the past the persistence
of the international system, as opposed to the persistence of
any single state was a collective good; the plurality of states
was to be assured and the formation of world empires avoided,
but the existence of single states - especially small or middle
powers - was not to be necessarily preserved. The division and
the annexation of the whole territory of a state by other states
was not excluded as contrary to the basic principles of the international
system of the time as it is excluded in the contemporary international
system.<BR>

<P>
An individual good is something that individuals secure for themselves
mainly by their own means. A collective good, instead, is something
individuals benefit from mainly because an authority makes it
available to all; individuals have only to comply with a few obligations
to avoid &quot;wasting&quot; the good. In national political systems,
the authority that supplies public goods is an institution (the
executive or a state agency). In the international political system,
instead, the authority is the hegemonic (or global) power and/or
an institution. Authors of the hegemonic theory of international
politics like Gilpin (1981), Modelski (1978) and - espcially on
collective goods - Kindleberger (1970 and 1988), have focused
on certain public goods provided by the leading power to the system
such as currency for international exchange and freedom of circulation
for international trade. In the contemporary international system,
there are at least two important changes regarding collective
goods: one is the inclusion of territorial security among the
collective goods of the system; the other one is the legitimation
role of the United Nations in the field of international security,
i.e. the U.N. role of legitimating the actions of the hegemonic
state (the United States), no matter what the content of the U.N.
Charter and what may be best for the world.<BR>

<P>
In the past, state security was acquired through national military
power and/or military alliances with the strongest state(s). In
the contemporary international system, national security is mainly
and in the last resort defended by the &quot;governmental institutions&quot;
of the system, i.e. by the United States and the United Nations.
For that reason, in current international politics making military
alliances is becoming an obsolate instrument of foreign policy.
Indeed, the number of military alliances created in the last ten
years is near to zero. The last big wave of military alliance
creation took place at the time of the so-called Second cold war
with the military pacts signed by Brezhnev's Soviet Union and
certain so-called communist states in Africa and the Arab Peninsula.
The only important exception to this decaying importance of military
alliances is Nato. It is not difficult to explain why this is
so. In the contemporary international system, only four cases
can be counted as cases of real threat to the existence of a &quot;formed&quot;
(as opposed to &quot;nascent&quot;) state by invading its territory:
they are the invasion of South Korea by North Korea, the invasion
of South Vietnam by North Vietnam, the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq,
and the invasion of Bosnia by Croatia in 1995. Other cases of
military occupation - for example, in the Middle East - can be
counted; but in those cases territorial offence was neither deliberately
intended to produce the death of the offended state nor produced
such a result unintentionally. The rescue of three attacked and
threatened states (South Korea, Kuwait and Bosnia) was carried
out by the United States under the legitimating flag of the United
Nations. In the fourth case (South Vietnam), the United States
failed as much in military intervention as in obtaining United
Nations legitimation certainly because Soviet Union had understood
the error of its conduct in the Korean affair.<BR>

<P>
It is now clear why NATO is alive and in good health. Indeed,
it grows toward the East with the Partnership for Peace and even
considers it possible to extend to the South (see the proposal
made to certain Maghreb countries in 1995). The fact is that NATO
is not a traditional military alliance. It has gradually assumed
the nature of the major military instrument of Pax Americana in
the enlarged European region. However, it is not an all-purpose
military instrument in the hand of the United States. European
allies may at any time &quot;dissociate&quot;themselves, and also
resort to the reinvigoration of the Western European Union.<BR>

<P>
The principle of territorial integrity (that is: no state be invaded
and &quot;killed&quot; by another state) goes together with the
principle of non-intervention. Taken together, such principles
imply that a state may disintegrate into many fragments without
actions by other states. The two principles are so strong today
as to be valid also for each of the fragments fallen out of a
disintegrated state, whatever the &quot;living conditions&quot;
of the fragments. 
<P>
One example is near to us. No state has been ready to intervene
to stop mass killings in Bosnia, a fragment state fallen out of
the disintegration of Jugoslavia, always itself on the verge of
exploding and subdividing in fragments. 
<P>
This is because in our international system disintegration is
allowed and no state is legitimised to impede the disintegration
process of another state by direct military intervention. But
when the Croatian army entered Bosnia to annex a piece of land
and risked producing the death of Bosnia by &quot;inviting&quot;
others (i.e. Serbia) to annex other pieces of Bosnian land, at
that time the political organisation of the international system
mobilised and reacted as, four years before, it had reacted to
the Iraq's invasion of Kuwait though Bosnia has no oil!<BR>

<P>
Mobilisation of the political organisation of the international
system means that the &quot;constitutional&quot; rules and institutions
(See: Attin&agrave;, 1989 and 1991) and the leading state(s) of
the system enter in action. In this case, the United States intervened
in Bosnia - as they had done in Kuwait and also in Korea - with
the legitimation of the United Nations, without giving to the
United Nations the control of the operations.
<P>
Also in the present international system of &quot;hegemony without
rivalry&quot;, the United States are taking on themselves the
role of security provider of last resort and they do so without
involving European allies in operations and alignments they dislike.
In such circumstances, the low interest of EU countries in deepening
the FSCP is hardly surprising.<BR>

<H1>International crime and police co-operation in the European
Union<BR>
</H1>

<P>
So far we have seen how the first and second change of world conditions
add toghether in negatively affecting the evolution of FSCP. At
the same time, the two changes affect the internal security of
states, forward the &quot;international dimension&quot; of internal
security and favour the emergence and development of the Third
Pillar in EU co-operation. Whoever accepts the claim of re-conceptualising
foreign policy, may find valuable hints in the Maastrich process.
<BR>

<P>
Since globalisation and interdependence are important characters
of the present world, especially in the economic and social fields,
foreign policy is made by the European governments, above all,
through measures for building monetary union, restructuring economic
relations with neighboring countries (the Central and Eastern
European Countries and the Mediterranean countries) and policing
state borders. It may be said that foreign and security policy
is made also with the First and the Third Pillar, and - in specific
matters - even better than with the Second one: the first to handle
the problems of economic co-operation and competition, the third
to deal with issues like international migrations (See: Collinson,
1993; Waever et al., 1993) and international crime (See: Ahnfelt
and From, 1993).<BR>

<P>
The world has problems which in their origin, growth and, solution
exceed national borders and capacities. More exactly, they cannot
be controlled and solved by state legislation and national authoritative
decisions. Their solution depends on international and supranational
regulation. This is true in such different fields as environment
(pollution), demography (migrations), health (epidemics) and public
security (organised crime, illegal business, trade in persons).
Because of the effects of interconnection that the process of
globalisation has on the politics of almost all contemporary states,
governments are able to exert the old and new functions of public
security, economic growth, health protection, social security,
etc., only if they resort to international co-operation and co-ordination.

<P>
Certain issues, affected by the globalisation process, are more
efficiently controlled by governments when they agree to co-ordinate
national policies with multilateral international policies and
regulations. Other issues - either produced or heavily conditioned
by the globalisation process - can be solved only if they enter
the agenda of co-operation at the level of the global system or,
at least, at the level of regional systems. The inclusion of a
problem in the international agenda means that the problem is
the object of the formulation of international legal norms, the
creation of competent international institutions or the attribution
of competence to already existing international institutions (See
Livingston, 1992): in other words, their solution may only be
made by issuing a world public policy.<BR>

<P>
In such a perspective, the effects of the accomplishment of the
four freedoms, scheduled in the Treaty of Rome, and of the single
market, scheduled in the Treatry of Maastricht, are not the only
reason for police co-operation in the European Union. Indeed,
they add to the effects of globalisation in causing the common
problem of protection from illegal and criminal actions in the
territory of the Union and across its borders. Co-operation in
public security is not only an instrument to protect public and
social order from the effects of opening internal borders; it
is an instrument to defend from one of the unwanted effects of
globalisation, that is international crime.<BR>

<P>
The most important form of international crime today is organised
crime, i.e. groups of people equipped with a stable, mostly hierarchical
organisation, which perpetrate illegal actions, usually using
violent means, in order to enrich themselves without consideration
for international frontiers. Important international organised
crime groups are the Mafias (Sicilian, American and Russian Mafia),
the Japanese Yakuza, the Colombian drug cartels of Medellin and
Cali, the Chinese Triads. But the phenomenon is only partially
known, and in continuous evolution. Certainly, these groups are
not unitary organisations but networks of homogeneous, loosely
subordinated groups.<BR>

<P>
An organisation may prefer to exploit a particular sector more
than others, but no orgnised crime body neglects drug trafficking,
arms trade, prostitution, people trade and international money
laundrering - the last being the natural complement of all kinds
of criminal activity, including traditional ones behind state
borders (extortion, usury, etc.).<BR>

<P>
In to the fight against international crime, whether organised
or not, there is no alternative than to collaborate and co-ordinate
national police and judiciary action. To improve such co-ordination,
agencies like Interpol and the new Europol have been constituted.
But the constitution and the operation of these agencies face
great obstacles and problems, because states have peculiar penal
law codes and institutes; they regulate police operations (like,
for instance, telephone controls, collection of information and
preventive incarceration) in very different ways.<BR>

<P>
International police co-operation has a long tradition. When crime
assumed the character of an international phenomenon, the police
responded with cross-border co-operation. During the first half
of the present century such co-operation was of an informal nature
and not based on formal agreements and conventions. The situation
changed significantly in the 1950s. Since 1956, Interpol has been
the key organisation for international police collaboration. Towards
the end of the 1950s, two important criminal law conventions -
one on Extradition (1957), the other on Legal Aid (1959) - were
formulated under the auspices of the Council of Europe (See: Gianaris,
1992-1993).<BR>

<P>
Almost all the states of the world are members of Interpol. About
eighty police agents of different countries work at the headquarters
of the organisation in the French city of Lyon while in the national
capitals of the member countries the CNOs (Central National Offices)
operate with local police officers. These offices communicate
directly for information exchange. The central data bank in Lyon
receives and gives information and data. This is what Interpol
mainly does (See: Bresler,1993; Valleix, 1984).<BR>

<P>
So, police co-operation is not new but its growth in recent times
has been very great and, obviously, related to the escalation
of international crime. Regarding EU countries, judiciary and
police co-operation started in the 1970s to fight terrorism. Recent
acceleration of co-operation, by contrast, is linked to the upsurge
of drug-related crimes as well as to the control of immigration
and prevention of illegal immigration (Ahnfelt and From, 1993;
Benyon, 1994; Fijnaut, 1994).<BR>

<P>
On German initiative, the need for police co-operation in the
EU has been discussed since the beginning of the 197Os. (See:
Benyon, 1992; de Boer and Walker, 1992). The extent of political
terrorism experienced by several member states led to the creation
of TREVI Group. This intergovemmental forum of EC Ministries of
Justice and Home Affairs was established by the European Council
in 1975 to co-ordinate anti-terrorism measures. TREVI's organisational
structure had three co-ordinated levels: ministerial, top civil
servant and the working group level. The Presidency of TREVI followed
the Presidency of the EC. 
<P>
The working groups, composed of civil servants and police officers,
were responsible for preparatory work on matters to be discussed
at higher level meetings, as well as for carrying out research
and planning at the request of the politicians. In 1991 the Commission
and the Secretariat of the Council of Ministers were permitted
to participate as observers in the working group responsible for
preparatory work on the removal of border controls within the
Community. With the construction of the Third Pillar, TREVI structures
have been progressively converted into structures of the Pillar
(See: Adam, 1994).<BR>

<P>
Since November 1993 and the coming into force of the Maastricht
Treaty, the EU's Council of Interior and Justice Ministers has
co-ordinated a number of actions on the basis of Article K (Title
VI on &quot;Co-operation in the Fiuds of Justice and Home Affairs&quot;)
of the Maastricht Treaty (See: den Boer, 1995; Vilarino Pintos,
1994). Article K l. identifies nine areas as &quot;matters of
common interest&quot;: (1) asylum policy; (2) rules governing
the crossing by persons of the external borders of the Member
States and the exercise of controls thereon; (3) immigration policy
and policy regarding nationals of third countries; (4) combating
drug addiction in so far as this is not covered by (7) to (9);
(5) combating fraud on an international scale in so far as this
is not covered by (7) to (9); (6) judicial co-operation in civil
matters; (7) judicial co-operation in criminal matters; (8) customs
co-operation; (9) police co-operation for the purposes of preventing
and combating terrorism, unlawful drug trafficking and other serious
forms of international crime, including if necessary certain aspects
of customs co-operation, in connection with the organisation of
a Union-wide system for exchanging information within a European
Police Office (Europol). Like foreign and defence affairs, justice
and home affairs are sensitive matters of state sovereignty. They
involve the use of coercion, the restriction of liberties, and
the conditions of public and social order. The execution of Title
VI provisions hence is a particularly difficult task. The desired
harmonisation of different penal laws will be a slow and painstaking
task. In spite of this, the opinion of the experts is that results
have already been achieved in the first two years of existence
of the Third Pillar (Willy Bruggeman, 1996).
<P>
Article K.l.9. of the Maastricht Treaty provides for the establishment
of Europol. In June 1991 Germany put a formal proposal to the
delegates negotiating on the reform of the treaties. The proposal
was to establish a unit for combating terrorism and organised
crime through the exchange of information and also with an operational
mandate.<BR>

<P>
Europol is &quot;to improve the effectiveness and co-operation
of the competent authorities in the Member States in preventing
and combating terrorism, unlawful drug trafficking and other serious
forms of international crime where there are factual indications
that an organised criminal structure is involved and two or more
Member Stares are affected... &quot; (article K.1.). 
<P>
The supplementary Declaration appended to the Treaty also refers
to other instruments like support, analysis of national prevention
programmes, training and research and development. Finally, the
Europol Convention (signed in Brussels on July 26th) describes
Europol's tasks as: exchange of information; analysis; facilitating
the co-ordination of ongoing investigations; increasing expertise;
training.<BR>

<P>
Europol's tasks will be performed by Europol officials and analysts
on the one hand and by liaison officers from the Member States
on the other. Every country is obliged to set up a national intelligence
service (Europol National Unit).
<P>
However, Europol is not a completely new agency. On June 2, 1993,
a Ministerial Agreement set up the Europol Drugs Unit (EDU), which
started operation on January 1st, 1994. Its mandate has been extended
by the Joint Action of the Justice and Interior Ministers of March
10, 1995 from drugs-related crime only to illicit trafficking
in radioactive and nuclear substances, illicit vehicle trafficking,
clandestine immigration networks and all associated money-laundering
activities. EDU does not take charge of cases but provides assistance
and support. Each team of liaison officers remains under the exclusive
control of the national authorities and the management of EDU
co-ordinates the team, not the cases. According to Bruggeman (1996),
this provisional model will probably be one of the cornerstones
of Europol: &quot;nothing else is possible given that the Member
States' criminal justice and law enforcernent systems are based
entirely on the principle of sovereignty&quot;.<BR>

<H1>EU and US transatlantic partnership and internal security
<BR>
</H1>

<P>
Since the end of World War II, relations between Western Europe
and the United States have been the object of continuous debate
among politicians, diplomats, academics and concerned people.
The conflict of interests and the similarity/identity of the fundamental
values of the two parts have been repeatedly assessed during the
last fifty years. 
<P>
The importance, for the whole international system, of co-operative
relations between the two sides of the Atlantic and the aknowledged
reason for differentiation and even for conflict on certain issues
have always encouraged concern for studying the alliance and devising
a stable and enduring framework to overcome recurrent tensions.
Academics defined the nature of the relation using concepts like
hegemony and asymmetrical interdependence. Politicians, instead,
preferred to soften asperities by not sparing in the use of words
like partnership and friendship. Contrary to past attention and
concern and in spite of the convulsive state of change of the
present international system, debate is mostly &quot;soft&quot;
today. A larger opportunity for change goes with less debate on
steering the change of Atlantic co-operation. It is as if academics
and politicians feel themselves inadequately informed as to how
to interpret the evolution of affairs, and, above all, uncertain
on how to take good decisions to update and/or upgrade Atlantic
co-operation. But, not every thing is immobile.<BR>

<P>
In November 1990, in Paris the United States and the European
Community signed the Transatlantic Declaration and opened a new
set of diplomatic negotiations. The Declaration was not consonant
with the traditional nature of US-Europe relations, either in
terms of the nature of the signatory parts or of the content of
the document. One of two signatories was the government of the
United States but the other one was an uncommon diplomatic actor,
the tandem composed of the EC Presidency and the President of
the Commission. As for the content of the Declaration, it was
concerned with low political matters as much as with high and
sensitive issues, like trade and GATT. However, the public's attention
(even that of concerned people) rapidly fell off. The same lack
of public attention marked the annual summits of the signatory
which followed the Paris summit. Two years ago, one of the few
researchers attentive to the Declaration and the following transatlantic
negotiatons made this remark: &quot;politicians and academics
alike have apparently forgotten the so-called Transatlantic Declaration,
the major attempt to redefine the common relations and to build
up something like a stable network of relations&quot; (Wessels,
1993).<BR>

<P>
The reason for the constitution of the transatlantic network can
be found in the need to prevent the blossoming of reciprocal worries.
On the American side, the worry is that once EU governments reach
a common position, this is declared as final and not open to negotiation
with the United States. On the European side, the worry is that
the United States wants to it at the EU negotiation table and
dominate the debate. Indeed, in a situation of no conflict among
EU governements, these may confront the US government with a non-
negotiable position; in a situation of conflict among EU governments,
instead, the US government may easily interfere by its direct
relations with the single European governments. 
<P>
Therefore, the transatlantic network of negotiations may be the
way to avoid such a double negative situation and make more equal
- perhaps, in the future also deeper - links between EU and the
United States.<BR>

<P>
The annual transatlantic summits between the Presidents of the
European Council and Commission and the President of the United
States have been considered as a major step to establish a <I>communaut&eacute;
de vue</I> as a base for common activities. At the same time,
the frequent meetings of working groups have been considered valuable
instruments of &quot;confidence building&quot; among administrations
not used to work toghether. 
<P>
But, critics say, the annual meetings are too infrequent to create
the projected <I>communaut&eacute; de vue</I> and the working
groups are inconclusive experiences for administrators used to
work with very different practices and styles. As a matter of
fact, the US side has to get accustomed to EU practices, like,
for instance the rotation of the Presidency. EU diplomats, in
their turn, have to work hard to get at effective co-ordination
of national positions and, when this is impossibile, to reduce
the effect of failed co-ordination in order to appropriately confront
their American counterpart.<BR>

<P>
In spite of complaints, the transatlantic network has not been
dismantled. On the contrary, by agreeing on the New Transatlantic
Agenda (signed in Madrid on December 15-16, 1995), the two parts
considered the present structure of co-operation as fitting well
to the state of EU-US relations. The Agenda presents four major
goals of co-operation (promoting peace, stability, democracy and
development around the world; responding to global challenges;
contributing to the expansion of world trade and closer economic
relations; building bridges across the Atlantic) and issues a
Joint EU/US Action Plan. It is difficult to say whether the Agenda
is a real incremental step, a simple updated version or a mere
repetition of the 1990 Declaration. Undoubtedly, the implementation
of the Action Plan will be the litmus test of the importance of
the Agenda and viability of the transatlantic network. The actions
to be taken are not easy, but the seriousness of the issues linked
to the first and second world change is certainly a strong incentive
to move in the direction devised in the Agenda.<BR>

<P>
Co-operation in the field of internal security is a major topic
of the Action Plan. It extensively defines the problem of international
crime prevention and containment, differentiates many aspects
of crime at the global level, and openly considers the case for
police co-operation.<BR>

<P>
The new dimensions of security - explicitly reported as products
of the globalisation process - are the very object of the Joint
EU/US Action Plan. The concluding part of the Agenda merits full
quotation. Governments confess their <TT>concern to address in
an effective manner new global challenges which, without respect
for national boundaries, present a serious threat to the quality
of life and which no one state can overcome alone. They list the
following global issues: international crime, terrorism and drug
trafficking, mass migration, degradation of the environment, nuclear
safety and disease. <BR>
</TT>
<P>
<TT>A series of bilateral co-operation and institutional contacts
are envisaged to fight against illegal drug trafficking, money
laundering, terrorism, organised crime and illicit trade in nuclear
materials. They are the enhancement of the capabilities of criminal
justice and investigative systems, the promotion of the rule of
law through international training programmes at regional institutions,
the establishment of an information exchange mechanism on co-operation
between the U.S. and the EU and member states in the law enforcement
and criminal justice fields, the exchange of law enforcement and
criminal justice. The possibility of establishing interim co-operative
measures between competent U.S. authorities and the European Drugs
Unit, the execution of the measures contemplated in the convention
on EUROPOL to facilitate relations between EUROPOL and the U.S.
Government are proposed, as well as co-operation in the framework
of the UN Drug Control Programme. To counter drug production,
the establishment of co-operative links between EU institutions
such as the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction
and the Commission Interamericana para el Control del Abuso de
Drogas are also proposed. <BR>
</TT>
<P>
<TT>Illegal immigration, traffic in illegal immigrants and the
traffic in women are further areas of public security co-operation
signalled in the Action Plan. Legal and judicial international
co-operation is also pledged as the dena for future common action.
<BR>
</TT>
<H1>The Barcelona Declaration and the Mediterranean theatre of
internal security<BR>
</H1>

<P>
At the very time the two world changes matured and the Atlantic
countries started the transatlantic network, the EU and its member
governments began to reconsider the state of another sector of
their international relations. The political and economic instability
of East European countries after the dissolution of communism
was not more serious than the condition of the neghbouring countries
in the Mediterranean region. It took some years to pass from the
awareness of the problem to the formulation of a policy, from
realising the unproductiveness of past programmes and actions
towards the Mediterranean countries, to putting on the ground
a new strategy aimed at substituting the traditional sectorial
and bilateral approach with the Euro-Meditarrean Partnership (See:
Joffe 1994; Pace 1995). The Barcelona conference - where the Partnership
has been solemnly launched - may be the opening of a new chapter
in the history of relations between the European Union and the
countries of the Mediterranean.<BR>

<P>
The United States has not been admitted as a full participant
state but assisted to the official parts of the conference. The
European Union and its member governments, with different positions,
excluded them for formal reasons. The United States is not a Mediterranean
country. However, invitation has been discussed and the exclusion
may be taken as an indication of the persistence of the &quot;dissociation
syndrome&quot;.
<P>
To take the United States as much as possible out of the restructuring
of the Mediterranean region while the restructuring of international
politics is in progress, was a delicatetask. However, the European
Union and its governments talked with the rest of the Mediterranean
governments on important political, security and economic matters
without the presence of the Washington government and made future
plans in all those matters.<BR>

<P>
The Declaration targets a free trade area among the 27 participants
by the year 2010 and pledges to start co-operation in a broad
range of political, social and economic fields. It comprises four
chapters (Political and Security Partnership; Economic and Financial
Partnership; Partnership in Social, Cultural and Human Affairs;
Follow-Up) and a work programme.<BR>

<P>
In the chapter on Political and Security Partnership the participants
stress their conviction that peace, stability and security in
the Mediterranean region are common assets which they pledge to
promote and strengthen &quot;by all means at their disposal&quot;.
It is in this chapter that they undertake to, among other things,
<BR>

<UL>
<LI>strengthen their co-operation in preventing and combating
terrorism, in particular by ratifying and applying the international
instruments they have signed, by acceding to such instruments
and by taking any other appropriate measure; 
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>fight together against the expansion and diversification of
organised crime and combat the drugs problem in all its aspects.

</UL>

<P>
In the chapter on Economic and Financial Partnership, the participating
countries fixed three long term objectives to their partnership:
to speed up the pace of lasting social and economic development;
to improve living conditions by increasing employment and closing
the development gap in the Euro-Mediterranean region; to promote
co-operation and regional integration.<BR>

<P>
In the chapter on Partnership in Social, Cultural and Human Affairs,
governments recognise that mutual understanding can be greatly
enhanced by human exchanges and dialogue between cultures. 
<P>
The conference agreed to establish a wide range of co-operation
between peoples, not only in politics but also in culture, religion,
education, the media, as well as between trade unions and public
and private companies. The Declaration also recognises the challenges
posed by current population trends in the Med12 (non-EU countries)
and says that they must be counterbalanced by &quot;appropriate
policies to accelerate economic take-off&quot;. Participants agreed
to strengthen their co-operation to reduce migratory pressures
and illegal immigration. They also acknowledged the principle
that source countries had &quot;a responsibility for readmission&quot;
of illegal immigrants to Europe. In this chapter again they pledge
to act against crime:<BR>

<UL>
<LI>they agree to strengthen co-operation by means of various
measures to prevent terrorism and fight it more effectively together;

</UL>

<UL>
<LI>by the same token they consider it necessary to fight jointly
and effectively against drug trafficking, international crime
and corruption. 
</UL>

<P>
Like the Helsinki Conference, the Barcelona Conference provides
for Follow-Up. Foreign Ministers from the 27 nations will meet
periodically to review progress in implementing the Declaration
and to agree on actions which will achieve its objectives. Their
first meeting will be in the first half of 1997 in a Mediterranean
member state of the Union. Sectorial meetings at ministerial level
will be organised together with <I>ad hoc</I> conferences.<BR>

<P>
To translate the Barcelona Declaration into concrete action, the
Conference approved a Work ProgrammeThis Programme encourages
initiatives to discuss migratory flows and co-operation between
law and order authorities as part of the fight against terrorism,
drug trafficking, organised crime and illegal immigration.<BR>

<H1>Conclusion<BR>
</H1>

<P>
The European Union is at the cross-roads of the Transatlantic
and the Mediterranean co-operation and is, at the same time, attempting
to formulate its own joint actions and common policies. The United
States is committed to reshaping its hegemonic foreign policy
but has to take into account contradictory trends: on the one
hand, the continuing need for the presence of an actor as the
provider of last resort of important collective goods of the system;
on the other hand, the challenges put to it by the aspirations
to greater autonomy of old and new actors of the global system.
The Med12 are both anxious to prevent the explosion of many crisis
factors in their societies and conscious, almost unanimously,
of the need for international co-operation to approach the condition
of take off. <BR>

<P>
In such a contingency, the fact that the objects of co-operation
in the European Union, Transatlatinc relations and the Euro-Meditarranean
region are the same, though not particularly astonishing to professional
observers of international politics, is a fact that merits attentive
consideration. The longer the governments go on with the implementation
of the Action Plan and Work Programme of such co-operation, the
stronger will be the change of the international system in the
direction of improving security in different dimensions.<BR>

<P>
Today, the Mediterranean region is characterised by a multitude
of problems and challenges. They include wide socio-economic disparities
among the coastal states, migratory pressure, environmental degradation,
political instability and the expansion of various forms of extremism,
in addition to other sources of tension such as ethnic and minority
issues, boundary disputes, conflict over resources and arms proliferation.
<BR>

<P>
On the southern shores of the Mediterranean in particular, the
consequences of economic problems and population explosion contribute
to exacerbate an already difficult socio-political situation.
In part, this is the result of the disequilibrium between the
levels of development on the northern and southern shores of the
Mediterranean. Socio-economic tensions and potentially unstable
political systems affect the domestic situation in many countries
of the southern shore, fuelling migration towards Europe and forming
a fertile ground for the development of religious extremism. In
addition to that, the concentration of military arsenals in the
area remains at alarming levels because of a preoccupation with
declared and potential conflicts.<BR>

<P>
Within this degree of diversity of risks and challenges, there
is a clear interrelation in security terms among the countries
of the region, deriving mainly from their growing interdependence.
This interrelation suggests the need for a cooperative approach
to security. Indeed, only co-operation will make it possible to
tackle and solve the problems of security and latent instability
in the Mediterranean.<BR>

<P>
Actually, attempts at generating a dialogue on issues of direct
interest to the countries in the region have a fairly long history
dating back to the early 1970s. The immediate cause for their
ineffectiveness is to be found in the conditions prevailing at
the time of the East-West confrontation. The end of the Cold War
and the breakthroughs in the Middle East peace process have lifted
many of the constraints on regional co-operation in the Mediterranean.
Indeed, many comprehensive or partial co-operation initiatives
have seen the light of the day since the collapse of the Berlin
Wall. <BR>

<P>
Among the initiatives aimed at establishing a regional co-operation
framework the EU-sponsored Euro-Mediterranean Partnership deserves
special mention. In June 1994, at their meeting in Corfu, the
Heads of Government of the European Union asked the EU Commission
to provide an evaluation of the existing Euro-Mediterranean policy
and to make proposals for strengthening it. The Commission responded
to this request with a document which proposed the creation of
a regional partnership and led to endorsement at the European
Council in Essen in December 1994 of a new approach to relations
with the Mediterranean countries. On 27-28 November 1995, the
fifteen EU member countries and twelve Mediterranean states (Morocco,
Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt, Israel, Palestine, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria,
Turkey, Cyprus and Malta) met in Barcelona and approved a blueprint
for an ambitious Euro-Mediterranean Partnership aimed at fostering
free-trade and closer co-operation in the region. The Partnership
embraces politics and security, economic and financial development,
and social, cultural and human affairs.<BR>

<P>
To examine current security trends and prospects for co-operation
in the Mediterranean in the wake of the Barcelona Conference,
the Mediterranean Academy of Diplomatic Studies, University of
Malta, organized a two-day Colloquium on &quot;Co-operation and
Security in the Mediterranean: Prospects after Barcelona&quot;,
on 22-23 March 1996, in Malta. <BR>

<P>
The Colloquium sought to promote a constructive exchange of views
on issues of security, stability and co-operation in the Mediterranean
following the establishment of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership.
It brought together over thirty experts from the Mediterranean
region, Europe and the United States, representing governments,
international organizations, foreign policy institutes and the
academic community. A number of these individuals made presentations
at the Colloquium and their papers are included in this volume.
<BR>

<P>
The papers collected in Part One and Part Two discuss the outcome
of the Barcelona Conference as seen from the Northern and Southern
rim of the Mediterranean respectively. Part Three examines various
aspects of Mediterranean security and co-operation. Although contributors'
opinions may diverge on specific political, economic or socio-cultural
issues, a consensus seems to emerge on the importance of the process
started in Barcelona as a milestone in the relations between Europe
and its Mediterranean neighbours. <BR>

<P>
It is hoped that the papers contained in this volume will contribute
to a better informed debate on the multiplicity of issues and
challenges confronting the Mediterranean on the eve of the 21<SUP>st</SUP>
century. <BR>

<P>
<B>I. Introduction<BR>
</B>
<P>
While populations around the shores of the Mediterranean are bound
together by shared historical experience, cultural exchanges and
trade, there are still some striking differences at an economic
level. On the northern shores Italy, France and Spain have a fundamental
role in setting the EU's Mediterranean agenda whilst smaller countries
like Portugal and Greece reflect the challenges and constraints
confronting peripheral but relatively developed regions in southern
Europe. On the southern shores of the Mediterranean, there are
countries which, confronting severe socio-economic problems, experience
the rise of fundamentalism.<BR>

<P>
However, even within the poorer regions of the Mediterranean region,
certain differences subsist. Attempts towards regionalism have
not been markedly successful (a case in point being the Union
of the Arab Maghreb (UMA)) largely due to divergent socio-economic
policies and lack of economic complementarity among the members
as well as political instability. Turkey and Egypt have a combined
population of over 100&nbsp;million, with population growth rising
at around 2.5 per cent per annum. Demographic problems are expected
to create further socio-economic pressures within the region.
On the other hand, Malta, Cyprus and Israel are countries which
have registered exceptional economic growth, compared to the rest
of the Mediterranean non-member countries (MNC) and also to the
northern Mediterranean EU members. <B>II. Priority economic areas
<BR>
</B>
<P>
The main economic areas for the co-operation in the Mediterranean
region in the aftermath of Barcelona (November 1995) may be summarised
s follows :<BR>

<OL>
<LI>Energy, Water, Telecommunications, Transport infrastructure
<LI>Household Food Security, Agriculture and Agro-Industry
<OL>
<LI>Industrial Development, with special reference to micro-enterprises
and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and technology creation
<LI>Trade and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and the Globalisation
Process 
</OL>

<LI>Environment
<LI>Tourism 
</OL>

<P>
The above list, which is not presented in order of priority, must
be considered in its socio-political context, with particular
reference to the observance of human rights and to the problem
of immigration from the southern to the northern shores. I shall
now comment on each problem area <BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>1. Energy, Telecommunications and Transport Infrastructure
<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
Investment in infrastructure, especially in water production and
management, in energy and in transport, is a pre-condition for
business investment and a contributor to economic growth, employment
creation and international competitiveness. A large proportion
of the Structural and Cohesion funds in Southern Europe has been
channeled into infrastructural projects. The European Investment
Bank (EIB) has been very active in strengthening the infrastructure
across the Mediterranean countries. Further public investment
is however required in sewage works, waste disposal, telecommunications,
water supplies and energy and road transport.
<P>
Better infrastructure, especially within the rural areas, plays
a crucial role in alleviating poverty. A strengthened road transport
network enables marketing of agricultural products and easy access
to health, education and other services, particularly within peripheral
areas in countries like Algeria, Egypt, and Turkey. There also
needs to be adequate maintenance of road systems, hence necessitating
investments in specialised human resources and equipment. Environmental
infrastructure should also be placed high on the policy agenda
in the Mediterranean region, including measures to achieve better
energy efficiency and promote clean alternative energy sources
(wind or solar).<BR>

<P>
The water crisis is endemic in most southern Mediterranean countries
and islands and is increasingly affecting northern Mediterranean
countries, including France, Spain, Italy and Greece. Demand is
increasing for agricultural, residential and industrial purposes
and thus one of the main challenges confronting all Mediterranean
countries is to design strategies for water reuse and production.
Further investments are required in sewage treatment and desalination
plants. Furthermore there should be sustained efforts towards
monitoring water supply. The need becomes imperative given the
effects of global warming and consequent climatic change.<BR>

<P>
Infrastructure still remains the domain of the public sector and
is expected to remain such in this region. The proposed Mediterranean
Corporation for Industrial Development (see section 3) should
identify other sources of funding to upgrade the infrastructure
in some Mediterranean countries.<BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>2. Household Food Security, Agriculture and Agro-Industry
<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
Agriculture and agro-industry constitute one of the most important
economic areas on both northern and southern shores of the Mediterranean.
Although its share in gross domestic product has fallen in most
countries over the past years, the sector remains one of the main
employers. In several southern Mediterranean countries, a food
subsidy system has been in place to protect household food security,
although budgetary constraints have tended to reduce the coverage
and cost of the subsided products. Malnutrition is not as severe
as in most Sub-Saharan countries but there are vulnerable groups,
especially babies, young children, young mothers and old persons,
who suffer from basic nutritional deficiencies.<BR>

<P>
The priorities in this field are the introduction of appropriate
marketing, pricing, tax and exchange rate policies; investment
in rural infrastructure, health and sanitation and education facilities.
Although these issues fall internationally within the mandate
of the World Bank International Monetary Fund and the Food and
Agriculture Organisation (FAO), yet their economic impact suggests
that there should be more policy-oriented agricultural research
in the region with continuous monitoring of the effects of the
structural adjustment process on household food security, including
the design of measures which need to be introduced at an early
stage to minimise any adverse effects that such a process could
generate.<BR>

<P>
The Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research
(CGIAR) plays an important role within the applied research context,
especially through IFPRI (International Food Policy Research Institute)
based in the United States and ICARDA (Syria). however, there
is scope for a more regionally-focused initiative concerning food
security and nutrition in the Mediterranean region. A Centre could
be set up under the general direction of the specialised research
institute ICAMAS (International Centre for Advanced Mediterranean
Agronomic Studies) based in Paris and with the support of the
EU and FAO, to compile a database which gathers information on
current food demand, forecasts and nutritional status at a micro
level through longitudinal studies using national food and nutrition
surveys. Such studies must be launched at a regional level. The
Centre would liaise with the different National Food and Nutrition
Centres, monitoring the health and diet status of the target populations
and offering recommendations to national and international organisations.
<BR>

<P>
Moreover, the future of agriculture and agro-industry in the southern
Mediterranean countries and of the workers dependent on this industry
lies in the expansion and diversification of trade, upgrading
of product quality, and increasing off-farm employment opportunities.
There is also the need for greater investment in food storage
facilities and new agricultural technologies, in particular drip-irrigation
techniques, and small and medium-scale irrigation schemes. In
the case of some countries/regions, there is the potential to
link agriculture and tourism activities or agriculture and craft
industries. 
<P>
There needs to be a clear commitment by all Governments within
the Mediterranean to liberalise regional trade, especially within
the agriculture and agro-industrial sector, and to support the
creation of new micro-enterprises or small industrial activities
which supply larger units (on a sub-contracting basis or through
the industrial districts concept, which has operated so efficiently
in some regions in Italy). Finally, agricultural co-operatives
at both production and marketing levels should also be supported.
<BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>3. Industrial Development, Small and Medium-Sized
Enterprises (SMEs) and Technology Creation<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
Industrial development in MNCs is rather unbalanced and of a dualistic
nature. The role of the state has also been traditionally extremely
predominant in the productive activities of the economy in most
southern Mediterranean countries. Thus the main challenges confronting
most countries is a diversification process, away from apredominance
of sectors based on cheap labour costs (textiles and wearing apparels)
and the exploitation of natural resources or agricultural raw
materials to the identification of new market niches and the promotion
of the quality concept in industry. Within this context, it is
important to set in place systems of standards, certification
bodies and testing and calibration laboratories. New export opportunities
depend on the ability to diversify the range of goods offered,
product differentiation and specialisation in high-quality products.
Another priority is to support micro-enterprises and SMEs in their
export marketing strategies through regional trade liberalisation,
stimulating and nurturing entrepreneurs.<BR>

<P>
There also needs to be a socio-economic context conducive to growth,
especially through the encouragement of market mechanisms and
through favouring social factors (education), and political stability
to foster technology creation, rather than traditional and conventional
technology transfer as such. 
<P>
The success of this new technology policy is largely dependent
on how adaptable local factors of production are to changing technological
requirements, the two fundamental pre-requisites being improved
manpower training and the strengthening of the basic infrastructure.
Two areas of potential development in the Mediterranean area are
irrigation schemes and marine industrial technology.<BR>

<P>
Marine technology is an area which indicates a tremendous technological
gap between the northern and southern shores of the Mediterranean.
In this context a Mediterranean Centre for Research and Development
in Marine Industrial Technology would not only reduce such a gap
but could also identify specific needs (for example, water production)
and develop, on the Eureka <I>partenariat </I>model, suitable
technology (for example, solar desalination) to fill those needs.
<BR>

<P>
It is also recommended that a Mediterranean Corporation for Industrial
Development be established, one that could be modelled on the
existing Centre for Industrial Development (CID) between ACP countries
and the EU under the Lom&eacute; Convention and will be mainly
concerned with SME development. The main difference between the
existing CID and the proposed Mediterranean entity is that it
would not only act as a support service but would also be a financial
institution on the same lines as the World Bank's affiliate -
the International Finance Corporation. Thus, the Corporation would
provide finance and investment expertise and raise funds from
international markets, tapping venture capital. A necessary pre-requisite,
of course, would be the development of efficient financial networks,
a strengthened legal and accounting system and the emergence of
a sense of entrepreneurism.<BR>

<P>
The role of the Corporation would encompass all existing programmes
- BC-Net, BRE, Med-Invest and European Community Investment Partners
(ECIP) - and further strengthen the support services component
to development agencies, chambers of commerce, federation of industries
and individual firms within MNCs. this would hence include the
evaluation of initial requests for project proposals, partner
search, feasibility studies, diagnostic studies about structural
changes within different industrial sectors, the design of industrial
strategies, training, export marketing, assistance in technology
creation and promoting deregulation and privatisation initiatives.
<BR>

<P>
These services will be targeted to SMEs and micro-enterprises
since, as the experience of industrialised countries has shown,
they have a vital role to play in resolving the problems of structural
unemployment and weak economic growth. Although micro-enterprises
normally engage less than 10 employees, they operate across various
activities, including agriculture, handicrafts, trading, services
and manufacturing. They are flexible and adaptable and operate
within that informal sector which, especially in the southern
and eastern Mediterranean, has enjoyed a long tradition.<BR>

<P>
The proposed Corporation could support these firms through subsidiaries
or new specialised institutions (modeled, for example, on the
Grameen Bank in Bangladesh) in the areas of easier access to credit
vocational training and training in financial and business management
techniques, which should particularly enable the activation of
agricultural investment in certain remote rural areas. Such forms
of economic activity create new employment opportunities, contribute
to improved, more equitable living standards through broader and
more even income distribution patterns, support women's activities
and strengthen horizontal and vertical linkages throughout the
economy thus engendering a more integrated and resilient economic
base for more balanced economic expansion. The role of non-Governmental
Organisations (NGOs) is also very important in this context. Furthermore
it is imperative to bear in mind that it is not solely the quantum
of the financial support which is relevant but its planning, management
and co-ordination between Government and private organisations
and NGOs.<BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>4. Trade, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and
the Regionalism-Globalisation Process<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
Future Euro-Mediterranean trade relations will culminate in a
free trade area by the year 2010 up new market opportunities to
southern Mediterranean countries. It is still premature to ascertain
the potential magnitude and direction of the trade creation and
trade diversion effects of the proposed Euro-Mediterranean Partnership
but further market liberalisation can be part of the solution
to the bleak economic situation of many MNCs. In 1992, the trade
balance with the EU was only positive for Algeria, Cyprus and
Syria whilst Israel, Turkey, Lebanon, Tunisia and Egypt each registered
a deficit exceeding 1 billion ecus. With further trade liberalisation,
both under the new Partnership and the World Trade Organisation,
the EU is expected to gradually dismantle several of its existing
trade barriers. It is expected that MNCs will benefit from new
opportunities, particularly on the FDI front.<BR>

<P>
The proposed Corporation would also provide a Foreign Investment
Advisory Service to assist governments in the Mediterranean region
to obtain increased flows of FDI and introduce the necessary laws,
policies, regulations and procedures. FDI requires domestic political
stability, sound economic policies and a minimum of restrictions
on commercial and market forces, thus ushering in capital, management
expertise and technology, given the appropriate infrastructure
in terms of policies and institutions. To this effect, it is important
that the effectiveness of various schemes, such as investment
guarantee schemes, incentives, including fiscal ones, for joint
ventures are evaluated on a country-specific basis. The countries
which seem to have the potential to attract important flows of
FDI due to their strategic position, economic and political stability
and market-based laws and regulations are Malta, Cyprus, Turkey
and Israel. Most of the Maghreb-Mashreq region, with the exception
of Tunisia and to a lesser extent Morocco still suffer from political-economic
problems which have to be addressed prior to the constant inflow
of FDI.<BR>

<P>
Although regionalism is constantly, and rightly, advocated empirically
in a pan-Mediterranean context, yet world trade and investment
is increasingly dominated by global strategies and the dominant
role of multinational corporations. Inter-industry trade, reflecting
large differences in relative factor endowments between two groups
of countries (for example northern Mediterranean and southern
Mediterranean) may increase over the coming decades although this
form of international trade would be &quot;crowded out&quot; by
EU-Central and Eastern Europe trade relations. <B><FONT SIZE=2>5.
Environment<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
The Mediterranean region has one of the most fragile environments
at a world-wide level. The potential problems are compounded given
the rising population pressures and competing land and water uses
within relatively limited areas. Environmental issues should be
tackled at a regional or international level given that the problems
have a cross-border dimension. Urgent measures are necessary in
the areas of coastal resource management, tourism development,
agriculture, fisheries and aquaculture and protection of natural
and historic sites. Whilst the recently-created Mediterranean
Commission for Sustainable Development through the UN Mediterranean
Action Plan (MAP) (whose juridical framework is the Barcelona
Convention (1976)) is undoubtedly welcome, it is imperative to
set in place the necessary regulatory and economic instruments.
Environmental policy needs to be fully integrated with other policies.
Within this context, for example, it is high time that tourism
and environmental policy are integrated.<BR>

<P>
There needs to be a regulatory body which oversees the implementation
of existing laws and regulations, including economic instruments
like pollution charges, user charges, resource pricing and fines/fees.
The Commission should also operate a Mediterranean Environmental
Facility (similar to the Global Environmental Facility) to protect
biodiversity in the Mediterranean area and the Mediterranean sea.
Eventually, the Mediterranean Commission for Sustainable Development
could also develop a role as a Mediterranean Environmental Authority.
<BR>

<P>
Finally, attempts should be made to quantify any form of environmental
degradation within the region and account for it within the national
accounting framework, strengthening that regional environmental
information system which, for example the Observatoire Mediterraneen
of the Blue Plan (part of the UN Mediterranean Action Plan) is
operating. A pilot exercise should be launched to quantify the
impact of Mediterranean tourism on the economies and natural environments
of all Mediterranean countries and could eventually be extended
to other sectors - agriculture, industry, energy and transport,
thus introducing green accounting within each Mediterranean country.
<BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>6. Tourism<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
Sustainable tourism development in the region is a priority area.
The proposed creation (by Malta) of a Mediterranean Travel Commission,
modelled on the European Travel Commission, is timely given the
recent Agreement by Mediterranean States to expand the scope of
the Barcelona Convention in monitoring littoral development.<BR>

<P>
It is proposed that from an early stage a close working relationship
be established between the Mediterranean Corporation for Industrial
Development and the Mediterranean Commission for Sustainable Development.

<P>
The setting up of the necessary institutional framework to monitor
the effects of further industrial and tourism development in the
coastal areas across the Mediterranean region becomes of major
importance.<BR>

<P>
<B>III. The challenge<BR>
</B>
<P>
The public and private sectors in each of the countries bordering
the Mediterranean have important challenges for the coming years
to introduce the necessary regulatory measures and create the
right business environment for balanced economic growth and the
promotion of private initiative. Protecting the environment and
integrating environmental policy into industrial, energy, agricultural
and tourism policy should also feature as a priority on the policy
agenda. Four main Centres which would promote and monitor sustainable
economic development in the Mediterranean region are: <BR>

<OL>
<LI>an Agriculture, Food and Nutrition Research Centre; 
</OL>

<P>
(2) a Mediterranean Centre for Research and Development in Marine
Industrial Technology;<BR>

<P>
(3) a Mediterranean Corporation for Industrial Development with
special emphasis on micro-enterprises and SMEs;<BR>

<P>
(4) a Mediterranean Travel Commission.<BR>

<P>
The Mediterranean Commission for Sustainable Tourism can already
provide an important catalyst for most of these proposals and
could, through the legal framework of the Barcelona Convention,
offer a basic institutional structure for consolidation and further
expansion. With the mobilisation of the necessary financial and
political support from all countries in the region it is possible
to tap the necessary human and financial resources so that these
institutions are set up by the end of this decade equipping the
Mediterranean region to better meet the challenges of the next
Millenium.<BR>

<P>
The challenge, then, is to avert those seeds of danger which,
taking root in economic soil, can sprout social and political
pressures, their tentacles menacing military security. More importantly,
the 'new' security of the Mediterranean should be one that guarantees
the application of basic human rights, without whose observance
there can be no stability, military or otherwise.<BR>

<P>
Indeed, economic insecurity may unfold in the Mediterranean, in
a neo-colonialist scenario where hegemony is fomented and exercised
through economic and financial instruments.
<P>
The marked reluctance, for example, of the more advanced European
states to support a Mediterranean development bank has less to
do with the avowed abundance of venture capital than with greed
and the creed of favouring bilateral, rather than multilateral
co-operation, the former allowing that master-client relationship
whose raison d'etre is not, now, the supply of armaments but the
channeling of foreign investment; and this, in such a form and
with such design as to perpetuate a vassal dependence more thrilling
and binding than ever offered by arms.<BR>

<P>
Cicero would today declaim <I>cedant arma economiae</I>, not <I>togae</I>!
<BR>

<P>
That form and design is expressed in a number of ways, such as
the terms of loans and grants, the former in crippling national
debts, the latter, more subtly, in conditions that so regulate
the grant as to compel the client-state to engage the master's
consultants, accept their project and buy the required technology
from the master. More nefariously, the relationship is sometimes
one where the client-state is de facto forced to introduce in
its territory relatively obsolescent and polluting processes.
<BR>

<P>
In rather paternalistic overtures, Barcelona (November 1995) encouraged
southern Mediterranean states to seek private investment, eschew
public ownership and generally to promote market economies in
the belief that the great magic wand of prosperity could only
be waved by capitalism, oblivious to the socio-political structure
of many of these states where the private sector, in so far as
it exists, is often the oligarchic preserve of a closed and restraining
nomenclature. <BR>

<P>
It is important that the north concretely help the south to promote
the private sector, not limiting itself to declamatory rhetoric.
Tourism, too, itself a useful source of foreign exchange and employment
generation for the southern Mediterranean , tends to be manipulated
by a handful of major Western tour operators more bent on a culture
of swift returns rather than that of a tourism based on the enjoyment
of that symbolic and natural heritage which the Mediterranean
has so uniquely assembled for the huddling 'northern' masses.
There, too, the hegemony spreads, the southern states being at
the mercy of the north for the direction and quality of a tourism
they have to 'welcome', at a price which has not only ecological
costs but also deep socio-cultural scars.
<P>
For we witness in fact not the adaptation of the tourist to his
vacation land; but the attempt to 'dress' the authentic south
in the fashion of the northern costume, accentuating that social
change which the western mass media already export to an 'entertainment'
hungry south.<BR>

<P>
It is the 'western' style of life of the north, in its tempting
allure to a youth seeking 'liberation' from the perceived fetters
of inhibiting traditions, that, by the implied superiority of
the economic and political regimes in which it flourishes, abets
the new imperialism enforced by socio-political models.<BR>

<P>
In conclusion, then, one must caution against the notion that
cultural tourism is an altogether socially positive value, or
a necessarily economically productive process. It must be planned
and managed in the socio-economic and socio-cultural setting of
the Mediterranean world and adapted to the traditions and styles
of the different receiving countries in the region. The cost-benefit
result of the exercise should ultimately be, in both economic
and social terms, a plus for those countries; but those responsible
for the promotion and direction of the industry must bear in mind
that at stake are human resources whose management must be inspired
beyond Mammon.<BR>

<P>
<B>THE EURO-MEDITERRANEAN PARTNERSHIP AFTER BARCELONA <BR>
<BR>
</B>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Jean Pierre DERISBOURG</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>,
Advisor to the Director General, DGIB, Directorate General for
External Relations, EU Commission, Brussels</FONT>
<HR>

<P>
After decades of bilateral relations with Mediterranean countries,
the EU decided, during the last European Summits, in Corfu (June
1994), in Essen (December 94), in Cannes (June 95), to propose
a real partnership to our southern neighbours.<BR>

<P>
The main reasons were: <BR>

<OL>
<LI>after the collapse of the USSR, the EU was attracted to the
east, with the possibilities of accession for central European
countries and the Baltic states.
<LI>The Commission and Member states wanted a fair balance in
favour of our neighbours of the south shore who cannot accede
to the EU; 
<LI>the regionalisation within the globalisation of the world
economy is a clear trend: Nafta in North America, with a possible
extension to South America; Mercosur between four Latin-American
countries; Asean and, possibly APEC, in Asia. The new rules of
WTO imply that the EU will have to review its network of bilateral
agreements with the Mediterranean neighbours; 
<LI>the need to address a new set of threat perceptions. There
is of course no longer a danger of military aggression and less
risk of interrupting the oil supplies through the Mediterranean.
Yet the European public opinion fears in the 1990's; 
<LI>a swap over of local or regional turmoil like in Algeria,
Palestine, Kurdistan or Egypt, into terrorism, insecurity, criminality
in Europe linked directly or indirectly to fundamentalists (from
any region); 
<LI>a security risk to European tourists and businessmen visiting
the Mediterranean;
<LI>a more and more uncontrollable flow of migration, asylum seekers,
job seekers, or people who are looking for better political, social
and economic conditions than in their home countries; 
<LI>an uncontrollable flow of drugs, whether hashish, cocaine
or opium derivatives;
<LI>the ongoing and recent proliferation of chemical, bacteriological
or even nuclear weapons in the Middle East. 
</OL>

<P>
The old threat perceptions, military conflict or oil embargo,
diminished, but these new threats are now increasing and helping
the extreme right political parties in Europe.<BR>

<P>
What are the possible answers to this situation? There was a wide
consensus in Barcelona on the need to stabilise the socio economic
situation in Europe's neighbourhood in the southern Mediterranean
shores with two objectives, peace and stability on one hand and
an important brake to emigration on the other hand. Reducing the
&quot;prosperity gap&quot; has become one of the key targets of
European policy. The prosperity gap is actually 1 to 12 according
to the World Bank and could well widen to 1 to 15 for the decade
1995-2005.<BR>

<P>
The main characteristics and philosophy of this new partnership
are: <BR>

<OL>
<LI>a non-paternalistic relationship based on the acknowledgement
of interdependencies and common interests, of the right to development
and freedom, the need for decentralised co-operation, the key
role of the private sector, continuous dialogue at all levels:
intergovernmental and between civil societies; 
</OL>

<OL>
<LI>a multidimensional co-operation in its action and its instruments.

</OL>

<P>
How will it work after Barcelona? The work programme adopted is
divided in three baskets:<BR>

<P>
1. Political and security partnership: establishing a common area
of peace and stability<BR>

<P>
Senior officials, meeting already next week in Brussels, will
conduct a political dialogue to examine the most appropriate means
and methods of implementing the principles adopted in Barcelona.
Most probably they will start to work, with pragmatism, on a possible
list of confidence building measures, to be submitted at the next
Euro-Mediterranean meeting of Ministers for foreign affairs. Tunisia
and Morocco are both candidates to host such a conference in Spring
1997. <BR>

<P>
In parallel, foreign policy institutes in the region are encouraged
to establish a network for more intensive co-operation. This present
colloquium constitutes one step in the right direction.<BR>

<P>
2. Establishment of a Euro-Mediterranean free trade area<BR>

<P>
Whoever wants to transform the Mediterranean into a zone of peace
and stability, should focus attention on how to improve the socio-economic
situation in each of the countries concerned.
<P>
The negotiation of Association agreements, with each of the countries,
is expected to act as a powerful catalyst for opening the economies,
introducing free market systems and necessary legislative reforms.
This should give a spur to economic development, private investment,
job creation, less corruption, more transparency and accountability,
and contribute to the easing of social tensions within societies.
<BR>

<P>
Association agreements have already been negotiated and signed
with Tunisia, Israel and Morocco. Negotiations are going on with
Egypt and will start soon with Jordan and Lebanon. Explanatory
talks have started with the Algerians, the Palestinians and the
Syrians.<BR>

<P>
Bilateral agreements with the EU are not enough. We want the Mediterranean
partners to step up their co-operation with their neighbours.
They should be heading for a Euro-Mediterranean free trade area,
around 2010, similar to EFTA at the start. A network of agreements
is necessary for this purpose: Turkey, Israel, Cyprus, Tunisia
are already in discussions to establish such new relations. It
will be a long march, with a lot of difficulties, no doubt, but
this is the only way to build a real economic and political partnership.
The EU decided, in Cannes, on a major financial contribution to
sustain modernisation efforts: doubling the transfer of funds,
roughly grants of 1 bn Ecu each year until 1999 and the same amount,
or more, in loans from the EIB. Horizontal and decentralised policies
will continue in certain areas: environment, private sector development,
regional integration efforts by improving, before end 1996, instruments
like Med Invest, Med Campus, Med Urbs, Med Maedia, Med Migration.
<BR>

<P>
3. Partnership in social, cultural and human affairs<BR>

<P>
Actions will be soon decided: 
<P>
- in developing human resources: training, education; 
<P>
- in promoting understanding between cultures and civilisations,
such periodic meetings of representatives of religious institutions
or academics; 
<P>
- in pushing exchanges between civil societies: youth exchanges,
interaction between media, exchanges of experiences between municipalities
and regional authorities.<BR>

<P>
In conclusion, there is hope only if there is:<BR>

<P>
- a reasonable minimum of political stability, freedom and pluralism;
the continuation and the success of the peace process between
Israel and its Arab neighbours is therefore critical; working
together on confidence building measures will contribute to such
stability; <BR>

<P>
- a democratic commitment from Governments to share power and
to provide for periodic changes through political reforms; one
after another nondemocratic regimes will crumble peacefully without
revolution or civil war;<BR>

<P>
- a sound macro-economic policy which could inspire confidence
in domestic and international investors: co-operation of the EU
and its partners with international organisations, such as the
World Bank and the IMF will contribute to the success of this
policy; <BR>

<P>
- a limitation of Government interventions in the market mecha-nisms:
deregulation and privatisation will be necessary; small and medium
size enterprises could largely contribute to the diversification
of the respective economies; <BR>

<P>
- an harmonious development of the civil societies during a period
of time where the population of Turkey, Mashrek and Maghreb combined,
will be up to 300 m. by 2025. A real and sincere dialogue and
partnership will help to achieve, progressively and with flexibility,
all these challenges during the next 15 years.

<P>
<B>THE CULTURAL ASPECTS OF CO-OPERATION AND SECURITY IN THE MEDITERRANEAN
<BR>
</B>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Rachid DRISS</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>, President,
<I>Association des Etudes Internationales</I>, Tunis</FONT>
<HR>

<P>
The concept of security has been analysed in depth, for a long
time, by consensus reached by discussions and confrontations of
attitudes. This concept includes military, political, economic
and social aspects. The cultural dimension has not received the
necessary attention it deserves when discussing the problem of
security.<BR>

<P>
Fortunately, Professor Huntington in a famous article in &quot;Foreign
Affairs: The clash of civilisation&quot; has raised challengingly
the question of culture as a factor of conflicts, and consequently
of security.<BR>

<P>
&quot;What do we mean when we talk about civilisation? a civilisation
is a cultural entity&quot;. This is Professor Huntington's theory.
Furthermore he enumerates the elements of a culture: language,
history, religion, dress, institutions... and he adds: civilisations
are differentiated from each other by historical, language, cultural
and most importantly religions traditions.<BR>

<P>
People of different civilisations have different views on the
relation between God and man, the individual and the group, the
citizen and the state, parents and children, husband and wife,
as well as different views of the relative importance of rights
and responsibilities, liberty and authority, equality and hierarchy.
<P>
These differences are the product of centuries, they will not
disappear in the foreseeable future. They are far more fundamental
than differences between political ideologies and regimes. Differences
do not necessarily mean conflict, and conflicts do not mean violence.
Over the centuries, however, differences among civilisations have
generated the most prolonged and &quot;the most violent'' conflict.
<BR>

<P>
I am not going to comment on the thesis of Professor Huntington.
Though I do not share all the ideas he has advanced, I consider
his remarks as pertinent and a source of fruitful debate on the
cultural aspects of security, the impact of civilisation, the
behaviours of nations and individuals, the true importance of
which has been neglected up till now.<BR>

<P>
Taking this theory as a reference, I shall try to go through the
situation in the Mediterranean countries and their peoples and
give suggestions on the use of cultural factors to overcome differences
and build a Mediterranean community. Needless to say at the outset
that to reach this goal we clear a political commitment.<BR>

<P>
The Barcelona Conference of November' 95 constitutes a step in
that direction. In its final Declaration, it emphasised the importance
of the dialogue between cultures and civilisations.<BR>

<P>
A group of experts is due to meet in order to propose concrete
measures and actions in the fields of culture. On the other hand,
it draws attention to the necessity of a better comprehension
between existing religions of the Euro-Mediterranean area as well
as organises meetings between representatives of the religions:
theologians, lay university professors and other interested persons.
The aim of these meetings is to master prejudices, ignorance and
fanaticism and promote co-operation. The Declaration includes
items connected with culture, such as education, science and technology,
the increasingly important media, and raises many problems in
this time of speedy and complex evolution.
<P>
Let us now deal with a few items, considered as elements of culture,
especially about the Mediterranean area. <BR>

<P>
In the Mediterranean region there are more than 10 languages,
not including dialects: Arabic, Berber, Turkish, Hebrew, French,
Italian, Spanish, Greek, Albanian, Slavic, Maltese, Portuguese,
(Portugal is considered part of the Mediterranean area by proximity).
We can also add English, spoken in Malta and Cyprus. All these
languages convey values, concepts, behaviours. Each one of them
can even convey different messages. Let us take Arabic as an example:
it is used by Arab nationalists to glorify the Arab nation and
Arab unity. It is used by Moslems to explain Islam, profess tolerance
and virtue, find the seeds of modernisation in Islamic teaching,
or it can be used by Islamic integrists to refute the modern constitutional
governments and claim an Islamic State with the Koran as the only
source of government or legislation.<BR>

<P>
Another example is the French language which carries the ideas
of the French revolution as well as socialism or capitalism, conservatism
or liberalism and also xenophobia and racism using more or less
the same words.<BR>

<P>
All languages convey traditions inherited from the past which
are the background of peoples' cultures. <BR>

<P>
These traditions can bring people together or separate them. Pascal,
the French philosopher of the 17th century said: &quot;Truth on
this side of the Pyreneans, lies on the other side&quot; and Kipling
said &quot;East and West is West and never the twin shall meet&quot;,
having in mind different cultures and behaviours. I shall come
back to that later when dealing with the religious aspects of
culture. Languages separate by their diversity. How can they facilitate
co-operation between the peoples of the Mediterranean area? We
recognise the problem and we have to solve it in such a way that
language becomes the instrument of understanding and not an instrument
of confrontation.<BR>

<P>
At the end of the 19th century, a philologist, Dr. Zamenhof, born
in Barcelona in 1887, created a new language, with the hope of
realising this union. It was called Esperanto. It did work for
about 50 years, used mostly by intellectuals and pacifists, it
was even proposed as a UN language, but without success, and Esperanto
vanished as it was artificial, without literature or tradition.
After World War II, English is almost becoming a universal language,
but there are reactions from the French, the Spanish and others.
Whatever its audience, English cannot become the single international
language. For centuries, Latin, Greek, Arabic, French were used
by a large number of people who traded with one another. The conclusion
we can draw is that one single language cannot be adopted for
relations between the peoples.<BR>

<P>
The Internet system, considered by experts as a revolution in
the field of communications, whose importance is the equivalent
of the Gutenberg invention of printing, started by circulating
information only in English, but other nations reacted to this
and have started feeding the system with their own language, French
and Spanish texts are already available and other languages will
follow, Japanese, Arabic, German and Russian.<BR>

<P>
The solution to the problem of languages is the ability to learn
and use as many languages as possible. The knowledge of languages
is as important as learning mathematics. A language is the key
that opens doors for co-operating for peace and security. When
words have the same meaning in negotiations, there is a better
chance for understanding and no misunderstanding in translations.

<P>
The School for Oriental Languages in Paris played an important
role in the understanding of other civilisations during the colonial
period.<BR>

<P>
In Tunisia, we emphasise the teaching of languages. People of
Tunisia used to speak Arabic and French, but today we have more
young ones speaking English or German. Recently Hebrew has been
introduced in the university curriculum, but in the Institute
for Foreign Languages, there are teachers of Chinese and Japanese.
The Mediterranean countries should encourage the teaching of languages
as an instrument for better understanding, communication and security.
As I have already stated, language allows people to know about
each other's traditions, ways and means of living, cultural background
and it can either unite or separate them. As we study traditions,
we often discover that they are rooted in religions. <BR>

<P>
In the Mediterranean area, our three religions are monotheistic.
In principle, they teach the same faith in God, but they differ
in conceptions and ways to implement his laws: Jehovah for whom
the Nation of Israel is prominent, God the Father, with Jesus
as the Son and the Holy Spirit form the Trinity, the main principle
of which is the love for the neighbours and Allah for Islam, professing
universality with the concept of Umma (Islamic community). The
analysis of religions is a passionate item. One cannot ignore
that, though the three religions have the same origin: monotheism
is the basis of the three, but there are differences. These differences,
the various interpretations of the founding texts and the conduct
(belief of the believers have been at the origin of religious
conflicts and wars). <BR>

<P>
The Crusades, in the Middle Ages, the Arab-Israeli conflict, to
a certain extent, the war in ex-Yugoslavia between Christian Orthodox
and Moslems, and even the conflict in Chechenia, all have an explanation
or an excuse in religious differences. To have security and co-operation
in the Mediterranean region, we need a better understanding of
our religions and accept once of the differences, a notion of
tolerance in our relations.<BR>

<P>
The Barcelona Declaration, as I have already said, recommended
an action for understanding and tolerance among peoples from different
religious credos. These recommendations were the result of determined
and patient action undertaken especially by UNESCO. Different
meetings and seminars have been held on this subject. One was
held in Carthage, Tunisia, at the Academy of Sciences and Letters
&quot;Beit El Hikma&quot; on 21 and 22 April 1995, with the co-operation
of UNESCO. The participants issued a declaration called &quot;Charte
de Carthage sur la tol&eacute;rance en M&eacute;diterran&eacute;e&quot;.
In this Charter, it is said that the long experience of humanity
shows clearly that no peace between peoples can prevail without
peace between political or religious believers. It therefore emphasises
the duty of the three monotheistic religions of the Mediterranean
to promote in their midsts as well as elsewhere in their relations
with other societies, the values of liberty, tolerance and human
rights. The participants also invited all peoples of good will
to work for the dialogue between the two shores of the Mediterranean
sea for peace, co-operation and tolerance among their populations.
<BR>

<P>
A previous seminar organised by our Association for International
Studies on the relations between Maghreb and European Union on
November 24, 25 and 26, 95 recommended in its final Declaration
a cultural action. <BR>

<P>
Cultural action aims at a deep mutation in the mentalities. It
will strive to eliminate secular prejudices, erase stereotypes
deep in people's minds, giving distorted images, here of Western
societies, there of Islam. Schools, books, newspapers, radio and
television programs, films and theatre shows, all those media
will be in excess in countries on both sides to imprint in everyone's
minds a more serene image of his neighbours, his credos, his customs
and his yearnings. <BR>

<P>
A sense of tolerance, co-operation, human rights and peace has
always been present among the Tunisian elite. The Tunisian reformists
at the end of the 19th century, true to Islamic teaching as well
as the principles of the French Revolution, tried to modernise
the state at the same time as the Ottoman Empire and Egypt. <BR>

<P>
Tunisia abolished slavery in 1846. This decision taken by Ahmed
Bey was in conformity with the Koran which exports Moslems to
liberate slaves. In 1857, Mohammed Bey proclaimed the Security
Charter &quot;Ahd El Aman&quot;, a sort of human rights declaration.
In 1861, a Constitution was proclamaided by the Bey of Tunis Mohamed
Sadok along the same principles. Western thoughts and the ideas
of the French Revolution had their impact on the rulers, who tried
to adapt them to the traditional ways of the government. Kheireddine
Pacha, Prime Minister of Tunisia, then Chancellor of the Ottoman
Empire wrote a book called <I>The best way to know the condition
of Kingdoms.<BR>
</I>
<P>
In this book, he surveys the situation in several European countries
he had visited, their political systems and the improvements they
had achieved. Then he compared them with the situation in Islamic
countries of the Ottoman Empire, and Tunisia in particular, addressing
the politicians and the scholars of Islamic law. He draws their
attention to the difference between Europe's prosperity and contribution
to civilisation, democratic and liberal traditions, implementation
of justice, advancement of science and industrialisation. He explains
that these improvements are the result of a long march of the
European rationalism but they exist also in the fundamental values
of Islam.
<P>
In 1905, Cheikh Abdelaziz Thalbi, the founder of the Destour Party
(Destour means constitution) published a book called <I>The spirit
of liberalism in the Koran</I>. In this book, he glorifies the
European Renaissance, the French Revolution and the Declaration
on Human Rights. He also deals with the progressive status of
women in Islam, the relations between Moslems and Christians,
the universality and the tolerance of Islam at the core of a true
interpretation of the Koran. The main concern of both writers
was to harmonise the Sharia (the Islamic law) with modern times.
<BR>

<P>
We are following the same path. When President Bourguiba decided
in 1956 to give women equal rights with men, he founded this new
law on a liberal interpretation of the Sharia. <BR>

<P>
In the 19th century and the first half of the 20th, modernisation
was advancing in the Islamic word despite the resistance of conservative
doctors of Islamic law. Unfortunately, this trend has been reversed:
we see a violent reaction of the fundamentalists. It can be explained
by the colonialist behaviour, the repeated defeats of the Arabs
in the Middle East and the importance given by Governments to
religion. As a result of the conflict between liberal and conservative
opinions, the Islamic word is living in turmoil. Very few countries
can escape it. In Tunisia, we try to continue in our modernistic
path.<BR>

<P>
In the Mediterranean area, we think that a co-operation between
North and the south can preserve the chances for modernisation,
based on mutual understanding and co-operation. This is the condition
for stability, the prerequisite necessity to avoid conflicts of
civilisations. We have to promote liable structures for co-operation
and build for future generations the bridges for peaceful cohabitation
and joint action for peace, progress and prosperity, with respect
for human rights. <BR>

<P>
Languages and religions can separate or unite, bring conflictual
situations or even ferocious wars feeding misunderstanding, hate
and revenge. They can also encourage nations to live together
in peace and co-operation. The history of the Mediterranean countries
is abundant in conflicts, wars and confusions. At the same time,
it is full of interrelations, exchange of goods and cultures.
The area has been empires rise and collapse, each one of them
leaving behind values and traces of civilisation: Greeks, Phoenicians,
Romans, Arabs and Europeans are all parts of our Mediterranean
world which is characterised now by modern States, with a Judeo-Christian
heritage and a Moslem one. This difference of cultures is a fact,
it characterises our ways of life.<BR>

<P>
Another difference can be noticed; it is the result of the evolution
of history: the contrast between Reason and Mysticism. Reason
derives from Greek philosophy. Reason is one of the elements upon
which Islam bases its argumentation. Mysticism derives from religious
beliefs, spiritual convictions rooted deeply in ancestral traditions.
Science and rationality are born from Reason, devotion and irrationality
are born from mysticism. Civil societies confront religious ones
and we should work towards transforming this confrontation into
understanding. Stability and democracy are at stake. The dilemma
is that this confrontation is not only one of ideas, but a bloody
struggle. It was the case in the Middle Ages, with the Crusades,
and to-day with the integrist movements. To reach the necessary
harmony in cultural differences is not as easy as co-operation
in business affairs. In spite of wars, trade can continue and
business can break barriers. To reach peace in the minds and transform
cultural differences into a synthesis is a far more difficult
task. The establishment of a Euro-Mediterranean Community, in
which people can live in peace and prosper, needs serious and
continual action. 
<P>
The participants in the Barcelona Conference have fortunately
not forgotten the cultural aspect of co-operation and security.
May the future show that a turning point has been reached between
North 
<P>
and South of our &quot;Mare Nostrum&quot;.

<B>AFTER MADRID AND BARCELONA: PROSPECTS FOR MEDITERRANEAN SECURITY
<BR>
<BR>
</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Nabil FAHMY, Political Advisor to H.E. Mr. Amre Moussa,
Minister of Foreign Affairs, Egypt</FONT>
<HR>

<P>
The Mediterranean is a region which has not acquired recognition
as a distinct security zone in its own right. This has been due
to a combination of factors, most important of which have been
that the exigencies of superpower rivalry and the Arab-Israeli
conflict have been superimposed on the security considerations
of Mediterranean states. The region has always been perceived
as an extension of other security zones, namely Europe within
the context of the east-west confrontation, and the Middle East
with both the Arab-Israeli conflict and superpower involvement.
<BR>

<P>
Throughout the cold war, European threat perceptions were frozen
around the east-west divide. Because of the military standoff
along the inter-German border, the states of Europe faced an acute
security environment that periodically deteriorated to the point
of crisis depending on the vicissitudes of US-Soviet rivalry.
This daunting threat perception fixated the national security
policies of Europe eastward, thus subordinating the security concerns
of other areas contiguous to Europe, namely the Mediterranean.
With the possible exception of France, that insisted on maintaining
a high security profile in Africa and the Pacific, Europe looked
to `out-of-area' security issues only through the prism of the
cold war. <BR>

<P>
Similarly, the perennial Arab-Israeli conflict ensured that the
priorities of Middle East states remained fixated on regional
concerns especially in times of crisis, or in the course of the
various peace initiatives floated during the 1980s, and later
on the priorities of Gulf security. Any attempt to look towards
the Mediterranean would inevitably have become entangled in the
complexities of Arab-Israeli relations, superpower involvement
in the region, and more recently, issues relating to the military
balance in the Gulf. <BR>

<P>
In recent years, a fundamental transformation in the security
environment of both regions has generated a host of security concerns
that have impacted strongly on both shores of the Mediterranean.
As a result, growing recognition now exists that these problems,
or at least some of them, must be tackled within a regional Mediterranean
context, distinct from, but not independently of, Europe and the
Middle East. <BR>

<P>
The retreat of the Soviet threat from the east altered the political
consensus regarding the security architecture on the continent.
On the other hand, the perceived threats which surfaced in the
Mediterranean prompted the southern European states to consider
multilateral schemes capable of dealing with a complex array of
new security issues. The interlocking complexity of the military,
demographic, socio-economic, religious, and political problems
which were brought to the fore, and the intensification of global
economic integration, compelled analysts to look towards the construction
of a security architecture founded upon a multi-dimensional approach,
which recognises the intricate linkages between these issues,
as opposed to the strict preoccupation with military security
that had previously characterised the European security agenda.
<BR>

<P>
This trend towards a Mediterranean approach was complemented by
the profound developments in the Middle East, in parallel with
the end of the cold war. The peace process initiated at Madrid
in October 1991 by no means brought an end to the preoccupation
of the region with the Palestine problem. However, the region
was on a course of irreversible change prompting Middle Eastern
states to reassess their foreign policy orientation. The Mediterranean
began to take on greater salience in the priorities of the North
African states, and again there was a recognition of the interlocking
nature of the security issues which must be dealt with. <BR>

<P>
The basic premise of this paper is that the dissipation of a central
threat and the recognition of the multi-dimensional complexity
of the security issues facing the states of the Mediterranean
and the Middle East, provided the auspicious environment and impetus
for the commencement of the dialogue initiated at Barcelona, which
can serve as a framework within which a more effective Mediterranean
security relationship can develop. The nature of the issues which
this dialogue will address are by no means exclusive to the region.
The specific socio-cultural and geographic context, however, will
manifest itself on both shores of the Mediterranean, requiring
both a regional, and intraregional approach to the issues. The
specificity and complexity of the emerging security environment
in the Mediterranean, therefore, will give the region, if not
a distinct homogeneous security identity, a uniquely complex identity
where nonmilitary dimensions of security carry at least as much
weight as traditional military concerns. <BR>

<P>
<B>The Emergence of a Mediterranean Approach<BR>
</B>
<P>
Since the end of the second world war, and the emergence of the
bipolar international structure, security in the Mediterranean
region was always perceived as an extension of the east-west standoff
that divided the European continent. This region was seen as a
perimeter where NATO was to ward off Soviet encroachment to the
alliance's southern flank, or as a platform from which the United
States could project its power into the Middle East by way of
its naval presence in the form of the US Sixth Fleet. The Mediterranean
was thus a pawn on the global chess board where regional security
concerns were subordinated to the strategic policies of the superpowers
and their allies. <BR>

<P>
The subordination of regional security concerns was clearly reflected
in the benign neglect which characterised the European approach
to the Mediterranean within Europe's security institutions. The
CSCE, as well as its contemporary permutations, has always embodied
a Mediterranean component. However, this was addressed with diplomatic
formality where form prevailed over substance more than was the
case with any other subsystem. As this developed, specialised
meetings with non-European Mediterranean states were held. At
a later stage, Mediterranean states were given a status below
that of observer, participating instead in their capacity as &quot;Non-Participating
Mediterranean States&quot; (NPMS). These meetings took place in
Valletta (1978), Venice (1984), Palma de Majorca (1990) and in
Valletta again in 1993. Mediterranean issues, however, were never
elevated to anything above the peripheral status within the CSCE's
agenda. Notwithstanding the decisions reached at the Budapest
summit in late 1994 to establish a contact group at the level
of experts within the framework of the OSCE Permanent Council
in Vienna, the Mediterranean remained little more than a marginal
area of concern for all members except the southern European states.
<BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>1. Euro-Arab Relations<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
Attempts at co-operation between Europe and the Arab world predate
even the early initiatives relating to Mediterranean security.
In 1965, Lebanon was the first state to conclude a three-year
trade agreement with the EC, followed by Egypt in 1972. In the
same year, the then nine member states of the EC responded to
a request made in 1971 by the European Parliament and started
to look into an overall Mediterranean policy that opened up prospects
for co-operation in several areas, an initiative that was referred
to as the &quot;Revised Mediterranean Policy&quot;. Consequently,
discussions with the three Maghreb countries (Algeria, Morocco,
Tunisia) began on that basis in 1973 leading to the conclusion
of agreements between the Community and each of the three states
in 1973. Egypt, Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan followed in 1976. The
co-operative agreements between the EC and the seven Arab Mediterranean
countries were almost identical in nature, focusing on trade preferences
and economic stabilisation, as well as financial and technical
co-operation embodied in a series of protocols of renewable five
year time periods.<BR>

<P>
These initiatives, however, were pursued and developed more within
a bilateral framework between the EC and each Arab Mediterranean
state. There was no serious effort to deal with the Mediterranean
countries together within a multilateral framework. Because of
the preoccupation of both the Arab and southern European states
with the Middle East and the east-west conflict respectively,
the notion of Mediterranean multilateralism never got off the
water. This was clearly reflected in the fate of the &quot;Euro-Arab
Dialogue&quot;. <BR>

<P>
Initiated in 1976, the dialogue was not meant to deal specifically
with Mediterranean issues but rather co-operation between European
and Arab states. However, if it had continued, it would inevitably
have come to embody a pronounced Mediterranean component given
the fact that the region constitutes the main area of geographical
contiguity between Europe and the Arab world. In addition to the
divergent security and political agendas of the parties involved,
the reasons behind the failure of the Euro-Arab dialogue were
also closely linked to the inter-regional divisions which emerged
in the Middle East following the signing of the Camp David Accords
and the outbreak of the Iran Iraq war, as well as differences
within the Atlantic Alliance over the approach which should be
adopted towards the region. The schism that emerged between Egypt
and the Arab states precluded a common Arab stand <I>vis-a-vis</I>
co-operation with Europe, and the lack of receptivity on the part
of the United States to an independent European security policy
in the Middle East diluted the enthusiasm with which the EC approached
the dialogue. The Euro-Arab dialogue thus remained frozen for
most of the 1980s, and after France attempted to revive the process
in December 1989, it was again stalled by the outbreak of the
Gulf crisis. <BR>

<P>
The main conclusion to be drawn from this phase is that the security
concerns of the Middle East and Europe - areas contiguous to but
not a part of the Mediterranean - impinged upon attempts to initiate
a security dialogue across the shores of the Mediterranean. In
essence, prospects for developing a distinct security identity
for the region remained captive to, even submerged by, strategic
developments emanating essentially from areas outside the Mediterranean
itself. <BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>2. Europe's Security Evolution<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
By the end of the 1980s, however, several regional and global
developments combined to gradually loosen the bonds between the
Mediterranean and Europe's security architecture to which it had
previously been so tightly bound, and from the Middle East to
which it was linked through the nexus of the Arab-Israeli conflict
and Persian Gulf oil. Divorcing Mediterranean security from strategic
developments in Europe and the Middle East would be inconceivable.
However, a host of security issues began to emerge, the impact
of which was felt most strongly in the regional Mediterranean
context. <BR>

<P>
The disintegration of the Soviet empire in Eastern Europe finally
brought an end to the standoff that had divided the continent
along the cease-fire lines of World War II. The breakup of the
communist bloc focused European attention mostly on the power
vacuum that emerged in the east, and profoundly altered the security
equation on the European continent as a whole. Inevitably therefore,
the European approach to Mediterranean security issues found a
niche in their concerns. The overarching but coherent Soviet threat
to western Europe was replaced by a host of more limited but equally
demanding security issues affecting different members of the western
alliance asymmetrically. The perceived threat of refugees and
economic dislocation in the east affected Germany much more than
the rest of the continent; the threat of migration from the southern
shores of the Mediterranean affected France and Spain much more
than it did, say, Britain or Germany; and the instability in the
Balkans triggered by the breakup of the Yugoslav Federation threatened
to spark a regional crisis that could suck in such countries as
Italy, Greece and Turkey. <BR>

<P>
The collective security institutions which had previously guaranteed
security on the continent against the Soviet threat failed to
deal decisively with this diverse array of security threats. Although
NATO finally stepped in to enforce the tenuous peace put together
in the Balkans, this was essentially a manifestation of American
leadership. It also remains to be seen whether the commitment
of the alliance will stand if the conflict flares up once again.

<P>
Similarly, it is difficult to conceive of either NATO or the WEU
intervening to stem the tide of refugees that threaten the states
of southern Europe. Unsettling question marks still hang over
NATO's nuclear umbrella now that the fragmentation of the Soviet
Union's nuclear arsenal impacts differently upon each country's
deterrent posture. Finally, the uncertainty surrounding such questions
is reinforced as growing isolationist sentiment in the United
States casts serious doubts on the sustainability of the American
commitment to Europe's defense.
<P>
The combined result of these factors is what several security
analysts have described as the 'renationalisation' of Europe's
security policy, meaning that security threats now impact more
forcefully on alliance members individually rather than on the
alliance as a whole. How this will impact on the overall security
structure in Europe, and thus the Mediterranean, still remains
to be seen. It is unlikely that this trend will lead to the demise
of either the NATO alliance or the European pillar embodied in
the WEU. However, the changing nature of the emerging security
threats on the continent, and the reassessment of Europe's security
institutions, has created an extremely fluid environment that
has opened up a greater margin of maneuver for European states.
This can be discerned in several significant developments with
regards to the security policies of individual alliance members:
Germany's unilateral recognition of Croatia and Slovenia immediately
following the dissolution of the Yugoslav Federation; the independent
stand taken by Greece on the issue of Macedonia; the important
steps taken so far with regards to closer Franco-German security
co-operation; and the initiative taken by Italy and Spain, followed
by France, towards closer Mediterranean co-operation beginning
in 1990.<BR>

<P>
The Spanish-Italian initiative proposed the creation of a CSCE-type
framework for the Mediterranean - hence its formal title, `The
Conference on Co-operation and Security in the Mediterranean'
(CSCM). The Non-Aligned Mediterranean states had already expressed
their support for such a proposal in June 1990 thus paving the
way for Spain and Italy to present a joint non-paper on a CSCM
to the Palma de Majorca CSCE meeting on 24 September 1990. The
non-paper recognised the serious demographic and economic imbalances
existing in the area and their adverse social and cultural consequences.
The CSCM was conceptualised as constituting a joint instrument
the purpose of which was to ward off a potential collision between
the southern and northern shores of the Mediterranean in what
was becoming a new frontier of Europe. <BR>

<P>
The CSCM proposal, however, met with little support by the CSCE
participants, especially France, which criticised the initiative
on the basis of its inapplicability to such a vast and diverse
area as the Mediterranean. The French argument - later developed
into the 5+5 process - stressed that a CSCM like framework must
start with a `core' group of states comprised of the five Maghreb
states (Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Libya and Mauritania) and the
five European Mediterranean countries (Spain, France, Italy, Portugal
and Malta). A meeting at the level of Foreign Ministers was held
in Rome on December 10, 1990, in which Malta was granted the status
of an &quot;associate participant&quot; but was soon given the
status of full participant the following year during the second
Ministerial meeting held in Algiers in October 1991. <BR>

<P>
Thus, by the turn of the decade, the fundamental changes in Europe's
security environment combined to prompt the first stirrings of
a southern European approach towards the Mediterranean within
a multilateral framework. The fragmentation of the Soviet empire
brought with it a reassessment of threat perceptions of Europe's
major actors that consequently generated a state of flux with
regards to the overall security architecture on the continent.
This prompted the states of southern Europe to embark on a number
of initiatives that sought to focus attention on the Mediterranean
basin within some sort of grouping bringing together the states
of the region. 
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>3. The Middle East Security Evolution<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
A similar trend can be discerned with regards to developments
in the Middle East. The significant steps taken towards resolving
the Arab-Israeli conflict, and especially the Palestinian issue,
have led to a profound reassessment on the part of Middle Eastern
states with regards to their regional policies. This development
has diluted the exclusive preoccupation of Middle Eastern states
with the Arab-Israeli conflict, and the nuances of their position
towards Israel. As progress was witnessed in the peace talks,
Arab states began to look beyond the confines of the region for
outlets of manoeuver in order to augment their regional position.
<BR>

<P>
Egypt in particular looked to the Mediterranean area and Europe
in order to secure markets for its exports and ensure an alternative
supply of high technology. Egypt's motives in this regard were
also influenced by a profound recognition that a dangerous north-south
schism was developing across the Mediterranean basin due to the
economic and demographic imbalances between the North African
and southern European states. These imbalances have also taken
on religious overtones that are threatening to transform this
schism into a cultural antagonism dividing both shores of the
Mediterranean. Egypt's Mediterranean Forum proposal presented
in April 1991 at the European Parliament in Strasbourg was based
on the necessity of instituting some sort of political and cultural
dialogue to ameliorate what could potentially develop into a volatile
security situation. <BR>

<P>
In short, the regional transformations witnessed by both Europe
and the Middle East after the end of the cold war profoundly altered
the security situation of the Mediterranean countries and permitted
the development of a nascent security approach towards the area.
The problems that began to emerge in the Mediterranean area could
no longer be thought of as simply an appendage of the security
concerns of the NATO alliance. Similarly, the North African states
saw that these problems were not all predominantly linked to the
Arab-Israeli conflict. <BR>

<P>
Again it is important to emphasise that this does not imply that
Mediterranean issues can be decoupled from the wider security
zones of either Europe or the Middle East. Alliance concerns and
conflicts in Europe and the Middle East will continue to impinge
on Mediterranean security, and will inevitably influence the ultimate
security architecture which prevails in the area. However, the
diverse cultural and religious context in which the security issues
of the area are unfolding, makes it inconceivable to perceive
them as simply an extension of NATO's southern defense perimeter,
or in attempting to view them through the prism of the Arab-Israeli
conflict. <BR>

<P>
If not addressed appropriately, this new breed of security threats
faced by the Mediterranean will become daunting. The threat of
massive migration from the south to the north; the danger of economic
dislocation leading to social disruptions and consequently to
ethnic strife and religious xenophobia; the growing economic rift
between north and south as the process of European integration
deepens; and the threat of weapons proliferation along the southern
Mediterranean rim, have all become familiar themes in the security
literature dealing with the area, and there is consequently little
need to elaborate upon them here. <BR>

<P>
What is perhaps less well known, but no less important in explaining
the current changes in the region, is the impact of global economic
and technological forces in intensifying these dislocations. I
refer specifically to the advent of the information revolution,
the impact of which on the current global economic, cultural,
and social order will be nothing less than profound. The social
and political consequences of the current technological revolution
are daunting in their complexity and, consequently, are not yet
fully understood.<BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>4. The Social Consequences of the Technological
Revolution<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
In a strictly technical sense, the information revolution refers
to the merger between communications and computer technology thereby
greatly augmenting the ability to process, store, and disseminate
information. However, the significance of this revolution lies
not so much in the technology but in its remarkable ability to
compress time and space, thereby fundamentally altering the nature
of social activity once it is transferred to the information network.
When the forces of the market merge with the information revolution
through the ever expanding network, business organisations will
expand their reach to a degree unprecedented in magnitude or scope,
allowing business operations to be conducted on a global scale.
<BR>

<P>
This remarkable ability to transcend the traditional confines
of time and space is what gives information technology its incredible
power. This power, in turn, gives it the ability to erode the
barriers that obstruct the free flow of information, including
the nation state itself. <BR>

<P>
Wealth and competitive advantage in information economies lie
in sophisticated information handling rather than in the ownership
or management of capital. This has led to the rise of a nascent
class that US Secretary of Labor Robert Reich termed 'symbols
analysts' - a class of professionals who thrive on the network
by manipulating digital information. Because the network has no
physical location, and because the global reach of business reduces
the dependence of the economy on the nation state, this class
becomes disembodied of its national loyalties. The nation state
itself becomes less and less capable of regulating the economy,
and therefore sustaining the extensive welfare system that underpinned
the social order and guaranteed loyalty to the state. Since work
in the information economy depends on the requisite education
and training, an ever larger sector of the population becomes
economically marginalised. <BR>

<P>
The trend which emerges from this development is one of an ever
greater concentration of wealth in the hands of those who no longer
depend on the state to sustain their economic activity, leaving
behind an impoverished underclass which cannot hope to compete
in such a demanding environment. Caught in between is the middle
class of managers and high income workers. Those who manage to
acquire the requisite skills will be elevated to the ranks of
the symbols analysts that run the economy, those that do not will
join the ranks of the underemployed facing the persistent threat
of job insecurity. <BR>

<P>
The middle class has always constituted the bulwark of loyalty
for the nation state. As its position is undermined, however,
other loyalties begin to supersede the ideology of secular nationalism.
Primordial loyalties based on ethnicity, race or communal affiliation
take its place for that strata of society which has been marginalised
by the fast-paced economy, while a kind of cosmopolitan `supranationalism'
captivates those who live and work on the network. The nation
state thus becomes undermined by the dual pressures of the rise
of subnational loyalties from below, and the secession of the
economic elite from above. <BR>

<P>
This trend is reinforced by the social and cultural consequences
that accompany the spread of information technologies. One of
the hallmarks of the information revolution is its incredible
ability to propagate and disseminate images. This power is now
being harnessed by business organisations so that market advantage
is now dependent on packaging and repackaging products in images
and icons with a distinctly American quality. What is actually
marketed, therefore, is not the product itself, but images reflecting
the rise of `soft' industries based on entertainment, advertising,
media and information services that are woven together to create
a kind of global theme park reflecting cosmopolitan American life
style and values. This development, however, constitutes an incredibly
powerful cultural force that often assaults the indigenous value
systems that it hopes to integrate into the global market. <BR>

<P>
This, in turn, inevitably generates a cultural backlash that seeks
to emphasise religious and cultural identity as a form of psychological
reassurance against the cultural assault of - in this case - western
materialism. This backlash is by no means exclusive to Arab or
Third World cultures as is evidenced by the rise of conservative
sentiment that has shifted the political spectrum rightwards in
such countries as the United States, Germany, France and Great
Britain that has been accompanied with a strong nationalistic
and xenophobic flavor. What serves to exacerbate this trend towards
cultural and religious xenophobia is the transparency that comes
with the communications revolution. Because of its remarkable
ability to compress time and space, the information revolution
significantly contracts the socio-cultural space that previously
insulated separate social groups.<BR>

<P>
How these powerful trends will affect the political and security
situation in the Mediterranean cannot yet be discerned with any.
However, one can attempt to establish a tentative link between
these developments and the general socio-cultural trends witnessed
by communities on both shores of the Mediterranean. One only has
to look at the recent election results in such countries as Italy,
France, Greece, and Turkey to notice a gradual shift of the political
spectrum towards the right. Similarly, the creeping tide of cultural
and religious conservatism in North Africa threatens to open up
a north-south cultural rift across the Mediterranean. The economic
imbalances caused by the intensification of market forces inevitably
reinforce this trend. The disparities in wealth both within Mediterranean
countries, and between the European and North African flanks of
the region, are undermining the social pillars of support that
sustained the secular national order. What this inevitably generates
is a creeping cultural radicalism that leads to the rejection
of the `other' however defined. Not only does this xenophobic
trend serve to solidify the cultural divide emerging across the
Mediterranean, but also threatens to spill over onto both shores
with every incident of communal violence against foreigners or
immigrant workers. <BR>

<P>
Security, in this sense, therefore tends to take on an abstract
quality intertwined with the complexities of social and political
interaction in the information age. No longer can security be
gauged in strictly military terms. Security must be based on a
multidimensional approach in order to be able to cope with this
new breed of threats which are specific, although not exclusive
to, the Mediterranean area. It is this recognition on the part
of Mediterranean states in the particularity of the security threats
they face that is giving rise to the notion of a distinctly `Mediterranean'
security regime based on dialogue and a multidimensional security
approach, regardless of the fact that this regime is still in
its preliminary stages. <BR>

<P>
How these issues will be tackled, however, will depend on the
ultimate security framework that emerges for the area as a whole.
Recognition of the complex multi-faceted nature of the security
threats facing Mediterranean states, in and of itself, will not
be sufficient to ensure that they will be successfully addressed.
This will depend to a large extent on how the multiple security
interests in the region are reconciled making the process of institution
building in the Mediterranean a complex exercise in balancing
the competing frameworks put forward for the security of the region,
including the influence of extra-regional parties.<BR>

<P>
<B>Reconciling the Overlapping Interests in the Mediterranean
<BR>
</B>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>1. Managing the European-Mediterranean Linkage
<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
As was mentioned in the introduction to this paper, the state
of flux that characterised Europe's security architecture after
the cold war opened the door for the recognition of Mediterranean
security concerns as one among several competing areas of priority
that must be addressed. What this signifies is not the detachment
of the area from Europe, but that the current security debate
on the continent now must encompass security concerns that directly
relate to the Mediterranean. <BR>

<P>
Europe's ultimate security structure will be decided according
to how it manages to reconcile the competing Atlantic, European,
and inter-European visions for European security. It would be
a misperception to think that this linkage with European security
will subjugate the Mediterranean to purely European and American
concerns. The nature of the security threats in the region, and
the recognition of the need for a multilateral approach to address
them, precludes this possibility. However, it would be impossible
to formulate a viable security framework for the area unless the
interests of the various actors in Europe, and even the United
States, are taken into account and loosely or informally integrated
into an institutional framework in which they can complement,
rather than compete with, each other.
<P>
Managing this linkage, however, will be a difficult task even
if we restrict ourselves to the traditional military dimension
of security. The latent tension between the national security
interests of NATO members and the collective security commitments
of the alliance has always been most pronounced in the Mediterranean.
This explains why NATO was never able to incorporate the area
within its integrated defence structure, and instead relied on
the US naval presence to ward off Soviet encroachment on the southern
defence perimeter of the alliance. The region thus remained as
a `gray zone' within the alliance's defence structure in which
the question of whether the US naval force served purely American
or alliance interests was never quite defined. <BR>

<P>
This ambiguity that has characterised the position of the Mediterranean
within alliance politics will have a profound impact on the ultimate
security approach adopted for the region. Also important will
be the issue of the competing `European' and `Atlantic' visions
for European security. The current emphasis on greater burden-sharing
within NATO by strengthening the alliance's European pillar is
only one facet of the issue. Equally important is whether the
WEU will be integrated into NATO's defence structure, or whether
it will constitute the military arm of a strengthened EU once
the differences on formulating agreement on a common foreign and
security policy are resolved. <BR>

<P>
If Europe fails to resolve the Atlantic-European tension in its
security policy, then the present arrangement within NATO guaranteeing
American preeminence within alliance affairs will likely prevail.
In that event, if European security policy towards the Mediterranean
continues to be formulated within the NATO framework, the resulting
approach is not likely to constitute a viable multilateral formula
for the area. 
<P>
Like other institutions of the cold war, NATO has always regarded
the region with little more than marginal concern, a fact evidenced
by the initiatives taken by the alliance towards the area following
the end of the cold war. As was the case with the CSCE, NATO undertook
several declaratory steps towards closer co-operation with Mediterranean
countries. In their declaration issued in Brussels on January
11, 1994, the Heads of State and Government of NATO reiterated
their &quot;conviction that security in Europe is greatly affected
by security in the Mediterranean&quot;. They strongly welcomed
the agreements concluded within the framework of the Middle East
peace process and regarded this &quot;much awaited&quot; breakthrough
as having a positive impact on the situation in the Mediterranean.
They subsequently directed the North Atlantic Co-operation Council
(NACC) to continue to review the overall situation in the region,
and encouraged all efforts conducive to strengthening regional
stability. <BR>

<P>
This was followed, in December 1994, by the initiative of the
NATO Foreign Ministers to open a dialogue between the alliance
and the non-NATO Mediterranean states. Within this framework,
NATO invited Egypt, Israel, Morocco, Tunisia, and Mauritania to
study their views concerning stability in the Mediterranean and
prospects for possible co-operation with the alliance. NATO's
initiatives, however, did not seek to establish any institutional
linkages between the alliance and these states, nor did they envisage
what type of linkage would exist between the Mediterranean and
Europe as a whole. <BR>

<P>
More serious perhaps than the absence of any institutional framework
for the NATO initiatives are the possibly adverse consequences
resulting from the maintenance of the US naval deployment in the
Mediterranean without a multilateral framework governing its presence.
As Roberto Aliboni has perceptively pointed out, &quot;the national
dimension of the US naval presence in the Mediterranean could
prevail over its multilateral dimension.&quot; European naval
deployment in the area could also have a similar effect. The fact
that a predominantly American - European military presence in
the area operates without a multilateral cover could heighten
concerns on the part of some southern Mediterranean states regarding
US and European intentions. Security issues in the region, therefore,
would be regarded in terms of deterrable events that can be addressed
through military force without recognition of their cultural and
socio-economic root causes. The current north-south divide would
thus become militarised, cementing the division of the region
into two antagonistic blocs that would accentuate the trend towards
cultural xenophobia that is emerging on both sides of the Mediterranean.
<BR>

<P>
If, however, the European pillar of the alliance is strengthened
and integrated into NATO's defence structure, one can expect a
more pronounced European role in Mediterranean security. This
would also be the case if the WEU were to emerge as the military
arm of an EU that would gradually assume more responsibility for
the continent's defence, although this scenario remains problematic
given the difficulties that plague such matters as formulating
a collective nuclear umbrella and an integrated command structure.
In both cases, however, the strength of Europe's commitment to
a Mediterranean outlook would depend on how the foreign policy
priorities of the major European states are reconciled; in particular
between Germany's eastward focus on the countries of the former
Soviet bloc, and France's southern foreign policy orientation.
<BR>

<P>
However these competing priorities are reconciled, this would
still leave the issue of the American role and military presence
in the region undefined. A more prominent European security profile
does not automatically mean an end to the US military presence
in the area, nor even its reduction. What it will imply, however,
is the dominance of US national security concerns over whatever
collective commitments it may have considered within the NATO
alliance. Any Mediterranean multilateral framework, therefore,
must somehow accommodate American interests in order to ward off
what could develop into a serious competition for influence that
could have destabilising consequences in the form of a regional
arms race.<BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>2. The Madrid Process and Mediterranean Security
<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
The process begu at Madrid has set in motion a loose but comprehensive
framework for Middle East dialogue and co-operation that has the
potential to extend to the Mediterranean. As was demonstrated
during the 1980s, developments in the Middle East region cast
a powerful shadow on wider Mediterranean concerns which become
entangled in such issues as relations with Israel, the regional
arms race, and the latent competition between the United States
and Europe for influence in the region. 
<P>
The Madrid process seeks to disentangle such issues in order to
enhance co-operation between the states of the region. This does
not mean that the multilateral tracks can proceed in isolation
of progress on the bilateral negotiations. The 'Multilateral track'
has been divided into five working groups that are separate but
with an implicit linkage between them as well as between this
track and the bilateral - conflict resolution - tracks of the
peace process.<BR>

<P>
Provided that this issue of linkage is handled carefully, together
with other sensitive issues such as the current military imbalance
between Israel and the Arab states, and Israel's nuclear posture,
the multilateral track can constitute a framework around which
co-operation can emerge and spin off with a positive southern
Mediterranean contribution to the Mediterranean security debate.
<BR>

<P>
This is particularly true for the ACRS track. The Arms Control
and Regional Working Group (ACRS) has, in many ways, informally
emulated the cooperative security model applied in Europe in developing
its work. During the first phase of ACRS, regional parties were
introduced to the modalities and procedures that guided the CSCE
and the US-Soviet arms control experience. In the third ACRS plenary
meeting held in Washington in May 1993, it was agreed that the
parties would consider a number of CSCE-like CBMs. Such CBMs included
the exchange of military information, risk reduction measures,
and agreements on measures to prevent incidents at sea (INCSEA)
and to cooperate in search and rescue maritime missions (SAR).
<BR>

<P>
It was also agreed in Washington that parties would hold intersessional
activities, each entrusted with a specific assignment. Mentor
states were nominated from outside the Middle East to assist regional
states in four main domains; <BR>

<P>
- The United States and the Russian Federation were to guide efforts
to define the ultimate objectives of ACRS and to help parties
on a set of declaratory CBMs and the principles of the security
process;<BR>

<P>
- Canada was to assist efforts on maritime CBMs and means of preventing
incidents at sea;<BR>

<P>
- Turkey was to assist efforts to explore alternative means of
exchanging military information and prenotification of military
exercises and large-scale movements;<BR>

<P>
- The Netherlands was to assist in efforts to establish a regional
crisis communications network in the Middle East. Again following
the European experience, agreement was reached in Moscow to divide
the future intersessional activities of ACRS into two main baskets.
The Conceptual Basket was to include all conceptual aspects of
the process while the Operational Basket mainly dealt with practical
mechanisms to increase military transparency and reduce dangers
of unintended military escalation. Particularly noteworthy in
this regard is that the conceptual basket - albeit without success
so far - has attempted to develop a Regional Security and Arms
Control Declaration for the Middle East, encompassing principles,
parameters and objectives. 
<P>
ACRS has continued for over three years to deal with an extensive
agenda aiming at the creation of a new Middle East security environment.
However, after the April 1995 Review/ Extension Conference of
the NPT, with Arab-Israeli differences resulting from Israel's
refusal to accede to the treaty or to negotiate a Nuclear Weapons
Free Zone in the Middle East, ACRS activities have subsided. The
ACRS process thus became hostage to Israel agreeing to deal constructively
and structurally with the nuclear issue. The failure of the ACRS
members to adopt the Declaration on Regional Security and Arms
Control came as a direct result of Israel's failing to agree to
commit to adhere to the Non-Proliferation Treaty even in the future.
<BR>

<P>
This was clearly evidenced after the sixth ACRS plenary held in
Tunis, which made several recommendations including the possible
working out of a mandate for a Regional Security Center (RSC)
in the Middle East. In Jordan, Tunis and Qatar pursuant to that
meeting no agreement was reached concerning the RSC document due
to Egypt's insistence on the creation of some type of linkage
between the functions of the RSC and the establishment of a NWFZ
in the region, rather than being limited in its activity to the
classical conflict prevention domain.<BR>

<P>
Two things are important to note in the work of the ACRS working
group. First, the activities of the working group are only one
dimension of a matrix of five covered by the multilateral working
groups on Water, Environment, Refugees, Economic Co-operation
and Arms Control, which together exemplify the multidimensional
approach that could form the basis for wider security co-operation
encompassing the Mediterranean area. This, however, will depend
on the delicate link which exists between the process of institutionalising
CBMs in the Middle East and the issue of Israel's nuclear position.
The question of Israel's nuclear posture, and the issue of the
linkage between the multilateral and bilateral tracks, point to
the second, and perhaps more important aspect. The involvement
of several European actors in the activities of ACRS means that
the sensitivity of the issues discussed will clearly have an impact
on any Mediterranean multilateral framework combining Europe and
the non-European Mediterranean states, a fact which was clearly
emphasised at Barcelona.<BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>3. Barcelona and the Prospects for a Multilateral
Framework<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
The historic meeting which took place in Barcelona in November
of last year reflected the change in perceptions regarding the
security of the Mediterranean region. The issue of whether regional
security would be addressed within a strictly Mediterranean context
envisioned in the '5+5' initiative, the CSCM, or the Mediterranean
Forum, a wider framework encompassing European security concerns,
was finally resolved in the form of a Euro-Mediterranean conference.
Whether such a framework will survive to constitute a viable security
regime for the area is not yet clear, and will ultimately depend
on both the final security architecture which emerges in Europe,
and the course of the Madrid peace process in the Middle East.
The Declaration adopted at Barcelona exemplified the multidimensional
approach to security that recognises the deep-rooted linkages
between security and economic and social development, as was evidenced
in the references throughout the text to the common' challenges
necessitating a common security approach. Also apparent was the
recognition of the non-military dimension of security in the form
of demographic dislocation causing current migration flows. Although
not mentioned within the security chapter, there was implicit
recognition that such an issue has obvious security implications.
<BR>

<P>
This does not mean, however, that differences do not exist. In
particular potential differences may emerge in the various conceptions
regarding such basic principles as democracy and human rights.
The only way that such differences will be resolved is through
a cultural dialogue to reconcile the contending interpretations
surrounding these concepts. Another divisive issue could emerge
with regards to the treatment of migrant workers, and especially
the policy of the European states which admit the possibility
of the return of illegal migrant workers to their countries of
origin. What needs to be recognised is that whatever policy is
adopted in this regard will carry with it profound social consequences
that will inevitably have ramifications on other areas of European-Mediterranean
co-operation. In addition to this heightened cultural dimension
of Euro-Mediterranean relations, there will also be the problem
of politicising such thorny issues such as `self-determination'.
This will inevitably cause differences when applied to issues
such as the Cypriot question, the Balkans, and above all the Middle
East with regards to Palestine. <BR>

<P>
This last point avidly portrays the overlap between the Middle
East and the Mediterranean, an overlap that and which was most
apparent in the security chapter of the Barcelona Declaration
which highlighted a host of security issues that have a special
relevance to the Middle East. These included such issues as arms
control and the regional arms race, especially the reference to
the creation of a `Middle East' zone free of weapons of mass destruction
and their delivery systems, and the reference to the possibility
of `regional and sub-regional security co-operation'. What clearly
demonstrated the overlap between the two regions, however, was
the exchange at the Barcelona conference between the Syrian and
Israeli Foreign Ministers that dominated a substantial portion
of the meeting. That a Middle Eastern issue could impinge so forcefully
on a forum designed to discuss Mediterranean co-operation is testimony
to the strength of the linkage between both regions. <BR>

<P>
It is therefore these linkages that will decide how the multidimensional
security approach on which a tentative consensus was reached at
Barcelona will be addressed. What Barcelona managed to achieve
was the formulation of a broad proposal for co-operation grounded
in a firm recognition of the non-military aspects of security.
What was thus envisaged was a functional approach encompassing
such areas as investment, the environment, tourism, information
technology and telecommunications, fisheries, and transport to
name only a few. This broad framework is supposed to take concrete
form in the follow up meetings. <BR>

<P>
However, this will depend on whether the Euro-Mediterranean framework
envisaged in Barcelona can be transformed into a viable security
regime for the region. As was already mentioned, the fate of this
broad cooperative framework will be intimately linked to the course
of the Euro-Mediterranean process as a whole. If the Barcelona
framework manages to reconcile the contending visions within the
EU for European security, and is complemented by a stable peace
process in the Middle East, then the prospects for the development
of a cooperative security regime are positive. If, however, the
Barcelona process fails to develop into a viable framework capable
of filling the institutional vacuum in the Mediterranean, then
the cooperative schemes envisaged for the region will suffer the
fate of the previous Mediterranean initiatives that failed to
reconcile the competing interests of the multiplicity of actors
involved.<BR>

<P>
<B>Conclusion: Towards a Flexible Institutional Framework<BR>
</B>
<P>
By a historical coincidence that is rare in modern history, the
countries of Europe and the Middle East have found themselves
looking towards each other across the Mediterranean, both cognisant
of the pressing need to institute some sort of cultural and security
dialogue in order to prevent the emergence of a cultural rift
between them. 
<P>
The true significance of the end of the bipolar international
order lies in the fact that the intersecting geopolitical and
cultural zones that were hitherto sucked into the vortex of superpower
rivalry are now open to the emergence of new power centers and
cooperative interaction. This phenomenon of greater regionalisation
of international relations is clearly exhibited in such areas
as eastern Europe that is now open to the spread of German influence,
Southeast Asia that is gradually emerging as an economic zone
tied to the powerful Japanese economy, a North American zone under
the hegemony of the United States, and the Mediterranean area
between Europe and the Middle East. <BR>

<P>
The rise of regionalism is being fuelled by the confluence of
several factors, only one of which is the waning of superpower
dominance. More important perhaps is the emergence of a new breed
of security threat that defies the traditional approach to security
as defined in military terms. The illusory semblance of stability
maintained by both superpowers in their respective spheres of
influence ensured that latent geopolitical and socio-cultural
tensions remained hidden from the view of policy makers, waiting
to resurface once the power structures constructed by Washington
and Moscow began to erode. The predominant characteristic of this
new type of threat is the intricate complexity of the issues it
poses, a complexity which will increase as the awesome power of
the technological revolution breaks down the traditional barriers
that had limited the scope of communal, social and political interaction.
<BR>

<P>
Complex security threats cannot be segmented into separate military
and non-military solutions. Rather, they must be faced by a sophisticated
approach that recognises this deep-seated complexity. The states
bordering on the Mediterranean have clearly recognised the need
of adopting such an approach within a multilateral regional framework.
Both sides have had prior experience in this regard: Europe within
the context of the OSCE, and the Middle East with the fragile
experiment at multilateral co-operation now being undertaken.

<P>
Consequently, both sides accept the reality that the security
challenges they now face are making themselves felt most strongly
in the regional Mediterranean context, and therefore require an
approach tailored to the specific cultural and political context
of the region. One can therefore expect that the strategic and
cultural changes that have lead to the renewal of interest in
the Mediterranean, will prompt a more intensified form of cultural
dialogue between both sides. This does not mean that military
security will be unimportant. However, military manifestations
of conflict are symptoms of much deeper causes not all of which
are under the purview of governments. <BR>

<P>
Cultural dialogue must therefore be complemented by a multilateral
security framework, within which it must be conducted. Such a
framework is essential if the various strategic interests of the
regional and extra-regional actors are to be reconciled. This
does not necessitate the creation of an all-inclusive forum in
which the security structure of the region is defined in detail.
This type of framework would be too rigid and cumbersome to deal
with the fluid security situation that is emerging in the Mediterranean.
<BR>

<P>
What can be considered instead, at least for the meantime, is
a complementary arrangement that may even include several frameworks
operating in tandem. In this sense, the various fora put forward
for the region do not have to be seen as mutually exclusive. Depending
on the nature of the issue being discussed, different frameworks
can operate, thus including different combinations of actors according
to the situation. For example, issues such as migration and the
environment can be handled within the context of The Mediterranean
Forum; cultural exchange and religious dialogue can be included
within the Euro-Mediterranean framework initiated at Barcelona;
and wider security concerns can be somehow linked to either NATO
or the Trans-Atlantic Charter so as to bring in the United States.
<BR>

<P>
Until such a flexible framework is developed, the efforts of the
Mediterranean states should focus on two possible areas of action.
The first is the need to continue to work on developing a consensus
on the issues put forward at Barcelona. Consensus on such sensitive
issues as human rights, democracy, self-determination, religious
tolerance, together with the initiation of economic and financial
co-operation between the Mediterranean states, can constitute
a first step towards generating agreement on a wider multilateral
framework. What is essential to keep in mind is the necessity
of developing some sort of political framework that will fill
the institutional void in the Mediterranean. This point is crucial.
If no such framework is developed, informal approaches can quickly
become politicised and exacerbate contentious issues rather than
fostering co-operation. <BR>

<P>
This leads to the second area of priority. Consensus building
on the ultimate security framework for the region will be a difficult
and time consuming process. In the meantime, incremental steps
must be taken to avoid potentially contentious areas such as migration,
arms proliferation - especially the issue of nuclear possession
- and terrorism, from hindering the process of consensus building.
Measures on a case-by-case basis that would attempt to prevent
the escalation of differences into conflicts cannot stand by themselves
and could end up legitimising the unacceptable status quo for
a temporary period. On the other hand, measures meant to prevent
the exacerbation of thorny issues by taking concrete if modest
steps towards an ultimate objective should be pursued and could
be useful. As was graphically demonstrated by the recent events
in the Middle East, minor events can spiral out of control and
seriously undermine the painstakingly constructed peace process
despite the political commitment of all the parties involved to
its continuation.<BR>

<P>
Until recently not many were willing to concede that there exists
a specific Mediterranean regionality. That is to say, considering
the great diversity and disparity that exist among its component
parts, does the Mediterranean possess the characteristics that
qualify it to be approached as a single region? No other geographical
area of comparable size incorporates such widely diverse characteristics
and problems and, inevitably, conflict situations and potential.
This concentration of diversity and disparity, with its conflict
potential,in part accounts for the failure on the part of many
riparian states themselves to seek, recognise and promote a common
Mediterranean identity. Yet paradoxically, security in its widest
definition is probably the single most important factor that qualifies
and requires the Mediterranean to be approached as a single region.
Partly as a result of the end of the East-West confrontation,
partly as a side product of Europe&iacute;s own integration process,
the subject of security in the Mediterranean has, quite suddenly,
become a focus of international attention. Mediterranean regionality
is now treated as axiomatic. <BR>

<P>
It is symptomatic of the modern history of the Mediterranean that
the international actors most prepared to regard it as a single
region have been those possessing global interests, viewing it
as a function of those interests. The west&iacute;s post-World
War II definition of the Mediterranean as &euml;Europe&iacute;s
southern flank&iacute; accorded to it such astrategic regionality
- as a function of European security. The Soviet Union likewise
came to regard the Mediterranean as a strategic unit, engaging
in a maritime competition with the predominant United States.
Of course this view of regionality, the corollary of bringing
the Cold War down to the Mediterranean, had nothing to do with
fostering the coherence of the region. Neither did it have as
its primary aim the solution of the problems that afflicted the
Mediterranean people themselves.<BR>

<P>
In a different way and on a different plane, the consolidation
of the European Economic Community in time led to another major
international actor addressing the region as a single entity,
through its comprehensive Mediterranean policies, acknowledging
the importance of striking an economic relationship with its immediate
neighbourhood. Despite many shortcomings, this Mediterranean policy
did seek a relationship of interdependence with Mediterranean
non-member states, revealing a clear sensitivity to the political
dividends of such a relationship. By the 1970s, the European Community
was overtaking the United States as the mainstay of economic and
political, though not of course military, support to many Mediterranean
countries. Especially after the worst of the first Cold War phase
was over, Euro-American disagreement - or at least failure to
co-ordinate policy and action - surfaced over security matters
outside the strict framework of the east-west confrontation. And
this failure to see eye to eye is chiefly noticeable with regards
to Mediterranean affairs. <BR>

<P>
If the USA regarded local problems from the perspective of a world
power with world views, the Mediterranean and its parts were no
exception. The global problem being security in relation to the
USSR, its Mediterranean policy aimed to contain USSR influence.
If US national security interests - as opposed to the broader
western world&iacute;s security interests - were not directly
affected by specific problems of the Mediterranean, the same cannot
be said of western Europe, itself in part Mediterranean. Unlike
the USA, the Europeans could not afford the end-justifies-the-means
approach. Thus for example, where the USA could live with the
contradiction that several south European allies were governed
by right wing antidemocratic regimes, as this was in itself a
guarantee of anti-communism, the Europeans were less comfortable
condoning such regimes on their doorstep. European support for
democratic transition in Portugal, Spain, Greece and Turkey has
been on the whole consistent and concrete.<BR>

<P>
One feature of Euro-American disagreement has been the limits
of NATO&iacute;s scope, with the Americans urging NATO to broaden
its scope to include objectives not related to the Soviet threat
in Europe and the Europeans keen to reserve NATO for the defence
of Europe and its members. In the circumstances, the most likely
candidate areas for so-called out-of-area operations were in the
Mediterranean and its environs, notably the Middle East. Nonetheless,
whereas the United States failed to address NATO to areas adjacent
to, but outside, Europe, in the Mediterranean it unilaterally
pursued security policies that were neither related to any threat
to Europe or to defence from the USSR. This it could do thanks
to its heavy naval presence and its network of military bases
in the Mediterranean. This ability to act in Europe&iacute;s neighbourhood
independently, combined with Europe&iacute;s resistance to the
Alliance&iacute;s operating outside its original brief, resulted
in the Euro-American allies sometimes pursuing different or even
competing policies in the Mediterranean.<BR>

<P>
Other than the defence of Europe&iacute;s southern flank from
the Soviet threat, US policy in the Mediterranean increasingly
came to focus on Middle Eastern oil, especially following the
1973 oil shock. By the late 1970s, this objective had become prominent
enough for the United States to institute the Rapid Deployment
Force, and for constant American surveillance of the Persian Gulf.
It happenedalso that the late 1970s and early 1980s saw a scrambling
of regional alignments in the Middle East, through a series of
events including the change of regime in Iran, the Soviet invasion
of Afghanistan, and the beginning of the Iran-Iraq war. The late
1970s therefore intensified American sensitivity to the issue
of Middle Eastern oil, just as the &euml;second Cold War&iacute;
was beginning. <BR>

<P>
In summary, for almost half a century security in the Mediterranean
has been defined by powers and forces that were either external
or peripheral to the Mediterranean. Whether in terms of Europe&iacute;s
southern flank, or the western world&iacute;s supplies of oil,
or simply as an arena of superpower naval competition, the matter
of broader Mediterranean security was not in the charge of the
Mediterranean riparian states. <BR>

<P>
The contradiction was that while the Mediterranean was regarded
as a area where Europe and the west in general had vital security
interests, the non-European Mediterranean was not and could not
be involved in European security concerns. The contradiction surfaced
more than once in the councils of the Conference on Security and
Co-operation in Europe (CSCE). Whereas the purpose of the CSCE
was to foster security through co-operation in Europe, the main
theatre of the East-West conflict, it proved difficult to persuade
member states, most especially the superpowers, to extend the
scope of the conference to include the whole Mediterranean. As
a result, whatever achievements were made with regards to European
security were not reflected with regards to Mediterranean security.
<BR>

<P>
No sooner was the mantle of the Cold War lifted from international
relations than the extent of the problems of the Mediterranean
became highlighted. If anything, the security problems of the
Mediterranean appear bigger today than they did before 1989. The
only area of progress registered has been the Middle East peace
process, and even that required a major international war in the
Middle East to set it afoot. In compensation, warfare reminiscent
of the nineteenth century erupted in the Balkans, south-north
emigration has accelerated, and fundamentalism has spread in numbers
and militancy in different parts of the Mediterranean.
<P>
The two movements of emigration and fundamentalism are indeed
a barometer of the degree of distance that has been allowed to
develop between the two opposing shores of the Mediterranean,
with the former denoting despair and flight, and the latter resignation
and rejection of the western model of the state with its broken
promises.<BR>

<P>
The question of the future for Mediterranean security in the post-Cold
War era cannot ignore the experience of the past decades, even
if the international situation today is substantively different
from what it was a few years ago. During the past half-century,
the Mediterranean has not only been a theatre of east-west confrontation,
chosen by the non-Mediterranean protagonists of that contest for
its strategic relevance to the main theatre. 
<P>
Less spectacularly but equally importantly and certainly more
durably, the Mediterranean is a political equator between the
two hemispheres of north and south. The healing of one divide
(the east-west) has little or no relevance to the surviving one.
If anything, the north-south divide here is the more glaring for
that reason.<BR>

<P>
For better or worse, the future of Mediterranean security will
continue to be intimately bound with European security. The question
of which security structure will prevail in Europe would seem
to be central to the future of Mediterranean security. Equally
relevant is the nature of the relationship that will evolve between
Europe and the United States - and perhaps also Russia. <BR>

<P>
The question comes down to a simple one: will Europe formulate
its security in collaboration with its southern neighbours, or
will it formulate it in confrontation with them? This is a good
time to posit such questions, not only because security concerns
in the Mediterranean are serious and immediate, but also because
Europe&iacute;s security architecture is in a state of flux. In
part, this is also because identifying the direction from where
European security might be threatened is less easy today than
it was in the later 1940s. On the eastern front, the Soviet threat
has disappeared, but the long tradition of distrust and fear of
Russia have not. On the southern front, meanwhile, the threat
to European security is not a military one - and therefore there
is no simple way of dealing with it. Indeed, the only way to deal
with it appears to be the long and laborious process of healing
the causes. If that is the solution - and certainly from a Mediterranean
point of view it is the best solution - a lot will depend on which
security structure ultimately prevails in Europe, how such a structure
will define European security interests, and what the true targets
of its protagonists are. <BR>

<P>
Until now, of the different European security organisations, NATO
is the clear front-runner. Quickly shedding its Cold War function
it redefined itself as a long term security through co-operation
organisation with a rapid trouble-shooting capability. In so doing
it assumed functions and objectives that collectively subsume
the functions and objectives of its potential competitors, while
proclaiming itself ready to co-ordinate its activities with them.
<BR>

<P>
Furthermore, through the Partnership for Peace it has extended
its field of operations to include practically all of Europe.
By placing itself at the disposal of the CSCE, NATO has circumvented
the problem of replicating the functions of that organisation,
without however giving up its freedom to act on its own initiative.
The future of other, competing, security set-ups which have resurfaced
or come into being after the fall of the Berlin Wall is uncertain,
and the degree of overlap between the different set-ups and initiatives
is bewildering. CSCE, NATO, The Western European Union, the Pact
for Stability in Europe and the embryonic Common Foreign and Security
Policy of the EU may be similar but different. But it will take
time, for some coherence to emerge between all these set-ups if
it ever does. Some are independently making moves and soundings
to address the Mediterranean. What is not clear is whether these
are motivated by the notion of a common Euro-Mediterranean destiny
or by their perception of the southern Mediterranean as a potential
foe.
<P>
In theory, NATO might have disbanded as soon as the Soviet Union
gave up the fight. In theory too, the obvious set-up for the future
security of Europe was the CSCE, for if the concept of achieving
security through co-operation could be valid in a confrontational
situation, it would be even more valid in a peaceful one. Indeed
it is the mission of the CSCE that NATO has claimed to adopt as
an alternative to its Cold War mission. And it is over the entire
territory of the CSCE that NATO has been aiming to spread by inviting
all CSCE members to join its Partnership for Peace programme.
The offer by NATO to place itself as an operational body at the
disposal of the CSCE followed logically. <BR>

<P>
The ascendancy of NATO over all other security set-ups with pan-European
objectives, and the corollary of NATO fitting into the CSCE glove
is not necessarily the best security forecast for the Mediterranean.
Reinforcing the Euro-Atlantic security link, it implicitly competes
with the concept of a Euro-Mediterranean security partnership,
by seeming to perpetrate the Cold War-inspired notion that NATO&iacute;s
primary interest in the Mediterranean is the defence of the West&iacute;s
security. It may be argued, if one can ignore the comments of
NATO&iacute;s former Secretary General, that NATO does not harbour
aggressive feelings towards the Arab neighbourhood in the Mediterranean
and the Middle East. It can also be argued that NATO has transformed
its mission and is not solely or primarily an alliance with a
specific adversary, as it used to be <I>vis-a- vis</I>. the Soviet
Union. Nevertheless, when all is said and done, it remains an
alliance concerned with the security interests of its members
only. That being so, every neighbourhood is a potential adversary.
Most importantly, NATO&iacute;s willingness to serve as the instrument
of the CSCE in no way limits its freedom to act independently
of it. For the same reason that Russia does not welcome the expansion
of NATO&iacute;s towards its borders, it must not be assumed that
the Mediterranean neighbours welcome the entrenchment of NATO
as the European security structure par excellence. Under its American
leadership, and with its potential for assuming even out-of-area
missions on behalf of the UN and/or the OSCE, it appears too much
like an instrument of a first-world dominated New World Order.
That is the more so since it does not come under the control of
either the UN or the OSCE. On top of that, then, the United States
itself retains the freedom to act independently, even of its NATO
allies, in this region.<BR>

<P>
A Pax Americana, whether real or perceived, cannot be the ideal
setting for confidence-building. The drawback of having the United
States concerting Euro-Mediterranean security is that, unlike
Europe, which has a neighbour&iacute;s interest in achieving stability
for its own sake, the US is prone to define Mediterranean security
in terms of extra-Mediterranean issues and targets, such as the
oil of the Gulf. The continued definition of Mediterranean security
in terms of extra-Mediterranean objectives can foster further
division by competing with the real concerns of Mediterranean
security as defined by Mediterranean countries themselves. Thus
for example, for all the support that Arab governments gave to
the US-led coalition against Iraq in 1991 in the first test case
of the projected &euml;New World Order&iacute;, it is clear that
the hearts and minds of the Arab populations resented the role
of the United States as guardian of international order inside
the Arab world. <BR>

<P>
Which is also to say that the support of such Arab governments
was dependent on their being undemocratic. The question of democracy
indeed is crucial to the future of any working Euro-Mediterranean
relationship, especially in terms of achieving enduring security.
In terms of experience in supporting democratic transition in
the Mediterranean the European Union has a sound record. 
<P>
In the past, Europe&iacute;s approach of encouraging the combination
of democratic transition and economic development in southern
Europe proved to be more far-sighted than that of condoning authoritarian
regimes on the grounds that their anti-communism made Europe&iacute;s
southern flank safer from Soviet penetration. That experience
ought to serve as the basis for dealing with the Arab Mediterranean
countries, which suggests that fearing democracy because it gives
space to Islamic fundamentalists or because it might produce governments
that do not share western values and objectives is short-sighted.
There is no reason why the maxim that democratic countries make
peaceful neighbours should not apply to the Mediterranean also.
<BR>

<P>
Nor should Europe be pusillanimous about pushing for the required
changes in the internal system of government in its neighbours
across the water. For just as Western Europe could not integrate
parts of itself before those parts became democracies, so it cannot
integrate an entire region which denies democracy to its people.
<P>
It would certainly be against the best of European tradition to
try fostering its own security by shoring up regimes that do not
speak for their own people. It is the surest way, not only of
delaying democratic transition in these societies, but of securing
the enduring distrust of such societies. <BR>

<P>
Conversely, while Arab societies can be expected to be suspicious
of a security system concerted by the United States, these same
quarters seek - and indeed, expect - Europe to be more forthcoming
towards them. If any criticism is levelled towards Europe frontier
quarter, it is that the Europeans have not done enough to assist
them, not that the Europeans must keep to their side of the sea.
After all, it is with Europe, even more than with each other,
that they conduct most of their economic business.<BR>

<P>
It would seem therefore that for Euro-Mediterranean security to
achieve a concrete level of co-ordination, the divide that exists
between north and south has to be acknowledged for what it is,
and the causes addressed squarely, in a context of partnership.
In this light, the best model for a Euro-Mediterranean security
structure and framework appears to be the OSCE. From its inception,
this organisation (as the CSCE) addressed a situation of division,acknowledging
that co-operation amongst adversaries generated confidence and
produced security. It was to be expected - though it has not resulted
in practice - that the termination of the Cold War would crown
the CSCE as the ideal pan-European security framework and structure
to help consolidate the peace in the same way as it had earlier
contributed to defuse tensions. Thus, Russia&iacute;s support
for this line of thought stems from the fact that its position
in the CSCE is one of parity with that of its former adversaries,
a logical expectation in a new order to replace the Cold War division
of Europe. The same logic applies to the Euro-Mediterranean situation.
<BR>

<P>
At the time of the East-West divide, it proved impossible, beyond
declarations, to persuade the CSCE to include the non-European
Mediterranean in its scope and thus acknowledge the inseparability
of European and Mediterranean security interests. Proponents of
that line of action argued that security in Europe achieved to
the exclusion of security in the Mediterranean was tantamount
to the former being achieved at the expense of the latter. If
the protagonists of the CSCE then objected to extend the scope
of the Conference because their chief concern was to bridge the
east-west division of Europe, the same reason cannot apply today.
Today, there are clear signs that Europe is taking very seriously
the implications to its own security of problems that could emanate
from the Mediterranean. <BR>

<P>
Replicating the OSCE on a minor scale through regional arrangements,
such as a Conference on Security and Co-operation in the Mediterranean
(CSCM) and similar initiatives, may be a good start as intermediary
measures leading to a more comprehensive approach. But such initiatives
can become meaningless or worse if they are seen as Europe&iacute;s
way of keeping the problems of the Mediterranean at arm&iacute;s
length. Similarly, to be beneficial, initiatives by NATO or the
WEU to involve themselves in Mediterranean problems cannot aim
to compete with the prospects of a more comprehensive partnership.
What the Mediterranean does not need is a myriad of organisations
trying to upstage each other as its security guardians. On the
other hand, adoption of the principle that Euro-Mediterranean
security is one and indivisible on the basis of a full Euro-Mediterranean
partnership would be a confidence-building measure in itself,
given that a relationship of parity has never existed between
the northern and southern shores of the Mediterranean. In short,
a Euro-Mediterranean partnership should be just that.

<B>THE BARCELONA DECLARATION: A PARTNERSHIP LOOKING FOR IMPLEMENTATION
AND IMPROVEMENT<BR>
<BR>
</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Smail HAMDANI, Principal Consultant, <I>Institut
National d'Etudes de Strat&eacute;gie Globale</I>, Algiers</FONT>
<HR>

<P>
Let me, first of all, thank Mr. Alberto Bin and the staff of the
Mediterranean Academy of Diplomatic Studies in Malta, for the
invitation to take part in this colloquium, on co-operation and
security in the Mediterranean, and especially on the prospects
after Barcelona.<BR>

<P>
If, the Barcelona meeting last November was a governmental one,
our gathering today is between private persons. This means, that
the plenipotentiaries in Barcelona were bound, at least in principle,
to defend the point of view of their government and the interests
of their own countries; it's their duty to do so. Conversely,
in our meeting today, whether from the North or the South shore,
we are free of this obligation and we can and must have a certain
vision of the future of the Mediterranean region as a whole.<BR>

<P>
Nevertheless, we cannot say that this document met the requirements
and hopes of the people of the South shore, while it met very
much more those of the North, even if in its appearance and form,
it seems to be equal to both sides.<BR>

<P>
It would take too long to comment on and detail each point of
the Declaration, but we may have a certain reading together. For
the first time in the history of our region, something serious
had begun. For the first time, 15 European countries, including
10 not directly Mediterranean but linked to the area, and 12 Mediterranean,
non-members of the European Union, started to establish a global
Euro-Mediterranean partnership.<BR>

<P>
We must say that the mere meeting in Barcelona and its issues,
is, in itself a very positive step. We must also remember that,
for more than two decades similar attempts to meet, dialogue and
agree, between those we generally call developed countries or
the North and the developing countries or the South, had not succeeded.
<BR>

<P>
It is the hope of all the members to see the implementation of
the decisions taken in Barcelona. It is also the hope of the people
of the South, and maybe their dream too, to see the partnership
as decided last November seriously improved.<BR>

<P>
We should wipe out the perception of many observers from the South
who see that the draft Declaration was shaped by the Europeans,
much more for themselves and in a subsidiary manner for the others.
<BR>

<P>
The common space of peace and stability should be framed by equal
partners through a real political dialogue. Our common security
cannot be divided; the regional security, contrary to yesterday's
confrontation between West and East, is not to substitute South
for East. It lies in a real balance of a dense network of interests,
in an understanding between all our peoples with no one excluded.
In short, it lies in a real and global partnership. Security will
not be ensured by military means or common manoeuvres.
<P>
The chapter related to the economic and financial partnership
stresses, in its first paragraph, the necessity of a lasting and
balanced economic and social development in order to build an
area of shared prosperity. Yet, in the following paragraph, the
Declaration dismisses the debt problem. <BR>

<P>
A real partnership seems to me very difficult to establish while
this problem and in general the question of financial relations
between the North and the South remain unsettled; in other words,
can a partnership, in the equal benefit of both parties, be built
between a &quot;heavy&quot; creditor and his debtor. <BR>

<P>
In the light of this, let's examine the situation of Algeria,
without hiding the responsibility of the national authorities
in the question of the external debt, we cannot also forget the
foreign liability in this matter, as far as the origin of the
debt or its management, are concerned.<BR>

<P>
The brutal fall of the oil price in 86 and of the US dollar (the
account currency), put Algeria in a very difficult situation which
leaded to serious turmoil. Managing its debt, Algeria had to pay
for the period of 3 years, 91, 92 and 93 an amount of 28 billions
$ and received for the same period 19 billions $ of credits (inflow)
with a debt stock of 26 billions $, which meant a net outflow
of 9 billions $ to the creditors, namely 3 billions $ per year,
and the debt of 26 billions $ is still the same; so, you always
have to pay without hope of putting an end to this sea-serpent.
<BR>

<P>
As a consequence of that, in 93, as an example, the country had
to reduce the imports to half of the 85's level, while the population
had grown and the social demand had risen. Besides that, you lose
your ability to negotiate better conditions for your imports;
you pay a higher price for the goods you buy, while the oil price,
the main export product, is at the level it was before 1973. An
exhausting situation with high losses.
<P>
The creditors advised the authorities to make an agreement with
the I.M.F. and reschedule the debt with the so-called Paris Club
and London Club even though one knows that no other country had
settled its debt problem through a rescheduling, in 94 Algeria
was compelled to resort to rescheduling its foreign debt.<BR>

<P>
As a result, the ratio of the debt service went down from 86%
of the exports in 93 to 48.7% in 94 and to 43.1% in 95, and the
debt stock rose from 26 to more than $. 32 billion.<BR>

<P>
This gave some financial ease but it was not sufficient to allow
a real take off of economic development: a normal debt service
should not exceed 25% of exports.<BR>

<P>
The financial &quot;assistance&quot; afforded by E.U. does not
give an adequate solution, the debt trap remains, and you have
to pay again and again.<BR>

<P>
Out of the debt question and out of the tariffs and customs, a
free trade area has other requirements, such as, among other things,
acquiring technology, spreading training and education, mastering
management and know-how, in order to ensure a competitive position
with partners.<BR>

<P>
A free trade area implies better conditions of equal competition,
or at least a competition not too unequal, a competition where
you give and take. Otherwise, it would lead to exploitation, frustration,
and even confrontation.<BR>

<P>
By the way, I would like to say here that I don't agree with the
last statement made in Paris on the 13/2/96 by Sir Leon Brittan
Vice-President of the European Commission who said:
<P>
&quot;It's time to adopt an offensive strategy in favour of opening
markets which are needed by the French economy and in general
by the whole of Europe&quot;. <BR>

<P>
When you read the development on the social, cultural and human
partnership, you're struck by the generous ideas expressed in
the Barcelona Declaration. Despite the mention of some &quot;selfish&quot;
preoccupation, the text is, in itself, of a high level, and we
may say: &quot;there is nothing to add, just put it into practice&quot;.
<BR>

<P>
However, it seems to me important to clarify and improve this
praiseworthy text in some of its aspects:<BR>

<P>
1- Social and cultural development are intimately linked to economic
development;<BR>

<P>
2- Security, democracy, human rights, birth control etc. cannot
be based on poverty. Such achievements can be reached only by
a society with a large middle class; <BR>

<P>
3- As far as the emigration question is concerned, we should,
in my opinion, state some principles and rules:<BR>

<P>
a) the right answer to the unemployment problem does not lie in
emigration but in domestic development. In this regard, Algeria
had in 1973 unilaterally put an end to the policy of emigration.
<BR>

<OL>
<LI>legally established immigrants should be protected; their
protection must be considered as part of human rights. 
</OL>

<P>
c) in this connection, the question of emigrants should not be
used as a wager in a gamble or a kind of punch bag, especially
at the time of electoral campaigns or in domestic policy to hide
some social problems. To do so is to do a great harm to the immigrants,
by exciting against them antiracial feelings and xenophobia.<BR>

<P>
d) full facilities must be given for those who want to be integrated
in the country of immigration. <BR>

<P>
4- Finally, if we want really to favour understanding between
cultures and exchanges among our peoples around the Mediterranean,
we must give each other facilities to travel and meet; we should
avoid erecting what appears to be a &quot;citadel Europe&quot;.
<BR>

<P>
It symbolically fitting for the colloquium to be held here in
Malta, in the very centre of the Mediterranean Sea. Malta has
taken from both North and South, even in its language. By the
way, why is Malta considered European? Isn't she African? In fact
she is both European and African, i.e. she is Mediterranean.<BR>

<P>
From such a Mediterranean place, I would like, in conclusion,
to call also for a real dialogue of religions, cultures and civilisations,
to know each other much more, to understand and admit our differences.
That would be fruitful for both sides, North and South. We should
not think to reproduce a unique cultural model, and we have to
keep our own identity and to be in the meantime open to other
cultures in a spirit of tolerance. That's the Mediterranean spirit.

Now that the Barcelona Conference has taken place and the final
declaration has been made, the South Mediterranean states that
were involved will have time to consider at leisure precisely
what it is that they have agreed to. Four of them - Turkey, Israel,
Tunisia and Morocco - already know the detailed terms of their
new economic relationship with Europe and at least two others
- Egypt and Algeria - are busy laying the groundwork for their
future links with the states of the European Union. Indeed, it
is the economic component of the future relationship which is
the most immediate and which is likely to have the most powerful
impact on the states concerned, for, in reality, the Barcelona
Conference was merely the framework for introducing Europe's new
Global Euro-Mediterranean Partnership policy which is essentially
economic in nature. The crucial question that they will have to
answer is whether the policy to which they have adhered will produce
genuine partnership or simply prolong economic dependence.<BR>

<P>
<B>The past<BR>
</B>
<P>
It is a truism to point out that the states of the southern Mediterranean,
except for Turkey, were all subject to colonial occupation and
that this had powerful effects on their economic development.
The effects are most strikingly seen in the Maghrib, where the
region's integration into the French colonial sphere meant that
economic structures were increasingly dedicated to serving the
metropolitan market. At the same time, these colonial economies
were divided into traditional subsistence sectors and modern,
capital-intensive sectors which were oriented towards the markets
of Europe, principally France. These changes caused profound modifications
in indigenous economic behaviour, such as the switch from hard
to soft wheat production in North Africa as Maghribi economies
became integrated into the European and American wheat markets,
or the destruction of handicraft industries in the wake of the
Great Depression and the growth of competing imports from Japan
in the 1930s. Even after Independence, this dependence of Mediterranean
economies on the European market continued, with the effect being
most profoundly marked in North Africa but extending into the
Mashriq as well.<BR>

<P>
The dependence was, to some extent, codified by the advent of
the Association and Co-operation Agreements with the European
Common Market after 1969. These agreements essentially sought
to provide for free entry into Europe of industrial goods and
minerals into Europe, as provided for in the Treaty of Rome, but
tried to regulate entry of agricultural goods by tariff barriers
designed to ensure that European and South Mediterranean produce
competed on equal terms inside the European market and thus did
not threaten the Common Agricultural Policy which was one of the
cornerstones of Franco-German co-operation. The European Commission
hoped that the agreements, which were bilateral in nature and
which were renewed in the mid-1970s and again in the mid-1980s,
would provide a breathing space in which the economies of the
South Mediterranean region would re-orient their export priorities
away from the European market and thus bring the delayed effects
of colonialism to an end.<BR>

<P>
In reality, of course, the reverse was true, for finding new markets
for agricultural produce of the kind that Mediterranean states
had to offer was difficult. Either their goods were not competitive,
given the transport costs - as was the case with citrus - or they
were unwanted because of local tastes and preferences. Despite
the tariff barriers, which removed their competitive advantage,
Europe did at least offer a secure market so that South Mediterranean
governments became increasingly concerned about creating fairer
terms of trade. The same was true of industrial goods where the
growing amount of textiles produced in the region had both to
compete with even cheaper produce from Asia and the Indian sub-continent
and faced discrimination because of the threat it offered to European
industry. They were excluded from the Staflex agreements that
applied outside the Mediterranean region but were required to
abide by a series of &quot;voluntary restraint agreements&quot;
instead. Once again, however, the lure of the European market
was irresistible because of its size and because it was so close.
<P>
The issue of agricultural trade became acute, however, in 1986,
when Spain and Portugal began a ten year economic transitional
regime as part of their entry into the European Common Market.
Europe was now more than self-sufficient in all the agricultural
produce that had originally come from North Africa and the Middle
East. This was particularly true of citrus, olive oil and early
vegetables. As a result, the agricultural import regime was modified
so that, by the end of the transitional regime, South Mediterranean
produce would be subjected to quota restrictions, rather than
tariff constraints. As far as North Africa was concerned, the
problem was that the quotas were based on average export levels
between 1980 and 1984 - which were years of drought! A special
arrangement had to be made to accommodate Tunisia's massive olive
oil production and separate arrangements covered Community fishing
in Moroccan waters - 740 out of 900 Spanish fishing boats from
Southern Spain depended on such access.<BR>

<P>
At the same time, there were growing anxieties in Europe over
the implications of demographic change in the South Mediterranean
region. Migration had long been a problem for certain European
states and the 4.3 million Muslim migrants within the 10 million
migrant workers in Europe came in their majority from the South
Mediterranean region, 2.6 million of them from the Maghreb alone.
The apparently constantly accelerating birth-rates in the region
only underlined the danger of migration if the countries concerned
did not succeed in maximising economic growth. Yet this appeared
to be an unlikely outcome for three decades of independence had
been marked by progressive economic failure and the growth of
foreign debt, particularly after 1973. As the European Commission
pointed out in 1993, &quot;It is difficult to avoid the conclusion
that the economy of the region is a failure.&quot; Although the
document in question referred to the Middle East, very similar
conclusions had been reached a year earlier in a similar analysis
of the Maghreb. <BR>

<P>
<B>The prescription<BR>
</B>
<P>
By the 1990s, the issue of official development assistance was
increasingly seen in Europe as an inappropriate means of reviving
economic growth and new weight was put on the process of attracting
foreign investment. In essence, the economic problems of the South
Mediterranean littoral states were seen as the consequence of
inappropriate resource allocation, caused by unrealistic pricing
policies . The Washington Consensus, accepted by the World Bank
and the IMF was seen as the appropriate remedy, with trade liberalisation
and the reduction of the state sector in the economy as the key.
The change in European policy towards the South Mediterranean
littoral that began to be considered at this time therefore bore
the hallmarks of neo-classical economics which were to achieve
pre-eminence in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union after
the Communist system collapsed in 1989-1991. At the same time,
the Commission also had to deal with growing unease in the southern
part of Europe that investment flows within the European Community
were increasingly flowing eastward, rather than towards the south.
The result has been the new Global Euro-Mediterranean Partnership
policy which was formally introduced in Barcelona in November
1995. In economic terms, the new policy seeks both to equilibrate
aid flows eastward and southwards and to stimulate indigenous
economic growth through economic restructuring and exposure to
free market competition. It also recognises that there is an essential
inter-dependence between the regions on each side of the Mediterranean
and that Europe cannot afford simply to ignore the very real problems
facing the South Mediterranean region.
<P>
In fact, Europe - essentially the fifteen states which now make
up the European Union - cannot simply ignore the region for reasons
connected with its own regional interests as well. It is heavily
dependent on the Middle East and North African region in terms
of energy supplies, for nearly 60 per cent of its needs in hydrocarbon
supplies come from there. In 1993, The Middle East supplied 32.6
per cent of Europe's requirements in oil (43.2 per cent of oil
imports), whilst North Africa supplied a further 14.6 per cent
(19.3 per cent of oil imports). In terms of natural gas, Algeria
and Libya alone supplied 19.4 per cent of European gas demand,
with a further 6 per cent to be supplied by the new Algeria-Spain
gas pipeline via Morocco which will be completed in June 1996,
bringing the total up to one quarter of Europe's natural gas import
needs. In this context, it is worth noting that, since it is the
Gulf region which is the major supplier of oil to Europe within
the overall region, it is difficult to consider Mediterranean
economic circumstances without including the Gulf as a part of
the Mediterranean region itself. Nonetheless, the problems that
face the littoral states are quite different from those of the
Gulf states and they will therefore be excluded from this discussion.
<BR>

<P>
At the same time, the importance of the Middle East and North
African region to Europe, from an economic point of view, should
not be over-stressed. In 1993 the region only supplied 8.1 per
cent of all Europe's imports and absorbed 7 per cent of Europe's
imports. However, in terms of the region itself, Europe was by
far the most important trade partner it possessed, as Table (1)
demonstrates. In 1992, for example, the twelve-member European
Union supplied 47.1 per cent of the region's import requirements
and absorbed 38.3 per cent of its exports. No other region of
the world even approaches these proportions, a consideration which
underlines the essentially asymmetrical trading relationship between
the Middle East and Europe. It is a relationship which, furthermore,
reflects historical as well as modern economic links and cannot,
for both these reasons, be ignored.<BR>

<B>The critique<BR>
</B>
<P>
The South Mediterranean region is thus highly dependent on its
relationship with Europe and this dependency has tended to increase,
not weaken, over recent years. Littoral states, in particular,
are acutely aware of the real nature of the relationship, as the
primacy given to their economic links with Europe indicates. Certain
European states, too - particularly those in Southern Europe -
are also very concerned by these factors as well. Overall, however,
European concern is conditioned by two factors; firstly dependence
on the region and its hinterland for oil and gas supplies and
secondly over the implications of economic decline within the
South Mediterranean and Middle Eastern region. This, in turn,
is closely connected with demographic growth patterns in the South
Mediterranean region, for these demonstrate that past and future
economic failure is linked to the demands on resources made by
expanding populations and that, unless these are met, Europe faces
the danger of uncontrolled and expanding immigration.<BR>

National economies in the South Mediterranean will have to grow
at a rate of at least 6 per cent per annum in real terms simply
to contain these massive populations, which are admittedly now
growing more slowly than suggested by the figures above. However,
even at projected growth rates of between 2.0 and 2.8 per cent
per year, they will still almost double by the year 2050, as shown
in Table (3), . Any lower rate of economic growth will not permit
governments to provide essential education, health and housing
services, nor to create sufficient employment to absorb a predominantly
young population. Even now, unemployment rates are between 10
and 30 per cent throughout the region and under-employment rates
can range as high as 50 per cent of the labour force. <BR>

The problem is that the current approved development model being
proposed to these states, in line with the &quot;Washington Consensus&quot;,
does little to deal with these social demands created by demography.
It may well improve macro-economic performance but it does virtually
nothing for micro-economic considerations which are the very factors
that influence social and political unrest. Certain sectors of
the reconstructed economy may well experience export-led growth,
but these sectors and their success have little effect on the
distribution of national wealth for the &quot;trickle-down&quot;
effect takes a long time to percolate outside such sectors - if,
indeed, it ever does do so.<BR>

<P>
The result is that the economies in question either remain stagnant
or see living standards progressively worsen. In addition, unless
there are significant competitive advantages, foreign investment
is not attracted and the export-led growth will tend to be either
in traditional exports - raw materials or agricultural goods -
or in low valued-added manufactures which tend to feed into the
production processes in metropolitan markets.<BR>

<P>
In any case, as far as the South Mediterranean states are concerned,
what export earnings are achieved have tended, in the past, to
be absorbed into debt repayment. Only Israel, because of its special
relationship with the United States, which is its major creditor,
and Tunisia have escaped this problem, whilst Libya falls outside
the discussion because of its status as a centrally-controlled
oil producer which depends virtually entirely on its oil rent
to pay for essential imports. 
<P>
This consideration has been particularly important for countries
such as Algeria and Morocco, where debt service ratios have been
very high and, without debt rescheduling operations, essential
import requirements could not have been satisfied. 
<P>
In essence, however, the cost of servicing foreign debt, plays
a critical role in delaying, if not annulling, the supposed benefits
of economic restructuring.<BR>

<P>
<B>Exogenous causes of failure<BR>
</B>
<P>
There is, however, a further, more basic problem with the &quot;Washington
Consensus&quot;. This is that it takes no account of the exogenous
influences on the economy, seeing its problems as being purely
endogamous in nature, even though it relies on exogenous factors
to correct them. Inevitably, such economic restructuring causes
considerable social disruption and, on occasion, impoverishment.
The external environment is often hostile towards national economic
development and, since it is the environment in which national
exports must compete, it can nullify the supposedly beneficial
effects of the proposed reforms which are designed to improve
international competitivity. In addition, compression of foreign
exchange earnings not only hinders debt repayment but also causes
compression of vital imports. The consequence is that the restructuring
process can be significantly lengthened as a result of such external
factors and the social disruption caused is thereby intensified.
Indeed, the goal of the restructuring process may become virtually
unattainable for these reasons.<BR>

<P>
A good example of this process is provided by the Algerian experience
of the mid-1980s. This was a time when the Algerian regime was
attempting to introduce state-directed and gradual economic liberalisation.
The sudden Saudi-induced drop in world oil prices in 1986 came,
therefore, at a critical juncture. The sudden worsening of its
foreign exchange position - the decline in nominal oil prices
combined with a simultaneous depreciation of the dollar, the currency
in which oil prices are denominated, produced a 20 per cent decline
in foreign currency receipts in an economy which was a high capital
absorber - seriously affected import supply and the debt service
ratio which, by 1992 had climbed to a terrifying 72 per cent.
Of course, the resultant crisis was also of the regime's own making;
it did not seek rescheduling fast enough and refused to accept
the need for significant and specific economic restructuring.
Nonetheless, the external environment did nothing to ease its
predicament and played a significant role in creating the conditions
for the October 1988 riots. A similar pattern of social unrest
leading to widescale rioting has marked the economic restructuring
programmes of Tunisia (January 1984), Morocco (June 1981, January
1984 and December 1990), Egypt (1976 and 1986) and Jordan (1990).
<BR>

<P>
Indeed, all South Mediterranean states except Algeria and Libya
run significant trade deficits and thus depend on other sources
to provide the financial flows essential to make up the balance
of payments. Of these the most important is workers' remittances
and, despite its growing unpopularity with donor countries, official
development assistance still plays a role. Direct private foreign
investment, although it has grown in importance in Morocco and
Tunisia, has declined markedly in Egypt, from $1.25 billion in
1989 to an estimated $530 million in 1994. Yet, even in Morocco
and Tunisia, levels of private foreign investment are static at
around $500-$550 million for the former and $270-$300 million
for the latter. Portfolio investment has not, so far, played a
significant role at all, although the current privatisation programmes
in many South Mediterranean countries may alter this, particularly
when privatisation operations occur through local stock exchanges.

Yet, quite apart from the lack of internally-sustained patterns
of development based on investment, there are other objective
factors which hamper economic development in the region as well,
and which relate directly to European attitudes towards the South
Mediterranean region. Not least is the growing inaccessibility
of Western European labour markets to the South Mediterranean
region, so that excess labour there can neither be soaked up nor
generate further remittance flows, as in the past. There is also
the growing problem for agricultural exporters created by the
barriers within Europe to their produce - most recently underlined
by the particularly mean-minded dispute over cut-flower and tomato
exports to Europe from Morocco in october 1995. In part, of course,
this reflects the fact that Europe is now virtually self-sufficient
in all aspects of agricultural production and is no longer prepared
to honour export patterns established in colonial times, particularly
as far as early vegetables, olive oil and citrus are concerned.
As mentioned above, this is translated into quota and tariff restrictions
under the Common Agricultural Policy which particularly affect
Israel, Morocco, Tunisia and Egypt. Israel is less severely affected,
as it has already begun to cut back on agricultural exports for
reasons of restricted water access. 
<P>
The import restrictions have acquired a new importance since the
start of 1996 for Spanish and Portuguese integration into the
European Market is now complete and the new quota arrangements
come into force to replace the old reference price system of tariff
barriers to South Mediterranean agricultural exports.<BR>

<P>
Ironically enough, the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round
of the GATT, which was signed in Marrakesh in 1994, also has negative
connotations for the South Mediterranean region. Although world
trade was expected to rise by some $512 billion (some estimates
spoke of $572 billion), sub-Saharan Africa and North Africa were
expected to be net losers - with North Africa losing up to $600
million annually. The Middle East would gain by $1.2 million annually
- although virtually all of this would accrue to the Gulf oil
producers. One of the main reasons for the losses involved cereal
imports which, under the reduced GATT tariff levels (with Europe
removing 30 per cent of its subsidies) would undercut local prices
which were supported. These imports are not insignificant: in
the 1984-86 period, for example, Morocco produced an average of
5 million tons each year and imported 2.2 million tons; Algeria
produced 2.9 million tons and imported 3.9 million tons; and Tunisia,
which produced 1.2 million tons annually, imported a similar amount.
Little has happened since then to alter the basic situation. Overall,
the region imports 50 per cent of its cereal requirements and
is extremely sensitive to external prices. This translates into
a wider sensitivity to falling tariffs in the wider world and
the World Bank has calculated that South Mediterranean trade with
Europe will be severely affected by the GATT regulations, falling
by $5.5 billion annually - unless the region is integrated into
Europe.<BR>

<P>
<B>Endogamous factors<BR>
</B>
<P>
At the same time, there is little doubt that most of the South
Mediterranean economies need economic reform: their chronic budget,
trade and current account deficits make this clear, as does their
dismal growth record over the years. Public sector involvement
in their economies has traditionally been high - 70 per cent in
Algeria, 40 per cent in Tunisia, Morocco and Egypt up to the 1980s,
for example, which often contributed significantly to their heavy
budget deficits. Failure to achieve adequate export levels has
meant that, except for the Libyan oil economy, foreign trade balances
have usually been negative and this has contributed to indebtedness,
as foreign exchange to pay for imports has been lacking. It is
for this reason that workers remittances and tourist revenues
have been essential in reducing current account deficits, with
capital inflows being the only way in which the balance of payments
has usually been maintained for most of the non-oil exporting
economies. <BR>

One consequence of such deficits, particularly in the external
account, has been to reduce public sector investment, with concomitant
reductions in economic development rates. This has been particularly
serious in terms of the development of human resources. The persisting
problems of adult illiteracy, despite decades of heavy investment
in education, indicates the level of the failure they have experienced
in exploiting their human resources - which ultimately determine
any sustained development process, as the experience of South-East
Asia makes clear. There improving levels of education went hand-in-hand
with low labour costs and government strategic involvement in
achieving and maintaining development. In the South Mediterranean
region, however, even if the necessary employment could be created,
there are not the necessary skilled workers to satisfy demand.
In any case, many of the more enterprising elements of the workforce
migrate to Europe or to the Gulf.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=2>** In total investment terms, South Asia outstrips
the Middle East!<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
Quite apart from the issue of human resources, the majority of
South Mediterranean countries also suffer from inadequate physical
infrastructure. This, combined with ill-trained and nobody motivated
work-forces, seriously hinders access to direct private foreign
investment, which is now considered to be the crucial motor for
economic development, once satisfactory economic restructuring
has been achieved. 
<P>
Here, however, the South Mediterranean region has been a manifest
failure, as Table (7) demonstrates, coming just above South Asia
- the lowest ranking region in the developing world in terms of
access to direct private foreign investment. 
<P>
This is a staggering position, given the potential of the South
Mediterranean region and its closeness to a major world market.
It reflects, in part, the Western perception of chronic political
instability within the region and the inadequacy of infrastructural,
financial, human and legal resources to persuade investors that
investment prospects are good. It also reflects the anxieties
of indigenous investors over the region's potential. 
<P>
Around $465 billion-worth of Arab private investment is located
outside the Middle East-North Africa region, rather than within
it! It also highlights the levels of development that will be
needed if the region is ever to attract the investment it needs
to be able to realise the growth rates that are essential if the
demographic problems its faces are to be contained. 
<P>
However, as described above, this can only be done with the aid
of external assistance, a consideration that makes the economic
relations of the region with Europe of crucial importance, particularly
as official development assistance levels are static or declining
- in accordance with the &quot;Washington Consensus&quot; - for
it will be Europe that will be the only source of the essential
foreign investment for macro-economic recovery, whatever happens
at the micro-economic level.<BR>

<B>The Euro-Mediterranean Partnership<BR>
</B>
<P>
It is considerations such as these that make the conclusions of
the Barcelona Conference so important for the South Mediterranean
Region. The decision to offer industrial free trade area arrangements
on a bilateral basis to individual South Mediterranean states
as part of a new set of Association Agreements was the first step
in this process. The proposal to merge such agreements into a
multilateral southward extension of the European Economic Area
is the second. The third will be to renegotiate both the restrictions
on agricultural trade, to free it from the limitations of the
Common Agricultural Policy and bring it into the free trade ambit
- which the European Commission has agreed to consider - and to
reconsider the restrictions on the free movement of people, to
parallel that of goods and services. This is most unlikely in
the near future, despite the fact that the European labour force
is ageing and will not accept unskilled and semi-skilled work.
<BR>

<P>
The explicit objective of these new proposals - and the new types
of bilateral agreements have already been signed by Tunisia, Israel
and Morocco, with Turkey obtaining its own customs union agreement
and Egypt and Algeria seeking to imitate their Maghribi partners
- is to provide a basis for accelerated economic growth, so that
increased migration will not be necessary. There is also the belief
that economic improvement will reduce domestic political instability
and thus increase access to direct private foreign investment
and to portfolio investment - which is now just beginning. It
has to be said, however, that the basic structural problems still
remain and the costs of integration may prove to be very high
indeed.<BR>

<P>
Despite the new institutional arrangements, there is still little
to encourage the private foreign investor. Physical, institutional
and human resource infrastructure is still weak and will take
many years to change. Current policies of reducing public sector
involvement in the economy will in any case slow down change,
particularly if the private sector is not prepared to pick up
the gauntlet. In addition, the costs of coping with adjustment
to the new free trade areas is likely to be severe, despite the
twelve year transition periods proposed (most South Mediterranean
countries would have sought a fifteen year transition period,
but the Commission is not prepared to tolerate this). Tunisia
has estimated that 2,000 companies will disappear and 2,000 other
may be similarly threatened, whilst a further 2,000 companies
will face difficulties. It is seeking $2.2 billion for the costs
of transition designed to avoid the kind of industrial crisis
it anticipates, up to 80 per cent of which will have to come from
foreign sources. Morocco anticipates that, without significant
help, up to 60 per cent of its industrial base could be destroyed
by European competition and that up to Dh45 billion ($5.6 billion)
will be required to cover the costs of the transition.
<P>
Of course, the situation will never be as bad as portrayed. It
is, however, clear that significant increases in foreign aid will
be necessary to achieve the structural adjustment necessary if
the new free trade area policy is to produce the desired result.
In this connection, the doubling of European Union aid in the
next Five Year Financial Protocol to Ecu4.67 billion, with a similar
amount being made available in the form of soft aid and concessionary
loans, does not seem to be very generous, since it represents
only Ecu2 billion annually for the whole of the South Mediterranean
region. It is difficult to avoid the conclusion, however, that
without significant amounts of additional official development
assistance, given the relative failure of direct private foreign
investment, the damage done in the medium term to the economies
of the South Mediterranean region may well outweigh the longer
term benefits, if any do accrue.<BR>

<P>
<B>Conclusion<BR>
</B>
<P>
The net result of the new proposals, in short, may not resolve
the developmental crisis facing the South Mediterranean region.
The Maghrib and the Mashriq, however, have no real alternative.
Without sufficient assistance to undertake and complete the essential
infrastructural tasks they face - and this must be provided from
outside the region, either from private or public sources - they
cannot anticipate the economic growth rates needed to deal with
their demographic crisis and achieved sustained development. In
addition, without appropriate protection during the transition
periods, it is likely that export patterns will never be transformed
into high valued-added goods of the kind that would allow South
Mediterranean economies to compete on more equal terms with Europe.
Furthermore, the continued exclusion of South Mediterranean migrants
from the European labour market, despite the anticipated shortfall
in indigenous labour supply by the third decade of the next century,
is bound to damage the creation of economic symmetry across the
Mediterranean basin. Instead, the Tunisian and Maltese experience
of off-shore production for European industry, based on differential
wage rate advantages, may become the norm and thus institutionalise
regional economic asymmetry within the European geo-economic zone.

<P>
The alternative to genuine economic partnership may well therefore
be that the states of the Southern Mediterranean littoral simply
become satellite economies of Europe, so that balanced, self-sustained
growth there will become no more than a distant, unattainable
dream.

<P>
First of all, allow me to say a few words about the Council of
Europe. It is the oldest European institution, created in 1949
with the aim to &quot;achieve a greater unity between its Members
for the purpose of safeguarding and realising the ideals and principles
which are their common heritage and facilitating their economic
and social progress&quot; (art. 1a of the Statute of the Council
of Europe).<BR>

<P>
To become a member of the Council a country must accept the principles
of the rule of law and the protection of human rights and meet
the requirements of genuine pluralistic parliamentary democracy.
Within the Council of Europe the respect of the rights of minorities
has also become an important aspect of human rights protection.
<BR>

<P>
Since the accession of Russia on 28 February 1996, our Organisation
counts 39 member States. It is expected that in the coming years
the Council will group all the European countries, thus becoming
a truly pan-European organisation. Moreover, in December 1995
the United States obtained observer status with the Council of
Europe, and Canada and Japan have applied for similar status.
<BR>

<P>
Co-operation in the Mediterranean has been a long-standing feature
of the Council of Europe's activities. However, this co-operation
has until now benefited mainly the Mediterranean member States.
We would have to go a long time back in history to trace the beginning
of our activities on behalf of the Mediterranean countries. Let
me cite, as an example, the creation in 1962 - on the initiative
of the Council of Europe and the OECD - of the International Centre
for Advanced Mediterranean Agronomic Studies, the main purpose
of which is to provide complementary training of technical and
scientific staff in agriculture and development.<BR>

<P>
As far as the Parliamentary Assembly is concerned, it has focused
much attention on environmental issues, proposing several actions
designed to combat the deteriorating environmental situation.
This has led, among other things to the 1975 Treaty of Barcelona
on the protection of the Mediterranean sea, a UN initiative signed
by almost all Mediterranean member States of the Council of Europe,
to an information campaign of the &quot;Centre for documentation
and information on the Environment and Nature&quot; between 1988
and 1991, and to the launching in 1991 of the &quot;Blue Europe&quot;
programme on the elaboration of a pan-European policy on the management
of water resources. <BR>

<P>
The Parliamentary Assembly has organised four major Mediterranean
conferences in Co-operation with the Congress of Local and Regional
Authorities of Europe. The first such Conference was held in Marseille
in 1985 and adopted the Declaration of Marseille, focusing on
the elaboration of several proposals for the resolution of the
environmental problems and the institutionalisation of the dialogue
between the two shores of the Mediterranean. The second, held
in Malaga in 1987, led to a final declaration covering the questions
of tourism, transport and communication in the Mediterranean basin,
and the means to reinforcing interregional co-operation. In 1993
the third Conference of Mediterranean regions was held in Taormina
and the main subjects dealt with were the promotion of dialogue
between the two Mediterranean shores, co-operation in the field
of democracy and human rights in order to guarantee the &quot;Democratic
security in the Mediterranean&quot;, as well as in the field of
environment and immigration. Finally, the fourth Conference was
held in Cyprus in 1995 and focused on the &quot;sustainable development
in the Mediterranean Basin: environment, demography and migrations&quot;,
underlining for the member states of the Council of Europe, the
importance of including North-South co-operation in their Mediterranean
policy and, by means of regional and local authorities and NGOs,
promoting intercultural dialogue, tolerance and the integration
of immigrants in their societies. The fifth Conference is planned
to be held in Languedoc-Roussillon, in 1997.<BR>

<P>
A Parliamentary hearing on co-operation in the Mediterranean is
scheduled to be held in Thessaloniki on 27 May 1996.<BR>

<P>
On the Intergovernmental side, the Council of Europe and the Greek
Ministry of Regional Planning are organising a Seminar in Athens
on 25 and 27 April 1996 on the subject of &quot;The Challenges
facing European Society with the Approach of the Year 2000: Strategies
for the sustainable development of European States in the Mediterranean
Basin&quot; in preparation for the Conference of European ministers
responsible for regional planning, to be held in Cyprus in 1997.
<BR>

<P>
The Council of Europe has also paid much attention to political,
economic and immigration issues in the Mediterranean. <BR>

<P>
One major point of concern has been the conflict over Cyprus.
Whereas a solution to this problem must be found under the a egis
of the Secretary General of the United Nations, the Council of
Europe has closely followed the situation, devoted much energy
and time to efforts of reconciliation and to making constructive
proposals for a solution [cf. Recommendation 1259 (1995) and Resolution
1054 (1995) of Parliamentary Assembly on the situation in Cyprus
-recent political developments]. The Assembly's Rapporteur, Lord
Finsberg, very recently visited Cyprus in preparation of new proposals,
in support of the UN's Secretary General's proposals on a bi-communal
structure, to be presented to the Parliamentary Assembly in June
1996.<BR>

<P>
The second major problem is the instability in the Middle-East
over the Palestinian question. The Assembly has made great efforts
to promote the peace process through visits and goodwill missions
and by fostering contacts between the Israelis and the Palestinians.
This led in 1993 to the adoption of the Recommendation 1221 and
the Resolution 1013 on the Peace Process in the Middle-East.<BR>

<P>
As a result of this initiative, both Mr Yitzhak Rabin and Mr Yasser
Arafat addressed our Assembly on 26 January and 13 April 1994
respectively. More recently, the Assembly has set up five Task
Forces on economic reconstruction and development, youth and education,
local democracy, democratic institution-building, and human rights,
the judiciary and the penitentiary in the Middle -East in order
to prepare a major assembly debate on the peace process next June.
In the meantime, three Task Forces have held their first meetings
with the participation of Israeli, Palestinian and European delegations.
<BR>

<P>
The third major challenge to Europe consists in creating better
co-operation with the countries of the Southern Mediterranean.
In this connection I would like to draw your attention to the
Assembly's work in favour of a better intercultural and interreligious
understanding, which led to the adoption of Resolution 885 (1991)
and 1202 (1993). 
<P>
In Vienna, at the summit meeting of Heads of State and Governments
of the Council of Europe member States, it was declared that &quot;the
deepening of Co-operation in order to take account of the new
European situation should in no way divert us from our responsibilities
regarding North-South interdependence and stability&quot;. In
this spirit, Europe has a responsibility towards the countries
of the Southern littoral, which are not eligible to join the Council
of Europe or the European Union. The Committee of Ministers is
fully aware both that the future of these nearby countries has
a vital bearing on Europe's democratic security and stability
and that it is essential to promote their political, economic,
social and cultural development, in order to contribute to a greater
respect for human rights. For these reasons, the Committee of
Ministers decided, among other things, to set up a working party
of Ambassadors in order to follow up the Parliamentary Assembly's
Recommendation 1249 (1994) on &quot;Co-operation in the Mediterranean
basin&quot;. This group, which is chaired by Dr. Buttigieg Scicluna,
the Ambassador of Malta, has identified a number of areas where
the development of the Council of Europe's relations with the
Mediterranean countries seem potentially useful. The main areas
are: the establishment of democratic institutions, the promotion
of the rule of law and human rights, including minority rights
and equality between women and men, emigration, the fight against
drug-trafficking and drug-use, action against racism and intolerance,
as well as the environment and the common cultural heritage.<BR>

<P>
This contribution also identified a number of Council of Europe
conventions and partial agreements open to accession by non-member
countries and likely to be of interest for the purposes of Mediterranean
co-operation. These concern culture, the environment and wildlife,
and the legal field. Moreover it was proposed that Mediterranean
non-member States could benefit from the accession to two partial
agreements of the Council of Europe, that is to say the &quot;Open
Partial Agreement on the prevention of, protection against, and
organisation of relief in, major natural and technological disasters&quot;
and the one on &quot;the European Centre for Global Interdependence
and Solidarity&quot; or more poignantly referred to as &quot;the
North-South Centre&quot; of the Council of Europe.<BR>

<P>
This Centre could indeed become one of the focal points for Mediterranean
co-operation. For this purpose, the Centre has already set up
a Transmed Programme which includes a youth programme, co-operation
between the media, the setting up of an information system on
Internet for the Mediterranean called Medgate, confidence-building
measures in the Middle-East, cultural exchanges, and co-operation
with organisations of local and regional authorities. In fact,
the initiative for the Transmed activities was taken at the &quot;international
Symosium on Trans-Mediterranean Interdependence and Partnership&quot;,
organised by the North-South Centre in Rome in 1994.<BR>

<P>
For the future I can see three major lines of action. <BR>

<P>
Firstly, the Parliamentary Assembly will continue to play an essential
role in promoting co-operation and political dialogue in the Mediterranean
area. This concerns in particular the Eastern part of the Mediterranean
and the Middle-East. The Assembly will not accept the non-respect
by any member State of the fundamental principles and values of
the Council of Europe in respect of human rights, democracy and
the rule of law. It will also seek to foster a dialogue with the
non-member States on the Southern shore. In this respect, I refer
to the recent participation of the Speaker of the Egyptian Parliament
in the Assembly, when he underlined that: 
<P>
&quot;Europe as a shrine of democracy has on its shoulders double
responsibility, one is internal, and the other is external toward
its Southern neighbours&quot;.<BR>

<P>
Secondly, the Council of Europe could contribute to the implementation
of the Declaration adopted by the Euro-Mediterranean Conference
held in Barcelona in November 1995, in specific fields of its
competence such as culture, education, human rights, immigration,
and the fight against intolerance, xenophobia and racism.<BR>

<P>
Thirdly, increased co-operation among the Mediterranean countries
could be fostered by the North-South Centre.<BR>

<P>
However such existing or new forms of co-operation are contingent
on the political will on all sides, and on whether or not stability
and peace can be maintained in the more troubled parts of the
Mediterranean. <BR>

<P>
In all events, the Council of Europe's contribution will have
to be modest in financial terms, but may be very significant in
political terms. One cannot underestimate the vital role of the
Council of Europe in maintaining and strengthening human rights,
democracy and the rule of law in its member States and its effects
on the Council's immediate neighbours. The need for improved forms
of Europe-Mediterranean co-operation exist. The Council of Europe's
efforts can only act as a catalyst. They will have an effect only
if made in conjunction with the political will and development
efforts of all the Mediterranean partners.

<B>EUROPEAN SECURITY AND THE MEDITERRANEAN<BR>
<BR>
</B>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Guido LENZI</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>, Director,
Institute for Security Studies, Western European Union, Paris</FONT>
<HR>

<P>
Here in Malta, a few months ago, we heard President Arafat state
that &quot;security is a way of life&quot; : an important recognition
of the new international attitude in the post-Cold War era, where
confrontation and ideological intransigence have given way to
participation, co-operation and compromise. International security
has undergone radical changes, not only in posture but also in
mentality. Deepening and enlargement are the two directions of
the systemic change that is underway in Europe, with the intent
of projecting security eastward in Mitteleuropa, but also southward
in the Mediterranean. The Barcelona conference, which established
the Euro-Mediterranean partnership, mentioned security only in
its preventive aspects, political and diplomatic, assuming that
the relevant co-operative defence mechanisms would follow suit.
They now have to be addressed openly, without the ambiguities
and misunderstandings of the past.<BR>

<P>
The OSCE established European security mechanisms, which evolved
after the fall of the Wall. Are they suitable for the whole Mediterranean?
And if not, what adjustments could be made to satisfy regional
specificities? The first step can only be broader transparency
and dialogue. Barcelona set a similar framework and method, embracing
the whole region, regardless of the obvious local differences
of situations and perceptions. Security as such was kept aside,
on hold, until other practical prerequisites are in place. The
field should be opened before it can be leveld, and multifaceted
interconnections established, as a prerequisite for transparency,
mutual understanding and trust.<BR>

<P>
In Europe and elsewhere, defence is no longer so much a matter
of territorial defence, but rather of co-operative endeavours,
along the lines drawn by the WEU &quot;common concept&quot;, by
the new &quot;enlargement concept&quot; of NATO, and by OSCE behavioural
principles. This requires, in each country, North and South, not
only more specific commitments and training for peace support
operations, but mainly a more extensive information of public
and parliamentary opinions, to ensure the support that is necessary
for consistency, political sustainability and financing purposes.
<BR>

<P>
This presupposes a more coherent multilateral context, in which
national production of and contribution to security is as important
as the consumption of it, from which many benefitted in the fifty
years under the bipolar stalemate. Furthermore, the new multi-dimensional
and transnational challenges produce at the same time a globalisation
and a fragmentation of the responses. The erosion of state authority
under the pressure of the most varied &quot;self-determinations&quot;
can only be restored by international co-operative endeavours,
in many fields that were up to now the preserve of sovereign national
prerogatives.<BR>

<P>
Today, once a crisis has erupted, it is difficult to intervene,
contain and reabsorb. Prevention and mediatory interposition is
the name of the new game, which implies also interventions in
internal affairs. The UN itself, after the experiences of Somalia
and Bosnia, with their mixture of Chapter 6 and Chapter 7 of the
Charter, is not willing to engage directly in peace enforcement
any more, and will increasingly rely on regional arrangements
duly mandated under the provisions of Chapter 8. Sub-regional
aggregation and agreements are therefore indispensable for stability
and security purposes, which external interventions can only supplement,
not substitute. Especially in the many so-called &quot;out-of-area&quot;
contingencies, ad hoc mechanisms by the &quot;willing and able&quot;
are the most adequate to adjust to the shifting and unforeseeable
combinations and variable factors. Variable geometries and hard
cores apply to every country, whether it already belongs or aspires
to European security architectures (which should in itself dispel
any misperception of a Western hegemonic fortress).<BR>

<P>
This is how things stand in continental Europe. The same principles
and mechanisms should apply to the areas contiguous to it, first
and foremost to the Mediterranean. Strategically, the Mediterranean
area is not a coherent system, its problems are not military in
nature, sub-regional diversities are great. But a common mentality
must spread, similar to that which is applicable to Europe.<BR>

<P>
The WEU &quot;Common concept 27&quot; states that &quot;the Mediterranean
basin is a high priority for European security ... (calling for)
guidelines for co-operation (and) permanent dialogue&quot;, recognising
that there is no direct military threat from the South. Barcelona
has indicated the same initial stepping-stones. Soft security
measures, dispelling misperceptions, could consist in exchanges
of information, an inventory of the commitments undertaken, a
comparison of experiences, a review of co-operative models (for
peacekeeping operations, crisis prevention, consultation, assistance
- in particular within OAU; for non-proliferation; for the containment
of new risks). <BR>

<P>
An evolutionary process is underway, rather than a state of affairs,
in each of our countries, in continental Europe as well as in
the Mediterranean. For mutual relations to develop, the rediscovery
of one's own and each others' identities is a prerequisite, that
must involve the participation of all of the strands of our civil
societies.<BR>

<P>
Even the military instrument is nowadays subjected to these multiple
factors, as it adapts to a new preventive role, under conditions
of greater transparency. Prevention is the overriding requirement,
involvement rather than containment the new imperative. Transparency
and exchange of views and experiences are the essential instruments.
Pluralism of contributions constitute at the same time the goal
and the prerequisite for further advances.<BR>

<P>
In the Mediterranean, the North-South relationship must expand,
but it presupposes a South-South two-way street. European states
individually and the Commission must evolve beyond their bilateral
relationships with North African states. The Fifteen cannot however
deal with the North Africans one by one, lest they be accused
of ganging up: Europe, as Kissinger used to remind Europeans,
needs to dial &quot;one telephone number&quot; to reach most usefully
its North African partners.<BR>

<P>
After the Ministerial Council of Petersberg in June 1992, the
Mediterranean Group of the WEU indicated seven principles that
should inspire the Euro-Mediterranean endeavour in the security
field. They are: dialogue, transparency, confidence, conflict
prevention, sufficiency, peaceful settlement of conflicts and
non-proliferation of armaments.<BR>

<P>
Now that a broader concept of security is being accepted also
in the Mediterranean, the opportunity exists of addressing the
relevant military concepts, starting with CSBMs. They should achieve
transparency (through communications, exchanges, common strategic
language), co-operation (in PKOs also within OAU, humanitarian/civil
protection, nonproliferation and the tackling of new risks), working
groups (for bilateral, trilateral co-operative purposes), and
multinational operational endeavours (such as manoeuvres and exercises).
<BR>
<BR>

<P>
With such CSCMs, collective security would develop, as a process,
incrementally, in the Mediterranean as usefully as in continental
Europe, in the context of the partnership established in Barcelona.
<BR>

<P>
Since Barcelona, WEU within EU and the Mediterranean have a clear
road ahead of them. Political will should combine the evolving
events to provide the energy for all parties concerned to proceed

<B>I. America Rediscovers the Mediterranean <BR>
</B>
<P>
Throughout the Cold War, and until very recently, the question
of U.S. interests in Southern Europe and the Maghreb would have
been considered eccentric. The American role in Europe was seen
almost exclusively in terms of involvement in the centre of the
continent. Similarly, the U.S. involvement in the Middle East
was focused to an overwhelming extent on the peace process on
Israelis borders, or stability in the Persian Gulf. Southern Europe
and the Maghreb -- indeed the Mediterranean itself -- figured
only peripherally in U.S. policy toward Europe and the Muslim
world. Unlike many Europeans, Americans have very little consciousness
of the Mediterranean as an area of geopolitical consequence. Washington
may have important stakes and active policies toward the Mediterranean
and its sub-regions, but these have rarely been described explicitly
in &quot;Mediterranean&quot; terms. <BR>

<P>
In the new international environment, however, practical American
interest in the Mediterranean is gathering pace very rapidly and
is giving rise to new perspectives and new policy concerns. Mediterranean
problems, broadly defined, now figure prominently in our diplomacy
in both European and Middle Eastern settings. Indeed, many of
the traditional distinctions between these regions are breaking
down in the face of new transnational challenges, and nowhere
is this new interdependence as pronounced as in southern Europe
and the Maghreb. As the following discussion suggests, these challenges
go beyond narrow security issues in which Washington has been
a long-standing actor. Migration, economic development, and the
implications of these issues for regional stability and prosperity
are at the heart of the emerging American debate about the Mediterranean.
<BR>

<P>
It has become fashionable on both sides of the Atlantic to speak
of Mediterranean problems and initiatives. From an American perspective
it is worth noting that this is less a discovery than a <I>rediscovery
</I>of a long-standing engagement. Few Europeans -- and even fewer
Americans -realise that the U.S. has been a power in the Western
Mediterranean for nearly two hundred years. Some of our oldest
diplomatic missions are in southern Europe and the Maghreb, and
our earliest experience with overseas military presence and &quot;power
projection&quot; was in the region. Our political, economic and
military presence is not simply a Cold War artefact, but rather
a product of our historical stake in developments on Europe's
southern periphery.<BR>

<P>
<B>II. Regional Interests<BR>
</B>
<P>
U.S. perspectives and interests in the Mediterranean can be viewed
in three ways: first, as an extension of the European environment
and transatlantic relations; second, as an aspect of policy toward
the Middle East (the Arab-Israeli peace process, regional stability
and relations with the Muslim world); and three, as a response
to crises and change in the region itself. Although traditional
security issues, including military risks, are clearly part of
the U.S. debate about the future of the region -- and the presence
of the Sixth Fleet reinforces this aspect of American concern
-- economic and social factors are increasingly central. In this
regard, one of the key characteristics of the western as opposed
to eastern basin of the Mediterranean is the predominance of political
and economic challenges over direct military risks. The European
Union, with its more extensive economic and social ties to the
Maghreb may be best placed to lead in Western policy toward the
&quot;south&quot;, but the U.S. will remain an important actor
with a stake in the success of Mediterranean dialogue and cooperation.
<BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>1. Europe Looks South<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
With the end of the Cold War confrontation in Europe, the focus
of transatlantic attention has shifted from the center of the
continent to the periphery, both east and south. In the east,
the U.S. has an overwhelming interest in the political and economic
development and reintegration of the former communist states.
At the same time, attention to developments in the south is essential
to the maintenance of a relevant U.S. role in European affairs.
As Southern Europe and Europe as a whole has become more concerned
with problems emanating from the Mediterranean, developments on
Europe's southern periphery have become more prominent in Washington's
approach to Europe. In short, U.S interests in the Mediterranean
are to a considerable extent derivative of Europe's own concerns
about the region.<BR>

<P>
U.S. perceptions of southern Europe itself have also evolved considerably
in recent years. Southern Europe's progressive entry into the
European mainstream in political, economic and social terms has
had a pronounced effect on the way Portugal, Spain, Italy and
Greece are seen in the eyes of American policy makers and observers.
High growth rates and marked increases in prosperity, despite
pockets of underdevelopment, have forced a reassessment of traditional
American images of southern Europe. In this context, Italy has
led the way, but the point applies in general terms to the entire
region.<BR>

<P>
Southern European countries have a long history as net exporters
of labour, and much of this economic migration has been across
the Atlantic. Today, migration to Mediterranean Europe from North
Africa, and the political consequences of this development, are
important new items on the transatlantic agenda. The Mediterranean
is among the world's most dramatic demographic, economic and cultural
fault lines. Taking a broad definition of the region, from Lisbon
to Athens, a rich North faces a poor and increasingly populous<B>
</B>South. The population around the southern and eastern shores
of the Mediterranean is growing at a rate of roughly three percent
annually. The North African population, excluding Egypt, is expected
to double by 2025, reaching roughly 140 million. If Egypt is taken
into account, the total will be in the range of 260 million. With
Turkey -- politically part of the rich West from Washington's
standpoint, but economically closer to the South -- the total
population of states around the poorer shores of the Mediterranean
will reach some 350 million not long after the end of the century.
By contrast, the total population of the current members of the
European Union will probably not exceed 300 million in the same
period. If these trends continue, the population of the southern
Mediterranean will be double that of the north by the middle of
the 21st century.<BR>

<P>
This demographic imbalance, coupled with perennial stagnation
in the southern Mediterranean economies (until recently, Turkey
was an exception, with the highest growth rates in the OECD) has
fuelled substantial migration to western Europe. Over half of
Europe's migrant labour force of seven million has arrived from
the Maghreb or Turkey. Germany alone is host to 1.5 million Turkish
&quot;guest workers,&quot; roughly a third of whom are ethnic
Kurds. In France, North Africans are the leading element in the
country's foreign population. Traditionally, economic migrants
from across the Mediterranean have gravitated toward the larger
industrial economies in western Europe. With increasing prosperity,
however, the countries of southern Europe have emerged as significant
destinations in themselves, as well as conduits for migration.
<BR>

<P>
The economic effects of migration from the south on employment
and prosperity in the north are the subject of considerable debate
on both sides of the Atlantic (and are addressed in detail elsewhere
in this study). With the rise of migration as a public policy
issue in the U.S., the European experience in this regard will
be of interest to American audiences. However, it is the internal
and external political consequences of migration across the Mediterranean
that occupy a central place in U.S. perceptions. migration to
Europe from the south has had a pronounced effect on debates about
national identity and national security, with potentially importantimplications
for U.S. policy. Anti-immigration measures have emerged as a leading
item on right-wing political agendas, especially in France, Italy
and Germany. Mainstream politicians, spurred on by the risk (and
reality) of violent spillover from instability in the Maghreb
and Turkey, have also taken up the anti-immigration cause. The
migration question has potentially enormous consequences for relations
between north and south as well as European security because it
is not simply about economics or the cost of subsidising stability
across the Mediterranean. Ultimately, the question is about culture
and a growing, if unfortunate, perception of a new cold war between
north and south, rich and poor, the West.and Islam. Washington
has a clear stake in avoiding the rise of a new ideological and
strategic divide along the lines of Samuel Huntington's controversial
notion of a &quot;clash of civilizations''. Such a clash would
severely complicate U.S. policy toward Europe and the Muslim world.
<BR>

<P>
Europe will likely seek to insulate itself from the risks associated
with migration, both real and imagined. The European right will
continue to worry about loss of national identity. Governments
will act to restrict migration (and to move cautiously on multilateral
arrangements with implications in this area, such as the Schengen
agreement) because it is politically popular to do so, and out
of fear that unrestricted migration from Europe's unstable southern
periphery will encourage social tensions and political violence
on European soil. Crackdowns on supporters of the PKK (Kurdish
Workers Party) and the Algerian Islamists attest to European concerns
on this score. The revolutions in Eastern Europe were accomplished
without battles on Western European territory. As the recent terrorist
incidents in France suggest, Europe, including southern Europe,
may not be able to insulate itself as effectively from the more
violent political transformations taking place across the Mediterranean.
<BR>

<P>
From a U.S. perspective, the perceived linkage between migration
and instability in the Maghreb has important transatlantic implications.
First, the migration issue has strengthened the position of right
wing and nationalist forces generally. This trend could ultimately
change the political landscape in Europe in ways that might well
affect transatlantic relations, including the renationalisation
of European foreign and security policies. Second, Europe's exposure
to the deepening crisis in Algeria could well lead to substantial
refugee flows or more dramatic violence against Western interests
and citizens. It is not inconceivable that the U.S. would be asked
to assist in the event of a mass evacuation or hostage crisis.
Under certain circumstances, the U.S. might wish to join with
the EU in facilitating a dialogue between the regime and its opposition
in Algiers. Moreover, and perhaps most significantly, after years
of discussions on new security arrangements in Europe focused
almost exclusively on policy toward central and eastern Europe
(and more reluctantly, the Balkans), policy makers in Lisbon,
Madrid, Paris and Rome are paying greater attention to a crisis
on their doorstep. For Washington, the price of French and southern
European cooperationin policy toward central and Eastern Europe
in the years ahead may well turn out to be more active cooperation
on problems across the Mediterranean.<BR>

<P>
U.S. policy will also have to take account of the growing role
of southern Europe in European initiatives aimed at development
and stability in the Mediterranean region. with a succession of
proposed or active initiatives, from the &quot;global&quot; concept
of a CSCM (Conference on Security and Cooperation in the Mediterranean)
to more limited exercises such as the &quot;Five plus Five&quot;
grouping in the Western Mediterranean and the Mediterranean Forum
reaching further east, southern Europe has found a new and far
more active diplomatic voice. France, as a Mediterranean power,
has also reinvigorated its southern engagement through these as
well as bilateral activities. Most recently, the EU is experiencing
three successive Mediterranean presidencies -- France, Spain and
Italy. The net result is a striking rise of activity in this sphere,
with the November 1995 Euro-Med conference shaping up as a landmark
event. The Barcelona meeting will address the political, economic
and cultural dimensions of Mediterranean dialogue, and will launch
the EU's five year program of nearly seven billion ECUs in aid
for southern and eastern Mediterranean partners.<BR>

<P>
The subject of U.S. and other extra-Mediterranean participation
at Barcelona has received considerable attention in Europe, and
various schemes for observer or guest status have been proposed.
Regardless of the outcome of the EU debate on this question --
and there is strong opposition to the idea of U.S. involvement
in France and elsewhere -Washington is likely to be supportive
of the event as well as the general aims of the EU-med dialogue.
Most of the traditional Cold War era skepticism about Mediterranean
initiatives has waned, and EU assistance across the Mediterranean
is broadly compatible with Washington's desire to strengthen the
economic and social dimensions of the Middle East peace process.
In the security realm, the fledgling NATO Mediterranean initiative,
opening Alliance dialogue with Mauritania, Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt
and Israel, is likely to take center stage. Over the longer term,
the proliferation of Mediterranean initiatives and the fact that
many of the most pressing &quot;Third Pillar&quot; issues on the
transatlantic agenda (e.g., international crime, migration and
refugees, terrorism, drug smuggling) have direct relevance to
the Mediterranean environment, argues for more serious and deliberate
consideration of U.S. and European roles in policy toward the
region.<BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>2. The Middle Eastern Dimension <BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
Traditionally, U.S. strategic thinking has accorded considerable
importance to the Mediterranean and its hinterlands as routes
for power projection in areas of key interest such as the Persian
Gulf. Indeed, in logistical terms, the Mediterranean, including
southern Europe and the Maghreb, may be described as the &quot;place
where the Persian Gulf begins.&quot; This reality was clearly
demonstrated during the last Gulf war, in which some 90 percent
of the troops, equipment and materiel sent to the region went
through or over the Mediterranean. Access to bases and the ability
to overfly national airspace in the western Mediterranean remains
essential to American freedom of action in the greater Middle
East and, again, the experience of the Gulf war points to the
role of southern European countries in this regard. Two factors
are likely to shape the character of this sort of security cooperation
in the future. First, the negative reaction of public opinion
in the Maghreb to Western intervention in the Middle East will
continue to cloud the prospects for cooperation with regimes in
the region. It will also complicate the calculus of southern European
allies in times of crisis. As the Gulf experience suggests, countries
such as Spain and Portugal will have to weigh carefully the costs
and benefits of cooperation in the face of strong public reaction
across the Mediterranean. Second, the prospect of the spread of
weapons of mass destruction and the means for their delivery at
longer ranges makes this an increasingly tangible, not just theoretical,
strategic problem. Ballistic missiles capable of reaching southern
European capitals from the southern and eastern shores of the
Mediterranean, in addition to the existing potential for terrorism,
suggest that the era of southern European &quot;sanctuarisation&quot;
is drawing to a close. Europe, especially southern Europe is increasingly
exposed to the retaliatory consequences of U.S. and Western actions
in the Middle East.<BR>

<P>
Beyond these overt security concerns, the Mediterranean is also
acquiring new importance in the context of U.S. economic and political
interests in the Middle East. Although the peace process is within
the Mediterranean space in the strict, geographic sense, American
policy makers tend not to see the activity in Mediterranean terms.
Indeed, until very recently, there has been considerable reluctance
to envision a more active European role in the process. But with
significant breakthroughs on the Palestinian and Jordanian tracks,
and the need to reinforce these agreements in economic terms,
the European role has become essential. Moreover, with the higher
profile of Morocco and Tunisia in the peace process, including
the multilateral track, the center of gravity in Arab-Israeli
relations has shifted to a measurable degree. In the multilateral
negotiations on Arms Control and regional Security (ACRS), for
example, the question of sub-regional (e.g., North African) concerns
and arrangements has become increasingly important over the course
of the talks. In fact, the security principles and confidence
building measures under discussion in ACRS closely parallel the
discussion of CSCE-type arrangements for the Mediterranean. In
short, as Europe and the Maghreb have become more actively involved
in Arab-Israeli questions, the peace process has acquired a more
significant Mediterranean dimension.<BR>

<P>
In functional terms, U.S. policy over the past few years has devoted
considerable attention to ways of broadening and deepening Middle
East peace. To date the achievements of the peace processes in
the region have been confined largely to the level of high politics,
with few tangible benefits for Middle Eastern societies. The Middle
East Economic Summit in Casablanca and its follow-on in Amman,
and the U.S. proposal for a Middle East/North Africa Development
Bank, reflect an interest in developing the economic dimension
of the process, with the aim of enlarging the constituency for
peace. The Maghreb is poised to play a central role in this context
as a result of its close economic relationship with the EU and
the &quot;moderating role&quot; of Morocco and Tunisia in Arab
affairs.<BR>

<P>
Although the U.S. is a secondary economic actor in the Maghreb,
the scope of American investment and financial ties to the region
is significant, especially in the energy sector. U.S. policy makers
and observers are aware of the pronounced southern European dependency
on natural gas supplies from North Africa, a dependency which
is set to increase with the construction of additional high capacity
pipelines in the central and western Mediterranean. The U.S. shares
a systemic, if indirect, interest in the economic and political
implications of new energy infrastructure in North Africa and
across the Mediterranean. Even in the face of continued instability
and perhaps radical change in Algeria, it is arguable that new
pipelines are likely to promote useful interdependence rather
than simply deepening vulnerabilities.<B><FONT SIZE=2>3. Arc of
Crisis or Arc of Change?<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
The area stretching from the Western Sahara to Turkey's Middle
Eastern borders is often described as an &quot;arc of crisis.&quot;
A cursory survey of contemporary crises and potential flash points
may support this description. Indeed, from the point of view of
American policy makers there can be little doubt that the Algerian
crisis (and Turkey's internal and external challenges, at the
other end of the Mediterranean) are driving perceptions about
the region, and much of the new interest in the Mediterranean
flows from its role as a center of tension and conflict. A more
meaningful analysis might look to the underlying forces of change,
both internal and external, across a region in the midst of substantial
and often violent change.<BR>

<P>
From the U.S. perspective the political challenge posed by Islamist
movements in Algeria and elsewhere in the Maghreb is not simply
regional but systemic. U.S. policy makers have devoted a good
deal of energy to the problem of policy toward political Islam.
Notwithstanding our experience in Iran, the preference of the
past few years has been for a more sophisticated approach which
distinguishes between the revival of Islam at the cultural and
religious level, the emergence of Islam as a political force,
and the existence of radical Islamic movements with strong anti-democratic
and anti-Western views. U.S. interests are in no sense threatened
by Islam as a religion, or even by Islam as a focus for political
opposition to regimes suffering from a lack of competence or legitimacy.
On the other hand, U.S. interests would be threatened by the advent
of regimes whose Islamist agenda leads them to violate international
norms in their internal and external behavior.
<P>
The rise of political Islam as the most potent expression of political
opposition around the southern and eastern shores of the Mediterranean,
combined with the mishandling of Islamist movements by existing
regimes, has resulted in growing insecurity and instability, with
no clear end in sight. The turmoil in Algeria, which has claimed
at least 40,000 victims, is the most dramatic case. Egypt faces
a similarly critical, if less overt Islamist challenge.The triumph
of political Islam in either country -- and some observers regard
this as a foregone conclusion in Algeria -- would send shock waves
throughout the Muslim world, including Muslim communities in Europe.
Under these circumstances, the stability of Morocco, Tunisia and
Libya could not be taken for granted. In the eastern Mediterranean,
remote from the Maghreb but prominent in the minds of American
observers, secular Turkey is under mounting pressure from Islamists
(and Turkish nationalists) within the political system. Many analysts
on both sides of the Atlantic believe that a m<I>aodus vivendi
</I>would be possible with new Islamic regimes, particularly those
that might come to power through non-violent means. Others would
prefer not to see this political experiment conducted on their
doorstep, not least because of the potentially serious implications
for refugee flows and regional security.<BR>

<P>
Algeria is the most dramatic example of the problems of legitimacy
and pervasive insecurity to be found to greater or lesser degree
in virtually all of the southern Mediterranean states. The demographic
pressures noted earlier in the context of migration have produced
a growing cohort of half-educated, unemployed young people with
few outlets for their economic, political and social aspirations.
The perceived gap between aspirations and reality in maghrebi
societies may well be heightened by proximity to Europe and the
availability of European television and other media.<BR>

<P>
Much of the current Western approach to the problems of these
societies assumes a close connection between economic development,
prosperity, and political stability. Over the long-term, this
is likely to be the case. In the near-term, the problem of conflicting
political and economic time-frames may be more acute. It is worth
noting here that among Maghrebi economies, Morocco has the worst
distribution of income, followed by Tunisia. By contrast, Algeria
has traditionally had the best distribution of income. Admittedly,
this comparison tells us very little. But it does suggest that
the linkage between economic circumstances and political stability
is more complex than is often assumed when aid and reform measures
are debated. The Algerian experience also suggests that in some
cases the crisis of political legitimacy and social dissatisfaction
may be beyond economic solutions. Algeria faces an immediate political
crisis that demands political rather than economic (or security)
remedies.<BR>

<P>
As policy makers in southern Europe and elsewhere in the EU shape
a more active policy toward the non-EU Mediterranean states they
are likely to confront more directly the relationship between
economic and political factors in promoting stability. Aid and
investment strategies are popular topics for discussion with Maghrebi
governments. Economic and (above all) political reform are far
more difficult subjects. Perhaps because of distance or less direct
exposure to events in the region, American observers have been
somewhat more inclined than their European counterparts to insist
on the need to address problems of political legitimacy and democratisation
as part of a strategy toward the &quot;south&quot;. More serious
thinking also needs to be done on both sides of the Atlantic,
as well as within the Maghreb itself, about the risks and stresses
associated with reform in the near-term, in the context of stability
as a longer-term objective. Southern European and Maghrebi interests
may well diverge if the objective is to promote growth, increase
employment, and reduce migration -- but with substantial risks
for regime stability in the near term as a result of the elimination
of subsidies, the closure of state enterprises, and a general
opening to Western societies. <BR>

<P>
An additional challenge for the EU is likely to flow from the
need to balance competing needs for assistance in the south and
the east, as well as between the Maghreb and southern Europe,
still a leading consumer of EU funds. The extent and character
of the EU's aid and investment in the Maghreb in the years ahead
may be strongly influenced by the evolution of European integration,
including the pace of enlargement to the east. What resources
will be available to promote development and stability in the
south? How might the entry of new members and freer movement of
labour within a reunited Europe influence the supply and demand
for labour in western Europe, and thus the incentives for economic
migration from across the Mediterranean? The pattern of American
aid and investment on Europe's southern and eastern periphery
may be acontributing factor in this equation, and argues for more
active transatlantic coordination.<BR>

<P>
<B>III. Overall observations and conclusions<BR>
</B>
<P>
The relationship between southern Europe and the Maghreb is at
the center of a number of key social, political, economic and
security issues affecting Europe and the Middle East. As this
brief discussion suggests, the U.S. has a strong stake in developments
on both sides of the Mediterranean, and will have a keen and continuing
interest in efforts to address transnational challenges in the
region. Overall, and from an American perspective, the geopolitical
setting for debate over specific policy questions, including migration,
economic growth and north-south dialogue, is likely to be shaped
by three trends.<BR>

<P>
First, the recent attention to Mediterranean security, broadly
defined, is likely to continue and perhaps intensify as events
in Algeria and elsewhere confirm the region's position as an arc
of crisis -- and more importantly -- an &quot;arc of change&quot;.
Fundamental questions of political legitimacy, economic potential
and international relations are being played out on Europe's southern
periphery. Outcomes across the Mediterranean will have significant
consequences for societies along the northern shore, not least
in the areas of migration, energy, and social cohesion. The Mediterranean,
in particular the western Mediterranean, exemplifies the post-Cold
War convergence between what had previously be seen as quite separate
European and Middle Eastern environments. <BR>

<P>
Second, southern European countries will continue to find Mediterranean
issues and initiatives a particularly attractive outlet for their
growing diplomatic activism within the EU and elsewhere. Moreover,
the existence of tangible problems in the south is also likely
to compel the attention of larger European powers, certainly France
and possibly Germany. This trend is increasingly compatible with
U.S. interests in Europe and the Middle East, and Washington can
be expected to support Mediterranean initiatives emanating from
the EU as well as NATO. With regard to southern Europe itself,
American policy has moved steadily towards treating southern Europe
in a less distinctive fashion, that is, as an increasingly active
part of the European mainstream. A succession of Mediterranean
EU presidencies has helped to advance this trend on a practical
level.<BR>

<P>
Finally, shared stakes in Mediterranean developments together
with shared (if not always equal or symmetrical) interests and
policy instruments suggest the need for more active transatlantic
cooperation on problems in the region. Europe may properly play
a leading role in policy toward the southern shores of the Mediterranean,
where political and economic problems predominate. But it would
be an error for the U.S, to be engaged actively only in the security
realm. There is a need for a more concerted approach across the
full range of issues facing the region, from Algeria and political
Islam, to development assistance and discussion of lessons to
be learned from relevant public policy problems elsewhere. There
is already a trend towards the appearance of Mediterranean issues,
as well as functional issues with special significance for the
region, on official and unofficial transatlantic agendas. It is
a trend worth encouraging.<BR>

<P>
Peace, stability, security and prosperity are the key words stressed
in the Declaration approved at the Euro-Mediterranean Conference
in Barcelona last November. This is understandable considering
that these four virtues are markedly scarce in the Mediterranean
region. There is no denying however that the four are intimately
connected so that it cannot be realistically assumed that one
of them could be secured and enjoyed in the longer-term without
the other three. Instability in the Mediterranean arises mainly
from the historical sub regional conflicts, from the attempt of
radical states to radicalise international relations in the region,
and from the internal instability of some states. A sense of insecurity
arises because of the national military buildups by some key actors,
unresolved conflicts, the historic experience of the use of force
to resolve issues, and, above all, the imbalance between strong
and populous states on the one hand and small, unarmed countries
on the other hand. Many countries sense their own &quot;vulnerability&quot;,
in the meaning employed by Buzan<FONT SIZE=1>,</FONT> who distinguished
between threats, sometimes very hard to perceive, and vulnerabilities,
which he claims &quot;are fairly concrete&quot;. In the case of
many Mediterranean states, this vulnerability arises from the
strategic positions they occupy: Turkey at the head of the Dardanelles,
Egypt on the Suez Canal, Morocco and Spain command the narrow
passage linking the Mediterranean with the Atlantic, the Straits
of Gibraltar, Malta the main seaways in the midst of the Mediterranean,
and Cyprus a geostrategic position close to Turkey and the Middle
East. Some of them possess important mineral resources such as
oil, gas or phosphates.<BR>

<P>
Some have a &quot;historical sense&quot; of vulnerability <I>vis
a vis</I> more powerful neighbours (Greece - Turkey, Cyprus -
Turkey ) The nation state is by historic time-scale a recent artifact.
Hence, the internal weakness of such states, their unstable institutions
and economic problems increase their vulnerability to external
meddling, strengthens their disposition to arms buildups to overcome
their perceived vulnerabilities and in turn present a security
dilemma to their neighbours. Most of the countries of the region
have only recently emerged from colonial rule. The growing strength
of political movements which challenge the internal 
<P>
status quo in some key countries is also viewed as a source of
both instability and insecurity. Terrorism appears to be endemic
to the region. Drug trafficking is a growing concern in tandem
with the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Falling
prosperity is evident on both the northern as well as southern
shores of the Mediterranean. In the south it is reflected in the
falling GNP per capita ratios, as economic growth continues to
be generally positive but inadequate to keep up with demographic
changes. On the northern shore countries it is epitomised by the
growing developmental gap between the southern and northern regions
of Europe. On both shores rising unemployment, an inadequate economic
infrastructure, social and health care problems bedevil governments.
In the southern shore states, a liberal democratic state structure
based on the full and adequate participation of the people, expectancy
of peaceful change in governance through fair elections, the rule
of law and respect for human rights are still far from becoming
the norm, making such states prone to change by violent means
and raising concern in Europe about their long-term stability.
<BR>

<P>
The European Union has long realised that instability in the Mediterranean
region can possibly have destabilising effects on Europe itself.
Lacking the institutions and the legal basis for joint political
action by the Member States in the fields of security and defence,
it acted as a civilian power in the region, employing economic
statecraft to achieve political aims. The first association agreements
signed with Greece and Turkey in the early sixties were particularly
aimed at strengthening the economic stability of these key NATO
countries in the era of the policy of containment. It used the
association agreement with Greece to show its disdain of the military
junta while the latter reigned in Athens, and finally it opened
its doors wide open to Greece, Spain and Portugal in order to
stabilise the democratisation and modernisation process following
the end of the dictatorships in the three countries. Similarly,
the European Union is employing like means in its efforts to stabilise
the situation in central and eastern Europe as well as the Mediterranean
region. In the past, it skilfully employed the Global Mediterranean
Policy (GMP) to bind all the countries of the region (except Libya
and Albania which refused a formal accord with the Community)
in a relationship to it, though this did not always turn out to
be a happy one, especially from the late seventies onwards when
the Community applied protectionist measures against the MNCs
on textile and clothing goods. The GMP has had a positive effect
in helping the MNCs maintain their traditionally important exports
to Metropolitan Europe, partially transforming the relationship
from one of dependence into interdependence, but in the seventies,
when Europe found itself in economic difficulties it quickly turned
protectionist so that this policy stance combined with supply-side
problems on the part of the MNCs quickly led to disgruntlement
with the GMP. Besides, the instruments of the GMP to tackle the
present problems which the EU faces in the Mediterranean region
are inadequate, both because these challenges demand twofold political
and economic initiatives, not merely economic statecraft, and
because in the post-Maastricht setting, when the EU is supposed
to be developing a Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) it
cannot limit itself to GMP methods, while the efficiency of its
policies has to be judged against the exploited and unexploited
potential of the Maastricht Treaty. In the past, the EC had tried
to remedy its obvious lack of a foreign policy by creating the
European Political Co-operation (EPC). However, an EC foreign
policy never came into being. Europe found itself divided on many
key issues, not least among these those related to the Mediterranean
region. The EC's response to the Middle East war of 1967 and then
to the first oil crisis in 1974 brought in to focus the divisions
among European states. Subsequently, hopelessly unable to give
substance to many of its policies, Europe limited itself to a
declarative foreign policy largely based on issuing statements,
many of which were exceptional in their content and foresight,
notwithstanding that at times they met with incredulous criticism
from the United States.<FONT SIZE=1> </FONT>During the cold war,
Europe played second fiddle to the superpowers in the maintenance
of the military balance of power in the region and was virtually
absent in the most important of the Mediterranean crises, notably
the Middle East problem. Lastly, in the absence of a European
foreign policy, the member states of the EC were left free to
conduct their own foreign policies as dictated by their respective
national interests, with some feeble attempts to co-ordinate them,
lest they face the graver accusation that they were sidetracking
the more profound aim of developing EPC. The weakness of EPC was
not only exploited but used as an excuse for individual forays.
This resulted in a number of premature initiatives in the region,
all cursed with the seeds of failure from their beginnings. Reference
to these initiatives will be made further down. <BR>

<P>
The new phase in the EU's relations with the Mediterranean countries,
launched with the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership started in Barcelona
will perhaps put an end to unco-ordinated national initiatives
and weld the economic and political aspects of Europe's policy
in the region more tightly. It has the advantage of making the
Union's Mediterranean policy a policy for the whole of the Union
rather than one limited to the Mediterranean member states. However,
it is rather still early to start celebrating the success of this
policy.<BR>

<P>
For a start, history testifies to the fact that the attention
which the EU has given to the Mediterranean region in the past
has been dyslexic, even in times when the Mediterranean region
was the only one where the Community could play a role in the
external arena. The pattern of the EC's policies towards the region
has been historically marked by flurries of intense activity followed
by long pauses of inertia as the Community busied itself with
internal matters. A period of inertia followed the signing of
the first Association agreements with two Mediterranean countries
at the start of the sixties and in fact, throughout the eighties
to the beginning of the nineties, the EC neglected the Mediterranean
region as it busied itself with a number of internal and external
problems: internally the completion of the internal market, the
Single European Act, the intergovernmental conference which led
to the signing of the Maastricht Treaty, the difficult ratification
process; externally - the completion of the negotiations leading
to the second enlargement (Spain and Portugal, 1985), negotiations
with the EFTA group for the creation of the European Economic
Area (EEA), enlargement negotiations with the EFTA group, the
Uruguay Round of negotiations, and finally after 1989 the situation
in Central and Eastern Europe. It was in response to growing criticism
that the EU was neglecting the Mediterranean region and the need
to reintroduce some balance in its external relations that, in
June 1990, proposals were put forward by the Commission for redirecting
the EU's Mediterranean policy. From there onwards it took another
five years for the proposal to be developed into the idea of the
Euro-Mediterranean Partnership launched last November.<BR>

<P>
This ambivalence may be explained by the fact that with only five
Mediterranean member states (if Portugal is considered as such)
the European Union is essentially a northern-central European
entity. Of the five Mediterranean states, Spain and Portugal have
only recently joined the Community and have been practically engrossed
with adjusting to their new situation. France, described by Braudel<FONT SIZE=1>
</FONT>as having throughout its history mostly identified with
central Europe, remains true to form in the contemporary age.
Italy, always beset by domestic political problems, generally
shuns external action. This has been more pronounced since the
&quot;end of the first Republic&quot;. Greece is interested only
in the Aegean and Turkey as we have been shown time and again,
and has used its EC membership to condition Turkey and more recently
to undermine Macedonia, with little time to spare for more comprehensive
ideas on the Mediterranean region as a whole. The enlargement
of the EU to include Malta and Cyprus will provide the Union with
mixed blessings: Cyprus will reinforce Greece's policy - thus
giving a negative contribution to the development of the CFSP;
Malta will presumably follow a policy more consistent with the
overall interests of the EU in the Mediterranean - thus giving
a positive contribution to the development of the Mediterranean
policy.<BR>

<P>
The Mediterranean member states of the EU now have the opportunity
to change old habits. Euro-Mediterranean leaders meeting in Barcelona
agreed to establish a comprehensive partnership among all the
states of the littoral, based on an ongoing dialogue. Three main
pillars were singled out for the realisation of these plans: the
establishment of a common area of peace and security; creating
an area of shared prosperity; and developing human resources,
promoting understanding between cultures and exchanges between
civil societies. The Barcelona Declaration is thus a manifesto
of good intentions for the Mediterranean region. The frequent
use of the word 'dialogue' elicits sentiments of <I>deja vu</I>
and reminds one that this is after all a continuation of the Euro-Arab
Dialogue began with much fanfare in 1975 over the heads of the
Americans worried that it would inject too much noise into Kissinger's
Middle East diplomacy model, or that it would decouple Europe
from the United states and split the Western camp. That 'dialogue'
of the deaf, as it turned out, led to few tangible results as
the Europeans struggled to secure guarantees of uninterrupted
oil supplies at reasonable prices while the Arab side tried in
vain to promote the Palestinian question. When world markets pushed
oil prices down, the 'dialogue' lost much of its luster for the
European side, while the divisions in the Arab world following
the Camp David accords weakened the interest of the other counterpart
as well. The process became another sad chapter in the history
of Euro-Mediterranean relations. It underlined the fact that the
two sides had ignored real designs and had opted instead for vague
idealistic ones. Had they adhered to the Cairo Joint Memorandum
both sides would have achieved more lasting results.<BR>

<P>
Before Barcelona, when it had already finalised its not so &quot;grand
design&quot; for the Mediterranean region, the European Union
decided to underwrite the effort with a not very generous, but
certainly not negligible sum of ECU 4.7 billion to be disbursed
over a period of five years (1995-99) in aid to the Non-Member
Mediterranean countries (MNCs).<FONT SIZE=1> </FONT>Originally
the Commission had proposed a total aid programme of ECUs 5.5.
billion in addition to European Investment Bank (EIB) resources.
This financial aid package is simply a continuation of the tradition
of financial aid started with the beginning of the so called 'Global
Mediterranean Policy' (GMP) in the mid-seventies. It is true that
the EU has a right to a &quot;Community Preference&quot; in favour
of its own backward regions in disbursing development aid. However,
the differences in the rate of such aid are staggering (for example,
aid to the MNCs is lower on a per capita basis than that given
to Central and Eastern Europe, while when compared with that given
to Ireland, Portugal and Greece under the structural funds, such
aid to the MNCs compared on a per capita basis is 57 times lower).
When consideration is taken of the fact that the EU's own backward
regions are by comparison more developed than the MNCs the inadequacy
of financial aid to the Mediterranean countries becomes even more
staggering. Not oblivious to the accusations that this sum was
inadequate and that it did not add to as much as the EU was spending
on central and eastern Europe, and noting that Europe's declared
aim to maintain a balance in its relations with all its neighbours,
the EU finally threw in the sop that this fund will be augmented
by unspecified financial assistance from the European Investment
Bank (EIB) and from bilateral aid agreements.
<P>
The question of financial aid to the MNCs is linked to the issue
of whether a sound case for it can be put forward. The matter
is somewhat complex. During the decade from the mid-seventies
to the mid-eighties, while increased wealth flowed to the oil
producers and non-oil countries benefited from increased trade
in goods and services (e.g earnings from workers' remittances)
with them or loans on very favourable terms, the negative effects
of bad economic policies of extensive state intervention, subsidies,
import substitution policies, capital controls, extensive bureaucracy
etc could be hidden under the flow of petrodollars. Significantly
among the MNCs five countries, all with a negligible or no dependence
on the oil economy and which followed an open economic policy
or launched one during the period, at present have some of the
more resilient economies in the region. Soon after the world price
of oil started declining and revenues dried up significantly,
the fissures began to appear and many MNCs were left perched on
a high foreign debt mountain. In the midst of this crisis the
MNCs, prodded by the IMF and World Bank, were converted to the
virtues of economic reform. Did they in fact have a choice? The
restructuring thus started under significantly adverse economic
conditions, compounded in some instances by a severe debt problem
and rapid population growth.<BR>

<P>
It is within this context that the poor financial package offered
by the EU should be discussed. One thing is certain, namely that
the Union cannot take on the challenges of transformation occurring
in central and eastern Europe and the Mediterranean simultaneously
without overhauling its finances and without ditching the wasteful
Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). The relevant question is whether
Europe should increase its aid package to a region (the Mediterranean)
which had enjoyed a decade of surplus wealth but was unable to
transform it into more lasting economic development. The answer
seems to be linked to the fact that the contextual frameworks
are different. The former situation, when the MNCs failed to take
advantage of the wind which blew in their sails was a missed opportunity.
The present situation is however one in which the MNCs are reforming
their economies and significant financial flows to such economies
in transition could help them overcome the unpopular adjustment
costs and enhance their internal social and political stability.
Previously, enough petrodollars existed in the region to help
MNC governments maintain stability. Now they can no longer do
so and uncontrolled instability can slip over into the Community
itself. The EC is not oblivious to the need of supporting reform.
In the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership Agreements initialled between
the EC and Tunisia, Morocco and Israel<FONT SIZE=1> </FONT>the
priorities established for financial aid are to help the MNCs
cope with reforms. The main questions remain whether the aid is
sufficient and whether enough attention has been given to the
time factor and cultural constraints. There is always a time lag
between the proposed economic restructuring and the benefits that
accrue from such initiatives. The second (i.e cultural constraints)
is related to the fact that it may be axiomatically difficult
to transfer the values of liberalisation, essentially of advanced
societies, to countries which culturally may still be unprepared
for modernisation at such speed. Clearly the economic decision-making
cannot be divorced from the political. <BR>

<P>
While falling short of fully underwriting the reforms in the Mediterranean
non-member countries with more generous financial aid, Europe
has not shown itself sympathetic to the political leeway which
the MNCs should be allowed to manage change either. Europe insisted
that as part of the Euro-Med Partnership, the MNCs must gradually
develop democracy and respect for human rights. Insistence on
these Western values is positive, but not unproblematic. Europe
must stand up for the respect of human rights. However, transformation
of the present regimes into democratic ones may, if it is allowed
to happen before the economic reforms have been given the chance
to bear their fruits, lead to the transfer of power from governments
which are not democratic (according to Western yardsticks) to
governments which actually do not believe in the Western notion
of democracy (the case of Algeria is instructive). The adverse
implications for Europe of such a development need not be spelled
out. Perhaps the aberration in this case is the non-truth that
the development of market economies and democratic principles
need move hand in hand. On the other hand the maintenance of authoritarian
rule in some MNCs may be needed to see the reforms through, once
other means such as increased financial aid are unavailable to
underwrite the process. Once market economies have bloomed, democracy
may come charging in its trail. Is this not the path which some
newly industrialising countries in Asia have followed ? Is this
not the trend that may, in the opinion of some crystal ball gazers,
see the last of the communists in China eventually swept away
? Democracy may not be a feasible project in all countries in
the Mediterranean in the medium term. Respect for human rights
short of full democratic rights may be a more workable solution.
<P>
Turning once more to the economic impact of the Free Trade Area,
so far reference has been made to the long-term benefits and short-run
costs. It is worth outlining what these costs and benefits are.
Some restructuring has already occurred in the MNCs to varying
degrees. The liberalisation process, which will be accelerated
by the free trade area should lead to the reallocation of economic
resources and help the MNCs shift these towards those economic
activities in which they have a comparative advantage. Much will
depend in this case on how fast this reallocation will take place.
The greater openness of the economy will encourage more competition
and cut down excessive monopolistic profits. It will increase
efficiency (more mergers and shutdowns of inefficient firms) but
unemployment will increase. 
<P>
Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) may be stimulated. But political
instability, and bureaucratic bottlenecks might bring around a
lower level of FDI than expected. Openness may also lead to disinvestment
in the sense of firms presently situated in the MNCs relocating
to Europe, once they will still be free to export to the MNCs.
The latter phenomenon may not be so large as to cause worries,
but watch out for perceptions on political stability in the MNCs.
<BR>

<P>
Lastly it is worth noting that many MNCs have already achieved
the most they could have achieved given their present economies
in their exports to the EC, and the new Euro-Mediterranean Partnership
agreements do not offer substantial improvements in this regard.
On the other hand, the EU stands to gain more from trade liberalisation
both in the short-run as well as in the long-run. <BR>

<P>
Many MNCs are already shifting their tax system from reliance
on import tariffs to consumption taxes (such as the introduction
of VAT) . An overhaul of the fiscal system is required in the
MNCs to set up a new fiscal balance between revenue and expenditure.
Liberalisation may also cause persistent balance of payments difficulties
as people spend more on consumption. In case of acute balance
of payments difficulties the EU has promised that it will help
the MNCs to overcome such difficulties in consultation with the
International Monetary Fund (IMF). All in all, the MNCs will have
to take a gradualist approach to liberalisation while at the same
time accelerating measures to improve their economic infrastructure,
develop human resources and industrial restructuring.
<P>
The state of economic health of the Mediterranean countries is
such that caution must be advised in approaching reforms. Consider
that according to World Bank's classification, in 1994-95, Jordan,
Morocco and Syria were designated as severely indebted countries,
while Albania, Egypt, Algeria, Greece, Tunisia, Turkey and the
ex-Yugoslav republics were moderately indebted countries.<FONT SIZE=1>
</FONT>Unemployment is another concern, reflecting the fact that
economic expansion has been unable to keep up with the expansion
in the labour force caused by demographic changes<FONT SIZE=1>.</FONT>
Rates of economic growth have to be increased massively if these
countries are to provide enough job opportunities to keep up with
demographic changes. During periods of economic restructuring,
economies might do exactly the opposite of what is needed of them,
and shed jobs rather then create new ones.<BR>

<P>
In the abstract, the creation of a Euro-Mediterranean Free Trade
Area (FTA) will in the longer-run reap benefits for all the people
in the region thus helping to strengthen economic development,
social cohesion and internal stability in most countries. It will
also reap benefits for the EU which itself will be able to increase
its exports to the region. However, the limited content which
the Euro-Mediterranean free trade area has been given may yet
rob it of its major economic impact. For instance, it is detrimental
that agricultural trade has been left out and the free movement
of labour, at least after a transitional phase, is similarly excluded.
In the past, as transpired during the setting up of the Global
Mediterranean Policy and during the negotiations with the MNCs
preceding the second enlargement, further concessions to the MNCs
on agricultural exports were welcomed by northern EU member states
and resisted primarily by the EU Mediterranean member states.
The evidence is clear that although some concessions on agricultural
trade were made by the Community, as is amply shown in the first
three Euro-Mediterranean Partnership agreements concluded so far,
the issue of further trade liberalisation in this sector was postponed
until after the year 2000. For the MNCs, the weaker side in the
bargaining which has taken place, half a loaf may be better than
no bread at all. However, objectively considered, the EC has again
shown its meanness in a sector where it could greatly help the
MNCs without having to dip deeper in its coffers, something which
it (the EC) is extremely reluctant to do. By its actions the EC
is further retarding economic progress in the MNCs. <BR>

<P>
One more important query that needs be answered concerns the seriousness
with which the EU is pursuing the Euro-Mediterranean free trade
area. How much hope should we allow to glow in our hearts that
the EU is keen on realising the Euro-Mediterranean free trade
area ? This time the Community appears dead serious. Historically,
the creation of a free trade area was the aim of the Global Mediterranean
Policy, but alas three full decades into that policy it has never
come to pass, of course through no fault of the Community. The
main difficulty, though even in this case it is not completely
unproblematic, is not the liberalisation of north-south trade,
but the liberalisation of south-south trade and the free movement
of factors. Not even the concession of cumulative rules of origin
granted to the Maghreb countries in the bilateral trading agreements
signed with the EC since 1978 was enough to make these states
forge closer economic links between them. The Arab Maghreb Union,
which blows hot or cold depending on the situation in the region,
has fallen short of expectations, despite its rational underpinnings.
In the absence of resolve among the MNCs or of the conditions
which will lead to the realisation of the free trade on a south-south
basis, the European Union could possibly fill the gap by maintaining
a leadership role and ensuring the continuation of the momentum.
Yet on past experience, the EU is prone to retreat from Mediterranean
initiatives into long periods of neglect when it busies itself
with internal affairs. For the future, the EU's &quot;internal&quot;
agenda (the IGC, EMU etc) appears full. Externally its priority
is enlargement to include the countries of central and eastern
Europe, and not its relations with the Mediterranean countries.
<P>
One important consideration is that although, apart from what
has already been discussed so far, none of the EU world trading
rivals are prepared to mount the kind of policy for the Mediterranean
region which the EC has set up, the region is not impervious to
non-EU challenges such as those coming from lower cost producers
in Asia. The EU has every interest to consolidate its position
in the Mediterranean region. Then the EU's motivations for the
creation of the Euro-Mediterranean Free Trade area are not simply
altruistic. The FTA was not sought after by the MNCs which were
happy with unilateral concessions and would have preferred to
widen their benefits while carrying on with economic restructuring
and gradual trade liberalisation. World Trade Organisation (WTO)
rules established by the Uruguay Round entail that preferential
trading arrangements (PTAs) which the EU has with the MNCs are
legal only if they are eventually transformed into a free trade
area within a reasonable time of around a decade, though this
is not specified. PTAs have always militated against GATT's corner
stone, the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) clause, but were tolerated
on the grounds that the asymmetry which they introduced between
trading partners, whereby the developed countries granted preferences
to developing countries without requiring them to match these
concessions by equal and reverse preferences, favoured the developing
countries. Yesterday's dogma is today's untruth and there are
abundant economic arguments to show that this should no longer
be blindly accepted. Following the Uruguay Round, interim agreements
leading to the formation of a free trade area or a customs union
are no longer free from a time constraint, and they have now to
be achieved over an agreed time frame accepted by the WTO<FONT SIZE=1>.</FONT>
Hence the urgency of the EU to establish a time frame of 12 years
to achieve its free trade area agreements with the MNCs. <BR>

<P>
When due consideration is given to the WTO pressures and the fact
that the EC for its own interests is intent on achieving the free
trade area, it will appear that significant progress will be made
on north-south trade liberalisation, while south-south liberalisation
(which may be of greater economic importance to the MNCs) may
take much longer. In sum, the difficulties in concluding the FTA
are many: primarily there are three time factor problems, ie the
length of time it is going to take to negotiate the myriad accords
to establish the free trade area, the constraint that the EC-MNC
FTA will have to be established over a period of twelve years,
and last but not least that this twelve year period, which may
be short for the purposes of economic transformation with palatable
side-effects, may be too long for the political changes in the
region. They might turn in such a way as to eventually overturn
the whole process. Ironically, the longer the time frame, the
bigger the danger that the process will stall due to a worsening
of the political situation in the region. <BR>

<P>
There are however other difficulties: tariff dismantling and the
three freedoms<FONT SIZE=1> </FONT>will not bring about the FTA
unless trans-Mediterranean communications and transport networks
are also established. The Barcelona Declaration makes ample reference
to this. Achieving the networks will require a sustained investment
effort. A large amount of learning how to conduct south-south
trade is required, for the dominant trend is still the one established
during the colonial era on a north-south axis. This will require
a substantial amount of transfer of know-how from Europe to the
south. <BR>

<P>
In practical terms the eventual achievement of the Euro-Mediterranean
free trade area will depend in the first instance on the successful
upgrading of the EU's present trading agreements with the MNCs,
a process which has already started. Cyprus and Turkey have a
customs union in place and in any case Cyprus and Malta will join
the Union in about two years. New FTA agreements have been initialled
with Tunisia, Israel and Morocco, while negotiations carry on
with the rest. With regard to trade liberalisation and the four
freedoms, as far as a south-south basis is concerned, what may
be easier is a round of multilateral trade negotiations between
all the states of the region very much on traditional GATT pattern
(or the EU-EFTA negotiations for the EEA) with a priviously agreed
time-frame for the conclusion of the agreement, and which will
set out a working plan for the next twelve years .<BR>

<P>
Turning to the political aspect of the Euro-Mediterranean relationship,
the first priority for Europe is to resolve clearly in its mind
the tension between democracy and economic progress, both of which
have been singled out as contributing to security and stability
in the region. The argument is that the successful launching of
the FTA is essential for increasing the momentum of economic growth
in the region and for achieving greater prosperity. Prosperity
lessens social tensions and provides the conditions for internal
stability, and in turn makes possible the full democratisation
of societies. Democratisation of states lessens the chances of
war or external conflict, though it does not remove the threat
completely. It must not be assumed that fully fledged democracies
do not go to war<FONT SIZE=1> </FONT>or that the present conflict
situations in the Mediterranean are all the result of the absence
of democracy. Such mental leaps can lead to catastrophic policies.
An analogous leap is to say that the end of superpower confrontation
in the Mediterranean region has produced the conditions for ending
the conflicts. Indeed, the end of the cold war may have had beneficial
effects on the Middle East but may for example have removed one
of the strongest restraining influences on such historical rivals
as Greece and Turkey. The fall of communism may have deprived
the radical states in the region of the moral and material support
of the USSR, but new challenges have arisen from international
terrorism, supported very often from a number of far-flung countries
outside the region. The dissolution of the Soviet Union, may have
facilitated the proliferation of weapons, know-how and material
for the construction of weapons of mass destruction. Indeed, there
is no end of history in sight in the Mediterranean region.<BR>

<P>
Resort to collective security arrangements are a tempting proposition
but inherently flawed. Equally dangerous may be European institutional
prototypes grafted onto the region such as the proposed Conference
on Security and Co-operation in the Mediterranean (CSCM), the
Mediterranean Forum or the Council of the Mediterranean which
create opportunities for parliamentarians but are so broadly aimed
that they lose momentum. To borrow Bismarck's dictum from a completely
different historical context, &quot;the great questions of the
day will not be decided by speeches and the resolutions of majorities&quot;
but by actions which are more lasting. The institutions mentioned
above may become useful only when the urgent problems of economic
reform have been solved and democratic government has become the
norm. Unluckily for us, such institutions in the present conjecture
may be instrumental in creating a fictitious sense of security,
falling short of providing real security, and prolonging or stopping
the search for a real cure. 
<P>
What may be a more workable solution will be one in which Europe
will work actively with the main countries of the region in terms
of territorial size, population and military strength, in respect
of two or three of the most threatening issues in the region such
as international terrorism, proliferation of the weapons of mass
destruction and disarmament. The aim would be that lasting, verifiable
and enforceable agreements are achieved. Once a critical mass
is thus achieved in the region, other areas could then be tackled.
<BR>

<B>Conclusion<BR>
</B>
<P>
The problems of the Mediterranean region are many but not incurable.
This paper has concentrated on the main difficulties in achieving
the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership as I see them. The Partnership
will succeed if the variables discussed in this paper, or the
majority of them, are constantly kept in the forefront. One thing
is certain, there is a role for every country in the region to
play. The EU, as the richest and most powerful entity in the region,
must keep the momentum going constantly. The Barcelona Conference
does not make the Euro-Med Partnership. The EU must take the lead
in this, as it must assume the responsibility of giving the MNCs
more market access, especially by opening its markets more to
Mediterranean agricultural products. Economic reform in the MNCs
must take priority but this will be successful only if it moves
forward with a velocity which would allow the national authorities
to deal adequately with its negative side effects. The liberal
notion that the market will deal with all problems is flawed and
can produce disasters whereby unpopular economic changes give
rise to alternative totalitarianism in the MNCs. The EU can do
a lot to help this process forward primarily by reforming its
own financial resources with a view to providing more finance
to underwrite the reform processes. The time factor is enigmatic:
the longer the problems are left untackled, the worse they grow.
Too fast a reforming move forward may create negative repercussions
which may arrest the process. The more time passes, the greater
the possibility that the political setting will become hostile
to further reforms before the project has been successfully concluded.
Political and economic questions are deeply intertwined and the
EU cannot hope to execute its role satisfactorily by limiting
itself to the traditional tools of the GMP, namely economic statecraft,
or to those of EPC, namely a declarative foreign policy. The principal
role of the MNCs will consist in maintaining the reforms at home,
opening up with vigour to south-south economic integration, and
moving their societies further along the path of democracy and
human rights without endangering the whole process. Lastly, the
Euro-Mediterranean Partnership cannot be considered as a costless
project. In the short run, the MNCs must bear the burdens of transformation
while the EU must bear the costs of financing it. The EU is meanwhile
negotiating Euro-Partnership agreements with the MNCs. It has
concluded one such agreement with Tunisia and one with Morocco.

<P>
It is busily concluding one with Egypt and has upgraded its agreement
with Israel. All of these bear the stamp of the unequalness of
the two negotiating sides. The superior economic power of the
Union brought to bear against the singular weakness of the individual
MNCs could not have produced a more balanced outcome. Here lies
Europe's main weakness: it proclaims a Euro-Mediterranean Partnership
but at the same time it has not only taken the lead, (as it is
expected to do) to set the ball rolling, but is imposing its strength,
thus denuding the partnership concept of its proper meaning. Europe
understands, perhaps as no other power, that the economic weaknesses
of the MNCs and their divisiveness, (they all want to negotiate
singularly in a vain attempt to maximise their unilateral national
advantage) makes them &quot;deal takers&quot; and certainly not
&quot;deal makers&quot;. <BR>

<P>
Lastly, it is important for Europe to depart from the neo-liberal
notion of excessive reliance on market forces to put everything
right that is wrong. It will not work. Perhaps when considering
liberal philosophies, the answer to today's dilemmas may lie more
in the ideas of its founding fathers of the past two centuries
then in its modern exponents. Certainly this is not a call to
a post-modernist assessment but having opened this Pandora's Box,
it is not my intention to try to close it here.

<B>THE FOLLOW-UP OF THE SECURITY ASPECTS OF THE BARCELONA DECLARATION
WITH REGARD TO OTHER INITIATIVES IN THE AREA<BR>

Multilateral Department, Directorate-General for Political Affairs,
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Italy</FONT>
<HR>

<P>
The recent changes in the international scene, among which the
disappearance of the east-west confrontation and the progress
achieved by the Middle-Eastern peace process, have contributed
to reduce the dramatic impact of events in the region, favouring
the proliferation of co-operation initiatives, unthinkable in
the past, between the main political actors.<BR>

<P>
On the other hand, we have witnessed a series of destabilising
phenomena, giving a new dimension to security in the area, thus
justifying the action of the main international organisations,
which have each developed a Mediterranean volet. The main result
on the operational level has been the increasing recourse to multilateral
instruments as means of solving the problems of the area, including
those concerning the Middle-Eastern peace process.<BR>

<P>
The new multilateralism, after the freezing of previous experiences,
among which we can mention the CSCM Project and the 5+5 dialogue,
limited however to the western part of the basin, has been heralded
by an initiative aimed at contributing only indirectly to the
peace and stability in the area, that is the Mediterranean Forum
agreed in Alexandria in July 1994, to which Malta joined as eleventh
member a few months later. While not having achieved specific
results so far in the security field, this informal gathering
deserves nevertheless an autonomous profile as the only instance
so far existing between riparians. Other fora, such as NATO, WEU,
and OSCE (only to mention the main ones), have set up forms of
dialogue with Mediterranean partners of the southern rim, focusing
on security and military matters. In some cases the exchange of
information is pursued only on the political level, as in NATO,
in others it is institutionalised, with the participation of experts.
While aiming at defining possible common perceptions on the challenges
to stability and security in the area, the practice has shown
a different approach to security problems between the Maghreb
countries on one side, who tend to underline the economical and
social aspects (as well as terrorism, drug trafficking and pollution)
and Egypt on the other, which seems more inclined to consider
the military ones, even suggesting forms of consultation and co-operation
in this specific field. In this context interest has been shown,
for example for the activities of the new EUROFOR and EUROMARFOR
units and their operational tasks. Italy has suggested early warning
and common training of personnel involved in peace operations
as possible areas of interest in WEU. Out of the area humanitarian
and peace-keeping tasks of the Petersberg type have also been
also suggested in the new framework while the active participation
of Egyptian, Moroccan and Jordanian contingents in ex-Yugoslavia
has created a new climate in the NATO dialogue with these countries.
<BR>

<P>
A new element has been introduced in both organisations, with
the participation of Israel, whose specific perceptions contribute
to a trilateral polarisation of discussions. In this framework
the multilateralisation of meetings, to include at the same time
two or more dialogue partners has been envisaged, for example
in WEU, though this is still considered premature. An interesting
alternative has been suggested by the WEU Institute of Security
Studies, with collective briefings on some issues prior to meetings
to be held as before with each of the Mediterranean dialogue partners.
<P>
The approach favoured by Italy in these forms of dialogue, which
call indeed for a rationalisation through liaison groups in order
to avoid duplication, is flexibility as far as contents are concerned,
in order to include all issues of common interest, or regarding
the sphere of participants, with the possibility for new Mediterranean
partners to join (Algeria for example is not part of the NATO
dialogue). At the same time we stress the evolutionary nature
of the exercise, especially in the case of NATO, allowing for
a further step towards a more comprehensive dialogue.<BR>

<P>
In this context I wish to recall the idea expressed by the Italian
Minister of Defence Corcione in Williamsburg, suggesting the model
of partnership for peace - politically but not legally binding
- for some Mediterranean countries. An important aspect to consider
is the transatlantic dimension of a similar initiative, specially
considering new trends, promoted specially by France, towards
European caucus within the Alliance. On the other hand the picture
needs to be adjusted according to developments concerning the
nature and evolution of the organic link between NATO and WEU,
to be further clarified by the next Intergovernmental Conference
opening in Turin at the end of this month.<BR>

<P>
While a Mediterranean dimension has existed in CSCE since its
foundation, the dialogue with non-participant Mediterranean countries
(the name has been recently changed into Mediterranean partners)
has been further articulated, on the initiative of Italy, during
the Budapest Summit. On that occasion special priority was given
to security matters, by using some elements of the by then OSCE
model also for the Mediterranean considered as a whole. <BR>

<P>
Apart from recent changes, like holding a ministerial level conference
twice yearly and the creation of a contact group in Vienna, an
interesting Seminar on confidence and security building measures
was held last year in Cairo. Among its results the idea of a common
research center on Mediterranean agreed by Israel and Egypt. According
to new trends the relevant security matters are being increasingly
dealt with by OSCE instances competent for the Mediterranean in
all their aspects, including the socio-economic (migrations, etc.)
and, as proposed by Russia, on issues like terrorism, where the
competence of the organisation is questionable according to some
member states.<BR>

<P>
For a comprehensive picture of the main initiatives, may I recall
the work of the second interparliamentary Conference on security
and co-operation in the Mediterranean held in Valletta at the
end of last year, where the idea of creating an Association of
Mediterranean states, on the model of the Council of Europe, was
presented, requesting the Conference of Barcelona to support it,
as was reflected in the final declaration. In the same context
we may mention the project of a global initiative, including security,
presented on behalf of King Hassan of Morocco at the 1993 CSCE
ministerial Conference in Rome. The recognition by the European
Council in Essen of the strategic importance of security in the
Mediterranean, as a matter of concern for Europe and the world,
has led to the development of the call expressed in Corfu for
a global response, taking into account the composite nature of
the phenomenon. Besides the risks of arms proliferation, still
present in the region, the concept of an indivisible security
refers also to political, economical, social and cultural aspects,
such as terrorism, organised crime, drug trafficking and illegal
immigration.<BR>

<P>
While previous fora adopted either a political or a security approach
in tackling the problem of destabilising factors in the region,
the Euro-Mediterranean initiative approved in Barcelona is supposed
to act for the first time through a combination of both, according
to a model to be defined as political security, reflected in the
title of the first volet of the final declaration. The security
aspects of Barcelona, which appear quite modest as they concern
only a few paragraphs of the Declaration, have to be considered
in this light, bearing in mind the innovative character of this
volet in respect to the others.
<P>
In an effort to go further than the models of the past, the process
initiated envisages a shared and common strategy with third Mediterranean
countries already linked by economical bilateral agreements with
the European Union, to be realised on the basis of the unanimous
consensus expressed in Barcelona on some thorny issues concerning
the Middle-Eastern peace process. In this respect while the initiative
was deliberately presented as a separate exercise (differently
from the initiatives of Casablanca and Amman), the participation
in Barcelona for the first time at the same table of some of the
main actors of the peace process can be considered indeed as one
of the main achievements of the Conference.<BR>

<P>
Focusing on the main aspects of the package, we have first a series
of general principles concerning internal and external rules,
in relation to which appropriate action is expected in some fields
(for example information on human rights), issues such as the
fight against terrorism, organised crime and drug trafficking
(pertinent as well to the third volet), requirements concerning
limitation of military capability and the specific item of non-proliferation,
settled after a thorough negotiation. 
<P>
The final paragraph of the volet invites us to consider &quot;any
confidence and security-building measures that could be taken
between the parties with a view to the creation of an area of
peace and stability in the Mediterranean, including the long term
possibility of establishing a Euro-Mediterranean pact to that
end.&quot; The concept of a pact, based on the proposal initially
presented by France of a &quot;stability pact&quot; for the Mediterranean
inspired by the model already existing for some central and eastern
European countries, has been included, with the support of the
British delegation, in the final document approved at the Cannes
European Council. The former option suggested by Spain was the
definition of a possible &quot;code of conduct&quot;. The French
idea, after an attempt during the negotiating phase in Brussels,
supported by other partners from both sides of the Mediterranean
to revert to a less compulsory formula (the term &quot;charter&quot;
used in the Marin document was suggested), was finally accepted,
omitting the word &quot;stability&quot;.<BR>

<P>
This was possible since all parties agreed on the necessity to
conclude the political and security volet with a concrete line
of action, stressing nevertheless the necessity of a gradual and
flexible approach in the realisation of the project, considered
as a point of arrival rather than of departure. Successive discussions
on the matter, showed that the future instrument was one of preventive
diplomacy (confidence and transparency building measures), in
the context of an increasing consultation mechanism among members
of the partenariat, rather than of crisis management. The option
of providing additional financial support was also mentioned.
<BR>

<P>
In view of the next meeting of Senior Officials responsible for
the political and security volet of the Declaration scheduled
for next week, it is important to underline how it is the first
occasion, after Barcelona, where the 27 parties will meet, as
indicated in the Working Programme approved in Barcelona. No particular
issue is inscribed in the agenda, taking in account the fact that
it is the first meeting of a series intended to prepare proposals
for the next meeting of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs scheduled
for April 1997 in one of the 12 third Mediterranean countries
(so far Morocco, Tunisia and Malta are candidates).<BR>

<P>
After an introduction of the Presidency, aimed at giving the general
orientations of the debate, the floor will be given to the 12
TMC, who apart from the points of view which they were able to
share during the visits of the Troika in the Maghreb countries
and in Egypt, have not yet had the opportunity to present concrete
proposals for the follow-up of this delicate and innovative aspect
of the partenariat. According to reports, the concertation meeting
that took place recently in Cairo among the TMC (plus Mauritania,
whose Minister of Foreign Affairs was invited in Barcelona), under
the chairmanship of the Arab League, gives no clear hint of what
the priority issues to be raised will be.
<P>
However, according to reports, security aspects will be included
in the suggestions to be presented (it is not clear at the moment
if Algeria will still act as porteparole for the Arabs as was
the case in Barcelona). One of the issues is probably non-proliferation
of weapons of mass destruction, as a clear sign of concern was
expressed in Cairo for the fact that control provisions in this
field apply only to Arab countries, whereas the capacity of production
lies mainly with another country. Taking into account the existing
disparity also in conventional arms the participants have underlined
the necessity to reinforce the principle of balanced and reciprocal
security in the region. A programme of action was set-up for a
coordinated follow-up of the process, to be enhanced also through
the organisation in may or June next of a Seminar among the concerned
parties.<BR>

<P>
It will be difficult in this framework to predict in which direction
the Senior Officials will proceed, particularly if thorny issues
raised in Barcelona, concerning mainly the peace process, are
raised again, even if assurances obtained in the course of consultations
seem to indicate that a constructive and positive approach will
prevail. <BR>

<P>
On the side of the European Union, bearing in mind the philosophy
of the process, the opportunity must be taken to identify at this
first stage which are the concrete initiatives on which a consensus
can be built (as a point of departure we have indeed the consensus
already achieved in Barcelona), in order to tackle at a further
stage the steps requiring a greater degree of confidence. From
the formal point of view this supposes that after a first exercise
intended to break the ice, as it were, the dialogue can evolve
gradually towards a more political consultation among equals.
<BR>

<P>
The security field where such a program can conveniently flourish
appears to be the one defined as measures and instruments of preventive
diplomacy, stressing both the political and the security aspect
of the suggestions that may stem from the mutual effort. On the
basis of a common definition of the concept of confidence and
security building measures, apart from transparency measures,
conciliation procedures can be also envisaged, for example in
the peaceful settlement of disputes, through the nomination of
conciliators. An appropriate field of application could also be
good neighbourly relations, to be promoted through the said mechanisms.
The question of weapons proliferation and compliance with existing
agreements can possibly benefit from the climate and could suggest
the setting up of specific working groups on the matter. <BR>

<P>
As far as the general approach is concerned there will be no pre-established
formulas or models offered from either side. This applies also
for the long term objective of a possible pact in the area, to
be considered as a useful step inscribed in the text of the declaration,
to be achieved bearing in mind the criteria of gradualism and
flexibility. On the matter a consultation with the TMC aimed at
obtaining reactions is currently being undertaken by France, as
the main supporter of the idea. In this context I also would like
to mention the Maltese proposal of a pact of stability in the
area, previously presented, as a useful element to be considered
in the framework of the Barcelona process. <BR>

<P>
As for the composition, the European Union will be represented
at the Senior Officials' meeting by all its 15 members, with a
formula differing from the one adopted, in application of the
Barcelona Declaration, in the case of the &quot;Euro-Mediterranean
comity for the follow-up of the Barcelona process&quot;, convening
in Brussels on the 15-16 April, in the format Troika plus 12.
<BR>

<P>
The question that arises about the prospects of security in the
Mediterranean after Barcelona as one of the themes of the colloquium
(the other one being co-operation) is the following: considering
the common objective of peace and stability in the area through
what instruments may it be reached, bearing in mind the existing
destabilising factors?
<P>
An answer is indeed not easy, and we do not purport to have any
magical formula, but perhaps a few considerations can be useful
to at least restrict the field of our examination. <BR>

<P>
The need for peace and stability being taken for granted, for
the destabilising factors, I would like to refer to a very useful
analysis conducted on that subject by the Institute for Foreign
Affairs (IAI) of Dr. Aliboni, whom we have the luck to count as
one of the participants of this colloquium. He defines in a recent
article on &quot;Mediterranean security after Barcelona&quot;
the (I quote) &quot;three main factors (of Mediterranean instability,
n.d.r) having a security impact on Europe: the quick demographic
reversal that is taking place around the basin between north and
south; the slow economic growth and the large unemployment which
prevail in southern Mediterranean countries; the political vacuum
coming from the inability of poorly legitimised Arab regimes to
broaden political participation and consensus and stop religious
extremism by integrating political Islam&quot;. The question formulated
in this respect in the same article is (I quote) &quot;whether
the Barcelona agenda fits in the European security expectations,
in particular whether it will be able to bring about political
stability on the southern shore of the Mediterranean&quot;. These
are the terms of the problem clearly and concisely enunciated
by the author. The solution does not consist he adds in &quot;exporting
democracy&quot; (&quot;democracy is not indeed an obvious notion&quot;
!) but in strengthening civil societies and replacing cultural
confrontation with dialogue. Among other factors contributing
to destabilisation, we must recall the non-proliferation issue
and other items increasingly on the agenda, such as environmental
matters.<BR>

<P>
In the assessment of the threat to the security of the region,
country cases cannot be ignored either. While the conflict in
former Yugoslavia represents a permanent source of instability,
other situations such as the ones involving Cyprus or Algeria
are to be mentioned, tough some progress has been noted in this
last country after the elections. Regarding Libya, and its non-involvement
in the Barcelona process, the possibility stressed in the Declaration
that other countries may join the partenariat leaves the door
open for Tripoli, to join in a hopefully near future whose demand
is increasingly supported by other Arab neighbour countries.<BR>

<P>
Coming to the main issue, that is the definition of the most appropriate
instruments contributing to maintaining conditions of stability
and security in the area, needless to say, they should be included
somehow in the framework of the Barcelona process, as the main
global instrument at our disposal, with an inevitable attraction
effect on all other fora. Concerning the operational follow-up,
the key-word in that context seems to be consultation, as a further
step in the comprehensive dialogue achieved among the participants
and as a prelude to a stage in which the degree of consensus can
lead to the adoption of a politically more binding instrument,
for example a pact among all parties.<BR>

<P>
In order to fill the gap represented by the lack in the security
aspects of the Euro-Mediterranean initiative of military CBMs,
as well as to encompass the need of a balance between the European
and transatlantic contributions, the proposal presented by Minister
Corcione in Williamsburg for a partnership for peace in the Mediterranean
could be needed, bearing in mind the differences with the east
and central European countries who are candidates to the enlargement
in the Alliance. Such an initiative - if duly prepared - could
contribute through specific transparency and confidence building
measures to a better understanding between north and south, removing
prejudice or forms of misunderstanding like the ones fuelled by
the hasty declarations of the former Secretary General of NATO.
In other words a strategy of gradual openness should replace in
the public opinion misperceptions of about a western conspiracy
or about the need to preserve a European or Atlantic fortress!
<BR>

<P>
Italy, due to its geostrategic position, is willing to contribute
through the organisation of a seminar, to the consolidation of
a similar perspective, also taking into account the benefits that
specific CSBM could produce in terms of the strengthening of south-south
dialogue and integration. The only condition is to avoid the involvement
of NATO in out-of-area operations.<BR>

<P>
A few conditions have however to be fulfilled for any initiative
to be concretely valid in the long term: the absence of setbacks
in the Middle-Eastern peace process, the involvement in the search
for a solution of a country, like the United States, which is
part of the strategic balance of the area, or like Russia whose
traditional quest for access to the Mediterranean cannot be simply
ignored. Another factor to be considered is the one regarding
the French interest in maintaining a certain profile in the region,
as the recent letter addressed by President Chirac to the Secretary
General of the Arab League proves.<BR>

<P>
We can easily predict that security in the Mediterranean will
stay on the agenda for a few years, if we consider the growing
regional interdependency from the strategic point of view. This
applies in the Mediterranean not only for countries like Malta
or Cyprus, which are candidates to EU membership, but also for
all the South Mediterranean. The feeling of a shared common future
concerns to-day the Nordics who are more interested in the Mediterranean,
asking us to reciprocate our concern for the Baltics. The huge
free trade area meant to involve Europe, west and east, as well
as its southern borders will forge many links among a very numerous
population. In the new Euro-Mediterranean enterprise we must be
careful to consider the cultures, traditions and beliefs of all
the parties involved, and at the same time ambitious enough to
realise in the Mediterranean a space of common ideals.<BR>

<H3>''Can we stamp out illegal drug crops in the Third World?''
</H3>

<P>
Despite the crackdown on illicit drug producers and dealers, increasingly
large areas are given over to the production of cannabis, poppies
and coca in the poorest regions of the Third World.
<P>
For a long time, these plants were sown or propagated for individual
consumption by the growers in the same way as many cereals, tubers
and fibre plants. Even today, many of the rural communities in
the &quot;Golden Triangle&quot; (Myanmar, Laos and Thailand) still
smoke opium for its analgesic effects in the event of severe pain.
Similarly, coca is traditionally grown in the low Andean valleys
of the Amazon Basin (Peru, Bolivia, etc.) for strictly medicinal
or religious purposes. Coca leaves, which are rich in vitamins
and minerals, are used to make herbal teas, providing a completely
legal remedy for altitude sickness. Coca leaves are also frequently
chewed by undernourished communities to stave off hunger.  Similarly,
khat is grown in Ethiopia and Yemen to suppress the hunger of
the poorest farmers, and enable them to work all day without too
much discomfort.  As for cannabis, it is often used to flavour
soups in south-east Asia, a practice which is in no way frowned
upon.
<P>
In recent decades, the farmers of the most isolated regions have
become involved in international trade.  The &quot;drug&quot;
plants which they used to grow for their own use, and to sell
in local markets, have now become true &quot;cash crops&quot;,
grown for export in the same way as tea, coffee and cocoa in other
parts of the world.  The sale of the drugs made from these plants
has not always been illegal; up until 1956 the French government
awarded itself the monopoly of the trade in opium from French
Indochina, via a body set up specifically for this purpose; the
<I>&quot;r&eacute;gie indochinoise de l'opium&quot;</I>, which
for a long time worked in a similar way to the <I>&quot;r&eacute;gie
des kifs et tabacs&quot;</I> in Morocco.  The fact is that new
outlets have been created by the internationalisation of trade
and the increasing demand for new derivative products (morphine,
heroin, cocaine, etc.), dealing in which is now strictly illegal.
<P>
Small Third-World farmers, whose equipment, in many cases, is
still manual (hoes, spades, picks, machetes, etc.), or drawn by
draught animals (ploughs, etc.), can no longer compete with cereal
farmers in large, industrialised countries whose farming methods
have long included mechanised, motor-driven and chemical systems.
 The productivity of poor farmers growing wheat, corn and rice
in inter-tropical regions is often a hundred times lower than
that of the major producers of the Paris Basin, the North-American
&quot;corn belt&quot; and the Mississippi Delta.  It is therefore
in the interest of many of these farmers to turn to the specialised
production of exclusively tropical commodities, for which there
is less direct competition from temperate regions, i.e. coffee,
bananas and rubber, but also opium and coca.
<P>
This kind of specialisation runs counter to the food security
of the populations in question, whose food is then largely dependent
on the importation of grain and flour which can be delivered for
less cost, even to the least accessible places.  However, it is
a direct result of the &quot;free&quot; trade policies followed
by governments and encouraged by international financial organisations
such as the IMF, World Bank, whose aim is to increase the variety
of types of agriculture in accordance with the &quot;comparative
advantages&quot; of different regions.  The problem is that the
most profitable products for export in the most remote regions
are, therefore, those for which a high price can be obtained for
the smallest volume possible, i.e. hashish, gum opium, cocaine
base paste, etc.  Is it not therefore contradictory to advocate
&quot;free&quot; exchange while at the same time prohibiting the
production and sale of commodities which best meet the criteria
of specialisation according to comparative advantages?  Is it
logical to impose the &quot;free&quot; importation of foodstuffs
on those whose production is declared to be &quot;illicit&quot;?
<P>
The fight against illegal drugs therefore presupposes that Third
World countries have the possibility of protecting their national
agriculture by means of tariffs (customs duty), in order to re-evaluate
(initially upwards) the price of food crops produced for domestic
markets.  However, this selective protection runs counter to the
structural adjustment plans recommended by international financing
organisations, and presupposes real political courage on the part
of the governments concerned, as the resulting rise in the cost
of food would first affect the urban population, who could be
expected to protest in anger at this.  However, this would be
much less traumatic than monetary devaluation, which would immediately
put up the cost of all imported goods, including equipment required
by farmers to update their farming methods.
<P>
Rural credit and input subsidy schemes must be resolutely implemented
to enable the poorest farmers to have access, at last, to the
equipment they need if they are gradually to increase their productivity
without adversely affecting the environment.  Real technological
research and development policies should also be encouraged for
those farmers in the poorest, most remote regions.  These farmers
need a relatively wide range of equipment, and must be able to
set up farming systems with high added value, combining rural
crafts, livestock and crop farming, without excessive specialisation.
 Priority must be given to anti-risk practices and to techniques
aimed at increasing the production of biomass and the recycling
of organic matter.  The increase in productivity obtained by using
new equipment should serve to generally increase the income of
farmers without resulting in the work force being driven out to
urban centres or virgin-forest areas.  In this way, the low-income
Andean farming communities would be able to improve their standard
of living without having to emigrate to the shanty towns of Lima
or La Paz or go down into the &quot;yungas&quot; to crush coca!
<P>
True land reform aimed at redistributing large estates to small
farmers would enable these farmers to set themselves up on the
most fertile land, which they have been deprived of for too long.
<P>
Productivity can be considerably increased by making intra-regional
transport easier.  All projects which aim to make it easier to
acquire beasts of burden, draught animals and carts serve to increase
production, and thus farmers' income, since the time saved in
travel and transport can be turned to good account in the fields,
for the direct purposes of production.  Facilitating intra-regional
trade between farmers whose productivity is much the same almost
always turns out to be more effective than opening up major roads,
the first result of which is to expose the least equipped farmers
to international competition.  Combatting the production of illicit
drugs presupposes that the ways in which small-scale farmers are
involved in trade are reconsidered so that these farmers can effectively
emerge from their &quot;underdevelopment&quot;.<HR>

<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P>
In the field of North-South relations, three subjects are the
source of considerable tension: migration, drugs and the environment.
 Recent South-North migration in the post-war period and migration
from country to town in the south were initially the result of
a demand for cheap, unskilled labour and then became a way of
escaping poverty.  This paper does not deal with migration as
such, although it underlies much of what is said since immigrants
and their descendants, the marginalised groups ''par excellence'',
have brought natural drugs with them into the developed countries,
passing on the drug-taking habit, acting as import and distribution
agents and making up a sizeable proportion of users.
<P>
The drug problem becomes an international one - Shanghai Conference
of 1909 - once production is sited in one location catering for
consumption in another - ie the West, or in other words once a
world drug market has been established.  In addition, the delocalisation
of drug production shows that the growing demand by the West over
the last thirty years (1) has been satisfied almost exclusively
by natural drugs such as marijuana, cocaine and opiates, whereas
synthetic psychotropic drugs would appear to have a marginal role
in the illegal use and supply of drugs, in spite of the considerable
development of these substances by the pharmaceutical industry
over the same period (2).
<P>
For developing countries, the &quot;naturalisation&quot;, as it
were, of the use of psychotropic substances and the fact that
they are produced on their own territory has made the drug problem
a largely agricultural one, falling outside the economy.  However,
the agricultural production of drugs has not been caused by international
demand for psychotropic substances alone; a contributory factor
has been the poverty in the rural areas of developing countries
and the failure of traditional forms of agriculture on which they
depend economically.
<P>
There are two aspects to the failure of agriculture in the developing
countries: (a) the loss of food security and (b) the increasing
plundering of their renewable natural resources.  Thus, at the
end of the last decade, out of the 207 countries recognised by
the United Nations, only 28 did not have a deficit in cereals:
13 of the 23 industrialised countries and 15 of the 184 developing
countries.  Of these only Argentina, Hungary, South Africa and
Thailand are exporters whereas the US, Canada, France and Australia
account for 85% of net cereal exports.  In the last ten years,
the world has lost 1.8% of its forests, with the US losing 1.1%;
Canada regained 5.8% and the European Union 3.4%, whereas South
America lost 4.6%, Africa 3.6% and Asia 5.3%.  Forests are therefore
being replaced with inefficient farming and stockbreeding (forestry
operations in fact account for only 1-3% of tree felling in the
developing countries).
<H3>Local impact of international policies</H3>

<P>
In response to the constant increase in the use of and demand
for psychotropic substances, control policies in the post-60s
period were focused predominantly on suppressing the supply (production
and trafficking) of drugs - which proved effective in the industrialised
countries.  The reaction from the drug traffickers has been delocalisation
of the production of psychotropic substances in relation to traditional
markets and naturalisation of consumption.  This has proved to
be a very effective strategy for controlling the risks of legal
sanctions and minimising the costs.  Although the unit cost of
synthetic substances is much lower than that of natural drugs,
the cost of investing in equipment, installations and raw materials,
skilled labour and pharmaceutical technology is considerable in
comparison with the cost of sub-contracting agricultural production
and small or large-scale extraction of natural psychotropic substances
(3).  Moreover, control of these unlawful activities by the criminal
courts is clearly much more lax in the developing countries where
corruption costs are lower.  In short, the delocalisation and
naturalisation of the production and consumption of drugs, which
create the illicit international market and give the developing
countries a role to play in it, are consequences of international
control policies which have put greater emphasis on cutting off
supply than on prevention and treatment of drug abuse.
<P>
The main feature of international agricultural trade, where technically
speaking the production and trafficking of natural drugs fit in,
is the continual fall in food prices  there has been a 50% drop
in the last forty years due to the fact that industrialised countries
have been subsidising farmers and livestock breeders over the
last twenty years, on average to the tune of 44%.  When international
agricultural prices fall below their production costs, farmers
in developing countries, who receive few or no subsidies, and
who furthermore have to compete on their local and national markets
with subsidised imports, have no other &quot;logical&quot; option
but to minimise production costs by cutting down on the use of
agricultural technology available, and then, if they wish to achieve
&quot;economic viability&quot;, to make extensive use of land
and water resources, constantly extending the area they use for
farming and destroying in the process the forests and biodiversity
found therein.
<P>
The general answer from developing countries to the agricultural
policies of the developed countries has been to abandon agricultural
technology and over-exploit renewable natural resources.  The
specific answer from those countries which have the necessary
soil and climate has been to produce natural drugs.  Furthermore,
the great paradox of drug production is that it has a smaller
impact on the environment, since it offers a higher market value
while using fewer natural resources.
<H3>Proposals for alternative polices: towards a new agenda</H3>

<P>
In international relations, the question of psychotropic drugs
has been approached in two different ways: first, the view prevalent
in the industrialised countries that consumption cannot be controlled
unless the supply  ie production in the developing countries 
is cut off; secondly, the view in the developing countries that
drug production and supply cannot be controlled while there is
still a demand in the industrialised countries.  Operationally,
both arguments are valid for the current illicit market, but conceptually,
they are inadequate since they overlook two basic explanatory
facts: (i) suppression of illicit production in industrialised
countries generates demand and (ii) the agricultural and environmental
crisis in developing countries generates supply.
<P>
The illicit production of psychotropic substances has not been
relocated from industry to agriculture in developed countries,
because farmers in those countries have not become impoverished
nor have rural areas been untouched by modern technology.
<P>
Neither the problem of the illicit production of natural drugs
nor the problem of protecting the environment and natural renewable
resources can be resolved outside the international agricultural
market.  The new agenda in North-South relations must deal with
the problem of the production of natural drugs and the plundering
of renewable natural resources in the developing countries in
tandem with the agricultural policies of the developed countries
based on subsidised agricultural production.  It is this which
has led to the developing countries losing their competitive advantages
and has turned them from food exporters into food importers.
<P>
It should not be forgotten that if the supply of natural drugs
and psychotropic substances were to be controlled effectively
but without any control on demand in the developed countries,
then consumers would resort to solvents, petrol and alcohol to
satisfy their desire or need to alter their state of consciousness
or behaviour in the same way as the marginalised and children
do today in the developing countries.  All these substances  alcohol,
psychotropic and natural drugs, solvents and petrol - have the
same function, the ability to satisfy needs.  Consequently, if
there is no real efficient and proactive way to prevent the desire
and deal with the need for psychotropic substances and the only
approach is to seek to suppress the problem, we will witness a
constant change in the pattern of use  naturalisation or artificialisation
 and delocalisation of the production of psychotropic substances
depending on what the situation is regarding the suppression and
illegal supply of these drugs.
<H3>Recommended strategies for a new agenda</H3>

<P>
Alternative development is the only possible strategy for controlling
illegal drug cultivation since it is only in this way that the
poor farmers in the tropical regions of the Third World can escape
from the stranglehold put on them by international drug traffickers.
 Only then will drug traffickers be obliged to take over the risks
and costs involved in directly managing illicit drug cultivation
(which has already happened in some areas of the Andes) or be
obliged to take over the substantial industrial and financial
risks involved in the production of synthetic drugs (which has
also recently been seen).  However, it is not possible to achieve
any significant successes with alternative development, ie lasting,
environmentally-sound successes which can continue indefinitely
if there is no change in the current conditions of the international
agricultural market, which depend on the agricultural policies
of the industrialised countries.
<P>
A strategy for action should present the ecological advantages
of alternative development over drug cultivation, showing the
devastating impact which the agricultural policies of the north
have on the south.  The areas where this needs to be brought home
are primarily the ecological movement and the authorities responsible
for the environment.  Debates on these issues have given greater
prominence to environmental problems which have a less serious
impact on nature or which entail fewer risks for humanity such
as the green label campaign for wood products, the ban on hunting
aquatic mammals, nuclear tests, etc. thereby glossing over more
important and threatening problems such as the destruction of
forests and steppes (land biodiversity) as a result of inefficient
farming and stockbreeding, the over-fishing of seas, rivers and
lakes (aquatic biodiversity) and the pollution caused by processing
of catches, the increasing pollution of all environments caused
by industrial, agricultural, household and other waste, etc.

<H3>''International Conventions: the need to stimulate debate
on drug policies and their enforcement''</H3>

<P>
NGOs should analyse the coherence between drugs and development
policies in general. Drugs policies should not only be based on
international conventions but on a profound analysis of the macro-economic
mechanisms to prevent harm caused by large scale production, trafficking
and use of drugs.
<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P>
There are two major problems:
<P>
a) Drug consumption, production and trafficking, which I shall
call collectively 'the drug phenomenon', appear to be increasing
in both North and South. This is despite the existence of international
conventions aimed at preventing the phenomenon, to which a large
number countries are signatories.
<P>
b) Drug control efforts are themselves producing negative side-effects
in many countries. These include consequences for human rights
and democracy, the environment and national self-determination,
(all important components in 'development).
<P>
This suggests a need to stimulate debate about drug-control conventions,
specific policies, and the functioning of drug-control agencies
which enforce them. In particular, two sets of issues or questions
need debating:
<P>
a) Concerning the failure of the conventions to prevent a global
increase in the drug phenomenon we need to ask whether the phenomenon
is increasing because:
<UL>
<LI>the current conventions are fundamentally flawed (i.e. different
conventions might prove more successful)?
<LI>the current conventions are sound but are inadequately enforced?
<LI>conventions alone - of any kind - are insufficient to control
a phenomenon which has deep societal, cultural and economic roots?
</UL>

<P>

<P>
b) Concerning the existence of negative side-effects we need to
ask whether they are:
<UL>
<LI>an inevitable result of the design of current conventions:
<LI>a product of the manner in which the conventions have been
interpreted in national legislation (i.e. not intrinsically the
fault of the conventions themselves)?
<LI>a result of the manner in which national legislation is enforced
in practice by drug-control agencies?
<LI>a combination of the above?
</UL>

<P>

<P>
The predominant view expressed by major international players
in drug control (US, UN, EU) is that the drug phenomenon persists
because the current conventions are inadequately enforced. While
officials may acknowledge that the phenomenon is linked to other
processes (macro-economic, social, etc.), in practice it is treated
as independent and self-generating. Questioning of the conventions
themselves appears taboo. Few governments seem prepared to acknowledge
that drug control activities present negative side-effects.
<P>
For many NGOs and other commentators, the conventions themselves
are seriously flawed. They are unlikely to succeed while little
attention is given to the other contributory factors which help
generate the drug phenomenon (such as rural poverty in the South
and social alienation in the North). Moreover the side-effects
are painfully obvious and their gravity calls into question the
wisdom and morality of current policies as well as the manner
of their implementation.
<P>
From this writer's point of view, therefore, behind the failures
and dangers of current drug conventions and policies lies a lack
of coherence between drug control policies and other policies
(economic, human rights, environmental, etc.).
<H3>Current policies and conventions</H3>

<P>
Let us look at the conventions, some of their characteristics,
and some features of the policies which derive from them.
<H5>Key global conventions are:</H5>

<UL>
<LI>the UN's Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs (1961) and its
Protocol (1972) [149 signatory states at November 1994]
<LI>the UN's Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs
and Psychotropic Substances (1988), known as the 'Vienna Convention'.
[103 signatory states at November 1994].
</UL>

<H5>Important characteristics of the conventions:</H5>

<UL>
<LI>they are based on judgements about the medical and moral dangers
of consuming certain natural and synthetised substances.
<LI>they seek to control the production, trade and consumption
of substances classified as dangerous.
<LI>they seek to achieve this control through the total legal
prohibition of some substances or the strict regulation and restriction
of others for approved medical purposes only.
<LI>they oblige states to penalise individuals who produce, trade
or use substances in a manner not approved of by the Convention.
</UL>

<H5>Important characteristics of policies</H5>

<UL>
<LI>National policies largely prohibit the substances proscribed
by the conventions, establishing penalties for those who contravene
national drug-control laws.
<LI>But there is great national and even local variation in the
nature and severity of the penalties set by the law.
<LI>There are also great variations, between nations and within
them, in the degree to which the law is actually enforced.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
From the developmental point of view, this gives rise to several
problems:
<H5>Problems with the conventions:</H5>

<UL>
<LI>they focus on the drug phenomenon as an independent primary
problem which causes others; they barely mention the fact that
it is highly interdependent with other variables (societal, cultural,
economic) and is as much a symptom of other factors. For example
in Latin America, economic adjustment packages and free trade
agreements (which typically reduce state expenditure on agricultural
promotion and cut tariff barriers on imported food), severely
disadvantage the peasant sector. This forces farmers into drug-linked
cultivation in order to survive. In both North and South, the
deregulation of financial markets facilitates money laundering.
And in the North, one factor in drug consumption is urban and
rural deprivation, itself caused or permitted by the interaction
of policies on employment, housing, education, etc.
<LI>The drug conventions have no control over these economic and
social processes which are powerful contributors to the drug phenomenon.
Thus the solutions they offer can only be partial, focusing more
on drug production and consumption <I>per se</I>, than on their
causes.
<LI>The conventions are inconsistent.They exclude certain addictive
and potentially lethal substances such as alcohol and tobacco
yet include other substances, such as the coca leaf, which is
harmless and possibly beneficial in its natural state. This inconsistency
encourages a diversion of effort towards reducing the production
and consumption of certain substances because they are illegal,
when the consumption of two legal substances, alcohol and tobacco,
poses a much more serious public health problem in most countries.
<LI>The conventions represent a particular (and not universal)
moral and cultural view-point as well as medical judgements which
are increasingly contested. This invites tension between states
as some attempt to impose their 'norms' and views on others. This
can be seen both within the North (eg France vs Netherlands) and
between the North and South (eg Bolivia vs Peru).
</UL>

<P>

<P>
From these follow several common components of current drug control
policies, which have serious developmental implications.
<H5>Problems with policies:</H5>

<UL>
<LI>the predominant focus on law enforcement: this has diverted
attention from the economic and social causes of the drug phenomenon
and thus must take some of the blame for the failure to produce
viable and attractive economic alternatives for cultivators of
drug-linked crops.
<LI>forced eradication of drug-linked crops: when demand for the
final drug remains constant, eradication tends merely to displace
illegal crop production to other areas. Moreover, eradication
may compound environmental damage: peasant cultivators with viable
alternatives may move further into forested areas, clear more
land, and replant. Fumigating crops from the air with chemicals,
may also damage soil, food crops and water systems.
<LI>strengthening law enforcement: introducing more severe anti-drug
legislation in both North and South has failed to reduce the drug
phenomenon. In many countries, such laws have undermined civil
rights such as the right to a fair trial. Moreover, where they
are enforced by police with little knowledge of or respect for
human rights norms, this leads to serious human rights violations.
Finally, 'getting tough on drugs' typically criminalises large
numbers of predominantly poor people. This tends to produce a
congestion of the legal system which then fails to cope with arguably
more serious crimes, as well as to inhumane prison overcrowding.
<LI>'militarising' drug control: strengthening law enforcement
by involving the military in drug control duties may risk even
more widespread human rights violations. It also jeopardises the
hard-won gains of democratic sectors in many developing countries
to regain control of the state from the armed forces, and to strengthen
civilian control over domestic law enforcement.
<LI>Conditioning foreign aid on 'drug-control performance': the
experience of the US conditioning aid to Bolivia, for example,
suggests that it may force governments to take risky actions of
questionable value merely to please the donor and avoid financial
penalties. The Bolivian government's drive to meet crop reduction
targets by forcibly eradicating coca without providing alternatives
to farmers, has increased human rights violations and provoked
protests which have threatened national stability.
</UL>

<P>

<H3>Alternative policies and practices</H3>

<P>
In the short term there are a range of options which should be
considered, within the framework of current conventions.This requires
attention to three broad areas as follows:
<P>
a) coherence of drug control policies with human rights norms:

<UL>
<LI>possible action:
<LI>ensure that national drug control legislation does not violate
international human and civil rights norms.
<LI>ensure that NGOs and other sectors of society in developing
countries are accorded a role in monitoring the use of foreign
drug-control assistance.
<LI>deny lethal drug-control assistance to forces (police or military)
with a record of human rights abuse.
</UL>

<P>
b) alignment of drug control policies with developed instruments;
<UL>
<LI>possible action:
<LI>Northern trade blocs (US, UE) could widen the scope of trade
preferences which they have offered to certain drug 'producer'
and 'transit' countries
<LI>Northern donors could direct their aid more effectively, to
help peasant farmers currently growing drug-linked crops to gain
better access to domestic and international markets for 'alternative'
products, including those eligible for preferences.
<LI>Northern blocs could give encouragement to fairly traded products.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
c) Coherence of drug control policies with economic and social
policies:
<UL>
<LI>possible action:
<LI>Northern countries which support drug control in developing
and Central / Eastern European countries could instruct the multilateral
financial institutions (IMF, World Bank, etc) to consider the
implications for drug control and poverty reduction of the economic
policies / packages which they promote.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
In the long term, there is a need for a widespread public and
political debate about the costs and benefits of the prohibition
of drugs, which is the foundation of the current conventions.
Getting official backing for such a debate would itself be an
'alternative policy' when governments currently tend to avoid
such discussion themselves, and criticise others who attempt it.
<P>
Central to this debate is a discussion of priorities. It needs
to be made clear that reducing the drug phenomenon will require
changes in other policies  (economic, social) which may go against
the grain of current orthodoxy in these areas. Thus publics and
politicians need to decide which is more important to them - effective
drug control or these other policies. The public must come to
realise that our own desires and attitudes are often contradictory.
For example, the 'average' Northern citizen would typically be
concerned by human rights abuse but demand 'tough action' against
drugs in the South. She or he may be concerned at poverty in the
South but simultaneously demand cheap food, little realising that
low prices in the North for certain imported commodities are a
cause of poverty in the South.
<P>
Secondly, publics and politicians must be made aware that we must
decide priorities even within the sphere of drug-control. Hypothetically,
for example, controlled legislation of drugs could lead to fewer
people dying from contaminated doses, less crime surrounding the
trade, but far greater numbers of people taking drugs. Continued
prohibition on the other hand may inhibit more people from trying
drugs but lead to many more deaths from impure or over-doses.
Which is preferable? When we have a greater societal discussion,
we are more likely to get a reasonable consensus which leads to
policies which are effective in their own terms.
<H3>Strategies to help bring about alternative policies</H3>

<P>
Some general suggestions on strategies:
<UL>
<LI>identify relevant fora: those interested in changing policy
must identify the bodies with authority over policies with implications
for the drug phenomenon, at international, national and local
levels. From the above, it should be clear that this includes
a much wider group than the United Nations Drug Control Programme
(UNDCP), national government and local police. It includes the
IMF, World Bank, World Health Organisation, numerous ministries
in each country, regional and local authorities, etc.
</UL>

<P>
build alliances: we should seek to build coordinated alliances
which together undertake the task of:
<P>
a) informing about and lobbying for the need for certain changes
within the parameters of current conventions;
<P>
b) promoting discussion about priorities in drug control, alternative
conceptions of drug control (non-repressive, non-prohibitionist,
etc.), and the possible need to revise the conventions themselves.
Key partners in this alliance might be institutions who are regarded
as non-party political, whose work touches on the issue of drugs,
and who carry some moral authority with the general public. Obvious
ones are domestic police forces and the Churches.
<UL>
<LI>promote informed debate / defend free speech: a key task is
to make it legitimate for politicians and others to speculate
about drug policy without suffering fierce criticism. This will
require a concerted effort by alliance to publicly defend the
right to freedom of thought and speech on drug issues and to demand
that drug policy should be de-politicised.
<LI>promote genuine North-South dialogue / resist conditionality:
promoting genuine dialogue (i.e. with no risk of punishment attached
to holding a different view) between countries, cultures and sectors
with very differing attitudes to and policies on the drugs phenomena.

<H3>Contribution by <A NAME="cabises">Hugo CABIESES </A>- Peru
</H3>

<H3>&quot;North-South relations and amendment of treaties as regards
the coca leaf&quot;</H3>

<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P>
In order to tackle the worldwide problem of drug trafficking and
drug abuse, this contribution proposes amending international
treaties.  Circumstances have changed since the adoption, in Vienna
in 1988, of the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic
in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances.
<P>
Among these amendments, I suggest a change in the status of the
coca plant, which is a natural resource, a cultural asset and
an ancestral &quot;Andean/Amazonian&quot; plant, but which is
regarded as a narcotic drug and is therefore included on the list
of psychotropic substances.  The 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic
Drugs, which prohibits their use for purposes other than scientific
or medical ones, lists not only cocaine but also the coca plant.
 This decision was taken following the report by the Board of
Enquiry which visited Peru and Bolivia in 1949; the merits of
that report have today been called into question.
<P>
Since 1988,  the Peruvian and Bolivian representations to international
bodies, in particular the Commission on Narcotic Drugs of the
United Nations' Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), have been
urging a review of the status of the coca plant.  Their proposal
has had its supporters and detractors among the various governments,
but coca plant growers in Bolivia, Colombia and Peru support the
proposal.  In 1991 they set up the CAPHC - Consejo Andino de Productores
de Hoja de Coca (Andean Council of Coca Leaf Producers) through
which they defend their belief, with weighty arguments, that coca
is not synonymous with cocaine, that coca plant growers are not
synonymous with drug traffickers and that a coca leaf user is
not synonymous with a drug addict.
<P>
Farming representatives and CAPHC representatives attended the
last three sessions of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs of the
United Nations ECOSOC in Vienna.  They proposed amending the treaties
as far as the coca plant was concerned.  I attended the sessions
in 1993 and 1994 and was able to put forward our views at the
latter meeting.
<P>
In 1995, Mr Evo Morales, the President of the CAPHC presented
our proposal.  I firmly believe that the most effective and peaceful
way of combatting cocaine trafficking is to withdraw the coca
plant from the list of psychotropic substances, and permit its
processing for beneficial ends, such as the rehabilitation of
drug addicts.
<P>
Paragraph 84 of the 1995 report by the Financial Action Task Force
on Money Laundering (FATF) indicates that the matter will be discussed
in Vienna during the session of 14-25 April.  The report adds
that the Task Force has repeatedly drawn the Commission's attention
to the fact that the opinions and practices of the governments
of Argentina, Bolivia and Peru with regard to licit and illicit
coca leaf production do not comply with the agreements under the
1961 Single Convention (paragraph 84).
<H3>Drug trafficking and the North-South context</H3>

<P>
The production, trafficking and consumption of drugs has become
a worldwide phenomenon and, contrary to the claim that could have
been made in the early 1980s, no country can seriously maintain
today that it remains untouched by the problem or that it is only
a consumer, or a supplier or a launderer of the proceeds of drug
trafficking.
<P>
The terrorist violence and institutional corruption caused by
these illicit activities are no longer confined to the cities
or the countryside of the South.  Responsibility is no longer
bilateral but multilateral.
<P>
Where drugs are concerned, we have moved on from a dependent world
to an interdependent world.  Until the 1980s, the international
division of labour, so to speak, in the drug trade was much more
specialised than it is today.  Specifically:
<P>
a) The raw materials of drugs, namely marijuana, opium poppies
and coca leaf, and the chemicals needed to process them were produced
in no more than 20 countries of the South, in the Andes, the Golden
Triangle and the Golden Crescent.  
<P>
b) Drugs produced in the South, mainly hashish, cocaine and heroine
in that order, were consumed in few countries of the North, and
chiefly in the United States and western Europe.  
<P>
c) The proceeds from drug trafficking were laundered in a few
tax havens, principally small Caribbean islands, and in the financial
centres of major cities in the most developed countries of the
South, such as Mexico City, Buenos Aires, Sao Paolo and so on.
<P>
d) Cartels, &quot;high risk entrepreneurs&quot;, had divided up
the drug trade: North Americans and Mexicans dealt in marijuana,
North Americans and Colombians in cocaine and Italo-Americans
and Afghans, Pakistanis and Thais in opium and heroine.  These
were distinct groups.
<P>
e) Most of the profits from these activities remained in the countries
of the North, and in particular in the hands of North American
and European mafias.  The farmers who grew the raw materials were
the worst off and ended up even poorer than before the boom in
the drug business.
<H3>The present situation</H3>

<P>
Now, in the mid-1990s, the situation is the following:
<P>
a) The raw materials and chemical products used to make drugs
are produced in countries of both the South and the North.  The
United States is currently the world's leading producer of marijuana,
while eastern Europe produces large quantities of opium and hashish.
 The opium poppy, which used to be a middle-eastern and south-east
Asian speciality, is now grown in Colombia, Mexico and Guatemala.
 Only the coca plant cannot be grown in any other region than
the eastern Andes.  At present, the chemicals used in drug production
are made in the North and exported to the South.
<P>
b) Consumption is no longer confined to the North.  Increasingly
large quantities of cocaine and opium paste are being consumed
in various countries of the South, particularly the bigger countries
in which poor people from rural areas are moving to the cities.
 Marijuana, however, was already in use in the South.  Drugs from
the South are less pure than those from the North and they are
consumed especially in the poorest urban areas.
<P>
c) Today the laundering of proceeds from drug trafficking is very
widespread.  Virtually the entire international financial system
is involved in these illicit activities.  Attempts by Northern
countries to combat laundering conflict with the interests of
the South, but also and especially with bankers in their own countries.
 There is an obvious contradiction between the freedom of capital
markets, which implies bank secrecy, and the need to control money
from questionable sources.  
<P>
d) Cartels have become international and worldwide.  Today more
than ever, as in any other international business activity, the
concepts of ''collaboration'', ''total quality'', ''research''
and ''flexible production'' have become the strongpoints of cartels
which have not only survived but have actually come through a
fruitless ten-year drug war stronger than ever.
<P>
e) The farmers who grow the raw materials for drugs are still
the bigger losers and are still be used as a bargaining tool between
North and South whenever the drugs question arise.  Their situation
has further deteriorated after more than a decade of promises
of ''alternative development''.  Unfortunately this has never
materialised, and the promises have been kept neither by governments
nor by international co-operation bodies.
<H3>Amending the treaties</H3>

<P>
In short, since the early 1990s, &quot;everyone does everything&quot;
in this high-risk business.  In both North and South there is
drug production, consumption and trafficking.  The phenomenon
has become increasingly multilateral.  Part of the basis of multilateralism
is the existence of and compliance with international treaties
which are accepted and respected by the parties.  International
treaties against drugs are characteristic of the United Nations,
and have existed since before 1944 when the United Nations was
founded.  It has become almost traditional for world conferences
on the subject of drugs to be held every ten or fifteen years.
 On these occasions conventions on drugs are amended to bring
them into line with new circumstances.
<P>
The most recent United Nations convention on drugs dates back
to 1988 when the ten year-old boom in cocaine was at its peak,
marijuana production was well established in California and opium
was not yet being produced in Colombia or Guatemala.  The Berlin
Wall had not yet come down, the Cold War was still a reality.
 But seven years on, it is clear that the convention must be amended
to fit with the times.  But it must be amended chiefly because
it is ineffective: all the measures it recommended to combat drug
trafficking and reduce consumption at the international level
have failed.  One of the amendments to be made to the Convention
is the status of the coca leaf as a narcotic drug, for which reason
it has been on the &quot;black list&quot; since the 1961 Single
Convention.
<H3>What am I proposing?</H3>

<P>
a) Coca is not synonymous with cocaine.  The coca plant grower
is not a drug trafficker.  The coca leaf user is not a drug addict.
 These proposals are very closely linked.  The fact is that we
are protecting a natural resource and two types of people, the
coca plant grower and the coca leaf user.  The international stigma
attaches not only to the product itself but also to the people
who grow it and use it.
<P>
b) The coca plant must be destigmatised, which means it must be
removed from United Nations list I.  To talk about decriminalisation
would not be appropriate here since my proposal could be confused
with the proposal to legalise drugs.  Our campaign in favour of
the coca plant is not in any way a first step towards the decriminalisation
of cocaine, marijuana or any other drug.  It is a mistake to equate
coca, opium and marijuana.
<P>
c) This campaign to reinstate the coca plant and to combat drug
trafficking and drug abuse must be waged on all fronts.  Everyone,
except drug traffickers and those who support them, must rally
to this worldwide cause.  This action in favour of the coca plant
must not be separated from action against drug abuse and drug
trafficking.  There are three battles, one for and two against,
battles which could help us to win a war in which we, the people
and governments of North and South, are all allies.  
<P>
d) At international level, action should begin with the Commission
on Narcotic Drugs of the UN ECOSOC, which has proposed that a
working party be set up.  Once the working party has produced
its report, the Commission on Narcotic Drugs will forward its
proposals to the General Assembly of the United Nations and the
Secretary General will order that a binding resolution be drafted.
<P>
e) The main arguments are scientific, and mainly medical and pharmaceutical,
ones.  Such arguments, which may or may not be correct, were behind
the inclusion of the coca plant on list I.  The evidence which
existed prior to the United Nations debates (1947-1953) is not
sufficient since science has made great advances in 50 years.
<P>
f) I am opposed to drug trafficking and drug abuse, just as I
am opposed to the two policies that are supposed to combat them,
namely the &quot;drugs war&quot; and &quot;alternative development&quot;
in producer countries.  Both policies have proved ineffective.
<P>
g) I am not in support of promoting coca, marijuana or opium poppy
production.  As far as coca is concerned, there has been a substantial
production surplus since the boom in cocaine use.  The two other
plants are not Andean crops and moreover, unlike the coca plant,
they destroy the environment.  At present, even if the coca plant
is removed from the list of narcotic drugs, the surplus needs
to be reduced by voluntary substitution.  I have proposed a model
of comprehensive sustainable rural development with the coca plant
(DRIS-C), and I have calculated that we must allocate no more
than 130,000 hectares to coca plant farming in Bolivia, Colombia
and Peru, for various medicinal and industrial purposes.  From
an agronomical and ecological point of view it is neither possible
nor desirable to increase or even maintain present coca farming
levels to meet the need for this beneficial natural resource.
<P>
Finally,  I maintain that the CAPHC, as an umbrella body for coca
plant producers and users has, and must have, priority place in
this action which must proceed at worldwide level, particularly
during this Decade of Indigenous People.
<P>
The farmers, settlers and indigenous peoples of the Andes who
grow the coca plant are the sole guardians of a resource which
is not only natural but also cultural, and which is an important
component of their vision of the world and their ancestral heritage.

<H3>''International Conventions: the need to stimulate debate
on drug policies and their enforcement''</H3>

<P>
NGOs should analyse the coherence between drugs and development
policies in general. Drugs policies should not only be based on
international conventions but on a profound analysis of the macro-economic
mechanisms to prevent harm caused by large scale production, trafficking
and use of drugs.
<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P>
There are two major problems:
<P>
a) Drug consumption, production and trafficking, which I shall
call collectively 'the drug phenomenon', appear to be increasing
in both North and South. This is despite the existence of international
conventions aimed at preventing the phenomenon, to which a large
number countries are signatories.
<P>
b) Drug control efforts are themselves producing negative side-effects
in many countries. These include consequences for human rights
and democracy, the environment and national self-determination,
(all important components in 'development).
<P>
This suggests a need to stimulate debate about drug-control conventions,
specific policies, and the functioning of drug-control agencies
which enforce them. In particular, two sets of issues or questions
need debating:
<P>
a) Concerning the failure of the conventions to prevent a global
increase in the drug phenomenon we need to ask whether the phenomenon
is increasing because:
<UL>
<LI>the current conventions are fundamentally flawed (i.e. different
conventions might prove more successful)?
<LI>the current conventions are sound but are inadequately enforced?
<LI>conventions alone - of any kind - are insufficient to control
a phenomenon which has deep societal, cultural and economic roots?
</UL>

<P>

<P>
b) Concerning the existence of negative side-effects we need to
ask whether they are:
<UL>
<LI>an inevitable result of the design of current conventions:
<LI>a product of the manner in which the conventions have been
interpreted in national legislation (i.e. not intrinsically the
fault of the conventions themselves)?
<LI>a result of the manner in which national legislation is enforced
in practice by drug-control agencies?
<LI>a combination of the above?
</UL>

<P>

<P>
The predominant view expressed by major international players
in drug control (US, UN, EU) is that the drug phenomenon persists
because the current conventions are inadequately enforced. While
officials may acknowledge that the phenomenon is linked to other
processes (macro-economic, social, etc.), in practice it is treated
as independent and self-generating. Questioning of the conventions
themselves appears taboo. Few governments seem prepared to acknowledge
that drug control activities present negative side-effects.
<P>
For many NGOs and other commentators, the conventions themselves
are seriously flawed. They are unlikely to succeed while little
attention is given to the other contributory factors which help
generate the drug phenomenon (such as rural poverty in the South
and social alienation in the North). Moreover the side-effects
are painfully obvious and their gravity calls into question the
wisdom and morality of current policies as well as the manner
of their implementation.
<P>
From this writer's point of view, therefore, behind the failures
and dangers of current drug conventions and policies lies a lack
of coherence between drug control policies and other policies
(economic, human rights, environmental, etc.).
<H3>Current policies and conventions</H3>

<P>
Let us look at the conventions, some of their characteristics,
and some features of the policies which derive from them.
<H5>Key global conventions are:</H5>

<UL>
<LI>the UN's Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs (1961) and its
Protocol (1972) [149 signatory states at November 1994]
<LI>the UN's Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs
and Psychotropic Substances (1988), known as the 'Vienna Convention'.
[103 signatory states at November 1994].
</UL>

<H5>Important characteristics of the conventions:</H5>

<UL>
<LI>they are based on judgements about the medical and moral dangers
of consuming certain natural and synthetised substances.
<LI>they seek to control the production, trade and consumption
of substances classified as dangerous.
<LI>they seek to achieve this control through the total legal
prohibition of some substances or the strict regulation and restriction
of others for approved medical purposes only.
<LI>they oblige states to penalise individuals who produce, trade
or use substances in a manner not approved of by the Convention.
</UL>

<H5>Important characteristics of policies</H5>

<UL>
<LI>National policies largely prohibit the substances proscribed
by the conventions, establishing penalties for those who contravene
national drug-control laws.
<LI>But there is great national and even local variation in the
nature and severity of the penalties set by the law.
<LI>There are also great variations, between nations and within
them, in the degree to which the law is actually enforced.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
From the developmental point of view, this gives rise to several
problems:
<H5>Problems with the conventions:</H5>

<UL>
<LI>they focus on the drug phenomenon as an independent primary
problem which causes others; they barely mention the fact that
it is highly interdependent with other variables (societal, cultural,
economic) and is as much a symptom of other factors. For example
in Latin America, economic adjustment packages and free trade
agreements (which typically reduce state expenditure on agricultural
promotion and cut tariff barriers on imported food), severely
disadvantage the peasant sector. This forces farmers into drug-linked
cultivation in order to survive. In both North and South, the
deregulation of financial markets facilitates money laundering.
And in the North, one factor in drug consumption is urban and
rural deprivation, itself caused or permitted by the interaction
of policies on employment, housing, education, etc.
<LI>The drug conventions have no control over these economic and
social processes which are powerful contributors to the drug phenomenon.
Thus the solutions they offer can only be partial, focusing more
on drug production and consumption <I>per se</I>, than on their
causes.
<LI>The conventions are inconsistent.They exclude certain addictive
and potentially lethal substances such as alcohol and tobacco
yet include other substances, such as the coca leaf, which is
harmless and possibly beneficial in its natural state. This inconsistency
encourages a diversion of effort towards reducing the production
and consumption of certain substances because they are illegal,
when the consumption of two legal substances, alcohol and tobacco,
poses a much more serious public health problem in most countries.
<LI>The conventions represent a particular (and not universal)
moral and cultural view-point as well as medical judgements which
are increasingly contested. This invites tension between states
as some attempt to impose their 'norms' and views on others. This
can be seen both within the North (eg France vs Netherlands) and
between the North and South (eg Bolivia vs Peru).
</UL>

<P>

<P>
From these follow several common components of current drug control
policies, which have serious developmental implications.
<H5>Problems with policies:</H5>

<UL>
<LI>the predominant focus on law enforcement: this has diverted
attention from the economic and social causes of the drug phenomenon
and thus must take some of the blame for the failure to produce
viable and attractive economic alternatives for cultivators of
drug-linked crops.
<LI>forced eradication of drug-linked crops: when demand for the
final drug remains constant, eradication tends merely to displace
illegal crop production to other areas. Moreover, eradication
may compound environmental damage: peasant cultivators with viable
alternatives may move further into forested areas, clear more
land, and replant. Fumigating crops from the air with chemicals,
may also damage soil, food crops and water systems.
<LI>strengthening law enforcement: introducing more severe anti-drug
legislation in both North and South has failed to reduce the drug
phenomenon. In many countries, such laws have undermined civil
rights such as the right to a fair trial. Moreover, where they
are enforced by police with little knowledge of or respect for
human rights norms, this leads to serious human rights violations.
Finally, 'getting tough on drugs' typically criminalises large
numbers of predominantly poor people. This tends to produce a
congestion of the legal system which then fails to cope with arguably
more serious crimes, as well as to inhumane prison overcrowding.
<LI>'militarising' drug control: strengthening law enforcement
by involving the military in drug control duties may risk even
more widespread human rights violations. It also jeopardises the
hard-won gains of democratic sectors in many developing countries
to regain control of the state from the armed forces, and to strengthen
civilian control over domestic law enforcement.
<LI>Conditioning foreign aid on 'drug-control performance': the
experience of the US conditioning aid to Bolivia, for example,
suggests that it may force governments to take risky actions of
questionable value merely to please the donor and avoid financial
penalties. The Bolivian government's drive to meet crop reduction
targets by forcibly eradicating coca without providing alternatives
to farmers, has increased human rights violations and provoked
protests which have threatened national stability.
</UL>

<P>

<H3>Alternative policies and practices</H3>

<P>
In the short term there are a range of options which should be
considered, within the framework of current conventions.This requires
attention to three broad areas as follows:
<P>
a) coherence of drug control policies with human rights norms:

<UL>
<LI>possible action:
<LI>ensure that national drug control legislation does not violate
international human and civil rights norms.
<LI>ensure that NGOs and other sectors of society in developing
countries are accorded a role in monitoring the use of foreign
drug-control assistance.
<LI>deny lethal drug-control assistance to forces (police or military)
with a record of human rights abuse.
</UL>

<P>
b) alignment of drug control policies with developed instruments;
<UL>
<LI>possible action:
<LI>Northern trade blocs (US, UE) could widen the scope of trade
preferences which they have offered to certain drug 'producer'
and 'transit' countries
<LI>Northern donors could direct their aid more effectively, to
help peasant farmers currently growing drug-linked crops to gain
better access to domestic and international markets for 'alternative'
products, including those eligible for preferences.
<LI>Northern blocs could give encouragement to fairly traded products.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
c) Coherence of drug control policies with economic and social
policies:
<UL>
<LI>possible action:
<LI>Northern countries which support drug control in developing
and Central / Eastern European countries could instruct the multilateral
financial institutions (IMF, World Bank, etc) to consider the
implications for drug control and poverty reduction of the economic
policies / packages which they promote.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
In the long term, there is a need for a widespread public and
political debate about the costs and benefits of the prohibition
of drugs, which is the foundation of the current conventions.
Getting official backing for such a debate would itself be an
'alternative policy' when governments currently tend to avoid
such discussion themselves, and criticise others who attempt it.
<P>
Central to this debate is a discussion of priorities. It needs
to be made clear that reducing the drug phenomenon will require
changes in other policies  (economic, social) which may go against
the grain of current orthodoxy in these areas. Thus publics and
politicians need to decide which is more important to them - effective
drug control or these other policies. The public must come to
realise that our own desires and attitudes are often contradictory.
For example, the 'average' Northern citizen would typically be
concerned by human rights abuse but demand 'tough action' against
drugs in the South. She or he may be concerned at poverty in the
South but simultaneously demand cheap food, little realising that
low prices in the North for certain imported commodities are a
cause of poverty in the South.
<P>
Secondly, publics and politicians must be made aware that we must
decide priorities even within the sphere of drug-control. Hypothetically,
for example, controlled legislation of drugs could lead to fewer
people dying from contaminated doses, less crime surrounding the
trade, but far greater numbers of people taking drugs. Continued
prohibition on the other hand may inhibit more people from trying
drugs but lead to many more deaths from impure or over-doses.
Which is preferable? When we have a greater societal discussion,
we are more likely to get a reasonable consensus which leads to
policies which are effective in their own terms.
<H3>Strategies to help bring about alternative policies</H3>

<P>
Some general suggestions on strategies:
<UL>
<LI>identify relevant fora: those interested in changing policy
must identify the bodies with authority over policies with implications
for the drug phenomenon, at international, national and local
levels. From the above, it should be clear that this includes
a much wider group than the United Nations Drug Control Programme
(UNDCP), national government and local police. It includes the
IMF, World Bank, World Health Organisation, numerous ministries
in each country, regional and local authorities, etc.
</UL>

<P>
build alliances: we should seek to build coordinated alliances
which together undertake the task of:
<P>
a) informing about and lobbying for the need for certain changes
within the parameters of current conventions;
<P>
b) promoting discussion about priorities in drug control, alternative
conceptions of drug control (non-repressive, non-prohibitionist,
etc.), and the possible need to revise the conventions themselves.
Key partners in this alliance might be institutions who are regarded
as non-party political, whose work touches on the issue of drugs,
and who carry some moral authority with the general public. Obvious
ones are domestic police forces and the Churches.
<UL>
<LI>promote informed debate / defend free speech: a key task is
to make it legitimate for politicians and others to speculate
about drug policy without suffering fierce criticism. This will
require a concerted effort by alliance to publicly defend the
right to freedom of thought and speech on drug issues and to demand
that drug policy should be de-politicised.
<LI>promote genuine North-South dialogue / resist conditionality:
promoting genuine dialogue (i.e. with no risk of punishment attached
to holding a different view) between countries, cultures and sectors
with very differing attitudes to and policies on the drugs phenomena.

<H3>&quot;North-South relations and amendment of treaties as regards
the coca leaf&quot;</H3>

<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P>
In order to tackle the worldwide problem of drug trafficking and
drug abuse, this contribution proposes amending international
treaties.  Circumstances have changed since the adoption, in Vienna
in 1988, of the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic
in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances.
<P>
Among these amendments, I suggest a change in the status of the
coca plant, which is a natural resource, a cultural asset and
an ancestral &quot;Andean/Amazonian&quot; plant, but which is
regarded as a narcotic drug and is therefore included on the list
of psychotropic substances.  The 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic
Drugs, which prohibits their use for purposes other than scientific
or medical ones, lists not only cocaine but also the coca plant.
 This decision was taken following the report by the Board of
Enquiry which visited Peru and Bolivia in 1949; the merits of
that report have today been called into question.
<P>
Since 1988,  the Peruvian and Bolivian representations to international
bodies, in particular the Commission on Narcotic Drugs of the
United Nations' Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), have been
urging a review of the status of the coca plant.  Their proposal
has had its supporters and detractors among the various governments,
but coca plant growers in Bolivia, Colombia and Peru support the
proposal.  In 1991 they set up the CAPHC - Consejo Andino de Productores
de Hoja de Coca (Andean Council of Coca Leaf Producers) through
which they defend their belief, with weighty arguments, that coca
is not synonymous with cocaine, that coca plant growers are not
synonymous with drug traffickers and that a coca leaf user is
not synonymous with a drug addict.
<P>
Farming representatives and CAPHC representatives attended the
last three sessions of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs of the
United Nations ECOSOC in Vienna.  They proposed amending the treaties
as far as the coca plant was concerned.  I attended the sessions
in 1993 and 1994 and was able to put forward our views at the
latter meeting.
<P>
In 1995, Mr Evo Morales, the President of the CAPHC presented
our proposal.  I firmly believe that the most effective and peaceful
way of combatting cocaine trafficking is to withdraw the coca
plant from the list of psychotropic substances, and permit its
processing for beneficial ends, such as the rehabilitation of
drug addicts.
<P>
Paragraph 84 of the 1995 report by the Financial Action Task Force
on Money Laundering (FATF) indicates that the matter will be discussed
in Vienna during the session of 14-25 April.  The report adds
that the Task Force has repeatedly drawn the Commission's attention
to the fact that the opinions and practices of the governments
of Argentina, Bolivia and Peru with regard to licit and illicit
coca leaf production do not comply with the agreements under the
1961 Single Convention (paragraph 84).
<H3>Drug trafficking and the North-South context</H3>

<P>
The production, trafficking and consumption of drugs has become
a worldwide phenomenon and, contrary to the claim that could have
been made in the early 1980s, no country can seriously maintain
today that it remains untouched by the problem or that it is only
a consumer, or a supplier or a launderer of the proceeds of drug
trafficking.
<P>
The terrorist violence and institutional corruption caused by
these illicit activities are no longer confined to the cities
or the countryside of the South.  Responsibility is no longer
bilateral but multilateral.
<P>
Where drugs are concerned, we have moved on from a dependent world
to an interdependent world.  Until the 1980s, the international
division of labour, so to speak, in the drug trade was much more
specialised than it is today.  Specifically:
<P>
a) The raw materials of drugs, namely marijuana, opium poppies
and coca leaf, and the chemicals needed to process them were produced
in no more than 20 countries of the South, in the Andes, the Golden
Triangle and the Golden Crescent.  
<P>
b) Drugs produced in the South, mainly hashish, cocaine and heroine
in that order, were consumed in few countries of the North, and
chiefly in the United States and western Europe.  
<P>
c) The proceeds from drug trafficking were laundered in a few
tax havens, principally small Caribbean islands, and in the financial
centres of major cities in the most developed countries of the
South, such as Mexico City, Buenos Aires, Sao Paolo and so on.
<P>
d) Cartels, &quot;high risk entrepreneurs&quot;, had divided up
the drug trade: North Americans and Mexicans dealt in marijuana,
North Americans and Colombians in cocaine and Italo-Americans
and Afghans, Pakistanis and Thais in opium and heroine.  These
were distinct groups.
<P>
e) Most of the profits from these activities remained in the countries
of the North, and in particular in the hands of North American
and European mafias.  The farmers who grew the raw materials were
the worst off and ended up even poorer than before the boom in
the drug business.
<H3>The present situation</H3>

<P>
Now, in the mid-1990s, the situation is the following:
<P>
a) The raw materials and chemical products used to make drugs
are produced in countries of both the South and the North.  The
United States is currently the world's leading producer of marijuana,
while eastern Europe produces large quantities of opium and hashish.
 The opium poppy, which used to be a middle-eastern and south-east
Asian speciality, is now grown in Colombia, Mexico and Guatemala.
 Only the coca plant cannot be grown in any other region than
the eastern Andes.  At present, the chemicals used in drug production
are made in the North and exported to the South.
<P>
b) Consumption is no longer confined to the North.  Increasingly
large quantities of cocaine and opium paste are being consumed
in various countries of the South, particularly the bigger countries
in which poor people from rural areas are moving to the cities.
 Marijuana, however, was already in use in the South.  Drugs from
the South are less pure than those from the North and they are
consumed especially in the poorest urban areas.
<P>
c) Today the laundering of proceeds from drug trafficking is very
widespread.  Virtually the entire international financial system
is involved in these illicit activities.  Attempts by Northern
countries to combat laundering conflict with the interests of
the South, but also and especially with bankers in their own countries.
 There is an obvious contradiction between the freedom of capital
markets, which implies bank secrecy, and the need to control money
from questionable sources.  
<P>
d) Cartels have become international and worldwide.  Today more
than ever, as in any other international business activity, the
concepts of ''collaboration'', ''total quality'', ''research''
and ''flexible production'' have become the strongpoints of cartels
which have not only survived but have actually come through a
fruitless ten-year drug war stronger than ever.
<P>
e) The farmers who grow the raw materials for drugs are still
the bigger losers and are still be used as a bargaining tool between
North and South whenever the drugs question arise.  Their situation
has further deteriorated after more than a decade of promises
of ''alternative development''.  Unfortunately this has never
materialised, and the promises have been kept neither by governments
nor by international co-operation bodies.
<H3>Amending the treaties</H3>

<P>
In short, since the early 1990s, &quot;everyone does everything&quot;
in this high-risk business.  In both North and South there is
drug production, consumption and trafficking.  The phenomenon
has become increasingly multilateral.  Part of the basis of multilateralism
is the existence of and compliance with international treaties
which are accepted and respected by the parties.  International
treaties against drugs are characteristic of the United Nations,
and have existed since before 1944 when the United Nations was
founded.  It has become almost traditional for world conferences
on the subject of drugs to be held every ten or fifteen years.
 On these occasions conventions on drugs are amended to bring
them into line with new circumstances.
<P>
The most recent United Nations convention on drugs dates back
to 1988 when the ten year-old boom in cocaine was at its peak,
marijuana production was well established in California and opium
was not yet being produced in Colombia or Guatemala.  The Berlin
Wall had not yet come down, the Cold War was still a reality.
 But seven years on, it is clear that the convention must be amended
to fit with the times.  But it must be amended chiefly because
it is ineffective: all the measures it recommended to combat drug
trafficking and reduce consumption at the international level
have failed.  One of the amendments to be made to the Convention
is the status of the coca leaf as a narcotic drug, for which reason
it has been on the &quot;black list&quot; since the 1961 Single
Convention.
<H3>What am I proposing?</H3>

<P>
a) Coca is not synonymous with cocaine.  The coca plant grower
is not a drug trafficker.  The coca leaf user is not a drug addict.
 These proposals are very closely linked.  The fact is that we
are protecting a natural resource and two types of people, the
coca plant grower and the coca leaf user.  The international stigma
attaches not only to the product itself but also to the people
who grow it and use it.
<P>
b) The coca plant must be destigmatised, which means it must be
removed from United Nations list I.  To talk about decriminalisation
would not be appropriate here since my proposal could be confused
with the proposal to legalise drugs.  Our campaign in favour of
the coca plant is not in any way a first step towards the decriminalisation
of cocaine, marijuana or any other drug.  It is a mistake to equate
coca, opium and marijuana.
<P>
c) This campaign to reinstate the coca plant and to combat drug
trafficking and drug abuse must be waged on all fronts.  Everyone,
except drug traffickers and those who support them, must rally
to this worldwide cause.  This action in favour of the coca plant
must not be separated from action against drug abuse and drug
trafficking.  There are three battles, one for and two against,
battles which could help us to win a war in which we, the people
and governments of North and South, are all allies.  
<P>
d) At international level, action should begin with the Commission
on Narcotic Drugs of the UN ECOSOC, which has proposed that a
working party be set up.  Once the working party has produced
its report, the Commission on Narcotic Drugs will forward its
proposals to the General Assembly of the United Nations and the
Secretary General will order that a binding resolution be drafted.
<P>
e) The main arguments are scientific, and mainly medical and pharmaceutical,
ones.  Such arguments, which may or may not be correct, were behind
the inclusion of the coca plant on list I.  The evidence which
existed prior to the United Nations debates (1947-1953) is not
sufficient since science has made great advances in 50 years.
<P>
f) I am opposed to drug trafficking and drug abuse, just as I
am opposed to the two policies that are supposed to combat them,
namely the &quot;drugs war&quot; and &quot;alternative development&quot;
in producer countries.  Both policies have proved ineffective.
<P>
g) I am not in support of promoting coca, marijuana or opium poppy
production.  As far as coca is concerned, there has been a substantial
production surplus since the boom in cocaine use.  The two other
plants are not Andean crops and moreover, unlike the coca plant,
they destroy the environment.  At present, even if the coca plant
is removed from the list of narcotic drugs, the surplus needs
to be reduced by voluntary substitution.  I have proposed a model
of comprehensive sustainable rural development with the coca plant
(DRIS-C), and I have calculated that we must allocate no more
than 130,000 hectares to coca plant farming in Bolivia, Colombia
and Peru, for various medicinal and industrial purposes.  From
an agronomical and ecological point of view it is neither possible
nor desirable to increase or even maintain present coca farming
levels to meet the need for this beneficial natural resource.
<P>
Finally,  I maintain that the CAPHC, as an umbrella body for coca
plant producers and users has, and must have, priority place in
this action which must proceed at worldwide level, particularly
during this Decade of Indigenous People.
<P>
The farmers, settlers and indigenous peoples of the Andes who
grow the coca plant are the sole guardians of a resource which
is not only natural but also cultural, and which is an important
component of their vision of the world and their ancestral heritage.

<H3>''Development aid: the record of development cooperation policies,
especially in substitution and alternative development''</H3>

<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P>
Illicit drugs production has become an increasingly important
development option in many developing countries. The demand for
drugs has enabled the establishment of an illicit sector; one
which is always searching for and finding places and mechanisms
which guarantee a maximum of benefits against a minimum of risks.
Structural poverty in producing countries is at the root of the
problem. The illegal sector is capable of doing what established
society is less and less capable of doing, that is it can offer
a perspective to those who do not have any, in this case, the
small peasant community. The extension of drug-linked cultivation
together with the growth of the sector involved in the manufacturing
and commercialisation of these drugs in developing countries is
directly linked to the severe socio-economic crisis that affects
these countries. The lack of development opportunities in traditional
rural areas and the destruction of the productive apparatus have
resulted in the migration of population towards the cities or
rural regions where development poles can be found which require
labour. In drug producing countries, these development poles are
based on the cultivation of plants used in the production of drugs.

<P>
Nevertheless, it would be a mistake to suggest that the price
received by a grower of opium in Burma, cannabis in Morocco, or
coca in Peru enables him to live well. In fact, these crops are
often the only profitable ones as the prices received for other
cash crops do not cover the production costs. 
<P>
It is therefore not surprising that the repressive strategy against
the cultivation of these plants, which is financed and implemented
under pressure mainly from the United States, has failed. It has
resulted in the so-called &quot;balloon effect&quot;, that is
the irrational extension of illicit cultivation towards areas
that are even more difficult to control. This, in turn, has brought
about counter-effective and undesirable effects such as the corruption
of institutions in charge of repression, the appearance of armed
movements that benefit from the social conflicts in order to obtain
control over the producing areas and the environmental damage
produced by the methods to eradicate illicit cultivation.
<P>
In comparison, the strategy of alternative development is a much
more positive answer to the problem. This strategy implies providing
concrete measures which favour alternative development options
to those related to drugs. This strategy can be applied both in
producing areas, and in areas where migration takes place. It
consists both of the creation of production lines and the establishment
of the necessary technical and social infrastructure to increase
the living standards of the local population.
<P>
Unfortunately, the results of the alternative development strategy
have, in most cases, been disappointing. More than once, it has
had counter-productive results, leading to an increase in drug-linked
cultivation. Even in the areas where projects have been successful
in reducing drug-linked cultivation, there is no evidence that
they have had any impact on the phenomenon of drugs trafficking
in general.
<P>
There are various reasons for this, both external and internal
in character. What is needed is a profound analysis of these reasons
leading to a series of necessary measures aimed at improving the
impact of alternative development strategy.
<H3>Current policies</H3>

<P>
The alternative development strategy is implemented through programmes
and concrete projects that are financed mainly by the developed
countries in the form of bilateral, multilateral and, to a lesser
degree, NGO assistance. A large part of that aid, especially that
given by the European Union and its Member States is being coordinated
within the framework of a specialised UN Agency, the United Nations
International Drug Control Programme (UNDCP). These programmes
started in the 70's and, since then, have been implemented in
the most important drug producing regions: the Golden Triangle
and Crescent of Asia, the Andean region of Latin America and in
some African countries.
<P>
The difficulties presented by the implementation of these programmes
are above all related to the fact that there is a lack of coherence
between the programme and the judicial and political contexts
they have to be executed in. On one hand, the programmes are implemented
in such as way as to satisfy the requirements established by the
International UN-Conventions on narcotic drugs (those of 1961,
1972 and 1988 respectively). These Conventions clearly mention
the need to eliminate the cultivation of prohibited substances
such as coca leaves, poppy and cannabis for non-medical purposes.
This implies that the target population of the alternative development
programme is considered to be violating the law, which hinders
the relation of mutual trust necessary between the two partners
in a development programme, ie the executors and the beneficiaries.
Without this trust, sustainable development is impossible. On
the other hand, the programme is executed within a context in
which a general rural development policy is virtually absent.
Conversely, many of the countries in question implement economic
measures that seriously affect the already marginalised rural
sector, such as the abolition of state support to the peasants,
the liberalisation of trade in agricultural products, etc. These
measures take place within the framework of a structural adjustment
programme elaborated by institutions that support the restructuring
of the economic policy of countries with an external debt, like
for instance the IMF, World Bank etc.
<P>
Finally, the economic policies implemented by developed countries
provoke an increased marginalisation from the global economy of
the peasant sector concerned, as a result of the low and fluctuating
commodity prices for their products and the unfair competition
caused by the flood of subsidised food imports to the national
peasant produce in developing countries. This phenomenon has gravely
damaged the perspective of the national productive apparatus in
general, and substitution programmes in particular.
<P>
Furthermore, serious criticism has been raised with regard to
the way in which the alternative development strategy has been
implemented by the concerned agencies, among others, the UNDCP.
This criticism refers to the fact that no distinction has been
made between cultivation for traditional use and cultivation for
drug production; that the dimensions of these programmes are often
exaggerated, with a disproportionate amount of funds being spent
on non-productive items and that their approach often fails to
foresee possible negative socio-economic and ecological outcomes.
There is evidence for example that the introduction of cash crops
as a result of alternative development programmes has generated
irreparable damage to the eco-system and to the traditional socio-economic
patterns of the population, which is, in most cases, indigenous.
Other crucial and consistent elements in this criticism of current
alternative development programmes are the lack of participation
by the target population in decision-making processes, as well
as the lack of coherence within a policy that promotes the commercialisation
of the alternative products.
<P>
In short, the alternative development strategy appears to be more
concentrated on the substitution of plants and less on the substitution
of rural poverty.
<H3>Alternative policies and practices</H3>

<P>
There is no doubt that the alternative development strategy, if
applied in an appropriate manner, is a positive answer to the
fundamental problem that lies beneath the massive production of
drugs, i.e. rural poverty. In order to  make the strategy more
effective in this sense, it is indispensable to establish a coherent
alternative development policy, whose main objective is not the
eradication of plants, but the eradication of poverty. This policy
has to aim at substituting the dependency on standard or illicit
mono-cropping, which actually characterises the situation of many
peasants in developing countries. In order to obtain this objective,
the policy should have international, national and local implications.
<P>
In the international sphere, promoting alternative development
requires the countering, in all appropriate fora, of the increasing
marginalisation of the small peasant sector in developing countries.
This can be done by addressing the adverse impact on this sector:
<UL>
<LI>of the low and fluctuating prices that their products are
subject to on the world market;
<LI>of the measures taken in the framework of the structural adjustment
programme, imposed by international financing institutions;
<LI>of the export of subsidised food products by developed countries
to developing countries.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
Furthermore, the alternative development strategy should not be
related to the execution of the International Conventions on Drugs,
which prohibit the cultivation of plants that can be used for
the manufacturing of drugs; conversely, the degree should be considered
in which this prohibition impedes the implementation of development
programmes, whose principal protagonists should be the growers
of these plants (at present considered as criminals by the International
Conventions).
<P>
On a national level, alternative development programmes should
be integrated in a rural development plan, that covers all areas
with a potential for agriculture. This plan should seek to obtain
economic progress for all, including credit, extension activities,
investigation and transference of new and adequate technologies,
and at the same time, adapt the model of self-sufficiency and
traditional technology, using it as a foundation of the economic
structure. Obviously, this rural development plan should also
include measures to protect national production, and above all
agricultural production, against competition from abroad.
<P>
On a local level, the approach of an alternative development programme
should be integrated, aiming at an economic model that enables
the target population to assure themselves fair incomes in the
framework of sustainable activities (with commercial perspectives
and respecting the environment). Therefore, the stability of the
peasants and their communities should be a first priority.
<P>
The foundation of the productive strategy should be food security,
with production for the local, national and international markets,
respectively, as its main production lines. On the international
market fair-trade products should be promoted. In the case of
agro-industrial projects, these should be articulated to the above-mentioned
priorities, and designed and implemented on the basis of profound
feasibility and marketing studies.
<P>
Under no circumstances should a production model be applied that
is damaging the local genetic biodiversity. As a consequence,
the cultivation of plants actually submitted for international
prohibition should be included among various possible production
lines, benefitting from the juridical possibilities that the current
Conventions might offer. For this purpose, investigations should
be carried out in order to determine potential beneficial applications
that these plants might have, also within an international context.
<H3>Strategies</H3>

<P>
In order to carry out a policy of alternative development, the
involvement and collaboration of two actors are indispensable:
the target population and the bilateral and multilateral agencies
in charge of financing and implementing the programmes. It is
very unlikely that all the changes suggested in the current alternative
development policy will occur soon. But already, the institutions
that implement it should carry out a critical evaluation of their
approach in close collaboration with the non-governmental organisations
that represent the target population, peasant organisations, and
local development organisations. According to the recommendations
that will result from this evaluation, the current programme should
be reformulated. Furthermore, in every possible degree, damage
caused by programmes that have already been concluded should be
repaired.
<P>
In order to improve the impact of alternative development programmes
in the future, these should be carried out with the agreement
and full participation of the target population in every phase
of the programmes: design, planning, implementation and evaluation.
To make sure that this participation is equitable, the programme's
objectives should be limited to the search for real development
options, and before these are found, no forced eradication of
illicit plants should be considered. In turn, investigations should
be carried out, together with specialised organisations, into
the way in which the commercialisation of beneficial derivatives
of these plants could open possible production lines.
<P>
The economical sustainability of the projects is to be guaranteed
by support to peasant organisations that enables them to maintain
optimum levels of development after the conclusion of the project.
On the other hand, local independent research organisations specialised
in development and environment should be supported in order to
monitor constantly the ecological and economical sustainability
of the development programme as it occurs. When the destination
of the products, prompted by an alternative development programme,
is the export market, international non-governmental organisations
that are in charge of so-called 'fair trade' schemes should be
contacted. This requires that peasant organisations should participate
in the control over the commercialisation and transformation of
their products, thus avoiding the possible undermining effects
of development on the essential food self-sufficiency activities.
<P>
Nevertheless, there is enough reason to doubt the sense that any
alternative development programmes might have if the macro-economic
measures are not taken to offer a market for the products it wants
to promote. These measures fail under the responsibility of the
supranational institutions.
<P>
The World Trade Organisation should eliminate the adverse impact
of the increasing liberalisation of international trade on the
small peasant sector, for instance through the establishment of
minimal and stable prices for the products that might be an option
for alternative development programmes. Financial institutions
like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund should
give priority to the elaboration of a rural development plan,
whose objective is to reactivate the agricultural sector based,
above all, on the fulfilment of local and national needs.
<P>
It is suggested that an institution like UNDCP, with the experience
and prestige it has obtained as being the UN specialised agency,
be the natural actor to suggest to the international community
the immediate need for adopting these measures. Furthermore, UNDCP
should, together with organisations specialised in the issue,
monitor global economic and financial policies, in order to give
sufficient warning of their possible adverse impact on the increase
of the drugs economy.<HR>

<H3>''Features of the production and economic integration of illicit
crops''</H3>

<P>
The production of illicit crops is concentrated in backward or
developing economies.  This is the case with the poppy in Afghanistan,
Pakistan and Burma, the coca leaf in the high forests of the Andean
countries of Bolivia, Peru and Columbia and, more specifically,
within the framework of agricultural subsistence economies in
which other crops are not profitable.  
<P>
These illicit crops constitute the raw materials for the production
of drugs, for example the coca leaf for cocaine.  Although the
peasant producers are improving their living conditions, they
remain impoverished, and the &quot;coca-cocaine&quot; circuit
has a very significant economic impact on the overall economy
of these countries, creating employment and bringing in foreign
currency.
<P>
In many cases, the increase in the production of illicit crops
has coincided with periods of economic crisis and structural adjustment
policies.
<P>
The supply of illicit crops is in response to the pressure of
demand from the international market.  In this fashion, certain
countries are able to reintegrate into the world economy.  The
globalisation of the economy has an adverse impact on raw materials
as such on the economies of the South.
<P>
The imbalances that result from the production and processing
of illicit crops in the economies of countries affected by these
activities will take a long time to overcome. 
<H3>Concept of alternative development</H3>

<P>
The United Nations International Drug Control Programme (UNDCP)
defines alternative development programmes as follows:
<P>
These are programmes created to promote the efforts of developing
countries to eliminate the production or processing of illicit
drugs in their territory.  Such programmes may assist governments
in setting up and designing alternative socio-economic policies
for peasants involved in the production of illicit crops and raw
materials.  They may facilitate and further the transition of
an entire country from economic dependence on production and trafficking
to a development strategy based on products other than narcotic
drugs.
<P>
At the Berlin Conference, a concept was proposed similar to the
one above: alternative development is defined as a process designed
to eliminate and prevent the production of crops intended for
the manufacture of illicit drugs by rural development measures
specifically designed to sustain national economic growth.  It
must include social and economic measures and must also be based
on the gradual reduction of crops in the drug growing regions
through easily accessible technical and financial assistance.
<P>
For its part, the American administration takes the position that:
it is generally possible to gauge success as a function of the
reduction of the production of and trafficking in narcotic drugs.
 However, the alternative development process is a long-term project,
and consequently, it is neither useful nor appropriate to measure
&quot;short-term&quot; success, such as the reduction in production
from one year to the next. 
<P>
The Government of the United States assesses the success of alternative
development on the basis of:
<P>
i. the number of licit jobs compared to the number of jobs in
coca cultivation;
<P>
ii. income from licit activities as against income from coca cultivation;

<P>
iii. total legally-generated foreign currency as opposed  to foreign
currency originating in coca plant production.
<P>
The Bolivian Government declares in its &quot;national strategy
for alternative development&quot; that it proposes to replace
the economy of the coca plant and its derivatives through the
creation of jobs generating income that will be able to make up
for the loss of employment and of revenue from illegal activities.
 Alternative economic development aims to offset with rapid financial
assistance, the social and economic cost of programmes to destroy
illicit coca crops and will also promote the structural change
needed to overcome the external asphyxiation to which the economy
of the country will be exposed as a result.
<P>
It is clear that there is no standard criterion, at any rate in
relation to the three following subjects:
<P>
1. Is only the income generated by crops to be replaced or the
economic activities created by the entire circuit?
<P>
2. Must the results be measured as a function of the surface area
of destroyed crops or on the basis of socio-economic parameters?
<P>
3. Is there a close correlation between the eradication of illicit
crops and drug demand?  Also, what role is played here by the
consumer countries?
<H3>Investments and markets</H3>

<P>
Investments for alternative development (in millions of US dollars,
for 1984-1995)
<P>
<B>     Bolivia  Peru   TOTAL</B>
<P>
<B>Government</B>   28.8   20.4   49.2
<P>
<B>USAID</B>    79.1   29.8   108.9
<P>
<B>UNDCP</B>    42.3   39.1   81.4
<P>
<B>Total</B>     150.2   74.1   239.5
<P>
Estimates based on data from the &quot;Andean Counter-Drug Initiative&quot;,
UNSAID - Bolivia, UNDCP Peru and Bolivia.
<P>
As we can see from this table, investments are low.  In the case
of Bolivia, for example, they amount to an average of 13 million
dollars annually; even if the 50 million dollars spent on destroying
25,000 hectares of coca plants were added, the annual average
would still be only 18 million dollars.  If this is compared with
the income generated by the coca plant and its derivatives, which
for Bolivia is estimated at 500 million dollars and for Peru at
2,000 million dollars annually, it is fair to say that these investments
are negligible.  As to the markets of the countries of the North,
they are blocked by quasi-tariff measures, which prevent any importation
of crops legally grown in the countries of the South.
<H3>Results</H3>

<P>
By and large, the results are limited, whether for job creation,
the generation of foreign currency or crop substitution.
<H3>The case of Bolivia </H3>

<P>
In Bolivia, alternative development has not had an effect for
three reasons:
<P>
i. modular projects that are small in scale and without economic
impact;
<P>
ii. little peasant participation;
<P>
iii. technical mistakes relating to the types of substitution
crops and markets envisaged.
<P>
In the years 1984-1989, attempts were made to resolve these problems,
notably in the agro-industrial units of UNDCP, so as to achieve
better quality and raise peasant participation.  The infrastructure
was improved somewhat.
<H3>The case of Peru</H3>

<P>
In the case of Peru, alternative development has been concentrated
primarily in the region of traditional production.  The violence
in the region of Huallaga has made it impossible to encourage
alternative development in the largest areas. However, in the
past two years, 1994-1995, cocoa and cocaine production has faced
a crisis of overproduction and a collapse in prices, in some cases
exceeding 300%.  This might stimulate the cultivation of alternative
crops - see the example of cocoa and its industrialisation, which
has benefited from the experience of and infrastructure developed
by the UNDCP.
<H3>The case of Colombia</H3>

<P>
The case of Columbia is somewhat unique because of its initial
situation as a country that processed drugs from the raw material
grown in Bolivia and Peru.  In the past two years, however, coca
production in Colombia has increased in surface area, from 30,000
to nearly 80,000 hectares.  In this new context, efforts are being
made to give fresh impetus to alternative development.  In the
past, projects receiving the special support of the UNDCP, and
which have been administered by the Government of Colombia in
the regions of southern Cauca, Piamonte de Putumayo, San Jos&eacute;
de Guavire and in Nari&ntilde;o have accounted for an investment
of 20 million dollars.
<H3>The current situation</H3>

<P>
Despite all the experience accumulated in the area of alternative
development, and notwithstanding the official declarations in
1995 of the Governments of Peru, Columbia and Bolivia, alternative
development policies have given way to the forced eradication
of coca crops.  The resulting situation of violence has created
an obstacle to the smooth functioning of alternative development
projects.
<H3>Problems to be raised</H3>

<P>
1. If long-term policies are involved, the results must be measured
with socio-economic parameters, which are not only meaningful
for over a long period.  If short-term policies are to be employed,
the sole measure would be the reduction of the number of hectares
of illicit crops.
<P>
2. Investment is insufficient.  The markets are limited by protectionist
measures, particularly those of a quasi-tariff nature.  In this
context, how can shared responsibility and the policies of the
North find their expression?
<P>
3. How can the contradiction be resolved between extremely open
economies and the free market, on the one hand, and the participation
of state and international bodies intervening in the alternative
development economy, on the other?
<P>
4. How can a consensus be reached with the coca-producing peasants,
if at the same time a sort of war has been declared against them?
 The forced destruction of their crops by fumigation is a threat
to human lives and to the environment.  
<P>
5. If we are aware that the problem is worldwide, how can demand,
which drives the supply, be reduced?

<H3><A NAME="lemmers">Jos Lemmers </A>, Executive Director of
the North-South Centre of the Council of Europe<BR>
</H3>

<P>
Since its creation in Lisbon, in May 1990, the European Centre
for Global Interdependence and Solidarity of the Council of Europe
- the North-South Centre - has been committed to promoting a global
partnership dialogue on key issues of global interdependence reflecting
the many relations and complex inter-linkages of Europe with other
continents.<BR>
In this respect, the Centre organised several international gatherings
such as the International Colloquy on Democracy and Human Rights
in 1992, the International Encounter on the Role of Women in an
Interdependent World in 1993, the International Conference on
Rwanda in its Regional Context: Human Rights, Reconciliation and
Rehabilitation in 1994, and its first Consultative Assembly in
1996 on the theme &quot;Europe's Role for Greater Solidarity in
an Interdependent World&quot;.<BR>
The unique system of quadripartite co-management of the Centre
by parliamentarians, governments, non-governmental organisations
and local and regional authorities - the <I>quadrilogue </I>-
provides the possibility for a permanent dialogue and exchange
of experiences among people and institutions with different points
of view. The role of the Centre is to bring them together and
to create the circumstances which allow them to communicate, listen
and learn from each other, and to benefit from each other's complementarities.
In this framework, the North-South Centre's Executive Council
decided to convene an International Conference on &quot;Drugs:
Dependence and Interdependence&quot; which will take place in
Lisbon from 23 to 25 March 1996.<BR>
The Conference is organised in partnership with the Brussels based
Environment and Development Resource Centre. This important encounter
will bring together representatives from the four quadrilogue
partners of the Centre and will gather participants from all over
the world who are experts on drugs issues in relation to different
fields of global interdependence: development, environment, social
affairs, health, prevention, information and education, among
others. The drug issue reflects a cruel interplay of market forces
and organised crime in our increasingly interdependent world.
It imposes itself as a self-reinforcing spiral on local communities
in North and South where consumption and production, addiction
and &quot;dealing&quot; have become intertwined daily realities.
The problem has even spread to the official economy and spill-over
effects, through bribes and corruption, have been recorded in
those very sectors and institutions which were designed to control
and fight it.<BR>
Today there is growing awareness that no single element of this
multi-dimensional question should be examined in isolation and
that only a comprehensive and multilateral approach, taking into
account its complex and interdependent nature, will enable society
to come to grips with the issue at root level.<BR>
Incoherent, often even contradictory, measures at micro-level
by a multitude of actors and institutions would seem bound to
fail in the face of a powerful maze of organised forces which
reap the benefits of production and marketing in defiance of sovereignty
or the rule of law. In order to stimulate the debate, experts
from different countries have submitted contributions to the Conference
on the different themes which will be discussed in the working
groups.<BR>
For each theme there is, in most cases, one contribution from
Europe and one from the &quot;South&quot;. These papers, submitted
under the sole responsibility of the authors, reflect experts'
points of view on different questions which will be debated during
the Conference. It is hoped that this procedure will contribute
to lively discussions resulting in practical recommendations based
on a multilateral approach in the quest for lasting solutions
to the drugs problem in an interdependent world<HR>

<H3>The role of Citizens' Associations</H3>

<P>
In the search for international strategies to deal even more effectively
with the issue of drugs, attention needs to be given to the potential
role of citizens and citizens' associations in both the debate
in Europe on the global drug phenomenon and in the implementation
of new European strategies. Because of their long-term experience
in the field, citizens' associations in Eastern and Western Europe,
and their partners in the South, possess valuable knowledge of
the root causes and effects of the drug phenomenon and of the
impact of the current drug control strategies in both producer
and consumer countries. European citizens' associations have several
motives for their initiatives in this field. First, there is the
need to respond to requests from our partners in the South, who
are daily confronted with increasing drug related problems including
those resulting from drug control strategies implemented by European
and international authorities. Secondly, citizens' associations
consider it almost impossible to obtain real, sustainable development
without taking into consideration effective measures towards drug
supply and demand issues. Finally, the setting of the drug issue
in its global, North-South and East-West context is an important
tool in development education activities in which European citizens'
association are involved. In short, strategies and policies to
combat drug-related problems will not be effective unless citizens
are directly involved in designing those strategies and policies
and in implementing them. And it is especially in the areas of
public awareness building and formal and informal education that
citizens' associations can be most effective.
<H3>Establishing a European NGO Council on Drugs and Development
<BR>
</H3>

<P>
With this in mind, an initiative was taken in Paris, in April
of 1993, when a small group of mostly development oriented European
NGOs decided to work together toward the creation of a European
NGO Council on Drugs and Development. The work toward the establishment
of the Council has been a concrete expression the wish to create
an instrument for European NGOs to contribute to the debate on
a more effective European policy on the drug issue and seek mechanisms
which will also enable NGOs in developing countries to put forward
their concerns and views to policy makers in Europe. In working
to establish a European NGO Council on Drugs a list of possible
principal themes which the Council could address was developed.
These themes will be the basic elements of the dialogue which
the Council will want to promote - among its own members, with
the wider NGO community and with the concerned international institutions,
including the European Union and the Council of Europe. These
are also the themes of the Lisbon International Conference on
Drugs: Dependence and Interdependence. It is our hope that the
Lisbon conference will make a significant contribution toward
more coherency between drugs and economic policies and that those
policies will embrace broader issues in an integrated approach
involving citizens' organisations, especially indigenous groups
in developing countries, in the formulation and implementation
of relevant programmes and projects. It is also our hope, indeed
our intention, that the Lisbon conference will be an important
step toward the creation of the proposed European NGO Council
on Drugs and Development so that NGOs in this field, North and
South, will be able to work more closely together and more effectively
also in their interaction with official bodies. Such an independent
citizens' body would carry out research, put forward policy options,
exchange expert information, promote educational activities and
work to support projects of our Southern partners. These operational
points should also be discussed at Lisbon.
<H3>Acknowledgements<BR>
</H3>

<P>
The organisers of the Lisbon conference wish to thank the distinguished
group of experts who graciously consented to prepare the background
papers for the Lisbon conference. They have done an extraordinary
job in succinctly putting forward an integrated analysis as well
as extremely valuable recommendations for policy and action options
for the future. Special thanks go to B&eacute;n&eacute;dicte de
Smet for commissioning, co-ordinating and editing the papers,
to the members of the European NGO Committee on Drugs and Development
for their own writing and advisory roles, and to our assistants
at EDRC for their editorial and production work. Finally, we would
also like to acknowledge the role of the members of the conference
preparatory committee, of the staff of the North-South Centre
and Mr Georges Estievenart, Director of the EMCDDA, for their
assistance in making this publication such a solid basis for discussion
at Lisbon. Let us hope that our deliberations will make a difference
which will be felt in the lives of the people of whom we speak.

<H3>The drug problem today<BR>
</H3>

<P>
It is a commonplace to say that drugs are one of the greatest
ills of the end of this century, one of the most complex and most
evil. It is a commonplace, but it is true; or it is a commonplace
because it is true. In comparison, our progress against the problem,
and education about the problem seems very slow, and at times
hesitant. But nothing could be worse than denial or indifference,
both also very great ills of the end of the century. But what
are we faced with on the world drug scene? We see a diversifying
and expanding output; organic products still show staying power,
but the devastating progress of synthetic products such as ecstasy
and amphetamines also faces us.
<P>
The previous ideas, simplistic, though convenient, have made the
issue unclear, ideas which opposed countries producing drugs and
those consuming them, with each country influencing the other
malevolently. Which producing country is today not a consumer,
and which consuming country is not increasingly becoming a producer?
And so, there is the South and the North, often badly affected,
without speaking of Eastern Europe, where drugs, prostitution,
weapons and nuclear trafficking, in an increasingly corrupt climate,
is becoming the powderkeg of tomorrow. For each cause there is
an effect; the fight against drugs itself is a double-edged sword;
in the South, politicians passionate in the fight against drugs
are elected with drug money, and in the North, accommodating politicians
claim to defend the moral and religious values passed down by
tradition. Face with this scourge of humanity, the answers are
organised little by little as the global understanding of the
phenomenon progresses. There too, black and white blend. The diversification
and the complementarity of efforts is developing. The war against
drugs, tried by the United States, having failed, has given way
to a more complete and integrated policy, where the repression
of drug trafficking, of the flow of drug money and of chemical
precursors still remains a high priority, increased even, in recent
years, but also where a more careful and organised attention is
being given to the fate of the drug addict himself, either on
the level of prevention or on the level of the limitation of the
consequences of the addict's addiction (harm reduction).
<P>
The most advanced policies today seem indeed to be those which
fuse in a coherent whole strong measures to repress the serious
crime associated with drug trafficking, with determined measures
within the socio-medical framework on drug addicts both at an
individual level (prevention, treatment, rehabilitation), and
at a collective level, in facing head-on the economic and social
conditions which exist in many weakened conurbations. This is
the orientation which in any case seems to be emerging little
by little in Europe, as was recently brought to light at the Brussels
Conference, held on 7 and 8 December 1995 devoted to the policies
in the fight against drugs in Europe, and which was confirmed
at the European summit in Madrid on 14 and 15 December 1995 when
it adopted by the report by the European Drug Expert Group.
<P>
At the same time, certainly, the ideological debates over the
legalisation versus prohibition of drugs which is taking place
all over the world in public opinion carry on, as well as the
bilateral controversy between States whose basic options, as we
know, often diverge, lending little to arriving at the working
solution which everyone awaits. In this context, the discipline
in reading, measuring and providing information on the global
drug phenomenon must be considerably reinforced. The recent creation
in Lisbon of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug
Addiction makes a decisive European contribution in that direction,
based on the principle that reliable information at the level
of the 15 Member States of the European Union is in itself a political
advancement. Indeed, information is not an accessory to policy
but an element of it, and with that in view, the EMCDDA must be
able to progressively identify the common elements of a European
approach to the problem, which naturally will fully take into
account the extent of globalisation of the drug phenomenon.
<P>
It seems to me that in the coming years the highest priority is
what I would call the &quot;reduction of contradictions&quot;
on the subject of drugs; the contradictions between North and
South, between national measures and international measures, between
the repression and reduction of demand, between the repression
of organised crime and petty crime, between demand reduction in
ebb (prevention) and the reduction of risks in flow, between State
entities dealing with the fight against drugs and the decentralised
individuals and non-governmental organisations. You will say that
this is an enormous programme, but an inevitable one, the only
alternative being resignation and defeat. There is no doubt in
this context that the Lisbon Conference, based around the &quot;Dependence
and Interdependence&quot; theme comes under the first category
and in this way contributes to the fight for the dignity and the
rights of man in the twenty first century. <HR>

<H3>''From ancestral routes to informal trade on the streets''
</H3>

<H3>&quot;A delinquent is someone who pursues goals that society
values by means that it does not&quot;. R.K.Merton</H3>

<H3>&quot;Couriers&quot; and consumers</H3>

<P>
The last three decades in western urban centres have been characterised
by two constants: the impoverishment of working-class suburbs,
hit by ever-increasing unemployment, and the influx of immigrants
of various origins, today accounting for a large proportion of
the urban population. Since the late 1980s, the homelands of these
scattered populations from central and eastern Europe, the Middle
East or the Maghreb countries have seen a worsening of their troubles
and, especially, a growing autonomy vis-&agrave;-vis the major
powers.
<P>
Having lost their source of funds when the Cold War ended, local
conflicts are now financed from the informal economy. But the
quest for profits, especially where drugs are concerned, has pushed
the warring parties to extend their control of trade from production
to retail sale. Conflicts as distant as those in Kurdistan, Abkhazia
and Algeria therefore have, in this respect, a direct influence
on the streets of Germany, the Netherlands or France.
<P>
All these (often unwitting) messengers of disorder find, at the
end of their journey, another equally dislocated society, that
of deprived urban areas. Paradoxically, these stricken populations
from afar seem closer to that society than the consumer society
alongside it. Drugs therefore enable these &quot;couriers&quot;
to achieve the myth of success and they help those living in deprived
areas to tolerate their exclusion.
<H3>The &quot;short circuits&quot; of the Schengen area</H3>

<P>
So, alongside traditional trafficking by established criminal
organisations, there is now a fragmented drugs economy: in Europe,
Kosovo clans, Chechens or Moroccans; &quot;Afghan&quot; fundamentalists
and Turkish &quot;grey wolves&quot;; Nigerian &quot;students&quot;
and Senegalese immigrant workers; Croatian, Serbian or Bosnian
&quot;fighters&quot;; and Latin-American, Polish or Russian &quot;businessmen&quot;
form networks of dealers outside the traditional distribution
circuits. The party, the brotherhood, family friends, old army
friends or colleagues from information services tell them what
they need to know : the size of the city, local dealers, potential
customers. In most cases, they own the drugs they are selling.
They buy them in Albania, Bulgaria, Turkey, Spain, Egypt or the
Ukraine, and sometimes directly from central Asia. They consider
the whole of Europe a potential market, a target which sometimes
becomes a bone of contention. The fact is that where drugs are
sold, where they bring in the necessary cash, the distribution
channels are fought over. So PKK militants and &quot;grey wolves&quot;,
Danhnak Armenians and Lebanese, Kosovo or Turkish networks are
constantly renegotiating distribution territories, sometimes going
as far as armed battle, as we saw recently in Zurich, Frankfurt
and Berlin. These are not straightforward gangland killings but
military operations conducted by trained troops, brought in specially
for the job, who, after fierce fighting, will dislodge a distribution
network from a whole neighbourhood.
<P>
Others, who are permanently on the move and act as &quot;raiders&quot;,
do not disturb local dealers. Unless they are unlucky (as was
the case in Savoie and in Brittany in 1995), by the time the locals
and the police react to their presence, they are long gone.
<P>
These &quot;short circuits&quot; can be found all over Europe.
In the Netherlands they go from restaurant to restaurant with
false-bottomed cans of orange juice. In France, they tour the
bars, while in Germany it is the caf&eacute;s and saunas. Trains,
stations, gaming rooms and hotel lobbies all become points of
sale. Or, there are those that stay put in high-class hotels,
for example in Salonika, and work by phone, waiting to be contacted;
sometimes they even apply for legal status. They prefer the provinces.
After deprived urban areas, provincial towns, and more particularly
those sleepy, out-of-season tourist resorts such as Deauville,
Verona and Karlovy-Vary (spa towns, ski resorts, seaside resorts
and so on) are beginning to make a name for themselves alongside
Tirana, Sofia and Istanbul.
<H3>Poor man's laundering</H3>

<P>
The symbiosis between immigrants and victims of social exclusion
democratises, to a certain extent, the profits from informal trade,
permeating the neighbouring environment. While the drugs trade
continues, as always, to make a few big shots very rich, it is
also part of a micro-economy resulting from the profits from street
dealing. The negative consequences, particularly among young people,
are well-known: loss of family authority, appeal of easy money,
life in a criminal environment, contempt for knowledge and education,
often leading to unemployment, etc. But on the streets, in the
crisis-stricken family, the immediate effects of the redistribution
of profits from drugs trafficking are not to be under-estimated:
small shops and services reap the benefits. The financial pressure
on families and even on local authorities is relieved. At the
same time, traffickers exert pressure to ensure that the neighbourhood
presents a facade of legality in order to ward off checks: rents
are paid, petty crime stamped out and so on.
<P>
In fact, this redistribution of profits is simply laundering on
a small-scale, corresponding to the situation of the very poor.
It merely reproduces, in miserabilist form, a mechanism which
in other spheres reintroduces far larger profits into the formal
economy.
<H3>Globalisation and micro-economy</H3>

<P>
At both worldwide and local level, drugs today, beyond their more
traditional characteristics, have become a means of escaping from
recession or achieving desirable goals. They are part of a more
global informal trade which is a response to the failures and
marginalisation of some members of our western societies, and
to the confusion of the world in general. The immigrants and the
victims of social exclusion are both hunters and hunted in this
process.
<P>
Just as the gap is widening between words and action within our
inner cities and suburbs, so the psychological constraint of an
all-out war against drugs is increasingly met with a stereotyped
response. Such fixed attitudes stand in the way of any genuine,
global talks on drugs, for as long as we remain increasingly attached
to our national borders and our certainties.
<P>
Before proposing alternative policies, it would be better therefore
to begin with these observations. As simple as they may be, they
do not seem for the moment to be clearly perceived.
<H3>The visible and the invisible</H3>

<P>
This situation focuses our action and reactions around visible
facts. Racism and xenophobia use drugs as a tool and find convenient
solutions by replacing the word xenos with drugs. Once again drugs
become a pretext, a justification for other phobias. Street dealers
and &quot;short circuit&quot; operators tend to be people with
&quot;ethnic&quot; origins, working in horizontal structures where
profits are, always invisibly, both made and spent, whereas the
drugs barons, wholesale dealers and launderers are usually westerners.
Their identity is rarely known, although they are occasionally
unmasked: the most recent example was in January 1996 when several
tons of hashish were seized in Galicia, Spain, and the organisers
and kingpins turned out to be Dutch and Spanish businessmen.
<P>
In fact, the very structure of drugs trafficking tends to be a
joint venture. Its visible parts, fragile and connected to street
dealing, are ingredients of an illegal environment of both users
and dealers. Its invisible parts, like modern businesses, blend
into a legal environment and the formal economy. According to
the World Customs Organisation, the bigger the haul, the fewer
the number of arrests made. While the number of arrests on the
streets among both users and dealers is on the increase, arrests
for international trafficking are stagnant.
<P>
Despite opposing principles, according to which either supply
or demand is regarded as the crucial factor, they must be examined
together as interacting elements.
<H3>Proposals</H3>

<P>
Beyond the universally-approved action to revitalise and rehabilitate
the economic, social and cultural life of deprived urban areas,
it is necessary to examine more closely the nature, extent and
impact of the informal economy on these areas, in the following
ways:
<P>
explain, in order to find solutions, why street dealing attracts
&quot;ethnic&quot; populations and networks;
<P>
break up the rings through which operators exchange drugs;
<P>
guard against certain perverse effects of administrative decisions
which affect user habits and directly influence trafficking; for
example, the introduction of methadone programmes in France caused
an increase in crack use.<HR>

<H3>&quot;The micro-economics of drugs in the marginalised regions
of the Amazon in Colombia</H3>

<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P>
Contrary to all expectations, coca leaf production has risen significantly
over the last three years in Caquet&aacute;, an Amazonian region
in southern Colombia which stretches over some 90,000 square kilometres
and is the focus of this paper.
<P>
By the end of 1995, between 40 and 45,000 hectares of coca had
been planted in the region (this is at odds with the naive figure
quoted by the Colombian Government of 38,000 hectares for the
whole country). This makes it one of Colombia's leading coca regions.
<P>
On the micro-economic front, this paper will attempt to reply
to the following question: Are there viable alternatives to coca?
Are government operations effective and, if not, what steps need
to be taken? The relationship between poverty, coca and damage
to the environment is clear.
<P>
The Amazon region's coca growers have, as a rule, been expelled
from richer areas as they did not own any land and thus find themselves
in absolute poverty. What is more, this trend is on the rise,
with the population of Caquet&aacute; climbing by 12% in 1994.
<P>
The region's natural environment is vulnerable and there is scarcely
any government presence, which, in turn, means no regional planning,
credible production alternatives or basic transport, supply and
market infrastructure.
<P>
Coca, on the other hand, has not only adapted miraculously to
the Amazon soil and climate, but would currently appear to be
the only viable crop. Profitability and a weekly cash-flow, albeit
fluctuating, are by far its most attractive features. What is
more, in spite of the major risks inherent in the coca economy
- for one thing it is illegal, and for another, everything is
controlled by &quot;guerrilleros&quot; groups and drug traffickers
- the crop offers unparalleled logistics in terms of financing,
technical assistance, production facilities and markets.
<P>
In January 1996, the total production cost (guerilla fees included)
of one kilo of coca base in Caquet&aacute; was US$ 393 and it
could be sold for US$ 1100, providing a return of 250%.
<P>
Of the US$ 1100 it fetches, 65% goes to the producer, 20% to the
labourer and 15% on production costs. That means that a family
of four with an average of four to five hectares of land can make
US$ 690 a month per person from coca, which is much better than
the barely tapped alternatives. Cocoa, for example, provides a
monthly income of US$ 90 and rubber US$ 225. Colombia's current
minimum wage lies somewhere in the region of US$ 142. Although
coca prices fluctuate more, the crop can easily be stored while
producers await better days.
<P>
Yet coca has a social cost and is synonymous with illegality,
total state neglect, crime, loss of civic responsibility, violence,
family breakdown, prostitution and alcoholism. It also has certain
indirect economic costs stemming from the inflationary trend triggered
by over-consumption of goods that are not produced locally, thereby
forcing the whole population to take up the coca trade, whether
to be able to keep up with wage levels or to respond to the increase
in wages in the countryside or to buy basic goods imported from
other regions.
<P>
Clearly the coca economy has brought no benefit to the region.
A telling example is provided by the people of Remolinos del Cagu&aacute;n,
which boasts the region's most dynamic coca trade, who are poorer
now than they were 20 years ago when the illegal trade did not
exist. There is minimal provision of education, health care and
services and no community and civil organisation. What is more,
people live in a climate of fear for the region's future.
<P>
Many peasants are willing to forego coca profits provided they
can rewrite the script of the tragedy which they are currently
experiencing.
<H3>Current policies and trends</H3>

<P>
Forced eradication (military persecution and fumigation) coupled
with substitution programmes (the PLANTE national alternative
development plan, the PNR rehabilitation plan and the INCORA Agrarian
Reform Institute) are the only policies the Colombian Government
has managed to come up with, under pressure from the US administration.
But everything has remained at the stage of well-meaning intentions
with no effective implementation and the only results have been
a temporary fall-off in the intensity of the coca trade and its
shift to the darkest depths of the forest. The peasants have learned
by themselves to predict the behaviour of coca prices and increase
or reduce their crops accordingly. In the meantime, they have
refined agronomic techniques for growing coca and have boosted
output figures.
<P>
The government has no regional planning blueprint to reverse the
ongoing trend of the local economy. The measures it did sketch
out were paternalistic, inconsistent, weak and out of step with
reality.
<P>
Other productive sectors in the region apart from coca, whether
extensive livestock rearing or logging (activities that are extremely
harmful to the environment), are becoming less and less attractive.
Unemployment is on the rise because of the scarcity of suitable
wood, the drop in demand for cattle both locally and internationally
and the fact that people are scared off from investing in the
region for fear of kidnapping or extortion and a general lack
of safety.
<P>
At regional level, there are neither development plans nor sources
of funding. The &quot;regional government&quot; simply does not
exist and the local political classes work only on the basis of
patronage. Local governments are very weak and have no steering
body that can plan ahead; they thus map out short-term strategies
with no effective sustained policy to achieve credible regional
development. This being the case, coca still remains the only
means of survival.
<P>
The main government programme for replacing and eradicating coca
is called PLANTE, but parts of it are strikingly paternalist and
populist. What is more, it is not at all clear and enjoys neither
local backing nor local participation. The programme, which is
to run over three years (1995-7), is based on vague figures, and
is targeted more at forced uprooting than substitution. It is
actually divided into two phases: the &quot;stick&quot; (fumigation
and armed intervention) and the &quot;carrot&quot; (loans, technical
assistance and the market). Loans do not work because the body
which is responsible for them (the Caja Agraria) is hampered by
the many formalities blocking access to credit. Technical assistance
comes under the municipal technical assistance units (Umatas),
which are totally ineffective and bereft of alternatives, given
that the Amazon regions do not have a credible production system
and that the professionals are not up to standard as they are
appointed on the basis of political quotas.
<P>
The market is still the main bottleneck for all peasant economies.
There is no infrastructure or transport network in the forest.
A region of 90,000 km2 has only some 800 kilometres of roads,
which are in a pitiful state and located only in a livestock-rearing
area. Under the PLANTE programme, the market is planned over two
years, which is far too short a time-frame to stabilise production
and write off the cost of the infrastructure needed for such a
project. At the end of the day, PLANTE is nothing more than a
policy to generate figures, be they accurate or not, for the United
States Government, which naively insists that thousands of hectares
of coca be destroyed without suggesting any alternative.
<H3>Practical alternative policies</H3>

<P>
Setting in motion a development process is the only way to eliminate
coca and avert an ecological tragedy. Without coca, peasants would
be forced to destroy vast swathes of forest to make room for traditional
crops and grow enough to earn as much as they did with coca. Attempting
to eradicate coca by armed force in a region where the guerilla
reigns supreme is a sign of acute naivety.
<P>
A logical and effective substitution plan calls above all for
long-term planning. In this scenario, the first and most urgent
thing to be done is to plug the gap in terms of production, processing
and marketing techniques. With no processing industry, the Amazon
regions will never manage to export their products. Technical
staff must therefore be trained to oversee the planning, transfer
and management of production systems at different levels of production,
processing and marketing. Clearly, substantial financial resources
are vital for implementing such programmes, which can, on no account,
be scheduled over the short-term but only over long periods. If
such a scheme were not feasible, legalisation would seem the most
appropriate alternative, yet even if coca were legalised, the
process outlined above could not be put off indefinitely.
<H3>Recommendations</H3>

<P>
People are increasingly coming to speak as one on the need for
any effective illegal crop eradication strategy to be &quot;mainstreamed&quot;,
that is to say to cover all aspects of people's lives in Amazon
regions.
<P>
<I>Priority should therefore go to:</I> 
<P>
programmes to encourage a return to civic and ethical values;
<P>
encouraging the growth of community organisations by fostering
an economy based on solidarity and a sense of belonging to the
country and the whole of its judicial, economical and political
system;
<P>
identifying and introducing Amazon products which can generate
a reasonable level of liquid assets and profitability. This would
involve basic research and technology transfer operations;
<P>
expanding national and international markets for legal products.
This would include upgrading technical facilities, road links,
storage capacities and transport;
<P>
working towards the industrialisation and processing of Amazon
products, without which the enthusiasm of farmers for new crops
would be dampened;
<P>
providing social infrastructure (schools, bridges, hospitals,
water etc). Such amenities may help integrate people into civil
society and limit peasants' resistance to substitutes for coca
by making up for income lost from new alternative crops.
<P>
At international level, the technology required means that foreign
backing and investment as well as sufficient human resources are
needed to work out forms of production tailored to the Amazon
region, along with assistance from and training for national and
local professionals, who might take charge of arranging, establishing,
adapting and transferring such systems.
<P>
At national level, what is urgently needed is an integrated regional
development blueprint consonant with the socio-cultural and agro-ecological
features of the area.
<P>
At regional level, it is crucial to set up and strengthen government
and non-governmental bodies which are capable of bringing production
systems into line with the situation on the ground.
<P>
What are needed locally are integrated training schemes for the
transfer of technologies to suit the community.
<H3>Conclusion</H3>

<P>
Failing this, the likely scenario for the whole of the Amazon
region is another 20 to 25 years of the grim and tragic existence
that goes hand in hand with coca growing, with all its grave implications
for the region, the country and the world.

<H3>Illegal accumulation and world economy</H3>

<P>
In the recent past, the international drug market has further
spread and has become more complex. New consumption markets have
formed in the Third World and in the former socialist countries,
new criminal groups were born and the number of psychoactive substances
has grown. Drug trafficking is one of the most important fields
of transnational crime, because the activities of this traffic
(production, trade, laundering of illegal capital) have a world-wide
scale.
<P>
Even if the estimates are uncertain and contradictory, it is certain
that the illegal accumulation, derived not only from drugs but
from many activities (arms, nuclear materials, toxic waste, counterfeit
products, control of illegal immigration, &quot;organ commerce&quot;,
etc.) is comparable to that of big multinationals. According to
data from research institutes and the UN, the annual proceeds
of drug trafficking would be between 300 and 500 billion dollars
(but UNDCP indicates values between 500 and 1000 billion) and
the annual turnover of the large criminal organisations would
be 750 billion dollars.
<P>
The laundering of illegal money is promoted by the computerisation
of the financial channels and by the peculiarities of the international
economy. Last March, the DDA (Direzione Distrettuale Antimafia)
of Catania arrested a man above suspicion, making a banking transaction
of 1 billion dollars. The liberalisation of the circulation of
capitals, the creation of large regional markets (UE, NAFTA, APEC)
and the world-wide financial economy increase the possibility
of symbiosis of dirty and clean money. Every day in the world
financial market, there are transactions amounting to about 1.000
billion dollars, but the real exchanges are only a small part.
The majority is wandering capital going in search of more remunerative
income and an undeterminable share is formed by illegal capital.
<P>
In the opinion of the international organisations (e.g. the UN
World Conference on Organised Transnational Crime in Naples, 21-23
November 1994), the main cause of transnational crime is the anomalous
development of capitalism in new areas, notably different from
the &quot;classical&quot; countries (Western countries, USA, Japan).
In many countries, for instance in the former socialist countries,
there is a sort of &quot;jungle&quot;, i.e. a market without State
and without law. This analysis overlooks the fact that organised
crime started first in Western countries, both in peripheral-semiperipheral
areas, for instance Sicily and Southern Italy, and in central
areas, for instance USA. In this context, the new capitalist countries
follow the example of the Western countries.
<P>
My working hypothesis is that transnational crime is not pathological-anomalous
but a structural aspect of capitalist economy in its current phase,
definable as &quot;capitalism without alternatives&quot;. The
capitalistic globalisation and the international organisations'
policies (structural adjustments, dismantling of economic branches,
privatisation of public properties, unemployment, exchange liberalisation)
increase territorial disequilibria and social gaps and offer considerable
advantages to the illegal capital.
<P>
Therefore, we can say that, in marginal areas (the Souths of the
world, even the Souths in the Norths), illegal accumulation is
the &quot;criminal way to capitalism&quot; and in the central
areas (the Norths), it is the &quot;criminal way of capitalism&quot;.
<H3>Official policies</H3>

<P>
On 8 November 1990, the Council of Europe approved the Strasbourg
Convention on laundering, research, sequestration and confiscation
of criminal proceeds, signed by about 20 States. The European
Community studied the problem of organised crime through a board
of inquiry in 1991 and, in June of the same year, approved directive
n.328 on laundering the proceeds of illicit activities. Only a
few countries (Bulgaria, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom,
Switzerland, Italy, i.e. only three of the members of the EU)
ratified the Strasbourg Convention and, among the States that
have accepted the directive, some (France, Spain, Portugal) limited
the application to the proceeds of narcotraffic. Only Italy, Germany,
Belgium, Ireland, The Netherlands and the United Kingdom consider
as crime the laundering of the proceeds of all criminal activities.
The United Kingdom has excluded Jersey and Guernsey, the British
Isles best known as tax havens.
<P>
The international conference on prevention and control of laundering
dirty money and use of the proceeds of crime (Courmayeur 18-20
June 1994) showed the general lines of anti-crime world policy
resuming the Vienna Convention, the Basel Declaration and the
recommendations of FATF.
<P>
The Conference identified some priorities: introduction of the
crime &quot;laundering proceeds of drug traffic&quot; in the legal
system of the States subscribers of the Vienna Convention; restrictions
of banking secrecy; application of the rule of the Basel Declaration
&quot;Know your client&quot; and of FATF recommendations, especially
the abolition of the anonymous accounts and the identification
of the &quot;front men&quot;; the notification of suspicious transactions;
the control of the financial companies and professional offices
that offer financial services; the confiscation of proceeds of
illicit activities.
<P>
The UN Conference (Naples 21-23 November 1994) proposed the internationalisation
of the Italian crime &quot;associazione a delinquere di tipo mafioso&quot;.
However, the participants didn't come to an agreement on the abolition
of banking secrecy and on the laundry of dirty money. The opposers
were, above all, the small States that acted as tax havens, near
the United States and Europe.
<P>
It is impossible to treat problems so complex with precarious
committees and episodic recommendations, mostly doomed to remain
on paper, or with meetings whose utility is inversely proportional
to their cost. It is necessary to establish permanent organisations,
for instance a European monitoring centre on organised crime and
the laundering of dirty money; to bring into operation Europol,
until today paralysed by the divergences of the Member States;
to institute the formation of a European and international criminal
law.
<H3>Alternative Policies</H3>

<P>
An alternative policy must place the accent on prevention, acting
on the causes and on the forming process of illegal accumulation.
For this claim, it is necessary:
<P>
1) to change the economic policies of the frame the abolition
of prohibition, which acts as an incentive for criminal groups
to share out the drug business and criminalises the consumers.international
organisations. We must change from the present phase, which we
can name the &quot;dictatorship of profit and transnational corporations&quot;
to a new phase of &quot;economic democracy&quot;, based on local
development. Obviously, an economic democracy is impossible without
political democracy. All this is valid both for the UN and for
the EU. We must work to change from the superpower of some States
to the peoples' and citizens' community;
<P>
2) to develop the legal economy in the more marginalised countries,
starting from the local resources: raw materials, cultural goods,
human abilities;
<P>
3) to redefine and strengthen international cooperation, as collaboration
among equals and not as an imposition from the outside of foreign
and distorted patterns;
<P>
4) we must put inside this
<P>
Regarding the laundry of dirty money, it is necessary to stop
or at least to control the liberalisation of capital circulation,
reduce the circulation of speculative capital (tax forms, stock
exchange regulation, etc), abolish any form of obscurity of the
financial system: banking secrecy, tax havens, financial innovations,
etc.
<P>
It is evident that these policies are in counter-trend regarding
the present policies. If we do not want to cultivate a pious hope,
we must state a problem: with what forces, what means, what modalities
can we carry out such an ambitious alternative plan?
<P>
To set off on this way, we must strengthen the grass-roots organisations
(NGOs, citizens' associations) and help to create local, national
and international organisations based on real participation.
<H3>Proposals</H3>

<P>
1. To create a permanent network of NGOs and citizens' associations,
a grass-roots EU, open to other countries and continents, which
concentrate on the problems of alternative development, identifying
financial resources, collaborating in projects, forming the necessary
skills. This network must be at European, national and local levels.
We can name them: Alternative Development Laboratories.
<P>
2. To found alternative financial channels (for instance, the
Green Banks in Germany, the Italian Banca Etica and MAG: Mutua
Auto Gestione) for development projects in marginalised areas.
<P>
3. To bring into operation the network among the documentation
centres of European NGO Council on Drugs, and
<P>
4. to found, within this framework, a European monitoring centre
on the illegal accumulation and laundering dirty money. The tasks
of this centre could be the following:
<UL>
<LI>examining critically the laws in force and the international
conventions;
<LI>putting forward proposals to reform rules and conventions;
<LI>collecting documents: judicial and investigative acts, press
reviews (newspapers and magazines skilled on financial problems),
other sources;
<LI>publishing a bulletin;
<LI>organising information and education campaigns;
<LI>elaborating a project for the use of confiscated properties
to finance development projects and even the centre.

<H3>&quot;Drug capital in a neo-liberal world&quot;</H3>

<P>
Ten years after Ronald Reagan signed an executive order declaring
&quot;war on drugs&quot; the figures speak for themselves: far
from shrinking, the consumer market worldwide has expanded; it
has levelled off in the United States and Europe but new &quot;national
markets&quot; have been won in the cities of South America and
Africa. Drugs supply has been diversified with new synthetic drugs
coming onto the market, and a trend towards a more sophisticated,
in other words more destructive and deadly, consumption.
<P>
The area given over to poppy growing in Colombia has grown considerably
in only three years and cocaine production in Peru, Ecuador and
Bolivia has remained steady, despite the policy of destroying
crops and replacing coca plantations.
<P>
Major drug seizures have fallen in absolute terms while, simultaneously,
new drug trade routes have appeared and the number of outlets,
especially on the Atlantic side of South America, has increased.
<P>
The dismantling of the Medellin cartel and the supposed neutralisation
of the Cali cartel have not had any marked effect on Colombian
exports of drugs; quite the contrary, the huge increase in heroin
production confirms that producers are competing for European
markets, traditionally supplied from south-east Asia. Similarly,
there is an attempt to promote diversification of consumption
in the United States. In addition, other mafias, especially in
Bolivia, Brazil and Mexico, have enjoyed a meteoric rise.
<P>
Political and administrative corruption have led to new and even
juicier scandals, but this problem has kept on growing worldwide
and is now directly linked to illicit capital flows, especially
of drug capital.
<P>
The combination of these factors has stimulated, as in any self-respecting
free market, a trend towards higher prices, defying the very laws
of that free market since supplies have grown and there are rarely
any temporary shortages.
<P>
The general evolution of the drugs market reveals the ineffectiveness
of the current policies intended to &quot;eliminate the problem&quot;.
One possible explanation for this failure is that, whereas repressive
measures are concentrated in the areas of production or distribution
(increasingly involving massive participation by the military),
the financial aspect, ie the mobilisation of capital, its legalisation
and the use of profits, is somewhat lax. This discrepancy is baffling
to say the least, since it is now widely accepted that capital
is the driving force of the drugs trade and that its high rate
of return explains its vitality.
<P>
Drugs always have been, and still are, an excellent trade product,
booming despite the apocalyptic tone of official rhetoric, calling
into question the effectiveness of repressive strategies. Together
with smuggling and the arms trade, with which it has many connections,
it is one of the most profitable forms of trade. Drugs trafficking
is a decisive factor in maintaining certain driving forces of
some regional economies, cycles which tend to consolidate so-called
&quot;marginal economies&quot;. Capital from the drugs trade supports
a social structure where the state is conspicuous by its absence,
as is the case in the forests of eastern Peru, in the Chapare
(Bolivia), in some Amazonian regions of Brazil and central-eastern
Colombia. In these rural regions (as well as some inner-city neighbourhoods),
drug money is the cornerstone of consumption, funding production
and trading activities.
<P>
Laundering drug capital is the main medium of this trade, the
keystone to the whole structure, a factor even more vital than
the availability of production resources or other prerequisites
for the production process.
<P>
Both these factors - the industrial factor of production resources
and the financial factor of profit and investment - are directly
related to the will (or lack of will) demonstrated in world centres,
wherever they are, to give priority to tackling drugs trafficking
and drugs consumption.
<P>
The steady growth of large-scale drug-capital laundering and the
remarkable inability of developed countries to prevent, repress
and eliminate the laundering of drug money, points to contradictions
in attitudes whereby determination fails, impetus is undermined
and good intentions undone whenever attempts are made to intervene
in that murky and deliberately complex universe called the world
financial system. If it were possible to describe those paralysing
contradictions, even only sketchily, it might be possible to offer
an explanation for the failures of policies designed to combat
the problem of drugs trafficking and consumption.
<P>
As long as there is no orchestration of effective action plans
to put a stranglehold on financial movements of drug capital,
it will be difficult to stamp out the other manifestations of
the phenomenon. This, at least, is what can be deduced from ten
years of declared war on drugs trafficking.
<P>
This aspect of the problem which offers a decisive role to financial
operations must first be dealt with thoroughly, even if it seems
obvious: those responsible for financial transactions linked to
drug trafficking are not the same people who oversee production
and organise the traffic. The former work in the business world
and enjoy the prestige resulting from their legal activities,
an increasingly elastic and &quot;pragmatic&quot; legality.
<P>
Laundering capital takes advantage of a certain impunity given
that the borderline between legality and illegality is vague in
the world of finance, a world which worships a new religion whose
first commandment is success. Arms manufacturers never give a
thought to the consequences of their use and rarely bother to
find out how certain arms end up in the hands of people who should
never have received them. The same goes for chemical agents and,
in particular, money: the universally accepted norm is an attempt
to turn secrecy into a sacred value as far as the identity of
the investor, capitalist or holder of a bank account is concerned.
Since no norm is a norm unless it is widespread or universalised,
the risk of illegal manipulation is accepted and considered an
exceptional consequence.
<P>
But in practice, it is by no means an exceptional consequence:
experts think that larger and larger proportions of worldwide
financial activity are accounted for by the movement of proceeds
from illegal activities. Certain codes distinguish between &quot;grey
capital&quot; and &quot;black capital&quot;, in order to differentiate
between money produced by tax evasion, fraud linked to over-invoicing
or under-invoicing of merchandise, on the one hand, and kickbacks
in government spheres, the capital raised from smuggling merchandise
and arms, drug trafficking and the white slave trade.
<P>
The very existence of this distinction encourages the gradual
abandonment of scruples: certain money laundering operations are
not seen as criminal and are not condemned by society; they are
seen as a tolerable means of increasing profits, i.e. a way of
achieving more success.
<P>
The explicit discrimination practised by American anti-drug agencies
is not unrelated to this situation: they focus their effort and
pressure on governments to tighten up their legislation against
drug dollars but rule out any initiative aimed at stamping out
any other kind of money laundering. The bilateral agreements signed
over the last two years between the United States and Latin American
governments, in order to bring about practical judicial co-operation,
clearly limit initiatives to crimes related to drug money laundering.
<P>
Incidentally, this attitude - accepted by most Latin American
governments - has led to embarrassing situations. For example,
in the recently-created Mercosur organisation (the Common Market
of the South), the process of economic integration suffers from
periodic problems because Uruguayan legislation on the free circulation
of capital facilitates tax evasion in Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay.
The consequences are not only regional: the advantages of the
Uruguayan tax haven made possible the biggest-ever tax evasion
operation in Belgium's history.
<P>
A number of recent episodes in Latin America point to flaws in
the South American approach: tax evasion, trade racketeering and
drug dollars often form capital laundering circuits and deliberately
use multiple transfers, bank deposits and financial investment
to cover up the origin of the money and so make it &quot;clean&quot;.
<P>
Certain triangular financial operations between Argentina, Uruguay
and Bosnia have made possible arms sales and, at the same time,
the laundering of capital identified as coming from drugs traffic.
Money laundering has become a cornerstone of financial movements
in Latin America whereas official statistics reveal a steady fall
in investment and production.
<P>
Speculation flows of &quot;hot money&quot; have led to competition
for attracting it, so that there is now a trend towards the progressive
liberalisation of capital movements, the gradual removal of all
control mechanisms and the strengthening of secrecy, be it banking,
administrative or registration secrecy. Since this &quot;hot money&quot;
disappears as quickly as it appears, Latin American financial
markets maximalise this play of facilities. Since money laundering
goes hand in hand with certain kinds of political and administrative
corruption there has been an increase in the mechanisms for protecting
information to counter demands for greater transparency.
<P>
The need to preserve institutional stability has led to a trend
towards greater secrecy. Banking secrecy is now seen as necessary
for the stability of the financial system, but it can also be
used to ward off crises in the political system rocked by corruption
scandals. The message being sent by governments is clear: the
facilities given to capital transfers are in step with the economic
trend towards total deregulation.
<P>
Although this strategy has not borne the fruit expected of it
and macro-economic indicators are disappointing, the policies
pursued have amplified this trend so that in Latin America, at
least, speculative activity has dominated the financial sector.
<P>
Inevitably, capital laundering has increased to a point where
capital of illicit origin is used to finance certain essential
aspects of current economic policies. In certain countries it
has been claimed that capital raised from the drug trade has been
used to support the privatisation of public undertakings; in other
cases, the steady flow of this capital has made it possible to
implement monetary policies designed to reduce inflation; in yet
other cases, it has been used to end the in-fighting between different
sectors of authority or used to fund fraudulent operations for
implementing politico-military strategies at regional level.
<P>
In this way, the proceeds from drug trafficking have been used
to finance economic policies designed to promote the full liberalisation
of markets as well as a deregulation of the commercial and financial
sectors. Behind these strategies we can detect the hand of multilateral
lending bodies or the guidance of American specialist agencies,
which in turn highlights a new paradox: while certain American
agencies are putting pressure on governments to limit banking
secrecy vis-&agrave;-vis drug trafficking offences, others oppose
any change designed to slow down any opening of the market or
liberalisation.
<P>
This has been the case, for example, of certain international
loans which have been subjected to a restructuring of central
banks towards deregulation of the financial system.
<P>
In Latin America, at least, those involved in drug trafficking
are fervent defenders of so-called neo-liberal policies because
they undoubtedly are in their interests. Of course, it is not
our intention to establish a cause-and-effect relationship between
neo-liberalism and drug trafficking, but it cannot be ignored
that these neo-liberal policies have resulted in record levels
of corruption.
<P>
The strategy to weaken the state and encourage the privatisation
of public companies has fostered kickbacks: witness the organised
systems of pay-offs for authorising certain transactions between
state bodies and private companies. This corruption boom has boosted
the influence wielded by the drug cartels' money-men.
<P>
Inevitably, drug trafficking capital seems to be linked to the
major financial scandals and, as is the case in Colombia or Mexico,
they even seem to be involved in manipulation for the purpose
of forming governments or influencing the outcome of electoral
campaigns.
<P>
Consequently, it could be said that drug capital takes the front
seat in economic processes, leading to yet another paradox inherent
in the worldwide drug problem: maintaining neo-liberal strategies,
supporting the principle of deregulation and extreme liberalisation
tends to strengthen the role of drugs traffic two-fold. It props
up the marginal aspects of official markets as well as providing
a source of financial resources in long periods of recession.
Some analysts believe that drug dollars are also used, occasionally
to honour external debt repayments.
<P>
Certain Latin America specialists and analysts claim that the
role played by illegal capital in national and regional economic
processes has reached a point where to do without it would probably
trigger total collapse. Others try to play down this role, qualifying
it as influential but not decisive. Whatever the conclusion, there
does not appear to be a genuine desire in official circles to
stamp out the problem, whether in international decision-making
centres or national governments.
<P>
To do something effective, a determined action plan is needed
in order to lift certain legal smokescreens designed to increase
all kinds of secrecy, the basis of financial activities linked
to drugs trafficking.
<P>
The abolition of banking secrecy and the installation of controls
on capital movements would be the main planks of any strategy
designed to stifle the drug traffickers' financial activities.
But this would entail co-ordination at various levels between
governments and major private financial institutions, on the basis
of solid and sincere agreements.
<P>
Otherwise these habits will continue in Latin America, especially
in tax havens: governments will introduce control rules but they
will not be applied. Following their example, private institutions
will tend to relax their own preventive controls instead of tightening
them. Is it possible to implement such sincere and solid agreements?
In theory, yes, although for that purpose it will be necessary
to eliminate political obstacles associated with current economic
models. The challenge is all the greater because these obstacles
are highly structured, and based on economic and political correlation
and dependence.
<P>
Any other solution, such as the definition of new economic crimes,
together with sanctions (many countries do not consider money
laundering a crime) may prove partial and inadequate and, even
worse, may be scorned by the drug traffickers. They have already
demonstrated &quot;genius&quot;, audacity and shamelessness in
dodging armies, deriding controls, violating borders and corrupting

<H3>''Global Debt and the Criminalisation of Economic Activity''
</H3>

<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P>
Global debt has favoured the rapid growth of illicit trade and
the criminalisation of economic activity on a world scale. Globalisation
is marked by a parallel process of &quot;internationalisation
of the criminal economy&quot;. The national mafias increasingly
operate as transnational business entities within the global marketplace.
There is ample evidence of expanded levels of &quot;business transactions&quot;
and exchange between the various criminal organisations. Moreover,
a significant part of this criminal economy is fully integrated
into the workings of international banking and finance.
<P>
There are several, and often contradictory, estimates pertaining
to the size of the criminal economy. A recent estimate of the
United Nations suggests that total worldwide revenues of transnational
criminal organisations (TCOs) are of the order of one trillion
dollars representing an amount equivalent to the combined GDP
of the group of low income countries (with a combined population
of 3 billion people). The United Nations estimate includes the
trade in narcotics, arms sales, etc. as well as the earnings derived
from the mafia controlled services economy (eg. prostitution,
hotels, gambling, exchange banks, etc.). What these estimates
do not adequately convey is the magnitude of routine investments
by the criminal mafias in &quot;legal&quot; business ventures.
<H3>The Role of Economic Restructuring</H3>

<P>
The evidence confirms that the macro-economic reforms imposed
by external creditors on developing countries have been conducive
to a weakening of both the export sector and the internal market.
In turn, the crisis affecting the <I>&quot;legal economy&quot;</I>
has created an environment which favours the rapid development
of illicit production and trade.  In other words, the vacuum created
in the legal economy and the consequent collapse in the standard
of living tends to encourage, in many developing countries, the
concurrent development of an <I>&quot;alternative economy&quot;</I>
based on the narcotics trade and a growing number of illicit activities.
In many countries in the Third World and in the former Eastern
bloc, export and domestic markets collapse simultaneously creating
a situation where illicit production becomes the dominant &quot;leading&quot;
sector as well as the main source of foreign exchange.
<H3>The Reforms in International Banking</H3>

<P>
This restructuring of the real economy (at national and world
levels) is also accompanied by profound changes in the global
monetary system. National and global patterns of economic growth
are conditioned by the internationalisation of macro-economic
reform. The latter are not only conducive to the restructuring
of the real economy, they also favour the removal of barriers
to the movement of money within the international banking system.
<P>
The reforms of international currency markets (including the development
of electronic transfers and the deregulation of foreign exchange
markets) tend to facilitate the circulation and recycling of &quot;dirty
money&quot; in the international banking system. Major international
commercial banks not only constitute an outlet for money laundering,
they also provide credit to the agents of illegal trade (often
to the detriment of legal agriculture and manufacturing).
<P>
Offshore banking and the global laundering of dirty money have
become inherent features of the international banking system.
At the global economic level, the evidence suggests that legal
and illegal business activities are increasingly interlocked.
 Illicit trade permeates the fabric of normal financial and business
operations as well as the organs of State power. The evidence
would suggest that the economic mafias also exercise control over
major banking interests.
<P>
Conversely, legal business activities invest in the criminal economy
through the acquisition of banks, commercial companies, etc. which
are involved in the laundering of dirty money and/or have business
linkages to criminal organisations. The process operates in both
directions: criminal organisations (eg. with interests in the
narco-economy) acquire banking and productive assets in the legal
economy; conversely legal economic and financial interests have
a financial stake in the illicit economy.
<P>
The foregoing process also affects the structure of the national
State: prominent political figures and senior officials in national
governments have ties of allegiance to criminal organisations.
There is, in this context, a consequent &quot;distortion&quot;
in political structures and social relations which has a direct
bearing on policy formulation by national governments, including
the articulation of macro-economic and financial reforms. Criminal
organisations involved in illicit trade increasingly constitute
a powerful undercover lobby operating both at the national and
international levels influencing the scope and direction of government
policy.
<H3>Offshore Banking</H3>

<P>
Offshore banking shields corporations from taxation and provides
a safe-haven for the laundering of dirty money 1. The banking
havens are not limited to the many tropical island republics,
offshore facilities are now firmly established within the boundaries
of the European Union: Luxembourg, the Channel Islands, Dublin,
Madeira and Gibraltar. The offshore havens are an appendage of
the Western Banking system.  With deregulation, they have become
an integral part of the workings of the global financial marketplace
2. The magnitude of offshore banking is overwhelming. The Cayman
Islands constitutes the fifth largest banking centre in the world
with more banks and registered trust companies than the number
of its inhabitants 3.
<P>
Vast amounts of <I>&quot;black money&quot;</I> (namely money which
has escaped taxation) can be moved rapidly through electronic
transfer from one offshore safe haven to the next.  Corporations
can also use the banking havens to <I>&quot;recycle their profits&quot;</I>
towards a variety of business activities including speculative
investments and <I>&quot;hot money deposits&quot;</I> in the &quot;emerging
financial markets&quot; of south-east Asia and Eastern Europe.
 Large amounts of dirty and black money are channelled towards
the purchase of State assets in the so-called &quot;countries
in transition&quot;. The purchase of large amounts of government
debt in the form of bonds and securities is also transacted directly
from the island havens. The island safe havens have also been
extensively used by criminal organisations to launder <I>&quot;dirty
money&quot;</I> including the proceeds of the drug trade. <I>&quot;Dirty
money&quot;</I> - which routinely transits through the island
havens - is in turn converted into <I>&quot;clean money&quot;</I>
enabling the criminal mafias to acquire control over banking and
productive assets in the &quot;legal economy&quot;. Conversely,
the billions of dollars of <I>&quot;dirty money&quot;</I> deposited
in bank accounts (by these criminal organisations) enable the
&quot;legal&quot; banking system to considerably expand its lending
activities including the purchase of government bonds, which signifies
that the public debt is also financed by the proceeds of illegal
trade...
<P>
Moreover, with electronic transfers, the nature of money has changed.
Money becomes an intangible which moves at high speed within the
system. The rapid circulation and internationalisation of money
movements is an essential feature of the evolving World monetary
system. These innovations in banking also contribute to enlarging
the activities of money laundering. The convenience and speed
at which dirty money transactions can be undertaken tend to facilitate
the development of illicit trade and the narcotics economy.
<H3>The Role of Macro-Economic Reform</H3>

<P>
The restructuring of the real economy is paramount to an understanding
of the growth of illicit trade. Since the early 1980s, the <I>&quot;macro-economic
stabilisation&quot;</I> and <I>&quot;structural adjustment&quot;</I>
programmes imposed by the IMF and the World Bank on developing
countries (as a condition for the renegotiation of their external
debt) have led to the impoverishment of hundreds of millions of
people. Contrary to the spirit of the Bretton Woods agreement
which was predicated on &quot;economic reconstruction&quot; and
stability of major exchange rates, the structural adjustment programme
has largely contributed to destabilising national currencies and
ruining the economies of developing countries.  Internal purchasing
power has collapsed, famines have erupted, health clinics and
schools have been closed down, etc. These conditions have in turn
favoured the development of illicit trade and the criminalisation
of economic activity.
<P>
In the case of Peru and Bolivia, for instance, the IMF sponsored
reforms have contributed to undermining the role of legal commodity
exports while providing a boost to the narcotics economy. In Bolivia,
the 1985 IMF-sponsored macro-economic stabilisation programme
was conducive to the collapse of mineral exports and the restructuring
of the mining economy. The reorganisation of the state mining
consortium COMIBOL had a direct impact on the development of the
illegal coca economy: severance payments to redundant miners were
invested in the acquisition of land in the coca producing areas
by workers who had been laid off to the extent that both capital
and labour were redirected towards the coca economy.
<P>
In Peru, the development of the narco-economy under President
Alberto Fujimori also bears an intimate relationship to the conduct
of macro-economic policy: the August 1990 economic shock created
the conditions for the further growth of the drug trade.  First,
the contraction of internal demand coupled with the lifting of
tariffs on imported food staples, contributed to a serious recession
in agricultural production.
<H3>Macro-economic Reform and Illicit Trade in the Eastern Block
Countries</H3>

<P>
Since the late 1980s, the IMF-World Bank &quot;economic medicine&quot;
has been imposed on Eastern Europe, Yugoslavia and the former
Soviet Union with devastating economic and social consequences.
Also of significance is the extent to which the economic measures
in the former Soviet Union contribute to destroying civil society
and distorting fundamental social relations: the criminalisation
of economic activity, the looting of State property, money laundering
and capital flight are bolstered by the reforms. Dirty and black
money from offshore havens are recycled towards the acquisition
of State assets in the former Soviet Union. Luxembourg and the
British Virgin Islands are respectively ranked third and fourth
among &quot;foreign investors&quot; in the Russian Federation...
4
<P>
In other words, the privatisation programme (through the public
auction of State enterprises) favours the transfer of a significant
portion of State property to organised crime. The latter permeates
the State apparatus and constitutes a powerful lobby broadly supportive
of Yeltsin's economic reforms. According to a recent estimate,
half of Russia's commercial banks are under the control of the
local mafias, and half of the commercial real estate in central
Moscow is in the hands of organised crime. 5
<H3>The Real Economy: The Shift from Legal to Illicit Production
</H3>

<P>
While the legal commodity economy declines as a result of the
macro-economic reforms, illegal commodity exports are expected
to play an expanded role in generating the revenues required to
service the external debt. The creditors do not distinguish between
clean and dirty money. The recycling of dirty money towards debt
servicing is a necessary consequence of the weakening of the legal
economy and the incapacity of developing countries to service
their debt from shrinking export revenues.  Various institutional
mechanisms which favour the recycling of dirty and black money
towards debt servicing have been established by national governments.
The repatriation of capital flight to meet debt servicing obligations
is encouraged by the Bretton Wood institutions.
<P>
The application of the IMF economic reforms tends to further depress
world commodity prices because they force individual countries
to simultaneously gear their national economies towards a shrinking
world market thereby creating a situation of oversupply on world
markets. In turn, the dollarisation of input prices, the reforms
in the structures of credit to agriculture and manufacturing further
exacerbates the decline in the real economy.
<P>
World prices collapse for legal primary commodity exports in a
global economy characterised by surplus output. In turn, &quot;alternative&quot;
exports unfold within the spheres of the illicit economy. With
legal commodity prices plummeting, illicit trade and the narco-economy
often become the main source of the country's foreign exchange.
<H3>The Collapse of the Internal Market</H3>

<P>
The collapse of the legal domestic manufacturing and agriculture
(for the internal market) including the informal sector is engineered
through the liberalisation of trade and the lifting of tariff
barriers. Trade liberalisation destabilises internal markets and
undermines domestic production geared towards the internal market.
The dumping of food surpluses in Sub-Saharan Africa, for instance,
has contributed to the demise of food farming and livestock production
for the local market. The latter are replaced by imports from
the European Community and North America. The development of illegal
production results from the displacement of food agriculture.
<P>
Two processes are taking place concurrently: exports collapse
and the internal production for the domestic market is replaced
by imports. In the extreme case, the restructuring process leads
to the collapse of the entire legal economy. Legal exports are
replaced by illicit trade and imported consumer goods replace
goods produced by domestic producers. Namely, the national economy
is reduced to illicit production, in turn, the latter becomes
the main source of foreign exchange which funds debt servicing
and imports. In many developing countries, illicit production
has become the dominant activity overshadowing the legal economy
and replacing legal exports.

especially in substitution and alternative development''</H3>

<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P>
Illicit drugs production has become an increasingly important
development option in many developing countries. The demand for
drugs has enabled the establishment of an illicit sector; one
which is always searching for and finding places and mechanisms
which guarantee a maximum of benefits against a minimum of risks.
Structural poverty in producing countries is at the root of the
problem. The illegal sector is capable of doing what established
society is less and less capable of doing, that is it can offer
a perspective to those who do not have any, in this case, the
small peasant community. The extension of drug-linked cultivation
together with the growth of the sector involved in the manufacturing
and commercialisation of these drugs in developing countries is
directly linked to the severe socio-economic crisis that affects
these countries. The lack of development opportunities in traditional
rural areas and the destruction of the productive apparatus have
resulted in the migration of population towards the cities or
rural regions where development poles can be found which require
labour. In drug producing countries, these development poles are
based on the cultivation of plants used in the production of drugs.

<P>
Nevertheless, it would be a mistake to suggest that the price
received by a grower of opium in Burma, cannabis in Morocco, or
coca in Peru enables him to live well. In fact, these crops are
often the only profitable ones as the prices received for other
cash crops do not cover the production costs. 
<P>
It is therefore not surprising that the repressive strategy against
the cultivation of these plants, which is financed and implemented
under pressure mainly from the United States, has failed. It has
resulted in the so-called &quot;balloon effect&quot;, that is
the irrational extension of illicit cultivation towards areas
that are even more difficult to control. This, in turn, has brought
about counter-effective and undesirable effects such as the corruption
of institutions in charge of repression, the appearance of armed
movements that benefit from the social conflicts in order to obtain
control over the producing areas and the environmental damage
produced by the methods to eradicate illicit cultivation.
<P>
In comparison, the strategy of alternative development is a much
more positive answer to the problem. This strategy implies providing
concrete measures which favour alternative development options
to those related to drugs. This strategy can be applied both in
producing areas, and in areas where migration takes place. It
consists both of the creation of production lines and the establishment
of the necessary technical and social infrastructure to increase
the living standards of the local population.
<P>
Unfortunately, the results of the alternative development strategy
have, in most cases, been disappointing. More than once, it has
had counter-productive results, leading to an increase in drug-linked
cultivation. Even in the areas where projects have been successful
in reducing drug-linked cultivation, there is no evidence that
they have had any impact on the phenomenon of drugs trafficking
in general.
<P>
There are various reasons for this, both external and internal
in character. What is needed is a profound analysis of these reasons
leading to a series of necessary measures aimed at improving the
impact of alternative development strategy.
<H3>Current policies</H3>

<P>
The alternative development strategy is implemented through programmes
and concrete projects that are financed mainly by the developed
countries in the form of bilateral, multilateral and, to a lesser
degree, NGO assistance. A large part of that aid, especially that
given by the European Union and its Member States is being coordinated
within the framework of a specialised UN Agency, the United Nations
International Drug Control Programme (UNDCP). These programmes
started in the 70's and, since then, have been implemented in
the most important drug producing regions: the Golden Triangle
and Crescent of Asia, the Andean region of Latin America and in
some African countries.
<P>
The difficulties presented by the implementation of these programmes
are above all related to the fact that there is a lack of coherence
between the programme and the judicial and political contexts
they have to be executed in. On one hand, the programmes are implemented
in such as way as to satisfy the requirements established by the
International UN-Conventions on narcotic drugs (those of 1961,
1972 and 1988 respectively). These Conventions clearly mention
the need to eliminate the cultivation of prohibited substances
such as coca leaves, poppy and cannabis for non-medical purposes.
This implies that the target population of the alternative development
programme is considered to be violating the law, which hinders
the relation of mutual trust necessary between the two partners
in a development programme, ie the executors and the beneficiaries.
Without this trust, sustainable development is impossible. On
the other hand, the programme is executed within a context in
which a general rural development policy is virtually absent.
Conversely, many of the countries in question implement economic
measures that seriously affect the already marginalised rural
sector, such as the abolition of state support to the peasants,
the liberalisation of trade in agricultural products, etc. These
measures take place within the framework of a structural adjustment
programme elaborated by institutions that support the restructuring
of the economic policy of countries with an external debt, like
for instance the IMF, World Bank etc.
<P>
Finally, the economic policies implemented by developed countries
provoke an increased marginalisation from the global economy of
the peasant sector concerned, as a result of the low and fluctuating
commodity prices for their products and the unfair competition
caused by the flood of subsidised food imports to the national
peasant produce in developing countries. This phenomenon has gravely
damaged the perspective of the national productive apparatus in
general, and substitution programmes in particular.
<P>
Furthermore, serious criticism has been raised with regard to
the way in which the alternative development strategy has been
implemented by the concerned agencies, among others, the UNDCP.
This criticism refers to the fact that no distinction has been
made between cultivation for traditional use and cultivation for
drug production; that the dimensions of these programmes are often
exaggerated, with a disproportionate amount of funds being spent
on non-productive items and that their approach often fails to
foresee possible negative socio-economic and ecological outcomes.
There is evidence for example that the introduction of cash crops
as a result of alternative development programmes has generated
irreparable damage to the eco-system and to the traditional socio-economic
patterns of the population, which is, in most cases, indigenous.
Other crucial and consistent elements in this criticism of current
alternative development programmes are the lack of participation
by the target population in decision-making processes, as well
as the lack of coherence within a policy that promotes the commercialisation
of the alternative products.
<P>
In short, the alternative development strategy appears to be more
concentrated on the substitution of plants and less on the substitution
of rural poverty.
<H3>Alternative policies and practices</H3>

<P>
There is no doubt that the alternative development strategy, if
applied in an appropriate manner, is a positive answer to the
fundamental problem that lies beneath the massive production of
drugs, i.e. rural poverty. In order to  make the strategy more
effective in this sense, it is indispensable to establish a coherent
alternative development policy, whose main objective is not the
eradication of plants, but the eradication of poverty. This policy
has to aim at substituting the dependency on standard or illicit
mono-cropping, which actually characterises the situation of many
peasants in developing countries. In order to obtain this objective,
the policy should have international, national and local implications.
<P>
In the international sphere, promoting alternative development
requires the countering, in all appropriate fora, of the increasing
marginalisation of the small peasant sector in developing countries.
This can be done by addressing the adverse impact on this sector:
<UL>
<LI>of the low and fluctuating prices that their products are
subject to on the world market;
<LI>of the measures taken in the framework of the structural adjustment
programme, imposed by international financing institutions;
<LI>of the export of subsidised food products by developed countries
to developing countries.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
Furthermore, the alternative development strategy should not be
related to the execution of the International Conventions on Drugs,
which prohibit the cultivation of plants that can be used for
the manufacturing of drugs; conversely, the degree should be considered
in which this prohibition impedes the implementation of development
programmes, whose principal protagonists should be the growers
of these plants (at present considered as criminals by the International
Conventions).
<P>
On a national level, alternative development programmes should
be integrated in a rural development plan, that covers all areas
with a potential for agriculture. This plan should seek to obtain
economic progress for all, including credit, extension activities,
investigation and transference of new and adequate technologies,
and at the same time, adapt the model of self-sufficiency and
traditional technology, using it as a foundation of the economic
structure. Obviously, this rural development plan should also
include measures to protect national production, and above all
agricultural production, against competition from abroad.
<P>
On a local level, the approach of an alternative development programme
should be integrated, aiming at an economic model that enables
the target population to assure themselves fair incomes in the
framework of sustainable activities (with commercial perspectives
and respecting the environment). Therefore, the stability of the
peasants and their communities should be a first priority.
<P>
The foundation of the productive strategy should be food security,
with production for the local, national and international markets,
respectively, as its main production lines. On the international
market fair-trade products should be promoted. In the case of
agro-industrial projects, these should be articulated to the above-mentioned
priorities, and designed and implemented on the basis of profound
feasibility and marketing studies.
<P>
Under no circumstances should a production model be applied that
is damaging the local genetic biodiversity. As a consequence,
the cultivation of plants actually submitted for international
prohibition should be included among various possible production
lines, benefitting from the juridical possibilities that the current
Conventions might offer. For this purpose, investigations should
be carried out in order to determine potential beneficial applications
that these plants might have, also within an international context.
<H3>Strategies</H3>

<P>
In order to carry out a policy of alternative development, the
involvement and collaboration of two actors are indispensable:
the target population and the bilateral and multilateral agencies
in charge of financing and implementing the programmes. It is
very unlikely that all the changes suggested in the current alternative
development policy will occur soon. But already, the institutions
that implement it should carry out a critical evaluation of their
approach in close collaboration with the non-governmental organisations
that represent the target population, peasant organisations, and
local development organisations. According to the recommendations
that will result from this evaluation, the current programme should
be reformulated. Furthermore, in every possible degree, damage
caused by programmes that have already been concluded should be
repaired.
<P>
In order to improve the impact of alternative development programmes
in the future, these should be carried out with the agreement
and full participation of the target population in every phase
of the programmes: design, planning, implementation and evaluation.
To make sure that this participation is equitable, the programme's
objectives should be limited to the search for real development
options, and before these are found, no forced eradication of
illicit plants should be considered. In turn, investigations should
be carried out, together with specialised organisations, into
the way in which the commercialisation of beneficial derivatives
of these plants could open possible production lines.
<P>
The economical sustainability of the projects is to be guaranteed
by support to peasant organisations that enables them to maintain
optimum levels of development after the conclusion of the project.
On the other hand, local independent research organisations specialised
in development and environment should be supported in order to
monitor constantly the ecological and economical sustainability
of the development programme as it occurs. When the destination
of the products, prompted by an alternative development programme,
is the export market, international non-governmental organisations
that are in charge of so-called 'fair trade' schemes should be
contacted. This requires that peasant organisations should participate
in the control over the commercialisation and transformation of
their products, thus avoiding the possible undermining effects
of development on the essential food self-sufficiency activities.
<P>
Nevertheless, there is enough reason to doubt the sense that any
alternative development programmes might have if the macro-economic
measures are not taken to offer a market for the products it wants
to promote. These measures fail under the responsibility of the
supranational institutions.
<P>
The World Trade Organisation should eliminate the adverse impact
of the increasing liberalisation of international trade on the
small peasant sector, for instance through the establishment of
minimal and stable prices for the products that might be an option
for alternative development programmes. Financial institutions
like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund should
give priority to the elaboration of a rural development plan,
whose objective is to reactivate the agricultural sector based,
above all, on the fulfilment of local and national needs.
<P>
It is suggested that an institution like UNDCP, with the experience
and prestige it has obtained as being the UN specialised agency,
be the natural actor to suggest to the international community
the immediate need for adopting these measures. Furthermore, UNDCP
should, together with organisations specialised in the issue,
monitor global economic and financial policies, in order to give
sufficient warning of their possible adverse impact on the increase
of the drugs economy.<HR>

<H3>Contribution by <A NAME="lanza">Gregorio LANZA </A>- Bolivia
</H3>

<H3>''Features of the production and economic integration of illicit
crops''</H3>

<P>
The production of illicit crops is concentrated in backward or
developing economies.  This is the case with the poppy in Afghanistan,
Pakistan and Burma, the coca leaf in the high forests of the Andean
countries of Bolivia, Peru and Columbia and, more specifically,
within the framework of agricultural subsistence economies in
which other crops are not profitable.  
<P>
These illicit crops constitute the raw materials for the production
of drugs, for example the coca leaf for cocaine.  Although the
peasant producers are improving their living conditions, they
remain impoverished, and the &quot;coca-cocaine&quot; circuit
has a very significant economic impact on the overall economy
of these countries, creating employment and bringing in foreign
currency.
<P>
In many cases, the increase in the production of illicit crops
has coincided with periods of economic crisis and structural adjustment
policies.
<P>
The supply of illicit crops is in response to the pressure of
demand from the international market.  In this fashion, certain
countries are able to reintegrate into the world economy.  The
globalisation of the economy has an adverse impact on raw materials
as such on the economies of the South.
<P>
The imbalances that result from the production and processing
of illicit crops in the economies of countries affected by these
activities will take a long time to overcome. 
<H3>Concept of alternative development</H3>

<P>
The United Nations International Drug Control Programme (UNDCP)
defines alternative development programmes as follows:
<P>
These are programmes created to promote the efforts of developing
countries to eliminate the production or processing of illicit
drugs in their territory.  Such programmes may assist governments
in setting up and designing alternative socio-economic policies
for peasants involved in the production of illicit crops and raw
materials.  They may facilitate and further the transition of
an entire country from economic dependence on production and trafficking
to a development strategy based on products other than narcotic
drugs.
<P>
At the Berlin Conference, a concept was proposed similar to the
one above: alternative development is defined as a process designed
to eliminate and prevent the production of crops intended for
the manufacture of illicit drugs by rural development measures
specifically designed to sustain national economic growth.  It
must include social and economic measures and must also be based
on the gradual reduction of crops in the drug growing regions
through easily accessible technical and financial assistance.
<P>
For its part, the American administration takes the position that:
it is generally possible to gauge success as a function of the
reduction of the production of and trafficking in narcotic drugs.
 However, the alternative development process is a long-term project,
and consequently, it is neither useful nor appropriate to measure
&quot;short-term&quot; success, such as the reduction in production
from one year to the next. 
<P>
The Government of the United States assesses the success of alternative
development on the basis of:
<P>
i. the number of licit jobs compared to the number of jobs in
coca cultivation;
<P>
ii. income from licit activities as against income from coca cultivation;

<P>
iii. total legally-generated foreign currency as opposed  to foreign
currency originating in coca plant production.
<P>
The Bolivian Government declares in its &quot;national strategy
for alternative development&quot; that it proposes to replace
the economy of the coca plant and its derivatives through the
creation of jobs generating income that will be able to make up
for the loss of employment and of revenue from illegal activities.
 Alternative economic development aims to offset with rapid financial
assistance, the social and economic cost of programmes to destroy
illicit coca crops and will also promote the structural change
needed to overcome the external asphyxiation to which the economy
of the country will be exposed as a result.
<P>
It is clear that there is no standard criterion, at any rate in
relation to the three following subjects:
<P>
1. Is only the income generated by crops to be replaced or the
economic activities created by the entire circuit?
<P>
2. Must the results be measured as a function of the surface area
of destroyed crops or on the basis of socio-economic parameters?
<P>
3. Is there a close correlation between the eradication of illicit
crops and drug demand?  Also, what role is played here by the
consumer countries?
<H3>Investments and markets</H3>

<P>
Investments for alternative development (in millions of US dollars,
for 1984-1995)

<P>
Estimates based on data from the &quot;Andean Counter-Drug Initiative&quot;,
UNSAID - Bolivia, UNDCP Peru and Bolivia.
<P>
As we can see from this table, investments are low.  In the case
of Bolivia, for example, they amount to an average of 13 million
dollars annually; even if the 50 million dollars spent on destroying
25,000 hectares of coca plants were added, the annual average
would still be only 18 million dollars.  If this is compared with
the income generated by the coca plant and its derivatives, which
for Bolivia is estimated at 500 million dollars and for Peru at
2,000 million dollars annually, it is fair to say that these investments
are negligible.  As to the markets of the countries of the North,
they are blocked by quasi-tariff measures, which prevent any importation
of crops legally grown in the countries of the South.
<H3>Results</H3>

<P>
By and large, the results are limited, whether for job creation,
the generation of foreign currency or crop substitution.
<H3>The case of Bolivia </H3>

<P>
In Bolivia, alternative development has not had an effect for
three reasons:
<P>
i. modular projects that are small in scale and without economic
impact;
<P>
ii. little peasant participation;
<P>
iii. technical mistakes relating to the types of substitution
crops and markets envisaged.
<P>
In the years 1984-1989, attempts were made to resolve these problems,
notably in the agro-industrial units of UNDCP, so as to achieve
better quality and raise peasant participation.  The infrastructure
was improved somewhat.
<H3>The case of Peru</H3>

<P>
In the case of Peru, alternative development has been concentrated
primarily in the region of traditional production.  The violence
in the region of Huallaga has made it impossible to encourage
alternative development in the largest areas. However, in the
past two years, 1994-1995, cocoa and cocaine production has faced
a crisis of overproduction and a collapse in prices, in some cases
exceeding 300%.  This might stimulate the cultivation of alternative
crops - see the example of cocoa and its industrialisation, which
has benefited from the experience of and infrastructure developed
by the UNDCP.
<H3>The case of Colombia</H3>

<P>
The case of Columbia is somewhat unique because of its initial
situation as a country that processed drugs from the raw material
grown in Bolivia and Peru.  In the past two years, however, coca
production in Colombia has increased in surface area, from 30,000
to nearly 80,000 hectares.  In this new context, efforts are being
made to give fresh impetus to alternative development.  In the
past, projects receiving the special support of the UNDCP, and
which have been administered by the Government of Colombia in
the regions of southern Cauca, Piamonte de Putumayo, San Jos&eacute;
de Guavire and in Nari&ntilde;o have accounted for an investment
of 20 million dollars.
<H3>The current situation</H3>

<P>
Despite all the experience accumulated in the area of alternative
development, and notwithstanding the official declarations in
1995 of the Governments of Peru, Columbia and Bolivia, alternative
development policies have given way to the forced eradication
of coca crops.  The resulting situation of violence has created
an obstacle to the smooth functioning of alternative development
projects.
<H3>Problems to be raised</H3>

<P>
1. If long-term policies are involved, the results must be measured
with socio-economic parameters, which are not only meaningful
for over a long period.  If short-term policies are to be employed,
the sole measure would be the reduction of the number of hectares
of illicit crops.
<P>
2. Investment is insufficient.  The markets are limited by protectionist
measures, particularly those of a quasi-tariff nature.  In this
context, how can shared responsibility and the policies of the
North find their expression?
<P>
3. How can the contradiction be resolved between extremely open
economies and the free market, on the one hand, and the participation
of state and international bodies intervening in the alternative
development economy, on the other?
<P>
4. How can a consensus be reached with the coca-producing peasants,
if at the same time a sort of war has been declared against them?
 The forced destruction of their crops by fumigation is a threat
to human lives and to the environment.  
<P>
5. If we are aware that the problem is worldwide, how can demand,
which drives the supply, be reduced?

The environmental impact of the drug economy and of development
alternatives
<H3><A HREF="#rumrill">Roger RUMRILL - Peru </A></CENTER></H3>

<H3><A NAME="theme3"></A>Contribution by Roger RUMRILL - Peru
</H3>

<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P>
Drug trafficking has existed in Andean countries, particularly
in Peru, for a quarter of a century.  From the outset, in the
1970s, the illegal drug economy using the coca leaf as its raw
material, has had a devastating effect on the legal economy, social
and cultural organisation, politics, the environment and ecology.
<P>
In the specific case of Peru, the illegal coca economy has been
and still is linked to guerilla movements such as the Sendero
Luminoso (Shining Path) and the MRTA (Tupac Amaru Revolutionary
Movement).  This illegal activity has also infiltrated the armed
forces and the police, which are supposed to be fighting it.
This considerable economic force, which injects an average of
one billion dollars every year (30% of Peru's exports) into the
Peruvian economy, distorts the economic process in the region.
<P>
The effect on the environment and regional ecology is very negative.
 Peru, the world's leading producer of coca leaves, with roughly
300,000 hectares of plantations, has had to clear more than one
million hectares of rainforest in the tropical region of the Amazon,
where coca plants are grown on natural terraces between 600 and
1500 metres above sea-level.  The damage caused by this deforestation
is not confined to erosion and impoverishment of tropical soil
but includes also a progressive and rapid depletion of biodiversity.
<P>
There is also very extensive contamination of rivers and soil.
 The engineer Buenaventura Marcelo Tadeo calculated that in order
to process the production from 160,000 hectares of coca plants
(yielding an average of 2,400 kilos per hectare per year), in
1987 alone, 57 million litres of kerosene, 32 million litres of
sulphuric acid, 16,000 tonnes of quicklime, 3,200 tonnes of carbide,
16,000 tonnes of toilet paper, 6,400,000 litres of acetone and
a similar amount of toluene were needed.  All these chemical wastes
are dumped into the rivers and lakes of the Amazon valley and
are extremely harmful to wildlife and human health.
<H3>Regional, national and international policies</H3>

<P>
Unfortunately, national and international policies are not working
on a global solution to the problem of drug trafficking.
<P>
United States' government policy, particularly since the Republicans
took control of Congress in December 1994, has concentrated on
a strategy to eradicate coca, marijuana and opium poppy plantations,
and has ignored the economic and social parameters of the problem.
<P>
This pressure to eradicate plantations has tended to militarise
the drugs war, which, in turn, has eroded the democratic foundations
of Andean countries and brought about increased corruption in
state structures and frequent human rights abuses in the region.
<P>
International macro-economic policies, structural adjustment programmes
and the unbridled application of the neo-liberal model have served
to stimulate the illegal economies in Andean countries.  In Peru,
Bolivia and Colombia the expansion of coca, opium poppy and marijuana
cultivation is directly linked to the opening up of the free market,
the decrease in customs tariffs and the protectionism of the North.
 The prices of legal crops such as rice, maize and others have
fallen because of unfair competition from imported produce.  This
has forced farmers into illegal activities.
<P>
Since the second half of 1995, coca leaf prices have fallen in
Peru to their lowest level for a quarter of a century.  The reasons
can be found in the overproduction of raw materials and processed
drugs, the increasing autonomy of national cartels and &quot;businesses&quot;
and the partial dismantling of the production, supply and transport
systems.
<P>
In Peru, the government of President Fujimori has decided to withdraw
the army from the war against drug trafficking giving, as one
of its reasons, the many corruption scandals that have been uncovered.
 The national police have once again been made responsible for
this activity.  However, no effective economic and social policy
has been implemented to deal with the crisis among coca plant
producers and help the country reach a structural solution to
the problem.
<H3>Alternatives</H3>

<P>
A quarter of a century after the beginning of the drug trafficking
era, particularly cocaine trafficking, policies to control and
reduce both demand and supply have proved ineffective.  Drug trafficking
today is pandemic.
<P>
All these policies and their underlying philosophical concepts
should now be reviewed, at international, national and regional
level.
<P>
In the case of Andean countries, United States' policy (&quot;Andean
drugs war&quot;) should be the first to be reviewed.  After more
than a decade of implementation of this policy, the problem of
coca leaf, opium poppy and marijuana production and their export
to the United States and Europe has not been resolved;  in fact,
quite the reverse, the problem has worsened.
<P>
One example is the expansion of land used for coca plant crops
in the Peruvian valley of Huallaga, which is the biggest coca
leaf production area in the world.  In 1970 at the beginning of
the drugs era, there were only 7,000 hectares of coca plants in
this valley, whereas today there are more than 200,000.  It is
important also not to forget the frequent human rights abuses
and corruption scandals that occur.
<P>
The concepts of shared responsibility and globality should also
be reviewed.  The debate should be approached from an economic
angle with a view to resolving the problem of rural poverty in
Andean countries and in all countries which grow illegal crops
as raw materials for natural drugs.  Mostly these are Third World
countries, except in the case of the United States, which is the
world's leading producer of marijuana.
<H3>Strategies</H3>

<P>
Given the wide range of interests at stake, most countries, particularly
those in the North which are the biggest consumers of drugs, refuse
to review or change their drugs policies.  National and regional
bodies are not sufficiently powerful to urge them to take the
necessary decisions.
<P>
The countries concerned could have an opportunity to negotiate
radical changes in their policies at the World Drugs Summit to
be held in 1997.  Consensus on the need for this Summit exists
among all the countries except the United States.
<P>
Structural adjustment policies, the unrestricted opening up of
our borders and protectionism among the rich nations of the North
have all contributed to the spread of poverty and consequently
to the expansion of illegal crops just as the recession has contributed
to expansion in the demand for drugs in industrialised countries.
 The only option is to redefine these policies and try to establish
a balanced relationship with developing countries.
<P>
As far as the Andean countries are concerned, a programme or strategy
for the whole region is needed urgently to enable them to negotiate
with the United States.  It is only in consensus that the Andean
countries will be able to resist the pressure for eradication
and militarisation from the United States.
<P>
Another step, particularly for Peru and Bolivia, would be to secure
the decriminalisation of the coca leaf and its withdrawal from
the list of narcotics drawn up by the 1961 Single Convention in
Vienna.
<P>
For the tropical regions of the Andes where the coca plant is
grown, it is essential to start a process of crop conversion.
 The damage caused to the environment by the production and processing
of coca plants is a threat to the greatest biodiversity of our
planet.

LABROUSSE </A>- France</H2>

<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P>
On the illicit drugs front, the 1990s have been marked by two
phenomena: an explosion of production and trafficking in their
&quot;traditional&quot; areas and resultant contamination of new
regions, chiefly the territories of the former Communist countries
in Eastern Europe and the African countries south of the Sahara.
In both regions, these phenomena occur against a background of
political and economic upheaval whose salient feature is the establishment
of democratisation processes and ultra-liberal policies. While
action at the political level is difficult, at the economic level
a number of adjustments would avert the undesirable effects of
liberal policies on drug production and dealing.
<H3>The former Communist countries' role in the trade</H3>

<P>
The former communist countries, whose respective yields were once
intended for local consumption, have a tendency to be caught up
in international dealing: Kazakhstan for cannabis derivatives,
Tajikistan, Uzbekistan or Ukraine for opium poppy derivatives.
These two types of production, though expanding extremely rapidly,
have not yet attained significance on the world drug market. The
main changes in the trading processes in fact stem from the break-up
of the Soviet-dominated Eastern Bloc. The first effect is that
the confined space of the bloc, ruled by its own internal logic,
has been restored to a wide-open state both for the previous marketing
traditions and the new polarities of international commerce. Secondly,
tendencies towards completely unregulated trade practice have
been strongly accentuated by this sudden opening-up and by the
infirmity of economies and societies abruptly subjected to the
elementary laws of predation and survival. Furthermore, drug trafficking
as a quick source of capital gain and the interpenetrating arms
traffic which it finances revolve around the markets created by
war in the former Yugoslavia and conflict in the Caucasus and
Central Asia.
<P>
The Turkish organisations are present on the terminal portions
of these drug pipelines. Albanians from Kosovo and the Former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia are also active on the route through
the Balkans and the Italian Adriatic ports. Bulgaria and Romania
are transit points for the Turkish, Russian and Caucasian connections.
Turkish narcotics dealers are present not only along the older
Mediterranean routes dominated by the Italian Mafia, but also
the more independent new Balkan routes, the preserve of the Russians
and Caucasians. The Balkan trade has overland and seaborne variants
which are endlessly multiplied by the involvement of Lebanese
and Kurds to the South and Serbs and Croats to the North.
<H3>African drug growing and distribution</H3>

<P>
Cannabis, introduced into East and Central Africa as from the
14th century, did not reach most West African countries until
after World War II. In all parts its use was of a folk nature.
Deterioration of national economic situations in the 1970s and
remedial application of structural adjustment programmes in the
1980s brought rapid expansion of the crops. In many African countries
today, they represent the sole expedient enabling farmers to weather
the recession, especially as the local authorities turn a blind
eye or are implicated in the traffic. Certain countries - Nigeria,
Ghana, Ivory Coast, Senegal and others - supply the regional markets
and export increasing quantities of their production to Europe.
<P>
Since the early 1980s, Africa has also become a major transit
route (air and sea) for heroin being delivered from Southwest
and Southeast Asia to the USA and Europe, as well as cocaine from
America bound for Europe. The initial leadership of the Nigerian
rings has given way to a trend towards multinational structuring
of networks: Kenyans, Tanzanians, Zairians, Senegalese, etc. Although
the traffickers long preferred East African ports for transhipping
consignments, particularly hashish originating from Southeast
Asia, growing use of West African ports where customs officials
are very readily bribed is observed. It has also been noted that
the Moroccan traffickers use the coasts of the Cape Verde Islands
and Senegal, handy to the Spanish and North African coasts.
<H3>Alternative policies</H3>

<P>
Both regions of the world, though very different in many respects,
are affected by situations with a number of points in common which
account for the development of illicit activities.
<P>
1. Conflict situations in a number of countries: [Tajikistan,
Azerbaijan, Armenia, Chechnya, former Yugoslavia; Somalia, Rwanda,
Chad, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Senegal]. (See text on conflicts).
<P>
2. Elsewhere, it is the democratisation process which gives rise
to the illicit tradings. Indeed, the new democratic parties are
looking for alternative resources whether legal or illegal to
counter the old single parties which usually retain part of the
resources monopolised by the state structures [Russia, Georgia,
Ukraine, Romania, etc.; Mozambique, Guinea, Chad, Ivory Coast,
etc.].
<P>
3. All these countries are nevertheless alike in being under constraint
from the international financial organisations to accept economic
liberalisation policies: privatisation, application of structural
adjustment plans, etc. This is the level where it may well be
possible to act by making alterations in these policies which
would remedy their ill-effects:
<P>
a) privatisation: ensure that it is not carried out through laundering
of mafia money [East Germany, Russia, Bulgaria, Romania, etc].
<P>
b) ensure that branches of European banks in these countries do
not take advantage of their location to engage in practices forbidden
them in the West [Hungary].
<P>
c) possible proposals for agricultural policy:
<P>
giving poor farmers access to production resources subsidised
by means of inexpensive loans;
<P>
maintaining arable acreage and safeguarding land tenure;
<P>
hedging the prices of local produce against imports;
<P>
guarding against fluctuations in world rates for exported agricultural
products;
<P>
diversifying revenue sources by diversifying agricultural and
non-agricultural activities;
<P>
founding agricultural organisations which are not empty shells
that merely act as political relays but can form real countervailing
powers which give farmers a firmer footing on which to negotiate.
<P>
Needless to say, all these proposals run counter to the policy
laid down by the World Bank and the international finance bodies.

<H3>''New Producers and Traders: The Emergence of New Criminal
Organisations, particularly in Central and Eastern Europe''</H3>

<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P>
One of the more remarkable aspects of the expansion of the drug
trade has been the spread of addiction and the drug economy to
the Third World and to the former socialist countries in Central
and Eastern Europe. In my paper, I am going to concentrate on
the latter region.
<P>
Drug abuse has been a fact of life in Eastern and Central Europe
since the late 1960's, but although illegal drug abuse is far
from uncommon, illegal trafficking and organised crime have yet
to take hold.
<P>
Before speaking about the new producers, traders and consumers,
let me take a brief look at the old ones, I mean, the drug-scene
during the socialist period.
<P>
In that time, the main features of the drug problem were the following:
owing to the nature of the economy (planned economy run by the
state), the political system (one-party state) and the strict
social control of every day life, the drug trade to fulfil the
demand of the market had not been formed. Drug trafficking was
small, the 'real drugs' (such as opium, heroin, cocaine, and cannabis
derivatives) were missing and the drug problem was not linked
to criminality. (For example, in Hungary, the wide- spread form
of drug abuse was 'glue-sniffing'). We could say the drug problem,
particularly the demand for drugs, had already started in Central
and Eastern Europe during the socialist period. I think the most
important finding of that time is that drug abuse in a society
can come to exist without the supply of 'real' drugs.
<P>
The above-mentioned features of the drug scene in the region have
changed since the collapse of the former regime. Today, all elements
of the drug problem in the Western countries are present in the
countries in question. Thus, for example, illicit trafficking
to meet the domestic demand has started and there has been an
attempt to produce home-made drugs. There is an extremely wide
variety of illegal drugs available, and money-laundering actions
related to the illegal drug business have appeared in Central
and Eastern Europe. However, I must add that 'Central and Eastern
Europe' is just a geographical and political common name for a
territory. In this territory, there are many countries with the
same social difficulties, but with many differences from the point
of view of culture, development, and the facts of social life,
like the drug problem, Let us examine a few examples of the common
features and differences in the field of the drug problem, which
in addition, illustrate the new producers and the new criminal
organisations.
<P>
According to the official figures, the number of drug consumers
is 1.5 million in Russia. In Moscow, you can get all kinds of
drugs. The narcotics Mafia of organised drug sellers and buyers
have controlled over-trafficking in the country. The estimated
income of the Mafia was more than 0.5 billion dollars in 1995.
''Cannabis sativa'' has grown to roughly 1 million hectares, for
producing marijuana (about 1 million tons per year). For Colombian
cocaine cartels, the target country, or at least the distributive
country, is Russia. The law enforcement agencies have discovered
two university laboratories which manufactured synthetic drugs
for the Mafia. 
<P>
In Hungary, we have had another kind of problem. Although the
number of consumers has been increasing (their number is about
25-30,000), our country is mainly a way station for the movement
of drugs, given that its borders are no longer secure. The other
reason: the so-called Balkan-route, that is, the route of smuggling
heroin from South-Eastern Asia to Western Europe, has been transferred
to Northern countries so that Hungary (and the Czech and the Slovak
Republics) have become the predominant transit countries for drug
trafficking. (In Hungary, less than 4 kg heroin, 2.5 kg hashish
were seized in 1990, while in 1995 more than 500 kg heroin and
also more than 500 kg hashish were seized). The territorial monopoly
of the Balkan-route belongs to the Mafia's in Turkey, and the
Albanian Mafia's are also quite involved in the illicit drug smuggling
that is crossing Hungary. Further new features of the drug trafficking
and producing in Hungary: the production of amphetamines in illegal
laboratories, or in an illicit way, to transport to the Netherlands
and Sweden, ''cannabis tours'' to the Netherlands, domestic production
of cannabis, cocaine trafficking headed by a Nigerian network,
and newer drugs on the market are amphetamine derivatives (i.e.
metaphetamin: Ecstasy-pill).
<P>
By the mid-nineties, illicit drug trafficking, which is a part
of international organised crime, had reached Hungary. Hungarian
citizens are involved in this business. So far, national organised
crime has appeared in different territories mainly in the field
of tourism, trafficking in foreign currencies, prostitution, theft
of cars, and smuggling people. Hungarian and foreign dealers sell
drugs on the domestic market. Distribution of drugs ordinarily
takes place indoors, particularly in restaurants; very few sales
occur on the street.
<P>
The situation is basically the same in the Czech and Slovak Republics
and Poland as in Hungary, with the difference that, in the latter,
synthetic drugs (mainly amphetamines), are produced in large quantities
to be smuggled in Scandinavia.
<H3>Drug policy issues</H3>

<P>
Central and Eastern European countries have joined the UN Conventions
on the drug issue (1961, 1974) and have ratified the UN Covenant
of 1988 Against Illicit Traffic on Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic
Substances. In addition to the mentioned international conventions,
these countries have taken into account the documents of the Council
of Europe, when forming their drug policy. For example, when Hungary
modified the articles on the Criminal Code concerning the drug
problem in 1993, the experts who prepared the Bill took into consideration
Recommendation n&#186;1085 of the 40th Plenary Session of the
Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. Based upon the
mentioned international and regional documents, the goal of the
drug policies of these countries is ''harm reduction'', and they
implement the ''double strategy'' in criminal law. It means there
are huge differences between the severity of punishment of the
consumer and the trafficker.
<P>
What is the impact of this policy in the region? First of all,
the drug problem is treated as a legal issue, which could be controlled
mainly by means of criminal law. Because of this feature, the
law enforcement agencies have had the central role in the drug
policy in Central and Eastern Europe. Among the total number of
criminals, are an increasing number of drug offenders, particularly
traffickers. (For example, in Hungary, the number of registered
offenders was 37 in 1990, and 324 in 1994). In spite of the fact
that, on the one side, most of the consumers belong to disadvantaged
social groups, and on the other side, drug trafficking is good
business, the drug policy of these countries has neglected the
social policy and economic aspects of the drug problem.
<H3>Alternative policies and practices</H3>

<P>
If we are looking for alternative policies, we should take into
consideration the actual social and economic process in the region,
namely the privatisations of the economy and the social consequences
of this process. These countries do not have enough financial
resources and capital for privatising the economy. The governments
make efforts to cut the social policy budget in order to obtain
resources to revitalise the economy.
<P>
Certain groups of individuals, who do not have the necessary financial
resources either to become legal participants in the business
life, join in the ''black economy'', of which drug trafficking
is a very fruitful field. Both efforts have influence on the drug
problem. If we take into consideration the above-mentioned processes
and the results of the latest general elections in these countries,
we have to understand: these countries need financial sources
to revitalise the legal economy and to ensure money for social
policy and welfare is available, because one of the most important
values for their citizens is the right to social security.
<P>
Alternative policy should mean an alternative international finance
policy which should respect the above-mentioned situation and
value of the given region. 
<H3>Recommendations </H3>

<P>
Today, we do not have a comprehensive and real picture of the
drug problem in Central and Eastern Europe. For this reason, the
fundamental recommendation is that we should carry out a comparative
epidemiological, criminological, and legal research on this issue.
<P>
International NGOs should monitor and evaluate the loan and credit
policy of the international organisations.
<P>
Local NGOs should monitor the features of the ''black market''
organised crime, and the relationship between these social facts
and the tendency of the drug problem, as well as the legal regulations
in relation to these issues.

<H3>Regulations governing drugs and psychotropic substances</H3>

<P>
Legislation on drugs, which serves as a framework for policies
aimed at controlling the production, distribution and use of certain
natural and also synthetic substances, legally defined as &quot;drugs&quot;
and medically defined as &quot;psychotropic substances&quot;,
has gradually taken form during this century, partly due to a
number of international conventions.  These international conventions
(firstly on opium, then other drugs and, later, psychotropic substances)
aimed to restrict the trade in such products to solely medical
purposes.  They represent a trend moving from administrative control
to control through criminal law measures and from the prohibition
of the products to the &quot;indirect&quot; prohibition of their
use.
<P>
Without going into the details of international regulations, it
can be said that prohibition has been gradually configured around
three main axes:
<UL>
<LI><I>the prohibition of the production and distribution extraneous
to the qualities authorised for therapeutic purposes</I>, enshrined
little by little in the first international conventions (from
the Shanghai Conference on Opium in 1909 to the Single Convention
on Narcotic Drugs and the Convention on Psychotropic Substances,
both of 1971);
<LI><I>enforcement measures against trafficking</I>, enshrined
in the single Convention and firmly reinforced by the Vienna Convention
on illicit trafficking in drugs and psychotropic substances of
1988;
<LI>enforcement measures against purchase, possession and growing
for personal use, introduced by the Vienna Convention of 1988.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
National legislation has evolved in parallel to and sometimes
ahead of international law.  In Western countries, particularly
in Europe, the different national legislations form a relatively
coherent whole, which can be outlined as follows:
<UL>
<LI><I>enforcement measures against consumption</I>, either directly
or indirectly, through the punishment of possession, eased by
various forms of alternative treatment;
<LI>increasing enforcement efforts against trafficking;
<LI><I>extension of control through criminal law</I>, through
the definition of new offences.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
This means that prohibition of the production of natural base
substances is shaped by international conventions and the individual
legislation of the producer countries.  Prohibition of the transformation,
distribution and consumption of substances is conditioned by international
conventions (including European treaties) and the individual legislation
of both producer and consumer countries.
<H3>The application of international and national law</H3>

<P>
Paradoxically, despite the failures of enforcement policies aimed
at curbing production, trafficking and consumption, there was
an all-out offensive of enforcement measures in the 1980s.  Declarations
of war on drugs abounded.
<P>
Every war has its victims.  In this case, it is the farmer-producers,
small-time smugglers, user-suppliers and users, and in particular
the intravenous users of &quot;hard drugs&quot;, known as drug
addicts: in a nutshell, the weak links of the chain.  Other victims
have been certain principles of international and domestic law,
together with certain human rights which were trampled upon or,
in any case, not taken into account in this war, in which, increasingly,
any means serving the end of eliminating drugs is permissible.
<P>
Other documents will focus on the negative effects generated in
producer countries by limiting crop production to medical purposes,
eradication programmes and measures against trafficking.  To give
just a few examples, we could mention the development of a kind
of right of interference by the countries of the North (there
are the interventions by the United States in Latin America but
also the conditions sometimes attached to European development
aid policies), the militarisation of anti-production and -trafficking
measures, entailing a generalised restriction of freedoms (eg
in Colombia in the 1990s) and, more recently, the substitution
of heroine consumption for traditional opium consumption, giving
rise to eradication programmes in some Asian countries.
<P>
In Europe, and Western Europe in particular, measures to combat
trafficking have failed to curb this phenomenon, according to
national and also international police forces, which link the
increased number of confiscations to the increased flow of substances.
 The demands of this combat have produced three kinds of negative
or even harmful effects, however:
<P>
a) exceptions made to the general principles of law and human
rights violations arising from the introduction of national emergency
legislation;
<P>
b) the assertion of the need to punish consumers as a means of
persecuting traffickers;
<P>
c) the deterioration of health and socio-economic circumstances
of users, particularly addicts.
<P>
We can illustrate this with a few examples:
<P>
a) laws aimed at combatting drug trafficking seem to be evolving
towards an ever greater number of exceptions to the principles
of national legislation and violations of international and national
human rights norms.
<P>
For example, certain extensions of police powers (custody, night-time
house-searches, delivery surveillance etc) common to the legislation
of most European countries, introduce differential treatment between
drugs offenders and other offenders, violating the <I>principle
of equality before the law</I>;  the shift in the burden of proof,
provided for in the area of money laundering for example, limits
the <I>rights of the defence</I> and cancels the <I>presumption
of innocence</I>.  This constitutes a violation of three fundamental
principles of criminal law established by both national legislation
and human rights conventions.
<P>
b) national policies on drug use have alternated in the past between
an approach focusing on law enforcement and an approach with greater
emphasis on medical aspects.  Since the Vienna Convention, there
seems to have been a trend towards stronger law enforcement in
different countries: in Italy and Sweden, which introduced new
criminal legislation against drug users (later repealed in Italy);
in Spain, which introduced an administrative penalty for consumption
in public; and even in the Netherlands which, while maintaining
the most liberal policy of all European countries, are showing
less tolerance towards foreign drug users.
<P>
Only AIDS seems capable of reversing this trend, as it obliges
countries to develop policies of risk reduction.  Such policies
are operated in parallel with criminal measures against users
however, and in particular there seems to be an increasing divergence
between the users benefiting from substitution programmes and
those who do not, exacerbating the situation of the latter.  While
the Vienna Convention advocated the punishment of users as a means
of combating trafficking, the most recent European meetings have
revealed a consensus that punishment is a useful means of making
users seek treatment.  Thought should be given to the real reasons
for this attitude, as it contrasts so starkly with the consensus
established in medical circles that access to socio-therapeutic
programmes which are not freely decided is ineffective.
<P>
c) In all European countries, drug users are subject to criminal
proceedings and imprisonment, either for actual use or for minor
trafficking or other such offences.  In France, 66 to 76% of drugs
arrests between 1972 and 1994 concerned users and 13 to 24% user-suppliers.
 In Italy, in the first half of 1994, drug addicts accounted for
32.6% of the prison population.
<P>
The penal environment has a definite repressive impact on the
living conditions of these subjects, particularly those dependent
on heroine.  Furthermore, it hampers the monitoring of socio-therapeutic
projects.  Drug consumption develops above all in underprivileged
environments and when users encounter penal measures, they fall
into a downward spiral of increasing marginalisation and worsened
socio-economic circumstances, job prospects and health conditions.
 On this latter point, it must be stressed that the countries
which clamp down most firmly on users seem to be those which are
the last to introduce policies to prevent the risk of HIV contamination.
 The proportion of intravenous drug users among known HIV-positives
and AIDS sufferers and the high percentage of users contaminated
with HIV and AIDS are indicative of the perverse effects of strong
enforcement policies.  The high and known risks of overdose following
forced severances in prison are also worth underlining.
<P>
Nowhere, except perhaps in the Netherlands, are drug users considered
as citizens.  Being a community with reduced rights, often before
they begin consuming, they are crushed by repressive policies,
instead of receiving support through policies fostering their
access to fundamental rights.  Yet rights to the free development
of one's personality, social life, work, housing, freedom and
health are recognised both at national level (in certain constitutions
or domestic laws) and international level (Universal Declaration
of Human Rights of the United Nations, European Convention for
the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, European
Social Charter etc).
<H3>For an alternative policy</H3>

<P>
In both North and South, the drugs issue masks complex and often
serious situations.  Although the phenomena linked to it differ,
they all seem to be symptomatic of unsuitable social and economic
models and a lack of equality where the enjoyment of fundamental
rights by individuals and peoples are concerned.
<P>
An alternative policy ought therefore to take a global approach,
striking at the causes as well as the symptoms.  In which case,
it seems obvious that policies aimed at reducing unemployment,
cleaning up and integrating suburbs, general education and youth-oriented
policies would be far more effective than specific anti-drug policies.
<P>
However, these specific policies are <I>a priori</I> not without
their uses: the problem is to make them effective and ensure that
they respect the rights of those targeted.  Nevertheless a new
model is needed, and we must think in terms of alternative policies.
 A change of pattern in Western countries means a) attaching priority
to health, regarded as both a medical and social condition, and
b) considering drug users as citizens with full rights.  This
would engender a necessary diversification of policies geared
to the different substances, user populations and modes of use,
and a generalisation of risk reduction policies, extended to cover
the social and economic risks run by users.
<P>
It is not just a matter, therefore, of intensifying prevention
programmes to combat consumption as a health risk and providing
a range of socio-therapeutic support mechanisms but also of devising
policies to provide users with concrete assistance and support
for resolving problems in their everyday lives and finding their
place in society and working life.  Finally, it is necessary to
foster a positive image of users which, by replacing the negative
image of drug addicts, encourages firstly the users to think that
they can &quot;kick the habit&quot; and secondly the public not
to resist integration policies.
<P>
But these policies are not enough to ensure that the new model
will be effective, if the users are still forced underground,
partly by the need to supply their habit from illegal markets
and partly by the necessity of raising money for these extremely
expensive supplies through crime.
<P>
Various options are open to us, and they do not necessarily require
the legalisation of the products.  All the legal rules in force
are aimed at restricting the movement and consumption of drugs
and psychotropic substances to medical use.  If it is accepted
that the mental and physical health of drug-using citizens must
be protected and is as much under threat from the spells of detention
which are bound to befall an &quot;addict&quot; as the consumption
of substances in illegal circumstances, the provision of substances
within a medically-controlled circuit to users who cannot do without
them is compatible with the existing rules.
<P>
The examples set by Switzerland and England show that it is possible,
not only to develop substitution programmes (eg with methadone)
but also to dispense heroine which, if monitored for quality,
used with uncontaminated instruments and followed by more general
socio-therapeutic supervision, can help users gradually regain
their place in society (as demonstrated by the initial assessment
of the experimental heroine distribution programmes in Switzerland)
and, perhaps, even halt their consumption.
<P>
The reinsertion of users into a context of legality does not only
entail their reinstatement as persons recognised in law but would
also reduce risks to society; it is society, after all, which
suffers from offences related to the use of certain substances
and from the cost of law enforcement policies which, in many countries,
is considerably higher (and substantially linked to the punishment
of users) than the cost of prevention and care.
<P>
It may be assumed that the reduction of drug-related delinquency,
the redirecting of expenditure and also the gradual disappearance
of users from the context of illegality would change public opinion
in the long term and, consequently, generate more respect for
the rights of drug-using citizens.
<P>
Within such a policy framework, it would be a good idea to distribute
drugs and not just substitution products for two reasons: a) gaining
the loyalty of users, so that they do not return to the illegal
drugs market (it is known that users on methadone programmes often
continue to consume heroine on a more or less occasional basis)
and, consequently, b) gradually reducing the room available for
illegal drugs selling, making it less and less attractive for
trafficking networks.
<P>
Finally, it must not be forgotten to review the transgressions
perpetrated by anti-trafficking (and also anti-demand) policies
against the fundamental principles of criminal law.  Even if we
were obliged to admit (which is not the case) that the end justifies
the means, it must be pointed out that the value of such transgressions
is far from proven.  Nevertheless, they continue to spread into
new areas, calling into question one of the base institutions
of democracy, namely justice.
<H3>Paving the way for effective strategies</H3>

<P>
Current political conditions, both nationally and internationally,
suggest that the adoption of a new model will not be easy.  It
requires a change of mentalities and a change of tune, but also
more knowledge and less mystery as regards common ground.  This
seems to require working links between at least four sectors:
the NGOs on the ground (focusing on drugs, poverty, suburbs etc),
human rights NGOs (rarely dealing with drug-related problems),
academic circles and local administrations committed to alternative
policies within their catchment areas.
<P>
One of the obstacles to policy changes is the opportunistic use
of false truths in order to justify current policies and conceal
the real issues.  An effort to rationalise, pass on and possibly
expand upon existing verifiable knowledge is a prerequisite for
any action.  This knowledge exists but is fragmented at present.
 A comparison of alternative practices existing in various countries
at local and national level is also essential, to gauge the feasibility,
effectiveness and reproducibility required to form a basis for
a shift to other policy models.  We believe that grassroots operatives
and theoreticians must join forces in:
<P>
a) analysing the <I>real issues</I> of existing policies;
<P>
b) analysing and evaluating the <I>effects</I> of these policies;
<P>
c) devising and proposing <I>alternative</I> policies:
<P>
at institutional level, through lobbying
<P>
at public opinion level, by involving and enlisting the media
<P>
The first step is therefore to create a forum where these protagonists
can meet, work together and gradually extend their network, free
from institutional constraints.  This would pave the way for concerted
and co-ordinated activities and could provide a collecting point
for data gathered at grassroots level, which might supplement
information collected by institutional bodies and shed more light
on it.  This will give such a body the legitimacy it needs to
become a real partner for national and international decision-makers
and thus influence the framing of policies themselves.<HR>

<H3>Role of the United Nations</H3>

<P>
Since its creation in 1945, the UN (the United Nations Organisation),
has developed actions aimed at promoting the respect of human
rights in the world.  The negotiation of international treaties,
the approval of numerous political declarations and the recent
initiatives to avoid or stop wars and other armed conflicts which
are affecting world peace all bear witness to the enormous efforts
made by this international organisation throughout the world.
<P>
Furthermore, the UN has established an entire structure of agencies
and bodies responsible for human rights and other objectives contained
in the San Francisco Charter.  Among the six committees which
comprise it, there is one concerned with human rights and one
concerned with drugs.  In addition, organisations like UNESCO
(United Nations Organisation for Education, Science and Culture),
UNDP (United Nations Development Programme), WHO (World Health
Organisation) and HCR (Office of the United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees) have certain responsibilities for trying to solve
various specific types of problem facing humanity.
<P>
Nevertheless, in 1945, the UN also inherited a further task from
its predecessor, the League of Nations: control of the growing,
trafficking and consumption of illicit drugs.  For this purpose,
it has created the Commission on Narcotic Drugs, the Financial
Action Task Force on Money Laundering (GAFI), while the WHO takes
action in the fields of prevention and prohibition on the world
scale.
<P>
Thus, the UN drew up a list of 107 psychotropic substances (among
them the coca leaf, from which human industry extracts the alkaloid
of cocaine).  UNO also ratified three treaties of universal scope
(1961, 1971 and 1988) establishing a world legal structure for
the fight against drug trafficking.  Lastly, UNO has various mechanisms
which should now be evaluated from the standpoint of rationality
and effectiveness in relation to the principles which govern a
state under the rule of law and the international system of human
rights, at least as regards actual practice.
<P>
I refer here to the application of extradition, (in Bolivia, there
have been examples of simple kidnappings), surveillance of deliveries,
aerial spraying with herbicides of dubious quality, the detention
of consumers, the creation of many offences, special and emergency
laws and procedures (this was the case in Peru between 1978 and
1991, and is still the case in Bolivia with the unconstitutional
law 1008, and the Statute against drugs in Colombia).
<H3>Conflicts between human rights and the fight against drug
trafficking</H3>

<P>
The prisons are full, in both rich and poor countries, of not
yet sentenced and hence formally innocent people arrested for
drug-related offences (but, despite this, these prisons have become
supply centres for legal and illegal drugs).  A single example
suffices: in the United States in 1994, of the 82,127 prisoners
held for federal offences, 50,394 (or 59,4%) were in prison for
offences connected with drug trafficking or consumption.
<P>
However, the big drug barons who have colossal fortunes have several
alternatives when faced with prison: repentance, submission, collaboration
with the police.  Lastly, the very widespread corruption among
the police, the judiciary and the prisons constitutes a final
way - and frequently indeed the first - to obtain illegal release
and freedom.
<P>
Democracy in the countries in which drugs are produced or through
which they transit has been, and still is being, weakened.  The
military in my country are in political and military control -
under a state of emergency - of the majority of the producer regions
where some 200.000 hectares are under coca.  It is here that there
are the most serious cases of corruption and the management of
dirty money to permit drugs to be exported.  To combat this situation,
Fujimori's democratic government has decided that all drug trafficking
offences committed by the military should be judged by military
law and not by the judiciary.
<P>
Elsewhere, corruption and the infiltration of the money and influence
of traffickers' organisations have ended up corrupting various
civil authorities, at the highest levels, and affecting electoral
processes at all levels.  Mexico and Colombia are clear examples
of this.
<P>
Curiously enough, other processes at work in this &quot;global
village&quot; of ours are having a negative effect on anti-drug
efforts.  The globalisation of economic relations, the financial
stabilisation of certain countries of the South and the opening
of world markets constitute the three biggest successes of the
world economic community in recent years.  However, these successes
have brought about a situation in which the production of drugs
has become the only means of economic survival for millions of
small farmers on the Rif, in the mountains of Thailand and in
the Andes.  In this connection, we draw attention to the fundamental
contradictions between the policy of openness in the South, the
maintenance of strict protectionist measures in the OECD economies,
and the subordination to drug trafficking of broad social, economic
and financial sectors.
<P>
Subordination (others call it addiction) to the consumption of
drugs has not changed one iota.  The producers of coca and poppies
in the Andes are increasing at the same rate as the queues of
unemployed and redundant workers.  This situation is the consequence
of the structural adjustment programmes and reforms of the State,
notably in Peru and Bolivia.
<P>
On the other hand, the bands of traffickers find their illegal
trade facilitated by the opening of international markets, the
consolidation of trading blocs between drug producing countries
(Andean group), transit countries (MERCOSUR) and consumer countries
(NAFTA and the European Union), and by the increased flows of
goods and persons.  Lastly, young consumers find no answer to
the serious disintegration of the family, and seek escape in drugs
as their only response, despite the enormous amounts of money
involved.
<P>
The anti-drug actions frequently carried out in many countries
end up directly affecting the human rights situation in the countries
concerned: frequent arbitrary imprisonment, essentially of mere
consumers who are classified as traffickers; compulsory uprooting
of plants with no micro- or macro-economic alternative available;
indiscriminate spraying which has a serious impact on biodiversity
in Amazonia and on legal crops (Guaviare, in Colombia); violent
police raids as in Bolivia (Chapare, in the Cochabamba region).
 All this to be able to achieve the objectives set in agreement
with the United States and to go on receiving the &quot;collaboration&quot;
of this country and its support for any request for credits from
the IMF (International Monetary Fund) and the World Bank.
<P>
The theory according to which there is only one way to approach
the problem of the supply, trafficking and consumption of illegal
drugs - formal prohibition and rhetoric - has proved a resounding
failure over recent decades.
<P>
At the same time, such efforts have seriously affected democratic
processes in certain countries of the South, and have restricted
in them the possibilities for the effective enforcement of human
rights as recognised in the Charter of the United Nations itself
and in the Universal Conventions.
<P>
At the individual level, i.e. concerning civil and political rights,
various obstacles have arisen, such as the states of emergency
declared in regions where coca and poppies are cultivated (Huallaga,
Guaviare and Chapare valleys).
<P>
Second, there are problems resulting from the application of arbitrary
and unjust legislation, such as the special laws in Colombia and
Bolivia: carte blanche, trials which violate the basic principles
of the rule of law, and harsh if not arbitrary sentences such
as life imprisonment in Peru or the death penalty in Asian countries.
<P>
As regards the implementation of economic, social and cultural
rights, anti-drugs policies not only constitute an obstacle -
together with structural adjustment, stabilisation and financial
rehabilitation policies - but also work against the possibilities
for sustainable development as proposed by the international community
at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, and at the meeting
on Social Development in Copenhagen in 1994.
<P>
Collective rights are also weakened by the application of the
anti-drug actions, because the illegal drugs economy becomes a
way of escaping from poverty.  The results of these actions hit
the weakest links in the drug chain; the law is applied against
producers, and the economic losses shift towards the centres of
production and consumption.
<P>
For these reasons it is essential to redefine world objectives
and policies in such a way that the standpoint of the South is
given more weight than it has received in the past.  It is essential
not to dissociate the problem of drugs and trafficking from the
problems of poverty, North-South international trade in agricultural
products and the protection of the Andean and Amazonian environments.

<H3>Contribution by Ricardo VARGAS - Colombia</H3>

<H3>Consequences of repressive anti-drug policies and relationship
between drugs and human rights</H3>

<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P>
The strengthening of the prohibition as a basis for approaches
and decisions in the battle against drugs is directly and indirectly
affecting human rights in those countries with illegal drug economies.
This situation is experienced differently at the three levels
of the drug economy: production, distribution and consumption
of narcotics.
<P>
At the production level the effects are closely related to the
presence of illegal crops, grown in a context of crisis-ridden
rural economies, of occupation of farm land belonging to the indian
communities, and generally in those areas of the farming sector
worst hit by the globalisation of the economy. Illegal crops have
become the primary alternative solution for defending the jobs
and incomes of peasant families, and the principal means of access
to goods and services such as health care and education, as well
as non-essential consumer items.
<P>
Government decisions to destroy the crops, and the producers'
response to such decisions are resulting in a tendency towards
the militarisation of the zones concerned, under the control of
armed guerillas, with little state presence. The result is a complex
conflict in which producers are caught up in a war, in the name
of the battle against drugs and subversive activities, that is
having unforeseen effects in terms of human rights and the violation
of international humanitarian law.
<P>
Furthermore, in its fight against drug trafficking, the Colombian
Government has decreed a series of measures under cover of the
State of Emergency, legislative measures that affect many aspects
of everyday life and make for a &quot;faceless&quot; justice system
that undermines legal guarantees and citizens' right to due process.
The state is also guilty of serious human rights violations that
it conceals by laying the blame on drug trafficking, thereby prolonging
its time-old impunity in such matters.
<P>
Finally, in connection with the consumption of illegal substances,
the Government is attempting, through legislative reform, to undo
the progress made by the Constitutional Court when it declared
certain provisions in the Narcotics Bill unconstitutional because
they denied rights to people who chose to consume drugs. The reform
would criminalise drug consumption again, which would only further
marginalise groups with problems of drug addiction.
<H3>Institutional policies and agreements at the national, regional
and international level and their impact in Colombia</H3>

<P>
While Colombia's anti-drug policy is based on prohibition, it
is strongly influenced by the pressure periodically brought to
bear by the Unites States. The imposition of a bilateral agenda
demanding anti-drug actions to keep Washington happy actually
results in a total lack of co-operation between the two countries,
with Washington trying to call the cards unilaterally.
<P>
This is a violation of Colombia's national sovereignty, preventing
it from handling the problem in its own way. It is apparent in
the lack of participation of civil society in decisions on drug
issues. The state has monopolised the decision-making process,
and any attempts at independent action have been in vain.
<P>
At the production level, overtures were made by the communities
concerned, but their offer to phase the crops out gradually were
ignored in favour of the total crop destruction policy imposed
by the United States, turning production areas virtually into
war zones. 
<P>
At the distribution level, Colombia has suggested subjecting dealers
to Colombian law, but this offer lacked credibility in the eyes
of Washington, and the threat that extradition or other means
of detaining and trying drug bosses in the United States will
be reintroduced is taken very seriously.
<P>
Finally, at the drug consumption level, a decision of the Constitutional
Court decriminalised possession of small doses of narcotics for
personal consumption, but Washington rejected this decision, leading
to pressure in Colombia to return to the old prohibitionist regime
under which consumption was considered as a criminal offence.
<P>
Colombia, therefore, has lost its sovereignty in the field of
anti-drug policy; decisions are taken on the basis of international
pressure, which is all the heavier today as the President's credibility
wanes in the light of his alleged dealings with the drug barons.
<P>
This state of affairs is affecting criminal law policy with regard
to traffickers, with legislation bowing to the whims of external
pressure for the sake of an international image in keeping with
the prohibitionist approach. It is also obstructing Alternative
Development policies, since repression prevails over consultation
with the communities concerned, and drug users' rights are violated
by exposing them to criminal prosecution.
<H3>Recommendations on alternative policies and actions</H3>

<P>
1. The Colombian Government must stop treating producers (peasants,
settlers, indians) as criminals. It must help them strengthen
their organisations, and make room for dialogue, so that environment-friendly
regional development solutions may be proposed and further violence
avoided.
<P>
2. The Colombian Government must not confuse the armed conflict
in the country with the drug problem. It must develop separate
policies on these two issues, while bearing in mind that certain
problems are common to both, and that dialogue and negotiations
should also be encouraged to produce a peaceful solution to the
internal conflict.
<P>
3. The U.S. Government must accept that there are socio-economic,
cultural and political problems in the production zones which
are incompatible with the pressure it is exerting on Colombia
to destroy all the illegal crops indiscriminately. Solutions must
be found to the basic problems facing populations in the production
areas, and to the environmental aspects of the question.
<P>
4. The international community must strengthen the Alternative
Development solutions and urge the Colombian Government to make
room for participation by the local communities through their
organisations, and to assume its responsibilities concerning the
protection of the environment.
<P>
5. The U.S. Government must respect Colombia's sovereignty and
stop interfering in its internal affairs by pressing for the militarisation
of the battle against drugs and for the reintroduction of extradition,
which will merely prolong the violence. The legal economy in Colombia
is already under threat from the certification system, and this
further jeopardises the chances of promoting viable alternatives
to illegal crop production.
<P>
6. The international community must strive to strengthen the Colombian
justice system in respect of fundamental rights, due process and
the elimination of all extra-judicial measures that constitute
a threat to human life or personal freedom.
<P>
7. The international community must encourage serious and impartial
analysis of the drug issue, in order to propose solutions other
than prohibition and the resulting repression among citizens caught
up in the drug problem in one way or another.
<P>
8. The Colombian Government must respect the decision of the Constitutional
Court concerning the decriminalisation of personal consumption,
and develop and strengthen its drug abuse prevention and treatment
policies.
<P>
Alternatives and proposals concerning the impact of the anti-drug
measures
<P>
The alternatives are directly related to social factors at each
level of the illegal economy. At the production level, more value
should be attached to the role of the local peasant and indian
communities, with machinery for consultation with the Government
in the context of a regional development dynamic.
<P>
At the distribution level, solutions may lie in legalisation and
in the country's own, sovereign criminal law system, developed
to cater for the nation's interests in a context of joint responsibility,
reciprocity and interdependence at the international level. A
special regime should consequently be developed for this type
of offence, based on respect for each country's internal decisions
and independently of other, unrelated issues on the international
agenda.
<P>
At the consumption level, what Colombia needs is the decriminalisation
of personal consumption, a liberal victory that would encourage
preventive measures and treatments based on individual self-determination,
and above all an alternative to the present atmosphere of criminality
and social stigma that merely exacerbates the social exclusion
of drug users.
<P>
All these proposals mean making provision for full participation
by the communities concerned, who have thus far been excluded
from the decision-making process, which has been monopolised by
the Government, under considerable pressure from external influences
and in particular from U.S. interference in Colombia's domestic
affairs.
<P>
Hence the need for international fora where the social aspects
of the drug issue can be discussed impartially, without interference
from political interests in the countries concerned. This would
help Colombia to improve its public image at home.
<P>
Furthermore, there is a serious lack of information in Colombia
concerning alternatives to prohibition currently being developed
and tested at the international level, and exchanges of experiences
at various levels, a lack of information that merely serves to
strengthen the position of those who deny the need for serious
reflection on the subject.<HR>

<H3>Contribution by Ricardo SOBER&Oacute;N GARRIDO - Peru</H3>

<H3>Role of the United Nations</H3>

<P>
Since its creation in 1945, the UN (the United Nations Organisation),
has developed actions aimed at promoting the respect of human
rights in the world.  The negotiation of international treaties,
the approval of numerous political declarations and the recent
initiatives to avoid or stop wars and other armed conflicts which
are affecting world peace all bear witness to the enormous efforts
made by this international organisation throughout the world.
<P>
Furthermore, the UN has established an entire structure of agencies
and bodies responsible for human rights and other objectives contained
in the San Francisco Charter.  Among the six committees which
comprise it, there is one concerned with human rights and one
concerned with drugs.  In addition, organisations like UNESCO
(United Nations Organisation for Education, Science and Culture),
UNDP (United Nations Development Programme), WHO (World Health
Organisation) and HCR (Office of the United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees) have certain responsibilities for trying to solve
various specific types of problem facing humanity.
<P>
Nevertheless, in 1945, the UN also inherited a further task from
its predecessor, the League of Nations: control of the growing,
trafficking and consumption of illicit drugs.  For this purpose,
it has created the Commission on Narcotic Drugs, the Financial
Action Task Force on Money Laundering (GAFI), while the WHO takes
action in the fields of prevention and prohibition on the world
scale.
<P>
Thus, the UN drew up a list of 107 psychotropic substances (among
them the coca leaf, from which human industry extracts the alkaloid
of cocaine).  UNO also ratified three treaties of universal scope
(1961, 1971 and 1988) establishing a world legal structure for
the fight against drug trafficking.  Lastly, UNO has various mechanisms
which should now be evaluated from the standpoint of rationality
and effectiveness in relation to the principles which govern a
state under the rule of law and the international system of human
rights, at least as regards actual practice.
<P>
I refer here to the application of extradition, (in Bolivia, there
have been examples of simple kidnappings), surveillance of deliveries,
aerial spraying with herbicides of dubious quality, the detention
of consumers, the creation of many offences, special and emergency
laws and procedures (this was the case in Peru between 1978 and
1991, and is still the case in Bolivia with the unconstitutional
law 1008, and the Statute against drugs in Colombia).
<H3>Conflicts between human rights and the fight against drug
trafficking</H3>

<P>
The prisons are full, in both rich and poor countries, of not
yet sentenced and hence formally innocent people arrested for
drug-related offences (but, despite this, these prisons have become
supply centres for legal and illegal drugs).  A single example
suffices: in the United States in 1994, of the 82,127 prisoners
held for federal offences, 50,394 (or 59,4%) were in prison for
offences connected with drug trafficking or consumption.
<P>
However, the big drug barons who have colossal fortunes have several
alternatives when faced with prison: repentance, submission, collaboration
with the police.  Lastly, the very widespread corruption among
the police, the judiciary and the prisons constitutes a final
way - and frequently indeed the first - to obtain illegal release
and freedom.
<P>
Democracy in the countries in which drugs are produced or through
which they transit has been, and still is being, weakened.  The
military in my country are in political and military control -
under a state of emergency - of the majority of the producer regions
where some 200.000 hectares are under coca.  It is here that there
are the most serious cases of corruption and the management of
dirty money to permit drugs to be exported.  To combat this situation,
Fujimori's democratic government has decided that all drug trafficking
offences committed by the military should be judged by military
law and not by the judiciary.
<P>
Elsewhere, corruption and the infiltration of the money and influence
of traffickers' organisations have ended up corrupting various
civil authorities, at the highest levels, and affecting electoral
processes at all levels.  Mexico and Colombia are clear examples
of this.
<P>
Curiously enough, other processes at work in this &quot;global
village&quot; of ours are having a negative effect on anti-drug
efforts.  The globalisation of economic relations, the financial
stabilisation of certain countries of the South and the opening
of world markets constitute the three biggest successes of the
world economic community in recent years.  However, these successes
have brought about a situation in which the production of drugs
has become the only means of economic survival for millions of
small farmers on the Rif, in the mountains of Thailand and in
the Andes.  In this connection, we draw attention to the fundamental
contradictions between the policy of openness in the South, the
maintenance of strict protectionist measures in the OECD economies,
and the subordination to drug trafficking of broad social, economic
and financial sectors.
<P>
Subordination (others call it addiction) to the consumption of
drugs has not changed one iota.  The producers of coca and poppies
in the Andes are increasing at the same rate as the queues of
unemployed and redundant workers.  This situation is the consequence
of the structural adjustment programmes and reforms of the State,
notably in Peru and Bolivia.
<P>
On the other hand, the bands of traffickers find their illegal
trade facilitated by the opening of international markets, the
consolidation of trading blocs between drug producing countries
(Andean group), transit countries (MERCOSUR) and consumer countries
(NAFTA and the European Union), and by the increased flows of
goods and persons.  Lastly, young consumers find no answer to
the serious disintegration of the family, and seek escape in drugs
as their only response, despite the enormous amounts of money
involved.
<P>
The anti-drug actions frequently carried out in many countries
end up directly affecting the human rights situation in the countries
concerned: frequent arbitrary imprisonment, essentially of mere
consumers who are classified as traffickers; compulsory uprooting
of plants with no micro- or macro-economic alternative available;
indiscriminate spraying which has a serious impact on biodiversity
in Amazonia and on legal crops (Guaviare, in Colombia); violent
police raids as in Bolivia (Chapare, in the Cochabamba region).
 All this to be able to achieve the objectives set in agreement
with the United States and to go on receiving the &quot;collaboration&quot;
of this country and its support for any request for credits from
the IMF (International Monetary Fund) and the World Bank.
<P>
The theory according to which there is only one way to approach
the problem of the supply, trafficking and consumption of illegal
drugs - formal prohibition and rhetoric - has proved a resounding
failure over recent decades.
<P>
At the same time, such efforts have seriously affected democratic
processes in certain countries of the South, and have restricted
in them the possibilities for the effective enforcement of human
rights as recognised in the Charter of the United Nations itself
and in the Universal Conventions.
<P>
At the individual level, i.e. concerning civil and political rights,
various obstacles have arisen, such as the states of emergency
declared in regions where coca and poppies are cultivated (Huallaga,
Guaviare and Chapare valleys).
<P>
Second, there are problems resulting from the application of arbitrary
and unjust legislation, such as the special laws in Colombia and
Bolivia: carte blanche, trials which violate the basic principles
of the rule of law, and harsh if not arbitrary sentences such
as life imprisonment in Peru or the death penalty in Asian countries.
<P>
As regards the implementation of economic, social and cultural
rights, anti-drugs policies not only constitute an obstacle -
together with structural adjustment, stabilisation and financial
rehabilitation policies - but also work against the possibilities
for sustainable development as proposed by the international community
at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, and at the meeting
on Social Development in Copenhagen in 1994.
<P>
Collective rights are also weakened by the application of the
anti-drug actions, because the illegal drugs economy becomes a
way of escaping from poverty.  The results of these actions hit
the weakest links in the drug chain; the law is applied against
producers, and the economic losses shift towards the centres of
production and consumption.
<P>
For these reasons it is essential to redefine world objectives
and policies in such a way that the standpoint of the South is
given more weight than it has received in the past.  It is essential
not to dissociate the problem of drugs and trafficking from the
problems of poverty, North-South international trade in agricultural
products and the protection of the Andean and Amazonian environments.

</H3>

<H3>Consequences of repressive anti-drug policies and relationship
between drugs and human rights</H3>

<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P>
The strengthening of the prohibition as a basis for approaches
and decisions in the battle against drugs is directly and indirectly
affecting human rights in those countries with illegal drug economies.
This situation is experienced differently at the three levels
of the drug economy: production, distribution and consumption
of narcotics.
<P>
At the production level the effects are closely related to the
presence of illegal crops, grown in a context of crisis-ridden
rural economies, of occupation of farm land belonging to the indian
communities, and generally in those areas of the farming sector
worst hit by the globalisation of the economy. Illegal crops have
become the primary alternative solution for defending the jobs
and incomes of peasant families, and the principal means of access
to goods and services such as health care and education, as well
as non-essential consumer items.
<P>
Government decisions to destroy the crops, and the producers'
response to such decisions are resulting in a tendency towards
the militarisation of the zones concerned, under the control of
armed guerillas, with little state presence. The result is a complex
conflict in which producers are caught up in a war, in the name
of the battle against drugs and subversive activities, that is
having unforeseen effects in terms of human rights and the violation
of international humanitarian law.
<P>
Furthermore, in its fight against drug trafficking, the Colombian
Government has decreed a series of measures under cover of the
State of Emergency, legislative measures that affect many aspects
of everyday life and make for a &quot;faceless&quot; justice system
that undermines legal guarantees and citizens' right to due process.
The state is also guilty of serious human rights violations that
it conceals by laying the blame on drug trafficking, thereby prolonging
its time-old impunity in such matters.
<P>
Finally, in connection with the consumption of illegal substances,
the Government is attempting, through legislative reform, to undo
the progress made by the Constitutional Court when it declared
certain provisions in the Narcotics Bill unconstitutional because
they denied rights to people who chose to consume drugs. The reform
would criminalise drug consumption again, which would only further
marginalise groups with problems of drug addiction.
<H3>Institutional policies and agreements at the national, regional
and international level and their impact in Colombia</H3>

<P>
While Colombia's anti-drug policy is based on prohibition, it
is strongly influenced by the pressure periodically brought to
bear by the Unites States. The imposition of a bilateral agenda
demanding anti-drug actions to keep Washington happy actually
results in a total lack of co-operation between the two countries,
with Washington trying to call the cards unilaterally.
<P>
This is a violation of Colombia's national sovereignty, preventing
it from handling the problem in its own way. It is apparent in
the lack of participation of civil society in decisions on drug
issues. The state has monopolised the decision-making process,
and any attempts at independent action have been in vain.
<P>
At the production level, overtures were made by the communities
concerned, but their offer to phase the crops out gradually were
ignored in favour of the total crop destruction policy imposed
by the United States, turning production areas virtually into
war zones. 
<P>
At the distribution level, Colombia has suggested subjecting dealers
to Colombian law, but this offer lacked credibility in the eyes
of Washington, and the threat that extradition or other means
of detaining and trying drug bosses in the United States will
be reintroduced is taken very seriously.
<P>
Finally, at the drug consumption level, a decision of the Constitutional
Court decriminalised possession of small doses of narcotics for
personal consumption, but Washington rejected this decision, leading
to pressure in Colombia to return to the old prohibitionist regime
under which consumption was considered as a criminal offence.
<P>
Colombia, therefore, has lost its sovereignty in the field of
anti-drug policy; decisions are taken on the basis of international
pressure, which is all the heavier today as the President's credibility
wanes in the light of his alleged dealings with the drug barons.
<P>
This state of affairs is affecting criminal law policy with regard
to traffickers, with legislation bowing to the whims of external
pressure for the sake of an international image in keeping with
the prohibitionist approach. It is also obstructing Alternative
Development policies, since repression prevails over consultation
with the communities concerned, and drug users' rights are violated
by exposing them to criminal prosecution.
