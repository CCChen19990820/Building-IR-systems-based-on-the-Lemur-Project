<B>GOALS AND OBJECTIVES OF STUDY</B><P>

The goals of this study are to quantify materials used for the
manufacture of proteins and peptides, and to forecast changes to
l995. The objective is to elucidate the impact of biotechnology,
and other important influences, on the supply of materials.<P>

<B>REASONS FOR STUDY</B><P>

The first phase of the biotechnology revolution focuses on the
manipulation of genes, the second on the manufacture of proteins
and peptides. As the biotechnology revolution progresses, an
increasing number of proteins and peptides will be produced, and
the ways of manufacture will also shift. These changes bring with
them new, and different, demands for manufacturing materials.
Proteins and peptides already are big business, even without
biotechnology, and the ways even they are manufactured are being
touched.<P>

<B>CONTRIBUTION OF STUDY</B><P>

Most studies of this type focus on new proteins and peptides coming
out of the biotechnology revolution, but ignore all the other
proteins and peptides already on the market. They also tend to
ignore the implications of new developments on post-genetic aspects
and the materials of manufacture. This study, on the other hand,
takes an integrated approach, and examines the entire field of
proteins and peptides, with emphasis on their methods of
manufacture and their materials requirements.<P>

<B>AUDIENCE FOR REPORT</B><P>

Readers of this report are expected to have interests in business
aspects of science and technology. They may have titles such as
product managers, sales managers, marketing managers, strategic
planners, business development  managers, financial investors, and
the like. Scientific and technological developments are interpreted
for their significance to business interests. The report serves
both protein/peptide manufacturers and materials suppliers.<P>

<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

The report divides into cohesive units for ready access. After the
INTRODUCTION and SUMMARY, the report opens with an OVERVIEW OF
PROTEINS AND THEIR  MANUFACTURE  & SUPPLY to place the topic into
context. Next, the section on PROTEIN/PEPTIDE MANUFACTURING
TECHNOLOGIES goes into depth regarding process descriptions,
applications of the technologies, materials requirements and major
materials suppliers in each manufacturing category. The third
section presents the MATERIALS INDUSTRY STRUCTURE, explaining the
organizational supply of materials for proteins and peptides. A
special addendum is a discussion of important strategies for
staying competitive in the 1990s. Section four analyzes MARKETS FOR
MANUFACTURING MATERIALS BY MATERIALS TYPES, and section five
analyzes MARKETS FOR MANUFACTURING MATERIALS BY PROTEIN
APPLICATIONS. These two sections break down materials consumption
comprehensively. The next three sections provide information on
GOVERNMENT REGULATION, INTERNATIONAL ASPECTS and a selection of
COMPANY PROFILES. The report ends with six APPENDICES, including a
DIRECTORY of MATERIALS SUPPLIERS.<P>

Since this report's emphasis is on manufacture and materials, this
study has only brief discussions of the end markets and sales of
proteins and peptides.<P>

<B>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

For accounting purposes, this report uses the biochemical
definition of proteins and peptides, which is in conformance with
the definition used by the Protein Data Bank. We exclude polyamides
in the plastics sense and we exclude penicillins. Proteins and
peptides generally refer to refined, or semi-refined, identifiable
substances; we exclude whole cells and complex mixtures such as
muscle, and we exclude "active principles" recognizable merely as
chromatogram spots. This study pays most attention to the initial
generation of proteins and peptides in the raw, bulk production
sense. Post-production operations are accounted for separately.<P>

This study uses a harmonized system of accounting. Materials for
proteins that may fit more than one protein category are accounted
for in one place only; thus, for example, a protein or peptide that
could fit the blood protein or peptide hormone category is
accounted for only once. This system ensures the avoidance of
double-counting errors. Readers, for their own particular
interests, may wish to assemble and tailor data from this report
to suit their own needs.<P>

Materials consumption is presented in terms of combined sales and
captive use. Quantities are expressed in pounds (lbs.) and
kilograms (kg), and liquid materials are converted to a weight
basis through density considerations. Values are in U.S. currency,
expressed in millions of dollars, where $1 million equals $1 MM
equals $1 x 106. A billion is 109.<P>

All analyses are made independently and objectively, without any
biases of vested interest. Mention of companies and products are
not endorsements; omissions if any are not intentional.<P>


<B>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

Direct sources of information came from telephone interviews with
over forty individuals representing protein manufacturers and
materials suppliers. We also obtained copious company and product
literature, from both here and abroad. In addition, we examined the
scientific and patent literature. In some instances data were
obtained from those we interviewed. In other instances we made
informed estimates. Where we made calculations, we explain what  we
did and give our assumptions.<P>

<B>CREDENTIALS AND RELATED WORK</B><P>

The analyst for this study is a biochemist, formally educated in
protein chemistry, having both academic and industrial experience
in the field. He also holds an MBA in marketing and has been
writing studies for BCC for many years. Among the published studies

</CENTER>

<B>OBJECTIVES AND GOALS OF STUDY
</B><P>
The objectives of this study are to:  (1) Relate how foods are
analyzed for  components and  contaminants; (2)  Elucidate the
forces for  change in  food testing  and  the  application  of
reagents; (3)  Estimate current  U.S. sales  of  food  testing
reagents and  forecast their  sales to 1997.  The goals are to
provide meaningful  information, data, and analysis to help in
strategic, marketing, and product planning.<P>


<B>REASONS FOR STUDY AND ITS CONTRIBUTION</B><P>

Recent proposed  changes in  food labeling regulations promise
to reshape  food testing  and influence  reagent sales.   Even
without  their   implementation,  however,   food  testing  is
undergoing  significant   changes  as   a  result   of   other
regulations, consumer pressures for increased food safety, and
new testing  technologies.   Although the  overall market  for
food testing reagents will likely grow in the near future, the
shares held  by the  various types  of  testing  reagents  are
likely to change and shift, dramatically in some instances.<P>

As a  consequence of  the changing  scene,  it  is  critically
important to  grasp the  ramifications of  the complex market,
regulatory, and  technological forces  on the  sales  of  food
testing reagents.  BCC's contribution is to shed light on this
topic and  quantify the  changes  with  independent,  unbiased
analysis.<P>


<B>AUDIENCE</B><P>

This study  is written  expressly for  business  managers  and
executives, both in testing product supply and testing product
use.<P>


<B>SCOPE AND CONTENT OF STUDY</B><P>

See Table  of Contents.   This  study is about analytical food
testing, which  concerns the  detection,  identification,  and
quantification of  substances in  foods.   Emphasis is  on the
applications and sales of reagents for food testing.<P>

This study  is not  about analytical  reagents or  reagents in
general.   This  study  also  excludes  reagents  for  on-farm
agricultural testing  or environmental  analysis.   This study
excludes analytical  instrumentation except to a minor extent,
and then  only qualitatively  for the impact on reagent sales.<P>

This study  is not  about food  toxicology, food  manufacture,
food markets,  or the  remediation of  food  safety  problems.
Also excluded  are human health and medical aspects, except in
relation to food testing concerns.<P>


<B>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

This study  defines foods  as products for nutritive ingestion
by eating and drinking, and conceptually includes products for
both  humans   and  animals.    Food  testing  is  defined  as
analytical tests  for food  components and  food contaminants,
and analytical reagents for food testing as chemistry-based or
biology-based products  for the detection, identification, and
quantitation of substances in foods.<P>

Excluded from this study are pharmaceutical nutriments such as
parenteral vitamins  and  amino  acids,  vitamin  and  mineral
pills, and  drinking water  from tap.    The  emphasis  is  on
processed and  "manufactured" foods and beverages, but certain
aspects of  on-the-farm  agricultural  testing  are  included.
This study  also excludes  food toxicology  testing, taste and
consumer preference  testing, and  physical properties testing
such as texture, mouthfeel, and other such testing.<P>

Primary  sources   of  information  and  data  were  telephone
interviews with representatives of testing reagent, suppliers,
testing reagent  users, and others expert and knowledgeable in
the field  of food  testing.  Secondary sources of information
and data included company product literature, general business
literature,  scientific  literature,  government  studies  and
reports,  various   reference  texts,   and   numerous   trade
publications.<P>

All discussion  and analysis refers to the U.S. only,
unless specifically  indicated otherwise.  We estimate current
sales for  1992, and  forecast sales  to 1997 in constant 1992
dollars to  reflect  real  changes  without  inflation.  Sales
figures are  in millions  of dollars,  where  $1  MM  is  $One
million, which is $106.  The average annual growth rate, AAGR,
is derived  by the compounding method using standard tables of
net present  value.   Sales are  estimated for the supplier to
user transaction, and may not necessarily reflect manufacturer
level.<P>

All information,  analysis, and  assessment are  gathered  and
made independently,  and  without  bias  or  vested  interest.
Omissions of  companies or  products are  not intentional, and
mentions are not endorsements.<P>

</CENTER>

<B>OBJECTIVE AND PURPOSE OF REPORT</B><P>

Human toxicity testing and environmental effects testing, the two
components of biohazard testing, play pivotal roles in industry and
commerce, since they contribute to and often initiate standards,
regulations, market approvals, remediations, controls and materials
substitutions. Calling a chemical toxic has major implications and
consequences, and a lot of decisions from various quarters hinge on
whether biohazard tests are done, and the way they are conducted.<P>

Obviously, if it kills, it's toxic.  But the tests today are more
complicated and are becoming increasingly more subtle.  Tests for
lethality, in fact, are no longer the way to judge most forms of
toxicity.  Moreover, new types of toxicity have become recognized
and added to the battery of tests that must now be considered.<P>

Biohazard testing has become a hot-button, emotional issue as a
result of antichemical attitudes, animal rights activism and
environmental protectionism.  The field is undergoing a period of
change and transition, making its future perhaps difficult to grasp
in all its various dimensions.  Yet, the demands for biohazard
testing increase, even while voices, sometimes strident, call for
radical changes in the way they are carried out.<P>

An unfortunate outcome of the controversies now aroused by
biohazard testing is that a cloud of secrecy is descending on the
subject, making it difficult to discuss it objectively from a
business standpoint.  But this is precisely what the subject needs,
so that executive managers and others in authority can effectively
deal with events and implement the future.  The objective of this
report, therefore, is to shed light on the changing dimensions of
biohazard testing from a technical-business standpoint and examine
its evolving roles.  The purpose is to help readers with business
concerns understand developments from their perspective so they can
manage more effectively.<P>

This report raises the following questions about biohazard testing,
and then seeks answers to them:<P>

     What types of tests are involved in biohazard testing?  How
are they done?<P>

    Who does biohazard testing?  Where are they done, in-house or
by outside contracting?<P>

    How big is the field of biohazard testing, in terms of animal
supply?  What are the markets for animal alternatives?<P>

    What are the newly emerging in vitro testing products?  Where
are their niche opportunities even as the validation process
proceeds?  Who is entering this field?<P>

    What is the business status of envirotoxicity testing?  Who is
in it?  What are the fauna and flora requirements for this kind of
testing?<P>

<B>SCOPE AND CONTENT</B><P>

This study addresses the business of toxicology, covering health
effects on humans and the effects of chemicals on the fauna and
flora of the environment.  It includes discussion and accounting of
conventional animal tests, in vitro tests and envirotoxicity tests.<P>

Readers of this report are expected to be business managers and
those with business interests.  Though the report takes up
toxicological science, the writing is geared to be readable by
those having a nontechnical background, while maintaining
scientific soundness for those who do have a science background.<P>

Topics not taken up in this report are:  The use of laboratory
animals in nontoxicological applications; the chemical or
microbiological analysis, diagnosis or monitoring of substances
already known to be toxic; remediation and control of toxic or
hazardous materials; and chemical hazards unrelated to toxicity,
i.e. flammability, explosiveness, causticity and corrosiveness.
Also, this is not a science textbook on toxicology, but a business
analysis of the subject.<P>

Section I provides an overview of the NATURE OF BIOHAZARD.  It
defines biohazard, and places biohazard in the context of other
types of hazard and in the context of fields related to and
differentiated from biohazard testing.  Newcomers to the subject
will find this basic grounding useful, and those already acquainted
may find fresh insights.<P>

Section II is on the BUSINESS, MARKETS AND DYNAMICS of biohazard
testing.  This section gives insight as to how biohazard testing
"works" from the business standpoint.  It includes a brief history
to explain why biohazard testing has come to play a pivotal role,
illuminates the forces influencing biohazard testing including the
subtle interplays, and extensively discusses regulations as the key
driver of biohazard testing.  The lengthy discussion on the
business climate for biohazard testing illuminates the major forces
shaping the future development of this field.  Then, this section
analyzes the market for biohazard testing, examining it in many
ways to bring out various features.  Finally, this section
discusses BCC's forecasting scenario, the analysis and thinking
that went into our projections.  This piece gives our critical
assumptions and the reasoning behind them, as devoid of biases as
any independent observer with no vested interests can be.<P>

Section III presents the INDUSTRY STRUCTURE.  It describes the
elementary components of the biohazard testing industry and makes
clear their roles and interactions.  Included are chemical
manufacturers and suppliers, testing product suppliers, testing
service providers, and research centers including universities and
government laboratories.  Our profiles of selected establishments
were selected as leading examples of their types of organizations.<P>

Section IV covers APPLICATIONS OF BIOHAZARD TESTING.  Testing
requirements, needs and desires are described, volumes of testing
are analyzed and major trends and directions affecting testing are
discussed.  Emphasized are pharmaceuticals, foods, cosmetics and
toiletries, and pesticides.  Also covered are medical device
materials, biocompatible plastics, organic solvents, smoke and
biotechnology.<P>

Section V extensively discusses CONVENTIONAL ANIMAL TESTING,
emphasizing the business aspects rather than the science of
toxicology.  BCC discusses laboratory animals and derives estimates
for the number and value of mammalian animals used in biohazard
testing and associated research.  Then we describe the various
types of toxicology tests and discuss the changes and developments
taking place regarding their use.<P>

Section VI is about IN VITRO TESTING.  Often touted as substitutes
or alternatives to tests with live animals, in vitro testing
products actually are finding various other applications as well,
which this study sheds light on.<P>

Section VII is on ENVIROTOXICITY TESTING, emphasizing toxicity
tests for the effects of chemicals on the fauna and flora of the
environment.  A number of companies are positioning themselves to
take advantage of what many see as a major growth area in the
1990s.<P>

This report has SEVEN APPENDICES:  Literature references and
sources of information for this study, separate directories of
mammalian animal suppliers, nonmammalian animal suppliers and
independent testing laboratories, additional government
laboratories not described in the main text that are investigating
toxic substances of various kinds, a brief synopsis on the care of
laboratory animals, and a listing of special terminology,
abbreviations and symbols used in biohazard testing.<P>


<B>METHODOLOGY AND INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

This study is the result of three man-months of concentrated
research, analysis and writing.  Primary sources of information
were telephone interviews with 40 individuals representing animal
and in vitro product suppliers, testing service providers,
user-customers and various trade associations.  Information
obtained from these sources went beyond the ordinary and commonly
available, and concerned such matters as the kinds and percentages
of lab animals actually used for toxicology and toxicity testing,
weighted average prices of animals representing the various species
as a national whole, the volume shares of short-term vs. long-term
tests, in-house testing vs. outside contracting, and many other
details not easily obtained or widely known.<P>

Secondary sources of information were extensive amounts of
historical and current published technical and business literature,
as well as product and price catalog literature, annual reports
where available, government documents including the OTA's and NIH's
reports on the subject, and several toxicology textbooks.  This
report documents all sources of information, and an Appendix lists
our major ones.<P>

In various instances, computations had to be made.  We show our
work and our rationale.  Where assumptions had to be made, we state
what they are and the reasons for making them.<P>

Sales figures are expressed in U.S. millions of dollars ($1 MM =
$1,000,000).  Projections of future testing and of future testing
product sales are based on reasoned scenarios fully explained in
the text.  Forecasted sales for 1995 are expressed in constant 1990
dollars to reflect real changes without inflation, and assume
constant prices.  The five-year average annual growth rate
presented in tables, the AAGR, is derived by the compounding method
using standard tables of net present value.<P>

BCC and the analyst have no vested interest in any company or
product mentioned in this report.  All analyses and forecasts are
made independently, without biases.  Omissions of company names, if
any, are not intentional except when anonymity was specifically
requested because of sensitivity regarding certain subject matter.<P>

<H3><I>INTRODUCTION</I></H3>
</CENTER>

<B>REASONS FOR STUDY
</B><P>

The economic transformation of China into a free market economy,
along with its opening to foreign investment and joint ventures,
provides an enormous market opportunity.  At the same time, the
economic development of China positions the country to become a
significant competitive player on the world stage.<P>    

This study therefore offers insight into China's capabilities and
activities and offers a road map and guide to doing business with
China.<P>  

<b>OBJECTIVES AND GOALS OF STUDY</B><P>
One objective of this study is to elucidate mainland China's
capabilities and activities in biotechnology, drugs and other
medical products, agriculture and food, chemicals, and
biochemicals.  Another objective is to identify governmental,
academic, professional, trade, and manufacturing organizations with
whom foreign companies can make contact.  The third objective is to
shed light on the maze of regulations and other intricacies for
doing business with Chinese companies.<P>  

The goal of this study is to provide information and insight that
will  help "Western" companies access this enormous market.<P>

<b>AUDIENCE FOR REPORT</B><P>
Readers of this report are expected to be executives and scientists
in biotechnology, drug, medical device, agricultural, food,
chemical, enzyme and biochemical companies interested in, or
considering doing business with, China.<P>  

<b>SCOPE AND CONTENT</B><P>
This report's Overview provides a capsule view of China, including
its history, culture, people, natural resources and infrastructural
resources.  This chapter also provides a summary of mainland
China's economy in general and gives the names of individuals one
should contact for general information.<P> 

In China's New Direction we lay out the new policies that encourage
foreign investment and joint ventures, spell out the applicable
regulations and other requirements for doing business, include key
organizations to contact (including addresses and contact
personnel), and provide other useful information anyone
contemplating doing business with China should know. We also point
out the various obstacles to business dealings so readers can be
prepared beforehand.<P>  

The chapter called Medical Products encompasses pharmaceuticals and
medical equipment.  We sketch in the market sizes, provide
information on how foreign firms can access the markets, and
summarize recent joint venture activities.<P> 

We do the same in Agriculture and Food, outlining the relevant
market sizes, explain how to gain access to the market and
summarize recent activities.<P>

The chapter on Chemicals outlines the overall chemicals market in
China, offers a guide to gaining entry to the Chinese market, and
describes some of the key manufacturers.  This chapter encompasses
synthetic chemicals, plant-derived chemicals and fermentation-based
chemicals, the latter including fermentation solvents, biochemicals
and enzymes.<P>   

Hong Kong and Taiwan are discussed in a separate chapter.  We
discuss the status and future of these entities, outline the
commercial activities emphasizing medical products, and list key
contact organizations.  Because Hong Kong and Taiwan are not a part
of the People's Republic of China, this study excludes a forecast
of biotechnology-based product sales concerning these two entities.<P> 


Appendix I on Biomedical Research Institutions and Drug
Manufacturers in China lists (complete with addresses and contact
personnel) biological, medical and drug research institutions; drug
manufacturers ("drug factories"); and veterinary pharmaceutical
factories.  Appendix II on Agricultural Research Institutions and
Food Manufacturers lists agricultural and plant research
institutions; animal and veterinary research institutions; fish and
aquaculture institutions; and food and beverage factories. 
Appendix III on Chemical and Fermentation Research Institutions and
Manufacturers lists chemical research institutions; environmental
research institutions; microbial and fermentation research
institutions; agrichemical producers; fermentation solvent
companies; and biochemical and enzyme producers.  Appendix IV
provides a List of Acronyms used in this study.  Appendix V is a
list of Information Sources used for this study and which readers
can refer to independently.<P>  

<b>METHODOLOGY AND INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>
Data and information for this study comes from  the recent
technical and business press, reports issued by the American
Embassy in Beijing, the Foreign Commercial Service in various
locations inside China, the International Trade Administration, the
Chinese State Statistical Bureau, standard texts on China, and
original BCC research by telephone interviews with executives in
selected companies already doing business with China.  We also had
personal communications with knowledgeable individuals inside
China.<P>

A paucity of "hard" statistics coming out of China relevant to
commercial interests hampers the kind of detailed economic analysis
we are accustomed to in the West. Nevertheless, this study has
developed models  for possible scenarios representing future
biotechnology developments.<P>

Except where noted, all economic values are stated in U.S. dollars.
In some instances, we present figures in China's currency and the
section on Hong Kong uses some figures in Hong Kong dollars. 
Currency exchange rates are provided.<P> 

<b>CREDENTIALS</B><P>

study is a biochemist who also holds an MBA degree and who has
had international experience, professionally.  At BCC, he has
written numerous studies on all aspects of biotechnology, including
pharmaceuticals, food, diagnostics, environmental science, and
chemicals. He is also editor of Applied Genetics News and
Stereochemical Technology News.<P>

<B>STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

The basic goal of this study is to present the most complete analysis possible of the
biotechnology industry.  This study comes at a very important time in the
development of the industry.  Just as new product introductions and sales are
beginning to increase, and the range of industries affected by biotechnology grows,
there is also heightened investor interest that has been absent for the last several
years.<P>

The study answers the question:  Where has the biotechnology industry been, and
where is it going?  Also, just what is the reasonable size to expect these markets to
become?  Is this the time to invest, reinvest, increase investments, or even divest?<P>

Leading technological and commercial developments are discussed at length.
Historical perspective of the last ten years is included as well.<P>

The study addresses the basic concerns about the status of biotechnology and where
it is likely to go over the next ten years.  This includes considerations of changes in
technologies, in research direction, in product development and marketing strategies.
The shifting picture of regulatory reform at the FDA and other federal agencies is
presented, as well as the growing role of state regulation.<P>


<B>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P>

The biotechnology industry has grown significantly in the last ten years, well beyond
the expectations of most observers and participants.  In the course of growing, it has
gone into a number of areas where special skills are required.  At the same time, the
development of new disciplines and new combinations of technologies are creating a
growing number of cross-impacts from which new opportunities are quickly emerging.
This applies to all the major market segments.<P>

However, there has been no systematic effort to collect together in one place the
different activities of biotechnology in and around these market segments.  This study
was designed to look at all these different areas and to get a sense of how they are
progressing and what kinds of impacts they can be expected to make in the next
decade.<P>

Also, a number of entirely new analytical instruments and enhanced capabilities have
been introduced, especially over the last five years, which have set the stage for
working into entirely new areas of research.  Capillary electrophoresis,
multidirectional electrophoresis, and supercritical extraction are a few common
examples.<P>

The net effect is that, were one to make these measures, one would find that research
productivity has gone up significantly.  The rate at which a compound can be isolated
and analyzed has increased very significantly.  If one compares what tools were
available in 1981 with those available in 1991, it is fair to say that the difference is
dramatic.<P>

The range of DNA products, the sequencing technologies, the nuclease enzymes, and
other products introduced in the last ten years make researchers' work much easier.
Along with this, the growing use of such things as complementary DNA libraries and
the expanding range of PCR techniques have changed the way researchers get results.<P>

What all this progress means is the following:  Product development times will be
shorter, the costs will be less, and the number and types of markets and products that
can benefit from biotech-nological methods will only grow.  Thus, areas that were not
considered opportunities several years ago, will become very definite opportunities in
the next several years.  So, for example, as researchers continue to extend the range
of genetic engineering capabilities in biomaterials, new market opportunities for
advanced materials having medical and industrial applications will come into focus.
Advances in supporting technologies will only further accelerate the pace of this work.<P>

<B>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY AND FOR WHOM</B><P>

This study provides a perspective on the growth of a new industry that is not to be
found anywhere else.  The information reflects a time when there were high
expectations as well as considerable disappointment, when the efforts of individual
companies unfolded, or unraveled, as the case may be.<P>

This study provides data and other information not found anywhere else on the
technology, the markets, the products, and other areas.  The information presented
here will help in planning and investigating the many promising aspects of
biotechnology.<P>

In this respect, the study pulls together a broad array of data on finance, investment,
sales, markets, and other areas.  Taken together, this provides a frame of reference
for analyzing the biotechnology industry.<P>

The audience for this report is intended to include strategic planners, market
managers, and others involved in managing different biotechnology projects both
within their own company and in conjunction with other companies. The study is also
for those concerned with the state of the biotechnology industry and how it is
changing.  This study is unique in the extensive collection of information on
biotechnology.  It is the most complete and up-to-date report on the whole
biotechnology industry.  The report is also useful since it includes perspectives of the
dozen plus current BCC Reports on biotechnology that specialize in selected market
areas.<P>

This document should prove to be a useful source of data, an important resource for
discussion, and an aid in analysis of the industry as it changes over the next several
years.  It is fair to say that this is the best collection of information on biotechnology.<P>


<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

The scope of the study is the whole biotechnology industry.  As such it includes work
in biotherapeutics, diagnostics, industrial biotechnology, agricultural biotechnology,
marine biotechnology, and the research market for biotechnology.<P>

The overall format is organized to look at overall issues, then the leading technologies,
then products under develoment, then products that are on the market and the
companies that are involved.<P>

There is also a section on international biotechology.  It considers the likely
competitors to the U.S. and how their positions have changed over the last several
years, as well as what they are likely to do next.<P>


<B>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

The methodology for the preparation of this study included interviews, scanning of
secondary sources, and the development of estimates and analyses in those places
where the necessary information was lacking.<P>

Market estimates are based on 1990 dollars and go through the year 2000.  Most
estimates are limited to the U.S., but, where appropriate, world market figures are
included as well.<P>


<B>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

The several dozen trade and technical publications in biotechnology and related areas
were scanned for key information on the current directions of biotechnology.  In
addition, back issues of these sources as well as computer searches were conducted in
reconstructing the recent history of biotechnology.<P>

Customers, researchers, marketing managers, and company presidents were among
those interviewed in seeking information about the different biotechnology market
segments, as well as their perspectives on the progress of biotechnology over the last
ten years.<P>

<B>RELATED BCC WORK CREDENTIALS</B><P>

The analyst for this study, Cort Wrotnowski, has extensive experience in market
research and analysis for biotechnology.  He has done approximately a dozen studies
over the last 8 years on behalf of BCC.  He has presented a number of conference
papers, written articles for trade publications, and consulted on a variety of special
assignments for Fortune 500 firms involving biotech-nological products and markets.
He has a BA in Biology from the State University of New York at Purchase.<P>

Related BCC Studies are listed in the back of this report.<P>

</CENTER>

<B>STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

The basic goal of this study is to present the most complete
analysis possible of the bioreagent business.  The kinds of
products being developed and used in this area are critical to the
future progress of biotechnology.  The accelerating pace of
molecular biology is putting increasing pressure on suppliers to
develop products that save time and money, while also helping to
improve the performance of researchers.<P>

This study comes at a very important time in the development of
biotechnology. While there is increasingly visible interest in and
discussion about innovation in biotechnology, at the same time new
and novel products are being introduced at a faster pace.  Some are
simple, others are sophisticated. Taken together, they represent a
growing tool-box of increasing versatility in research and product
development.  Moreover, this applies to all the areas of product
development, including but not limited to biotherapeutics,
diagnostics, industrial applications and environmental
applications.<P>

The study answers the questions: Where has the bioreagent business
been, and where is it going?  Just what is the reasonable size
these markets will become?  What are the important new product
trends, and how will changing directions in research affect reagent
demand?<P>

Leading technological and commercial developments are discussed in
the report.  Also, important regulatory and financial issues are
covered.<P>

The study addresses the many different issues, general and
specific, that are expected to shape the bioreagent business over
the rest of the decade. This includes considerations of changes in
technologies, in research direction, in product development and
marketing strategies.  The shifting picture of regulatory reform at
the FDA and other federal agencies is presented, as well as the
growing role of international competition and cooperation.<P>

<B>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P>

The biotechnology industry has grown significantly in the last 10
years,  well beyond the expectations of most observers and
participants.  In the course of growing, it has gone into a number
of areas where special skills are required.  At the same time, the
development of new disciplines, and new combinations of
technologies are creating a growing number of cross-impacts from
which new opportunities are quickly emerging.  This applies to all
the major market segments.<P>

Not only has this pattern of development had an impact on the much-
watched commercial opportunities in biotherapeutics, it has also
affected the supporting technologies.  In particular, the various
compounds, reagent systems, kits, and other products used to
control and study biological reactions have undergone a number of
changes.  The net effect has been to reduce the amount of time a
researcher needs to carry out routine research tasks.  Further,
there is an ongoing effort to reduce the time and cost associated
with the many techniques of molecular biology.  This is a quiet
revolution, the impact of which is still only beginning to be felt.<P>

This study was designed to look at the many different kinds of
products and market segments.  The purpose was to get a sense of
how they are changing and how they will likely change in the next
decade.<P>

The basic assertion is that improved reagents improve research
results.  The net effect is that were one to make these measures,
one would find that research productivity has gone up
significantly. The rate at which a compound can be isolated and
analyzed has increased very significantly.  If one compares what
tools were available in 1981, as compared with 1991, it is fair to
say that the difference is dramatic.<P>

An unanswered question, though, is the relative contribution of new
reagents as compared with the contribution of new analytical
equipment (and computers).  The most likely answer is that they are
inextricably linked.  Advances in one are dependent on and
influenced by advances in the other.<P>

The range of DNA products, sequencing technologies, endonuclease
enzymes, and other products introduced in the last ten years, make
researchers' work much easier.  Along with this, the growing use of
gene libraries, and the expanding range of PCR techniques have
changed the way researchers get results.<P>

What all this progress means is the following:  Product development
times will be shorter, the costs will be less, and the number and
types of markets and products that can benefit from
biotechnological methods will only grow.  Thus, areas that were not
considered opportunities several years ago, will become very
definite opportunities in the next several years.  So, for example,
as researchers continue to extend the range of genetic engineering
capabilities in biomaterials, new market opportunities for advanced
materials having medical and industrial applications will come into
focus.  Advances in supporting technologies will only further
accelerate the pace of this work.<P>

Thus, an important part of the study is to look at new reagents
being introduced and to ask questions about the kinds that are
needed for the future.<P>


<B>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY AND FOR WHOM</B><P>

This study provides a perspective on the growth of an important and
complex business. It provides data and other information not found
anywhere else on the technology, markets, products and other areas.
The information presented here will help in assessment and
evaluation of the many promising features of the bioreagent
business.<P>

In this respect, the study pulls together a broad array of data on
finance, investment, sales, markets and other areas.  Taken
together, this provides a frame of reference for analyzing the
bioreagent business.<P>

The audience for this report is intended to include strategic
planners, market managers, and others involved in managing
different projects both within their own company and in conjunction
with other companies. The study is also for those interested in
gaining important information about the bioreagent marketplace in
the US and how it is changing.  This study is unique in the
extensive collection of information on bioreagents.  It is the most
complete and up-to-date report on the bioreagent marketplace.  The
report is also useful since it includes perspectives from the dozen
or more current BCC reports on biotechnology industry.<P>

This document should prove to be a useful source of data, and an
important resource for discussion, and an aid in analysis of the
industry as it changes over the next several years.<P>

<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

It is fair to say that this is the best collection of information
on biotechnology. The scope of the study is the bioreagent
industry.  This is a complex and multifaceted business.  There are
many tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of individual
products that are used in highly specialized, and not-so-
specialized applications in biotherapeutics, diagnostics,
industrial biotechnology, agricultural biotechnology, marine
biotechnology, and analytical biotechnology.  Among the research
areas considered are molecular biology, cell biology, immunology,
AIDS research, the genome project, virology, and PCR-related work.<P>

The format is organized to look at overall issues, the leading
technologies, products under development, products that are on the
market and the companies that are involved.<P>

There is also a section on international biotechology.  It
considers the leading suppliers competing with US bioreagent
suppliers, and how their positions have changed over the last
several years, as well as what they are likely to do next.<P>

<B>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

The methodology for the preparation of this study included
interviews, scanning of secondary sources, and the development of
estimates and analyses in those places where the necessary
information was lacking.<P>

Market estimates are based on current U.S. dollars and project
through the year 2000.  Most estimates are limited to the US, but,
where appropriate, world market figures are included as well.<P>

<B>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

The several dozen trade and technical publications in biotechnology
and related areas were perused for key information on the current
directions of biotechnology.  In addition, back issues of these
sources, as well as computer searches, were conducted in
reconstructing the recent history of biotechnology.  Key trade
shows were attended and important individuals interviewed.<P>

Company presidents, researchers, purchasing agents, marketing
managers and company presidents were among those interviewed in
seeking information about the different bioreagent market segments,
as well as their perspectives on the outlook for bioreagents in the
coming years.<P>

<B>RELATED BCC WORK CREDENTIALS</B><P>

<B>OBJECTIVES AND GOALS OF STUDY</B><P>

The  objectives  of  this  study are to comprehensively  analyze  the
entire enzyme industry, to identify actual and potential applications
of  enzymes, to quantify the sales value of enzyme products,  and  to
assess  the  impact  of new technologies that may either  improve  or
retard  the  prospects  for commercial enzymes.   The  goals  are  to
provide meaningful data and unbiased analysis and assessment  of  the
roles  enzymes  play now and the roles they could have in the future.
This study also updates a previously published comprehensive analysis
of the enzyme industry.<P>


<B>SCOPE OF STUDY</B><P>

All  categories  of  enzymes are covered in this  study:  hydrolases;
oxidoreductases;  isomerases;  transferases;  ligases;  and  ligases.
Within  the hydrolases we include proteases, carbohydrases,  lipases,
nucleases amidases, and phosphatases.<P>

All  applications  of enzymes are covered: C-147A  covers  industrial
(food,   detergents,   textiles,  leather,  paper),   and   chemicals
manufacture   applications.  C-147B  covers  specialty   (analytical,
biotechnology,  research)  and medical  applications.  C-147C  is  an
Enzyme Directory.<P>


Absolutely  nothing  has been intentionally  left  out.   This  study
quantifies sales and consumption for the major enzymes of commerce in
the  respective  fields  of application, but  in  some  instances  we
provide  aggregative  estimates.  We do not comprehensively  quantify
sales and consumption for each and every enzyme known to  exist.<P>


<B>AUDIENCE FOR REPORT</B><P>

This  report  is  intended  for  business  executives  interested  in
enzymes,  including  enzyme  suppliers,  enzyme  users,  and   enzyme
investors.   Scientists  interested in the  business  perspective  of
enzymes will find this study informative.<P>


<B>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

This  study results from three man-months of effort. Primary  sources
of  information  were  direct telephone  interviews  with  sales  and
technical  staffs  among  enzyme  suppliers  and  with  knowledgeable
technical and business people among enzyme users. We also interviewed
appropriate  industry associations for industry-wide  practices  with
regard  to enzyme usages.  Secondary sources of information  included
product  literature  from  enzyme suppliers and  numerous  scientific
references.  We also made use of in-house computerized literature and
patent  searching capabilities.  BCC's Applied Genetics  News  proved
invaluable.<P>

Sales  (and captive values) for enzymes are expressed in millions  of
dollars  ($1 MM = 106).  Forecasts of enzyme sales and value  are  in
constant  1993  dollars.  The average annual growth  rate  (AAGR)  is
derived  by  the  compounding method.  Quantities of  enzyme  protein
consumption  are  expressed in kilograms. All sales  and  consumption
figures  refer  to  the United States, unless otherwise  specifically
indicated. Brand names are in capital letters.  Mentions of  products
are  not  endorsements, and omissions, if any, are  not  intentional.
Analyses   are  made  independently,  without  the  bias  of   vested
interests.<P>

<B>OBJECTIVES AND GOALS OF STUDY</B><P>

The  objectives  of  this  study are to comprehensively  analyze  the
entire enzyme industry, to identify actual and potential applications
of  enzymes, to quantify the sales value of enzyme products,  and  to
assess  the  impact  of new technologies that may either  improve  or
retard  the  prospects  for commercial enzymes.   The  goals  are  to
provide meaningful data and unbiased analysis and assessment  of  the
roles  enzymes  play now and the roles they could have in the future.
This study also updates a previously published comprehensive analysis
of the enzyme industry.<P>


<B>SCOPE OF STUDY</B><P>

All  categories  of  enzymes are covered in this  study:  hydrolases;
oxidoreductases;  isomerases;  transferases;  ligases;  and  ligases.
Within  the hydrolases we include proteases, carbohydrases,  lipases,
nucleases amidases, and phosphatases.<P>

All  applications  of enzymes are covered: C-147A  covers  industrial
(food,  detergents, textiles, leather, paper), chemicals  manufacture
applications.  C-147B  covers  specialty (analytical,  biotechnology,
research) and medical applications. C-147C is an Enzyme Directory.

Absolutely  nothing  has been intentionally  left  out.   This  study
quantifies sales and consumption for the major enzymes of commerce in
the  respective  fields  of application, but  in  some  instances  we
provide  aggregative  estimates.  We do not comprehensively  quantify
sales and consumption for each and every enzyme known to  exist.<P>


<B>AUDIENCE FOR REPORT</B><P>

This  report  is  intended  for  business  executives  interested  in
enzymes,  including  enzyme  suppliers,  enzyme  users,  and   enzyme
investors.   Scientists  interested in the  business  perspective  of
enzymes will find this study informative.<P>


<B>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

This  study results from three man-months of effort. Primary  sources
of  information  were  direct telephone  interviews  with  sales  and
technical  staffs  among  enzyme  suppliers  and  with  knowledgeable
technical and business people among enzyme users. We also interviewed
appropriate  industry associations for industry-wide  practices  with
regard  to enzyme usages.  Secondary sources of information  included
product  literature  from  enzyme suppliers and  numerous  scientific
references.  We also made use of in-house computerized literature and
patent  searching capabilities.  BCC's Applied Genetics  News  proved
invaluable.<P>

Sales  (and captive values) for enzymes are expressed in millions  of
dollars  ($1 MM = 106).  Forecasts of enzyme sales and value  are  in
constant  1993  dollars.  The average annual growth  rate  (AAGR)  is
derived  by  the  compounding method.  Quantities of  enzyme  protein
consumption  are  expressed in kilograms. All sales  and  consumption
figures  refer  to  the United States, unless otherwise  specifically
indicated. Brand names are in capital letters.  Mentions of  products
are  not  endorsements, and omissions, if any, are  not  intentional.
Analyses   are  made  independently,  without  the  bias  of   vested
interests.<P>

This  Enzyme Directory identifies suppliers of enzymes.  The goal  is
to  provide  a  handy  reference so that the worldwide  suppliers  of
individual enzymes can be readily looked up.  We rely on company self-
reporting for these identifications and cannot confirm that companies
do in fact supply the enzymes they say they do (although most, if not
all,  do  supply the enzymes they claim).  This Directory  identifies
suppliers in the sense that they offer enzymes for sale to customers.<P>

We  have not comprehensively determined whether in fact the suppliers
produce  the enzymes they offer or merely distribute enzymes produced
by   others,  although  the  Company  Profiles  section  gives   some
indications in this regard for certain companies.  Some companies may
produce  the  enzymes  they  sell, while  other  companies  may  only
distribute enzymes without producing any of them.  Some companies may
produce only certain of the enzymes they sell, while merely acting as
distributors of other enzymes  they offer.<P>
                                  
This  Enzyme Directory uses the common names of enzymes, rather  than
the  formal  designations assigned by the Enzyme  Commission  of  the
International  Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry. Where  an  enzyme
has  more  than  one common name, we use the one we believe  is  most
frequently used and provide cross-referencing.<P>
                                  
We  do  not  differentiate enzymes on the basis of source or  origin,
even  if  subtle  differences in specificity may  exist.   Thus,  for
example,  we  do not differentiate between the DNA polymerase  of  E.
coli,  Micrococcus luteus, T4 bacteriophage and T7 bacteriophage,  or
between  bacterial and calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase. However,
where  the source of enzyme has special connotations, we do make  the
distinction, e.g., Taq DNA polymerase.  Future editions may  be  made
more detailed in this regard.  In some instances the Company Profiles
section of this directory provides more details than does the  Enzyme
Suppliers section, and readers are advised to check these details.<P>

The   Company  Profiles  section  of  this  Directory  provides   the
addresses, telephone numbers and fax numbers of companies   from  all
over  the  world  that  supply enzymes.   We  provide  brief  general
descriptions  of  the  companies,  identify  their  focus  of  market
applications, and list the enzymes they supply.<P>

Two observations about this Directory are worth noting:<P>

1) Sales of an enzyme roughly correlate with the number of suppliers.
Although  no precise mathematical formula can be set down correlating
sales  with the number of suppliers, it can be said that the  greater
the sales of an enzyme in its market, the more likely it will attract
many suppliers.<P>

2) For any particular enzyme, the list of suppliers hints at business
relationships   between  the  true  producer(s)  and   those   merely
distributing  the enzyme but not producing it.  This  Directory  does
not  pursue the delineation of these business relationships,  but  it
can serve as a useful starting point.<P>

This  Directory  does  not  provide sales estimates  or  analysis  of
applications   and  markets  for  enzymes.   Two  companion   studies
accomplish those goals:<P>

<B>STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

The primary objective of this study is to examine the markets for
the various compounds used to tag gene probe and immunoassay
products, so that an accurate demand forecast can be developed and
the market/industry structural changes can be predicted.  In order
to complete this task, a close examination of the forces impacting
on both markets and industry dynamics are determined and evaluated.<P>


Specifically, we expect to ascertain the consequences of the
current and expected future diagnostic/test regulatory environment
on tags usage.  Regulations issued through the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA), the Dept. of Agriculture (USDA),
the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) are carefully assessed so that the their
impact on industry structure and demand dynamics can be accurately
forecast.<P>

Further technical developments will be assessed to determine if
there is an impact on demand for the various tagging reagents. In
the event of a major impact, we would like to understand what the
probable outcome of that development will be.  Technical advances
in both detection and diagnostics will be examined, as they both
have the potential to impact on the label and linker industry.<P>

We also examine the international markets and trade so that a
situational analysis of the U.S. label and linker industry can be
performed.  In addition to facilitating an understanding of the
U.S. market, it will also provide a basic understanding of European
and Japanese markets.<P>

Finally, we profile companies that supply the industry.  We also
briefly characterize distributors and, when possible, consuming
companies.<P>


<B>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P>

Our study is intended to help industry participants better
understand the complex environment where they do business. By
identifying and examining the issues associated with markets,
regulations, technology, and trade, industry players will be better
able to make decisions; managers will be able to enhance both and
company and product positioning generate increased returns.<P>


<B>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY AND FOR WHOM</B><P>

The contents and conclusions of the study will be valuable for a
wide variety of label and linker industry managers, including:
strategic planners, marketers, product development professionals,
purchasing agents, and sales staff.  These decision-makers will be
better able to plan production, to develop new products and to find
new customers.  Planners and marketers will gain insight for
company and product positioning.  Purchasers will locate new and
additional suppliers.<P>

Managers from several related industries will also find valuable
information in the report.  Distributors, test formulators, traders
and even test laboratory professionals can benefit from a better
understanding of the tag/linkage business and how it influences
competition in their own industries.<P>

<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

The focus of this study is on the U.S. market supply and demand for
compounds used in the linkage and labeling of diagnostic and test
materials.  Several industrial segments are examined, including the
human health care segment comprising clinical, hospital, doctors
office and home sectors; the dental market; the in vivo imaging
market; the forensic/paternity market; the food market; the
environmental and plant agricultural markets; and finally the
research market.  Emphasis has been put on human health care since
it is the largest sector.  In relation to the other segments, it is
at least an order of magnitude larger, and frequently more than two
orders of magnitude larger.  Thus, we feel it warrants particular
emphasis.<P>

It is important to point out that many of the numerous materials
used by diagnostic producers are not covered by this report.
First, as the title indicates, we have limited the scope to
chemicals used in tagging gene probe or immunoassay products.
Next, we do not cover some of the segments that are not related to
human health care, such as industrial and veterinary tests.  And
finally, only chemicals with sufficiently large unit volume demand
or dollar volume are examined.<P>

As might be expected, the diversity of materials used in research
applications is far greater than that of commercial areas.  This
makes forecasting for the segment particularly difficult.  However,
we have identified the larger volume items and discussed them at
length.  Market demand forecasts, both unit volume and dollar, are
developed for each of the larger volume reagents and the total
demand - the total for all sectors included in this report and not
inclusive of other outlets - is determined.
Major factors impacting on the label/linker supply and demand are
discussed.  Government regulations, technology, patents and
international trade are all examined.  European and Japanese
suppliers and markets are briefly discussed, together with trade.<P>

Finally, we arrive at conclusions to facilitate the formation of
specific plans of action by industry participants.  Although the
study is not geared toward any particular supplier, the analysis
and conclusions are detailed in a manner that each will find
valuable.<P>

The table of contents serves as an outline for the study.  Specific
sections include: Introduction, Summary, Overview, Regulatory
Environment, Tagging and Linkage Reagents, Markets for Tagging and
Linkage Reagents, Technology, Patents, Material Prices, Selected
Company Expertise, International Arena, Industry Structure and
Selected Company Profiles.  For more detail, see the Table of
Contents.<P>


<B>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

Information was gathered using both primary and secondary sources.
Background information was pieced together from a multitude of
secondary sources, and complementary and supplementary information
was developed with telephone interviews.<P>

Specific analysis includes value chain assessment, strategic
positioning maps, and life cycle evaluations of both markets and
technologies.  Technical and regulatory analysis yielded valuable
information that facilitated the understanding of the direction and
magnitude of market demand for various product segments.  The key
elements impacting on market demand were determined so that
specific demand forecasts could be developed for each product.<P>



<B>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

Secondary data were derived from: technical books; directories;
journals;  periodicals; computerized literature searches; product
catalogs and bulletins; company newsletters and annual reports;
government reports; consultant reports and newsletters; and trade
association bulletins.<P>

Interviews were conducted with numerous knowledgeable individuals,
including employees of diagnostic/test companies from such
departments as Technical Services, Marketing, R&D, and Purchasing.
Staff were interviewed from distributing firms, primarily in the
technical service and marketing departments, and from domestic raw
material producers, mostly from marketing department.  Discussions
with  newsletter authors and other consultants provided additional
information.  Exchanges with association personnel and academics
were informative.  And finally, interviews with government
regulatory agencies contributed greatly to the value of the study.<P>

<B>STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

The goal of this report is to forecast the dollar amounts of
markets worldwide for inherited disease gene pharmaceuticals.  The
forecast period covers roughly the first ten years that inherited
disease gene pharmaceuticals will be in commercialization.  Markets
are defined by specific inherited disease, by entry date, by degree
and pace of market penetration, by geography, and where warranted,
by gene pharmaceutical type.<P>

Further, gene therapies are contrasted with competing
conventional technologies for inherited disease treatment to
generate forecasts of which mode of therapy will be used in a
specific disease or within patient subsets of that disease.  The
reader is thus informed not only of the market potential of
inherited disease gene therapies but of all possible competing
conventional therapies now in use or in development.<P>

<B>REASONS FOR CONDUCTING THE STUDY</B><P>

Inherited disease gene therapy was chosen as the study topic
for several reasons: 1) human gene therapy has advanced rapidly
within the past several years, and it is now feasible to develop on
a large scale, 2) the inherited diseases where gene therapy is
technically feasible at this date may be clearly identified, 3) the
clinical parameters that gene therapy must achieve in those
inherited diseases to be both therapeutically and commercially
successful may be unambiguously defined, 4) the therapeutic and
thus commercial potential of conventional therapy competitors to
inherited disease gene therapies may be assessed with a high degree
of confidence, 5) the inherited diseases analyzed here treated by
conventional means generate pharmaceutical sales and other medical
expenditures in the billions of dollars annually, up to $5.8
billion of which inherited disease gene therapies can capture, 6)
inherited disease gene pharmaceuticals should display as a group
among the highest profit margins available today in the
pharmaceutical industry.<P>

<B>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY AND INTENDED AUDIENCE</B><P>

This study defines the inherited disease gene pharmaceutical
market, projects which inherited disease pharmaceuticals now under
development will be commercially successful and which will not, and
identifies inherited diseases that may be the subject of commercial
gene pharmaceutical development in the future.  Every parameter of
inherited disease gene therapy germane to commercial success is
analyzed here in depth, including: 1) clinical efficacy potential,
2) risk potential, 3) regulatory  hurdles,  and 4) methods for
applying gene pharmaceuticals clinically and their impact on
commercial distribution channels.  For each of the inherited
diseases analyzed here, gene therapy is also contrasted with both
current and developing conventional therapies across four critical
parameters: 1) efficacy, 2) risk, 3) ease of use, and 4) price.
The analysis is used to define the market potential for gene
therapy in a specific inherited disease and also to indicate the
market potential of competing conventional therapies, even those
that are only now in development.  Actual markets for inherited
disease gene therapies are derived from this technical analysis.<P>

This study is intended for venture capitalists, investment
bankers, industry and financial analysts, business development
professionals, strategic planners, marketing groups, consultants
and independent investors - in short, anyone whose work or
investments  are in some fashion related to human pharmaceuticals.
Though some of the topics this study covers are necessarily of a
technical nature, it is written to appeal to both lay and
scientifically literate audiences.<P>

diseases for which gene therapy is now tenable are defined in
Chapter 2, "Technical Dimensions: Inherited Disease Gene Therapy."
In summary, those inherited diseases must: 1) be prevalent enough
in likely market countries to warrant commercial interest, 2) have
a well defined defect in a single gene, 3) have normal copies of
the gene available for use in gene pharmaceuticals, and 4) be
amenable to correction by the insertion of a non-defective copy of
the causative gene into appropriate cells within the patient.<P>

All inherited diseases were considered in the early phases of
this study.  Those that met the above criteria are analyzed here:
Cystic Fibrosis, the Hemoglobinopathies (b-thalassemia and Sickle
Cell Anemia), the Hemophilias (A and B), Hereditary Emphysema,
Lysosomal Storage Disorders (Fabry's Disease, Gaucher's Disease,
Hunter's Disease and Hurler's Disease), the Muscular Dystrophies
(Becher's and Duchenne's) and Phenylketonuria.  The number of
people afflicted by these diseases in likely market areas - defined
here as the United States, Australia, Canada, Europe and Japan - is
approximately 600,000.  ADA Deficiency and Hypercholesterolemia are
also discussed here in some detail due to their status as the first
inherited diseases for which gene therapy was approved in the
United States, but they are too rare to be commercially viable.<P>

The bulk of the study - Chapters 2 through 4 - is  organized
by specific inherited disease to make the analysis easy to follow.
Those chapters describe the technical requirements for inherited
disease gene therapy, analyze current and developing conventional
treatments for inherited diseases that could compete with gene
therapy, and develop discrete market forecasts across the
geographic areas identified above.  Additional chapters: 1) define
the components of inherited disease gene pharmaceuticals, their
manufacture and keys to commercial value, 2) describe government
regulatory policies that bear on inherited disease gene therapy
commercialization, and 3) describe the structure of the gene
therapy industry and the general determinants of a particular
firm's commercial potential.<P>

<B>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

Technical, scientific, market and regulatory issues were
determined as described below.  The formal market forecasts
presented here are based on technical parameters (primarily
risk/efficacy potentials of the inherited disease gene therapy and
development barriers), probable market entry dates (determined from
company literature and interviews), an analysis of market
penetration functions (degree and pace of market penetration) and
probable inherited disease gene pharmaceutical pricing (derived
from the medical costs incurred with conventional treatments and
the relative clinical efficacies of them and inherited disease gene
therapies).<P>

<B>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

A thorough review of all pertinent primary scientific
literature on gene therapy and the inherited diseases was first
conducted to establish key scientific, technological and initial
market parameters for inherited disease gene pharmaceuticals.
Primary gene therapy companies, regulatory agencies, secondary
literature (the popular and business press) and associations for
the inherited diseases were consulted to define fully all market
parameters and to establish the regulatory and government policy
issues that  could affect inherited disease gene therapy
commercialization.<P>

<B>OBJECTIVES AND GOALS</B><P>

The objectives  of this  study are  to examine biotechnology's
role in  environmental testing  and to assess, quantitatively,
its growth prospects.   The goal is to bring this little-known
application  of   biotechnology  to  the  attention  of  those
concerned with the environment.<P>


<B>REASONS FOR THE STUDY AND ITS CONTRIBUTION</B><P>


Environmental concerns  are on  nearly everyone's  mind today,

and now  industry must  take into  account  the  environmental

effects in all of its manufacturing and discard practices.<P>


Environmental testing  is the  means  by  which  industry  and

municipalities, as  well as  government regulators,  determine

whether pollutants  have  entered  the  environment  and  also

whether remediation and abatement methods are working.<P>


Although little  recognized, biotechnology  is offering up new

products for  carrying out  environmental  testing,  and  they

represent competitive  alternatives  to  conventional  testing

methods and products.  Moreover, the technologies and products

becoming  available   have  potentials  beyond  the  immediate

applications.   It is  worthwhile, therefore,  to examine what

biotechnology-based testing  has to  offer and  to assess  its

impact.<P>


<B>REPORT'S SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>


This  report   examines   biotechnology-based   products   for

environmental  testing,   the  latter  being  defined  as  the

analysis of  soil, water,  and air  for the presence, identity

and quantity of chemical substances.<P>


Excluded from  this study  is  the  determination  of  whether

substances are  toxic or  hazardous.   Also excluded  are  the

testing of  non-environmental samples  such  as  food,  animal

tissue, human  tissue and  plant materials  and the testing of

and for  micro-organisms.   Except for  comparative  purposes,

conventional methods  and products  for environmental  testing

are also excluded.<P>


This report  divides into  six  sections,  not  including  the

introduction and  summary, and includes two appendices.  After

the  INTRODUCTION  and  SUMMARY,  the  report  opens  with  an

OVERVIEW of  environmental testing and biotechnology's role in

it,  including   the  importance   of  environmental   testing

generally and  its impact  on industry.   We  next present the

INDUSTRY STRUCTURE  AND DYNAMICS  of environmental  testing in

general and of biotechnology-based products in particular, and

this section  includes a description of the key players in the

supply of  biotechnology-based environmental testing products.

Then we briefly review the TECHNOLOGIES of biotechnology-based

testing,  comparing  the  technologies  among  themselves  and

against conventional  environmental testing technologies.  The

next section describes and compares the various biotechnology-

based  testing   PRODUCTS.     The  final  section  describes,

discusses, and  analyzes  the  APPLICATIONS  AND  MARKETS  for

biotechnology-based  environmental   testing  products,  which

includes sales  estimates and a forecast of sales, broken down

in several  ways.   Appendix I lists the key references on the

subject, and  Appendix  II  describes  application  areas  for

biotechnology-based  testing  products  that  relate  to  (but

differ from) environmental testing.<P>


<B>METHODOLOGY FOR STUDY</B><P>


All the available product and company literature was collected

and reviewed.   We  telephone  interviewed  key  participants,

including company  presidents, product  and  market  managers,

scientists,  and   government   regulators,   for   additional

information.<P>


All estimates  and forecasts  refer to the United States only.

Figures are  expressed in  millions of  dollars ($1  MM = $1 x

106).   Forecasts for  1997 and 2002 are expressed in constant

1992 dollars.   The  average annual  growth rates,  AAGR,  are

derived by the compounding method.<P>


All analyses  are made  without the  bias of vested interests.

Mentions of  companies and  products are not endorsements, and

omissions, if  any, are not intentional.  Brand names or trade

names are indicated by the use of capital letters.<P>

<B>STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

Immunoassays represent a large and diverse market.  The goal of this study is to
examine the state of technological development, to assess the immunoassay market
by the applications for which they are used, by the basic method used for the assay,
and to identify and forecast the impact of trends that are presently affecting the
industry.<P>



<B>REASONS FOR DOING THIS STUDY</B><P>

Immunoassay technologies have grown very rapidly in a short period of time.
Saturation has occurred in certain areas, while penetration is just beginning in others.

A great deal of similar work has been done on smaller segments of the industry.
Monoclonal antibodies, reagents for biotechnology, labels, and medical diagnostic kits
are industries that extend from or into immunoassays.  This report looks at the whole
industry and will provide critical information for decision-makers.<P>



<B>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY AND FOR WHOM</B><P>


<B>IMMUNOASSAYS</B><P>

This study examines the development of immunoassay technologies and the trends
affecting different methods.  It investigates applications for immunoassays and the
sizes of those markets through 1997.<P>


<B>REAGENTS</B><P>

The majority of companies that develop and market reagents also participate in the
immunoassay industry.  For companies that operate solely within the reagent
business, it presents clear, accurate assessments of the markets for their products and
key information concerning research and development efforts in the immunoassay
industry.<P>

<B>NEW INDUSTRY PARTICIPANTS AND PRESENT PLAYERS</B><P>

Of interest to both present industry participants and potential future participants,
this report identifies the market leaders in the immunoassay industry.  Market
leaders are noted and profiled.  And, through an evaluation of related U.S. patents,
technological leaders have been distinguished from the group.<P>


<B>INSTRUMENTATION AND DEVICE PRODUCERS</B><P>

While these facets of the immunoassay industry are not investigated directly, the
information presented reveals trends that influence sales of these products.  The
immunoassay markets are presented by application and by assay method.  In addition,
the degree of automation, by application, is discussed.<P>


<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

The focus of this report is an assessment of immunoassay technologies and markets.
The report examines reagents: immunoassay technology development, industry
market leaders, and industry technological leaders.<P>

A complete patent analysis on immunoassays has been performed and included
because of the specialized nature of this technology.  The data-gathering portion of
this study started with a review of the pertinent U.S. patent literature.  Follow-up
calls were made to the relevant workers in the field as part of our industry contact
effort.  Market information was gathered, analyzed, and complemented by an analysis
of 727 patents that have been identified.  This study is divided into two distinct parts:<P>

(1) A market research study and industry analysis, and<P>
(2) A complete patent review, identifying involution phenomena,
 activity by assignee, technological positions, and identification of immunoassay technology ownership. In addition, there is a
 complete listing of abstracts of all patents included in the study.<P>

Market leaders and technological leaders are identified; they are not necessarily the
same companies.<P>


<B>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

For many years BCC has provided insightful analyses of the biotechnology industry.
As detailed in the last section of the introduction, many of the studies focus on
specific portions of the immunoassay industry.<P>

The information presented in this study comes from various sources.  These include:<P>

<UL>                        Review of U.S. patents<BR>
                        BCC business opportunity reports<BR>
                        Industry participants<BR>
                        Government data<BR>
                        Trade and relevant literature.</UL><P>

All sales figure presented, unless otherwise indicated, are presented in millions of U.S.
dollars.  Forecasts are presented in constant 1991 dollars, and the figures refer to U.S.
sales on the manufacturer level.  All forecasts are presented in table form, and critical
assumptions and influential factors are listed.<P>

<H3><I>INTRODUCTION</I></H3>
</CENTER>

<B>REASONS FOR THE STUDY</B><P>

Lipids were once the primary sources of aliphatic carbon
compounds used by industry.  With the arrival of petroleum, the
consumption of lipids declined in most industrial applications,
although obviously they still retain their strong position in
foods and feeds.<P>

Today, market forces, regulations, and concerns about the
environment once again bring lipid materials to the fore, as an
alternative to petrochemicals.  At the very same time, new
technologies have come along to create new and modified lipids
and to introduce new properties and performance characteristics.
New vegetable oils are near commercial introduction.<P>

Since lipids appear to be on the verge of renaissance, it will be
critical to assess the market opportunities for the new
technologies and products and to understand the forces for change
in the years ahead.<P>


<B>OBJECTIVE AND GOALS</B><P>

This study has two primary objectives:  (1) to quantitatively
assess the impact of new lipid technologies and new types of
lipid materials; and (2) to quantitatively analyze the lipid
industry in terms of the end-use consumption and consumption
value of lipids by products, functional applications, and market
outlets.  The goals of this study are to provide information,
facts and data that would allow business managers to make
intelligent decisions and enhance their corporate positions.<P>


<B>SCOPE OF STUDY AND ITS CONTRIBUTION</B><P>

Lipids comprehensively analyzed in this study are triglycerides
and their derivatives, fatty acids and their derivatives, natural
plant and animal waxes, and phospholipids.  Only briefly
mentioned are glycerol, phytosterols, tocopherols, sphingolipids,
cerebrosides, glycolipids, and other types of lipids.  For the
lipids covered, all functional applications and all markets are
discussed and thoroughly analyzed.<P>

All major conventional and new technologies bearing on lipids are
discussed:  chemical modification and derivatization processes
and the catalysts employed, enzyme technology, conventional plant
breeding, and biotechnology.<P>

The study provides independent, unbiased discussions and
assessment of new technologies and new product and market
developments.  The study provides a diligent effort to quantify
end-use consumptions and values and also includes data on the
production of key intermediates.<P>

<B>REPORT AUDIENCE</B><P>

This study will serve the interests of companies in lipid
manufacturing and lipid supply, new technology firms applying
their expertise to lipids, and those considering investments,
joint ventures, or acquisitions relating to the lipid business.<P>


<B>METHODOLOGY AND INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

Information for this study was derived from government data,
company data, published trade data, scientific literature, in-
house patent searches, and an extensive number of telephone
interviews with market managers, product managers, technical
managers, and academic scientists.<P>

Consumption data refer to end uses and include both captive and
open-market consumption.  Dollar values for the consumption use
prices appropriate for the specific applications.  In most cases
the data refer to U.S. consumption and value.  This study also
provides U.S. import and export data.<P>

Consumption is stated in millions of pounds (MM lbs.), where 1
U.S. ton = 2,000 lbs., 1 lb. = 0.45359 kilogram, and 1 metric ton
= 1,000 kilograms = 2,205 lbs.  Dollar values refer to U.S.
currency and 1997 forecasts are expressed in constant 1992
dollars to reflect real changes without inflation.<P>

In our analyses of new technologies, we do not assume that
products introduced to the marketplace with the help of new
technologies will actually sell.  This assumption is at least
subjected to questioning and examination in the belief that it
serves industry more to investigate the technical-market
interface.  If events should turn out not exactly as planned,
then by our analyses companies would be in an advance position to
deal with new realities.  Conversely, we also identify reasons

<B>STUDY GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

Most market studies of marine-derived biomaterials have been conducted as 
segments of much larger studies of subjects such as aquaculture, commercial 
opportunities from the oceans, hydrocolloids, gums, thickeners, water soluble 
polymers, biotechnology, etc.  Such studies, while useful, have taken a "broad 
brush" approach and have not provided in-depth analysis of the large, 
important and growing marine biopolymer and marine biotechnology sectors.  It 
is the intention of this report to address this shortcoming by focusing on 
each of these important and growing industries.  In Part 1, we provide a 
detailed analysis of the important commercial, marine-derived, biopolymers and 
in Part 2, we provide an in-depth analysis of products derived from marine 
biotechnology which have, or someday will have, significant commercial 
potential.<P>  

Other than the marine biopolymers, surprisingly few commercially significant 
biomaterials have been derived from marine sources.  This dearth of 
commercially successful marine materials is especially unusual when we 
consider that the oceans, which cover nearly three quarters of the earth's 
surface, are home to an incredible multitude of biologically diverse life 
forms.  Science has identified close to 200,000 species of marine algae, 
animal bacteria, fungi and viruses.  It is thought that as many as four times 
this number have yet to be identified.  The marine environment under which 
these organisms live and propagate has endowed them with genetic and 
biochemical properties which are quite distinctive when compared to their 
terrestrial counterparts.  We have scarcely begun to explore this huge 
reservoir of biodiversity,  the commercial and scientific value of which is 
potentially enormous.<P> 

Thus, this report endeavors to give the reader an accurate bearing on the 
overall commercial potential which exists in our marine environment.  The 
primary objectives are:<P> 

<b>Marine Biopolymers</B><P>  

<UL><LI>To describe the marine biopolymer industry, its importance and its future
    prospects.<P>

<LI>To analyze the current and historical volume and value of  shipments of each
    commercially viable marine biopolymer in the major world market areas, i.e.
    Europe, North America, Japan and the rest of the world.<P>

<LI>To analyze the past and present markets for each type of biopolymer and 
    forecast the volume and value in each key geographic market through 1998.<P> 

<LI>To analyze the changes impacting this industry and assess the outcome.<P>
     
<LI>To describe manufacturing methods and economics for each biopolymer.<P>

<LI>To describe recent technological developments in marine biopolymers and the
    potential market consequences.<P>

<LI>To discuss the driving forces influencing demand.<P>

<LI>To analyze the end-use markets for each material and determine the past, 
    present and future share that each use represents.  To report on major 
    competitive factors influencing change.<P> 

<LI>To review exports, imports and apparent consumption for each material in 
    key geographic markets.<P>
         
<LI>To discuss regulatory and environmental issues and concerns.<P> 

<LI>To search patent and literature files to uncover and report on 
    significant new developments in the field.<P> 

<LI>To identify the key international manufacturers of each material and to 
    profile the most influential of these.<P></UL> 


<b>Products of Marine Biotechnology</B><P>
<UL><LI>To thoroughly investigate, on a worldwide basis,  research activities and
    commercial developments in the field.<P>

<LI>To identify and describe, through extensive patent and literature searches
    and through discussions with recognized experts in the field, novel marine
    products and  technologies which hold commercial promise.<P> 

<LI>To report on the current and potential market for those marine
    biomaterials which are now commercially available and to assess the
    market potential for promising products which have been identified and
    described but which are not yet being commercially pursued.<P>  

<LI>To identify those companies that are currently working or considering
    working on specific biomaterials or areas and their objectives.<P>

<LI>To discuss regulatory and environmental issues and concerns which impact
    the research, development and commercialization of promising products
    from marine biotechnology.<P> </UL>


<b>REASONS FOR THIS STUDY</B><P>


<b>Marine Biopolymers</B><P>

Among marine biopolymer producers, cost containment, modernized or new 
facilities and improved quality control measures have led to productivity 
gains and quality improvements across much of the industry; however, in all 
products but agarose, excess capacity has prevented the industry from seeing 
such efficiencies settle to the bottom line as improved profitability.  
Overcapacity is a vexing problem for the industry and only time and restraint 
on the part of producers and prospective producers will correct it.<P>  

The participants in this industry need to be acutely aware of these 
developments to intelligently plan for the future.  This report brings these 
factors into focus and provides manufacturers, distributors, users, and raw 
material suppliers with the knowledge needed to make informed decisions 
relating to investment, procurement or material selection.<P> 


<b>Products of Marine Biotechnology</B><P>

Extensive work has been undertaken in recent years to investigate the largely 
untapped source of useful chemical substances present in the marine 
environment.  The breadth of the work under way is vast,  as are the numbers 
of actual and potential commercial products.  By thoroughly researching 
literature, patent and other secondary sources and through discussions with 
major organizations, research institutions and universities, we have compiled 
an up-to-date listing and description of marine biomaterials that are either 
currently on the market or exhibit a clear potential for commercial 
development.  From this analysis we have made projections of volume and value, 
and have identified companies and organizations currently working on specific 
marine biochemical products or product categories.  This compilation and 
description will provide a valuable service to those wishing to capitalize on 
the extensive research and development work that has been conducted in this 
area.  The pharmaceutical, biotechnology and research communities in 
particular will benefit greatly from this up-to-date compilation and 
appraisal.<P> 


<b>CONTRIBUTIONS OF THIS STUDY AND FOR WHOM</B><P>

This report is intended to provide up-to-date international market information 
concerning the production, distribution, regulation, use and competitive 
environment surrounding the marine biopolymers agar, agarose, carrageenan, 
alginate and chitin/chitosan.  It is further intended to inform those 
companies and organizations interested in obtaining a current assessment of 
the status and potential of novel products from marine biotechnology.  

This report is an analysis and summation of interviews with hundreds of key 
industry officials, trade association representatives, consultants, users, and 
governmental personnel, as well as searches of patent and literature sources.<P>



<b>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

The scope of this report is worldwide.  In the biopolymer sector, North 
America, Europe, Japan and the "rest of the world" are analyzed and reported 
upon separately.  Because of its emerging status, we break out products of 
marine biotechnology into two categories, North America and the "rest of the 
world."<P>
    

With a changing world order and the emergence of major economic powers in the 
Far East, we believe it is important to make a brief statement about the 
geographic areas used in our analysis of marine biopolymer volume and value.  
In prior studies on the subject, the delineation of Western Europe has been 
straightforward.  With the coming apart of the Soviet Union, the situation is 
not nearly so clear.  Germany, for example, has essentially doubled in 
population with the incorporation of the former East Germany.  This change 
obviously must be considered when assessing the use and growth projections for 
marine biopolymers in Western Europe.<P>   

Many of the former East European countries, Poland, Hungary and Slovakia for 
example, are beginning to move out of their third world status.  In fact, the 
other former East Block countries represent a huge population and industrial 
base which is a growing consumer of certain marine biopolymers, most notably 
agar and alginates.  Also, Russia, the Ukraine, Georgia and the other now 
autonomous states of the former Soviet Union must ultimately be considered as  
geographically significant markets in studies such as this.  Quite frankly, 
the situation is too muddy and the data too difficult to uncover for us to 
take on this challenge. Thus, we have included usage of marine biopolymers by 
all states of the former Soviet Union under the "rest of the world" heading 
for purposes of this report.<P> 

Similarly, while we consider Japan to be an identifiable and quantifiable 
geographic market for this study, the huge and technologically sophisticated 
geographic market of the Western Pacific Rim is also considered to fall under 
the "rest of the world" category, as are Africa, South America, the countries 
of the Middle East and the Indian subcontinent.<P>  

Interestingly, in spite of their size,  these regions do not as yet contribute 
significantly to the consumption of marine biopolymers.<P> 


The report begins with an introductory chapter which is followed by separate 
sections covering Parts 1 and 2.  Each part includes a summary chapter 
followed by Industry Overview, Regulatory Issues, Shipment Trends, 
Technological Issues, International Issues, Industry Structure, and Profiles 
of Key Manufacturers.<P>  

<b>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

The extensive research capabilities of the BCC staff were accessed to analyze 
markets, consumption trends and supply and demand.  New technologies, market 
developments and present and future trends were identified through patent and 
literature searches and discussions with key industry sources.  Current 
regulatory and environmental issues were ascertained through discussion with 
industry sources, relevant regulatory agencies and literature searches.  
Manufacturing methods, process economics, international trade statistics and 
major influences on the industry were derived from discussions with a wide 
range of industry and government sources.<P> 


<b>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

The substance of this report is based on interviews with principal 
participants in the industry. Over 200 sources were contacted, including raw 
material suppliers, manufacturers of marine colloids and biomaterials, agents 
and distributors, consumers, and governmental agencies.<P>

<H3><I>INTRODUCTION</I></H3>
</CENTER>


<B>REASONS FOR STUDY, ITS CONTRIBUTION</B>

<P>Cytokines and growth factors  account for perhaps 70% of the protein drug 
research activity in the biotechnology industry today, and over 50% of the 
biotechnology-based pharmaceutical product sales. Discoveries have revealed 
the existence of new cytokines and growth factors, new biological behaviors 
about cytokines and growth factors are continually being uncovered, and the 
technologies for manufacturing cytokines and growth factors, though 
stabilizing, are undergoing important changes.</P> 

<P>Now that cytokines and growth factors have entered the market, the business 
issues affecting their sales can be meaningfully considered. Market 
applications for cytokines and growth factors are in flux: some already 
maturing, others offering expansion possibilities, and a few being 
disappointments.</P> 

<P>This group of biopharmaceuticals as a whole uniquely faces two great 
challenges. First, they tend to be more expensive than conventional drugs and 
therefore require economic justification in a healthcare climate that 
emphasizes pharmacoeconomics. Second, the prospect of entirely new 
technologies, such as gene therapy, cell and device implants, and chemical 
drugs for the stimulation of endogenous proteins, offers a future competitive 
challenge to cytokines and growth factors provided as exogenously 
administered, formulated drugs.</P> 

<P>In light of new developments, this study therefore  updates two earlier 
published studies on this subject. The aim is  to elucidate the future  of 
cytokines and growth factors in therapeutic applications in view of current 
developments. The major contribution of this study is a dispassionate, 
comprehensive analysis of cytokine and growth factor drugs from the business 
standpoint.</P> 




<B>OBJECTIVES AND GOALS OF STUDY</B>

<P>The objectives and goals of this study are the following:</P>

      <P>Sales analysis of cytokines and growth factors currently on the market, 
      by  products,  by applications, by geographic territories, by companies, 
      and by manufacturing technologies.</P>
  
      <P>Identification of cytokines and growth factors in the pipeline and  
      projections of actual (not merely the theoretical) sales if successful 
      in clinical trial and approved for marketing.</P>
 
      <P>Identification of newly discovered cytokines and growth factors and the  
      companies developing them.</P>
   
      <P>Elucidation of business and technical issues influencing the sales and 
      prospects of cytokines and growth factors.</P>
 
       <P>Forecast of C/GF sales in the year 2000.</P>


<B>REPORT AUDIENCE</B>

<P>Focused on business concerns rather than the science, this report will serve 
the interests of senior management executives in biotechnology firms and 
pharmaceutical companies.  It will also serve the interests of investment 
firms and anyone else who cares about the future of biopharmaceuticals as a 
business enterprise.  Scientists involved in cytokines and growth factors will 
also find this study of interest for its business perspective.</P> 


<B>SCOPE AND CONTENT OF REPORT</B>

<P>This report encompasses cytokines and growth factors for therapeutic use to 
treat human diseases.  Included are formulated cytokines and growth factors as 
well as cytokines and growth factors still under development or investigation, 
for dosed, therapeutic administration.</P> 

<P>This report excludes any detailed analysis of:  cytokines and growth factors 
as conditioning and proliferating agents for cell therapy; gene therapy based 
on the delivery of genes expressing cytokines and growth factors; chemical 
drugs for the endogenous stimulation of cytokines or growth factors; cytokines 
and growth factors as cell culture supplements; cytokines and growth factors 
for research applications; receptors to cytokines and growth factors for 
therapeutic or any other application; inhibitors or antagonists of cytokines 
and growth factors for therapeutic or any other use; immunoassays for 
cytokines and growth factors.</P> 

<P>This study is not simply a review of basic cytokine and growth factor research 
that just happens to take place in company laboratories. This is a business 
analysis of products being developed or already being marketed for therapeutic 
use, and this study is about their business prospects. For reviews of basic 
research, readers should consult the scientific literature.</P> 

<B>STUDY METHODOLOGY AND INFORMATION SOURCES</B>

<P>Sales data come from up-to-date company self-reporting and from BCC estimates 
based on telephone interviews with business executives and on computations 
derived from patient sizes, dosing and unit packaging prices. Product 
development information comes from company reports, medical literature, and 
patent searches.</P> 

<P>All sales data refer to formulated products at primary supplier level. 
Worldwide sales by product are presented,  then analyzed by medical 
application, geographic territory, company, and manufacturing technology. 
Figures are in millions of dollars ($MM, where one million dollars equals 
$106).  BCC also estimates by computation the minimum bulk protein 
requirements, in grams, for each cytokine and growth factor on the market, 
based on patient size and dosing for individual medical applications.  
Forecasts are in constant 1994 dollars to reflect changes without inflation. 
Sales projections incorporate a conservative model of market penetration for 
specific applications.</P> 

<P>All analyses are made independently, without the bias of vested interests. 
Mentions of products are not endorsements, and omissions, if any, are not 
intentional.  Medical judgments are left to physicians.</P>

</CENTER>

<B>OBJECTIVES AND GOALS OF THIS STUDY</B>

<P>The objectives of this study are to provide professional discussion, analysis 
and insight on the subject of genetic technologies and on enabling materials 
and ultimate applications.  The goals are to provide readers with an 
integration of technological and business perspectives and to provide useful 
information for the conduct of business activities.</P>  


<B>WHO BENEFITS FROM THIS STUDY</B>

<P>This report is written from the business perspective and readers will receive 
information useful for their business, product and market planning and 
development efforts.  We expect this study will be of interest both to support 
product suppliers and the practitioners of biotechnology.</P> 


<B>REASONS FOR STUDY AND ITS CONTRIBUTION</B>

<P>The revolution in genetic technology brought about in the 1970s with the 
invention of recombinant DNA techniques continues unabated, but already some 
platform technologies are showing signs of maturing while new ones are 
emerging.</P> 

<P>The genetic technology industry itself is undergoing significant changes, as 
financial constraints and business competition place new selective pressures 
on companies which, in effect, "choose" those firms best adapted to survive 
the changed and challenged environment.</P> 

<P>This study therefore is written to provide up-to-date information and analysis 
of interest to both the suppliers of genetic technology enabling materials and 
the practitioners of genetic technology, with emphasis on the business  
aspects since we assume readers already have familiarity with the science. A 
key feature of this study is its quantifying of enabling materials sales in 
each of the genetic technology platforms. Forecasts are rational, and 
explained.</P>  


<B>SCOPE AND CONTENT OF THIS STUDY</B>

<P>This study focuses on the enabling materials for genetic technology, 
particularly the materials directly involved in genetic manipulation. Genetic 
technologies covered in this study are evident in the table of contents.</P> 

<P>Excluded  from this study are materials for the extraction and purification of 
genetic material, materials for gel electrophoresis, media for propagation, 
materials for screening, materials for protein synthesis and sequencing, 
immunoassay reagents, and materials of a general laboratory nature. This study 
also excludes durable equipment and instruments, small supplies and consumable 
supplies.</P> 


<B>METHODOLOGY AND INFORMATION SOURCES</B>

<P>Primary information on sales and other technical and business matters was 
obtained from telephone interviews with many product suppliers. We also 
interviewed practitioners of the various genetic technologies, who constitute 
customers for the materials.  Secondary sources of information included 
several science texts (see Appendix) and articles in professional journals. We 
also made use of in-house computerized literature search capability.</P> 

<P>Sales are presented in millions of dollars ($ MM), where one million = 106.  
The report generally provides worldwide sales estimates; exceptions are noted. 
Forecasts to 2000 are given in constant 1995 dollars to reflect real changes 
without inflation.  The average annual growth rate (AAGR, %) is a compounded 
figure derived from tables of net present value.</P> 

<P>All analyses are made independently, without the bias of vested interests.  
Mentions of products and companies are not endorsements and omissions, if any, 
are not intentional.</P> 


<B>ANALYST CREDENTIALS</B>

<P>The preparer of this study is a biochemist who also has an MBA degree. He has 
both academic and industry experience extending many years. At BCC, he has 
written numerous studies on biotechnology subjects. He also has provided 
confidential consulting to single clients, which has included repeat business. 
He is the editor of Applied Genetics News and Stereochemical Technology News 
and is the organizer of BCC's biotechnology conferences.</P> 


<B>RELATED BCC STUDIES</B>

<B>OBJECTIVES AND GOALS OF THIS STUDY</B><P>

The principal objective of this study is to communicate facts, data and  technical information
relevant to a business understanding of enzyme inhibitors and receptor blockers, especially from
the strategic perspective. The goal of the study is to have it be a meaningful guide for companies
pursuing commercial developments in this field.<P> 


<B>REASONS FOR STUDY AND ITS CONTRIBUTION</B><P>

Many drugs work by exerting physiological effects, i.e. by causing events to happen. On the other
hand, a significant number of drugs work by preventing physiological effects, i.e. by causing
events not to happen.  These kinds of substances are the therapeutic enzyme 
inhibitors and receptor blockers.<P>

In the past, many of the inhibitors and blockers were developed hit or miss, and without 
necessarily knowing precisely how they worked. Now, research is providing insights as to 
how these "old" drugs in fact work, leading to potential improvements in existing drug 
categories. Furthermore, biomedical research in biotechnology companies and academia is 
revealing new biological targets for possible therapeutic intervention with entirely new 
classes of inhibitors and blockers.<P> 

Efforts commonly described as "small-molecule research" and "drug discovery research" 
generally involve the kinds of substances taken up in this study.  A large fraction of the 
biotechnology industry in fact deals with the development of therapeutic inhibitors and 
blockers.<P> 




Another new development concerns new technologies for finding and making therapeutic 
enzyme inhibitor and receptor blocker molecules. These new technologies include 
combinatorial chemistry, high-throughput screening, rational drug design, and chiral 
technology.<P>


<B>AUDIENCE FOR THIS REPORT</B><P>

This report should be of interest and value to pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology 
companies seeking to keep up with commercial developments in this field, as well as to 
combinatorial chemistry companies, chirotechnology companies and drug discovery 
companies.  We also believe that investors who may be overlooking significant but under-
publicized activities will find this report worth reading. Anyone who has invested, or is 
thinking about investing in inhibitor and blocker research and development ought to consider the
sales and potential future sales of their products, which analysis this study provides.<P> 


<B>SCOPE AND CONTENT OF STUDY</B><P>

Included in this study are enzyme inhibitors and receptor blockers already available, or 
intended for, therapeutic use. We include a world perspective on inhibitors and blockers 
curently available and those being investigated or under development for such use. <P>

Excluded from this study are discussions of the kinds of inhibitors and blockers that serve use in
basic research, i.e. those used for investigations aimed at elucidating the binding sites or
mechanistic behavior of enzymes and receptors, although an Appendix lists many of these
substances.<P> 

This study excludes discussion or sales analysis of therapeutic antibiotics and agricultural 
pesticides, even though a large percentage of them act as either inhibitors or blockers. An 
Appendix briefly mentions a few of the antibiotics.<P>

Also excluded from this study: receptor agonists, antisense molecules and therapeutic 
enzymes.<P>  

Readers should note that this study emphasizes the commercial aspects of enzyme inhibitors and
receptor blockers and their practical medical applications. Although this study discusses some of
the relevant basic research, this study does not constitute a roundup or comprehensive review of
basic scientific research merely happening to take place in company settings.<P> 

This is not a sales audit report of the kind that certain well-known pharmaceutical databases 
already provide: we are not providing explicit, comprehensive past-year brand and dosage 
form sales. This is instead a strategic level,  forward-looking "new developments" report 
particularly oriented toward forecasting.<P> 


<B>STUDY METHODOLOGY</B><P>

Primary information for this study comes from telephone interviews with business managers or
head scientists, depending on the relevancy. Secondary sources of information encompass
available company literature, scientific journals, medical literature and the trade press.<P> 

Sales are presented in millions of dollars ($ MM), where one million = 106. All figures refer to
worldwide sales unless indicated otherwise. Sales figures refer to the total for the compound or
compound category: we aggregate all dosage forms and strengths of a compound into a single
figure. Forecasts are made to the year 2000 and are expressed in constant 1995 dollars to reflect
real changes without inflation.  The average annual growth rate percentage (AAGR%) is a
compounded figure derived from tables of net present value.<P> 

All analyses are made independently, without the bias of vested interests. Mentions of 
products and companies are not endorsements, and omissions, if any, are not intentional.<P> 


<B>ANALYST CREDENTIALS</B><P>

The analyst of this study is a chemist and biochemist who also has an M.B.A. degree.  Having
both academic and industrial laboratory research experience at senior levels, he has been writing
technical-business studies at BCC for 13 years and serves as its biotechnology 
director.  He is editor of both Applied Genetics News  and Stereochemical Technology News  and
is the organizer of BCC's conferences on commercial biotechnology.<P>

<B>INDUSTRY OVERVIEW</B><P>

Electrochemical cells, generically known as batteries, are
used to save and transport electrical energy.  These
functions -- power storage and power portability -- make
batteries essential to today's industrial and consumer-
oriented society.  Although simple batteries have existed
for at least 200 years, the battery industry traces its
roots to the early 1900s.  At that time, the
commercialization of automobiles and radios created a demand
for automotive (starting, lighting, ignition and generator)
batteries and portable appliance batteries.  These markets,
characterized by primary (disposable) and secondary
(rechargeable) batteries, remain the two areas where most
batteries are consumed.  Automotive batteries are a distinct
secondary battery market subsector.<P>

As such, most of the battery industry is considered mature,
with demand closely related to the sales of either
automobiles or various consumer products.  Unlike many
mature industries, battery demand is also related to service
life, and hence, replacement sales.  Even rechargeable
secondary batteries must eventually be discarded and
replaced.  In many applications, replacement sales are the
driving force in market growth.<P>

On the other hand, there are areas where the battery
industry could experience the explosive growth usually
associated with juvenile industries.  Portable computers,
computer memory preservation, mobile telephones and portable
video cameras didn't exist as well-developed markets 15
years ago.  Now, these battery-using products are
commonplace.  Electric vehicles, utility load leveling, and
remote power storage stations represent an underdeveloped
role for batteries and potential new markets.  Advances in
battery technology promise to increase battery power
density, service and cycle life.  Lithium-containing and
nickel-hydrogen (including nickel metal-hydride) batteries
were a specialized niche 10 years ago.  Now, they are
available to the general consumer and are displacing a
number of existing battery technologies.  Further down the
road, developmental systems like conductive polymer, sodium-
sulfur, redox and others could allow unprecedented battery
configuration and performance.  These two developments, new
markets and improved performance will help batteries replace
more conventional power sources (internal combustion
engines, utility AC power, etc.).<P>

The goal of battery designers is a portable accumulator that
stores large amounts of electricity for long periods of
time, allows repeated charge-discharge cycles and is
inexpensive.  The question is no longer if these goals can
be met.  Today's research is directed towards improving
these criteria to performance levels heretofore considered
impossible.<P>

<B>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P>

Battery technical advances and a realignment of the battery
industry players must be matched by new marketing attitudes.
Competing manufacturers and suppliers must be identified.
Batteries must be matched with appliance requirements.  New
battery performance requires new appliance designs.
Material requirements necessary for a new generation of
batteries must be identified.  Reliable supplies of these
materials must be secured.  Competing technology, including
both non-battery systems and new battery systems, threaten
existing kinds of batteries.  Is it better to abandon
outmoded technology, replace it with new technology, or get
out of the battery business altogether?  What is the extent
of existing technology and markets?  This BCC document
addresses these problems.<P>

<H3><I>INTRODUCTION</I></H3>
</CENTER>

Diamond possess the greatest hardness and greatest thermal
conductivity among all known materials. Combined with these important
properties, diamond has very low thermal expansion and high electrical
resistance. Because of its hardness, diamond is far more effective and
efficient than other competing materials used for abrasive, cutting,
shaping or finishing tools.<P>

Industrial diamond is either tailor-made synthetic diamond, or natural
diamond that does not meet the standards of gem diamond because of its
color, size or some other imperfection. Synthetic diamond was first
synthesized by J.B. Hannay in 1880 by heating bone oil, lithium, and
hydrocarbons in sealed iron tubes at a red heat.<P>

The diamond and  CBN material industry interfaces directly with the
heavy, automotive, construction and stone cutting industries through
the widespread use of diamond and CBN products for grinding, cutting,
polishing and finishing operations. The industry is characterized by
different production technologies, from high-temperature,
high-pressure synthesis for diamond and cubic boron nitride to plasma
CVD for diamond and CBN films and coatings. The diamond and CBN
product technologies are characterized by different forming methods
such as electroplated, resin- and metal-bonded and vitrified products.
Brazing technologies are also adopted for single crystal or
polycrystalline products.<P>

Several segments of the diamond and CBN industry are characterized by
rapid innovations and technological changes. Composed of a wide
variety of products, the industrial diamond and CBN materials and
products industry is in the midst of booming sales and growth.<P>

There has been an explosion of interest in diamond, diamond-like and
CBN films and coatings. These films are expected to be used in a
variety of applications from cutting tools to wear-resistant parts,
and from electronics to optical applications. One advantage of CVD
diamond technology over the high-pressure technology is its low cost.<P>

<B>STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

This BCC report has been prepared because a lot of new developments
have been taking place in the industrial diamond and CBN materials and
products. Some of the market segments are matured while others are
growing at very fast rates. Secondly, there have been new developments
in materials, processing and applications in the areas of diamond and
CBN materials and their products, including films and coatings. These
have contributed a need to make a proper analysis of the technological
and business issues, trends in manufacturing as well as foreign
competition. Thirdly, the trend toward high performance materials and
technologies necessitates high performance tools and devices in which
diamond and CBN materials play major roles.<P>

This report has been prepared with the following objectives:<P>

<LI>To provide an overview of the various industrial diamond and CBN
materials, films and products, their production technologies and
applications.<P>

<LI>To identify the technological and business issues related to the
commercial production of diamond and CBN materials, PCD and PCBN
blanks, and diamond, diamond-like and CBN films.<P>

<LI>To identify the technological and business issues related to the
commercial production of diamond, CBN, PCD and PCBN products.<P>

<LI>To understand the inter-material competition among the various
diamond, CBN, PCD, PCBN and diamond and CBN coated products.<P>

<LI>To identify the technological and business issues related to the
development and commercial production of diamond, diamond-like, and
CBN films and coated products.<P>

<LI>To analyze the domestic and foreign competition among companies within
each of the diamond and CBN materials, PCD and PCBN blanks, diamond
and diamond-like films, and their product market segments.<P>

<LI>To determine the current size and future growth of the U.S. markets
for diamond and CBN materials, films and products.<P>

<LI>To determine the current size of the world markets for diamond and CBN
materials, films and products.<P>

<LI>To identify and profile all U.S. producers, suppliers and users of
diamond, CBN, PCD, PCBN materials.<P>

<LI>To identify and profile all U.S. producers and suppliers of diamond,
CBN, PCD and PCBN products.<P>

<LI>To identify and profile all U.S. producers and those involved in the
development of diamond, diamond-like and CBN films and products.<P>

<LI>To identify the foreign companies involved in the diamond and CBN
materials, films and products.<P>

<B>CONTRIBUTION TO THE STUDY</B><P>

BCC's technical/economic study covers the technical and industry
overviews, materials, current and emerging production methods, new
developments in materials and processing techniques, business and
development issues, current and emerging applications and an extensive
market analysis. Current size and future growth of the U.S. markets
are estimated for 1990, 1991 and 1996. Estimation is also made on the
current world markets.<P>

<B>FORMAT AND SCOPE</B><P>

For each material segment, the report provides an analysis of material
and products, types in that category, processing technologies,
properties, applications, new developments, the U.S. markets and
patent analysis.<P>

The qualitative and quantitative judgments embodied in this report are
a valuable contribution to the current knowledge of diamond and CBN
materials and products, their manufacturing technologies, applications
and markets. Moreover, this study has been conducted at a vital stage
when diamond and CBN products are increasing their share of the
markets from competing products. However, there are domestic as well
as foreign competitions not only for the raw products but also for the
final products. With these new developments, decisions are to be made
by a number of companies as to their future strategies of involvement.<P>

<B>METHODOLOGY AND INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

The findings of this report are based on information derived from
interviews with almost all producers, potential producers and
suppliers of diamond and CBN materials and their products. Several
industry experts were also contacted for this study. In addition, many
end-users were contacted to evaluate the current and future demands
for these materials. In all, about 300 persons from 250 companies were
contacted for this study.<P>

Secondary data were obtained from industry associations such as
Diamond Wheel Manufacturers Institute, Grinding Wheel Institute,
Society of Manufacturing Engineers, Abrasive Manufacturers Institute,
Abrasive Engineering Society, Industrial Diamond Association of
America; trade publications; technical journals; government statistics
such as from the U.S. Department of Interior (Bureau of Mines), U.S.
Dept. of Commerce (Bureau of Census); and U.S. Patent Database, NTIS
and Dialog computer searches.<P>

<H3><I>INTRODUCTION</I></H3>
</CENTER>

Advanced materials and particularly advanced ceramics will play an important
role in the future of the U.S. economy. The development and use of advanced
ceramics are revolutionizing the field of material science and technology.
Dramatic changes are taking place in the way materials are used and made. The
result of this foment is the improved performance of existing products and the
birth of new technologies.<P>

Advanced ceramic materials constitute an emerging technology with a very broad
base of current and potential applications and an ever growing list of
material compositions. Indeed, there are several new applications for advanced
ceramics which were anticipated.<P>

Advanced ceramics encompass a variety of materials, markets, and applications.
For structural applications, materials include: Sialon, silicon carbide,
silicon nitride, zirconias, oxides and aluminas. In the broad category of
advanced ceramics, advanced structural ceramics constitute those materials
which are used for high performance applications where a combination of
properties such as wear resistance, hardness, stiffness, corrosion resistance
and low density are important. In addition to these properties, advanced
structural ceramics have relatively high mechanical strength at high
temperatures. Electronic ceramics utilize their functional characteristics and
encompass a range of materials, from simple oxides and nitrides to complex
compounds.<P>

Ceramic powder is a necessary ingredient for most of the structural ceramics,
ceramic composites, electronic ceramics and ceramic coatings. The ceramic
powders used most are oxides, carbides, nitrides and borides.  New
technologies are emerging for the production of ultra pure ceramic powders.
These new developments have helped to improve the quality of ceramic
components. The impact of these new developments will be felt as the advanced
ceramic industry scales up manufacturing processes and the powders produced by
the new processes become competitive with those produced by established
techniques.<P>

<B>STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

Although the advanced ceramics markets and, in particular, the structural
ceramics market had been projected to grow very rapidly in the 1980s, this
rapid growth did not occur. The "Ceramics Fever" of the early and mid-1980's
has gone and a new reality is felt by suppliers of advanced ceramic
components. Also certain defense programs which would have used advanced
ceramics have been shelved for the time being because of the massive cuts in
the military. Also certain ceramic market segments have been losing ground
because of  the emergence of newer technologies that render ceramic components
obsolete.  However, several industrial segments such as cutting tools, wear
parts, bioceramics and ceramic coatings have been growing.<P>

Electronic ceramics constitutes a mature market with some of its segments
growing while others are at a stand still. The new high temperature ceramic
superconductor offers a very good future potential market.<P>

The recession in the last three years has severely affected certain segments
of the advanced ceramics industry such as structural ceramics and, in a
limited way, the ceramics coating business. However, electronic ceramics has
not been much affected by the current recession because of the larger growth
of the electronics industry.<P>

Acquisitions and joint ventures are increasingly taking place in the advanced
ceramics industry. Japanese and European companies have also entered the U.S.
market by setting up their own subsidiaries or through acquisitions and joint
ventures.<P>

Business Communications Co., Inc. has been keeping track of all these
industry developments mentioned above. BCC had earlier published a report
"Advanced Ceramics - A Technical Economic Study," in 1985 and another report,
"A Complete Guide to U.S. Advanced Ceramics Industry," in 1990. In addition to
these, BCC had published over half a dozen reports in advanced ceramic areas,
such as advanced structural ceramics, electronic ceramics, ceramic matrix
composites, ceramic powders, high-performance ceramic coatings, ceramic wear
parts, ceramic magnets and piezoelectric ceramics. With this massive volume of
data available, we felt the need to pool all the information in advanced
ceramics we have acquired so far.<P>

Since our last study in 1990, major changes have occurred in the industry
structure of the U.S. advanced  ceramic industry, including the acquisition of
several U.S. companies by foreign companies. With all these changes, we at BCC
felt that a detailed analysis should be carried out for each segment.<P>

This report has been prepared with the following objectives:<P>

<UL>- To provide an industry overview of structural ceramics, ceramic coatings
and electronic ceramics.<P>

   - To determine the current size and future growth of the U.S. markets for
structural ceramics, ceramic composites, electronic ceramics and ceramic
coatings.<P>

   - To provide a technology overview, including material types, properties
and applications for structural  ceramics (monolithic and ceramic composites),
electronic ceramics and ceramic coatings.<P>

   - To review the technological developments, both in the U.S. and overseas,
as well as the recent patents in structural ceramics, electronic ceramics and
ceramic coatings.<P>

   - To analyze the domestic and foreign competition among companies within
each of the advanced ceramic market segments.<P>

   - To identify and profile all U.S. companies and institutions involved in
advanced ceramics.<P>

   - To analyze the acquisitions, mergers, joint ventures and licensing
agreements in the U.S.advanced ceramics industry.<P>

   - To categorize all U.S. companies according to their involvement in the
various market segments.</UL><P>


<B>CONTRIBUTION TO THE STUDY</B><P>

The new BCC study provides an in-depth analysis of the technological
advancements, new applications, economics, current markets and trends, and the
players in the advanced ceramic industry. Forecasts for each segment are
provided to the year 2000.  Profiles of all U.S. companies and institutions
involved in advanced ceramics as suppliers, users, and researchers are
presented. In depth analyses have been provided for the U.S. advanced ceramic
industry structure, providing detailed information on acquisitions, mergers,
joint ventures and licensing agreements.<P>

Through this report we hope to provide a better understanding of the U.S.
advanced ceramics industry, including current markets, market potential and
players. This study provides the most up-to-date information on U.S. companies
in advanced ceramics.<P>

<B>FORMAT AND SCOPE</B><P>

This BCC study has been conducted with a global perspective in terms of
technology development and its applications. The market projections have  been
calculated for the U.S. only. However, Japanese and European companies are
positioning themselves to take niches of the U.S. advanced ceramics market.
Therefore, we present a detailed analysis of foreign acquisitions, mergers and
licensing agreements occurring in the ceramics industry.<P>

The report provides business planners and managers with an improved
understanding of the direction and impact of advanced ceramics technology, and
how markets will be  affected and opportunities created.<P>

The comprehensive report contains:<P>

<UL>*  An overview of materials for advanced ceramics, their properties, new
         developments, and recent patents<P>

      *  Current and potential uses for advanced ceramics<P>

      *  An analysis of major advances in advanced ceramics technology<P>

      *  Sales projections for advanced ceramics in all the major applications<P>

      *  Detailed profiles of industry players as well as their product lines
         and new product developments<P>

      *  A review of the economic/market opportunities for current industry
         participants and new entrants</UL><P>

We feel, therefore, that the qualitative and quantitative judgements embodied
in this report are a valuable contribution to the current knowledge of
advanced ceramics. Moreover, we are making this contribution at a vital stage
when drastic changes are occurring in the U.S. advanced ceramics industry.<P>

<B>METHODOLOGY AND INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

Information for this report was collected through extensive industry contacts
with people active in the research, development, production and use of
advanced ceramic components, from government and academic sources active in
research and development, and by reference to the technical literature.
Several industry experts were also interviewed for this study. In addition,
many end-users were contacted to evaluate the current and future demands for
these materials.<P>

Over 300 U.S. companies assisted BCC in identifying and updating new material
developments and their applications as well as the markets. A thorough
computer patent database search was conducted in addition to consulting
several NTIS published searches to evaluate new developments. New developments
and company news appearing in the BCC newsletter, High Tech Ceramics News have
also been included in this report. All the major technical and trade
publications and conference proceedings were also used  for this study.<P>

</CENTER>

<B>STUDY GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</B>


<P>Advanced ceramic materials constitute an emerging technology with a very broad 
base of current and potential applications and an ever growing list of 
material compositions. Advanced ceramics are inorganic, nonmetallic materials 
with combinations of fine-scale microstructures, purity, complex compositions 
and crystal structures, and accurately controlled additives.  Such materials 
require a level of processing science and engineering far beyond that used in 
making conventional ceramics. These new generations of high-performance 
materials hold promise of markets in the billions of dollars by the end of the 
century. Collectively, they represent an enabling technology, the development 
of which is critical to advances in a host of high-technology applications, 
ranging from modern microelectronics to futuristic auto engines and 
superconductors.</P> 

<P>The outstanding properties possessed by advanced ceramics are achieved through 
special compositions and microstructures that require very careful control 
throughout the successive stages of ceramic processing. These stages are: 
powder synthesis, powder sizing, rheology control, consolidation and forming 
processes, sintering, final machining and inspection.</P> 

<P>Ceramic powder is a necessary ingredient for most of the structural ceramics, 
ceramic composites, electronic ceramics and ceramic coatings. For most 
advanced ceramic components, starting powder is a crucial factor. The 
performance characteristics of a ceramic component are greatly influenced by 
precursor powder characteristics. Among the most important are the powderœs 
chemical purity, particle size distribution and the manner in which the 
powders are packed in the green body before sintering.</P> 

<P>Powders of narrow size distribution can be compacted into ordered arrays and, 
when in the submicron region, these powders are sinter at reduced 
temperatures. Consequently, in the processing of advanced ceramics, there is a 
growing need to develop synthetic techniques capable of producing submicron, 
chemically pure powders with a narrow size distribution. However, the cost is 
again the factor since the new synthetic processing techniques are 
comparatively more expensive than the currently established powder 
manufacturing methods.</P> 


<B>STUDY GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</B>

<P>Since BCC published of a report entitled "Advanced Ceramic Powders" in 1990, 
several new developments have taken place. One important development is the 
availability of nano-sized ceramic powders. BCC has updated this report since 
advanced ceramic powders still constitute the most important ingredient for 
making ceramic components for structural and electronic applications as well 
as for thermal spray ceramic coatings. These three application areas for 
advanced ceramics constitute a global market in the billions of dollars. Also, 
in the last few years, several new powder synthesis techniques have been 
developed as alternatives to established methods. All this has created a need 
for an analysis of the technological and business issues, new developments and 
the trends in ceramic powder production.</P> 

<P>This report has been prepared with the following objectives:</P>

<UL>
<LI>To provide an overview of the various advanced ceramic powders, their
  production technologies and applications.
<LI>To identify the technological and business issues related to the commercial
  production and use of  advanced ceramic powders.
<LI>To analyze the domestic and foreign competition among companies within
  each of the advanced ceramic powder segments.
<LI>To determine the current size and future growth of the markets for oxide,
  carbide, nitride and boride ceramic powders.
<LI>To determine the current size and future growth of the markets for nano-sized
  ceramic powders.
<LI>To identify and profile all U.S. producers of advanced ceramic powders.
<LI>To identify all users of advanced ceramic powders in the U.S.
<LI>To identify the U.S. companies that are currently conducting research and
  development in advanced ceramic powders as well as their areas of research.
<LI>To review important patents in the oxide, carbide, nitride, boride and
  nano-sized advanced ceramic powders.
</UL>

<B>CONTRIBUTION TO THE STUDY</B>

<P>BCCœs technical/economic study covers the markets, materials, synthesis 
techniques, current and emerging production methods, new developments in 
synthesis, current and emerging applications and a market analysis. Current 
size and future growth of the markets are estimated for the period 1993 to 
2000. The report analyzes the competitive environment within each of the 
markets for oxide, carbide, nitride, boride and nano-sized ceramic powders. 
The report profiles all U.S. companies involved in the production of advanced 
ceramic powders.</P> 

<P>Since our last study on advanced ceramic powder, we have included some of the 
smaller market segments such as beryllia, titanium diboride and boron nitride. 
Since nano-sized powder has become an important new development, we have 
carried an extensive technology and market analyses as well as the industry 
structure of this new material.</P> 


<B>FORMAT AND SCOPE</B>

<P>For each ceramic powder type, the report provides an analysis of material 
types in that category, processing technologies, properties, applications, new 
developments in the U.S., Europe and Japan, recent important patents worth 
looking into for commercialization, prices for each powder type and U.S. 
markets according to applications and powder types. A technology review has 
been conducted on the current and emerging ceramic powder production 
technologies such as carbothermal reduction, vapor-phase reaction, plasma 
processes, sol-gel techniques, chemical techniques such as precipitation, 
hydrothermal process, emulsion process, laser synthesis and self-propagating 
high temperature synthesis (SHS). Nano-sized powders have been treated in a 
separate chapter since many nano-sized powder synthesis technologies are 
common to different ceramic powders.</P> 

<P>The qualitative and quantitative judgments embodied in this report are a 
valuable contribution to the current knowledge of advanced ceramic powders and 
nano-sized ceramic powders, their processing techniques, applications and 
markets. Moreover, this study has been conducted at a vital stage in the

<H3><I>INTRODUCTION</I></H3>
</CENTER>

Advanced ceramic materials are an emerging technology with a very broad base
of current and potential applications, and an ever growing list of material
compositions. The promise of performance improvements is the main force
driving the development and commercialization of advanced ceramic materials.
The appeal of advanced ceramics in various applications is due to a
combination of excellent properties such as wear resistance, hardness,
stiffness, corrosion resistance and relatively low density. A major attraction
of ceramics is its relatively high mechanical strength at high temperatures.<P>

Among the family of advanced ceramic materials, ceramic composites will find
wider applications when increased toughness, due to fiber or whisker-
reinforcements, is combined with the inherent refractory properties of the
ceramic materials. Its development will allow the use of ceramics at
temperatures beyond the temperature limits for metals, but without the
familiar brittle fracture of conventional ceramics.<P>

Various types of new advanced ceramic matrix composites are now emerging from
the laboratories, and are undergoing field tests. Their manufacture is usually
based on new findings obtained in connection with the advances in various
fields of science and technology.<P>

A few of the particulate-toughened ceramics, such as the zirconia-toughened
ceramics, are filling applications such as bearings, bushings, precision
balls, valve seats and die inserts where their friction and wear
characteristics have improved both performance and cost. Similarly,
particulate-toughened as well as whisker-reinforced alumina have found use as
cutting tool inserts, replacing carbide and metal tool inserts. For space
shuttle tiles which require a good combination of strength, thermal stability
and low density, the material of choice is silica or a combination of silica
and other ceramic fiber-reinforced ceramic composites.<P>

<B>STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

BCC had conducted a technical economic study on ceramic matrix composites in
1988. Since then several new developments have taken place. The various
ceramic matrix composite materials, along with their mechanical and high
temperature properties, are examined in this report from scientific and
applications points of view. There are, however, certain technical and
economic issues that remain to be solved. These include such problems as
stringent processing requirements, high cost and competition from some of the
new metal alloys and intermetallics which could withstand temperatures as high
as 1000(C. This report has been prepared with the following objectives:<P>


To provide an overview of materials for ceramic matrix composites, their
processing, new developments and recent patents.<P>

To review the current and potential uses for ceramic matrix composites,
including details of product applications in areas such as cutting tools, wear
resistant parts, engines, aerospace and defense-related, high temperature and
energy-related.<P>

To update major advances in ceramic composite technology.<P>

To determine the current size and future market growth for ceramic matrix
composites according to material types and applications.<P>

To review the U.S. ceramic matrix composite industry structure and foreign
competition.<P>

To identify and profile all U.S. producers and users of ceramic matrix
composites.<P>

To review the economic/market opportunities for current industry participants
and new entrants.<P>

<B>CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE STUDY</B><P>

The new BCC report provides an in-depth analysis of the technological
advancements in ceramic composite materials, and their processing, new
applications, economics, current markets and trends, domestic and foreign
competition and players. Forecasts for each material type and application
segment are provided to the year 2000. Profiles of all U.S. companies and
institutions involved in ceramic matrix composites as suppliers of raw
materials, processors, users and researchers are presented.<P>

<B>FORMAT AND SCOPE</B><P>

The dimensions of the current and future markets for advanced structural
ceramics have been explored by several market researchers, including BCC and a
few government agencies. However, this business opportunity report represents
the most complete technical, economic and marketing document on this subject,
and is designed to provide valuable information for manufacturers and end
users alike.<P>

Finally, the BCC study has been conducted with a global perspective in terms
of technology development and its applications. The market study has been
limited to the U.S. only. Since the Japanese and European companies are
positioning themselves to take niches of the U.S. advanced ceramics market, we
have included foreign players and the competition they pose to the U.S.
companies for each ceramic composite market segment. The report provides
business planners and managers with an improved understanding of the direction
and impact of ceramic composite materials technology, and how markets will be
affected and opportunities created.<P>

The qualitative and quantitative judgements embodied in this report are a
valuable contribution to the current knowledge of ceramic matrix composites.<P>

Moreover, this study has been conducted at a vital stage in the development of
this growing industry, where decisions are to be made by a number of companies
as to their strategies of involvement and expansion as well as whether to
enter new areas of business.<P>

<B>METHODOLOGY AND INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

Information for this report was collected through extensive industry contacts
with persons active in the development, production and use of ceramic fibers,
whiskers and ceramic matrix composites, from government and academic sources
active in research and development, and by reference to the technical
literature.<P>

Over 100 U.S. companies were contacted for this study to identify various
applications and to update the developments in ceramic matrix materials and
processing technologies. A thorough computer search was conducted in addition
to consulting several NTIS published searches. All the major technical and
trade publications and recent conference proceedings were reviewed for this
study.<P>

<B>STUDY GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

Sol gel processing is a chemically based, low temperature method that can 
produce ceramics and glasses with better purity and homogeneity than high 
temperature conventional processes.  It has been used to produce a wide range 
of compositions in various forms, including powders, fibers, coatings and thin 
films, monoliths, and porous membranes.  Inorganic/organic hybrids, where a 
gel (usually silica) is impregnated with polymers to provide specific 
properties, can also be made.  One of the most attractive features of the sol 
gel process is the capability to produce compositions not possible with 
conventional methods.<P> 

The applications for sol gel-derived products are numerous. Powders and thin 
films can be used for electronic, optical, and electro-optic components and 
devices, such as substrates, capacitors, memory devices, IR detectors, and 
waveguides.  Both optical and refractory fibers are used for fiber optic 
sensors and thermal insulation, respectively.  Antireflection coatings are 
also used for automotive and architectural applications. Glass monoliths and 
inorganic/organic hybrids are under development for lenses, mirror substrates, 
graded index optics, optical filters, sensors, passive and nonlinear active 
waveguides, and lasers.  Membranes for separation and filtration processes 
also are being investigated.<P> 

A previous BCC report, published in 1988, discussed potential markets and 
applications.  Though many of these are still the same and some have reached 
or are near commercialization, an update was determined necessary due to the  
changes in the advanced ceramics and materials industries, as discussed below.<P>  


<b>STUDY GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

This BCC report has been prepared in an effort to update the status and 
markets for sol gel technology discussed in the previous report published in 
1988.  Since that report, major changes have occurred in the industries that 
use such sol gel-derived applications.  For instance, the defense industry has 
undergone significant downsizing, which has had a significant impact on 
government funding for advanced materials.  The advanced ceramics industry has 
also undergone a major restructuring, with mergers, acquisitions, and 
takeovers by foreign companies.  Despite these trends, interest in sol gel 
processing has remained strong, with an increase in published papers 
(including a journal devoted to the topic), conferences, and patents.  Because 
new developments have continued, an updated analysis of the technology and 
markets was needed.<P> 

This report has been prepared with the following objectives:<P>

<LI>    To provide an overview of the various commercial products
          made with the sol gel process and their applications.<P>

<LI>   To identify the technological and business issues related
          to the development and commercial production of sol
          gel-derived products.<P>

<LI>   To analyze the domestic and foreign competition among
          companies involved with sol gel products and competing
          products.<P>

<LI>    To determine the current size and future growth of the
          total U.S. and worldwide markets for sol gel products and
          applications.<P>

<LI>    To identify and profile all U.S. organizations involved
          in the development and commercialization of sol gel
          derived products.<P>

<LI>    To identify the foreign companies, universities, and
          other institutions involved in  the development and
          commercialization of sol gel-derived products.<P>


<b>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY</B><P>

BCC's technical/economic study covers the technical and industry overviews, 
current and emerging products and applications, new developments, business and 
development issues, and an extensive market analysis, including foreign 
competition.  The total market for the U.S. and global markets has been 
estimated for 1994 and 1999.<P> 


<b>FORMAT AND SCOPE</B><P>

The report provides a detailed technology overview for sol gel-derived 
products, including processing methods, properties, and applications.  New 
developments in the U.S. and outside the U.S. have been included.  Detailed 
patent analyses have been carried out for each application.  Finally, market 
analyses have been provided for each application segment for the U.S.<P>  


<b>METHODOLOGY AND INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

The conclusions of this report are based on information derived from 
interviews with experts in the field, including those in industry and 
academia.  A survey was also mailed to about 100 persons involved with sol 
gel, and those that returned the survey were contacted for further details.  
Extensive literature and patent searches were conducted to obtain an overall 
assessment of the technology.  Other information was obtained from trade 
publications, technical journals, the Department of Commerce, and trade 
associations.  In all, about 150 persons from over 100 companies, 
universities, and other institutions were contacted for this study.<P>

<B>STUDY GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</B>

<P>The electronic ceramics industry is a high technology industry characterized 
by rapid innovation and technological change. Composed of a wide variety of 
functionally different materials, the electronic ceramic industry is still in 
the midst of a strong expansion and redirection. It interfaces directly with 
the electronics industry through the widespread use of ceramic components as 
an integral part of electronic devices and packages. Several of the electronic 
ceramic market segments are mature but growing steadily. A few of the markets 
range from the concepts being tested in research and development laboratories 
to healthy emerging industries.</P> 

<P>Electronic ceramics provide basic components in the support of a variety of 
electronic products including computers, industrial controls, consumer 
automotive devices and digital switches. They can be used as active 
components, such as semiconductors to control voltage and electrical currents, 
in passive components, such as capacitors and resistors to moderate electrical 
current, or in mechanical applications, such as ferrite magnets or 
piezoelectric devices.</P> 


<B>STUDY GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</B> 

<P>Electronic ceramics have become a mature market among advanced ceramics and 
are still growing. BCC had published an earlier report on the same subject in 
1990. Since the publication of that report, many business reorganizations have 
occurred among producers of electronic ceramic components. Also, in the 1990s, 
the electronic ceramics industry has been doing quite well because of 
increased demand in electronic components and computers.</P> 

<P>This BCC report has been prepared to incorporate all these business changes 
and provide a detailed industry analysis for the benefit of producers and 
users of electronic ceramic components. Secondly, there have been new 
developments in materials, processing and applications in the areas of 
electronic ceramics. These have contributed to a need to make a proper 
analysis of the technological and business issues and trends in manufacturing 
as well as foreign competition.</P> 


<P>This report has been prepared with the following objectives:</P> 

<UL>

   <LI>To provide an overview of the various electronic ceramics, their 
     production technologies and applications.
   
   <LI>To identify the technological and business issues  related to the 
     commercial production of electronic ceramic components.
   <LI>To update the new developments in emerging technologies such as
     piezoelectric ceramics, ceramic packagings and high temperature
     superconductors.
   
   <LI>To analyze the domestic and foreign competition among companies within
     each of the electronic ceramic segments.
   
   <LI>To determine the current size and future growth of the markets for 
     electronic ceramic segments.
   
   <LI>To identify and profile all U.S. producers and suppliers of electronic 
     ceramic components.
   
   <LI>To identify the U.S. companies that are currently conducting research and
     development in electronic ceramics as well as their areas of research.
</UL>

<B>CONTRIBUTION TO THE STUDY</B> 

<P>BCCœs technical/economic study covers the markets, materials, fabrication 
techniques, current and emerging production methods, new developments in 
materials and processing techniques, current and emerging applications, and a 
market analysis. Current size and future growth of the markets are estimated 
for the period 1994 to the year 2000. The report analyzes the competitive 
environment within each of the markets for insulators, substrates, integrated 
circuits, capacitors, piezoelectric ceramics, ferrite magnets and 
superconductor ceramics. The report profiles all U.S.  producers and suppliers 
of electronic ceramic components.</P> 


<B>FORMAT AND SCOPE</B> 

<P>For each electronic ceramic application segment, the report provides an 
analysis of material types in that category, processing technologies, 
properties, applications, new developments, and the U.S. markets.</P> 

<P>The report provides a valuable contribution to the current knowledge of 
electronic ceramics including their processing techniques, applications and 
markets. The study also provides vital information on the growth of various 
market segments so as to help companies with their future strategies of 
involvement and expansion as well as deciding whether to enter new areas of 
the electronic ceramic business.</P> 

<B>METHODOLOGY AND INFORMATION SOURCES</B> 

<P>The findings of this report are based on information derived from interviews 
with almost all producers, potential producers and suppliers of electronic 
ceramic components, industry experts and those conducting research and 
development. In addition, many end users were contacted to evaluate the 
current and future demands for these materials. In all, about 200 persons from 
120 companies and a dozen institutions were contacted for this study.</P> 

<P>Secondary data was obtained from industry associations such as the Electronic 
Industry Association, the Magnetic Materials Producers Association; trade 
publications; technical journals; government statistics such as those from the 
Dept. of Commerce, International Trade Administration and Bureau of the 
Census; U.S. Patent Database and NTIS computer searches.</P>

<H3><I>INTRODUCTION</I></H3>
</CENTER>

Following a long period of extensive research and development
efforts, advanced structural ceramics are now a reality, with
increasing usage in many load-bearing applications such as cutting
tools, automotive engine components, heat exchangers,
wear-resistant parts and aerospace components.<P>

Among the structural ceramics applications, wear-resistant ceramic
components constitute an important segment. Wear has plagued
equipment designers and plant operators since the beginning of
industrial development. Wear affects equipment and plant
efficiency, maintenance frequency, product quality, profitability,
to name but a few variables. As industry becomes more time and cost
conscious, increasing attention is being paid to the wear of
critical components and the components' intrinsic relationship to
output and efficiency. Although advanced ceramic wear parts are
sometimes more expensive, they could still become cost effective if
efficiency is improved by reducing downtime.<P>

Monolithic ceramic is the most commonly used wear-resistant ceramic
material. In certain applications, ceramic fiber or
whisker-reinforced ceramic matrix composites are found to be better
than monolithic ceramics. Ceramic-coated components, which are also
produced commercially now, have properties similar to monolithic
ceramic or ceramic matrix composites.<P>

Wear-resistant ceramic applications include bearings, mechanical
seals, liners for mineral and processing industries, grinding
media, ball mill liners, metal processing dies, thread and wire
guides, pulleys, sandblast nozzles, etc. The components are
produced using monolithic ceramics, ceramic matrix composites or
ceramic coatings.<P>

<B>STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

Although several applications have been established in the
wear-resistant ceramics area, proper technical economic analyses of
the various segments have not been done so far. As a growing area,
BCC felt that a detailed analysis should be carried for each
segment.<P>

This report has been prepared with the following objectives:<P>

<MENU><LI>To provide an overview of the various ceramic wear-resistant
components, their production technologies and applications<P>

<LI>To identify the technological developments and business issues
related to the commercial production of ceramic wear-resistant
components<P>

<LI>To understand the inter-material competition among the various
ceramic wear-resistant components<P>

<LI> To analyze the domestic and foreign competition among
companies within each of the ceramic wear-resistant market
segments.<P>

<LI>To determine the current size and future growth of the U.S.
markets for ceramic wear-resistant components.<P>

<LI> To identify and profile all U.S. producers and suppliers of
ceramic wear-resistant components.<P>

<LI> To identify the foreign companies which manufacture ceramic
wear-resistant components.</MENU><P>

<B>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY</B><P>

The new BCC study provides an in-depth analysis of the
technological advancements, new applications, economics, current
markets and trends, and players. Forecasts for each segment are
provided to the year 1996.  Profiles of all U.S. companies and
institutions involved as suppliers, users, and researchers in the
advanced ceramic wear component industry are presented in Appendix
I. In Appendix II, we feature profiles of companies which supply
ceramic raw materials to the manufacturers of ceramic
wear-resistant parts.<P>

<B>FORMAT AND SCOPE</B><P>

The BCC study has been conducted with a global perspective in terms
of technology development and its applications. The market study
has been conducted for the U.S. only. However, Japanese and
European companies are positioning themselves to take niches of the
U.S. advanced ceramics market. Therefore, we have reviewed the
foreign competition for each wear-resistant ceramic market segment.<P>

The report provides business planners and managers with an improved
understanding of the direction and impact of wear-resistant
ceramics technology, and how markets will be affected and
opportunities created.<P>

The comprehensive report contains:<P>

<MENU><LI>    An overview of materials for wear-resistant ceramics,
processing, new developments, and recent patents.<P>

<LI>   Current and potential uses for wear-resistant ceramics,
including details of product applications.<P>

<LI>    An analysis of major advances in wear-resistant ceramics
technology.<P>

<LI>    Sales projections for wear-resistant ceramics in all the major
applications.<P>

<LI>   Detailed profiles of industry players as well as their product
lines and new product developments.<P>

<LI>    Review of the economic/market opportunities for current
industry participants and new entrants.</MENU><P>

We feel, therefore, that the qualitative and quantitative judgments
embodied in this report are a valuable contribution to the current
knowledge of wear-resistant ceramics. Moreover, we are making this
contribution at a vital stage in the development of this growing
industry, where decisions must soon be made by companies on their
strategies of involvement.<P>

<B>METHODOLOGY AND INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

Information for this report was collected through extensive
industry contact with people active in the development, production
and use of advanced ceramics and with those producers of
wear-resistant parts, from government and academic sources active
in research and development, and by reference to the technical
literature. Several industry experts were also interviewed for this
study. In addition, many end-users were contacted to evaluate the
current and future demands for these materials.<P>

Over 100 U.S. companies assisted BCC in identifying and updating
new material developments and their applications. A thorough
computer patent database search was conducted in addition to
consulting several NTIS published searches to evaluate new
developments. All the major technical and trade publications
together with conference proceedings were consulted.<P>

<B>STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

Although technology transfer and assistance programs offer companies
a way to get a larger bang for their research buck, the process is
quite complicated and confusing.  This BCC study is intended to help
eliminate some of the confusion and to provide a roadmap for those
interested in utilizing these resources as well for as those wishing
to make more effective use of them.<P>

The emphasis of most existing technology-transfer programs is on
transferring federally-funded research from national laboratories,
the military, universities, and other non-profit organizations to
the private sector and the States.  Hence, the focus of this BCC
report is primarily on these activities, which are addressed
quantitatively.<P>

However, there are other important aspects that are addressed
qualitatively.  Such aspects include technology assistance programs,
many of which are being established by the States with matching
funds from the Federal government; transfers from one private-sector
company to another; and international transfers.  Technology
assistance programs are being established to help small to mid-size
companies become more competitive through upgrading manufacturing
and computer capabilities (especially the use of online databases).
Private companies are involved in tech transfer through the
acquisition of new technologies and in shifting technologies that do
not fit their corporate structures to other firms.  International
transfers are experiencing more interest especially as a result of
the changes that are occurring in the former Soviet Union but also
because of the general trend of world market unification.<P>


<B>BACKGROUND INFORMATION</B><P>

It has been demonstrated that the aggressive refinement of existing
technology and the transforming of that technology into commercial
products works.  However, while U.S. companies seem to be reluctant
to do this, a number of foreign countries (Japan in particular) do
not have this reluctance.  The Japanese have quite successfully
taken U.S.-developed technologies (e.g., semiconductors, VCRs, LCDs,
certain types of optics and instrumentation, and flat-panel
displays) and turned them into commercial products.  However,
improved U.S. competitiveness through technology transfer will most
likely require the adoption by industry of a more long-range view
instead of the shortsighted quarterly- (or even monthly-) review.<P>

Tech transfer has received increasing attention and emphasis in
recent years as U.S. industrial competitiveness has eroded and as we
seek to make better use of our R&D dollars.  Federally-funded R&D is
being scrutinized for possible cuts because of the troubled economy
and our huge budget deficit.  The end of the Cold War has also
resulted in more emphasis on tech transfer.  As defense budgets
decline, it has become even more important for the Departments of
the Defense and Energy to demonstrate that their defense programs
can also be applied to peacetime applications.<P>

The purpose of the many federal and university tech transfer
programs is to effect better utilization of research and development
resources.  To quote Admiral James D. Watkins (Secretary of Energy),
"It is not enough to make it easier for industry to work with the
Federal government.  We have to make matches between what industry
wants and needs and what the Federal researchers can contribute."
However, it is not only a federal effort.  The above quote applies
not only to federal-laboratory researchers, but to university and
non-profit researchers that operate with funds from federal and
state programs.<P>

Organizations transfer technology through license agreements and, in
the case of government laboratories, Cooperative Research and
Development Agreements (CRADAs), reimbursable work-for-others
agreements, consulting, and user facilities.  Corporate technology
is also transferred through licensing as well as other arrangements
such as the sale of patents and business units or divisions, joint
ventures, and research consortias with other companies,
universities, and government agencies.<P>

The federally-funded laboratories (at least some of them) seem to be
very excited about being allowed to help American companies.
According to the Cooperative Technology RD&D Report, they feel that
"the real American technology genie is being let out of the bottle
with CRADAs, and that foreign companies are excluded from getting
their help."  However, note that there are some exceptions to the
no-foreign-company rule, especially for environmental, fossil-fuel,
and renewable-energy conservation technologies.<P>


<B>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P>

BCC feels that it is imperative to the U.S. that technology transfer
programs succeed and is, indeed, the wave of the future.  Although
Federal technology transfer is not a panacea for U.S. industry and
has many, many hurdles to overcome, it is a massive and extremely
important resource that American industry should not ignore.
Unfortunately, the difficulty in dealing with the bureaucracy
requires those interested in obtaining technologies to be persistent
and not give up when (not if) difficulties and frustrations are
encountered.  In addition, the programs and resources to facilitate
these activities seem to change almost daily!  Hopefully, one day
the bugs will be worked out and a system that works (for all
organizations and not just a select few) will be in place.  Until
then, BCC hopes to provide a link for those involved in these
activities and an important means of disseminating information.<P>

<B>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY AND FOR WHOM</B><P>

This BCC report will prove invaluable for individuals and
organizations involved in technology transfer.  In particular, those
who will benefit from this study include:<P>

<UL><LI>Organizations interested in discovering how to obtain rights
        to new technologies and how to participate in cooperative
     research ventures<P>

 <LI>Those currently licensing technologies or participating in
     cooperative research ventures<P>

 <LI>Companies and other research organizations that have
     technology available for licensing or joint projects or
     are in the process of developing transferable technologies<P>

 <LI>Officials involved in setting up technology transfer
programs<P>

<LI>Organizations that facilitate the transfer process such as
     associations, consulting companies, brokers, etc.<P>

<LI>Those interested in learning what resources are available to
     assist in setting up international ventures.<P></UL>


<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

The report discusses exactly what technology transfer is, the
process, programs, culture clashes, and the various mechanisms or
models that may be used in its implementation.  The study also
discusses the response to the call by "the powers that be" for
technology transfer and the special programs that have been
developed.  Information on the following is provided:<P>

<H3><I>INTRODUCTION</I></H3>
</CENTER>

Carbon fiber has been used as a fibrous reinforcement for composite materials
for the last 25 years. Even though high-performance carbon fibers were first
introduced in the 1960s, the physical properties of these reinforcing fibers
have improved dramatically over the past decade. This can be attributed to
three developments: significant improvements in both quality and performance
of the precursor fiber; a substantial increase in worldwide production
capacity and process improvements resulting from this gain in production
experience; and a strong push on the part of the United States and Western
European aerospace industries for high performance carbon-based reinforcing
fibers.<P>

Military aircrafts and aerospace applications provided a boost to the
commercial use of carbon fibers. However, the carbon companies have now
shifted their thrust from military aircraft to commercial aircraft, industrial
applications, and sporting goods.<P>


<b>STUDY GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

Before the cold war was over in the late 1980s, the prospects for carbon
fibers were very bright. The military establishment strongly promoted U.S. self reliance on carbon fibers for military applications. The markets were forecasted to double and triple by the mid 1990s by several industry experts.  In the late 1980s, the government also passed legislation that would make it mandatory for the military to buy domestically produced polyacrylonitrile. In turn, the producers started or added to their capacities for domestically produced polyacrylonitrile. However, because of major defense cuts, there was a slump in the market. Certain defense programs, including some of the new military aircraft, were shelved for the time being because of the massive cuts in the military.  This caused the carbon fiber industry to go through a turmoil in the early 1990s. Some companies exited from the business while others shut down their production facilities briefly to reduce the inventories.<P>

The recession in the last three years was also a factor in the downturn of the
carbon fiber industry. However, the economy is now showing signs of
improvement. Several nonmilitary segments, such as the industrial, sports and
recreation products, have been growing. The carbon fiber industry's thrust has
now shifted from military to commercial applications.<P>

The trends in acquisitions and joint ventures are continuing in the carbon
fiber industry. The Japanese companies have also entered the U.S. market by
setting up their own subsidiaries or through acquisition and joint ventures.<P>

Business Communications Company has tracked all of these industry
developments. Earlier it published a report, "High Performance Fibers - A
Technical Economic Study," in 1987 and another report, "Structural Carbon," in
1989. Both these reports had extensively covered carbon fibers.<P>

Since our last study in 1990, major changes have occurred in the U.S. and
global carbon fiber industry structure. Many companies have reorganized or
joined together. With all these changes, BCC felt that a detailed analysis
should be conducted on this important industry.<P>

This report has been prepared with the following objectives:<P>

<UL>-    To provide an industry overview of the U.S. and global carbon fiber
     industry<P>

-    To determine the current size and future growth of the U.S. and  global
     markets for carbon fibers<P>

-    To provide a technology overview, including material types, properties and
     applications for carbon fibers and carbon fiber products<P>

-    To review technological developments, including the U.S. and foreign
     developments as well as the recent patents in carbon fibers and carbon
     fiber products<P>

-    To analyze the domestic and foreign competition in the carbon fiber
     industry<P>

-    To identify and profile all U.S. companies and institutions involved in the
     carbon fiber industry<P>

-    To review the acquisitions, mergers, joint ventures and licensing
     agreements among carbon fiber companies on a global scale<P>

-    To determine the trends in the carbon fiber markets.<P></UL>


<b>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY</B><P>

This new BCC study provides an in-depth analysis of technological
advancements, new applications, economics, current markets and trends, and
players. Forecasts for each U.S. market segment are provided to the year 1998.
Profiles of all U.S. producer and user companies have been provided. In-depth
analyses are presented on the global carbon fiber industry structure,
providing detailed information on acquisitions, mergers, joint ventures and
licensing agreements.<P>

Through this report we hope to provide a better understanding of the U.S. and
global carbon fiber industry, including current markets, market potential and
players. Detailed profiles of all U.S. companies who are producers of carbon
fiber and carbon fiber products are provided in this report. This study
provides the most up to date information we have gathered on the carbon fiber
industry.<P>


<b>FORMAT AND SCOPE</B><P>

This study has been conducted with a global perspective in terms of technology
developments, applications and markets. The market projections reflect this
global focus. The Japanese companies have positioned themselves to take a
large percentage of the global market. Therefore, we have provided detailed
analyses of foreign acquisitions, mergers and licensing agreements which are
happening in the carbon fiber industry.<P>

The report provides business planners and managers with an improved
understanding of the direction of the carbon fiber industry and how markets
will be affected and new opportunities created.<P>

The comprehensive report contains:<P>

<UL><LI>   An overview of carbon fibers, their properties, new
         developments, and recent patents.<P>

<LI>   Current and potential uses for carbon fibers.<P>

<LI>   An analysis of major advances in carbon fiber technology.<P>

<LI>   Sales projections for carbon fibers in all the major market
         segments.<P>

<LI>   Detailed profiles of industry players as well as their product
         lines and new product developments.<P>

<LI>   Review of the economic/market opportunities for current
         industry participants and new entrants.<P></UL>

We feel, therefore, that the qualitative and quantitative judgments embodied
in this report are a valuable contribution to the current knowledge of the
carbon fiber industry. Moreover, we are making this contribution at a vital
stage when drastic changes are happening in the carbon fiber industry with the
emergence of several nonmilitary applications.<P>

<b>METHODOLOGY AND INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

Information for this report was collected through extensive industry contacts
with people active in the research, development, production and use of
advanced ceramic components, from government and academic sources active in
research and development, and by reference to the technical literature.
Several industry experts were also interviewed for this study. In addition,
many end-users were contacted to evaluate the current and future demands for
these materials.<P>

Over 50 U.S. companies assisted BCC in identifying and updating new
developments, applications and markets. A thorough U.S. patent database search
was conducted for the period from the middle of 1991 to the middle of 1993, in
addition to consulting several NTIS published searches to evaluate new
developments. All the major technical and trade publications and conference
proceedings were used for this study.<P>

</CENTER>

Diamond possesses the greatest hardness and greatest thermal
conductivity among all known materials. Combined with these
important properties, diamond has very low thermal expansion and
high electrical resistance. Because of its hardness, diamond is far
more effective and efficient than other competing materials used
for abrasive, cutting, shaping or finishing tools. Its very high
thermal conductivity makes it ideal for spreading and conducting
the heat out of compact, high power, high speed electronic
packages. However, synthetic diamond has been produced by high
pressure and high temperature techniques.<P> 

In recent years, a low pressure technique to produce diamond using
chemical vapor deposition (CVD) has drawn worldwide attention.
There has been an explosion of interest in CVD diamond, diamond-
like and CBN films and coatings. These films are expected to be
used in a variety of applications from cutting tools to wear-
resistant parts, and from electronics to optical applications. One
advantage of CVD diamond technology over the high-pressure
technology is its low cost and its ability to coat any shapes.<P> 

CVD diamond has advantages in being incorporated in electronic
packages due to its extremely high thermal conductivity, coupled
with its excellent dielectric properties. Also, large substrates
are now available and a variety of package designs are possible
with CVD diamond. Tool inserts with CVD diamond thick-film blanks
or thin-film coatings constitute the newest tool material. Diamond
and diamond-like coatings are also finding increasing applications
in optical applications such as sunglasses, ophthalmic lenses and
IR windows.<P>
  

<b>STUDY GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

This BCC report has been prepared because a lot of new developments
have been taking place in the CVD diamond, diamond-like and CBN
thin films, and coated products. Some of the market segments have
achieved production scale while others are still in the testing and
prototype quantities. Secondly, there are several new potential
applications such as semiconductors, protective coatings and
advanced flat panel displays, which would revolutionize electronic
and consumer products. These have warranted a need for a proper
analysis of the technological and business issues, trends in
research, development and manufacturing, as well as the worldwide 
competition in the diamond film and coated products industry.  
This report has been prepared with the following objectives:<P>

<LI> To provide an overview of the various industrial diamond,
     diamond-like and CBN thin films and coated products, their
     production technologies and applications.<P>

</CENTER> 

<B>STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B>

<P>The goals and objectives of this technical/marketing study are to illustrate the
complexity and dynamic nature of the U.S. specialty water treatment chemicals
industry, within the context of the marketplace.  This study seeks to ascertain how
this industry relates to and is influenced by government regulations, technology and
economic factors.  It also aims to provide the facts, figures, and statistics necessary to
evaluate and to make projections regarding this industry. </P>  


<B>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B>

<P>This revised BCC technical/marketing study provides an in-depth analysis that
forecasts and tracks significant changes in the mature, yet still dynamic, U.S.
specialty water treatment chemicals industry.  The risks and rewards involved in
these economic, environmental, governmental, and technological changes determine
the difference between success or failure in this industry.</P> 


<B>HISTORY OF THE MARKET</B>

<P>Plagued by impure water for centuries, mankind has employed a variety of primitive
purification means to produce clean, potable water.  These means range from Moses
throwing a tree and Elisha throwing a cruse of salt into impure water sources to an
ancient Hindu filtration recipe that involves boiling foul water in copper pots and
filtering it through charcoal.  As early as 1450 B.C., the Egyptians are reported to
have used siphons to draw clear water from settling tanks.  The Chinese are credited
with the discovery that the addition of aluminum sulfate to contaminated water
coagulates the turbidity and increases the settled water's potability.  An extensive
waterworks network employed by the Roman Empire is said to have included the
first reliable meters, the extensive use of settling tanks, and the separation of potable
water, heated process water, sewage, and storm runoff.</P>  

<P>The U.S. water treatment chemicals industry has its roots in the desire to produce a
clean, disease-free supply of potable water for municipal consumers.  Within 20 years
of the British Parliament requiring the City of London to use sand filters for
removing bacteria and other impurities from its water, Poughkeepsie, NY was
installing them.  By 1912, liquid chlorine was being applied to U.S. municipal water
systems to destroy disease-producing bacteria.</P>

<P>Since that time, the U.S. water treatment industry has now evolved into the design of
facilities for the conveyance, control and treatment of industrial waters.  This
evolvement comes in response to an altered federal environmental policy and a
shifting of national industrial priorities.  From that response comes the trend toward
waste minimization and water recycling/reuse.  This evolvement has also seen the
creation of the government water expert, who (in theory) balances the public's need
for a reliable supply of potable water with industry's need to operate in a safe,
ultimately profitable manner.</P>  

<P>Over the last 25 years, the U.S. water treatment chemicals industry has also
segmented into commodity and specialty chemicals, with the basis of the
segmentation being how the individual chemical or chemical formulation is sold. 
Specialty chemicals remains the most competitive and fastest growing segment, due
to the development of new polymer technologies that enhance water/solids separation
and higher-priced products that replace chlorine, chromates, and hydrazine. </P> 


<B>SCOPE OF THE REPORT</B>

<P>Water treatment touches nearly every individual or industry in one way or another,
as the water treatment industry seeks to bring impure water up to potable standards
or better.  As this extremely large industry continues to expand, the lines between
commodity and specialty chemicals and mechanical and other treatment methods
sometimes blurs.</P> 

<P>This report concentrates on the most competitive, high-growth segment of the water
treatment industry:  those chemicals sold by specialty suppliers.  Using information
gathered from diverse sources, this report has been organized into a cohesive unit
that includes an overview of the industry with relevant information on the
environmental and regulatory constraints and actions that greatly control this
industry.  This report addresses the structure of the industry and its competitive
aspects, as well as specialty water treatment chemicals by function and market
application.  Abstracted patents represent many of the research and development
trends in the industry.  Not all of these patents become commercialized; however,
they do illustrate areas of company activity and alternative technologies under
development.</P>


<B>METHODOLOGY</B>

<P>The methodologies employed in this study include extensive library research and
information from BCC internal files, as well as contact with representatives from the
leading water treatment chemicals companies.  This report also ilcludes an on-line
data search of databases that cover all existing literature and an evaluation of
government statistics, company activities, state-of-the-art technology, and patents. 
Since it revises, expands, and updates an older BCC report, the report contains some
historical and background information from the older report.  This information
conforms to the newer BCC format and the more focused objectives of this report.</P>

<P>Values reflect U.S. sales of specialty water treatment chemicals for the market
applications covered in this report.  Projections for the 1995-2000 time period are
given in 1995 constant dollars and represent real growth.  Where precise information
was not available, a consensus was made, using a formulation of reasonable
assumptions and estimates based on a baseline obtained from historical data.</P>

      
<B>VALUE OF THE REPORT</B>

<P>This report consolidates a range of legislative/industrial/technical information into a
comprehensive technical/marketing study.  This study should aid technical personnel
in the research and development of water treatment chemicals, as well as suppliers to
any of the application market applications and readers interested in discovering and
exploiting current or projected market sub-niches.  Senior marketing, venture
capitalists, executive planners, government officials, and environmentalists should
find this report of interest.  As for the novice reader who desires to understand how
regulation, market pressures, and technology interact in the water treatment
chemicals industry, this report should be a key source.</P>

<B>GOALS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE REPORT</B><P>


Flame Retardant Chemicals presents a detailed view of market size, growth, and
trends for this industry.  The major product lines and applications are
identified and the market size for each product line and application is
estimated for the next five years. Significant technological trends and
developments in materials and applications are identified and analyzed.
International aspects of the flame retardant chemical market are discussed,
and the structure of the industry is addressed, including profiles of the
major flame retardant chemicals suppliers.<P>


<B>REASONS FOR DOING THE REPORT</B><P>

The flame retardant chemicals industry has historically been driven by
regulations and standards.  The normal fire-, smoke-, and toxicity-related
standards have been joined by environmental standards caused by the alleged
environmental impact of halogens and the alleged toxicity of antimony.
Although suitable replacements have not been found for these materials in all
cases, the environmental concern has served to depress their growth levels
from what it would otherwise have been and/or channel the growth into
alternative chemical products.<P>


<B>CONTRIBUTION OF THE REPORT AND FOR WHOM</B><P>

Flame Retardant Chemicals provides in-depth information and state-of-the art
technological evaluations for decision making by those involved in, or
considering becoming involved in, the supply of flame retardant chemicals to
the plastics, textiles, wood/paper paint, and paint/coatings industries.  The
study can assist clients in strategic planning, acquisition analysis,
technology analysis, commercial development of new products, and analysis of
competitors' strategies, strengths, weaknesses, pricing, market share, and
profitability.<P>


<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT OF THE REPORT</B><P>

This report analyzes the products, applications, technology, international
aspects, industry structure, and profiles of key companies/organizations
involved in the supply of flame retardant chemicals to the plastics, textiles,
wood/paper paint, and paint/coatings industries.

The format of this report is to state all values, projections, and forecasts
in terms of constant dollars unless otherwise noted.  All numbers and
projections are substantiated or noted as to their origin.<P>


<B>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

The background research of Flame Retardant Chemicals consisted of a thorough
analysis of trade, government, and company literature, and the extensive
information in BCC's database.  An extensive series of personal and telephone
interviews with key executives and officials in the industries, trade
associations, and government followed the background work.  The expert and
reasoned comments of these people, combined with BCC experience and analysis,
provide the basis for the content of this report.<P>

This report summarizes the changes which have occurred in the flame retardant
chemicals industry since the March 1990 BCC report.  The consumption and
market size for phosphorus-based flame retardant chemicals contained in this
report are markedly different than those contained in the 1990 report.  The
difference is due to a change in the method of computing the consumption of
phosphorus used in the U.S., from which the amount of phosphorus used in flame
retardant chemicals was derived. This new BCC report reflects the consumption
of phosphorus (atomic weight 31).  The previous report considered the
consumption of phosphorus in its many molecular forms, including P2O5 and PO4.<P>


<B>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

Major sources of information are noted throughout the report and in Appendix A
(Works Cited).<P>


<B>BCC CREDENTIALS</B><P>

The author of this report has worked on many assignments dealing with the
supply of technologically advanced materials to industry, and has analytical
familiarity with many of the important issues influencing the supply of flame
retardant chemicals to the plastics, textiles, wood/paper paint, and
paint/coatings industries.<P>

<B>REASONS FOR DOING THIS STUDY</B><P>

This technical/marketing study is an in-depth analysis which
forecasts and tracks significant changes in the
specialty/structural adhesives industry.  This highly fragmented
industry caters to dynamic end-use markets in which customer
demands quickly change.  Even when an end-use market levels off,
niche markets appear that aid adhesive growth.<P>

This report seeks to assess the current status and future
outlook for the specialty/structural adhesives industry.
Specifically of interest are the competitive aspects of the
industry.  Merger and acquisition activity has been brisk.
Companies are restructuring in order to maintain a competitive
edge in domestic as well as international markets.<P>

Sophisticated products and processes continue to affect
traditional means of fastening.  High-tech markets are demanding
new chemistries and high levels of consistency and performance
from specialty/structural adhesives.  With the advent of high
performance engineering plastics, adhesives are increasingly
required to perform well under extreme temperatures, while
maintaining bonding strength and physical and chemical
properties.<P>

The specialty/structural adhesives industry has not escaped the
myriad of environmental regulations written over the last
decade.  Like the chemical industry in general, the adhesives
sector is developing technology that meets or exceeds
governmental regulations.  New products are being developed that
anticipate any possible future hazards.  Methodology that allows
for any adjustments to meet future environmental demands is
being established at a product's inception.<P>

<B>HISTORY OF THE MARKET</B><P>

Great strides have been made in the specialty/structural
adhesives industry since primitive man first used natural resins
and pitch to affix spearheads to shafts.  Adhesive systems have
advanced since the first glue was developed by Elijah Upton in
1808.  The development of synthetic resins in the 1930s was to
bring changes in the specialty/structural adhesives industry
during World War II.<P>

These synthetic resins were necessary alternatives to the
natural rubber solutions that had been used for adhesion since
the 1700s.  Bonding technology advanced rapidly as the nation
switched to synthetic adhesives.  By 1943, the high frequency
heating of glue lines was commercialized.  Synthetic adhesives
were used to bond paper, ceramics, glass, textiles, rubbers and
plastics.  Adhesives were developed with higher strength and
greater durability than animal- and plant-derived glues.<P>

Later, space exploration, which required lightweight components
and airtight bonding, lent a boost to the bonding of metal
substrates.  Structural adhesives began in the early honeycomb
bonding programs associated with the first of the solid fuel
rockets developed at Redstone Arsenal.<P>


<B>SCOPE OF THIS REPORT</B><P>

This report quantifies and qualifies market information on
specialty and structural adhesives for the U.S. market.  Both
opportunities and pitfalls of the industry are explored, as are
the impact they may have on the industry.  Specific market
segments that are representative of the industry as a whole are
discussed.  This report targets only specialty/structural
adhesives.  Excluded are those used for packaging and common
consumer glues.<P>


<B>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

This study is divided into key chapters dealing with the
environmental impact on, the markets for and the resin systems
of specialty/structural adhesives.  This report is limited to an
analysis of the specialty/structural segment of adhesives only
and does not include the adhesives industry in general. Emphasis
is given to the latest market information on product
development.<P>

Much of the information for this technical/marketing report was
gathered through telephone conversations with industry,
government and academic experts in the field.  The balance of
the information was gathered from available government, trade
and technical publications.  An on-line data search was made of
data bases to retrieve information and cover all of the existing
literature.<P>

Projections are in terms of constant dollars.  Historical values
are for the year given.  The specific geographical area covered
is the U.S.  Predictions are for the 1990-1995 time period.<P>


<B>VALUE OF THIS REPORT</B><P>

This comprehensive technical/marketing study will be valuable to
senior marketing and planning executives.  Technical personnel
engaged in research and development, together with marketing and
business managers involved in the formulation of
specialty/structural adhesives will find this report of value.
Leading industry authorities will discover the latest
developments in products, competition and technology.<P>

<B>STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

Depending on how they are defined, water soluble polymers (WSPs)
represent a 5.0 billion pound, $2.9 billion dollar market.  It is
a rare industry that does not rely on WSPs during some stage of the
production process.  WSPs have always been important (water-based
animal glues and food binders can be traced to prehistoric times).
During the Seventies, increased environmental concern and the
realization that inexpensive petroleum-based products were gone
forever sparked new interest in WSPs.  Processors have realized
that water-based formulations can measure up to petroleum-based
formulations in cost, performance, and especially environmental
acceptability.  Despite recessionary industrial activity levels,
and slowed construction activity, WSPs have consistently performed
better than many other commodities, specialty chemicals, polymers,
or agricultural derivatives.<P>

<B>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P>

Now, in the 1990s, natural, synthetic, and semi-synthetic WSPs are
continuing to compete with each other for market position in this
expanded market.  A better understanding of WSP chemical
structures, improved microbial fermentation technology, more
efficient production processes, and the development of formulations
approved for human consumption have helped maintain an active WSP
market.  Developments in degradable products, enhanced oil
recovery, processed foods, wastewater flocculants, cleaning
formulations, pulp and paper sizings, and water-based inks have the
potential for creating new WSP markets.  This BCC Business
Opportunity Report addresses the potential of these markets.<P>

<B>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY AND FOR WHOM</B><P>

This report should be a basic market reference and technology
summary for the farmers, miners, chemical processors, importers,
and manufacturers who deal in, or are considering dealing in the
water soluble chemical market.  Highly competitive chemical
suppliers should find the report particularly useful.  WSP
consumers, from whatever consuming or producing market sector, can
identify existing and developing chemical alternatives.  Designers
and process engineers can track the performance of the WSPs useful
for a specific application.  Finally, producers and suppliers of
competing materials are provided with a valuable outline of what
WSPs can and can't do.  The report author wishes to thank all of
the manufacturers and WSP consumers who cooperated in the
preparation of this report.<P>

<B>SCOPE & FORMAT</B><P>

This report divides the WSP industry in two ways: by consumer
(markets) and by producer (WSP chemicals).Water soluble polymers
represent a diverse and varied group of agricultural and industrial
chemicals.  Nearly every industrial sector uses WSPs during some
phase of its operation.  Unfortunately, this has discouraged a
unified, coherent set of nomenclature.  Indeed, substances
identified as water soluble polymers by one industrial sector may
not be considered water soluble polymers by a different sector.
WSPs can be classified by derivation, chemical structures, and
application.  They are derived from natural sources (gums,
proteins, celluloses, starches, etc.), from wholly synthetic
sources (polyvinyls, polyacrylates, polyimines, petroleum
sulfonates, etc.), and semi-synthetic sources formed by modifying
natural materials to produce forms with more desirable properties.
This report adopts a classification scheme based on marketing
considerations.  A material will be considered a water soluble
polymer if: 1) it contains at least 10 monomer units in the polymer
chain, 2) it forms an aqueous solution under commonly encountered
industrial conditions, and 3) it is recognized or marketed as a
water soluble polymer for a given application by a specific
consuming market sector.  The total WSP market has been further
divided into nine sectors: gums, biopolymers, proteins, starches,
celluloses, polyvinyls, polyacrylics, polyimines, and surface
active WSPs.<P>

This report divides the market for water soluble polymers into nine
consuming sectors: adhesives, pulp and paper, textiles, foods,
drugs and cosmetics, the oilfield, paints and coatings, water
treatment, degradable products, plus a miscellaneous category.<P>

<B>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

This Business Opportunity Report is intended to be the most
complete technical, economic and business document of this type on
this subject and is designed to provide information of a
professional nature.  The technical data are dependent on the
accuracy of the manufacturers and technical sources that helped
make up the BCC database.  This report is not intended to
constitute a legal or accounting document, nor is it an endorsement
of any given product or process.  The author, and BCC Inc., as the
publisher, assume no liability for loss or damage as a result of
reliance on this material.<P>

Historic growth, value, and price data are expressed in current
dollars.  All values represent wholesale level prices unless
otherwise mentioned.  All predictions are expressed in constant
1990 dollars.  Predictions for the periods 1990-1995 and 1995-2000
are based on a synthesis of the BCC database.  Growth rates are
average annual growth rates for those periods. Totals are rounded
to the nearest million.  When appropriate, information from
previously published sources is identified to allow a more detailed
examination by clients.<P>


<B>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

This report is based on a literature review, patent examination,
discussions with commercial and government sources, and an analysis
of raw material sources and markets.  This BCC Business Opportunity
Report represents a complete revision, expansion, and update of our
1985 report, C-012R Water-Based Polymers: Markets, Technologies,
Developments.  Since then, the market has altered significantly.
An entirely new data base has been prepared, drawing from
correspondence and contact with WSP suppliers, consumers, trade
journals, technical articles, government statistics, and
industry-sponsored conferences.  The report project supervisor has
authored several related BCC Business Opportunity Reports,
including analyses of the oilfield chemicals, enhanced oil
recovery, water treatment chemicals, environmental management, and
corrosion inhibitor markets.  BCC's monthly technical newsletters
on enhanced oil recovery, applied genetics engineering, and
membrane separations also provide a unique source of important
background material.<P>

</CENTER>

<B>STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

Depending on who compiles the figures, corrosion costs the
national economy between $10 and $30 billion per year.  Sixteen
billion is a good representative figure for the cost of
potentially preventable corrosion.  Corrosion can be reduced by
using inherently corrosion resistant materials (special alloys,
plastic resins, etc.), by coating corrodible materials (with
films, paints, mastics or coatings), or through cathodic
protection and sacrificial anodes.  In many cases, the most cost
effective way to control corrosion is through the use of
corrosion inhibitors.   Corrosion inhibitors are consumed by the
water treatment industry, the oilfield/petrochemical industry,
and the manufacturing industry.  This report analyses the
corrosion inhibitor market in terms of both producers and
consumers.<P>

<B>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P>

Despite level per capita water consumption, a collapse of the
oilfield chemical market, recessionary industrial activity
levels, and competition from inherently non-corrosive materials,
the corrosion inhibitor industry has survived.  The corrosion
inhibitor market consists of bulk commodity chemicals, specialty
chemicals, and highly proprietary formulations.  A variety of new
products are vying for a position in the competitive corrosion
inhibitor marketplace.  Several historically important inhibitors
are associated with environmental problems.  When these chemicals
will be replaced, by what, and at what cost, are questions being
asked by producer and consumer alike. This BCC Business
Opportunity Report, latest in a series, identifies the technology
involved, reviews the market, and forecasts future corrosion
inhibitor consumption.<P>

<B>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY AND FOR WHOM</B><P>

This Business Opportunity Report should be a basic market
reference and technology summary for the miners, chemical
processors, and manufacturers who are involved in, or are
considering becoming involved in the corrosion inhibitor market.
Highly competitive chemical suppliers should find the report
particularly useful.  Corrosion inhibitor consumers, from
whatever consuming or producing market sector, can identify
existing and developing chemical alternatives.  Designers and
process engineers can track the performance of the corrosion
inhibitors useful for a specific application.  Finally, producers
and suppliers of competing materials are provided with a valuable
outline of what corrosion inhibitors can and can't do.  The
report author wishes to thank all of the corrosion inhibitor
producers and consumers who cooperated in the preparation of this
report.<P>

<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

This Business Opportunity Report organizes the corrosion
inhibitor industry in two ways: by consumer (markets) and by
producer (corrosion inhibitor chemicals).<P>

Corrosion inhibitor chemicals include bulk commodity inorganics
and organics, their byproducts and derivatives, specialty
inorganics and organics, and a variety of proprietary mixtures
and custom designed formulations.  For the purposes of this
report, corrosion inhibitors are organized according to chemical
structure.  Groups tracked include:<P>

<UL>Chromium-containing<BR>
Phosphorus-containing<BR>
Miscellaneous inorganic<BR>
Nitrogen-containing organic<BR>
Non-nitrogen-containing organic</UL><P>

Chemistry, applications, and sources and suppliers of specific
chemical compounds within these groups are provided.<P>

This report tracks the following corrosion inhibitor consuming
market sectors:<P>

<UL>Potable water<BR>
Steam generators and boilers<BR>
Recirculating water and cooling towers<BR>
The oilfield<BR>
Pipelines and storage tanks<BR>
Petrochemical refineries</UL><P>

A number of minor markets, including hydraulic fluids and
lubricants, metal preparation, cleaning, coolants, and machining
fluids, and concrete inhibiting markets are also discussed.<P>

A series of market sector case studies provide graphic examples of
specific corrosion inhibitor applications.  A series of formulation
examples, provided by corrosion inhibitor producers or consumers,
exemplify mixing techniques, application processes, and special
handling requirements.  This material is provided as an example,
for information purposes only.  Corrosion inhibitor company
profiles are also provided.<P>

<B>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

This Business Opportunity Report is intended to be the most
complete technical, economic and business document of this type on
this subject and is designed to provide information of a
professional nature.  The technical data are dependent on the
accuracy of the manufacturers and technical sources that helped
make up the BCC database.  This report is not intended to
constitute a legal or accounting document, nor is it an endorsement
of any given product or process.  The authors, and BCC Inc., as the
publisher, assume no liability for loss or damage as a result of
reliance on  this material.<P>

Historic growth, value, and price data are expressed in current
dollars.  All values represent wholesale level prices unless
otherwise mentioned.  All predictions are expressed in constant
1992 dollars.  Predictions for the period 1992-1997 are based on a
synthesis of the BCC database.  Growth rates are average annual
growth rates for those periods. Totals are rounded to the nearest
million.  When appropriate, information from previously published
sources is identified to allow a more detailed examination by
clients.<P>

<B>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

This report is based on a literature review, patent examination,
discussions with commercial and government sources, and an analysis
of raw material sources and markets.  This BCC Business Opportunity
Report represents a complete revision, expansion, and update of the
company's 1984 report, C-020A Corrosion Inhibitors: A Technical-
Economic Market Analysis.  Since then, the market has altered
significantly.  An entirely new data base has been prepared,
drawing from correspondence and contact with corrosion inhibitor
suppliers, consumers, trade journals, technical articles,
government statistics, and industry-sponsored conferences.  The
report project supervisor has authored several related BCC Business
Opportunity Reports, including analyses of the oilfield chemical,
enhanced oil recovery, water treatment chemicals, environmental
management, and water soluble polymer markets.  BCC's monthly
technical newsletters on enhanced oil recovery and waste treatment
technology have also provided a unique source of background
material.<P>

<B>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P>

Antioxidants are compounds which reduce the rate of oxidation in
auto-oxidizable organic materials, thus preventing their
deterioration.  Antioxidants find applications in plastics, rubber
and elastomers, foods, fuels and other functional fluids,
agricultural feeds, and cosmetics.  The types of antioxidants used
in a particular market subsector are fairly well-established.
Restrictions in application are generally limited to cost,
effectiveness, stability within a given system, and the
minimization of undesirable effects such as discoloration in
plastics.  Additional regulations governing health and safety exist
within the food and agricultural markets and, to a lesser extent,
in cosmetics.<P>

Controversy exists.  Within the food antioxidant market, specific
chemicals such as BHT, BHA, sodium nitrate, and sodium nitrite have
been implicated as causes of cancer.  Sulfites have been
responsible for significant allergic reactions in some members of
the population.  These effects, prompting concern from government
and private agencies, provide areas of growth for new or
alternative antioxidants, or for other methods of preservation.
However, some of the alternatives, for instance food irradiation,
are as, or even more, controversial than the use of antioxidants.
Thus, despite some hesitancies, antioxidants will continue to play
a vital role in various industries, warranting an analysis of the
market.<P>

<B>OBJECTIVES OF THE REPORT</B><P>

The objectives of this report are to provide an overview of the
different classes of antioxidants, their relative importance and
share in the overall antioxidant market, and estimates of their
future potential growth.  Important to this evaluation is a
concomitant analysis of the trends in those industries in which
antioxidants are employed.<P>

<B>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY</B><P>

The information in this report may be of interest to those
manufacturers, suppliers, and investors already involved in the
antioxidant business or those considering a venture into this area.
Any company marketing antioxidants to the food and agricultural
sectors will find the legislative and standards guidelines helpful.
This report hopes to emphasize the necessity of antioxidants in
vital market sectors and the important role that they play in
protecting and preserving plastics, food, rubber, functional
fluids, and related products.<P>



<B>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

This report classifies antioxidants into six categories based upon
their chemical structure and/or functionality:  1) hindered
phenolics, 2) nitrogen compounds, 3) acids and their derivatives,
4) sulfur compounds, 5) phosphorous compounds, and 6) miscellaneous
compounds with unique modes of operation, such as chelating agents
and biological antioxidants.<P>

The antioxidants are then analyzed according to the market
subsectors in which they are used.  The areas treated in this
report are plastics, rubber and elastomers, food, functional
fluids, and "others" (agriculture, cosmetics, etc.).<P>

Values given refer to the manufacturers' sales in current dollars.
Projections are provided through the year 2001 and are given in
constant dollars.  Projections are a summation of market forces,
technology, and regulatory factors.<P>

<B>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

The information in this report was gathered from interviews with
antioxidant manufacturers, product literature, periodical reviews,
and government documents and publications.  A patent search was
conducted.  The full text of U.S. patents is available from the
U.S. Patent Office.  All estimates are made by BCC unless otherwise
specified.<P>

<B>REASONS FOR DOING THIS STUDY</B><P>

This industry research\technical market study has been prepared as an in-depth
analysis to forecast and track significant changes in the chemicals for
finished cosmetic and toiletry products in the U.S.  While the basic types of
these finished products have remained largely the same, many of the chemicals
used as fillers, solvents and active ingredients have changed due to recent
developments in biochemical processing methods. Despite the maturity of the
cosmetic and toiletries market, a dynamic of change in chemical formulation
continues to evolve from advances made in specialty chemicals and the need of
chemical producers to accommodate the greater diversity found in all finished
cosmetic and toiletry products.<P>


<B>HISTORY OF THE MARKET</B><P>

Throughout the ages, people have used cosmetics and toiletries to enhance
their personal appeal.  The tombs of Egyptian kings dating as far back as 3500
B.C. contain evidence of perfumed hair oils and beautiful box chests in which
cosmetics were kept.  Both upper-class Egyptian men and women darkened their
eyelids with black and green pigments, while the women also rouged their lips
and cheeks and stained their hair with henna. Cold cream originated in Roman
times, reportedly circa 200 A.D.  Both ladies and gentlemen of 17th and 18th century Europe used cosmetics lavishly.<P>

Today, the ancient impulse to improve one's appearance with cosmetics is
getting help from modern specialty chemicals and science.  Cosmetics are
becoming a highly technical business, with the growth of products which are
supposed to act like pharmaceuticals revolutionizing the business and
enhancing the demand for certain natural chemicals, such as alpha hydroxy,
hyaluronic and amino acids, and proteins, such as collagen.  The high rate of
growth in sales of sunscreen products or cosmetics containing them also
continues to effect change.<P>


<B>SCOPE OF THIS REPORT</B><P>

This BCC study evaluates the contribution of specialty chemicals to the
finished cosmetic and toiletry products industry.  In turn, it offers a
comprehensive review of basic developments in the cosmetics industry and any
resulting effects on the markets for cosmetic chemicals.  Although the focus
of this report is U.S. manufacturers' sales of cosmetic chemical ingredients,
due to the global nature of both the finished cosmetic products and cosmetic
chemical ingredients markets, recent international patents that could affect
U.S. markets are mentioned.  Besides an overview, the report also includes an
in-depth evaluation of the structure of the cosmetic chemicals industry and
its competitive aspects.<P>

Significant space and discussion are given to the five major finished cosmetic
and toiletry product categories.  Current manufacturers' sales of these items
are discussed, with each category's respective growth rates, market values and
the value of the chemicals each uses given.  This section is intended to link
changes in the demand for finished cosmetic and toiletry products with
resulting changes in demand for the chemical ingredients from which they are
formulated.<P>

The final section reviews the major types of chemical ingredients.  The
present and likely future markets for these ingredients are analyzed, along
with their application to cosmetic formulations and trends affecting demand
for particular types of chemicals.  Estimates are given on significant usage
trends and growth rates.  These estimates take into account economics,
consumer preferences, demographic trends, product properties, competition and
government regulations.<P>


<B>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

Much of the information for this technical/marketing report has been gathered
through telephone interviews with industry partici- pants, including producers
of both cosmetic chemicals and finished cosmetic and toiletry products.  The
balance of the information comes from data obtained from available government,
trade and technical publications, as well as an evaluation of company
activities and patents.<P>

The value of U.S. manufacturers' sales for finished cosmetic and toiletry
products and for cosmetic ingredients are projected for the 1993-98 time
period.  The projections are given in 1993 constant dollars and cover the U.S.
geographic area.  The average annual growth rates conform to the convention
for significant figures.  Where precise information was not forthcoming, a
consensus was made, using a formulation of reasonable assumptions and
estimates based on a baseline obtained from historical data.<P>


<B>VALUE OF THIS REPORT</B><P>

This comprehensive technical/marketing report study will be of value to
technical personnel involved in the research and development of cosmetic
chemical ingredients, and manufacturers of finished cosmetic and toiletry
products.  Senior marketing, venture and planning executives, who must meet
federal standards on purity, will also benefit from this report.<P>

<B>STUDY GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

This technical/marketing study was prepared as an analysis to forecast and
trace the significant changes in the pesticide and agricultural chemical
business, as well as document the emerging trend toward integrated and low input agriculture.  Changes in the concepts of hard and soft pesticides are
coming about as the new biological pesticides become available.  This report
identifies these expanding technological innovations and identifies the impact
of governmental regulations and legislative actions.  It then identifies what
these developments mean for manufacturers, suppliers, and users of pesticides
and crop protection chemicals in terms of alternative agriculture.<P>

<B>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P>

Rapid changes are coming about in the conventional crop protection business as
well as in what chemicals are allowed for use.  This study identifies the
emergence of biological pesticides against a framework of alternative
agriculture and integrated pest management concepts.  This technical/marketing
report examines the viable alternatives to traditional hard (chemical)
pesticides in the form of biologically-based, or soft, pesticides. These are
presumably safer to the environment and less likely to cause resistance in
pest populations.  Pesticides, by type, include fungicides, insecticides, and
herbicides.  These compounds have continued to come under close government
scrutiny and public attack.<P> 

The crop protection chemical business remains a market sector that the world cannot adequately live without, and, on the other hand, one that the world is very uncomfortable living with.  While a boon to farmers and the world's food supply, many chemical-based pesticides persist in the environment long after they have served their purpose.  These toxic chemical residues may show up in the food we eat, the air we breathe, and the water we drink, posing serious health threats. Increasing public awareness of these dangers has prompted stricter government curbs on the chemical pesticides in both the U.S. and abroad.  Many insect and weed populations have developed resistance to chemical pesticides after years of use. Still, effective pest control is crucial to maintaining our food supply and the financial stability of the agricultural market.<P>

<B>SCOPE</B><P>

This technical/marketing report will quantify and qualify the market
information for biopesticides for specific geographic areas of the United
States.  Included are particular market sectors such as pyrethroids,
pheromones, microbials, and genetically engineered products.  Because of the
present dominant position of the pyrethrin/pyrethroids, the non-pyrethroids
are singled out in a summary.  This report identifies the state-of-the-art and
market value for biological pesticides in the U.S. and examines how this is
impacting agriculture in terms of low-input sustainable agriculture and
integrated pest management.  This is put into context by looking at the total
value of the U.S. pesticide market including both the chemical pesticides and
the newer concept soft pesticides.<P>

<B>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

The information for this study is drawn from interviews with individuals in
the companies involved with bringing the new biological pesticides to the
marketplace, literature searches, the patent literature, and government files
and records for the more traditional crop protection chemicals.  Historical
figures are for the year given. Insofar as possible, projections are based on
reasonable price assumptions for the use of the products.<P>

<B>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY</B><P>

Once it is realized that agricultural pests and diseases are not going to just
go away, then there can be some ordered program for coming to grips with the
problem without environmental or economic hysteria.  The crop protection
business continues to change because pests themselves elicit different
responses over time. As there is a general decline in the use and
profitability of the chemical pesticides, there is a rise in the new and more
profitable technology associated with biological controls.  New markets are
opening up in more effective control of agricultural pests.

This comprehensive technical/marketing study will be valuable to technical
personnel, those in research and development, as well as marketing and business
managers in the areas of crop protection chemicals.<P>

<H3><I>INTRODUCTION</I></H3>
</CENTER>

<B>STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

The study is designed to inform those with a stake in the
agricultural chemical and related industries about:<P>

1.   Important trends in domestic consumption, production, and
     prices of fertilizers and pesticides;<P>

2.   Major shifts in worldwide fertilizers and pesticides trade;<P>

3.   How the industry is structured, and how it is  rapidly
     changing; and<P>

4.   Opportunities for profiting from these trends and
     changes.<P>

It also provides information on forces influencing market trends
and industry structural changes such as:<P>

a)   Technology -- including the movement toward Low Input
     Sustainable Agriculture (LISA) and the role of competing
     methods of controlling pests and adding plant nutrients, e.g.,
     biotechnology and physical methods such as bug vacuums and
     infrared weed control;<P>

b)   Regulations -- such as the 1990 Farm Bill, the 1990 Clean Air
     Act, and various state laws;<P>

     Economics -- including the impact of rising oil prices and
     diminishing returns to farmers for additional inputs.<P>


<B>REASONS FOR THE STUDY</B><P>

Firstly, there is a growing public concern about potential dangers
of agricultural chemicals.  Unless when preempted by other crisis
messages like these are frequently on the nightly TV news, radio
commentary shows and newspaper headlines:<P>

     Nitrate from fertilizer contaminating public drinking
     water;<P>

     Pesticides detected in the ground water of 26 states;<P>

     Farm workers exposed to herbicides have six times the risks of
     non-Hodgkin lymphomas;<P>

     Cancer-producing, allergy-causing, immune system-alterizng
     pesticide residues found in food supply.<P>

Even though voters turned down most environmental ballot
initiatives during the November 1990 election, governments -
federal, state, and local - will still be under pressure to
legislate more restrictions and controls over agricultural
chemicals.<P>

Secondly, there is an expanding development of new technology and
farming practices that have the potential of changing the demand
for agricultural chemicals.  For example, Low Input Sustainable
Agriculture (LISA), practices are designed to reduce the
application of chemicals.  To what extent will farmers implement
LISA and to what extent will other new competing technologies be
adopted?<P>

Thirdly, both fertilizer and pesticides are sensitive to energy
prices, and recent rising and fluctuating oil prices, along with
other economic forces, will impact on the industry.<P>


<B>CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE STUDY AND FOR WHOM</B><P>

This report will be valuable to a wide variety of people interested
in or involved with the agricultural chemical industry.  The report
is designed to:<P>

     Help investors and lenders evaluate where the industry is
     going, and who the potential losers and winners may be;<P>

     Provide chemical producers with information useful in
     strategic planning and forecasting;<P>

     Help chemical brokers, distributors and farm cooperatives plan
     storage and distribution systems;<P>

     Assist industry trade associations evaluate the impact of
     environmental lobby groups;<P>

     Assist government policy makers design and evaluate chemical
     regulatory and price support programs;<P>

     Help farmers learn about new farming practices and trends.<P>

Overall, it should provide necessary facts and highlight issues to
help businesses and other people make better decisions.<P>


<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

Primarily this study covers fertilizers and pesticides used in crop
production.  To a lesser degree, it covers plant growth regulators
and miscellaneous agricultural chemicals.  It does not cover post
harvest crop, livestock, or dairy chemicals.<P>

Following this introductory chapter is Chapter II, an executive
summary highlighting the findings followed by:<P>

     Chapter III    An overview of the fertilizer and pesticide
                    sectors;<P>

     Chapter IV     Forecasts of domestic consumption, production,
                    and prices of fertilizers and pesticides;<P>

     Chapter V      Details of the industry structure, the major
                    firms, and what they are doing;<P>

     Chapter VI     Description of the 1990 Farm Bill, the
                    California initiatives and many other federal
                    and state regulations impacting on the
                    industry.<P>

     Chapter VII    Discussion of alternative agricultural
                    practices and new research on biotechnology,
                    more benign chemicals and more efficient
                    equipment for applying agricultural chemicals.<P>

     Chapter VIII   Analysis of the economic forces that influence
                    the supply and demand for agricultural
                    chemicals.<P>

     Chapter IX     Trends in agricultural chemical exports and
                    imports, and what is happening on the
                    international front.<P>

     References     Lists of more than 150 references: books,
                    articles, reports, etc.<P>


<B>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

This research is based on a review of the literature, a survey of
knowledgeable people, and collection and analysis of statistics -
the various sources listed in the next section.  A survey was made
of experts in 12 major agricultural producing states that consume
more than 50 per cent of the agricultural chemicals in this
country.  The experts include more than 40 county agricultural
extension agents, 20 state agricultural economists or other
specialists, and 20 specialists at the national levels from such
organizations as USDA, TVA, various think tanks, trade
associations, congressional staff, and environmental groups.  In
addition, some time series and limited regression analysis were
used.<P>

<B>STUDY GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

The goal of this report is to provide what we believe to be the
first detailed and comprehensive "multi-client" study ever of mold
release agents and their commerical potential.  The objectives
include a thorough coverage of the underlying technological and
environmental issues of the evolving mold release business, as well
as assessments of new and potential products.  Another important
objective is to provide realistic market data and forecasts on mold
release products and the end-use markets in which they are used.<P>

<B>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P>

The main reason for doing the study is that during the past five
years there have been a large number of new mold release product
introductions, as well as the rapid diffusion of semi-permanent
mold release technology and systems in the marketplace.  The
diffusion of semi-permanent mold release systems, which offer
multiple release capabilities, excellent surface finish properties,
scale economies and a variety of other advantages, have caused some
observers to predict that they will supplant more traditional
topical coatings.  This will be premature but, nonetheless,
semi-permanents will adversely impact the growth potential for
metallic stearates, synthetic waxes, polymer, silicone and other
topical coatings.<P>

In addition, environmental issues involving solvent emissions and
CFC propellents have placed the industry in a state of turmoil and
are leading to the development and diffusion of CFC alternatives,
water-based emulsions, and alternative methods of mold release
delivery.These issues are also promoting a shift to lubricants,
which are more environmentally sound.  Finally, there has been an
increase in the number of industry participants and most industry
observers maintain that mold releases is one market in which small
companies can still effectively compete and find unique market
opportunities.<P>

<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

The scope of the report is comprehensive, covering the present
status and future prospects for mold releases in the United States.<P>

It covers the many issues concerning the merits of and future
prospects of semi-permanent mold release technology in addition to
similar techno-economic issues dealing with topical coatings such
as parting agents, metallics stearates, soaps, waxes, and
silicones, among others.   In addition, the report covers the
applications and end-use markets in which these mold releases are
used.  It covers the environmental issues that so many regard as
critical to the industry's current state of change.  The report
provides an analysis of the market shares of suppliers along with
analysis of the structure of companies involved in producing
chemicals that are  formulated with other materials and packaged as
mold releases.  Lubricants, which are blended into polymer melts
and  are often the same chemical compounds (providing release
features) are  assessed for their impact on mold releases. The
competitive position of the main players in the market and the
strategic options they face are also discussed as well as such
competitive factors as marketing, technical services, distribution
and operations.  The roles of major multinational chemical
companies and vertical integration are considered as well.  The
report also looks at the varieties of basic research, product
development and commericalization that being conducted in the area
of mold releases.<P>

The study also covers slip agents and anti-blocking agents which
are related to mold releases.  Lubricants, another abherent
material related to mold releases, are not included, except in a
secondary sense.  Unless otherwise noted, all figures represent
consumption of these mold release products in million of pounds.
These figures include active ingredients only and exclude solvents,
oils, water and other materials that are blended with mold
releases.  As a result, the 54.3 million pounds of mold releases
consumed in 1989 were formulated with an additional 133 million
pounds of these other materials.  The value of consumption ($192
million in 1989) and sales, in million of dollars is at the level
of the final end-user.  At this level, a large portion of the cost
includes packaging, propellants and other materials.  As used in
this study, the term consumption is equivalent to, and used
interchangeably with the terms demand and sales.  During the
discussion of end-use markets, consumption is related to indicators
in the tables.  This does not imply that the indicator used
represents the sole end-use in that market (e.g., casting shipments
for metal processing markets).  Rather, it is used for comparative
purposes.  All growth rates mentioned in the tables and the text
are based on the average annual rate of growth from 1989 to 1994.
The compounding method is used.<P>

<B>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY<B/><P>

This study provides the most complete accounting of the ongoing
developments in mold releases currently available in a
"multi-client" study format.  It provides a most thorough and
up-to-date assessment that can be found anywhere on the subject.
The study also provides extensive quantification of the many
important facets of the market developments for mold release
agents.  This, in turn, contributes to the determination of what
kind of strategic response that firms may adopt in order to compete
in this dynamic market.<P>

<B>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

Initially, a comprehensive and exhaustive search for the literature
on mold releases was conducted.  These secondary sources included
trade journals, technical journals, on-line databases, product data
sheets, other product/promotional literature, annual reports, and
other publications.  In addition, there were some 50 formal and
informal interviews and discussions with end-users, chemical
distributors, plastic compounders, lubricant and other plastic
additive producers, technical experts, government officials, trade
association officials, and responsible officers, sales and
technical personnel of the mold releases companies themselves.<P>

<B>STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

Sorbent materials are used by many different industries for hun-
dreds, maybe even thousands, of diverse applications.  They are
currently being evaluated (or possibly reevaluated) for use in
applications such as reduction of air and water emissions, process
improvements, product purifications, and as catalysts.  As a result
of the growing use of sorbents in these as well as other
areas, improved materials and processes are rapidly being devel-
oped.  In this two-volume study, BCC presents both new and well-
established technologies and materials that have been and are
being developed.<P>


<B>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P>

There is an incredible amount of information available on this
topic, with new products being introduced, it seems, almost daily.
Because of this, BCC performed the study in order to provide a
comprehensive reference for those involved with or interested in
sorbent materials and technologies.  BCC sorted through and con-
densed information from vast quantities of company literature,
published articles, and reference materials to compile this
report.<P>


<B>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY AND FOR WHOM</B><P>

This report is intended to assist those involved in the design of
sorption systems and products, selection of materials, purchasing
or using these systems, as well as financial analysts responsible
for evaluating companies involved in this industry.  BCC feels
that this comprehensive report will be invaluable to technical
personnel, as well as marketing and business managers in the
following areas:<P>

  -  Companies involved in the development, manufacturing, mining,
     or distribution of sorbent products,<P>

  -  State and federal government personnel within the Environmen-
     tal Protection Agency, Bureau of Mines, and Occupational
     Safety and Health Administration with responsibilities per
     taining to these materials,<P>

  -  Organizations involved in applied or basic research,<P>

  -  Financial institutions and venture capitalists interested in
     emerging technologies with large growth potential as well as
     identifying areas of potential trouble.<P>

<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

This two-volume report covers the technology, economic, and
environmental considerations of the sorbent industry.  This is
primarily a study of the U.S. market, but noteworthy international
activities are also included.  The forecasts are given in constant
U.S. dollars and the growth rates are compounded.<P>

Volume I includes:<P>

  -  General sorption applications,<BR>
  -  U.S. markets with forecasts through 1995,<BR>
  -  Industry structure and players,<BR>
  -  Selected company profiles,<BR>
  -  Economic and pricing information,<BR>
  -  International issues,<BR>
  -  Environmental, safety, and regulatory concerns,<BR>
  -  Company directory by material and by application,<BR>
  -  Alphabetical directory of companies.<P>


Volume II includes:<P>

  -  Sorption mechanisms and terminology,<BR>
  -  Process technologies,<BR>
  -  Materials and their specific applications,<BR>
  -  Patent and literature reviews.<P>


<B>METHODOLOGY AND INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

Online and manual searches were made of the literature, including
technical, trade, and government publications.  Product and market
information came directly from the companies involved whenever
possible.  Company profile information was obtained from published
directories, articles, and from the companies themselves.

<B>STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

Sorbent materials are used by many different industries for hundreds,
maybe even thousands, of diverse applications.  They are
currently being evaluated (or possibly reevaluated) for use in
applications such as reduction of air and water emissions, process
improvements, product purifications, and as catalysts.  As a result
of the growing use of sorbents in these as well as other areas,
improved materials and processes are rapidly being developed.  In
this two-volume study, BCC presents both new and well-established
technologies and materials that have been and are being developed.<P>



<B>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P>

There is an incredible amount of information available on this
topic, with new products being introduced, it seems, almost daily.
Because of this, BCC performed the study in order to provide a
comprehensive reference for those involved with or interested in
sorbent materials and technologies.  BCC sorted through and condensed
information from vast quantities of company literature,
published articles, and reference materials to compile this report.<P>



<B>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY AND FOR WHOM</B><P>

This report is intended to assist those involved in the design of
sorption systems and products, selection of materials, purchasing or
using these systems, as well as financial analysts responsible for
evaluating companies involved in this industry.  BCC feels that this
comprehensive report will be invaluable to technical personnel, as
well as marketing and business managers in the following areas:<P>

     -  Companies involved in the development, manufacturing,
mining,
        or distribution of sorbent products,<P>

  -  State and federal government personnel within the Environmental
 Protection Agency, Bureau of Mines, and Occupational
        Safety and Health Administration with responsibilities per
        taining to these materials,<P>

     -  Organizations involved in applied or basic research,<P>

     -  Financial institutions and venture capitalists interested in
     emerging technologies with large growth potential as well as
     identifying areas of potential trouble.<P>

<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

This two-volume report covers the technology, economic, and
environmental considerations of the sorbent industry.  This is
primarily a study of the U.S. market, but noteworthy international
activities are also included.  The forecasts are given in constant
U.S. dollars and the growth rates are compounded.<P>

Volume I includes:<P>

  -  General sorption applications<BR>
<MENU>-  U.S. markets with forecasts through 1995<BR>
     -  Industry structure and players<BR>
     -  Selected company profiles<BR>
     -  Economic and pricing information</MENU><BR>
  -  International issues<BR>
<MENU>-  Environmental, safety, and regulatory concerns<BR>
     -  Company directory by material and by application</MENU><BR>
-  Alphabetical directory of companies<P>


Volume II includes:<P>

-  Sorption mechanisms and terminology<BR>
-  Process technologies<BR>
-  Materials and their specific applications<BR>
-  Patent and literature reviews<P>


<B>METHODOLOGY AND INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

Online and manual searches were made of the literature, including
technical, trade, and government publications.  Product and market
information came directly from the companies involved whenever
possible.  Company profile information was obtained from published
directories, articles, and from the companies themselves.<P>

<B>STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

In the U.S., there is a growing awareness of the impact of
chemicals, oils, hazardous materials, and infectious or toxic
materials on people and the environment.  Federal and state
regulations regarding spills and the disposal of sorbent materials
used to clean them up (also used in the disposal of liquid waste)
are becoming more restrictive.  Generators are responsible for the
proper handling of the chemicals they use and the wastes they
produce.  This makes it more important than ever for companies to be
well informed of the strengths and weaknesses of the different
sorbent technologies, and the products and services that are
available.  An important issue that should be considered when
selecting sorbents and stabilization agents is that all industries
are now required to actively pursue waste minimization, resource
recovery and recycling.  Careful selection of sorbents utilized
frequently for clean-up of various leaks and spills can potentially
reduce the quantity of waste that must be landfilled.  Selection of
the proper sorbent material is also important because of personnel
protection, fire, safety, and other hazards that may exist in
specific situations.  This report presents information regarding
sorbent and solidification materials used for industrial leaks,
spills, and other liquid waste.  It also covers materials used for
medical and consumer applications such as for water and body fluid
absorption.<P>


<B>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P>

This report is intended for those involved in the selection of
sorbent materials to help them make an informed decision regarding
the many different choices that are available.  BCC also feels that
this report is extremely important because end users, without a good
base knowledge of materials and their limitations, can purchase
products that are not the most efficient and economical choice for
their application.  Also, in some cases, fire and safety hazards
exist when these products are used on certain chemicals.<P>


<B>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY AND FOR WHOM</B><P>

BCC feels that this comprehensive, single-source report will be
invaluable to technical personnel, as well as marketing and business
managers in the following areas:<P>

<DD>- Companies involved in development, manufacturing, mining, or
       distribution of sorbent products and the materials that are
       used to produce them;</DD><BR>
<DD>-  State and federal government personnel within the
       Environmental Protection Agency, Department of
       Transportation, and Occupational Safety and Health
       Administration with responsibilities pertaining to these
       materials;</DD><BR>
<DD>-  Generators of hazardous waste, including laboratories, clean
        rooms, manufacturing sites, loading sites, transport trucks,
        hospitals, and public buildings;</DD><BR>
<DD>-  Organizations involved in applied or basic research;</DD><BR>
<DD>-  Financial institutions and venture capitalists interested in
        emerging technologies with large growth potential, as well as
        identifying areas of potential trouble.</DD><P>


<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

This report covers the technology, economic, and environmental
considerations of the sorbent industry.  This is primarily a study
of the U.S. market, but noteworthy international activities are also
included.  The forecasts are given in constant U.S. dollars, and the
growth rates are compounded.<P>

<B>SCOPE</B><P>

This technical/marketing report examines the growth and changes
taking place in the market for replacements to chlorofluorocarbons
(CFCs). Replacements include recycling efforts, alternative
chemicals that contain halogen or "alternatives (in-kind)," and
substitutes (not-in-kind). This report concentrates on strategic
changes in the replacements for CFCs.  New developments are almost
a daily occurrence in portions of this industry.  Never before has
the market for CFCs faced such a challenge. Bans and reduced
consumption demands occur almost weekly, yet the suitable
replacements for these chemicals are not all in place.<P>

Certain sectors are under increasing government regulation and
public scrutiny. Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), the leading
alternative, could be phased out by 2015 and banned by 2030.  For
U.S. producers, a decline on CFC production is in effect. Many
foreign producers have met restrictions by simply eliminating
aerosol uses for CFCs.  The U.S. banned nearly all aerosol use of
CFCs in the 1970s. The latest version of the Montreal Protocol and
the Clean Air Act phase out CFCs, Halons, and carbon tetrachloride
by 2000 and methyl chloroform by 2005.<P>


<B>MATERIALS AND TECHNOLOGY</B><P>

This technical/marketing report is based on information from the
various companies involved and the numerous agencies, public and
private, that monitor the use of fluorochemicals. Mandated taxes on
the CFCs have doubled and tripled the prices and by the year 2000
will be part of a ten-fold increase in the selling price of the
remaining CFC production.<P>

It continues to be difficult to enter the materials end of the
fluorine compounds business because the technology involved is both
dangerous and expensive and the established major producers are
well integrated. The  force that  kept companies in the business of
fluorochemicals was the lucrative profit margins. Now billions may
be spent on R&D and testing to regain just a portion of the CFC
market. The properties of the fluorine compounds are in many cases
unique to certain applications: their stability, chemical and
thermal resistance, and inflammability.<P>

<B>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

The organization of the chemicals is to present the compounds in a
way that best reflects the marketplace and the dominant compounds.
Hydrogen fluoride (HF) is given a separate line-item listing to
reflect its unique status and is one of the few compounds beside
the CFCs that the U.S. government keeps statistics on.  Use was
made of the most recent government information on CFCs. Information
from both the International Trade Commission and the EPA.<P>

Information beyond government statistics is a result of producers
and suppliers sharing their perceptions with us. Interviewees also
tried to verify and augment our data. The selling prices which are
the key to the "value" figures for the various compounds represent
a scenario that comes fairly close to a consensus that it allows
the chemical companies a reasonable profit margin to recoup the
large R&D  and capital expenses of the new chemicals, and is still
at a level that the majority of users can afford.<P>

<B>CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE STUDY</B><P>

This technical/marketing report will be of value to anyone in
government or industry who is involved in monitoring or producing
alternatives for CFCs, or recycling systems or CFCs, CFCs, or other
fluorine-containing chemicals. Companies engaged in the marketing
of other fluorine compounds for industrial or medical uses will
also find this a useful document, in terms of evaluating their own
market for expansion opportunities, and keeping abreast of new
products and technologies. The alternatives to CFCs must be put in
the total context of the continuing green movement and total
environmental safety.<P>

<B>STUDY GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

This new Business Communications Co. report provides an in-depth analysis of new cleaning and soldering materials for the
electronics industry as it pertains to the manufacture and cleaning
of electronic assemblies.  New chemicals analyzed are solder
pastes, fluxes, rosins, cleaners and solvents and environmentally
safe alternative chemicals.  The study features in-depth analyses
of the higher performance requirements of products, applications,
markets and marketers.<P>

Case studies of user concerns, as well as worldwide materials
market size, growth and usage trends through the year 1998, will
show suppliers to the industry the paths to business opportunity
while end-users will benefit from knowing about the new products
and their suppliers.<P>

Solder pastes and cleaners are a relatively small market in
themselves compared to the total value of materials for
electronics.  However, they are the "tail that wags the dog" for
surface joining and product reliability and appearance.
Cleaning in electronics is in a state of "flux" as the industry
seeks new solutions.  The electronics industry is approaching a
cleaning crisis in response to the toxicity issue of chlorinated
fluorocarbons (CFCs).  Concerns about atmospheric greenhouse
effects and ozone depletion have resulted in the banning of the
most common materials used to clean electronic assemblies.
Additionally, the reduced standoff clearances of new assembly
technology, such as SMT, have made cleaning more difficult.
Together, these factors are forcing the development of new
materials, processes and equipment for soldering and cleaning.<P>

Electronic chemicals and materials are the fundamental technology
at the heart of today's electronics products.  Electronic
components with very high functional density and component
performance requirements demand unique and innovative approaches
which address electrical, thermal and mechanical material concerns.
Current indicators show that advanced fine-line approaches will
drive electronic materials for the 1990s through the 21st century.<P>

This BCC electronic materials technology report analyzes the
current and future materials for soldering, cleaning and assembly
within the context of shifting geophysical forces which will
determine the future industry winners.<P>


<B>CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE STUDY AND FOR WHOM</B><P>

The report provides a thorough analysis of the conventional
soldering and cleaning materials industry, and then provides a
comparison of advanced materials and substitute processes, to
accommodate new imaging technology, fine-line and high-speed
devices.  The study discusses the global electronic materials
industry structure, describing activities of the players in the
U.S., Europe, Asia and the rest of the world.  Worldwide material
consumption is tabulated and market forecasts are provided by type
of material through the year 1998.  Environmental issues, case
studies and winning strategies are presented with an eye to the
21st century.<P>

<B>STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

This BCC report is an invaluable technical/economic review intended
for those involved in the surfactants industry.  It is a
comprehensive single-source document that provides a broad base of
technical information as well as an evaluation of the market,
players, and products.<P>

In this report, BCC attempts to provide an objective view of the
actual consumption patterns in this industry.  We analyze the market
data in three ways:  by charge, chemical, and application.  By
charge, we provide a detailed analysis of sales (volume and value)
and production (volume) data.  In addition, we provide information
on selected individual surfactants and a breakdown of the market by
application.<P>


<B>BACKGROUND INFORMATION</B><P>

Surfactants reduce the surface tension of water or other solvents.
They are produced from natural fats and oils; from silvichemicals
such as lignin, rosin, and tall oil; or from chemical intermediates
derived from coal tar and petroleum.  They function as dispersing
agents, emulsifiers, foaming agents, and wetting agents.<P>

Surfactants are widely used in both consumer and industrial
applications.  Consumer applications include soaps and cleaners,
laundry detergents, cosmetics, and toiletries.  Non-consumer
applications are found in almost every industry and, except for
cleaning uses, most consume minute quantities as processing aids.
Industries where they are used include rubber, plastics, textiles,
civil engineering and construction, petroleum drilling, ore-
processing, food processing, medicines and pharmaceuticals,
herbicides, paper and pulp, machinery, and metals.<P>


<B>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P>

There is a major upheaval occurring in the surfactants industry.  It
appears that almost every product where they are used, especially in
the consumer market, has been recently reformulated. These
reformulations are a result of new demands that are being placed on
these chemicals, and the products that contain them, by users as
well as by federal, state, and local governments.<P>

There are several main driving forces behind the changes that are
occurring in the industry.  These forces include:  the economy;
demands for generally "green" products that are milder, safer, and
cheaper; high expenses due, in particular, to regulatory compliance,
insurance, and environmental-related expenses; technical
obsolescence; erosion of commodity/specialty segment
differentiation; and the public perception of the chemical industry
in general.<P>

Because about half of the surfactants produced in the U.S. are used
in the detergent (both consumer and industrial) and personal care
markets, the industry is heavily influenced by regulatory
requirements, and consumer demands and trends.  Growing public
concerns over the environment, or the "green" movement, are causing
surfactants to have a more critical role in laundry and cleaning
products.<P>

There is a growing demand from consumers for mild, biodegradable,
non-toxic products that are made from natural raw materials.
Changes are also being brought on by their desire to decrease energy
consumption by the reduction of washing and cleaning temperatures.
Consumers are demanding a reduced number of products, achieved
through multifunctionality, in an effort to save money and to lower
the quantity of chemicals added to the wastewater.<P>

More stringent regulatory requirements in the areas of ecology and
toxicology are also starting to affect industrial and consumer usage
as well.  Government regulations are having wide ranging effects.
Volatile organic compound (VOC) restrictions are affecting
formulations of widely varying products from cosmetics and
toiletries, which use alcohol, to paints and adhesives.  These
regulations are causing a shift to water-based systems, which need
different surfactants than solvent-based systems.  VOC regulations
impact product performance and characteristics such as "dry time"
and aesthetics.<P>

In addition, new products are being developed for new or changing
industrial applications.  Surfactants are beginning to attract
attention in energy and environmental protection applications.  They
are being tried in pollution-control systems, paper processing, and
ultra-thin films.  They are also being evaluated in sintering of
superconducting ceramics, and in medical applications such as blood
substitutes for transfusions.  Industrial cleaning products are
being reformulated to make them more environmentally friendly and
safer to use.  There also seems to be some emphasis on making them
easier for non-English-speaking personnel to use.<P>


<B>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY AND FOR WHOM</B><P>

This BCC study is intended for those involved in the surfactants and
surfactant-containing product industry.  It will be especially
useful to those performing research and development, sales and
marketing, and surfactant selection and specification.  It will also
be useful to financial analysts who are responsible for evaluating
companies involved in the industry as well as government analysts
whose responsibility is to track these chemicals.<P>

BCC feels that this comprehensive two-part (market analysis and
technical review) report will be invaluable to technical personnel
as well as marketing and business managers of companies involved in
the following areas:<P>

<UL>
-  Companies involved in the development, manufacturing,
        and distribution of surfactants and surfactant-based
        products<P>
     -  Industrial surfactant users<P>
     -  Organizations involved in applied or basic research<P>
     -  Financial institutions and venture capitalists<P>
     -  Government analysts</UL><P>


<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

</CENTER>


This report describes the markets and technology for imaging and associated chemicals in the production of integrated circuits and printed circuit boards.  These products consist of photoresists, developers, strippers, etchants and related materials. Photoresists are defined as organic coatings activated by light patterns so that those precise, thin lines can be formed on the coated surface.<P> 

<B>STUDY GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

The object of this study is to describe the composition of photoresists and 
how they are applied and developed, to provide information on the market size 
and producers of these coatings, and to forecast technological developments 
and market growth.<P> 


<b>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P>

This study is an in-depth examination of the photoresist industry.  Electronic 
chemicals and materials are the fundamental technology at the heart of today's 
electronic products. Therefore, developments in photoresist technology are at 
the center of the thrust to pack more and more capability in integrated 
circuits and printed circuit boards.  Line widths are the critical factor and 
the full thrust of research and development in photoresists is to keep 
reducing these line widths.<P>

This BCC analytical tool covers the new technologies in terms of materials, 
processes and applications.  The chapters reveal the emerging technologies and 
then make analytical market and industry forecasts that identify paths to new 
and profitable business opportunities.  An extensive directory of suppliers 
provides a one-stop source for microelectronic material needs.<P> 


<b>METHODOLOGY AND INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

Data are based on a thorough review of electronic materials technology based on a systematic review of developments through telephone and in-person reviews and an extensive data base of technical and marketing sources.<P>

<B>STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

The goal of this report is to provide a detailed and comprehensive
multi-client study of pulp and paper chemicals and their commercial
potential.  The objectives include a thorough coverage of the
underlying technological and environmental issues of the pulp and
paper chemicals business, as well as assessments of new and
potential products and systems.  Another important objective is to
provide realistic market data and forecasts for pulp and paper
chemicals.<P>


<B>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P>

The main reason for doing this study is that during the past five
years there has been a large number of  changes in which chemicals
are used in manufacturing pulp, paper, and paperboard, as well as
changes in the pulp and paper industry itself.  In large part,
these changes revolve around issues concerning the environment.
The growth of recycling has promoted the increased use of
lower-cost secondary fibers at the expense of virgin fibers.  In
many ways this will aid the competitiveness of domestic pulp and
paper producers.  On the other hand, concern over dioxin discharges
and trace amounts in paper products have promoted the use of sodium
chlorate, hydrogen peroxide, oxygen, and other bleaching agents and
systems at the expense of chlorine.   Recent directions in the
legislative and regulatory arena indicate that environmental
pressures on dioxin and other issues--including clean water and
solid wastes--will intensify in the years to come, engendering
further changes in the pulp and paper chemical business.<P>


<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

The scope of this report is comprehensive, covering the present
status of and future prospects for pulp and paper chemicals in the
United States.  It covers the many issues concerning the merits and
future prospects of pulping and bleaching chemicals, as well as
pigments, fillers, strengthening agents, sizing agents, defoamers,
biocides, and other paper additives.  In addition, the report
covers pulp, paper, and paperboard markets and products in which
these chemicals are used.  It also covers in detail the
environmental issues that so many regard as critical to the
industry's current state of change.  The report provides an
analysis of the market shares, along with an analysis of the
structure of companies involved in producing pulp and paper
chemicals.  The competitive position of the main players in the
market and the strategic options they face are also discussed, as
well as such competitive factors as marketing, technical services,
distribution, and operations.  The roles of major multinational
chemical companies and vertical integration by forest product
companies are considered as well.  The report also looks at the
varieties of basic research, product development, and
commercialization that are being conducted in the area of pulp and
paper chemicals.<P>

Unless noted otherwise, all figures represent consumption of these
pulp and paper chemicals in either thousands of short tons (of
2,000 pounds each) or less frequently, in millions of pounds.  The
value of consumption ($3.6 billion) of pulp and paper chemicals by
the pulp and paper industry, in millions of dollars,  represents
the price of product shipped from the manufacturer's plant site.
These prices exclude the cost of freight and insurance.  Thus,
prices do not reflect list prices, but actual transaction prices
between a chemical producer and the pulp or paper mill.  As used in
this study, the term consumption is equivalent to, and used
interchangeably with, the terms demand and sales.  During the
discussion of individual chemical products, consumption is related
to indicators in the table.  This does not imply that the indicator
used represents the sole application of that chemical in the pulp
and paper industry.  Rather, it is used for comparative purposes,
and often rather broad indicators (i.e., wood pulp production) are
used.  For example, lime (or calcium oxide) is used predominantly
during pulping (for the recovery of caustic soda from soda ash in
green liquor), but has also been used in bleaching (in the
preparation of calcium hypochlorite).   All growth rates mentioned
in the tables and in the text are based on the average annual rate
of growth from 1991 through 1996.  The compounding method is used.<P>


<B>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY</B><P>

This study provides the most complete accounting of ongoing
developments in pulp and paper chemicals  currently available in a
multi-client format.  It provides the most thorough and up-to-date
assessment that can be found anywhere on the subject.  The study
also provides extensive quantification of the many important facets
of the market developments for pulp and paper chemicals.  This, in
turn, contributes to the determination of what kind of strategic
response companies may adopt in order to compete in this dynamic
market.<P>


<B>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

Initially, a comprehensive and exhaustive search of the literature
on pulp and paper chemicals was conducted.  These secondary sources
included technical journals, technical books, product material
safety data sheets, other product/promotional literature, annual
reports, 10-K reports, and other publications.  In addition, there
were some 50 formal and informal interviews with pulp and paper
producers, technical experts, government officials, trade
association officials, and the sales and technical personnel of the
pulp and paper chemical companies themselves.<P>

<H3><I>INTRODUCTION</I></H3>
</CENTER>

<B>OBJECTIVES AND GOALS</B><P>

The objectives of this report are to: (a) Identify the catalysts
for organic synthesis, the suppliers and users; (b) Estimate and
forecast the quantities and dollar values of U.S. catalyst
consumption for organic synthesis, by catalyst type and by
application; (c) Elucidate the forces for market and technological
change with respect to catalysts for organic synthesis, and assess
their impact.<P>

The goals of this report are to shed light on a topic of major
importance and to provide executive management with a basis for
further consideration in making business plans.<P>

<B>REASONS FOR STUDY AND ITS CONTRIBUTION</B><P>

The catalyst supply industry and users of catalysts for organic
synthesis now face both market and technological challenges, as
well as opportunities. The next several years will prove to be
dynamic for the catalyst industry, with new and shifting demands
for synthesized organic chemicals, cost containment issues,
environmental concerns, stereoselectivity, chiral technology and
biotechnology playing significant roles.<P>

This report presents a timely examination of the changing role
catalysts play in the manufacture of organic chemicals. The study
also details the ways in which catalysts address some of the most
important problems facing the chemical industry as it confronts a
new world order of business competition.<P>

The major objective of this BCC report is to illuminate a topic
which is poorly documented in business literature.. While most
studies discussing catalysts focus mainly on petroleum refining and
pollution control applications, this BCC study focuses exclusively
on catalysts for organic synthesis, encompassing primary and
intermediate petrochemicals, polymers and the many performance and
specialty organic chemicals. BCC also contributes by integrating
perspectives in chemical catalysis and biocatalysis.<P>

<B>AUDIENCE</B><P>

This report is written specifically for a business audience of
executives, business managers, marketing managers, product managers
and business-minded scientists. It is not a science text. Expected
readers of this report include catalyst suppliers, catalyst users,
catalyst support materials suppliers, and those who may be
considering entrance into the catalyst industry.<P>

<B>SCOPE AND CONTENT</B><P>

This report concerns catalysts for organic chemical synthesis,
(i.e., organic "chemical processing") and excludes catalysts for
petroleum refining, pollution control, inorganic chemicals
synthesis and non-synthesis applications of catalysts.<P>

The OVERVIEW of Chapter I provides a concise, broad view of
catalysts and the catalyst business. Chapter II discusses the MAJOR
ISSUES facing the catalyst business today, particularly as regards
organic synthesis, and its major directions in the future. Chapter
III details the CATALYST INDUSTRY STRUCTURE AND DYNAMICS, and
identifies key players. Chapter IV on CATALYST PRODUCTS provides
details, quantified estimates and forecasts of U.S. consumption and
value, on all the major categories, including: acid catalysts, base
catalysts, metal catalysts, metallocenes, nonmetal catalysts,
zeolite catalysts, free-radical initiators, phase-transfer
catalysts, biocatalysts and the new biomimetics. Chapter V on
CATALYST APPLICATIONS covers primary petrochemicals and
petrochemical intermediates, polymers, fats and oils, surfactants
and plasticizers, fuel additives, pharmaceuticals, pesticides,
flavor and aroma chemicals, rubber-processing chemicals,
lubricating oil and grease additives, color chemicals, photographic
chemicals, textile and tanning chemicals, carbohydrates, amino
acids, peptides, oligonucleotides, and other organic chemicals.
Chapter VI provides an overview of CATALYST SCIENCE and the latest
technological developments. Chapter VII PROFILES COMPANIES in
catalyst supply. Four APPENDIXES complete this study.<P>

<B>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

This study results from three months of focused and extensive
research into the subject. Primary sources of information were
telephone interviews with a wide range of catalyst suppliers and
users (both domestic and foreign), and foreign correspondences,
with over fifty primary contacts. Extensive secondary sources of
information were also utilized, including company reports, product
literature, trade literature, computerized in-house patent searches
and readings of the scientific and technical literature.<P>

All analyses are made independently and objectively, without the
bias of vested interests. Mentions of products are not
endorsements, and omissions, if any, are unintentional. Estimates
of quantities and values of catalysts consumed refer to the U.S.
marketplace. Unless otherwise noted, all estimates and forecasts
refer to the United States. Rationales for estimates are provided,
and assumptions clearly stated. Given the proprietary nature of
some information, we expect knowledgeable readers to supplement our
analyses with their special insights.<P>

Quantities are expressed in pounds (lbs.), where 1 lb. = 453.59
grams, 1000 grams = 1 kilogram, 2000 lbs. = 1 ton, 1 metric ton =
1000 kilograms = 2205 lbs., and 14.58 troy ounces = 1 lb.  Sales
and value are expressed in U.S. 1991 dollars, where $1 = 100c, $1
MM = $1 million = $1 x 106, and foreign currencies have been
converted to U.S. dollars at prevailing exchange rates. Forecasts
are expressed in constant 1991 dollars to reflect real changes
without inflation, and assume constant prices. Valuations of
catalysts refer to ready-to-use products. The average annual growth
rate (AAGR) is derived by the compounding method.<P>

<B>GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

The market for separations, in general, is quite large and has the potential to become even larger.
Any 
industry using pure water or chemicals is a possible market, as are those industries which produce
waste 
materials or purify and concentrate various liquids and gases. Market opportunities are expanding
due to 
improved technology and greater energy savings. Increased enforcement of waste cleanup
legislation, 
along with the skyrocketing cost of traditional technologies, has provided an opportunity for the 
separations industry.<P>

The field of separation science continues to grow and evolve. Researchers in university and
industrial 
laboratories continue to explore, develop and improve processes and technologies. The goal of
this report 
is to examine novel techniques for separations and to analyze the market for these techniques. A
few of 
the processes described in this report are already available commercially, and have become well
known. 
Others are still in the research phase and are somewhat obscure.<P>


This report serves as in introduction to state-of-the-art separations techniques. A process
description is 
given for each technique, along with historical background, applications, and patent information
when 
available. The report will be of interest to those who wish  to keep up with the breakthroughs and 
improvements going on in separation science, and provide market projections for those interested
in exploring commercialization opportunities. <P>


<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

This report analyzes the markets, technologies and companies involved in various novel
separations such 
as exsorption, supercritical fluids, field flow fractionation, and magnetic separations. The
technologies are 
each in a different phase of development, from strictly research to full commercialization. Specific
product 
information will be covered when available.<P>

Each of the processes introduced in this report offers the opportunity to expand the potential of
separation 
science. Values given for markets are generally based on the best estimates of those involved in
the 
commercialization of the techniques. There are many factors to consider when launching new
technology, 
not the least being the characteristics of the targeted industry application. Some fields welcome
new 
technology with open arms, while others are more conservative in nature. Competition from other 
processes, both novel and established, also play a part in the success or failure of a technique.<P>

Values of the markets in this report are for the year given, represent sales by companies selling
into the 
marketplace, and are for the United States only. Projections are in terms of constant dollars and
represent 
real influence on the U.S. market sector. For the technologies discussed in this
technical/marketing report, 
the United Sates is the leader in both commercial application and R&D.<P>


<B>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

<B>STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

BCC's goal in conducting this study was to determine the current
worldwide status of the market for reprographics materials, and
assess the growth potential over a five-year period from 1991 to
1996.  We were particularly interested in the changing structure of
materials brought about by environmental regulations and the
growing use of electronic composition and publishing systems.<P>

Our major objective was to present a comprehensive analysis of the
current reprographic materials industry and plot its future course.<P>

<B>REASONS FOR DOING THIS STUDY</B><P>

Over the past decade, legislation to improve the environment
through decreased emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs)
and restriction of substances in waste water streams, has caused
many industries, including reprographics, to change some of the
materials used in their products.  The increased utilization of
electronics has also changed materials requirements, especially in
the prepress area of the business.<P>

BCC decided to examine the current position of the materials used
in reprographics technology.  We were interested to find out what
kinds of inks, solvents, films and plates are being used to meet
the demands of a changing environment.<P>

<B>CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE STUDY AND FOR WHOM</B><P>

We assembled a study of four major categories of materials used in
reprographics: printing and packaging inks, toners, prepress
materials, and press cleaners and washes.  We present a worldwide
industry structure, examine the competitive aspects of the
industry, analyze the current markets, and project shipments for
each of the material categories to 1996.  This study will be of
interest to those who manufacture printing inks and the various
chemicals used in their composition, prepress equipment and
materials, electronic composition and publishing systems, toners
and duplicating equipment, and cleaning and maintenance materials
for printing presses.<P>

<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

The scope of our study encompasses the four major components of
inks: pigments, vehicles, solvents and additives.  We also examine
the major kinds of prepress materials: photocomposition paper, film
and developers; and printing plates.  Two other
materials are explored: toners and pressroom cleaners.  We also
analyze the growth potential of the five major kinds of printing
technologies used for printing and packaging: letterpress,
lithography, flexography, gravure and screen printing; and present
forecasts for growth to 1996.  Technological issues are reviewed.
Other influential factors, such as past growth and the effects of
a slower economic climate, are also discussed.<P>

Because this is a worldwide industry, BCC analyzes the domestic and
international environmental regulatory situations and their impact
on the business.  We also assess economic indicators and their
possible effects on the industry.  BCC presents an analysis of the
driving forces within the printing and packaging market segments
using these reprographic materials and looks at the impact of these
forces for the future.<P>

We also review the size and status of in-house publishing
organizations within the domestic environment and the kinds of ink
and toner they use in their printing operations.  Future
consumption of these materials by in-house publishers is also
estimated.<P>

<B>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

BCC presents an analysis of the value of reprographic material
shipments by each major category.  Domestic material consumption is
detailed; worldwide consumption is added for each category.
Our estimated value is what manufacturers and materials providers
have paid in current dollars.  Then, based on our surveys, we
analyze applications of these materials, calculate an estimate for
growth, and forecast shipments for 1996.<P>

<B>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

BCC surveyed approximately 75 companies to obtain the data for this
report.  Included were manufacturers of chemicals, inks and toners,
prepress systems and materials, and electronic systems; commercial
printers, corporate publishing departments and distributors of
printed materials.  We also included several trade associations,
the U.S. Department of Commerce, and data from financial and
industry sources.<P>

</CENTER>

This report presents the findings of an analysis of the U. S.
market for selected raw materials used in environmentally
acceptable coatings, inks, and adhesives. Because of increasingly
restrictive government regulations on emissions of volatile
organic compounds (VOCs), and consequent changes in formulations
to reduce or eliminate the use of organic solvents, the materials
used have been undergoing profound changes.<P>

<B>STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

This report seeks to describe and to quantify the changes in
materials used by these industries in a detailed analysis. The
emphasis will be on future trends, changing technology, and
opportunities.<P>

The major objectives of the study are as follows:<P>

<UL><LI> To make available the most current and reliable
       information on the consumption of selected raw materials
       by coatings, inks, and adhesives.<P>

<LI> To forecast the market for these materials, broken down
       insofar as possible by industry, specific raw material,
       and type of environmentally acceptable formulation.<P>

<LI> To identify the most rapidly changing applications and
       the reasons for their growth or decline.<P>

<LI> To describe the major trends in the end uses.<P>

<LI> To provide profiles of the most important suppliers of
       raw materials.</UL><P>

<B>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P>

There have been few studies of the critical raw materials
employed in the environmentally acceptable versions of coatings,
inks, and adhesives. There is a need to update existing
information.<P>

<B>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY</B><P>
This study should be useful to companies interested in supplying
chemical raw materials to this field, and to manufacturers of
coatings, inks, and adhesives, who may wish to keep abreast of
current developments and economics.<P>

<B>SCOPE</B><P>

This report will be limited to products that are most affected by
regulations that are gradually eliminating the use of organic
solvents: latex emulsions, water-dispersible synthetic resins,
monomers, oligomers, and photoinitiators. Such materials as
additives, pigments, solvents, and drying oils will not be
covered. Hot-melt adhesives are also excluded.<P>
<B>
METHODOLOGY AND SOURCES OF INFORMATION</B><P>

Information on market size, growth rates, technological trends,
and the impact of government regulations was obtained from
interviews with suppliers of the materials in question.
Interviews were also conducted with trade associations.<P>

Secondary sources include reviews of published data from the
Government and other sources, and of pertinent trade journals,
such as "American Paint and Coatings Journal," "Adhesives Age,"
"American Inkmake," "Chemical Marketing Reporter," and "Chemical
Week."<P>

Product literature from selected major suppliers was also
reviewed.<P>

<B>UNITS</B><P>

The forecast growth rates were based, to some extent, on BCC
studies listed below:<P>

<B>REASONS FOR DOING STUDY</B><P>

This technical/marketing study was prepared as an in-depth analysis
to forecast and track significant changes in the chelate and
clathrate business and technology.  A wide spectrum of applications
is generating high interest in these compounds.<P>

Short definitions of chelates and clathrates are provided below in
order to clarify the contents of this study.<P>

A chelate is a chemical that will perform chelation, defined as the
reaction between a metal ion and the complexing agent, resulting in
formation of ring structures in corporating the ion.<P>

A Clathrate is a cage structure capable of including another
compound within its own structure.<P>

Chelates are used in a myriad of products to control adverse
effects of trace metal contamination, ranging from hairspray to
industrial boilers.  There are four types of chelates utilized--the
family of ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid products, phosphonates,
gluconates and citric acid.  This study also includes the use of
phosphates as sequestering agents (a process closely allied to
chelation).<P>

Although use of chelates is a technology developed over a period of
60 years, new applications are continually being found, as
evidenced by the large number of patents being issued.  This study
also points out that there is a high degree of competition between
chelant types.  A new class of materials, polyelectrolytes, are
also starting to be used in place of the traditional chelants.  In
the United States, Europe and Japan the banning of phosphates in
some areas for use in household detergents has caused an increase
in sales of other sequesterants/chelants.<P>

The markets for all of the chelants are well established and will
continue to grow, except that phosphate sales are declining.<P>

There have been a wide variety of clathrates discovered in research
laboratories worldwide over the past 50 years.  The purpose of this
study is to fathom out actual commercial use of clathrates, as well
as report research activity in this area.  There are 5 clathrates
used in commercial quantities--zeolites, cyclodextron, urea,
thiourea and crown ethers.  Markets for these are reported in this
study.<P>


<B>HISTORY OF THE MARKET</B><P>

The related subjects of sequestration/molecular complexing/chelation goes back to the origins of chemistry, when chemists inquired
if a compound was a true chemical compound or simply two compounds
joined by an electrostatic force.  These questions have not been
completely answered yet, and more research is being done, but most
of the answers have been obtained.  The whole purpose of chelation
is to immobilize unwanted chemicals, and the same thing is true of
clathration.  Thus, the two sciences are related, although the
mechanism of action is not the same.<P>


<B>SCOPE OF THE REPORT</B><P>

To quantify and qualify market data on chelates and clathrates for
the United States, with developments from Europe included, where

<B>REASONS FOR DOING THIS STUDY</B><P>

This technical/marketing study was prepared as an in-depth analysis to
forecast and track significant changes in detergent additive business and
technology.  The study describes the structure of the U.S. cleaning product
industry for both household, industrial, and institutional cleaners.  Sales
and composition of individual cleaner types are described.<P>

The consumption of cleaner additives is also described in this report and is
correlated with the cleaner type.  Thus the report has double value -- sales
of both formulated cleaners and detergent additives are discussed in the same
report.  This comprehensive report has value to sellers of cleaners and to
suppliers to cleaning formulating companies.  The format of the report
provides a context to examine, on a microscale, consumption of additives by
type of cleaner.<P>

The report describes the markets for cleaner additives.  These include
detergent builders, enzymes, brighteners, bleaching agents, chelates,
suspending agents, and diluents.  Surfactants used in individual cleaning
products are described.<P>


<CENTER><B>HISTORY OF THE MARKET</CENTER></B><P>

<B>FORMULATED CLEANERS</B><P>

Starting with soap, the original cleaning compound, the types of cleaning
products offered for sale have increased into the thousands.  Cleaners are
formulated to clean all types of substances -- metal, ceramics, wood, fabric,
and plastic -- in all types of environments -- home, factories, and
institutions.  They are designed to remove all types of stains and dirt --
food, rust, dust, and oil -- both by hand and by machine. This has led to the
need for cleaners with many different properties.  To name a few, variables to
be considered in the development of the formulation are alkalinity or acidity,
temperature of cleaning, expected water hardness, type of washing machine, and
cost of ingredients.<P>

These considerations have led to the development of hundreds of ingredients
available for the formulation of cleaners.  The cleaning formulation business
long ago became a partnership between chemical manufacturers and the
formulators.  The chemical companies would develop the additives.  There are
many steps in the development of an additive.  First, a manufacturing method
must be devised to make the product. Then, in order to sell the additive to
the cleaner companies, application data are needed.  Originally, suggested
formulas to utilize the ingredient and test methods for measuring efficacy
were sufficient.  Now toxicity data, biodegradability, and fish toxicity are
needed, in addition to cleaning performance data.  The price of ingredient is
also becoming more and more important.<P>

The formulator, armed with information on ingredient utilization, will adopt the
product only when environmental and cost/performance criteria have been met.<P>

At this time, introduction of new molecular moieties into the cleaner industry
has dropped to almost zero due to the very large testing costs.  Now the
formulators use the ingredients already available to formulate their products.
Due to the availability of literally thousands of approved ingredients, there
is still plenty of latitude to develop a detergent product to meet a need.<P>

Of course, packaging and advertising, in addition to cleaning performance, has
always played an important part in selling cleaners.  This is particularly
true in household cleaners.  Also important to formulators is recognizing a
new need for a cleaner, and then developing a cleaner to meet the need.  The
cleaner business has had a good track record in this.  The industry is one of
the leaders in product innovation. Introduction of liquid hand soaps, fabric
softeners, aerosols, automatic dishwash detergents, brushless spray-applied
car washes, and all-in-one laundry combination detergent/bleach are examples
of products to meet particular needs not previously recognized.  There will be
more of these.<P>

Of recent concern to household cleaning formulators is a lessening of brand
loyalty by customers to all consumer products, and buying primarily on price.
This had led to intense price competition and has coerced the large "soapers"
to alter merchandising procedures, such as reducing temporary price promotion
to supermarkets and reducing large-scale distribution of coupons.  The savings
from reduction of these promotions is applied to reduction of product price.
Other moves to save costs are the selling of concentrated cleaning products
that result in lowered packaging and transportation costs.<P>

In the I + I market the cleaning is done by employees and labor-saving
cleaning procedures have top priority.  Development of machines to quickly and
efficiently clean with the aid of cleaning compounds is important in all I + I
segments --janitorial, dishwashing, metal treating, laundry, sanitizing, and
vehicle washing.<P>


<B>CLEANING INGREDIENTS</B><P>

The turning point in detergent formulation came in the mid-1940's with the development of synthetic detergent-phosphate combination laundry products, led
by the Monsanto Co.  After this, no longer was laundry soap which left
harsh residues on clothes the laundry cleaner of choice.  Other important
milestones were the development of fabric softeners, detergent enzymes,
optical brighteners, dry chlorinated bleaches which supplied a solid form of
chlorine, suspending agents to prevent soil redisposition on clothing during
washing, and last but not least, the development of numerous synthetic
surfactants that met many requirements.  There are foaming and non-foaming
surfactants; ones that will remove particulate soils; ones that will remove
oily soils; and non-ionic, ionic amphoteric, and cationic detergents suitable
for formulating alkaline, neutral, and acidic detergents.<P>

<B>SCOPE OF THE REPORT</B><P>

This report (1) quantifies and qualifies technical and marketing data on
household and I + I cleaners and (2) quantifies and qualifies technical and
marketing data on additives to cleaners.<P>



<B>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

This study is divided into certain key chapters dealing with the market for
household and I + I cleaners by type of cleaner, and a separate section
describing the use of 13 important detergent additives in cleaner compounds.
Emphasis is given to areas currently under research, and future trends.  Focus
is on the United States and environmental concerns.<P>

<B>VALUE OF THIS REPORT</B><P>

This comprehensive technical/marketing study will be valuable to technical
personnel, those in research and development, as well as marketing and
business managers and executives in the areas of detergents formulation and
marketing (both household and I + I).  Technical and marketing personnel in
chemical companies that sell products for cleaning applications, Government
agencies, and legislative groups will also find value in this report.<P>

<B>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

The information sources used in compiling this report included an on-line
search, an NTIS search, and a search of patent literature, journals and
magazines, and producers' literature available.<P>

<B>STUDY GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

Applications of electrosynthesis in a variety of specialty organic and 
inorganic chemicals, chlor-alkali, and specialty products continue to show 
significant growth potential. Despite certain drawbacks in the area of chlor-
alkali chemicals, and certain risks associated with predicting specific use 
for the methods, and specific growth among developing chemical requirements, 
the use of these methods can be projected to experience significant change and 
growth over the next 5-10 years.<P>  

Although electrochemical methods have been used to produce more than two 
hundred chemical compounds, gases and metals, except for several notable 
exceptions, electrochemical methods are not employed as widely as might be 
expected.  This study shows that electrochemical methods have often been 
ignored or sidestepped when considering potential synthetic routes, ignoring 
potentially significant benefits and often failing to recognize unique 
opportunities at cost reduction for reagents, improvements in environmental 
impact, and improved product characteristics.  

For firms with the proper experience, insight, and people mix, there is 
significant upside growth potential.<P> 


<b>REASONS FOR DOING THIS STUDY</B><P>

The present state for the use of electrochemical technology for synthesis has 
the potential for relatively rapid change.  There are important areas for 
growth in the use of the technology, and there are areas of some significant 
turmoil for marketing concerns, difficulty in evaluating technology, and lack 
of experience.  Because of the changes in the industry and the potential 
upside for use of electrosynthetic methods, a technology/marketing report 
update is needed.<P> 

This technology/marketing report emphasizes areas where electrochemical 
methodologies are presently used, and those areas where electrochemical 
methodologies should be considered for the first time or reconsidered.  This 
report puts emphasis on the growth areas of specialty organic chemicals and 
pharmaceuticals and inorganic chemicals, and the area of the associated 
instrumentation for electrosynthesis.  The traditional electrosynthetic 
stronghold of the chlor-alkali industry is reviewed and its troubled growth is 
forecast.  No evaluation is provided for electrorefined metals or other 
electrochemically generated gases, because of what are considered overall poor 
business opportunities.<P> 

This report describes the market growth, the developing technology trends, 
industry leaders, and industry needs.  This report is a complete description 
and review of the complex electrochemical industry.  To our knowledge, this 
study is unique in bringing essential features of developing technology 
together with present markets into a coherent evaluation of the entire 
electrochemical synthesis industry.<P> 


<b>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY AND FOR WHOM</B><P>

This report will be valuable to those involved in chemical synthesis in 
industry, to those involved in supplying instrumentation to the 
electrochemical industries, and to those evaluating competing technologies.  
Further it may provide valuable insight in experiences in "selling" the 
approach internally within an organization, to help to support and overcome 
internal opposition to unfamiliar technology with examples of success and 
failures.  The report should prove useful to those engineering firms which 
look into new business opportunities which may be amenable to electrosynthetic 
methodologies.  Producers and suppliers of competing production processes are 
provided with a valuable outline of what electrosynthesis can, and cannot, do.  
BCC and the analysts wish to thank those companies, agencies, and university 
researchers who have made information available and provided verbal 
information for this report.<P> 

<b>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

This report includes a section which covers some of the background material on 
electrosynthesis.  Specific areas of electrosynthesis are then divided into 
four general areas:<P>  

<UL><LI> Specialty organic chemicals, including polymers and pharmaceuticals<P> 

<LI> Inorganic chemicals other than chlor-alkali chemicals<P> 

<LI> Chlor-alkali chemicals; and<P>

<LI> Electrosynthesis equipment<P></UL> 

Evaluations of the mature, conventional technology electrorefined metals and
electrogenerated gases industries are specifically not included in this report.<P> 

The area of electrochemical synthesis is large and is a diverse business with 
many aspects which are clearly not interrelated except for the fact that 
electrochemical methodologies are used to make a reaction proceed. 
Conversations with experts the general area of electrosynthesis indicate that 
electrosynthesis deserves renewed interest and consideration.  While several 
firms in Europe have extensive histories in using and developing 
electrosynthetic methods for commercial projects, the enthusiasm among 
electrochemists has not been converted into extensive use in industry in North 
America, with a few notable exceptions.  And in fact, in some cases, there has 
been some movement away from electrosynthetic methods.<P>  

This study is aimed at assessing as completely and as fairly as possible the 
present and potential areas where electrochemical synthesis methods and 
equipment markets are used.  Information for this report was collected by 
extensive industry contact with people long active in the use of 
electrochemical methodologies for synthesis, by review of the technical 
literature, patent literature, computer-retrieved information, and the 
author's experience with electrosynthetic methods, especially in the area of 
organic synthesis.  Key portions of patents are abstracted and cited as 
appropriate to demonstrate trends and versatility.<P> 

This comprehensive technical/marketing report provides forecasts for 
electrochemically generated chemicals and the associated equipment market for 
the near-term (to 1998), and defines the key technical and industrial 
developments and changes in market activities and attitudes.  This document is 
intended to be as accurate in technical, economic, and business areas as 
possible.  The quoted technical data are dependent on the accuracy of the 
manufacturers.  This report is not intended to constitute a legal document, a 
specific business plan for any product, or an endorsement of any given product 
or process.<P>

Neither the author, nor BCC Inc., as the publisher, assumes any 
liability for loss or damage as a result of reliance on this material.  The 
author and project manager wish to thank all of the manufacturers, engineering 
companies, end-users, marketers, professors, chemists and engineers who have 
demonstrated such a high degree of cooperation.<P> 

This report is a publication of BCC Inc.  BCC also produces a number of 
industry newsletters and a variety of market and technology surveys.  Users of 
this marketing and technology report may find newsletters entitled "Separation 
Technology News" and "Battery and Electric Vehicle News," produced by BCC Inc. 
particularly significant in updating specific market and technology areas 
related to this study. Among other things these newsletters offer information 
related to membranes used in electrochemical synthesis and to the use of 
electrolytic manganese dioxide and other electrochemically synthesized 
materials in batteries.  The BCC Inc. study entitled "Advanced Batteries, GB-
086N" also should prove useful in understanding the interplay between the 
electrosynthesized material and the battery application.<P>

</CENTER>

This  report presents the findings of a survey of the market
for specialty adhesives.<P>


<B>STUDY GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

This  report is intended to bring to the reader  a  detailed
analysis  of  the  market  for  specialty  adhesives,   with
emphasis   on   future  trends,  changing  technology,   and
opportunities.<P>

The major objectives of this study are as follows:<P>

      -     To  make  available  the  most  current  and
      reliable   information  on  the   consumption   of
      specialty adhesives<P>
      -     To  forecast the market for these  products,
      broken down insofar as possible by end use and  by
      individual product or product group<P>
      -      To   identify  the  most  rapidly  changing
      applications and the reasons for their  growth  or
      decline<P>
      -    To describe the major trends in the end uses<P>
      -      To   provide  a  description  of  the  most
      important companies supplying adhesives.<P>



<B>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P>

There  have  been  many analyses of the overall  market  for
adhesives, but relatively few of specialty adhesives,  which
represent a market with distinctive characteristics.<P>



<B>SCOPE</B><P>

For  the  purposes of this report, specialty  adhesives  are
defined  as  relatively  low-volume,  high-priced  products,
often  specially  formulated to meet  special  requirements.
The  report  specifically  excludes commodity-type  products
such as the following:<P>

<UL>
            <LI>-  Phenolics and their derivatives
            <LI>-  Urea-formaldehyde resins and related products
            <LI>-  All natural adhesives
            <LI>-  Rubber cement
            <LI>-  Polyvinyl chloride and copolymers
            <LI>-  Polyvinyl acetate and copolymers
            <LI>-  Acrylics
</UL>

The  study is also limited to the merchant market  only  and
does not attempt to measure the captive market.<P>


<B>METHODOLOGY AND SOURCES OF INFORMATION</B><P>

Information  on  market  size, growth  rates,  technological
trends,   and   regulatory  influences  was  obtained   from
interviews  with key marketing personnel with  suppliers  of
adhesives.   Secondary sources include published  government
data  and  reviews  of trade journals  such  as  Chemical  &
Engineering  News,  Chemical  Marketing  Reporter,  Chemical
Week, and Adhesive Age.<P>






<B>DOLLAR SALES VALUE</B><P>

All sales estimates are at the manufacturer's level, not  at
the retail or distributors' level.<P>

All  forecasts  are given in constant 1995 dollars.   Growth
rates are compounded annually.<P>


<B>TRADE NAMES</B><P>

Trade names are shown in upper case letters.<P>

PROJECT ANALYST<P>

<H3><I>INTRODUCTION</I></H3>
</CENTER>

<B>REPORT OBJECTIVES AND GOALS</B>

<P>The objectives of this report are twofold:</P>

 <P>a) To delineate the surface disinfectant industry in terms of
    products, suppliers, sales, and markets for the benefit of those
    unfamiliar with the industry or of those looking for a simple
    strategic overview;</P>

 <P>b) To provide significant value addition for those already in the
    surface disinfectant industry by assessing major issues shaping
    the industry's future and by making an independent,
    quantitative forecast.</P>

<P>The goals are to provide valuable data, analysis and insights of the highest caliber for business planning. </P>

<B>REASONS FOR STUDY AND ITS CONTRIBUTIO</B>

<P>Disinfectants have important roles in the control of infectious diseases, 
microbial food spoilage, and unwanted microbes generally. Today,
antimicrobial effectiveness and antimicrobial spectrum are no longer the sole 
criteria for judging surface disinfectants, and suppliers who ignore the new 
factors will be left behind.</P>

<P>Most analyses on sanitation and disinfection rely only on readily available data from the Census Bureau.  Most published studies do not segregate disinfectants from ordinary cleaners.  Most studies mix surface disinfectants with other types of antimicrobials.</P> 

<P>The industry itself often blurs the distinction between surface disinfectants and other types of products, partly due to misconceptions and partly due to the difficulty in making a proper distinction.  One of the contributions of this particular study is its use of a strict, microbiological definition of disinfectants and thus a restrictive analysis of the relevant product sales.</P>
  
<P>Thus, this study goes beyond the readily available data.</P>

<B>AUDIENCE FOR REPORT</B>

<P>This study is intended to serve the interests of senior executive management. Suppliers of formulated disinfectants, suppliers of bulk disinfecting chemicals, and others who are concerned about the quality of microbe control in the United States will find this report of value.</P> 

<B>STUDY'S SCOPE AND CONTENT</B>

<P>This study covers disinfectants for the surface treatment of inanimate 
objects. Included are disinfectants based on halogen compounds, quaternary 
amines, oxygen compounds, terpenes, and miscellaneous others.  We include 
sanitizers, janitorials, hospital disinfectants and cold sterilants.  We cover the consumer and the I&I markets and we cover the food, health, building maintenance and other sectors.</P> 

<P>Excluded from this study is any discussion or quantitation of antiseptics for skin, germicides for water treatment, antimicrobial preservatives, 
agricultural fungicides, and therapeutic antibiotics.  The virtue of this 
study is precisely its coverage of surface disinfectants without the confusion of mixing them with other antimicrobics.</P> 


<B>STUDY'S METHODOLOGY AND INFORMATION SOURCES</B>

<P>This study is based on scientific literature about germicidal chemicals, 
company product literature, business literature on disinfectants, Commerce 
Department Census Bureau data on cleaners and sanitizers, and telephone 
interviews with individuals in companies in positions of sales, product 
management, and market management.  We independently analyzed available data 
and information, in order to focus specifically on surface disinfectants.</P> 

<P>Brand names are indicated in capital letters and, wherever possible, we 
indicate the disinfecting active agents.</P> 
  
<P>Average annual growth rates (AAGR) are derived by the compounding method using standard tables of present value.</P> 

<P>Our analyses, observations and assessments are made independently, without the bias of vested interests.  Mentions of products are not endorsements, and 
omissions, if any, are not intentional.</P> 


<B>PERSONNEL FOR STUDY</B>

<P>The writer is an experienced microbiologist with an additional formal 
background in chemistry.  His experience is mainly in industry rather than 
academia, and therefore he provides an emphasis on product sales and business 
growth.</P> 

<P>Besides the formal education in the sciences, the writer also has an MBA 
degree in marketing.  He is the writer of a related BCC report on microbial 
sterilization (heat, EtO, radiation, UV, filter sterilization), BCC's study on medical anti-infectives, and many other published studies in the medical, 
biotechnological, and chemical areas.</P>

<B>STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

The goal of this study is to provide an understanding of the synthetic
functional fluids and lubricants (synlubes) industry.  To do this, we must
focus on several objectives. These are to:<P>

<UL> <LI>  Clarify the structure of this specialty industry<P>
<LI>   Highlight forces causing changes in the synlube industry<P>
   <LI> Ascertain the importance of governmental regulations<P>
<LI>   Estimate products and applications markets for synlubes<P>
 <LI>  Assess synlube marketing strategy and tactics<P>
<LI>   Describe synlube manufacturing and applications technology<P>
<LI>   Evaluate the global significance of the synlube industry, and<P>
<LI>   Profile synlube manufacturers and users.</UL><P>


<B>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P>

Significant changes are occurring in major applications areas for synthetic
functional fluids and lubricants.  These changes are significantly altering
product acceptance criteria, which means:<P>

<LI>   Synlubes will be required in many applications which were
formerly satisfied  by petroleum oils, and<P>

<LI>   Higher-performance, more-expensive synlubes will be favored in many important
   applications.<P>

This report will detail these changes and assess their relative importance, thus
providing vital guidance to the host of participants in the synlube industry
who must deal with these trends.<P>


<B>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY AND FOR WHOM</B><P>

This study will enable:<P>

<LI>   Directors of Planning to appreciate the strategic significance of synlube
   operations and develop plans that are appropriate to the situation,
   to either augment, acquire, or divest these business segments,<P>

<LI>   Directors of Development to select candidates for potential joint ventures,
   mergers, or acquisitions,<P>

<LI>   Directors of Marketing to develop successful marketing strategies
  and tactics,
   Directors of Sales to organize sales territories and set the criteria
   for selecting
   synlube sales representatives,<P>

<LI>   Directors of Research & Development to select worthwhile targets for R&D
   projects,<P>
<LI>
   Directors of Engineering to become familiar with the broad spectrum
   of available synlubes and their applications, and<P>

<LI>   Directors of Purchasing to know all of the potential suppliers of
    synlube products.<P>


<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

This study covers only synthetic functional fluids, hydraulic fluids and
lubricants, including:<P>

<UL> -  Organic esters, including vegetable oils<BR>
  - Synthetic hydrocarbons, including polyalphaolefins and polybutenes<BR>
 -  Phosphate esters<BR>
 -  Silicones and silicates<BR>
  - Polyalkylene glycols, and<BR>
  - Fluoropolymers and other specialized materials.</UL><P>

Both fully- and partially-synthetic functional fluids and lubricants are
covered in this report.  Consumption and projected demand quantities stated
include the mineral oil present in the partially-synthetic products as well as
minor quantities found in the fully-synthetic products.<P>

The study does not cover functional fluids and lubricants that are based on:<P>

<UL> -  Ordinary refined petroleum oil fractions<BR>
  - Super-refined petroleum oils<BR>
  - Oil-in-water or water-in-oil emulsions of petroleum oils<BR>
  - High-water-base hydraulic fluids and<BR>
  - Conventional transport-vehicle brake fluids and water-glycol hydraulic<BR>
  - Fluids, except the thickener portion of these formulations which
   is included with other polyalkylene glycols.</UL><P>

<B>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

To gain cogent, correct, and current information for this study, our first
step was to obtain and read appropriate scientific and trade literature as
well as relevant product literature from synthetic functional fluids and
lubricants producers.  Next, we interviewed by telephone selected authors of
synlube articles, marketing or product managers for these materials, and
applications engineers.<P>

At that point, we organized the information we obtained from these sources,
formed preliminary conclusions, and verified our understanding of the details
of the synlubes industry with a  representative group of the marketing or
product managers and applications engineers previously contacted.<P>

<B>GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

Using supercritical fluids to perform separations is a relatively
new technology with a large potential for growth.  Behind the
recent expansion in use are environmental concerns, such as the
need to eliminate organic solvents and the push to find
alternatives for incineration.  Another factor in its growing
popularity is the increase in demand for lowfat, low cholesterol
food products.  For these reasons, market opportunities are
improving in analytical laboratories and the food processing
industry.<P>  

The report provides an analysis of the supercritical fluid
industry.  Market forecasts will be provided for supercritical
fluid extraction, supercritical fluid chromatography, and
supercritical water oxidation.  The report will provide process
descriptions; discuss both commercial and developmental
applications; describe the major players in academia, government,
and industry; and suggest where research and development is headed.<P>

<b>PURPOSE OF THIS REPORT</B><P>

This report will provide the reader with insight into the direction
of the supercritical fluid industry.  From this report, the reader
should be equipped to identify business opportunities, be familiar
with the major players, and be knowledgeable about the improvements
in this aspect of separation science.<P>

This BCC study is intended for those who wish to review the state-
of-the-art in this area of separations technology.  The report is
for those who desire to learn the new and developing applications
and those who are interested in exploring opportunities for
commercialization.  The report will be of value to manufacturers,
companies interested in entering or expanding their involvement in
the supercritical fluid industry, and companies or laboratories
considering employing the processes for their own applications.<P>  

<b>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

In addition to providing the technologies and their markets,
companies, government agencies, and universities involved in
supercritical fluid extraction, chromatography, or water oxidation
are described.  Certain company profiles feature specific product
information.<P>  

In the case of supercritical fluid extraction, the services of
companies who have developed and commercialized specific processes
that rely on the technology, such as precision parts cleaning and
microcellular foams, will be highlighted.<P>  

Values of the market in this report are for the year given,
represent sales by companies in the marketplace, and are for the
United States only.  Projections are in terms of real dollars and
represent real growth.  Competition from other processes plays a
role in the success or failure of these novel techniques.  The
values are generally based on the best estimates of those involved
in the commercialization of the techniques.<P>  

<b>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

Research for this report began with an in-depth analysis of
technical and business literature, as well as a review of the
history of the technology.  Interviews with industry experts,
company representatives, federal government researchers, and
university scientists provided the basis for an assessment of the
outlook for supercritical fluids.<P>

This report is of a professional nature and has every intent at
accuracy.  It is not to be considered an endorsement of any product
described.  Nor is it intended to constitute a legal or accounting
document.  Neither the author nor the publisher assumes any

<B>STUDY GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>
 
Most market studies of marine-derived biomaterials have been conducted as 
segments of much larger studies of subjects such as aquaculture, commercial 
opportunities from the oceans, hydrocolloids, gums, thickeners, water soluble 
polymers, biotechnology, etc.  Such studies, while useful, have taken a "broad 
brush" approach and have not provided in-depth analysis of the large, 
important and growing marine biopolymer and marine biotechnology sectors.  It 
is the intention of this report to address this shortcoming by focusing on 
each of these important and growing industries.  In Part 1, we provide a 
detailed analysis of the important commercial, marine-derived, biopolymers and 
in Part 2, we provide an in-depth analysis of products derived from marine 
biotechnology which have, or someday will have, significant commercial 
potential.<P>  

Other than the marine biopolymers, surprisingly few commercially significant 
biomaterials have been derived from marine sources.  This dearth of 
commercially successful marine materials is especially unusual when we 
consider that the oceans, which cover nearly three quarters of the earth's 
surface, are home to an incredible multitude of biologically diverse life 
forms.  Science has identified close to 200,000 species of marine algae, 
animal bacteria, fungi and viruses.  It is thought that as many as four times 
this number have yet to be identified.  The marine environment under which 
these organisms live and propagate has endowed them with genetic and 
biochemical properties which are quite distinctive when compared to their 
terrestrial counterparts.  We have scarcely begun to explore this huge 
Thus, this report endeavors to give the reader an accurate bearing on the 
overall reservoir of biodiversity,  the commercial and scientific value of 
which is potentially enormous. commercial potential which exists in our marine 
environment.  The primary objectives are:<P>

<b>REASONS FOR THIS STUDY</B><P>


<b>Marine Biopolymers</B><P>

Among marine biopolymer producers, cost containment, modernized or new 
facilities and improved quality control measures have led to productivity 
gains and quality improvements across much of the industry; however, in all 
products but agarose, excess capacity has prevented the industry from seeing 
such efficiencies settle to the bottom line as improved profitability.  
Overcapacity is a vexing problem for the industry and only time and restraint 
on the part of producers and prospective producers will correct it.  

The participants in this industry need to be acutely aware of these 
developments to intelligently plan for the future.  This report brings these 
factors into focus and provides manufacturers, distributors, users, and raw 
material suppliers with the knowledge needed to make informed decisions 
relating to investment, procurement or material selection.<P> 


<b>Products of Marine Biotechnology</B><P>

Extensive work has been undertaken in recent years to investigate the largely 
untapped source of useful chemical substances present in the marine 
environment. The breadth of the work underway is vast as are the numbers of 
actual and potential commercial products.  By thoroughly researching 
literature, patent and other secondary sources and through discussions with 
major organizations, research institutions and universities, we have compiled 
an up-to-date listing and description of marine biomaterials that are either 
currently on the market or exhibit a clear potential for commercial 
development.  From this analysis we have made projections of volume and value, 
and have identified companies and organizations currently working on specific 
marine biochemical products or product categories.<P>

This compilation and 
description will provide a valuable service to those wishing to capitalize on 
the extensive research and development work that has been conducted in this 
area.  The pharmaceutical, biotechnology and research communities in 
particular will benefit greatly from this up-to-date compilation and 
appraisal.<P> 


<b>CONTRIBUTIONS OF THIS STUDY AND FOR WHOM</B><P>

This report is intended to provide up-to-date international market information 
concerning the production, distribution, regulation, use and competitive 
environment surrounding the marine biopolymers agar, agarose, carrageenan, 
alginate and chitin/chitosan.  It is further intended to inform those 
companies and organizations interested in obtaining a current assessment of 
the status and potential of novel products from marine biotechnology.<P>  

This report is an analysis and summation of interviews with hundreds of key 
industry officials, trade association representatives, consultants, users, and 
governmental personnel, as well as searches of patent and literature sources.<P> 

<b>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

The scope of this report is worldwide.  In the biopolymer sector, North 
America, Europe, Japan and the "rest of the world" are analyzed and reported 
upon separately. Because of its emerging status, we break out products of 
marine biotechnology into two categories, North America and the "rest of the 
world."<P>    

With a changing world order and the emergence of major economic powers in the 
Far East, we believe it is important to make a brief statement about the 
geographic areas used in our analysis of marine biopolymer volume and value.  
In prior studies on the subject, the delineation of Western Europe has been 
straightforward.  With the coming apart of the Soviet Union the situation is 
not nearly so clear.  Germany, for example, has essentially doubled in 
population with the incorporation of the former East Germany.  This change 
obviously must be considered when assessing the use and growth projections for 
marine biopolymers in Western Europe.<P>   

Many of the former East European countries, Poland, Hungary and Slovakia for 
example, are beginning to move out of their third world status.  In fact, the 
other former East Block countries represent a huge population and industrial 
base which is a growing consumer of certain marine biopolymers, most notably 
agar and alginates. Also, Russia, The Ukraine, Georgia and the other now 
autonomous states of the former Soviet Union must ultimately be considered as  
geographically significant markets in studies such as this.  Quite frankly, 
the situation is too muddy and the data too difficult to uncover for us to 
take on this challenge.  Thus, we have included usage of marine biopolymers by 
all states of the former Soviet Union under the "rest of the world" heading 
for purposes of this report.<P> 

Similarly, while we consider Japan to be an identifiable and quantifiable 
geographic market for this study, the huge and technologically sophisticated 
geographic market of the Western Pacific Rim is also considered to fall under 
the "rest of the world" category, as are Africa, South America, the countries 
of the Middle East and the Indian subcontinent.<P>  


Interestingly, in spite of their size,  these regions do not as yet contribute 
significantly to the consumption of marine biopolymers.<P> 

The report begins with an introductory chapter which is followed by separate 
sections covering Parts 1 and 2.  Each part includes a summary chapter 
followed by Industry Overview, Regulatory Issues, Shipment Trends, 
Technological Issues, International Issues, Industry Structure and Profiles of 
Key Manufacturers.<P>  


<b>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

The extensive research capabilities of the BCC staff were accessed to analyze 
markets, consumption trends and supply and demand.  New technologies, market 
developments and present and future trends were identified through patent and 
literature searches and discussions with key industry sources.  Current 
regulatory and environmental issues were ascertained through discussion with 
industry sources, relevant regulatory agencies and literature searches.  
Manufacturing methods, process economics, international trade statistics and 
major influences on the industry were derived from discussions with a wide 
range of industry and government sources.<P> 


<b>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

The substance of this report is based on interviews with principal 
participants in the industry.  Over 200 sources were contacted, including raw 
material suppliers, manufacturers of marine colloids and biomaterials, agents 
and distributors, consumers, and governmental agencies.<P>

This report presents the findings of an analysis of the U.S. market for
polysaccharides.<P>

<B>STUDY GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

This report is intended to bring to the reader a detailed analysis of 
industrial and consumer applications of polysaccharides, with emphasis on 
future trends, changing technology, and opportunities.<P> 

The major objectives of this study are as follows:<P>
<UL>     -  To make available the most current and reliable information on
        consumption of polysaccharides.<P>
     -  To forecast the market for these applications, broken down
        insofar as possible by end use and by individual product or
        product group.<P>
     -  To identify the most rapidly changing applications and the reasons for
        their growth or decline.<P>
     -  To describe the major trends in the end uses.<P>
     -  To provide a description of the most important companies
        supplying polysaccharides.<P></UL>

<b>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P>

Although there have been previous studies of polysaccharides, most have 
focused on specific products or markets.  Few have attempted to cover the 
entire field, to show the broad scope of their end uses and the variety of 
their structures.  Since these products represent a renewable source of raw 
materials, they should have an interesting future.<P> 


<b>SCOPE</B><P>

This report will cover all important polysaccharides and their major 
derivatives. However, it will not include plastics made from cellulose esters.<P> 

<b>METHODOLOGY AND SOURCES OF INFORMATION</B><P>
Information on market size, growth rates, technological trends, and regulatory
influences was obtained from interviews with key marketing personnel with 
suppliers of polysaccharides.  Selected end users were also interviewed.

<B>STUDY GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

Catalysts and the products made with them are all around us, even though most people neither
know what a 
catalyst is or what they do. Some experts claim that catalysts are involved in the manufacture of
products that 
represent about one-quarter of the entire U.S. GNP.  Considering that a high percentage of
chemical products are 
made via catalytic reactions (some experts put the percentage at 90% or higher), this percentage
seems logical.<P> 

Virtually every polymer, whether it be a synthetic fiber, plastic resin, or elastomer, is made with a
catalytic 
process. Other chemicals, from pharmaceuticals to pesticides, are produced catalytically. And
there is an entire 
body of catalysis, outside the scope of this report, in environmental correction; the most obvious
examples are 
catalytic converters on automobiles which clean up auto exhausts. Even our bodies are operated
by catalysts, the 
biological catalysts called enzymes, another important area of biocatalysis which is outside our
scope as well. <P>

Catalysts have been used commercially for more than 100 years, dating from the Deacon and
contact processes, 
first used in the late 1800s. Fritz Haber's ammonia synthesis of 1908 can be considered the
process which 
heralded the birth of modern industrial catalysis.  The  industry has grown to the point where
some catalyst 
markets are mature, most continue to grow at moderate rates, and some, most notably the
metallocene 
polymerization catalysts, are now seen as a major growth area.<P>

Our goal in this report is to describe the compounds, products, and markets for catalysts which
we describe as 
"petrochemical".  That is, catalysts which are used in petroleum refining; petrochemical processes
in which the 
feedstocks come from crude oil or natural gas; and chemical reactions/processes in which the
feedstock materials 
may come from other sources.  This is big business; the petrochemical industry in the U.S., driven
by production 
of synthetic polymers, is one of the nation's largest.<P>

Catalysis is highly technical and its products and markets are large and diverse. The industries and
applications 
which we cover are discussed below in "Scope".<P>



<B>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P>

Catalysts are important materials of commerce, even if most people do not realize how catalysts
touch them 
every day.  Most of us drive cars fueled with high octane non-leaded, often oxygenated or
reformulated, gasoline 
which is all blended with components produced in catalytic oil refinery processes.  We use plastic
products 
everywhere, and most likely the pharmaceutical products we use have been made with at least one
step a 
catalytic reaction.  Most of the food we eat has been grown on land fertilized with an
ammonia-based fertilizer; 
until the catalytic Haber ammonia process was developed there was no way to "fix" nitrogen from
the air to make 
it available for incorporation into chemical products.<P>

Some other applications of catalysts and catalytic reactions are not as well known to the average
person, but are 
no less important, since they affect manufacture of a vast number of chemical and other products
in other 
important commercial and consumer businesses and markets.<P>

BCC performed this study to provide a comprehensive reference for those interested and/or
involved in these 
products; this covers a wide and varied group of petroleum, petrochemical, chemical and other
companies which 
make and supply catalysts, chemicals, process technology, and equipment. Other interested parties
will be 
designers and marketers, politicians of all stripes, and the general public. We have sorted through
and condensed 
information from a large amount of literature and other reference materials to compile this
report.<P>


<B>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY AND FOR WHOM</B><P>

This report is intended to assist those involved in several different segments of the U.S. industrial
and 
commercial business sectors. These organizations and people include those who are involved in
the 
development, formulation, manufacture, sale, and use of catalysts, catalytic processes, and
ancillary busineses 
such as catalyst supports, additives, and regeneration. These include process and product
development experts, 
process and product designers, purchasing agents, construction and operating personnel, market
staff, and top 
management. BCC feels that this report will be of great value to technical and business personnel
in the 
following areas, among others:<P>

  Marketing and management personnel in companies which produce, market, and sell
petrochemical (that 
is, chemical and petroleum refining) catalysts.<P>
 
  Companies involved in the design and construction of process plants which use catalysts.<P>
 
  Financial institutions which supply money for these facilities.<P>
 
  Personnel in end-user companies and industries, such as chemical processing, packaging, and
consumer 
and household products.<P>
 
  Personnel in government at many levels, primarily at the federal level but also state and local
environmental 
and other regulators who must implement and enforce the laws regarding water and air quality,
etc.<P>




<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

This study covers many of the most important technological, economic, political, and
environmental 
considerations in the U.S. catalyst industry.  It is primarily a study of U.S. markets but, because of
the global 
nature of chemistry, it touches on some noteworthy international activities; these are primarily
those which can 
have an impact on the U.S. market such as imports/exports and foreign firms which operate
here.<P>  

All market value forecasts are given in constant 1995 dollars and growth rates are all
compounded. Market 
values are all rounded to the nearest million dollars. Because of rounding, some growth rates may
not agree 
exactly with figures in the market tables.<P> 

This report is segmented into ten sections, of which this is the first.<P> 

Section II, Summary, encapsulates our findings and conclusions, and includes the summary major
market tables.<P>
  
It is the place where the busy executive can find the major findings of the study in summary
format.<P>

Section III is an overview to catalysis and catalysts, with some history of the principal types of
catalysts and 
catalytic reactions, and processes and materials used to produce catalysts.  Its intent is to
introduce the reader to 
the field of chemical catalysis.<P>

Section IV discusses and forecasts markets for catalysts used in chemical processes; that is,
processes which 
usually do not take place in a petroleum refinery. We subdivide the market into catalysts for six
large classes of 
catalytic chemical reactions: hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, organic synthesis, oxidation,
polymerization, and 
synthesis gas/syngas processes.  Our market analysis and forecast are for base year 1995 and
forecast year 2000, 
all in constant 1995 dollars.<P>

Section V discusses and forecasts the markets for catalysts used in petroleum refining.  Processes
analyzed and 
forecasted include the six basic classes of catalytic refining processes: alkylation, fluid catalytic
cracking (FCC), 
hydrocracking, hydrotreating/desulfurization, isomerization, and catalytic reforming; in addition,
we cover gas 
processing.<P>

Section VI is devoted to catalyst technologies, with major emphasis on new catalyst technologies. 
These are 
exciting times in catalysts, for example there are new metallocene catalysts for polymerization of
major plastics, 
chiral catalysts for fine chemical syntheses, and others.<P>

Section VII covers some important facets of government regulation and public policy.  Catalysts
are not as 
regulated as many other industries, but political forces have driven the petroleum refining industry
for years, and 
continue to this day.<P>

Section VIII covers the structure of the catalyst industry, with emphasis on the major domestic
producers and 
suppliers, customer service, and the growing trend in supplier-user alliances. We also discuss and
forecast the 
growing business in recovery of spent catalysts.  We briefly discuss some international aspects of
the catalyst 
business, including the global nature of the business, major foreign-owned supplier companies
which operate in 
the United States, and imports and exports. Finally, we present estimates of merchant supplier
market shares for 
some major types of catalysts.<P>

Section IX consists of profiles of those companies which BCC considers to be the most important
in these 
businesses. There are many more companies which operate in one or more niche markets but
which, in our 
opinion, are not important enough to be considered major producers and suppliers.<P>

Section X is a glossary of some important terms, abbreviations, acronyms, etc., used in the
chemical, petroleum, 
and catalyst industries.<P>

The scope of this study is restricted to catalysts used in the chemical process industries (CPI) in
process 
operations. We define the CPI broadly to include petroleum refining (an industry sometimes called
the 
hydrocarbon processing industry or HPI).  By confining our study to process catalysts, we do not
cover a major 
market, large enough to deserve a study of its own, of environmental catalysts, primarily for air
pollution control. 
Because such environmental catalysts are chemical catalysts, we do introduce them and their
applications in the 
overview section, Section III; however, we do not make market forecasts for environmental
catalysts, since they 
are outside the scope of this study.<P>

Since this study focuses on chemical catalysts, we exclude biocatalysts (such as enzymes),
electrocatalysts, 
photocatalysts (catalysts that allow light or other waves in the electromagnetic spectrum to
influence reactions 
and processes), and other exotic ideas such as sonocatalysts (high frequency untrasound waves
that generate heat 
and pressure).  These are all exciting fields of study, but are outside the scope of this report.<P>

Please note that there are some new and exciting areas of catalysis, discussed in the Overview
(Section III) or 
Technology (Section VI), which are either (1) outside the scope of this study (e.g., environmental
catalysts) or (2) 
new, cutting edge technologies like chiral catalysis, whose markets at this time are too small or
new to forecast.  
The products and markets which we analyze and for which we forecast sales are those in Sections
IV and V on 
commercial catalysts for chemical and refinery processes.  As noted, we also forecast catalyst
recovery and assign 
some important supplier market shares in Section VIII.<P>

For consistency in style and format, tradenames are indicated by UPPER CASE letters, while
generic names in 
uncapitalized.  Because many chemical names are long and complicated, we often use
abbreviations, acronyms, 
or chemical formulae. Many of these, such as HDPE and PVC for common polymers, are in
capital letters but 
are not tradenames; we often use the word "brand" after a tradename to show that it is such.  The
common 
acronyms are so well known that there is little chance for confusion with brand name
products.<P> 

Chemical elements and compounds can all be designated by chemical symbols and formulae; after
introducing 
the element or compound we often use such symbols, such as Ni for nickel and HF for
hydrofluoric acid.  Section 
X, our glossary, contains definitions and explanations for many of the most important
abbreviations and 
acronyms.<P>


<B>METHODOLOGY AND INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

Searches were made of the literature, including many of the leading trade publications, as well as
technical 
compendia and government publications. Product and market information was obtained whenever
possible from 
the companies involved. The information for our corporate profiles was obtained primarily from
the companies, 
especially the larger publicly owned firms.  Other sources included directories and articles.<P>

<B>STUDY GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

This technical/marketing study was prepared as an analysis
to forecast and trace the significant changes in the
pesticide and agricultural chemical business, as well as
document the emerging trend toward integrated and low-input
agriculture.  Changes in the concepts of hard and soft
pesticides are coming about as new "biorational" control
measures become available.  This report identifies these
expanding technological innovations and evaluates the impact
of governmental regulations and legislative actions.  It
then projects what these developments mean for
manufacturers, suppliers and users of pesticides and crop
protection chemicals in terms of alternative agriculture.<P>


<B>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P>

Rapid changes are coming about in the conventional crop
protection business as well as in what chemicals are allowed
for use.  This study identifies the emergence of biocontrol
products against a framework of alternative agriculture and
integrated pest management concepts.  This
technical/marketing report examines the viable alternatives
to traditional hard (chemical) pesticides in the form of
biologically based, or soft, pesticides.  These are
presumably safer to the environment and less likely to cause
resistance in pest populations.  Pesticides, by type,
include fungicides, insecticides and herbicides.  These
compounds have continued to come under close government
scrutiny and public attack.<P>

The crop protection chemical business remains a market
sector that the world cannot adequately live without, and,
on the other hand, one that the world is very uncomfortable
living with. While a boon to farmers and the world's food
supply, many chemical-based pesticides persist in the
environment long after they have served their purpose.
These toxic chemical residues may show up in the food we
eat, the air we breathe and the water we drink, posing
serious health threats.  Increasing public awareness of
these dangers has prompted stricter government curbs on the
chemcial pesticides in both the U.S. and abroad.  Many
insect and weed populations have developed resistance to
chemical pesticides after years of use.  Still, effective
pest control is crucial to maintaining our food supply and
the financial stability of the agricultural market.<P>


<B>SCOPE OF REPORT</B><P>

This technical/marketing report will quantify and qualify
the market information for biorational pesticides for the
United States.  Included are specific market sectors such as
botanicals, pheromones, insect growth regulators, microbials
and genetically engineered products.  This report identifies
the state-of-the-art and market value for biological
pesticides in the U.S. and examines how this is impacting
agriculture in terms of low-input sustainable agriculture
and integrated pest management.  This is put into context by
looking at the total value of the U.S. pesticide market
including both the chemical pesticides and the newer concept
soft pesticides.<P>




<B>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

The information for this study is drawn from interviews with
individuals in the companies involved with bringing the new
biological pesticides to the marketplace, literature
searches, the patent literature and government files and
records for the more traditional crop protection chemicals.
Historical figures are for the year given.  In so far as
possible, projections are based on reasonable price
assumptions for the use of the products.<P>


<B>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY</B><P>

Once it is realized that agricultural pests and diseases are
not going to just go away, then there can be some ordered
program for coming to grips with the problem without
environmental or economic hysteria.  The crop protection
business continues to change because pests themselves elicit
different responses that must be made.  As there is a
general decline in the use and profitability of the chemical
pesticides, there is a rise in the new and more profitable
technology associated with biological controls.  New markets
are opening up in more effective control of agricultural
pests.<P>

This comprehensive technical/marketing study will be
valuable to technical personnel, those in research and
development, as well as marketing and business managers in
the areas of crop protection chemicals.<P>

The implications of the revolution in stereochemistry may be
more profound than biotechnology.<P>

A  hidden  but  surging  new industry  is  transforming  the
chemical,   pharmaceutical,  and  biotechnology  industries.
Chiral,  cis/trans, regiospecific, syn/anti and other  forms
of  stereochemical  isomerism will  have  enormous  economic
impact.<P>

Chemists  have long known that an organic molecule can  vary
in  special arrangements. And they have long been aware that
these isomers of the same chemical can vary significantly in
biological activity and chemical activity. But now they have
learned to synthesize pure forms of isomers. This technology
has  now  become  one  of  the  hottest  areas  of  chemical
research.  Key patents are flowing from the labs;  sales  of
new  products  are growing in excess of 10% a year  and  are
rapidly approaching the billion dollar mark.<P>

Analysts  are  not  just making blue  sky  predictions.  The
promise  of  stereochemistry is very real-and  it  is  being
realized.    More   effective  drugs,   higher   specificity
pesticides, purer colors and dyes, and advanced flavors  and
aromas    are    already   being   produced.   Biochemicals,
petrochemicals,  surfactants,  liquid  crystals,  and   even
polymers  are  benefiting. Suppliers,  from  instrument  and
intermediate  producers to manufacturers and  developers  of
separation technologies, are also poised for profits.<P>

<H3><I>INTRODUCTION</I></H3>
</CENTER>

<B>STUDY GOALS AND OBJECTIVES</B>

<P>BCC's goal in conducting this study was to determine the current
status of the  market for automatic identification systems and
assess their growth potential  over a six year period from 1994 to
2000.  We were particularly interested in  the types of technology
and kinds of applications being used by leading  industries to
identify products and people.<P> 

Our major objective was to present a comprehensive analysis of the
current  automatic ID industry and project its future course.</P>  

<B>REASONS FOR DOING THIS STUDY</B>

<P>Since BCC's 1988 study of this market entitled "Automatic
Product/People  Identification: Systems, Hardware," improvments in
technology have been made.   A variety of new and improved
products has been introduced and the industry  has expanded beyond
the identification and data collection stage.  At the same  time,
pressures for increased productivity and cost-efficiency have
heightened  the demand for more complete systems.</P> 

<P>BCC decided to examine the current position of automatic ID
systems  used in  key industries.  We were interested in what
technologies were being used to  meet the demands for
competitiveness.</P> 


<B>CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE STUDY AND FOR WHOM</B>

<P>We assembled a study of the seven leading types of automatic ID
technologies  used.  For each technology, we discuss its
operation, examine the  applications, discuss its advantages,
weigh the competitive aspects, identify  factors that will drive
demand, and assess the potential for growth.  We then  project
sales and revenue for all seven technologies by type and by
industry.   This study will be of interest to those in the
business of making automatic  identification equipment and media,
general manufacturers, retailers,  transportation equipment
makers, the medical industry, government  administrators, and
those in financial services.  It will also be of interest  to
computer makers, software companies and system integrators.</P> 


<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B>

<P>The scope of this study encompasses bar coding, biometrics,
magnetic striped  and smart cards, radio frequency, optical
character recognition, machine  vision, and voice recognition.  We
define these various automatic  identification technologies and
explain how they work.  The applications are  described and
quantified for each industry segment.  The limitations and 
proposed solutions for each automatic ID technology are discussed.</P> 

<P>We analyze the competitiveness of each technology in relation to 
standardization, economic considerations, and the potential for
application  expansion.  The advantages of each technology are
also explored.  Growth  factors for each industry segment are
identified and their impact on the  future is discussed.  Sales of
each type of Automatic ID technology are  estimated and also
allocated by industry segment.  The value of these sales is  also
projected.  The impact of software is presented and its relative
cost is  analyzed. Technological issues and trends are reviewed
and other influential  factors such as the economic climate are
discussed.</P> 

<P>BCC also presents an industry overview, profiles of major
Automatic ID  manufacturers and industry associations, an appendix
of vendors by technology,  and a glossary of terms.</P>      
  

<B>METHODOLOGY</B>

<P>BCC presents an analysis of the unit sales and their value by type
of  Automatic ID technology.  Our estimated value is what
customers have paid in  current dollars.  Then, based on our
surveys, we analyze the market factors by  technology and industry
segment, calculate estimates for growth, and forecast sales for
1994 and 2000.</P>   


<B>INFORMATION SOURCES</B>

<P>BCC surveyed approximately 100 companies to obtain the data for
this report.   Included were manufacturers of Automatic ID
equipment, software vendors,  computer manufacturers, and
companies in various industries who use the  technology. 
Additional data for this report were obtained from government 
information, trade associations, industry and financial sources,
and an  exhaustive review of technical papers.</P>

<H3><I>ADDENDUM INTRODUCTION</I></H3>
</CENTER>

Rather than rewriting the entire report entitled "Wireless
Communications" issued just over twenty months ago, BCC has chosen
to update that report with this addendum.  The sections of the
original report that deal with background, technology, applications
and economics have had little or no change in the intervening
months.  Therefore, this addendum will deal mainly with the
forecasts and outlook for wireless communications, updating and/or
replacing the original, and commenting on the factors that have
changed since the original forecasts were produced.<P>

Since this is an addendum of change, the original report in its
entirety remains valid, and is the basis for all comment in this
latest update.  In particular, the driving forces, issues, and
generally optimistic growth outlook as expressed in conclusions
noted in the Summary of the original report remain valid.  What has
changed is that wireless is seen as even more pervasive now than
just two years ago, even with our optimistic (and realistic taken
in hindsight) forecasts of acceptance.  This addendum is organized
with the same sub-headings within the Forecast and Outlook section

<H3><I>INTRODUCTION</I></H3>
</CENTER>

<B>STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

There has been a boom in business use of telecommunications for the
last two decades that is beginning to foster lower equipment and
services costs that will allow many of the uses to find a niche in the
residential market. Our goal in this report is to show how the
declining prices for all elements are fostering a new market for
telecommunications--the home.<P>

We hope to provide the reader with some of the background, technology,
and services development that will foster "The Coming Retail
Communications Explosion." We provide a comprehensive assessment of
all factors of market development, including both equipment and
services.<P>

<B>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P>

We believe there are certain trends underway that will blur the
distinction between residential and business telecommunications that
has existed for many years. Sales of cellular services, facsimile
units, personal computers, and similar new technology, have made
marketeers realize that the home of tomorrow may well be an extension
of the office of today. It is our outlook that telecommunications will
play a vital role in blurring the line between residential (what we
choose to call retail) and business use of new technology.<P>

Businesses have had the advantage in recent years of (l) the breakup
of the Bell System as we knew it in 1984; (2) the subsequent rise of
competitive carriers in the long-distance market; and (3) the rapid
implementation of microelectronic technology in all forms of computing
and communications applications. As a result, volumes for all forms
of technology and service have risen, with a related drop in pricing.<P>

This technology and pricing trend must have some spillover for the
non-business sector, which we choose to call retail. We chose five
application areas out of many potential areas for analysis and study.
These five should provide the reader with sufficient trends and
forecasts to allow related projections of similar telecommunications
applications for the retail sector.<P>

<B>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY AND FOR WHOM</B><P>

This report is intended to show how implementation of retail services
may evolve, especially for the five application areas studied. It
covers these five applications with a broad overview: noting issues,
technology, background, similar services, examples of today's users,
and l0-year projections of revenue for all parties -- equipment
suppliers, information providers, local and long-distance telephone
companies --with breakdowns of both units and sales dollars, where
applicable.<P>

It is intended as a planning tool for equipment manufacturers,
carriers, and information providers, and should be useful for
investors, analysts, regulatory bodies, and trade associations that
are involved in any way with the telecommunications industry.<P>

<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

The scope of this report is retail telecommunications in the United
States. There are examples of similar retail implementations springing
up around the world that support our outlook, although not covered.
The report covers in-depth analyses of (l) payphones, (2) electronic
directory services, (3) voice mail, or messaging as provided by
telephone companies, (4) 900 and 976-type services, and (5) home video
communications.<P>

The format includes a review of the background of telecommunications
growth that leads in some manner to either the implementation of
technology and/or the lowering of prices, a thorough discussion of
each application area, lO-year forecasts of all aspects of growth, and
some of the issues or drivers that may either deter or accelerate
growth. All dollar figures are in current United States dollars.<P>

<B>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

Our approach in determining the forecasts embodied in this report is
to assess the total potential market, recognize that evolution (not
revolution) is most appropriate for the retail or residential sector,
and to derive forecasts accordingly. We attempt as fine a breakdown
of related factors as is feasible, and also note many of the positive
and negative issues that confront such evolution. Our assumptions are
noted so that the analyst can change to other assumptions and alter
our forecasts, if appropriate.<P>

<B>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

BCC has compiled this report from interviews of industry executives,
current literature, attendance at seminars and tradeshows, and
interviews of industry executives. In addition, BCC has authored many
similar reports on the telecommunications industry, and has extensive
in-house expertise in all of the aspects of this report.<P>

<B>RELATED BCC WORK CREDENTIALS</B><P>

BCC has not previously focused on the retail sector of
telecommunications directly. We see this as a new and unique
contribution, as this market is in its infancy. Our prior reports on
Wireless Communications, Local Area Networks, and Private Networks
gave us some of the background presented in this report. BCC continues
to provide its customers with leading-edge information.</B><P>

<B>STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

VSATs (very small aperture terminals) are not an industry by
themselves--they tie-in and complement the satellite industry.
VSATs also do not just form two-way data networks, but come in
receive-only data and video versions. Many other reports have
treated this subject as an isolated phenomenon, apart from the
satellite industry, and as exclusively a two-way data event. In
this report we wish to show all the inter-relationships. Therefore,
we present a complete assessment of the satellite industry along
with a thorough review of all types and markets for VSATs.<P>

In so doing, we have compiled a comprehensive assessment of the
market factors for both satellites and VSATs, a review of
justification for all types of VSATs, a separation of the key
players from those that have limited capabilities, market sizings
in all aspects of both equipment and services, and one of the most
complete and up-to-date research of VSAT users ever presented.<P>

<B>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P>

We believe that VSATs are the predecessors of many new applications
afforded to users having direct links to satellites. Today, VSATs
are being increasingly used by governmental and commercial entities
to both save money over terrestrial alternatives and to accomplish
forms of communication not feasible on terrestrial transmission
facilities.<P>

We see a trend in VSAT equipment of decreasing prices; a trend
toward digitization of television signals; and a potential for
mobile and low-earth-orbit satellites -- all of which should assist
the satellite owners and operators to turn to one of the key
revenue producers they have for the future: VSATs.
In another respect, without VSATs satellite operators are facing at
best a slow growth industry, and more likely, a no growth industry.
We cover not only the VSAT outlook, but also the total satellite
industry outlook in this report.<P>

<B>CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE STUDY AND FOR WHOM</B><P>

The study of VSATs includes all technical aspects pertinent to the
market, a review of the satellite industry and an assessment of
capacity based on transponder usage, history of all -aspects of
VSATs, a full discussion of key players along with market share,
future and international trends, and realistic ten-year forecasts
of each segment of the VSAT market with installed networks by
customer name as a base.<P>

This report is primarily oriented to those directly involved with
the satellite industry, satellite operators, service providers, and
earth station suppliers. However, we have a complete listing of
VSAT users and a discussion of VSAT economics which should be of
interest to anyone considering the implementation of any type o f
a VSAT network. Our discussion of the impact of VSATs on the
terrestrial carriers should interest all carriers in understanding
the potential for lost revenue. All suppliers of electronic and
radio frequency components used in VSATs should find the realistic
market projections in this report helpful in their planning. Those
involved with installation and maintenance of VSATs will find in
this report a complete outlook of this segment of the business.<P>

Investors, regulators, market analysts, and trade associations
should find this report a comprehensive review of the topic and an
aid to their endeavors.<P>

<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

Our particular focus in this report is all three types of VSAT
networks--receive-only data, receive-only television, and two-way
data--for the United States. We also cover the international
market issues and potential in summary form.<P>

The format includes consistent forecasts of market-generated demand
for the years 1991 to 2001, along with a calculation of the
resulting average annual growth rate, called AAGR. All dollar
figures are shown as current (1991) United States dollars. We
include all of the assumptions behind our forecasts.<P>

<B>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

Our approach to determining the forecasts embodied in this report
is to assess the pricing trends, the total potential market, and
the vendors' and service providers' abilities to implement
networks, and to derive our numerical analysis accordingly. We do
not use any form of direct compound growth--rather our
calculation of AAGR is taken after our forecasts are complete. In
researching the information for this report, we were diligent to
uncover every installed VSAT network and the quantity of terminals
in each. This installed base formed the foundation for our
forecasts. In addition we not only discuss the potential for each
market segment, but also note the probable issues or risks that
might affect such an outlook negatively.<P>

<B>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

In accomplishing the research for this report we found useful
information in trade press articles, other reports, press releases,
vendor and supplier brochures, and related documents. In addition
we interviewed a key executive in many of the leading VSAT supplier
companies. Interviews of speakers and exhibitors at seminars and
trade shows were also used for sources.<P>

<B>RELATED BCC WORK CREDENTIALS</B><P>

Prior reports by BCC on Wireless Communications, Satellites, and
Private Networks were all used in some fashion to form the
background material for this report. The author's extensive
background in the satellite industry in general, and VSATs in
particular, were a key asset in pin-pointing key factors of the
VSAT market. BCC continues to publish strategic reoirts on all
sectors of the telecommunications markets.<P>

</CENTER>

<B>STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

The long distance market has undergone considerable change in the
last 10 years. It has matured to the point that three carriers
share over 95% of the net revenue. The long distance
business is poised for growth into the 21st century, and our goal
in this report is to assess both the total and the underlying
factors that will accelerate that growth. We also note issues that
may cause growth of particular areas, or carriers, to be different
from the total market.<P>

There is also a need for common language when addressing the many
different services and opportunities, and we include necessary
background and explanation of applications and services to
establish a basis for comparison.<P>

<B>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P>

The year 2001 has been somewhat an intriguing year, with many
futuristic scenarios of what not only telecommunications but the
entire environment will be in that year. We felt a comprehensive
study on a part of that environment--the long distance industry in
the United States--would add to our understanding of the future. We
also wished to take many of the future scenarios and assess them
with realistic analyses as to how do we get from here to there.<P>

<B>CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE STUDY AND FOR WHOM</B><P>

This report deals only with the long distance business, but
recognizes the many factors that affect that business, particularly
the emerging international services opportunities for the countries
on the European and Asian continents. In assessing applications
that will drive this market we include background of each
application along with requisite equipment, so that all aspects of
potential growth are covered.<P>

This report is complete in its approach to the potential of the
long distance market. It is written for both local and long
distance carriers, equipment suppliers, regulators, and analysts
that desire a comprehensive view of all the factors that will
influence the long distance market.<P>

<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

Our emphasis in this report is the United States long distance
market, recognizing that (1) international service is a significant
growth area for domestic carriers, and (2) local telephone
companies provide the gateway to long distance service.<P>

The report includes consistent forecasts of market-generated demand
for the years 1991 to 2001, along with the resulting calculation of
average annual growth rate, AAGR. All dollar figures are shown in
current United States dollars. We include all assumptions behind
our forecasts.<P>

<B>METHODLOGY</B><P>

Our approach to determining the forecasts embodied in this report
is to assess the pricing trends, past history, and potential
drivers and issues, along with availability and price of requisite
equipment, in order to derive our numerical analysis. We do not use
any form of direct compound growth--rather our calculation of AAGR
is taken after the forecasts are complete. In researching the
information for this report we used reported information where
available and our estimates where necessary. We break down the
total market into service segments, showing forecasts, issues, and
drivers for each.<P>

<B>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

In accomplishing the research for this report we found useful
information in trade press articles, annual reports, FCC reports
and filings, vendor and supplier literature, and related documents.
In addition, we interviewed key executives in the industry,
attended seminars, discussed applications at trade shows, and used
our background in this industry to assure completeness.<P>

<B>RELATED BCC WORK CREDENTIALS</B><P>

Prior reports by this author for BCC on Satellites, VSATs, and
Private Networks were all used in some fashion to form the
background material for this report. The author's extensive
background in the long distance market was the key factor in
assessing the key issues and drivers for a comprehensive outlook.
BCC continues to publish strategic reports on all aspects of the
telecommunications market.<P>

<H3><I>INTRODUCTION</I></H3>
</CENTER>

<B>STUDY GOAL AND OBJECTIVES</B><P>

Recognizing that volumes of sales will drive down equipment costs for video
communications, and also recognizing that communications costs are coming down
dramatically, the area of video communications should flourish as the key
telecommunications application of the 1990s, and continue into the 21st century.<P>

Our objective is to give the reader both the background, market sizing,
pricing forecasts, and related factors to make a comprehensive assessment of
the future for video communications. We offer a 10-year outlook of this
subject, together with reviews of vendors, technology, and the background
related to video communications.<P>

<B>REASONS FOR DOING THE STUDY</B><P>

For some time analysts have referred to the five generations of computers--generations that spoke to the technology of computer components: tubes, integrated circuits, chips, large scale integration of circuits, and very
large scale integration. The favorite comparison is to note that a computer of
the 1960s can be contained on a single VSLI chip of today.<P>

This same evolution has spurred the development of video communications. The
"generations" of video communications can better be classified in their use,
although technology has played an important part in the cost and convenience
of use. This report is oriented more toward use, with the four generations of
video communications evolving from the (1) permanent room with controllable
audio/video systems, to the (2) rollabout or temporary cabinet for quick
upgrade of any room into a video communications setup, to the (3) desktop
personal computer where some of the processing and display are combined with
the computer, to the (4) standalone unit where the video is built-in with the
handset (this latter group is referenced in this report as "residential,"
although we see both desktop and standalone units being bought by either
commercial or residential customers).<P>

The first two generations have occurred and were designed primarily with the
business or national organization in mind, while the latter two are still
emerging and apply to residential customers, as well.<P>

In like manner, the world of communications is evolving. The analog carriage
of the past is being replaced with digital  transmission capabilities. This
report's forecast is based on the coincidence of digital transmission with
video compression in digital form. We cover the background of both, and note
that the years 1994 through 1996 will be key to video communications--years
in which all the video development will be mature, and in which a significant percentage of local carriers will convert to an ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network) interface.<P>

<B>CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY AND FOR WHOM</B><P>

We include all aspects of video communications--business television,
conference room systems, desktop systems, and standalone (residential) units--and offer separate discussions and forecasts for each. It is intended as a source of background and forecast for vendors of video compression devices and audio/video support systems, computer manufacturers, long distance carriers, local telephone companies, and similar organizations involved with the future of video communications.<P>

<B>SCOPE AND FORMAT</B><P>

This report covers only the growth of video communications in the United
States, briefly noting the international impact. All figures are based on 1992 U.S. dollars.<P>

Following a comprehensive section on the background of both video transmission and telecommunications trends, the report addresses the four sections of the market individually: business television, conference room systems, desktop systems, and residential (standalone) units. Vendors, technology trends and user requirements, users and applications, and forecasts are discussed for each of these four groups.<P>

<B>METHODOLOGY</B><P>

We note all our assumptions in the discussion of forecasts. These assumptions include pricing, unit sales, installed inventories, and, where applicable, trends or dependencies on related factors, such as the conversion to digital by local telephone companies.<P>

<B>INFORMATION SOURCES</B><P>

BCC has compiled this report from research of available literature, interviews of leading industry experts and vendor representatives, attendance at seminars and tradeshows, and combined that input with the experience of the author, who has been personally involved with the video communications evolution.<P>

<B>OTHER BCC WORK CREDENTIALS</B><P>

Although this is the first BCC report on video communications, that subject has been covered as key to both satellite and long distance revenues, as discussed in the BCC reports: G-134, VSATs; G-109, ISDN; and G-136, Long Distance.<P>
