"How does the fluoride in toothpaste prevent cavities? Is there
any kind of 'natural' fluoride protection, or is it only in
artificial compounds?"
</A></B></FONT>

<P>--<I>Lori Veverka<BR>Twinsburg, Ohio</I>

<P>Francine Van Meter, junior clinic coordinator in the <A
HREF="http://www.cabrillo.cc.ca.us/CWIS/dental/dhhmpg1.html"TARGET="_top">dental
hygiene department</A> of Cabrillo College in Aptos, Calif.,
provided the following material:

<P>"Acids from plaque cause the loss of minerals from the tooth (a
process called demineralization), resulting in tooth decay. The
formation of small cavities, or carious lesions, can be reversed
by remineralization--that is, the deposition of minerals into
previously damaged areas of tooth. Topical fluoride, when
applied frequently in low concentrations, increases both the
rate of growth and the size of enamel crystals. The accelerated
growth of enamel crystals within the demineralized lesion
initiates reminerization of the tooth. Also, the larger crystals
are less prone to future attack from the acids.

<P>"Systemic fluoride--ingested fluoride that is absorbed mainly
through the stomach and intestine into the bloodstream--helps to
strengthen teeth while they are growing. The fluoride is carried
to developing tooth buds, where the interaction with the
developing crystals initiates the replacement of hydroxyapatite
(the tooth enamel's normal crystalline composition) with
fluorapatite (a related crystal which incorporates fluoride).
Fluorapatite is more resistant to decay than is hydroxyapatite."

<P>Mary Hayes of the <A HREF="http://www.ada.org/"TARGET="_top">American Dental
Association</A> presents some further information:

<P>"Fluoride is a naturally occurring element that prevents tooth
decay when ingested systemically or applied to teeth topically.
The fluoride ion comes from the element fluorine. Fluorine, the
13th most abundant element in the earth's crust, is never
encountered in its free state in nature. It exists only in
combination with other elements as a fluoride compound. It is
found in this form as a constituent of minerals in rocks and
soil everywhere. Water passes over rock formations containing
fluoride and dissolves these compounds, creating fluoride ions.
The result is that small amounts of soluble fluoride ions are
present in all water sources, including the oceans.

<P>"Fluoride is present to some extent in all foods and beverages,
but the concentrations vary widely. All water contains some
fluoride naturally. Water fluoridation is the process of
adjusting the fluoride content of  water to the recommended
level for optimal dental health. In the U.S., the optimum
concentration for fluoride in the water has been established in
the range of 0.7 to 1.2 parts per million (ppm). The specific
optimum for a locality is dependent on the average annual
temperature for the region.

<P>"Researchers believe there are several mechanisms by which
fluoride achieves its anticaries (cavity-preventing) effect. It
reduces the solubility of enamel in acid by converting
hydroxyapatite into less soluble fluorapatite; it may exert an
influence directly on dental plaque, reducing the ability of
plaque organisms to produce acid; and it promotes the
remineralization of tooth enamel in areas that have been
decalcified by acids.

<P>"Most likely, fluoride works by a combination of these effects.
But the remineralization effect of fluoride is of prime
importance, because it results in a reversal of the early caries
process and it gives rise to an enamel surface that is more
resistant to decay."

"How do rechargeable (that is, zinc-alkaline or nickel-cadmium) batteries work?<br>
What makes the reactions reversible in some batteries, but not in others?"
</A></B></FONT>

<P>--<I>Anne Fullerton<BR>Waterloo, Ontario, Canada</I>

<P><A HREF="http://www.chem.orst.edu/users/lernerm/lernerm.html"TARGET=_top">Michael M.
Lerner</A>, an associate professor of chemistry at Oregon State University,
responds:

<P>"One of the necessary conditions for a battery to be rechargeable is that the
underlying chemical changes that occur during an electrical discharge from the
cell must be efficiently reversed when an opposite electrical potential is
applied across the cell. In nickel-cadmium (NiCad) batteries, for example, the
Cd(OH)<SUB>2</SUB> and Ni(OH)<SUB>2</SUB> that are formed during cell discharge
are readily converted back to the original electrode materials (Cd and NiOOH),
when the cell is recharged.

<P>"In contrast, nonrechargeable, or primary, batteries can be based on irreversible
chemical changes. For example, the carbon-fluoride- lithium primary batteries
often used in cameras generate energy by converting (CF) n and Li metal to carbon
and LiF. But the starting material at the battery' s cathode, (CF)n, is
<I>not</I> reformed when a reverse potential is applied. Instead the cell
electrolyte decomposes, and eventually the fluoride is oxidized to form fluorine
gas.

<P>"A reversible chemical change is not the only requirement for rechargeable
batteries, however. To be classified as rechargeable, the battery must be able to
undergo the reverse reaction efficiently, so that hundreds or even thousands of
recharging cycles are possible. In addition, there must often be provisions to
ensure that the recharging process can occur safely.

<P>"The alkaline batteries (which are generally based on the conversion of
MnO<SUB>2</SUB> and Zn to Mn<SUB>3O<SUB>4</SUB></SUB> and ZnO) offer an excellent
example of this last point. Although the chemical changes at the electrodes can
be reversed, until recently alkaline batteries were manufactured only to function
as primary cells. Recharging one of these primary cells could allow the battery
to be reused, but the possible number of recharging cycles for such a cell is
very limited--it performs more poorly with each recharge. More important,
recharging an old-fashioned alkaline battery is not safe. During or after a
recharge, the battery might generate enough hydrogen gas to cause an explosion.
In their rechargeable form, alkaline cells have undergone several changes. They
have been redesigned to allow for a more efficient reverse reaction, they contain
a catalyst to minimize hydrogen formation and they have safety vents that prevent
the buildup of excess pressure during recharging."

<P><A HREF="http://eande.lbl.gov/BERC/frm.html"TARGET=_top">Frank McLarnon</A> is a staff
scientist and principal investigator in the Energy & Environment Division of
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. He clarifies why some reactions are
irreversible:

<P>"All batteries, both rechargeable and nonrechargeable, undergo electrochemical
reactions. When a battery is discharged, an electrochemical oxidation reaction
proceeds at the negative electrode, and an electrochemical reduction reaction
occurs at the positive electrode. When one attempts to recharge a battery by
reversing the direction of electric current flow, the opposite takes place: a
reduction reaction proceeds at the negative electrode, and an oxidation reaction
takes place at the positive electrode.

<P>"In the case of the rechargeable battery, the electrochemical oxidation-
reduction reactions are reversible at both electrodes. For example, when the
battery is recharged, the overall electrochemical reduction reaction at the
negative electrode is identical to the electrochemical oxidation reaction that
proceeded at the negative electrode when the battery was discharged, only written
in reverse.

<P>"In the case of the nonrechargeable battery, when one attempts to recharge the
battery by reversing the direction of electron current flow, at least one of the
electrochemical oxidation-reduction reactions is not reversible. When the battery
is charged, the overall reduction reaction that proceeds at the negative
electrode may not be the true reverse of the oxidation reaction that proceeded
when the battery was discharged. For example, metal oxidation might be the sole
oxidation reaction during battery discharge, whereas the formation of hydrogen (a
highly inflammable and therefore dangerous gas) might be a significant reduction
reaction during battery recharging.

<P>"An added requirement for a well-behaved (that is, long-lived) rechargeable
battery is that not only must the electrochemical oxidation- reduction reactions
be reversible, they must also return the electrode materials to their original
physical state. For example, rough or filamentary structures may form in the
battery after repeated charge- discharge cycles. These structures can result in
unwanted growth of the electrode and subsequent electronic contact between the
battery electrodes- -a short circuit.

<P>"Because of these requirements, the development of a well-behaved rechargeable
battery is significantly more difficult than the development of a nonrechargeable
battery. In the case of the nickel-cadmium battery, the cadmium electrode has two
important features. First, the rate of hydrogen formation on cadmium is very slow
(compared with that on pure zinc or pure iron, for example). Second, the
solubility of cadmium in basic aqueous electrolyte solutions is sufficiently low
that the cadmium does not tend to dissolve in the electrolyte and migrate to the
positive electrode or elsewhere within the battery. At the same time, however,
the cadmium is sufficiently soluble that its reduction can proceed easily, and it
can form compact cadmium structures during battery recharge; the solubilities of
most other metals are either too high or too low. These and other fundamental
factors have allowed the successful development of the rechargeable
nickel-cadmium battery."

"How far are we from realizing practical benefits from
nanotechnology?"</A></B></FONT>
 
<P>-<I>Mohan Kumar, Wigan, England</I>

<P>This question is a tricky one because "nanotechnology" is such a broad and
vague term. Four researchers wrote in to give their views regarding the
meaning of nanotechnology and when we will begin to benefit from it.
 
<P><A HREF="http://www-ee.stanford.edu/ee/faculty/plummer.html">James D.
Plummer</A>, professor of electrical engineering at Stanford University,
replies:

<P>"It is difficult to give a precise answer to this question because the
term 'nanotechnology' is not well defined. It means different things to
different people. Perhaps the broadest definition of a 'nanostructure' is
something which has a physical dimension smaller than 0.1 micron, or 100
nanometers (billionths of a meter). Using this definition, integrated
circuits will qualify as nanostructures shortly after the turn of the
century. Current integrated circuits have minimum dimensions on the order
of 0.35 microns. Based on current rates of development, people have
projected that around the year 2005 companies will be manufacturing in
high volume integrated circuits that have dimensions around 0.1 micron.
These numbers refer to the lateral dimensions that are used to define the
patterns in integrated circuits. 

<P>"Furthermore, the vertical dimensions in current integrated circuits are
already as small as five to 10 nanometers. (That is the rough dimension of
the gate insulator thickness in current MOS transistors, the most common
kind of transistor.) So if size alone defines nanotechnology, then
everyone of us is seeing practical benefits of it today.

<P>"When many people think of nanotechnology, however, they think of other,
more exotic kinds of devices: nanomachines or medical applications in
which tiny machines circulate in the bloodstream cleaning out fat deposits
from our arteries, for example. Such technologies are much further off,
probably 25 years at least. In those kinds of applications, the problem
often lies as much in defining a useful, appropriate application for
nanotechnology as it does in actually building the nanostructure."

<P><A HREF="http://Seemanlab4.Chem.NYU.edu">Nadrian C. Seeman</A> in the
department of chemistry at New York University offers another viewpoint:

<P>"This is a very broad question, containing at least two ambiguities. The
first lies in the meaning of 'nanotechnology.' To most people,
nanotechnology implies an intelligently directed association of chemical
components used to make objects and devices on the chemical scale, much as
we make them on the macroscopic scale. How does this procedure differ in
practice from ordinary chemistry? To my mind, not at all. Chemists try to
assemble molecules using a combination of theoretical principles and
practical experience to mold molecules that have desired structural and
chemical properties. This is also what nanotechnologists do.

<P>"The element of structure is key here. The structural goals of
nanotechnology are frequently more ambitious than making a single
molecule. Often nanotechnologists wish to make arrays of identical or
complexed molecules, sometimes on a scale that will transcend the
boundaries of the microscopic and approach the macroscopic. There are two
different approaches to this end, 'top-down' and 'bottom-up.' The top-down
approach is exemplified by scientists who build objects and molecular
arrays using the techniques of scanning probe microscopy. The bottom-up
approach is exemplified by investigators who design two- and
three-dimensional chemical systems that cohere according to the rules of
chemical interactions. The advantage of the top-down approach is its
exquisite precision, but its disadvantage is its lack of extensive
parallelism--it requires manipulating atoms and molecules practically one
by one. In contrast, the bottom-up approach is massively parallel.

<P>"There is already one highly successful nanotechnological system: we call
it life. All the goals of nanotechnology are already fulfilled in living
systems, and most of our attempts at nanotechnological applications can be
called biomimetic, either applying the structural principles of living
systems to different compounds or using the compounds of living systems
for different purposes. For example, in our laboratory at N.Y.U., we have
used analogs of branched DNA molecules (found in the process of genetic
recombination) to form stick polyhedra, a cube and a truncated octahedron,
whose edges consist of DNA double helices. The polyhedra are assembled
from branched molecules that hold together because of the same
sticky-ended hydrogen bonding that is used by the cell to direct
replication of the genetic code. As in our work, living systems tend to
make their structural components on the nanometer scale, rather than on
the angstrom scale where most chemists work.

<P>"The second ambiguity involves the term 'practical.' If there is any use,
to anyone, of any scientific advance, I regard it as practical, although
others might feel differently. A key near-term goal of our laboratory is
the assembly of stick polyhedra into periodic arrays, in order to attack
the key problem of macromolecular crystallography, the crystallization
problem. We hope to assemble our polyhedra by means of sticky-ended
cohesion so that they will diffract x-rays and so that crystallographers
can determine their structures and the structures of suitably oriented
molecular guests contained within the polyhedra; we expect to be able to
form these arrays within five years. It should then be possible to make
substantial advances in determining the structures of biological
molecules, an advance that will have potential biomedical impacts. To me,
this is a practical benefit."

<P><A HREF="http://www.chem.purdue.edu/faculty/kubiak/cpk.html">Clifford P.
Kubiak</A> and Jason I. Henderson in the department of chemistry at Purdue
University in West Lafayette, Ind., add this joint response:

<P>"How far we are from realizing practical benefits from nanotechnology
really depends on which aspect of nanotechnology is being considered. Some
nanotechnologists envision gears, camshafts and motors engineered on the
nanometer (billionth of a meter) scale. Others think of integrated
circuits whose smallest features are on the scale of tens of nanometers.
Still others see chemical 'self-assembly' as a means of building up larger
functional structures or devices from molecular building blocks 0.5 to
five nanometers in size. There is a common goal shared by all these
researchers, however: to make devices that are smaller than anything now
available. 

<P>"In general, there are two distinct approaches to constructing very small
things: (1) to etch, chisel or sculpt small features into an existing
structure or (2) to build up tiny structures from even smaller ones.
Research in nanotechnology can be classified according to which approach
is employed. People in the first group are using techniques such as
scanning tunneling microscopy, atomic-force microscopy, electron beam
lithography and other forms of lithography to define very small features,
down to the atomic scale (0.1 nanometer). Miniature gears, tiny sensors
and smaller integrated circuits are but a few of the objects being
fabricated via this approach. The other group is building up larger
structures by manipulation of molecular components, a process called
chemical self-assembly. Single-electron transistors, highly ordered arrays
of nanoscale metal or semiconductor clusters and microcontact stamps that
can transfer submicron-scale patterns are a few of the recent
breakthroughs resulting from the second approach. 

<P>"The question of how far in the future the real, practical benefits lie
has been considered in the most detail by the Semiconductor Industry
Association. The semiconductor industry has the largest business interest
in the tremendous improvements in computer processor speeds and
information storage densities that will result from nanoscale devices. The
smallest feature of an Intel Pentium processor is currently on the order
of 350 nanometers (0.35 micron). The industry's <A
HREF="http://www.sematech.org/public/roadmap/">'National Technology
Roadmap for Semiconductors'</A> sets a 70-nanometer minimum feature size
as a goal to be realized by the year 2010. The image of a roadmap provides
a nice conceptual model for nanotechnology research and development.
Proved, existing technologies are the high-volume superhighways. But the
next-generation technologies might be found on what are in 1996 only
unimproved roads, footpaths or unblazed trails! It is widely believed that
the 70-nanometer goal will not be achieved by incremental improvements of
present-day lithographic processes. 

<P>"Paradigm shifts may be necessary that totally revolutionize the most
fundamental architectures of logic and memory devices. A recent article in
<I>Scientific American</I> (<A HREF="../0796issue/0796gunshor.html">'Blue-Laser CD Technology,'</A> by
Robert L. Gunshor and Arto V. Nurmikko, July 1996) described blue-laser CD
technology. That technology would replace the existing
820-nanometer-wavelength laser technology with 460-nanometer-wavelength
blue lasers, greatly increasing the amount of data that could fit on a
compact disk. All nine of Beethoven's symphonies could be played from a
single audio CD, instead of just one symphony. Clearly, this technology is
analogous to a paved road, and it may soon see widespread application. A
radical paradigm shift to, say, single-electron transistors that take
advantage of nonlinear 'staircase' current-voltage responses (which are
only possible in nanostructured materials) may take many years to move
from being a vague footpath to something resembling a road.

<P>"We would like to thank professors Ronald Andres (Chemical Engineering),

"What is Jell-O? How does it turn from a liquid to a solid when it cools?"</A></B></FONT>

<P>-<I>Ellen Formanek, Lawrence, Kan.</I>


<P><A HREF="http://www.orst.edu/Dept/eco_edu/faculty/zah.html">ZoeAnn
Holmes</A> in the department of Nutrition and Food Management at Oregon
State University offers a short reply:<P>

"Jell-O, a brand name, is in general made by heating <A
HREF="http://palimpsest.stanford.edu/don/dt/dt1508.html">gelatin</A>
(processed collagen) in water. The large, stringlike protein molecules of
the gelatin wiggle around in the hot water solution. As the gelatin mixture
begins to cool, the protein strands have less and less energy to wiggle,
until eventually they eventually bond together. If everything happens
correctly, bonding occurs at points along the strands, forming pockets that
trap the surrounding liquid. When the process is done, the collagen forms a
three-dimensional structure or matrix, known as a semisolid colloidal gel.
It is this matrix that gives Jell-O its structural integrity.<P>

"Processed collagen is removed and purified from cattle hides, the same
substance that may make your shoes. The cattle hides are high in collagen
and a variety of other substances."<P>

David J. McClements, an assistant professor in the Biopolymers and Colloids
Research Laboratory at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, provides
this more extensive overview of dessert science:<P>

"The principal component responsible for the transition from a liquid to a
semisolid gel on cooling is gelatin. Gelatin is a protein derived from
collagen, the major component of the connective tissue of animals. Jell-O
and other, similar products consist of powdered gelatin mixed with
sweeteners, flavorings and coloring agents.<P>

"In its natural state, collagen exists as fibers that contain three
polypeptide chains entwined into a helical structure. Collagen is converted
to gelatin by heating it in the presence of water. This procedure breaks
down the relatively weak (noncovalent) bonds holding the three polypeptides
together, as well as some of the stronger, covalent bonds, and produces a
solution in which the polypeptides are arranged into a predominantly
amorphous structure.<P>

"When the solution of gelatin cools below a certain temperature, the
molecules tend to associate with one another in order to regain some of
their original helical structure. In this way, junction zones are formed.
The junction zones mark a local return of the original form: three
polypeptide chains in a helical formation. If there is enough gelatin
present, a gel will form. The gel consists of a three-dimensional network of
gelatin molecules linked by these junction zones, which is capable of
entraining large amounts of water through capillary forces. This gel has
solidlike characteristics, although it is really a viscoelastic material.<P>

"Gelatin is a thermoreversible, cold-setting polymer: if the gel is
reheated, it will convert back to a liquid because the forces favoring the
amorphous state (mainly configurational entropy) outweigh those favoring the
aggregated state (mainly hydrogen bonds). For this reason, gelatin cannot be
used in 'cook and serve' products such as puddings that are supposed to form
gels when heated. These products must incorporate a heat-setting polymer,
such as starch."<P>

For those interested in history, we add the following details: flavored
gelatin was invented by Peter Cooper, the founder of <A
HREF="http://www.cooper.edu/history.html">the Cooper Union for the
Advancement of Science and Art</A>, in collaboration with his wife, Sarah.
<A HREF="http://www.vacation.com/ipi/snb/img0018.htm">General Foods</A>
began marketing flavored gelatin under the trademarked Jell-O name in 1897.<P>

</A></B></FONT>

<P>--<I>Bill Endow <BR>New York, New York</I>

<P>We posted one response to this question a while back in <A
HREF="http://www.sciam.com/askexpert/computers.html#acs52"TARGET="_top">'Ask the Experts.'</A>
Since then, <A HREF="http://aa.Stanford.EDU:80/~holovis/"TARGET="_top">Lambertus Hesselink</A>
of Stanford University, one of the leaders in the field, has written in to offer
some additional information:<P>

"Holographic data storage is receiving a lot of attention lately, because there
is a strong need for large data storage systems having capacities exceeding
hundreds of gigabits and fast access times as well as fast data transfer rates.
Currently, only RAID systems (which incorporate two or more magnetic hard disks
for storage and backup) can achieve this performance, but only at a very high
cost, as many drives need to be connected together. Because the medium is not
removable, capacity can be increased only by adding more drives to the system.
Other systems also have serious drawbacks. Optical-disk 'jukeboxes' are clumsy
and mechanically unreliable. Tape drives do not afford efficient, random access
to the data. In the future, systems built around high-density digital videodisks
(DVDs) will have very large data capacities, but their access times and data
transfer rates are limited.<P>

"Holographic systems are attractive because they can store very large amounts of
data inside a volume of recording material. The surface data density in some of
these systems exceeds 100 bits per square micron, or 10 billion bits per square
centimeter. The primary components of such a system are a spatial-light modulator
(SLM), which formats the data to be stored into a 'page' of pixels; an array of
charge-coupled devices (CCDs), which 'read' the data stored in the hologram; and
the recording medium itself. A laser is used to record and to retrieve the data.<P>

"The sensitivity of the recording medium usually dictates the type of laser that
is required. Currently an yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser is the most commonly used
illumination source, but we would like to use a smaller, cheaper diode laser that
emits in the near infrared (at wavelengths just too long to be visible to the
eye). Unfortunately, most traditional ferroelectric recording materials are not
sensitive to those wavelengths. Recently, however, the government-industry
photorefractive information recording materials team (of which I am the principal
investigator) has made substantial progress in the development of materials that
are sensitive in the near infrared. Holographic images can be 'fixed' into these
materials using lower-power lasers than has been the case in the past. In
addition, new polymer materials are currently under development; these promise to
be cheap and very sensitive, which again allows the use of much lower-power
lasers.<P>

"These new components have been incorporated into promising holographic data
storage systems. After the first digital holographic data storage system was
built at Stanford University (see 'Volume Holographic Storage and Retrieval of
Digital Data,' by J. F. Heanue, M. C. Bashaw and L. Hesselink in <I>Science</I>,
Vol. 265, page 749; August 5, 1994), several groups around the world have built
similar systems. The storage capacity and data transfer rates of these devices
have improved significantly since then.<P>

"In summary, we have made a lot of progress in the past few years, but the
recording materials are still the key component limiting the overall performance
of holographic data storage systems. Much work is currently being carried out at
universities and industrial labs around the world. Based on the progress in those
labs, it is reasonable to expect that viable products could reach the market
around the turn of the century."<P>

"Computers are becoming faster and faster, but their speed is
still limited by the physical restrictions of an electron moving
through matter. What technologies are emerging to break through
this speed barrier?"</A></B></FONT>

<P>-<I>Alexander Lopez, North York, Ontario, Canada</I>

<P>David DiVincenzo at the <A HREF="http://www.watson.ibm.com/"
TARGET="_top">IBM
Thomas J. Watson Research Center</A> offers this response:

<P>"All current computer device technologies are indeed limited
by
the speed of electron motion. This limitation is rather
fundamental, because the fastest possible speed for information
transmission is of course the speed of light, and the speed of
an electron is already a substantial fraction of this. Where we
hope for future improvements is not so much in the speed of
computer devices as in the speed of computation. At first, these
may sound like the same thing, until you realize that the number
of computer device operations needed to perform a computation is
determined by something else--namely, an algorithm.

<P>"A very efficient algorithm can perform a computation much
more
quickly than can an inefficient algorithm, even if there is no
change in the computer hardware. So further improvement in
algorithms offers a possible route to continuing to make
computers faster; better exploitation of parallel operations,
pre-computation of parts of a problem, and other similar tricks
are all possible ways of increasing computing efficiency.

<P>"These ideas may sound like they have nothing to do with
'physical restrictions,' but in fact we have found that by
taking into account some of the quantum-mechanical properties of
future computer devices, we can devise new kinds of algorithms
that are much, much more efficient for certain computations. We
still know very little about the ultimate limitations of these
'quantum algorithms.' "

<P><A HREF="http://me.mit.edu/people/faculty/SethLloyd.html"
TARGET="_top">Seth
Lloyd</A>, an assistant professor in the mechanical engineering
department at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
prepared this overview:

<P>"The speed of computers is limited by how fast they can move
information from where it is now to where it has to go next and
by how fast that information can be processed once it gets
there. An electronic computer computes by moving electrons
around, so the physical restrictions of an electron moving
through matter determine how fast such computers can run. It is
important to realize, however, that information can move about a
computer much faster than the electrons themselves. Consider a
garden hose: When you turn on the faucet, how long does it take
for water to come out the other end? If the hose is empty, then
the amount of time is equal to the length of the hose divided by
the velocity at which water flows down the hose. If the hose is
full, then the amount of time it takes for water to emerge is
the length of the hose divided by the velocity at which an
impulse propagates down the hose, a velocity approximately equal
to the speed of sound in water.

<P>"The wires in an electronic computer are like full hoses:
they
are already packed with electrons. Signals pass down the wires
at the speed of light in metal, approximately half the speed of
light in vacuum. The transistorized switches that perform the
information processing in a conventional computer are like empty
hoses: when they switch, electrons have to move from one side of
the transistor to the other. The 'clock rate' of a computer is
then limited by the maximum length that signals have to travel
divided by the speed of light in the wires and by the size of
transistors divided by the speed of electrons in silicon. In
current computers, these numbers are on the order of trillionths
of a second, considerably shorter than the actual clock times of
billionths of a second. The computer can be made faster by the
simple expedient of decreasing its size. Better techniques for
miniaturization have been for many years, and still are, the
most important approach to speeding up computers.

<P>"In practice, electronic effects other than speed of light
and
speed of electrons are at least as important in limiting the
speed of conventional computers. Wires and transistors both
possess capacitance, or C--which measures their capacity to
store electrons--and resistance, R--which measures the extent to
which they resist the flow of current. The product of resistance
and capacitance, RC, gives the characteristic time scale over
which charge flows on and off a device. When the components of a
computer gets smaller, R goes up and C goes down, so that making
sure that every piece of a computer has the time to do what it
needs to do is a tricky balancing act. Technologies for
performing this balancing act without crashing are the focus of
much present research.

<P>"As noted above, one of the limits on how fast computers can
function is given by Einstein's principle that signals cannot
propagate faster than the speed of light. So to make computers
faster, their components must become smaller. At current rates
of miniaturization, the behavior of computer components will hit
the atomic scale in a few decades. At the atomic scale, the
speed at which information can be processed is limited by
Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. Recently researchers working
on 'quantum computers' have constructed simple logical devices
that store and process information on individual photons and
atoms. Atoms can be 'switched' from one electronic state to
another in about 10<SUP>15</SUP> second. Whether such devices
can be
strung together to make computers remains to be seen, however.

<P>"How fast can such computers eventually go? IBM Fellow Rolf
Landauer notes that extrapolating current technology to its
'ultimate' limits is a dangerous game: many proposed 'ultimate'
limits have already been passed. The best strategy for finding
the ultimate limits on computer speed is to wait and see what
happens."

<P>Robert A. Summers is a professor of electronic engineering
technology at <A HREF="http://www.weber.edu/"
TARGET="_top">Weber State
University</A> in Ogden, Utah. His answer focuses more closely
on the current state of computer technology:

<P>"Physical barriers tend to place a limit on how much faster
computer-processing engines can process data using conventional
technology. But manufacturers of integrated-circuit chips are
exploring some new, more innovative methods that hold a great
deal of promise.

<P>"One approach takes advantage of the steadily shrinking trace
size on microchips (that is, the size of the elements that can
be 'drawn' onto each chip). Smaller traces mean that as many as
300 million transistors can now be fabricated on a single
silicon chip. Increasing transistor densities allow for more and
more functions to be integrated onto a single chip. A
one-foot-length of wire produces approximately one nanosecond
(billionth of a second) of time delay. If the data need to
travel only several millimeters from one function on a chip to
another on the same chip, the data delay times can be reduced to
picoseconds (trillionths of a second). Higher-density chips also
allow data to be processed 64 bits at a time, as opposed to the
eight, 16 or, at best, 32-bit processors that are now available
in Pentium-type personal computers.

<P>"Other manufacturers are integrating several redundant, vital
processor circuits in parallel on the same chip. This procedure
allows several phases of data processing to happen at once,
again increasing the rate of data throughput. In another, very
different approach, manufacturers are working on integrating the
entire computer--including all memory, peripheral controls,
clocks and controllers--on the same centimeter-square piece of
silicon. This new 'superchip' would be a complete computer,
lacking only the human interface. Palm-size computers that are
more powerful than our best desktop machines will become
commonplace; we can also expect that prices will continue to
drop.

<P>"Another thing being looked at is software that will better
utilize the capabilities of present machines. A surprising
statistic is that some 90 percent of the time, the newest
desktop computers run in virtual 86 mode--that is, they are made
to run as if they were ancient 8086, eight-bit machines--despite
all their fancy high-speed, 32-bit buses and super color
graphics capability. This limitation occurs because most of the
commercial software is still written for the 8086 architecture.
Windows NT, Windows 95 and the like are the few attempts at
utilizing PCs as 32-bit, high-performance machines.

<P>"As for other technologies, most companies are very jealous
of
their security, and so it is difficult to know what new things
are really being looked at. Fiber-optics and light systems would
make computers more immune to noise, but light travels at
exactly the same speed as electromagnetic pulses on a wire.
There might be some benefit from capitalizing on phase
velocities to increase the speed of data transfer and
processing. Phase velocities can be much greater than the host
carrier wave. Utilizing this phenomenon would open an entirely
new technology that would employ very different devices and ways
of transporting and processing data."

<P>More information on the possible benefits of optical
computing
comes from <A HREF="http://www.coe.ttu.edu/ee/WALKUP.HTM"
TARGET="_top">John
F. Walkup</A>, the director of the Optical Systems Laboratory in
the department of electrical engineering at Texas Tech
University in Lubbock, Tex.:

<P>"Electronic computers are limited not only by the speed of
electrons in matter but also by the increasing density of
interconnections necessary to link the electronic gates on
microchips. For more than40 years, electrical engineers and
physicists have been working on the technologies of analog and
digital optical computing, in which the information is primarily
carried by photons rather than by electrons. Optical computing
could, in principle, result in much higher computer speeds. Much
progress has been achieved, and optical signal processors have
been successfully used for applications such as synthetic
aperture radars, optical pattern recognition, optical image
processing, fingerprint enhancement and optical spectrum
analyzers.

<P>"The early work in optical signal processing and computing
was
basically analog in nature. In the past two decades, however, a
lot of effort has been expended on the development of digital
optical processors. The major breakthroughs have been centered
around the development of devices such as VCSELS (Vertical
Cavity Surface-Emitting LaserS) for data input, SLMs (Spatial
Light Modulators, such as liquid-crystal and acousto-optic
devices) for putting information on the light beams, and
high-speed APDs (Avalanche Photo-Diodes), or so-called Smart
Pixel devices, for data output. Much work remains before digital
optical computers will be widely available commercially, but the
pace of research and development has increased in the 1990s.

<P>"One of the problems optical computers have faced is a lack
of
accuracy; for instance, these devices have practical limits of
eight to 11 bits of accuracy in basic operations. Recent
research has shown ways around this difficulty. Digital
partitioning algorithms, which can break matrix-vector products
into lower-accuracy subproducts, working in tandem with
error-correction codes, can substantially improve the accuracy
of optical computing operations.

<P>"Optical data storage devices will also be important in the
development of optical computers. Technologies currently under
investigation include advanced optical CD-ROMs as well as
Write/Read/Erase optical memory technologies. Holographic data
storage also offers a lot of promise for high-density optical
data storage in future optical computers or for other
applications, such as archival data storage.

<P>"Many problems in developing appropriate materials and
devices
must be overcome before digital optical computers will be in
widespread commercial use. In the near term, at least, optical
computers will most likely be hybrid optical/electronic systems
that use electronic circuits to preprocess input data for
computation and to postprocess output data for error correction
before outputting the results. The promise of all-optical
computing remains highly attractive, however, and the goal of
developing optical computers continues to be a worthy one."

"What is the state of development of 'solid state' data storage devices
(using holographic techniques, for instance)? How soon can we expect to see

<P>-<I>Bill Endow, New York City</I>

<P>Glenn T. Sincerbox, program manager for holographic storage systems and
technology at the <A HREF="http://www-i.almaden.ibm.com/almaden/">IBM
Almaden Research Center</A> in San Jose, Calif., passed along the following
information:

<P>"Since holographic data storage was first proposed and demonstrated in the
early 1960s, many efforts have sought to make the technology more capable
and affordable to computer users. We have made some dramatic progress
recently, but even so, the very first commercial products are at best still
three to five years away. And the wait will surely be longer for home PC
users, for whom low cost is an extremely important factor.

<P>"Holographic storage involves splitting a laser beam in two, placing a
'page' of data on one of the beams and then aiming the beams so that they
cross. Where the beams intersect, an interference pattern of light and dark
areas occurs. The beams are directed so that the interference pattern forms
within a special optical material that reacts to light and retains the pattern.
A thousand or more pages can be recorded within a single volume of material
by crossing the beams at different angles, a technique called angle
multiplexing. Additional volumes are created by aiming the beams at
different spots within the material. Shining a 'playback' laser beam through
the material (oriented at the same angle that was used for recording)
produces, almost magically, a second beam that re-creates a holographic
image of the original data page. That page can then be read by an array of photodetectors.

<P>"In the past few years, there has been considerable progress in developing
affordable devices that could be used to place data pages onto laser beams
and to detect the illuminated holograms. Unfortunately, the best of the
current holographic materials--nonlinear crystals--are very expensive and
have limited capabilities. I am one of the chief principal investigators for
two consortia recently funded by the Defense Department's Advanced Research
Projects Agency (ARPA), along with several companies and universities. One
consortium is looking for improved holographic materials; the other is
developing prototype systems for specialized applications. We still have not
found an all-around ideal material, although there are some promising
candidates. The consortium plans to complete its first write-once
data-storage demonstration platform in late 1997; a read/write (erasable)
version should follow a year or so later.

<P>"The greatest potential advantage of holographic data storage is its ability
to access vast amounts of data rapidly and to transfer it to the computer's
central processing unit in parallel at very high rates--billions of bits a
second. Such rapid retrieval of large data pages is particularly suited for
storing digital images, such as movies, medical images, maps, catalogues and
so on.

<P>"But especially in the early years of any commercial production, the general
public will probably find holographic data storage systems is too bulky and
expensive. Although the technology can store huge amounts of material in
very small volumes of material, the entire system of lasers, optics,
detectors and electronics will initially be rather large. Once the
technology is successfully established in one or more business niches,
additional technical and manufacturing development, along with economies of
scale, could help make holographic devices more affordable and compact. But
popular applications of this technology are at least several years away."

that is even more durable?"</A></B></FONT>

<P><A HREF="http://www.adlittle.com/news/jan0896.html">Stuart
Lipoff</A> is vice president and director of advanced

HREF="http://www.adlittle.com/">Arthur D. Little</A> and
president of the Consumer Electronics Society of the <A
HREF="http://www.ieee.org/">Institute of Electrical and
Electronics Engineers</A> (IEEE). He answers:

<P>"The lifetime of CD-ROMs is unknown, as the discs have not been
in existence long enough for us to study and understand the
mechanisms by which they wear out. Manufacturers are most likely
making conservative promises of how long the discs will last so
that the companies will not incur legal liability if some
unanticipated 'wear-out' mechanism shows up long into the
future.

<P>"It is often possible to predict the lifetime of a product (or a
key component of a product) by subjecting it to accelerated life
testing--that is, by increasing the stress on the component
until it fails. It is not clear, however, which stresses will
lead to failure, or if increasing the stress accurately predicts
what happens at the end of a component's life.

<P>"The disc of a CD-ROM is made of polycarbonate plastic and an
encapsulated thin, reflective layer of aluminum. The digital
information on the disc is imprinted in that aluminum layer.
There are a number of possible wear-out mechanisms that could
damage or destroy the information on a compact disc. Ultraviolet
light can alter the optical properties of the polycarbonate
plastic; cold flow of the plastic could lead to mechanical
distortion of the disc; and oxidation could impair the
readability of the aluminum reflective layer.

<P>"Practically speaking, the most likely wear-out mechanism for
CD-ROMs will be the changing technology of data storage. Long
before the disc itself becomes unreadable, it is likely that the
CD-ROM will be replaced by a new medium and that it will not be
possible to find a CD-ROM reader, except perhaps in a museum."

"A colleague of mine mentioned a recent advance in the creation of DNA-based
computers. What kind of computation can be done with strands of DNA?"</A></B></FONT><P>

<P>-<I>Dylan Walker, Westport, Conn.</I><P>

<A HREF="http://www.cs.rochester.edu/u/ogihara/home.html">Mitsunori
Ogihara</A>, an expert in computational complexity at the University of
Rochester, responds:<P>

"DNA computers have opened up an entirely new vista in computing. Instead of
silicon chips and electrical currents, DNA computers use deoxyribonucleic
acids--A (adenine), C (cytosine), G (guanine) and T (thymine)--as the memory
units, and recombinant DNA techniques carry out the fundamental operations.
In a DNA computer, computation takes place in test tubes. The input and
output are both strands of DNA, whose genetic sequences are considered to
encode certain information. A program on a DNA computer is executed as a
series of biochemical operations, which have the effect of synthesizing,
extracting, modifying and cloning the DNA strands.<P>

"Broadly speaking, the only fundamental difference between conventional
computers and DNA computers is the capacity of memory units: electronic
computers have two positions (on or off), whereas DNA has four (C, G, A or
T). So, in theory, DNA computers can compute whatever kinds of problems that
conventional computers can. But DNA computers also have some special merits.<P>


"First, DNA memory is compact. One cubic centimeter of DNA soup could store
as much as 10^21 bits of information, whereas, with the current technology,
conventional computers have a memory of at most 10^14 bits. Second, whereas
most electronic computers operate linearly--they manipulate one block of
data after another--biochemical reactions are highly in parallel: a single
step of biochemical operations can be set up so that it affects trillions of
DNA strands in the test tube.<P>

"These properties suggest that DNA computers might be useful for solving
some problems that have been traditionally regarded as intractable. DNA
computers are not without drawbacks, however; the biochemical operations
involved are subject to errors and are often slow. Rigorous tests of the
accuracy of the operations and further technological development are needed
in order to clarify the real potential of DNA computers."<P>

<A HREF="http://www.mssm.edu/physbio/local/primfac/bancroft.html">Carter
Bancroft</A>, a professor in the department of physiology and biophysics at
the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, offers some additional insights:<P>

"Workers in the field of DNA-based computation (of which I am one) hope
that, at least for some applications, DNA-based computers will be far more
powerful and efficient than silicon-based electronic computers. This hope is
based mainly on the following properties of DNA:<P>

"First, it is the major information storage molecule in living cells, and
billions of years of evolution have tested and refined both this wonderful
informational molecule and highly specific enzymes that can either duplicate
the information in DNA molecules or transmit this information to other DNA
molecules.<P>

"Second, each molecule of DNA is roughly equivalent to a little computer
chip. But DNA molecules are much smaller than computer chips, so you can get
lots of them into a little space--roughly 10 trillion of them would fit in a
space the size of a marble.<P>

"And third, all these molecules can work together at once, so you could
theoretically have 10 trillion calculations going on at the same time in
this little space (or the number of simultaneous operations could be far
greater still if your computer were a lot larger than a marble).<P>

"To answer the question about the kind of computations we can do now with
DNA: The field is still very new, and there are at present really only two
types of computation we know how to do. One comes from the work of <A
HREF="http://hto-e.usc.edu/people/Adleman.html">Leonard Adleman</A> of the
<A HREF="http://www-hto.usc.edu/">University of Southern California</A> and
involves solving combinatorial problems such as the famous <A
HREF="http://www.pcug.org.au/~dakin/tsp.htm">'Traveling Salesman
Problem'</A> (roughly defined, it is the task of finding the most efficient
way to visit a number of cities and get back to your starting point). The
other comes from our <A
HREF="http://science-mag.aaas.org/science/scripts/display/short/273/5272/220.html">recent
work</A> in which we showed how DNA can be employed to carry out a very fundamental
computer operation: addition of two numbers expressed in binary. We believe
these two types of computation represent just the tip of the iceberg of the
power of DNA as a computational molecule."<P>

control and also can learn how to deal with previously 
unencountered situations. Many groups are working on ways to 
improve this learning process. For instance, researchers at my 
university have devised a means of inserting knowledge directly
into 
the neural network, omitting the first 'training' phase,
resulting in 
so-called Expert Networks that not only learn from experience
but 
have the ability to explain how or why they reach a given
conclusion, 
in case a concerned human is back-seat driving.<P>

"And, yes, neural network computers can learn from each other. A

classic example of this was invented by researchers <A
HREF="http://envy.cs.umass.edu/People/barto/barto.html">A.G.
Barto</A> and <A
HREF="http://envy.cs.umass.edu/People/sutton/sutton.html">R.S.
Sutton</A> of the 
University of Massachusetts at Amherst, and by C.W. Anderson of
the 
University of Sheffield. They begin with two untrained
('knowledge-
free') neural nets, and the goal is for one net to learn to
balance a 
pole from its base, while the goal of the other is to learn to
be a pole 
anchored at its base. That is, the second neural net learns to
mimic 
the mechanical system itself, while the first learns to control
it. The 
two nets send signals back and forth, in effect, helping each
other to 
learn." <P>

<A HREF="http://www.cms.uncwil.edu/faculty/narayan.html">Sridhar
Narayan</A>, a researcher 
in the department of mathematical science at the University of
North 
Carolina, Wilmington, presents a somewhat more skeptical
viewpoint:<P>

"To set things in perspective, most neural networks are merely 
computer programs that run on traditional computers. There are 
very few neural networks that are implemented in hardware and 
could be termed 'neural network computers.' Having said that,
yes, a 
neural network can 'learn' from experience. In fact, the most 
common application of neural networks is to 'train' a neural
network 
to produce a specific pattern as its output when it is presented
with a 
given pattern as its input. Neural networks are typically
trained to 
do this for a large collection of input/output pattern pairs. In
many 
cases, the ability of the neural network to produce the correct 
response extends beyond the patterns it has been taught to other

similar but novel patterns. This ability, commonly known as 
'generalization,' is often what is more critical than the
ability to learn 
a small set of facts.<P>

"Can neural networks become 'smart'? Depends on how 'smart' is 
defined. For instance, a neural network can be 'trained' to
control an 
electric motor, perhaps even as well as a human operator.
However, 
that is all the neural network can do. Its 'smartness' is
confined to a 
single task, which is not what 'smart' typically implies.<P>

"Could two different neural networks teach each other what they 
know ? Given that neural networks possess very specialized 
knowledge, this question can only be considered in the context
of two 
networks that know something about the same type of problem.
That 
is, it would not be meaningful to talk about a neural network
that 
can play backgammon interacting with one that can control an 
electric motor. However, even if the neural networks in question

have knowledge about the same problem, adding new knowledge to 
an existing neural network will typically corrupt what the
network 
already knows. While the network may be capable of assimilating 
the old and the new knowledge, this would in all likelihood
require 
that the network re-learn both the old and the new concepts."<P>

<A NAME="q1d">"What is 'fuzzy logic'? Are there computers that
are inherently
fuzzy and do not apply the usual binary logic?"
</A></B></FONT><P>

<P>-<I>Mohamad Kaissi, Beirut, Lebanon</I>
<P>

Your confusion is understandable; the term "fuzzy logic" is now
as likely to
appear in advertising copy as in technical journals. A number of
workers
wrote in to share their perception of this dynamic area of
research.<P>

<A HREF="http://www.cs.ucsd.edu/users/elkan">Charles Elkan</A>,
an assistant professor
of computer science and engineering at the University of
California at San
Diego, offers the following definition:<P>

"Fuzzy logic is a generalization of standard logic, in which a
concept can
possess a degree of truth anywhere between 0.0 and 1.0. Standard
logic
applies only to concepts that are completely true (having degree
of truth 1.0)
or completely false (having degree of truth 0.0). Fuzzy logic is
supposed to
be used for reasoning about inherently vague concepts, such as
'tallness.'
For example, we might say that 'President Clinton is tall,' with
degree of
truth of 0.9.<P>

"It turns out that the useful applications of fuzzy logic are
not in
high-level artificial intelligence but rather in lower-level
machine
control, especially in consumer products. Usually, fuzzy
controllers are
implemented as software running on standard microprocessors. A
few
special-purpose microprocessors have been built that do fuzzy
operations
directly in hardware, but even these use digital binary (0 or 1)
signals at
the lowest hardware level. There are some research prototypes of
computer
chips that use analog signals at the lowest level, but these
chips simulate
the operation of neurons rather than fuzzy logic."<P>

<A HREF="http://anytime.cs.umass.edu/%7Eshlomo/">Shlomo
Zilberstein</A>, an assistant
professor in the computer science department at the University
of Massachusetts
at Amherst, provides additional information and more fuzzy
analysis of the
U.S. president:<P>

"Fuzzy logic is a technique for representing and manipulating
uncertain
information. In the more traditional propositional logic, each
fact or
proposition, such as 'it will rain tomorrow,' must be either
true or false.
Yet much of the information that people use about the world
involves some
degree of uncertainty. Like probability theory, fuzzy logic
attaches numeric
values between 0 and 1 to each proposition in order to represent
uncertainty. But whereas probability theory measures how likely
the
proposition is to be correct, fuzzy logic measures the degree to
which the
proposition is correct. For example, the proposition 'President
Clinton is
young' may have a degree of correctness 0.8.<P>

"The important distinction between probabilistic information and
fuzzy logic
is that there is no uncertainty about the age of the president
but rather
about the degree to which he matches the category 'young.' Many
terms, such as
'tall,' 'rich,' 'famous' or 'dark,' are valid only to a certain
degree when
applied to a particular individual or situation. Fuzzy logic
tries to
measure that degree and to allow computers to manipulate such
information.<P>

"Fuzzy logic was formulated by <A
HREF="http://http.cs.berkeley.edu/csbrochure/faculty/zadeh.html">Lotfi
Zadeh</A> of the
University of California at Berkeley in the mid-1960s, based on
earlier work
in the area of fuzzy set theory. Zadeh also formulated the
notion of fuzzy
control that allows a small set of 'intuitive rules' to be used
in order to
control the operation of electronic devices. In the 1980s fuzzy
control
became a huge industry in Japan and other countries where it was
integrated
into home appliances such as vacuum cleaners, microwave ovens
and video
cameras. Such appliances could adapt automatically to different
conditions;
for instance, a vacuum cleaner would apply more suction to an
especially
dirty area. One of the benefits of fuzzy control is that it can
be easily
implemented on a standard computer.<P>

"Despite its commercial success, fuzzy logic remains a
controversial idea
within the artificial-intelligence community. Many researchers
question the
consistency and validity of the methods used to 'reason' with
fuzzy logic."<P>

Jacoby Carter of the National Biological Service's National
Wetlands
Research Center in Lafayette, La., clarifies the difference
between fuzzy
and traditional logic; he also offers a more upbeat assessment
of the
potential of fuzzy logic for artificial intelligence (AI):<P>

"Traditional logic theory, sometimes called 'crisp logic,' uses
three logic
operations--AND, OR and NOT--and returns either a 0 or 1.
Similarly,
traditional set theory, or 'crisp set theory,' assigns to
objects either
membership or nonmembership in a class or group that has been
assigned
strict mathematical boundaries so that, for example, 80 degrees
Fahrenheit
is warm and 81 degrees F is hot. In fuzzy logic, the three
operations AND,
OR and NOT return a degree of membership that is a number
between 0 and 1.<P>

"Fuzzy set theory has been used in commercial applications of
expert systems
and control devices for trains and elevators; it has also been
combined with
neural nets to control the manufacture of semiconductors. By
incorporating
fuzzy logic and fuzzy sets in production systems, significant
improvements
have been gained in many AI systems. This approach has been
particularly
successful with ambiguous data sets or when the rules are
imperfectly
known."<P>

<A HREF="http://virage.tech.uh.edu/faculty/malki.htm">Heidar A.
Malki</A>, an assistant
professor in the College of Technology at the University of
Houston,
provided further perspective on the likely applications of fuzzy
logic:<P>

"Increasingly, people in industry and academia are exploring the
benefits of
of fuzzy logic and its related technologies. Fuzzy logic can be
used for
situations in which conventional logic technologies are not
effective, such
as systems and devices that cannot be precisely described by
mathematical
models, those that have significant uncertainties or
contradictory
conditions, and linguistically controlled devices or systems. As
Lotfi
Zadeh once stated, fuzzy logic is not going to replace
conventional logic
(computers) or methodologies, rather it will supplement them in
circumstances where conventional approaches fail to solve a
problem
effectively.<P>

"In recent years, there has been a growing interest in fuzzy
logic, both in
industry and academia. Current applications include modeling,
evaluation,
optimization, decision making, control, diagnosis and
information. In
particular, fuzzy logic is best suited for control-systems
fields. For
instance, fuzzy logic has been applied in areas such as
breakdown prediction
of nuclear reactors in Europe, earthquake forecasting in China,
and subway
control in Japan.<P>

"One prominent application of fuzzy logic is in the anti-lock
braking system
found in many modern automobiles. The control rules that
describe an
anti-lock braking system may consist of parameters such as the
car's speed,
the brake pressure, the brake temperature, the interval between
applications
of the brakes and the angle of the car's lateral motion to its
forward
motion. The range of values of these parameters are all
continuous, open to
interpretation by a design engineer. One such rule in an
anti-lock braking
system could be:<P>

<CODE>IF brake temperature is 'warm' AND speed is 'not very
fast,' then brake
pressure is 'slightly decreased.'</CODE><P>

"The temperature might have a range of states such as cold,
cool, warm and
hot; the range of these linguistic terms can be precisely
determined by
defining membership functions by an expert. <P>

"There are many consumer products that use fuzzy logic in their
operation.
There are also many fuzzy logic chips (processors) that are
built to do
special tasks without using conventional computers. The outlook
for fuzzy
logic is therefore very promising."<P>

Not everybody can ignore the humorous potential in a concept
such as fuzzy
logic. Jim Diederich, a professor of mathematics at the
University of
California at Davis, is working on the applications of fuzzy
logic in
biological systems. He recently tried out fuzzy logic techniques
on one
specialized set of biological systems--his students--when he
proposed the
following rules for one of his courses:<P>

"Where did the earth's atmospheric oxygen come from? If

all the reduced carbon go (the fossil-fuel reserves don't seem
nearly large enough)? Could some of the oxygen have come from
water that was split by ultraviolet rays?"

<P>--<I>Peter Berenyi<br> Budapest, Hungary</I>

<P><A
HREF="http://www-space.arc.nasa.gov/division/people/desmarais_d.html"TARGET="_top"">David
J. Des Marais</A>, a researcher in the <A
HREF="http://www-space.arc.nasa.gov/division/ssx/ssx.html"TARGET="_top"">Exobiology
Branch</A> of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
Ames Research Center, has studied this very question. Here is
his response:

<P>"The questioner is a remarkably perceptive individual! He is
absolutely correct that an equivalent amount of photosynthetic
organic matter must be buried in the earth's crust to account
for the free oxygen in the atmosphere. And in fact, there is not
nearly enough fossil fuel to account for the atmospheric oxygen
inventory. But there is a <I>lot more</I> organic matter buried
in the crust in the form of finely disseminated particles
incorporated in shales and limestones.

<P>"Organic matter in shales is the dominant reduced carbon
reservoir. The earth's crust contains 1.1 x 10<sup>21</sup> moles of
reduced carbon--that is, carbon that has been freed from its
oxygen (one mole of an element is equal to 6.02 x 10<sup>23</sup>
atoms of that substance). The total amount of organic carbon
needed to account for all the oxygen in the atmosphere is only
0.038 x 10<sup>21</sup> moles! In other words, based on the amount of
buried carbon, the atmosphere seems to contain far too
<I>little</I> oxygen. Some of that missing oxygen has gone into
other materials, 'oxidizing' them in the process. Oxidized
reservoirs whose oxygen probably derives from organic matter are
sulfate, found in both seawater and evaporite rocks (equivalent
to 0.48 x 10<sup>21</sup> moles of organics) and in ferric iron
(equivalent to 0.064 x 10<sup>21</sup> moles).

<P>"Clearly, there is more organic matter in the crust than can be
accounted for only by the amount of oxygen in the air and in
these oxidized reservoirs. The additional organic matter must
have come from anaerobic bacteria that converted carbon dioxide
to organics via processes that do not create free oxygen. (These
bacteria use reduced chemical species from weathered igneous
rocks and from emanations of volcanic/hydrothermal gases and
fluids.)

<P>"Oxygen can also be made by the splitting of water molecules by
ultraviolet radiation from the sun, a process called
photodissociation. The only way that any free oxygen product can
accumulate, however, is if some of the hydrogen that is produced
at the same time escapes into space, permanently removing it
from the atmosphere. (Otherwise the hydrogen and the oxygen just
recombine into water again.) The rate of net oxygen production
by ultraviolet photodissociation is equal to the rate at which
the hydrogen escapes to space. This rate is so low that this
source of free oxygen is trivial compared with the amount of
oxygen created by biological activity."

"Periodically I hear stories about ball lightning. Does
this phenomenon really exist? Could a ball of plasma remain
stable for several seconds, as some researchers have claimed?"
</A></B></FONT>

<P>-<I>Chris Sparrow<BR> Toronto, Ontario Canada</I>

<P>Ball lightning may be more exotic than microwave oven sparks,
but most scientists are convinced that it is no less real. <A
HREF="http://www. ece.ufl.edu/profs/uman.html">Martin A.
Uman</A>, chair of the department of electrical computer
engineering at the University of Florida at Gainesville
explains:

<P>"Ball lightning is a well-documented phenomenon in the sense
that it has been seen and consistently described by people in
all walks of life since the time of the ancient Greeks. There is
no accepted theory for what causes it. It does not necessarily
consist of plasma; for example, ball lightning could be the
result of a chemiluminescent process. The literature abounds
with speculations on the physics of the ball lightning."

<P>Peter H. Handel in the <A
HREF="http://newton.umsl.edu/research.html"> department of
physics and astronomy</A> at the University of Missouri at St.
Louis provided a detailed overview and advances his favored
model of ball lightning:

<P>"According to statistical investigations carried out by J. R.
McNally in 1960 (J. R. McNally, "Preliminary Report on Ball
Lightning" in <I> Proceedings of the Second Annual Meeting of
the Division of Plasma Physics of the American Physical
Society</I>, Gatlinburg, No. 2AD5 [1960], Paper J-15, pp.
1AD25), ball lightning has been seen by 5 percent of the
population of the earth. This percentage is about the same as
the fraction of the population that has seen an ordinary
lightning strike at close range--that is, close enough to see
the direct point of the lightning impact.

<P>"Ball lightning was seen and described since antiquity, often by
groups of people, and recorded in many places. It is in general
described as a luminous sphere, most often the size of a small
child's head. It appears usually during thunderstorms, sometimes
within a few seconds of lightning but sometimes without apparent
connection to a lightning bolt. In some cases, ball lightning
appears after a thunderstorm--or even before it. Its lifetime
varies widely, ranging from a few seconds to several minutes;
the average duration is about 25 seconds. The lifetime of ball
lightning tends to increase with size and decrease with
brightness. Balls that appear distinctly orange and blue seem to
last longer than average. Many of these general characteristics
are based on the work of A. I. Grigoriev, who analyzed more than
10,000 cases of ball lightning (A.I. Grigoriev, " Statistical
Analysis of the Ball Lightning Properties," in <I>Science of
Ball Lightning</I>, edited by Y. H. Ohtsuki, World Scientific
Publishing Co., Singapore, 1988, pp. 88AD134).

<P>"Ball lightning usually moves parallel to the earth, but it
takes vertical jumps. Sometimes it descends from the clouds,
other times it suddenly materializes either indoors or outdoors
or enters a room through a closed or open window, through thin
nonmetallic walls or through the chimney. When it passes through
closed windows, the lightning ball damages them with small holes
about one third of the time. The balls have no observable
buoyancy effect. All these attributes led the great Russian
physicist Pyotr Kapitsa in 1955 to interpret ball lightning as
an electrodeless discharge caused by a standing UHF waves of
unknown origin present between the earth and the cloud; earlier
versions of this idea date back to the 1930s.

<P>"Scientists have since refined Kapitsa's speculation. The
Maser-Soliton Theory, which I first described in 1975 (P.H.
Handel, "Maser Theory of Ball Lightning" in <I>Bulletin of the
American Physical Society</I> Series II, Vol. 20 [1975], No.
26), is the present-day version of the UHF discharge approach. I
have been directing research on the Maser-Soliton Theory at the
Kurchatov Scientific Center in Moscow since 1992. According to
this theory, outdoor ball lightning is caused by an atmospheric
maser-- analogous to a laser, but operating at a much lower
energy--having a volume of the order of many cubic kilometers.

<P>"In technical terms, the maser is generated by a population
inversion induced in the rotational energy levels of the water
molecules by the short field pulse associated with streak
lightning. The large volume of air that is affected by the
strike makes it difficult for photons to escape before they
cause 'microwave amplification by stimulated emission of
radiation' (the maser effect). Unless the volume of air is very
large or else is enclosed in a conducting cavity (as is the case
of ball lightning in airplanes or submarines and to a certain
degree also indoors), collisions between the molecules will
consume all the energy of the population inversion. If the
volume is large, the maser can generate a localized electrical
field or soliton that gives rise to the observed ball lightning.
Such a discharge has not yet been created in the laboratory,
however.

<P>"The Maser-Soliton Theory is supported by three well-known
facts. First, ball lightning never occurs on sharp mountain
peaks, high-rise buildings and other high points that attract
lightning and that are used for lightning research by
specialists in atmospheric electricity. (Lightning researcher
Karl Berger told me he spent his life registering and measuring
hundreds of thousands of lightning discharges hitting his
laboratory on top of Mount Salvatore in Lugano, Italy, without
getting a trace of ball lightning.) The inability to observe
ball lightning in such settings has led to widespread
frustration and even skepticism about the reality of the
phenomenon. But in fact, the field pulse of the lightning
striking high, peaked objects is localized in a narrow cone that
encloses a relatively small volume. According to the
Maser-Soliton Theory, this environment precludes the maser
effect. On the other hand, when lightning strikes the flatlands,
the resulting field pulse is huge: about 10 kilometers wide and
three kilometers high. Ball lightning thus keeps its secrets: it
visits the farmer and avoids the scientist!

<P>"Second, ball lightning is harmless inside airplanes and
submarines or in homes that have a conducting frame. Again
according to the Maser-Soliton Theory, the energy of the maser
in such settings is limited to about 10 joules (contrasted to a
limit of 10<SUP>9</SUP> to 10<SUP>10</SUP> joules in the open air), too
little to be dangerous to life.

<P>"And third, open-air ball lightning often ends with a violent
explosion, sometimes causing extensive damage. The explosion is
particularly strange because it violently displaces conducting
objects to a larger degree than dielectrics. For instance,
electric connection boxes are sometimes extracted from within
the walls of houses by outdoor ball lightning and thrown in the
middle of the street. The Maser-Soliton Theory predicts that
such spiking would occur when the load suddenly disappears.
(When the discharge that was consuming the photons generated by
the maser suddenly disappears, these photons get to live longer
and to multiply instantly, unbounded by the maser effect. This
proliferation triggers an even larger instantaneous avalanche of
photons and a practically instantaneous exponential growth of
the electrical field. The increase occurs too rapidly to cause
electric breakdown or heating but could cause very large '
ponderomotive forces'--mechanical effects that can tear apart
composite objects having varied dielectric constants.)

<P>"The pioneering UHF discharge ball-lightning experiments of
Ohtsuki and Ofuruton in Japan (Y. H. Ohtsuki and H. Ofuruton,
'Plasma Fireballs Formed by Microwave Interference In Air' in
<I>Nature</I> Vol. 350 (1991), page 139) and the above-mentioned
research at Kurchatov in Moscow (V. A. Zhil' tsov, C9. A.
Manykin, E. A. Petrenko; and A. A. Skovoroda, J. F. Leitner and
P. H. Handel, 'Spatially Localized Microwave Discharge in the
Atmosphere,' in <I>JETP</I> Vol. 81 [1995] ,pp. 1072-81) have
aided in the solution of the ball-lightning enigma. Now that we
seem to understand the true nature of ball lightning, it is

"Why do hurricanes hit the East Coast of the U.S. but never the
West Coast?
Hurricanes do form in the Pacific Ocean, just as they do in the
Atlantic,
but none of these storms seem to reach the continental U.S. Why
not?"</A></B></FONT>

<P>-<I>Bryce Wagner<BR> Lincoln, Neb.</I>

<P>Chris W. Landsea is a researcher at the Atlantic
Oceanographic and
Meteorological Laboratory/<A
HREF="http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/">Hurricane Research
Division</A> of
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA),
located in
Miami, Fla. He replies:

<P>"Hurricanes form both in the Atlantic basin, to the east of
the
continental U.S. (that is, in the Atlantic Ocean, the Gulf of
Mexico and
the Caribbean Sea), and in the Northeast Pacific basin, to the
west of the
U.S. The hurricanes in the Northeast Pacific almost never hit
the U.S.,
however, whereas the ones in the Atlantic basin strike the U.S.
mainland
just less than twice a year on average.

<P>"There are two main reasons for this disparity. The first is
that
hurricanes in the northern hemisphere form at tropical and
subtropical
latitudes and then tend to move toward the west-northwest. In
the
Atlantic, such a motion often brings the hurricane into the
vicinity of
the East Coast of the U.S. In the Northeast Pacific, the same
west-northwest track carries hurricanes farther offshore, well
away from
the U.S. West Coast. 

<P>"The second factor is the difference in water temperatures
along the U.S.
East and West coasts. Along the East Coast, the Gulf Stream
provides a
source of warm (above 80 degrees Fahrenheit, or 26.5 degrees
Celsius)
waters, which helps to maintain the hurricane. Along the West
Coast,
however, ocean-surface temperatures rarely rise above the lower
70s F.
(the low 20s C.), even in the middle of summer. Such relatively
cool
temperatures do not provide enough thermal energy to sustain a
hurricane's
strength. So the occasional Northeast Pacific hurricane that
does track
back toward the U.S. encounters the cooler waters of the
Pacific, which
can quickly reduce the storm's strength."

<P><A HREF="http://www-cmpo.mit.edu/~emanuel/home.html">Kerry
Emanuel</A> in
the Center for Meteorology and Physical Oceanography at the
Massachusetts
Institute of Technology expands on the details of hurricane
behavior:

<P>"Hurricanes almost always form over ocean water warmer than
about 80
degrees F. in a belt of generally east-to-west flow called the
trade
winds. They move westward with the trade winds and also drift
slowly
poleward. Eventually, if they last long enough, they will drift
poleward
far enough to enter the belt of westerly winds that prevails in
middle
latitudes. When this happens, the hurricanes 'recurve' toward
the east and
thereafter follow paths that are generally both eastward and
poleward. 

<P>"In the Atlantic region, hurricanes form anywhere from the
tropical
central Atlantic to the Gulf of Mexico. Those that form in the
central
Atlantic and Caribbean region usually start off moving westward;
when they
recurve, they may strike the North American mainland. Some of
the storms
that begin in the Gulf of Mexico may move poleward and eastward
right from
their inception. 

<P>"In the eastern Pacific region, one has to go all the way
down to the
central Mexico coastline to find water warm enough to sustain
hurricanes.
This warm water lies well within the belt of easterly winds, so
almost all
the storms that form there move away from the coast, toward the
west. By
the time those storms recurve, they are usually many thousands
of
kilometers west of the coast of North America. 

<P>"A few storms recurve right next to the coast. Some of these
make it as
far north as Baja California and can strike land with
hurricane-force
winds. But to make it all the way to the U.S. West Coast, the
storms have
to traverse a long stretch of ocean water that is far too cold
to sustain
hurricanes. Occasionally, tropical storms do strike coastal
southern
California. By the time they do, they have lost their
hurricane-force
winds, although they may still bring with them very heavy
rainfall that
can cause extensive flooding. 

<P>"Essentially, the very cold water that upwells off the
California coast
and gives coastal California such a cool, benign climate also
protects it
from hurricanes. <A

"Why are snowflakes symmetrical? How can ice crystallizing on one
arm 'know' the shape of the other arms on the flake?"</A></B></FONT>

<P>-<I>Victor Andersen<BR> Santa Clara, Calif.</I>

<P>Miriam Rossi, an associate professor of chemistry at <A
HREF="http://www.vassar.edu/" TARGET="_top">Vassar College</A>, offers the
following reply:

<P>"Snowflakes are symmetrical because they reflect the internal
order of the water molecules as they arrange themselves in the
solid state (the process of crystallization). Water molecules in
the solid state, such as in ice and snow, form weak bonds
(called hydrogen bonds) to one another. These ordered
arrangements result in the basic symmetrical, <A HREF="http://
www.dir.ucar.edu/iss/dmc/1123.gif" TARGET="_top">hexagonal shape</A> of the
snowflake. In reality, there are many different types of
snowflakes (as in the clich&eacute; that 'no two snowflakes are
alike'); this differentiation occurs because each snowflake is a
separate crystal that is subject to the specific atmospheric
conditions, notably temperature and humidity, under which it is
formed.

<P>"The second question has to do with the way in which snowflakes
are formed. The growth of snowflakes (or of any substance
changing from a liquid to a solid state) is known as
crystallization. During this process, the molecules (in this
case, water molecules) align themselves to maximize attractive
forces and minimize repulsive ones. As a result, the water
molecules arrange themselves in predetermined spaces and in a
specific arrangement. This process is much like tiling a floor
in accordance with a specific pattern: once the pattern is
chosen and the first tiles are placed, then all the other tiles
must go in predetermined spaces in order to maintain the pattern
of symmetry. Water molecules simply arrange themselves to fit
the spaces and maintain symmetry; in this way, the different
arms of the snowflake are formed."

<P>Howard T. Evans, Jr., an x-ray crystallographer who is now
scientist emeritus at the U.S. Geological Survey, adds a few
details:

<P>"Snowflakes are mysterious things. Their fundamental form
derives from the arrangement of the water molecules in the ice
crystal. When a liquid freezes, the molecules tend to settle in
the lowest-energy state, and that almost always involves some
form of symmetry. The higher the symmetry, the more stable the
crystal is.

<P>"Water molecules floating freely begin to arrange themselves
into a crystalline solid when the temperature drops below
freezing. Because of the dipolar shape of the water molecules,
they link together in a pattern that naturally takes on a <A
HREF="http://www.dir.ucar.edu/iss/dmc/1124.gif" TARGET="_top">hexagonal
form</A>. (This molecular organization explains one of the
extremely unusual properties of water: its solid form takes up
more space than its liquid form, so ice floats on water.) Hence,
the snowflakes have a fundamental hexagonal symmetry.

<P>"But why are snowflake shapes so elaborate? Nobody has a good
answer for that. The general explanation is that snowflakes form
in the atmosphere where conditions are very complex and
variable. A crystal might begin to grow in one manner and then
minutes or even seconds later something changes (temperature or
humidity), so it starts to grow in another manner. The hexagonal
symmetry is maintained, but the ice crystal may branch off in
new directions. The changes in environmental conditions take
place over a large area compared with the size of a single
snowflake, so all regions of the flake are similarly affected.
In the end, there are all kinds of forms that can arise:
everything from <A HREF="http://www.dir.ucar.edu/

"Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are heavier than air, so how do scientists
suppose that these chemicals reach the altitude of the ozone layer to adversely
affect it?"</A></B></FONT>

<P>-<I>J. H. Hedden<BR> Miami, Fla.</I>

<P>Jean M. Andino, in the department of environmental engineering sciences
at the University of Florida, replies:

<P>"One must consider two issues: the mechanisms for mixing between the
troposphere (the bottom layer of the atmosphere) and the overlying
stratosphere, and the average time that CFCs remain in the troposphere
before chemical processes scrub them from the air. In very general terms,
mixing within the atmosphere is caused by differences in temperature and by
pressure gradients. These irregularities make some parcels of air buoyant,
which results in the transport of pollutants throughout the atmosphere.
Given sufficiently large variations in temperature and pressure, air parcels
containing contaminants can be transported through the troposphere and into
the stratosphere, in much the way that a hot air balloon can be used to loft
people high above the ground and transport them from one place to another.
Pollutants can reach the stratosphere, however, only if there are no major
mechanisms that pull them out of the air while they are still in the
troposphere.

<P>"In general, there are two main mechanisms that remove compounds in the
atmosphere: deposition and reaction. A common example of deposition is 'rain
out': compounds that are soluble in water can be removed from the atmosphere
by precipitation. This phenomenon is responsible for acid rain. The most
abundant CFCs emitted into the troposphere are CFC 11 and CFC 12. These CFCs
are not soluble in water, so deposition does not removed them from the air. 

<P>"The only other mechanism that removes compounds from the troposphere is
reaction with an abundant oxidizing agent--such as hydroxyl radicals, ozone,
or nitrate radicals. Atmospheric researchers have determined the rates at
which several CFCs react with hydroxyl radicals; the lifetimes for these
CFCs with respect to hydroxyl radicals is approximately 80 years. In other
words, if hydroxyl radicals were the only thing reacting with the CFCs, it
would take 80 years to completely remove them from the atmosphere. That is a
long time! In comparison, methanol, a component of some alternative fuels,
has a lifetime with respect to hydroxyl radical reaction of just 17 days.
Ozone and nitrate radicals are even less effective at breaking down CFCs.

<P>"Because CFCs are so long-lived in the lower atmosphere, there is ample time
and opportunity for them to become well mixed and eventually to reach the
stratosphere."

<P><A HREF="http://chem.ps.uci.edu/research/faculty/rowland.html">F. Sherwood
Rowland</A>
of the University of California at Irvine, who won a Nobel Prize for his
work on atmospheric chemistry, answers:

<P>"This is indeed a persistent question--so much so that the most recent
report of <A HREF="http://www.wmo.ch/">the World Meteorological Organization</A>,
entitled '<A
HREF="http://www.al.noaa.gov/WWWHD/pubdocs/WMOUNEP94.html">Scientific
Assessment of Ozone Depletion: 1994,</A>' included it among a list of common
questions that have been persistently raised and long since answered. Susan
Solomon of NOAA Aeronomy Laboratory in Boulder and I are listed in the
document as the Coordinators of Common Questions about Ozone. We had as many
as 22 of them, but pared them down to the most frequently asked ones.

<P>"The response to this particular question reads as follows."
        
<blockquote>
<BR><center><H4>HOW CAN CHLOROFLUOROCARBONS (CFCs) GET TO THE STRATOSPHERE IF
THEY'RE
HEAVIER THAN AIR?</H4></center>
        
Although the CFC molecules are indeed several times heavier than air,
thousands of measurements have been made from balloons, aircraft and
satellites demonstrating that the CFCs are actually present in the
stratosphere. The atmosphere is not stagnant. Winds mix the atmosphere to
altitudes far above the top of the stratosphere much faster than molecules
can settle according to their weight. Gases such as CFCs that are insoluble
in water and relatively unreactive in the lower atmosphere (below about 10
kilometers) are quickly mixed and therefore reach the stratosphere
regardless of their weight. 

<P>Much can be learned about the atmospheric fate of compounds from the
measured changes in concentration versus altitude. For example, the two
gases carbon tetrafluoride (CF<SUB>4</SUB>, produced mainly as a by-product
of the manufacture of aluminum) and CFC-11 (CCl<SUB>3</SUB>F, used in a
variety of human activities) are both much heavier than air. Carbon
tetrafluoride is completely unreactive in the lower 99.9 percent of the
atmosphere, and measurements show it to be nearly uniformly distributed
throughout the atmosphere as shown in the figure. There have also been
measurements over the past two decades of several other completely
unreactive gases, one lighter than air (neon) and some heavier than air
(argon, krypton), which show that they also mix upward uniformly through the
stratosphere regardless of their weight, just as observed with carbon
tetrafluoride. CFC-11 is unreactive in the lower atmosphere (below about 15
kilometers) and is similarly uniformly mixed there, as shown. The abundance
of CFC-11 decreases as the gas reaches higher altitudes, where it is broken
down by high energy solar ultraviolet radiation. Chlorine released from this
breakdown of CFC-11 and other CFCs remains in the stratosphere for several
years, where it destroys many thousands of molecules of ozone. 
</blockquote>

<P>"The measurements of CFC-11 in the stratosphere were first described in 1975
by two research groups in Boulder, Colorado, and have been similarly
observed innumerable times since. The uniform mixing of CF4 versus altitude
was reported from balloons around 1980 and many times since, and from an
infrared instrument aboard the space shuttle Challenger (which exploded in
1986) in 1985. My own research group has measured CFC-11 in hundreds of air
canisters filled while flying in the NASA DC-8. We once did a descent
directly over the North Pole and found uniform mixing in the lower
atmosphere, and slightly less CFC-11 in the stratosphere."

<A NAME="q7">"I lived a long time in the tropics and often heard
of, but never saw, the
"green flash" that is said to occur just at sundown. Does it
actually exist,
and if so, what causes it?"
</A></B></FONT><P>
<I> -Kaa Byington<BR> San Francisco, Calif.</I><P>
 
Jerry Nelson of Lick Observatory and the University of
California at  Santa
Cruz passed along the following information about the mysterious
"green
flash":<P>

"The green flash does indeed exist. It occurs when the sun is
rising or
setting. It is a consequence of the dispersion of light by air.
Light from
the sun is bent (refracted) by the Earth's atmosphere; the
shorter the
wavelength, the greater the amount of bending. Hence, blue light
is bent
more than green, which is bent more than yellow, which is bent
more than
red. Further, the amount of bending increases as the sun
approaches the
horizon. <P>

"By the time the apparent sun (that is, the sun as we see it in
the sky)
just starts to set, the actual sun (as we would see it if there
were no atmospheric
refraction) has completely set. The bending due to refraction at
sunset is
just about 0.5 degree--roughly the same as the angular diameter
of the disk
of the sun. One can imagine the image of the sun in the various
colors of
the spectrum, each deflected a slightly different amount by
refraction. At
the horizon, the blue apparent sun is highest and the red
apparent sun is
the lowest. This color shift is rather small, even at the
horizon, but it is
key to understanding the green flash. <P>

"Note also that the atmosphere scatters blue light much more
effectively
than red light. (That is why the sky appears blue.) When the sun
is setting,
its light passes through a lot of atmosphere. As a result, the
light of the
blue sun is strongly scattered and attenuated. The green sun,
however, is
less diminished by scattering. <P>

"In the evening, the red sun sets first, so there is a period
when the red
sun has set but the green sun--or at least a tiny sliver of
it--is still
above the horizon. Thus, at the last moments of a sunset we can
get a green
image of the upper edge of the sun: the green flash. If it were
not for the
scattering of the atmosphere, we could get blue flashes. At
sites that have
very clear air, one sometimes can see turquoise flashes. <P>

"All of this happens much more clearly when the sunset is truly
at the
horizon, so sunsets over the ocean in a cloudless sky offer the
best chance
of catching the green flash. Sunsets occur more quickly near the
equator
than at higher latitudes, so the green flash is a shorter
phenomenon in the
tropics. It is sometimes easier to see the green flash through
binoculars,
but DO NOT STARE AT THE SETTING SUN. Wait until just a few
seconds before
the end of the sunset to look with binoculars. <P>

"The green flash is gorgeous, and well worth the patience it
takes to find
an appropriately clear day during sunset (or sunrise)."<P>

<A HREF="http://albert.astro.williams.edu/jpasachoff/">Jay M.
Pasachoff</A>, Field
Memorial Professor of Astronomy at Williams College in
Williamstown, Mass.,
adds some details to the above explanation:<P>

"The green flash is visible at sunrise and sunset when you have
a perfect
view of the horizon; it is usually best seen when you are
looking over the
ocean. Atmospheric refraction spreads out the sun's image, with
red at the
bottom and blue at the top. Think of an overlapping set of disks
in the
colors ROY G BIV (red orange yellow green blue indigo violet).
<P>

"The blue-indigo-violet colors do not come through the
atmosphere because of
intense Rayleigh scattering when the sun is low above the
horizon. Further,
when the sun is low, the orange and yellow are absorbed by water
vapor. So
we get a green image above the red image, with the two largely
overlapping.
When the red image entirely sets, the top of the green image is
visible, but
only briefly--for a second or so. The brevity of the green flash
is one of
the reasons it is so rarely seen.<P>

"A photograph of the green flash appears in the book 'A Field
Guide to the
Stars and Planets' by Jay M. Pasachoff and Donald H. Menzel
(Peterson Field
Guide Series, Houghton Mifflin, 2nd ed., 1992) on page 54, with
an
explanation of the phenomenon on page 422."<P>

<I>-Robin Luethe, Chehalis<BR>Washington</I><P>

Carbon in trash does return to the environment, but slowly, as
Ted Lindeman of the chemistry department at Colorado College
explains:<P>

"The disposal of paper, plastic, and other carbonaceous
materials
doesn't remove them from the great "carbon cycle," although it
surely delays their decomposition back to carbon dioxide. The
extent of the delay may be a year or a millennium depending on
the material, and on the management (if any) of the land-fill.
My
quick estimate is that for each North American, something like 5
pounds per day of solid waste (of which perhaps 3.5 to 4 pounds
is carbon) gets buried, while close to 100 pounds per day of
carbon gets added to the atmosphere to provide energy.
Landfilled
carbon is not a trivial contributor, but energy use
predominates."<P>

Robert M. Cushman, the director of the Carbon Dioxide
Information
Analysis Center at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, puts those
numbers in a more global context. According to a 1993 report by
the Environmental Protection Agency, he says, the amount of
carbon in U.S. landfills from discarded forest products--wood
and
paper-- increased by at least 16 million metric tons in 1990.
(The real total is certainly higher, because not all waste
carbon
ends up in landfills.) For comparison, the Carbon Dioxide
Information Analysis Center estimates that, in the same year,
fossil-fuel combustion and cement manufacture in the U.S.
emitted
1,322 million tons of carbon into the atmosphere. Cushman
invites
interested parties to visit his <A
HREF="http://cdiac.esd.ornl.gov/">Center's World-Wide-Web
site</A>  for more global-change data.<P>

Although the quantities may seem small, Alex E.S. Green of the
Clean Combustion Technology at the University of Florida, notes
that we should worry about the carbon coming out of the
landfills
as well:<P>

"The carbon we put into the ground in the form of paper and wood
will largely be released back to the atmosphere as carbon
dioxide
or methane, either through oxidation or through digestion by
anaerobic bacteria. Although the carbon released through such
gasification is only about 5 percent of that generated from
burning fossil fuels, it actually makes a significant
contribution to the greenhouse effect because much of the carbon
is in the form of methane. Each molecule of methane has a much
greater greenhouse impact than a molecule of carbon dioxide.
Thus, it would be wiser to thermally gasify waste paper and wood
for use in efficient gas turbines--this would convert the waste
back into carbon dioxide and provide useful energy.<P>

"Plastics are mostly derived from petroleum and so represent
carbon extracted from the atmosphere in earlier geologic eras
that is released into today's atmosphere. Unless the plastic is
biodegradable, the carbon will remain in plastic form for a long
time, but it will still eventually be converted to methane and
carbon dioxide. Again, gasification for use in gas turbines
would
lower the greenhouse impact.<P>

"So yes," he concludes, "buried garbage does significantly
affect
carbon in the air, and there are more environmentally sensible
disposal options than landfill."<P>

"</A></B></FONT><P>
<P><I>-Ferris Stout, Roosevelt<BR> New Jersey</I><P>

Questions about global warming are always controversial. There
is
no unambiguous way to measure weather or climate over the entire
globe, and computer climate models are limited by incomplete
understanding about the behavior of the atmosphere. We offer
here
more responses to your question.<P>

A response from Andrew Weaver of the University of
Victoria.
He was the lead author of two chapters in the
second report by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC). He offers here a view which reflects the
information reported by the U.N.:<P>

Global Warming refers to the increase in the globally averaged
atmospheric temperature (at the Earth's surface) that scientists
think will occur because of increasing atmospheric greenhouse
gases, primarily carbon dioxide. Greenhouse gases act to trap
outgoing infrared radiation, which the earth emits to space, and
then to re-radiate this heat back to the Earth's surface.
Recently it has become apparent that one must also account for
the effects of atmospheric aerosols, such as sulfates, which are
released to the atmosphere in highly industrial areas (for
example, the eastern U.S., western Europe, Southeast Asia).
Aerosols are tiny liquid or solid particles in the air that
scatter incoming solar radiation back to space and hence cool
the
planet.<P>

When the combined effects of both increasing aerosols and
greenhouse gases are taking into account, the most sophisticated
climate models suggest that the Earth will warm by about 2.0
degrees Centigrade by the year 2100. In addition, these same
models suggest a 50 centimeter (20 inch) rise in sea level by
2100. The warming is not uniform everywhere and there are in
fact
regions where one might actually expect regional cooling. These
regions are close to and downwind of major industrial areas that
produce atmospheric aerosols.<P>

The models are still not sophisticated enough yet to provide a
great deal of reliability regarding regional versus globally
averaged results. Nevertheless, these sophisticated climate
models suggest that as the climate warms one would expect warmer
and wetter winters and slightly warmer and drier summers in
middle to high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere. Averaged
over the course of the year one would expect warmer temperatures
and increased precipitation at these latitudes. There is very
little, if any, consensus as to what would happen to storms in a
warmer climate. However, there is a general consensus that the
probability for intense precipitation (and so floods) and the
occurrences of prolonged dry spells (and so droughts) will
increase in a warmer climate.<P>

Is there any observational evidence that the weather is getting
more extreme? To quote from the 2nd IPCC Assessment of Climate
Change: "Overall, there is no evidence that extreme weather
events, or climate variability, has increased, in a global
sense,
through the 20th century, although data and analyses are poor
and
not comprehensive. On regional scales there is clear evidence of
changes in some extremes and climate variability indicators.
Some
of these changes have been toward greater variability; some have
been toward lower variability." In the U.S. there is some
evidence to suggest that there has been an increase in extreme
rainfall events during this century. Furthermore, there is also
some evidence to suggest that minimum daytime temperatures have
increased and the number of days with frost has decreased in the
U.S. this century. At this stage it is premature to attribute
such changes to global warming.<P>

With reference to your question then, the regional changes in
extreme events (both increasing and decreasing), mentioned
above,
are therefore not proof that global warming is happening.
Nevertheless, a number of extremely important studies have
recently been completed by scientists at the Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory in Livermore, California. By running an
atmospheric model with pre-industrial atmospheric concentrations
of carbon dioxide and emissions of sulfate aerosols, and
comparing it with the same model run with near present-day
concentrations/emissions they were able to obtain an "expected"
pattern of global warming (which in some places was regional
cooling). They then examined the observational record and,
through sophisticated statistical techniques, appeared to see
the
emergence of the model response pattern in the observational
record. This lead to one of the most important conclusions of
the
IPCC: "Viewed as a whole, these results indicate that observed
global warming over the past 100 years is larger than our
current
best estimates of natural climate variations over the last 600
years. More importantly, there is evidence of an emerging
pattern
of climate response to forcings by greenhouse gases and sulfate
aerosols in the observed climate record. This evidence comes
from
the geographical, seasonal and vertical patterns of temperature
change. Taken together, these results point towards a human
influence on global climate."<P>

A response from Kevin Trenberth of the National Center
for
Atmospheric Research. He is involved in creating a
condensed and popularized version of the climate change report
from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change
(IPCC). He helpfully provides the introductory section to this
document, as follows:<P>

We live in and breath the atmosphere. The large fluctuations in
the atmosphere from day-to-day constitute the weather. Climate
is
usually defined to be average or prevailing weather. Climate
involves variations in which the atmosphere is influenced by and
interacts with other parts of the climate system in addition to
"external" forcings. All of the factors involved in the makeup
of
the Earth, the sun, and the orbit of the Earth around the sun
are
normally regarded as external. A change in the sun's output can
alter the climate. Or a veil of tiny particles from a volcanic
eruption can block the sun. Other external forcings occur from
human activities. The internal interactive components in the
climate system include the atmosphere, the oceans, sea ice, the
land and its features (including the vegetation and ecosystems),
snow cover, land ice, and hydrology (including rivers, lakes and
subsurface water).<P>

The source of energy which drives the climate is the radiation
from the sun. To balance the incoming energy, the Earth on
average radiates the same amount of energy back to space by
emitting thermal (infrared) radiation. The amount of thermal
radiation emitted by a surface depends on its temperature. The
bulk of the Earth's radiation to space is intercepted by the
atmosphere and re-emitted both up and down. Most of the
atmosphere consists of nitrogen and oxygen which are transparent
to infrared radiation. It is the water vapor, carbon dioxide and
some other minor gases present in the atmosphere in much smaller
quantities which absorb some of the thermal radiation leaving
the
surface and emit radiation from much higher and colder levels
out
to space. These radiatively active gases are known as greenhouse
gases because they act as a partial blanket for the thermal
radiation from the surface and enable it to be substantially
warmer than it would otherwise be, analogous to the effects of a
greenhouse. This blanketing is known as the natural greenhouse
effect. Clouds also absorb and emit thermal radiation and have a
blanketing effect similar to that of the greenhouse gases. But
clouds are also bright reflectors of solar radiation and thus
also act to cool the surface.<P>

The oceans cover 70 percent of the Earth's surface and store
heat, absorbed at the surface, for varying durations and release
it in different places. They ameliorate temperature changes over
nearby land and contribute substantially to variability of
climate. The oceans absorb carbon dioxide and other gases and
exchange them with the atmosphere in ways that change with ocean
circulation and climate change. However, land does not store
much
heat. Consequently, the surface air temperature changes over
land
occur much faster and are much larger than over the oceans.
Changes in land moisture affect the disposition of heat and
whether it raises the temperature or goes into evaporating
moisture (which subsequently heats the atmosphere when released
during rainfall). The land surface and its ecosystems play an
important role in the exchanges of water vapor and other trace
gases.<P>

Climate can vary from human activities which can lead to changes
in atmospheric composition by altering, for example,
concentrations of carbon dioxide and visible pollution (which
occurs as tiny particulates called aerosols) in the atmosphere.
The amount of carbon dioxide has increased by more than 25
percent in the past century, an increase which is known to be in
part due to combustion of fossil fuels and the removal of
forests. The increased amount of carbon dioxide is leading to
climate change and is expected to produce, on average, a global
warming of the Earth's surface because of its enhanced
greenhouse
effect. Several other greenhouse gases are also increasing in
concentration in the atmosphere from human activities
(especially
biomass burning, landfills, rice paddies, agriculture, animal
husbandry, fossil fuel use and industry), including methane,
nitrous oxide, the chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and tropospheric
ozone, reinforcing the effects from increased carbon dioxide.<P>

Human activities affect the amount of aerosol mainly through
injection of sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere (which also
contributes to acid rain) particularly from power stations and
through biomass burning. The main direct effect of aerosols is
to
block some of the solar radiation, which tends to cool the
Earth's surface. A further influence of aerosols is that many of
them change the way cloud droplets form and can therefore change
the brightness of clouds and thus their reflection of solar
radiation. Aerosols occur in the atmosphere from natural causes
too; for instance, they are blown off the surface of dry regions
or injected into the atmosphere from volcanic eruptions. The
eruption of Mt. Pinatubo in the Philippines in June 1991
produced
a cooling for about two years. Because most aerosols are rained
out of the atmosphere within a few days, they tend to be
concentrated near their sources such as industrial regions.
Their
effects therefore possess a very strong regional pattern. The
presence of aerosols adds complexity to possible climate change
as it can help mask global warming arising from increased
greenhouse gases.<P>

Analysis of observations of surface temperature shows that there
has been a global mean warming of about 0.5 degree Centigrade
over the past one hundred years. An observed trend of a larger
increase in minimum than maximum temperatures is apparently
linked to associated increases in low cloud amount and aerosol
as
well as the enhanced greenhouse effect. There is good evidence
for decadal changes in the atmospheric circulation which
contribute to regional effects, so that not all places warm at
the same rate, and some places have cooled. Changes in
precipitation and other components of the hydrological cycle,
not
unexpectedly, vary considerably geographically. Changes in
climate variability and extremes, especially related to El Nino,
are beginning to emerge.<P>

Changes in climate have occurred in the distant past as the
distribution of continents and their landscapes have changed, as
the orbit of the Earth has varied, and as the composition of the
atmosphere has changed, all through natural processes. Recent
new
evidence from ice cores drilled through the Greenland ice sheet
have indicated that changes in climate may often have been quite
rapid and large, and not associated with any known external
forcings.<P>

The determination of the climatic response to changes in forcing
is complicated by feedbacks. Some of these can amplify the
original warming (positive feedback) while others serve to
reduce
it (negative feedback). An example of the former is water vapor
feedback in which the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere
increases as the Earth warms and, because water vapor is an
important greenhouse gas, it will amplify the warming. However,
increases in cloud may act either to amplify the warming through
the greenhouse effect of clouds or reduce it by reflecting more
solar radiation; which effect dominates depends on the height
and
type of clouds and varies greatly with geographic location and
time of year. Feedbacks from snow and ice may amplify
temperature
changes in high latitudes. To quantify the response of the
climate system it is essential to account for all the complex
interactions and feedbacks, and this is done in computers using
numerical models based upon sound well-established physical
principles. Global climate models include as central components
atmospheric and oceanic general circulation models, as well as
representations of all the other processes. Comprehensive
climate
models are very complex and require large computer resources. To
explore all the possible scenarios and the effects of
assumptions
or approximations in the model more thoroughly, simpler models
are also widely used and are constructed to give similar results
to the climate models when globally averaged.<P>

When a model is employed for climate prediction it is first run
without any changes in external forcing and the quality of the
simulation is assessed by comparing it with observations of the
climate. The model is then run with changes in external forcing,
such as with a possible future profile of greenhouse gas
concentrations. The differences between the climate statistics
in
the two simulations provide an estimate of the accompanying
climate change. The models used in climate projections are still
undergoing development and their capabilities can be expected to
increase in the future. In the meantime, they are valuable tools
for helping to quantify possible outcomes under various
scenarios. They are used with the observations and all the other
evidence to make the best assessments possible.<P>

<B><FONT size=4><A NAME="q2">Why does the ocean appear blue? Is
it because it reflects the color of the sky?</A></B></FONT>
<P>
Thomas F. Gross of the <A
HREF="http://www.skio.peachnet.edu/">Skidaway Institute of
Oceanography</A> in Savannah, Georgia, offered a quick solution to
this one:
"The ocean looks blue because red, orange and yellow (long
wavelength light) are absorbed more strongly by water than is
blue (short wavelength light). So when white light from the sun
enters the ocean, it is mostly the blue that gets returned. Same
reason the sky is blue."
<P>
In other words, the color of the ocean and the color of the sky
are related but occur independently of each other: in both
cases, the preferential absorption of long-wavelength (reddish)
light gives rise to the blue. Note that this effect only works
if the water is very pure; if the water is full of mud, algae or
other impurities, the light scattered off these impurities will
overwhelm the water's natural blueness.
<P>
Gross then asks, "So why are sunsets orange?" 
Several people to wrote in to correct or clarify
that 
comment.<P>

Perhaps the most helpful response came from <A
HREF="http://kasey.umkc.edu/cctr/dept/physics/myinfo.html">Michael
Kruger</A> of the 
department of physics at the University of Missouri. He sent the

following reaction: <P>

"The answer to why the sky is blue isn't quite correct. The sky
is 
blue not because the atmosphere absorbs the other colors, but 
because the atmosphere tends to scatter shorter wavelength
(blue) 
light to a greater extent than longer wavelength (red) light.
Blue light 
from the sun is scattered every which way, much more so than the

other colors, so when you look up at the daytime sky you see
blue no 
matter where you look. This scattering is called 'Rayleigh
scattering'; 
the amount of scattering goes as the frequency of the light to
the 4th 
power. By the way, this effect is most prevalent when the
particles 
that do the scattering are smaller than the wavelength of light,
as is 
the case for the nitrogen and oxygen molecules in the
atmosphere.<P>

"Now we are in a position to figure out why <A
HREF="http://tawny.bu.edu/JandJ/GIFs/USA/C0490016.gif">sunsets</A>
are reddish! 
When the sun is setting, the light that reaches you has had to
go 
through lots more atmosphere than when the sun is overhead,
hence 
the only color light that is <I>not</I> scattered away is the
long 
wavelength light, the red.<P>

"We can also answer why clouds, milk, powdered sugar and salt
are 
white. The particles in these materials that are responsible for

scattering the light are larger than the wavelength of light. 
Consequently, all colors of light are scattered by more or less
the 
same amount. Much of the scattering in milk is due to the lipids
(fat). 
If you take out the fat, the milk will not scatter as much
light; that is 
probably why skim milk looks the way it does."<P>

"What do we know about the origin of the earth's oceans? Is it
more likely that they derive from icy comets that struck the
young earth or from material released from the earth's interior
during volcanic activity?"</A></B></FONT>

<P>-<I>Jacob Martin, Wakefield, West Yorkshire, U.K.</I>

<P>Tobias C. Owen of the <A HREF="http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/faculty/"> Institute for
Astronomy</A> in Honolulu, Hawaii, offers this overview:

<P>"This is a very good question, because we do not yet have an
answer that everyone accepts.

<P>"The origin of the oceans goes back to the time of the earth's
formation 4. 6 billion years ago, when our planet was forming
through the accumulation of smaller objects, called <A
HREF="http://funky.tamu.edu/collide.htm"> planetesimals</A>.
There are basically three possible sources for the water. It
could have (1) separated out from the rocks that make up the
bulk of the earth; (2) arrived as part of a late-accreting
veneer of water- rich meteorites, similar to the carbonaceous
chondrites that we see today; or (3) arrived as part of a
late-accreting veneer of icy planetesimals, that is, <A
HREF="http://bang.lanl.gov/solarsys/comet.htm">comets</A>.

<P>"The composition of the ocean offers some clues as to its
origin. If all the comets contain the same kind of water ice
that we have examined in Comets <A
HREF="http://bang.lanl.gov/solarsys/halley.htm">Halley</A> and
<A
HREF="http://NewProducts.jpl.nasa.gov/comet/hyakutake/">Hyakutake</A>-
-the only ones whose water molecules we've been able to study in
detail-- then comets cannot have delivered all the water in the
earth's oceans. We know this because the ice in the comets
contains twice as many atoms of deuterium (a heavy isotope of
hydrogen) to each atom of ordinary hydrogen as we find in
seawater.

<P>"At the same time, we know that the meteorites could not have
delivered all of the water, because then the earth's atmosphere
would contain nearly 10 times as much xenon (an inert gas) as it
actually does. Meteorites all carry this excess xenon. Nobody
has yet measured the concentration of xenon in comets, but
recent laboratory experiments on the trapping of gases by ice
forming at low temperatures suggest that comets do not contain
high concentrations of the xenon. A mixture of meteoritic water
and cometary water would not work either, because this
combination would still contain a higher concentration of 
deuterium than is found in the oceans.

<P>"Hence, the best model for the source of the oceans at the
moment is a combination of water derived from comets and water
that was caught up in the rocky body of the earth as it formed.
This mixture satisfies the xenon problem. It also appears to
solve the deuterium problem--but only if the rocky material out
near the earth's present orbit picked up some local water from
the solar nebula (the cloud of gas and dust surrounding the
young sun) before they accreted to form the earth. Some new
laboratory studies of the manner in which deuterium gets
exchanged between hydrogen gas and water vapor have indicated
that the water vapor in the local region of the solar nebula
would have had about the right (low) proportion of deuterium to
balance the excess deuterium seen in comets.

<P>"The point to emphasize here is that this is a model, a working
hypothesis that must be rigorously tested by many additional
measurements. We need to study more comets. We also need to
learn more about the water on Mars, where we have another chance
to investigate the sources described above. On the earth, plate
tectonics has caused oceanic water to mix considerably with
material from the planet's interior; such contamination probably
did not occur on Mars, where plate tectonics does not seem to
occur. These investigations (and other related studies) are
currently under way. This is an active area of research!"

<P><A HREF="http://www.geo.lsa.umich.edu/facs/jcgw.html">James C.
G. Walker</A> of the University of Michigan confirms that
conclusion, adding his perspective:

<P>"The best current thinking is that volatiles (elements and
compounds, including water, that vaporize at low temperatures)
were released from the solid phase as the earth accreted. Thus,
the earth and its oceans and atmosphere grew together.

<P>"During accretion, the kinetic energy of the colliding
planetesimals was converted into thermal energy, so <A
HREF="http://zebu.uoregon.edu/~
imamura/121/nov8/accretion.html">the earth grew extremely
hot</A> as it came together. The material forming the earth was
probably too hot for ice to have been a major carrier of water.
Most of the water was probably present originally as water
trapped in clay minerals or as separate hydrogen (in
hydrocarbons) and oxygen (in iron oxides), rather than as ice.


<P>"Since the end of the period of accretion, more than four
billion years ago, there has been a continual exchange of
volatile material--including water--between the surface of the
earth and the planet's interior (that is, between the crust and
the mantle). Volcanoes release water and carbon dioxide to the
atmosphere and ocean. Subduction of sediments rich in volatiles
takes place at deep ocean trenches. The sinking of oceanic crust
at subduction zones carries water and carbon dioxide back into
the mantle. These processes can all be seen at work today.

<P>"In short, icy cometary material probably has not been important
in providing water for the earth's oceans, but there is little
sure knowledge in this field."

"What ever happened to the theory of periodic mass extinctions,

years? Is it widely accepted? And when was the last such
extinction--have there really been two of them since the
dinosaurs died off 65 million years ago?"</A></B></FONT>

<P>-<I>Michael Jay Tucker, Winchester, Mass.</I>

<P><A HREF="http://www.uky.edu/ArtsSciences/Geology/ettensohn.html" TARGET="_top">Frank
R. Ettensohn</A> in the department of geological sciences at the
University of Kentucky offers this response, which probably
captures the view of many in the scientific community:<P>

"The idea of periodic extinctions is still with us, but it
remains in limbo, still awaiting full proof. Most scientists are
unconvinced. There certainly are <A
HREF="http://superior.carleton.ca/~tpatters/Museum/extinction/extincmenu.html" TARGET="_top">series
of extinctions</A> of varying severity that seem to occur with a
periodicity of 26 to 34 million years. The inferred period is
obviously inexact; some researchers consider this uncertainty a
detraction from the theory, but when you are dealing with such a
large time range, a few million years of error is not that big a
deal.<P>

"The biggest question is what could cause periodic extinctions.
Those who support the theory of periodic extinctions commonly
attribute these events to periodic influxes of meteorites. The
most famous mass extinction--the <A
HREF="http://george.arc.nasa.gov/sst/main.html" TARGET="_top">Cretaceous-Tertiary
event</A>, which marked the end of the dinosaurs--is certainly
related to a meteorite impact, and impacts appear to be possibly
implicated in a few other extinctions. But there is no widely
accepted mechanism that would explain periodic episodes of
impacts, so the idea has floundered for want of proof and of
viable causes.<P>

"The theory of episodic extinctions is an interesting one, and
there are some tantalizing suggestions of what might cause them.
Nothing has really panned out yet, however, so most scientists
remain skeptical."<P>

<A
HREF="http://geosci.uchicago.edu/Faculty/SEPKOSKI/sepkoski.html" TARGET="_top">J.
John Sepkoski, Jr.</A>, is a professor of paleontology at the
University of Chicago; he is also one of the co-discoverers of
the apparent cyclic nature of mass extinctions. Here is his take
on the status of his controversial idea:<P>

"The question of a 26-million-year periodicity of extinction
generated considerable interest in the 1980s. David Raup, now
professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, and I arrived
at this hypothesis empirically, based on our statistical
analysis of data from the fossil record. The best information on
extinction rates comes from a compilation of 36,000 marine
animal genera from the past 600 million years. I continue to
update and improve this compilation.<P>

"The fossils show a statistical variation in extinction rates
having a period of approximately 26 million years. The two
periodic peaks of extinction after the Cretaceous-Tertiary
boundary, 65 million years ago, are at the end of the Eocene
(roughly 37 million years ago) and in the Middle Miocene (about
17 million years ago).<P>

"Raup and I had initially performed a coarser analysis of the
fossil record, focusing on extinctions at the family level (one
level above genus in the taxonomic hierarchy). That analysis
conformed to a 26-million-year periodic series, but it was
missing two beats: one in the late Middle Jurassic (170 million
years ago) and one in the Early Cretaceous (95 million years
ago). Our hypothesis predicted that more extensive data offering
finer time resolution would reveal that small extinction events
occurred at those times. Indeed, the better, more voluminous
genus-level data subsequently confirmed the prediction.<P>

"Why has interest in this hypothesis subsided? There are two
reasons. First, there are statistical questions about extinction
rates that just cannot be answered. It is not clear whether
other hypotheses can fit the empirical data as well as does the
hypothesis of periodicity. The distribution of extinction events
in time is certainly not random, but there is more than one way
to analyze the data. Does the fact that the data appear to fit
well to a model of periodicity mean that the events truly are
periodic? This question was debated throughout the late 1980s
without reaching a resolution.<P>

"The second reason for the loss of interest is one not uncommon
to science: Here is an intriguing observation that no one knows
how to explain. Researchers formulated a number of very
interesting astronomical hypotheses to account for the
26-million-year periodicity of extinction. The most famous of
these was the <A
HREF="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/billa/tnp/hypo.html#nemesis" TARGET="_top">Nemesis</A>,
or 'death star,' hypothesis, which stated that the sun has a
distant companion whose highly elliptical orbit brings it into
the <A
HREF="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/kboc.html" TARGET="_top">Oort
Cloud</A> (a swarm of frozen comets orbiting far from the sun)
once every 26 million years. During each pass through the Oort
Cloud, the companion's gravity would scatter huge numbers of
comets, some of which would crash into Earth. The environmental
damage caused by these impacts would lead to an elevated rate of
extinctions.<P>

"Nemesis has not been found, although <A
HREF="http://theor1.lbl.gov/www/astro/nemesis/lbl-hp.htm" TARGET="_top">Richard
A. Muller</A> of the University of California at Berkeley
continues to track dim red stars to discover if one of them
might be a companion to the sun. Also, evidence of impact (such
as iridium-rich clay layers or widespread shocked minerals) has
not been found in association with all the major extinctions, as
would be predicted by the hypothesis. There is excess iridium at
the end-Triassic (208 million years ago) and Late Eocene events,
as would be expected if impact occurred then, but no such
evidence is seen at other events in the periodic series that
have been studied in detail.<P>

"Hence, we have an empirical observation of periodicity but no
new hypotheses that suggest interesting tests. This situation is
not conducive to scientific effort or to intellectual curiosity,
so interest in the question of periodic extinctions has died
down. But not completely: there is an interesting scientific
paper on the problem published by M. R. Rampino and B. M.
Haggerty in <I>Earth, Moon, and Planets</I> (Vol. 72, Nos. 1-3,
pages 441-460; 1996), entitled "The 'Shiva Hypothesis': Impacts,
Mass Extinctions, and the Galaxy."<P>

Finally, <A
HREF="http://www.cc.rochester.edu/College/GEO/brett.htm" TARGET="_top">Carlton
E. Brett</A> in the department of earth and environmental
sciences at the University of Rochester adds his point of view
on this controversy:<P>

"Raup and Sepkoski were onto something quite significant,
although perhaps not in the specific formulation they presented.
I am strongly convinced of one very important implication of
Raup and Sepkoski's 'worldview,' that is, that episodic crises
have been crucial to evolution. Indeed, one might argue that
relatively little evolutionary change would have taken place in
life's history without such events. Raup and Sepkoski did make
that argument, and so do I, albeit from a different and more
detailed perspective.<P>

"My main slant on this issue stems from more than two decades of
intensive field study of marine animal fossil assemblages from
the Silurian and Devonian (about 438 to 375 million years ago)
of eastern North America. The pattern that emerges here--and in
at least some other intervals--is that there are more numerous
but less regular extinction events spaced a few million years
(in the range of one to about 10 million years) apart. These
events have strongly shaped the course of life.<P>

"I recently proposed that one important pattern in the history
of life is what I term 'coordinated stasis.' This hypothesis,
related to but broader than the concept of punctuated
equilibrium, suggests that very little evolution is going on
during most of geologic time and that most lineages do not
effectively speciate (split into two or more species) or undergo
much within-lineage change for periods of several million years.
Moreover, the structure of biofacies or communities remains
fairly similar for vast spans of time, represented by these one-
to 10-million-year blocks of stability. But at the ends of these
intervals, fairly radical changes occur (for instance, local
extinction of up to 80 percent of lineages, speciation,
immigration or ecological restructuring). These changes appear
to have been relatively rapid: periods of instability and
restructuring last a few thousand to at most a few hundred
thousand years, as compared with millions of years of near
stability.<P>

"The events that triggered such major biological turnovers
remain for the most part obscure, but we are going back to the
geologic record to try and sleuth out correlations that may
indicate causal factors. Rapid climatic change and major
sea-level fluctuation seem the most plausible triggers. Such
events occurred fairly regularly in geologic time, a pattern
reflected in the rather similar durations of the geologic stages
long recognized by scientists; the divisions of geologic time
are usually defined by notable change in the fossil record.
Without these crises there would be little evolutionary change;
one might argue that extinctions are necessary to open
opportunities for new evolution.<P>

"Thus, some studies support an episodic or punctuational view of
life as a whole (as opposed to punctuated equilibrium, which
considers change associated with speciation in just one lineage
at a time) and emphasize the importance of the rare crises, as
did Sepkoski and Raup. Detailed evidence does not necessarily
favor a regular or periodic history of evolution, however, and
certainly not one divided into simple 26-million-year
increments.<P>

"Overall, scientists have found little evidence that
extraterrestrial impacts coincided with most of the major and
minor extinctions, the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary being a
major exception. There are a few other hints of other impacts
associated with extinctions in the geologic record, but most of
these are poorly substantiated or very localized and there are
many extinction events that do not correlate with any evidence
of impact. Likewise, there are many records of impact (craters,
for instance) that seem to have produced little or no biotic
effect. So the search for a single common cause to all
biological crises has come up rather empty."<P>

"Why do regular, wavelike shapes form when the wind blows over the sand on
the beach for a long time? And what determines the spacing (frequency) of
these waves?"</A></B></FONT>

<P>-<I>Michael Taal, Amsterdam, Netherlands</I>

<P><A HREF="http://www.erc.ufl.edu/tl/hanes.html">Daniel M. Hanes</A> in the
department of coastal and oceanographic engineering at the University of
Florida, Gainesville, answers:

<P>"The waves you ask about are just one example of so-called bedforms that
occur when a fluid flows over loose sedimentary material. They occur all
over the world under many different conditions and produce a magnificent
variety of shapes and patterns. Some of them remain stationary, such as
the diamond-shaped patterns sometimes seen on a dry beach. Others, such as
sand dunes in the desert, move in the direction of the prevailing wind or
current. 

<P>"There are several possible mechanisms leading to the particular bedforms,
and this is an area of legitimate scientific controversy. The most
accepted explanation is that the flow of the overlying fluid (water or
air) interacts with the moving sediment grains in a manner that results in
a stable shape, or bedform. The specific shape therefore depends on the
density and viscosity of the fluid, its speed above the sand and the
nature of the sediment (that is, its characteristic size, shape and
density). 

<P>"Some of the interesting early observations and explanations of bedform
patterns are provided by Ralph A. Bagnold in his book <I>The Physics of
Blown Sand and Desert Dunes</I> (<A
HREF="http://zelda.thomson.com/chaphall/default.html">Chapman and
Hall</A>, 1984 [reprint of 1941 edition])."

<P><A HREF="http://glass.ucsc.edu/~rsand/">Robert S. Anderson</A>, associate
professor of earth sciences at the University of California at Santa Cruz,
provides a more thorough overview of this deceptively complicated
phenomenon:

<P>"Ripples in sand, found on both beaches and dunes, are one of nature's
most ubiquitous and spectacular examples of self-organization. They do not
result from some predetermined pattern in the wind that is somehow
impressed on the surface, but rather from the dynamics of individual
grains in motion across the surface. They arise whenever wind blows
strongly enough over a sand surface to entrain grains into the wind. The
subsequent hopping and leaping of these grains is called saltation.
Saltating grains travel elongated, asymmetric trajectories: Rising
relatively steeply off the bed, their path is then stretched downwind as
they are accelerated by drag forces. They impact the sand surface
centimeters to tens of centimeters downwind, typically at a low angle,
around 10 degrees. It is this beam of wind-accelerated grains impacting
the sand surface at a low angle that is responsible for ripples.

<P>"An artificially flattened sand surface will not remain flat for long.
(Try it on the beach or on the upwind side of a dune and see for
yourself.) Small irregular mottles in the sand surface, perhaps a couple
centimeters in wavelength, rapidly arise and grow once the wind starts to
blow hard enough to initiate saltation. They then slowly organize
themselves into more regular waves whose low crests are aligned
perpendicular to the wind direction and begin to march slowly downwind.
Typical ripple spacing is about 10 centimeters, whereas the typical height
of the crests above the troughs is a few millimeters. The pattern is never
perfect, but instead the ripple crests occasionally split or terminate,
generating a pattern that looks remarkably like one's fingerprint. In
cross section, the ripples are asymmetric, having low-angle upwind (stoss)
faces and steeper downwind (lee) faces. Interestingly, the larger grains
tend to accumulate on the crests of the ripples, leaving the troughs
enriched in smaller grains.

<P>"How does a low-angle beam of impacting saltating grains result in such
downwind-marching waves of sand? This topographic pattern arises from a
spatial pattern of deposition and erosion on the sand surface. In order to
march downwind, deposition must be occurring on the downwind faces of the
ripples, and erosion must be occurring on the upwind faces. Erosion occurs
where there are more grains leaving the surface than are arriving, and
deposition occurs where more grains are arriving than are leaving. Once
saltation is well under way, by far the majority of grains in motion are
actually blasted off the sand surface by the impacts of other saltating
grains, rather than being carried along directly by fluid forces of the
wind. And whereas the grains of sand that hit your ankles or accumulate in
your pants cuffs travel long trajectories, most of the grains in motion
are traveling in very short hops, only a few millimeters in length. The
few grains traveling in long trajectories impact the sand surface with
sufficient energy to force a large number of sand grains to hop. 

<P>"So, what sets the pattern of deposition and erosion? Because of their
low-impact angle, the intensity of the bombardment by energetic, long
trajectories is highest on the upwind sides of ripples. This results in
many more grains being launched off from the stoss surface than are
landing there, causing erosion. Conversely, the lee of the ripple is
inclined so steeply that it does not get bombarded; the crest of the
ripple in essence shields the lee face from bombardment. The lee face
therefore becomes a zone of net accumulation; the many grains blasted from
the upwind face and crest of the ripple land here, while few grains are
blasted from the surface. This process explains why even small initial
bumps in the sand surface will grow and why ripples move downwind.

<P>"And what controls the wavelength? Indirectly, the wind speed, in the
following way. The wind speed determines the impact angle of the longer
trajectories: the greater the wind speed, the more the saltation
trajectories are stretched out, and the lower the resulting impact angles.
A lower-impact angle results in a longer bombardment shadow behind each
ripple crest and hence a longer wavelength. 

<P>"This is a long-winded answer, perhaps, but one I that hope helps others
to understand these wonderful patterns in nature."

<P>Walt Hoagman, a Sea Grant educator at the Michigan State University
Extension in northeast Michigan on the shores of Lake Huron, fills in some
concrete details:

<P>"Regular, wavelike ridges on a beach are called sand ripples or ripple
marks. A ripple is simply a small wave, having a period of three seconds
or less. Sand ripples, however, do not have easily discernible periods
(they do have periods, but they are on the order of days). Wind velocities
of three to 15 kilometers per hour will produce water waves having periods
up to three seconds. The maximum size of a fully developed water wave in a
15 kilometer-per-hour wind is 0.55 meter, and the average size is around
.30 meter (one foot). Most water ripples are much smaller, however, coming
from the more common winds that blow at between three and 11 kilometers
per hour.

<P>"Water waves are fairly easy to understand. They arise when pressure from
the wind starts a pressure hump, which passes on its energy to adjacent
water molecules in the direction of the wind. As the wind speed increases,
the waves become regular and 'march' along the surface at predictable
speeds and with predictable heights. Water waves away from shore become
unstable when the wind speed exceeds 1.3 times the waves' speed. At that
point, they begin to get steep and begin to break forward, producing
whitecaps. The upwind slope then becomes shallower (flatter) than the
downwind slope. The higher the wind in relation to the wave speed, the
steeper the waves get, especially on the downwind side.

<P>"Wind over sand behaves somewhat differently, but some of the same basic
forces are at work to create regular spaced ripples. Because sand does not
transmit energy to adjacent sand particles when wind blows over it, the
wind must rise over a stationary hump. In so doing, it is compressed
vertically, so it must speed up. The top of the hump (sand wave) and the
windward slope get the greatest velocity. The valley between (where the
wind can expand again) has the slowest wind; a rolling vortex, which acts
as a vacuum to lift sand from the valley, arises there. A wind, or the
wash along a shore, must be prolonged and continuous from one direction in
order for sand ripples to form. In the Great Lakes region, sand ripples
are best seen or felt underwater. They are fairly rare on the dry beach
around here, probably because the local winds are very erratic and the
sand is less sticky than ocean sand.

<P>"The frequency of any wave formation is determined by the overall strength
of the wind or, in the case of sand ripples underwater, by the strength of
the waves. With dry sand, a strong wind begins to wipe out ripples and
make larger and regular berms, spaced fairly evenly perpendicular to the
wind. These are in reality large ripples. Continued, strong winds can
change these rises into undulating dunes that often go far inland."

significance of the recent report that the earth's solid core rotates slightly
faster than the earth's surface. Is this a cause or an effect of the earth's
magnetic field? Does the slowing of the earth because of the moon's gravity also
contribute to the phenomenon?</A></B></FONT>

<P><I>-John Kilty, Portland, Ore.</I>

<P>Gary A. Glatzmaier of the <A
HREF="http://ees-www.lanl.gov/IGPP/IGPP.html">Institute of Geophysics & Planetary
Physics</A> at Los Alamos National Laboratory is one of the pioneers in modeling
the earth's core. He provides this response:

<P> "As reported in their July 18 article in <A
HREF="http://www.nature.com">Nature</A>, <A
HREF="http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/song/song.html">Xiaodong Song</A> and <A
HREF="http://imager.ldeo.columbia.edu/geol_sci/html/paul_richards.html">Paul G.
Richards</A> of <A
HREF="http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/song/lamont-story.html">Lamont-Doherty Earth
Observatory</A> find evidence that the inner core rotates slightly faster than
the surface and outer layers of the earth. They were led to look for this effect
by a prediction of it published last year by myself and Paul H. Roberts of the
University of California at Los Angeles.

<P>"In our geodynamo model, the magnetic field is generated by convection in the
fluid outer core and by local shears in the fluid flow that develop just above
the solid inner core because of its rotation rate. The magnetic field permeates
both the outer and inner cores, however, so the inner and outer cores are
magnetically coupled to each other. The inner core in our simulation is thus
forced to rotate at some average of the rate of the eastward fluid flows (jet
streams) in the outer core that carry along the magnetic field. This co-rotation
rate (between the inner core and the jet streams in the other core) settles at
whatever value will result in a zero net torque on the inner core. If the
rotation rate of the inner core changed for some reason, there would develop a
huge net magnetic torque that would quickly restore it to the co-rotation rate.

<P>"This effect that Roberts and I found in our simulation is analogous to the
way in which a synchronous electric motor works, with the inner core acting like
the rotor. The jet streams in the fluid outer core result from thermal and
compositional buoyancy forces, Coriolis forces, pressure gradients and magnetic
Lorentz forces. Hence, the super-rotation of the inner core is really neither a
pure cause nor a pure effect of the magnetic field. The situation is much more
intricate: the inner core rotation, the fluid flow, the magnetic field, and the
thermal and compositional distributions all have complicated nonlinear feedbacks
on one another, which is why solving this problem required running a
three-dimensional model on a supercomputer.

<P>"Of course, all these statements depend on how well the computer model
simulates the real earth. The magnetic field produced in the Glatzmaier-Roberts
model, measured at the surface, is quite similar in strength, structure and time
dependence to the earth's actual field. Note that less than 1 percent of the
total magnetic energy of the simulated field exists outside the core. The
magnetic energy in the inner core is only about 10 percent of the magnetic energy
in the outer core (where the field is generated), but it is about 100 times
greater than the kinetic energy resulting from the rotation of the inner core
relative to the rest of the earth. Therefore, there should be plenty of magnetic
energy available to keep the inner core rotating in step with the average fluid
flow just above the inner core; this flow is eastward, which is why the inner
core is rotating faster than the earth's mantle and crust outside the core.

<P>"Viscous forces in the fluid core are extremely small relative to the magnetic
forces. As a result, even though the earth's overall rotation is slowing because
of the gravitational pull of the moon, viscous forces in the fluid probably have
very little effect on the rotation rate of the inner core. On the other hand, the
precession of the earth's rotation axis resulting from the sun and moon (the
precession of the equinoxes) may produce additional forces that drive the fluid
flow in the core and thereby influence the generation of the magnetic field and
the rotation of the inner core."

<P>Philip N. Froelich, the director of the School of Earth and Atmospheric
Sciences at the Georgia Institute of Technology, offers more of an outsider's
perspective:

<P>"The seismic evidence presented by Song and Richards strongly indicates that
the solid inner core is moving with respect to the outer crust of the earth. This
evidence is based on the observation that the axis of fastest sound (seismic)
velocity through the solid inner core--which is angled about 10 degrees from the
earth's spin axis--is moving eastward at about one degree a year. Seismic waves
move faster through the core in the north-south direction than in the equatorial
direction probably because of the preferential orientation of iron crystals in
the inner core; they all seem lined up in one direction. It is not known,
however, why this direction is offset by 10 degrees from the present rotation
axis. (Perhaps most of the inner core's iron crystallized when the earth's spin
axis was slightly different.)

<P>"In any event, Song and Richards's measurements take advantage of this offset.
The simplest (but not only) explanation of their observed movement of the inner
core is that the inner core's rate of spin is slightly faster than the earth's
crust and mantle. The evidence presented so far, however, is not a direct
measurement of the inner core's rate of rotation, nor does this evidence require
that the inner core's spin axis be different from the earth's spin axis (it is
probably the same).

<P>"The reasons for this inferred differential spin are not yet known; they may
or may not be caused by the earth's magnetic field. Purely physical factors, such
as the slowing of the outer part of the earth resulting from tidal friction
between the earth's oceans and the moon, might suffice. I suspect that if you ask
100 geophysicists this question you will get 99 different answers, and at least
one of them will turn out to be right! A lot of folks are right now sitting down
to rework the torque balances for an inner sphere rotating inside a fluid nearly
frictionless rotating frame of reference."

<P>[We note that Glatzmaier's answer would seem to rule out this lunar
explanation--but as Froelich observes, there is still much uncertainty in our
understanding of the earth's inner core.]

<FONT size=4><B><A NAME="g1"> Why are impact craters always
round? Most incoming objects must strike at some angle from vertical, so why
don't the majority of impact sites have elongated, teardrop
shapes?</A></B></FONT><P>

<P><I>-Richard Schroeder, Dallas, Tex.</I>

<P><A HREF="http://www.physics.hmc.edu/profs/lyzenga.html">Gregory A.
Lyzenga</A>, associate professor of physics at Harvey Mudd College, replies:

<P>"When geologists and astronomers first recognized that lunar and terrestrial
craters were produced by impacts, they surmised that much of the impacting body
might be found still buried beneath the surface of the crater floor. (Much wasted
effort was expended to locate a huge, buried nickel-iron meteorite believed to
rest under the famous <A
HREF="http://128.165.1.1/solarsys/raw/earth/meteor.jpg">Barringer meteor
crater</A> near Winslow, Ariz.) Much later, however, scientists realized that at
typical solar system velocities--several to tens of kilometers per second--any
impacting body must be completely vaporized when it hits.

<P>"At the moment an asteroid collides with a planet, there is an explosive
release of the asteroid's huge kinetic energy. The energy is very abruptly
deposited at what amounts to a single point in the planet's crust. This sudden,
focused release resembles more than anything else the detonation of an extremely
powerful bomb. As in the case of a bomb explosion, the shape of the resulting
crater is round: ejecta is thrown equally in all directions regardless of the
direction from which the bomb may have arrived.

<P>"This behavior may seem at odds with our daily experience of throwing rocks
into a sandbox or mud, because in those cases the shape and size of the 'crater'
is dominated by the physical dimensions of the rigid impactor. In the case of
astronomical impacts, though, the physical shape and direction of approach of the
meteorite is insignificant compared with the tremendous kinetic energy that it
carries.

<P>"An exception to this rule occurs only if the impact occurs at an extremely
shallow, grazing angle. If the angle of impact is quite close to horizontal, the
bottom, middle and top parts of the impacting asteroid will strike the surface at
separate points spread out along a line. In this case, instead of the energy
being deposited at a point, it will be released in an elongated zone--as if our
'bomb' had the shape of a long rod.

<P>"Hence, a crater will end up having an elongated or elliptical appearance only
if the angle of impact is so shallow that different parts of the impactor strike
the surface over a range of distances that is appreciable in comparison with the
final size of the crater as a whole. Because the final crater may be as much as
100 times greater than the diameter of the impactor, this requires an impact at
an angle of no more than a few degrees from horizontal. For this reason, the vast
majority of impacts produce round or nearly round craters, just as is observed."

<P><A
HREF="http://cil.andrew.cmu.edu/projects/brochure/herbert_simon.html">Herbert
A. Simon</A>, professor of psychology at Carnegie Mellon University in
Pittsburgh, responds:
<P>"I have followed the development of chaos theory with some interest over the
past decade or so, but without direct active involvement, so I may or may
not be a reliable witness. The only serious efforts of which I am aware to
apply chaos theory to social phenomena have been in economics--possibly
because only in economics does one find the kinds of time-series data that
would be required to test whether or not phenomena are chaotic. There have
been a number of such tests for economic data--although even for economic
phenomena, time series of the length and accuracy needed for testing are
hard to come by, except in the case of some kinds of monetary series and
series of stock prices. The verdict would seem to be that there is some
indication of chaos in some of the series that have been examined. If that
conclusion sounds vague, it is because the evidence looks vague to me.
<P>"As a consequence, I would hesitate to say that chaos theory has had any
major impact on the social sciences to date, although the idea that economic
trends are difficult to forecast because they are chaotic remains an
attractive one. There could be lots of other reasons for our inability to
predict, however, all of which would have the same practical consequences.
<P>"In psychology, where most of my own research resides, I have observed
nothing of importance that relates to chaos, and I would be rather
astonished if it plays any significant role in behavior extending over tens
of milliseconds or longer--that is, the kind of behavior we observe and
explain in most psychological experiments. But then, astonishment is what we
are always seeking in good science, isn't it?"
<P><A HREF="http://www.santafe.edu/~jpc">James P. Crutchfield</A>, research
professor at the Sante Fe Institute and a research physicist at the
University of California at Berkeley, adds a small plea:
<P>"The phrase 'chaos theory' was invented, as far as I can tell, by the
science press around the time of the publication of James Gleick's book
<I>Chaos</I>. The proper descriptor, for better or for worse, is 'dynamical
systems theory.' I hope I can disabuse people of using the popularized term,

<P>-<I>V. Vitols, Anaheim Hills, Calif.</I>
<P><A HREF="http://www.math.nwu.edu/~d_saari">Donald G. Saari</A> from the
department of mathematics at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill.,
gives this overview of voting behavior:
<P>"After two centuries of efforts by mathematicians and political scientists,
positive results about 'fair voting procedures' are emerging. This is
important because 'fairness' can be a casualty when current methods are used
in multiple-candidate elections--such as this year's presidential campaign.
<P>"To illustrate, suppose that 200 voters prefer Alice to Candy to Becky
(denoted by Alice &gt; Candy &gt; Becky), 195 prefer Becky &gt; Candy &gt; Alice,
whereas only 20 prefer Candy &gt; Becky &gt; Alice. The plurality election
outcome, where we vote for our top-ranked candidate, is Alice &gt; Becky &gt;
Candy with a 200:195:20 tally. While we might worry whether these voters
prefer Alice or Becky, Candy's feeble support suggests that she is of no
interest to these voters.
<P>"This assertion, however, is false. If we compare candidates in pairs, it
becomes arguable that Candy is their favorite. These voters prefer Candy to
Alice (215 to 200), Candy to Becky (220 to 195), and Becky to Alice (215 to
200); these rankings suggest that these voters actually prefer Candy &gt; Becky
&gt; Alice. Notice how this outcome conflicts with and reverses the plurality
ranking. Moreover, it shows that Candy's lack of votes more accurately
manifests inadequacies of our commonly used election procedure rather than
voter disinterest. The example also shows that, inadvertently, we can choose
badly. 
<P>"To explain the flaw of the plurality vote, imagine parental reaction should
a local school suddenly decide to rank students strictly by the number of
A's they receive. The unfairness of this method is obvious; it ranks a
student with 3 A's and failures in all other classes above the student with
2 A's and the rest B's. Not only is this flawed procedure equivalent to the
plurality vote (by using only top-ranked choices), but it also explains the
above example. This is because, like the student with many B's, Candy has
the enviable status of being either top- or second-ranked by all voters.
Alice, on the other hand, is top-ranked by some voters but viewed a failure
by over half of them. If common sense forces us to reject this plurality
system when ranking students, why should we embrace this flawed approach
when making critical decisions or choosing leaders?
<P>"Our widely used plurality method should be replaced--but with what? While
some improvement is attained with a runoff election, it has problems. In the
example, for instance, Becky wins the runoff (between Alice and Becky), so
this procedure avoids selecting Alice. Candy, who appears to be the voters'
favorite, is dropped at the first stage, however. Let us consider another
method, in which voters have one nontransferable vote per candidate--they
vote either yes or no for each candidate. Rather than being fair, this
procedure admits almost random conclusions. 
<P>In our sample three-person race,
for instance, an election could easily produce any ranking of the
candidates. Just by varying choices about which voters also vote for their
second-ranked candidate, we can obtain either of the two earlier outcomes,
or one in which Becky wins and Alice and Candy are tied, or one in which all
candidates are tied, or... The source of this chaotic situation is easy to
understand by changing the grading analogy to one in which students are
ranked according to the number of A's, or the number of A's and B's, or the
number of A's, B's and C's, or... In these rules, there is no distinction
among grades (so, an A can be judged equivalent to a C or D), and the choice
of what grades are included in the count can vary from course to course.
Clearly, we must anticipate indecisive chaotic outcomes.
<P>"As this one example illustrates, determining 'fair' voting procedures is a
complex issue. The problem is that whereas philosophical arguments promoting
certain procedures may sound convincing, subtle higher-dimensional
mathematical aspects can reveal a host of unexpected complications. Can the
system be manipulated? What happens if new candidates enter (such as Pat
Buchanan in the primaries or Ross Perot during the fall campaign) or drop
out of contention (such as Steven Forbes during the primaries)? Which method
most accurately captures the voters' true intentions? Surprisingly,
mathematics is proving that only one method satisfies most of these
criteria: the Borda Count, named after its founder, the 18-century French
mathematician Jean-Charles de Borda.
<P>"Although the supporting mathematics is complex, the Borda Count admits an
intuitive description. The idea mimicks how we rank students when in each
course a student is assigned four points for an A, three for a B, and down
to zero for a F. Similarly, for three candidates, the Borda Count assigns
two and one points, respectively, to a voter's top- and second-ranked
candidate. The Borda Count makes a difference as shown by the example
whereby it yields the acceptable Candy &gt; Becky &gt; Alice election ranking,
with a 435:410:400 tally. 
<P>"To see how the Borda Count captures the 'one man, one vote' philosophy,
notice that a voter having the preferences Alice &gt; Becky &gt; Candy would vote
for Alice in both the [Alice vs. Becky] and the [Alice vs. Candy] pairwise
elections and for Becky in the [Becky vs. Candy] election. In these
elections, then, he gives two points to Alice and one to Becky--point totals
that agree with the Borda Count tally of his ballot. In other words, the
Borda Count is the natural extension of what we do in a two-person race; it
is an efficient way to compute each voter's 'one man, one vote' actions over
pairs of candidates. Indeed, both in pragmatic and theoretical senses, it
can be (and has been) proved that only the Borda Count appears to achieve
the elusive 'fairness' goal for elections.

<P>"The mathematically more sophisticated reader, who would like to explore the
connections of voting with dynamical chaos and statistical paradoxes, might want
to read the article 'A Chaotic Exploration of Aggregation Paradoxes,' by D.
G. Saari in <A HREF="http://www.siam.org/journals/sirev/sirev.htm"><I>SIAM
Review,</I></A> Vol. 37, No. 1; March 1995."
<P>Lawrence Ford, the chair of the <A HREF="http://math.isu.edu/">mathematics
department</A> at Idaho State University, notes that the goal of fairness is
more elusive than it may appear:
<P>"There has been lots of activity over the past 30 to 40 years on
mathematical applications in political science. One problem that has been
studied extensively seems similar to the problem you describe: Given a set
of candidates (at least 3) and a number of voters, select the 'fairest'
winner.
<P>"Many solutions have been proposed, but all were shown to exhibit flaws in
some cases. Then, in the early 1960s, <A
HREF="http://www-econ.stanford.edu/econ/faculty/arrow.html">Kenneth
Arrow</A> proved his famous <A
HREF="http://cisr.anu.edu.au/arp/guy/appendixarrowsimpossib_431.html">Impossibility
Theorem</A>, which essentially states that no system can exist without these
flaws, that is, no perfect voting system exists. So 'fairer' is a subjective
measure; any voting system can be made to look 'unfair' under the right set
of circumstances.
<P>Voting systems such as the one you describe are probably very susceptible to
'strategic voting,' wherein participants can influence the outcome by
insincere voting. A similar system that is not susceptible to strategic
voting and that is gaining a good reputation as a relatively fair system is
'approval voting.' In it, a voter votes for all candidates he or she
approves of. The candidate with the most votes wins. In it, the candidate
with the broadest approval base wins (centrists, not extremists, get
elected--which is often not the case in a one person/one vote election). One
big flaw here is that most voters are fairly positive of their favorites and
fairly positive of those they hate, but wishy-washy in the middle. If they
choose randomly for or against approval in that middle range, the whole
election can become random."
<P><A HREF="http://www.wilkes.edu/wilkesdocs/ssedocs/M-S.html#merrill">Sam
Merrill</A> in the department of mathematics and computer science at Wilkes
University in Wilkes-Barre, Penn., provides more details:
<P>"The method of voting in multicandidate elections referred to in the
question is, I believe, approval voting. Under this procedure, each voter
can vote for one, two, three or any number of candidates. In effect, the
voter considers each candidate one by one and casts a vote for those whom 
she (or he) approves but not for those whom she does not approve. The winner
is the one approved by the most voters.
<P>"Approval voting is now used by several national and international
professional societies in their election of officers. These include the
Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, the American Statistical
Association, the Mathematical Association of America and the Institute for
Management Science. Some of the approval-voting elections in these societies
have led to winners who would not have won under single-vote plurality (the
more common method used in the U.S.) or have enhanced the standing in the
voting outcome of candidates who had broad support throughout the
profession. 
<P>Generally speaking, however, the candidate who has won under
approval voting did well among bullet voters (those who voted for only one
candidate), as well as among those who voted for more than one candidate.
Further details can be found in Steven Brams and Peter Fishburn, 'Approval
Voting in Scientific and Engineering Societies, in <I>Group Decisions and
Negotiations,</I> Vol. 1, No. 1, pages 41-55; April 1992, and Steven Brams
and Jack Nagel, 'Approval Voting in Practice,' in <I>Public Choice,</I> Vol.
71, Nos. 1/2, pages 1-17; August 1991.
<P>"Although bills have been introduced in New Hampshire, New York and North
Dakota to institute approval voting in public elections, I am not aware of
any recent progress on that front.
<P>"In a recent study [Steven J. Brams and Samuel Merrill III, 'Would Ross
Perot Have Won the 1992 Presidential Election under Approval Voting?' in
<I>PS: Political Science and Politics,</I> Vol. 27, No. 1, pages 39-44;
March, 1994, we projected the likely outcome had approval voting been used
in the three-cornered 1992 presidential election. Based on polling data from
the American National Election Study, which asks voters to score each
candidate on a scale from 0 to 100, we projected approval-voting totals
using three different assumptions. The results consistently indicate that
Bill Clinton would have received approvals from about 55 percent, George
Bush from about 50 percent, and Ross Perot from about 40 percent. Hence,
Clinton would have attained majority support--enhancing his mandate--but his
margin over Bush would have been unchanged.
<P>"Perot would have doubled the 19 percent he received under plurality because
some Bush and especially Clinton supporters also approved Perot but opted to
cast their vote for one of the main contenders. Under approval voting,
Perot's total would therefore have more accurately reflected his true
support. Yet his chances of actually winning might have been reduced,
because voters deciding to cast a vote for Perot would not have had to
switch away from Clinton or Bush but could support both. In light of the
high disapproval rate that Perot faced, he would have been hard-pressed to
climb past Clinton's 55 percent approval.
<P>"It has been argued that approval voting benefits centrist candidates, who
tend to have a broader appeal, while not denying voters the opportunity to
express support for more extreme candidates, and that it should reduce
infighting between like-minded candidates because they need to share support
from the same voters. Approval voting could be implemented on existing
voting machines, and it could be done without a Constitutional amendment."

<P>Barry N. Taylor of the <A HREF="http://physics.nist.gov/TechAct.95/Div840/constants.html">Fundamental
Constants Data Center</A> at the <A HREF="http://www.nist.gov/">National
Institute of Standards and Technology</A> writes:
<P>"The origins of the meter go back to the 18th century. At that time, there
were two competing proposals for how to define a standard unit of measure, or
meter. The astronomer Christian Huygens suggested that the meter be defined by
the length of a pendulum having a period of one second; others favored a meter
defined as one ten-millionth the length of the earth's meridian along a quadrant
(one fourth the circumference of the earth). In 1791, soon after the French
Revolution, the French Academy of Sciences endorsed the meridian definition
because the force of gravity varies slightly over the surface of the earth,
affecting the period of a pendulum.
<P>"Researchers measured the arc from Dunkirk, France to Barcelona, Spain; on
June 22, 1799, the French Academy Archives adopted its standard meter, recorded
on a platinum bar. (The French government made the meter the compulsory standard
of measure in 1840.) The French, however, miscalculated the flattening of the
earth due to its rotation. As a result, the meter in the Archives is 0.2
millimeters shorter than one ten-millionth of the quadrant of the earth.
<P>"Despite its flaws, the French definition of the meter stuck. The Treaty of
the Meter was signed in 1875, and in 1889 a platinum-iridium bar was established
as the International Prototype Meter. (It was selected from several candidate
meters because it was the closest to the called the Meter of the Archives, the
platinum bar held in the French Academy.) So in fact at that time, a meter was
really defined as the length of a metal bar.
<P>"The meter bar lasted a good long time; but it became cumbersome and
error-prone to refer to a specific, physical meter bar. Finally, after 71 years,
a new standard emerged. In 1960 the General Conference on Weights and Measures
redefined the meter in terms of the number of waves of a very precise color
(wavelength) of light emitted by krypton 86 atoms. That revision did not last so
long. In 1983 the Conference discarded the krypton standard and redefined the
meter in terms of the speed of light--what might be called a theoretical
definition. The meter is now officially 1/299,792,458 the distance traveled by
light in a vacuum in one second.
<P>"These changing definitions offer a good example of what happens in the field
of measurement: as the tools and available precision change, the standards change
with them. These days, you can buy a laser from Hewlett-Packard and create a
reference meter on your own; the level of accuracy is far beyond what any
scientist could achieve a century ago."
<P>Fred Decker, a meteorologist at Oregon State University, offers some
additional insight:
<P>"I was for some years starting in 1946 an assistant to Willibald Weniger, a
truly great physics teacher, from whom I took over the Engineering Physics course
here at Oregon State. Weniger spiced his teaching of the principles of physics
with stories such as this description of the origin of the meter.
<P>"The standard meter was intended to be one ten-millionth of the distance from
pole to equator along the meridian through Paris. This came out of the
standardization attempted at the time of the French Revolution. The basic
measurements had inevitable error, which led to the markings on the bar at Sevres
being slightly different from that definition. The bar was, however, still
considered the standard, just as the British standard yard was legally
established as the distance between two scratches on a bronze bar. Both systems
are arbitrary in this sense, although the standard meter was at least intended to
have its length related to the dimension of the earth.
<P>"There is a lot of the history of the growth of economic activity as well as
political development involved in all these standards. For example, someone will
inevitably want to know why the meridian of Greenwich became the prime meridian,
rather than that of the great observatory at Paris! That is an intriguing
anecdote itself. Seafarers sailing from the Thames synchronized ship time to the
dropping of a ball at Greenwich; the sailors set their chronometers there and
then computed their longitude at sea based on ephemerides of heavenly bodies.
<P>"It is interesting also that habit and convenience in daily use seems to keep
the British units in use, despite very determined efforts for decades to
encourage popular acceptance and of metric system units in the U.S. and U.K."

<FONT size=4><B> <A NAME="q11">"I've heard that the police are
now using lasers in addition to radar to catch speeders on the highway. How does
a laser measure the speed of a car?" </A></B></FONT>
<P>-<I>T.N. Eugene, Oregon</I>
<P>This question seems to provoke confusion between two very different ways to
measure speed: Doppler shifts (the change in frequency that occurs when a signal
hits a moving target) and timing delays (the duration required for a signal to
bounce off a target and return to its place of origin). Police radar makes use of
Doppler shifts. Laser speed guns rely on timing delays, as explained by James A.
Worthey in the Office of Law Enforcement Standards at the <A
HREF="http://www.nist.gov/">National Institute of Standards and Technology</A> in
Gaithersburg, Maryland:
<P>"The laser speed gun used by the police contains a pulsed diode laser. When
the police officer squeezes the trigger, the laser emits a brief pulse of
infrared light, which is focused by a lens so that it travels as a narrow beam.
The pulse reflects off the moving car; a small fraction of the original pulse
energy is received by a second lens and focused onto a fast, sensitive detector
(such as an avalanche photodiode). Electronic timing circuits measure the pulse's
round-trip time of flight.
<P>"Multiplying the round trip time by the speed of light in air and dividing by
2 (because of the round trip) gives the distance, or 'range,' of the car. A few
milliseconds later, the laser pulses for a new range measurement. The new range
will be slightly less or more, depending on whether the car is moving toward the
policeman or away. The laser speed gun continues to collect data in this way
until dozens of range measurements have been made; the whole process takes only
about half a second. The data are then analyzed by a computer in the speed gun.
If the range changed steadily during the series of measurements, then the 'slope
of the graph'--that is, the change in distance between each pulse--indicates the
motorist's speed. If the range data did not change steadily, this is an
indication of error.
<P>"If the computer is satisfied that the data are good, the speed gun displays
the speed and range (distance) of the car. Of course, the range has only an
approximate meaning because the car is moving. The same laser speed guns can be
used to make very accurate measurements of the distances to stationary objects.
<P>The level of precision needed to catch a speeding automobile is quite
remarkable, as Worthey details. "The speed of light in air is 299,705,663 meters
per second," he notes. "If the car is 150 meters (about 500 feet) away, then the
round-trip travel time for the laser pulse is about one microsecond, that is, one
millionth of a second. To determine speed accurately, the speed gun must measure
time with split-nanosecond (billionths of a second) accuracy."

<!--------------> <FONT size=4><B> <A NAME="qx">"In the February issue of
Scientific American, Phil and Phylis Morrison repeat the "purist" claim that the
next millennium will start on January 1, 2001. This seems naive. When we count,
we implicitly start with zero, not one. So why is the year 2000 not the first
year of millennium three?" </A></B></FONT>
<P>-<I>Wilton R. Abbott, Los Altos Hills, Calif.</I>
<P>For better or for worse, there is no year zero in our calendar. Rather, the
chronology runs directly from 1 B.C. to 1 A.D.--and nothing in between.
Therefore, the first century A.D. (or C.E., for Common Era) began on January 1 of
the year 1, not of the year 0. The start of the second century would have been
precisely 100 years after that, on January 1 of the year 101 A.D. By similar
reasoning, the 21st century begins on January 1 of the year 2001, not of 2000.
Thus goes the unassailable argument of the mathematical purists.
<P>Mathematical logic is no match for human custom, however, which greatly
complicates matters. Over the centuries, the calendar has been revised
repeatedly. When Britain and its colonies switched from the Old Style Julian
calendar to the more astronomically correct Gregorian calendar in 1752, by act of
Parliament September 14 immediately followed September 2--a loss of 11 days.
Strictly speaking, then, the 18th century was 11 days shorter than previous and
subsequent centuries. Moreover, the packaging of years into decades, centuries,
millenia or other units is more often a convention of convenience than of
precision, and so may not be bound by strict rules of mathematical rigor.
<P>So although the purists have reason on their side, the 21st century will
probably begin when most people decide to celebrate it. Yet even that popular
decision may not affect the date historians choose.

"What do we know about the nature of attention-deficit
disorder (ADD)? And why does the drug Ritalin seem to reduce the
symptoms of ADD?"
</A></B></FONT>

<P>--<I>Shauna Rae Brown <BR>Chandler,Ariz.</I>

<P>Madelyn Griffith-Haynie founded and manages the Optimal
Functioning Institute in New York City; she also publishes the
Optimal Functioning Newsletter, an e-zine combining coaching
viewpoints and ADD issues, and develops content for the <A
HREF="http://www.addcoach.com/addcoachhome.html"TARGET="_top"">ADDCoach</A>
Web site. She is herself ADD. Griffith-Haynie replies:

<P>"I'd like to start by reviewing some facts about ADD. ADD has
been medically described <A
HREF="http://www4.interaccess.com/add/disorders/history.html"TARGET="_top"">since
1902</A>. There is little agreement about what causes it, how to
diagnose it and how to treat it. According to some studies, ADD
affects as many as 10 million Americans, many of them adults,
and approximately 4 percent of school-age children. Males are
more likely to exhibit associated hyperactivity
(attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, or AD/HD); that
hyperactivity may help explain why three times as many males as
females have been diagnosed with ADD. Depending on whose
statistics you believe, about 80 percent of children and 50
percent of adults improve with medications.

<P>"Now, some <A
HREF="http://www4.interaccess.com/add/disorders/myth.html"TARGET="_top"">myths</A>.
Myth: ADD disappears during puberty. Myth: Physical
hyperactivity must be present to confirm an AD/HD diagnosis.
Myth: Positive response to medication is confirmation of
diagnosis. Myth: Distractibility is responsive to will. Myth:
ADD can be prevented with good prenatal care. Myth: Good
parenting can prevent much of the acting out in ADD children.
Myth: By extension, poor parenting is responsible for behavior
problems in ADD children. Myth: Parents who medicate their
children are trying to make their own lives easier. Myth: ADD
medication removes will and creativity.

<P>"The defining feature of ADD, as the name indicates, is a
problem with 'attending,' which may be defined as focusing
selectively on an intended stimulus, sustaining that focus and
shifting it at will. The following characteristics are the
result of disordered attending: difficulty focusing attention;
poor organization and task completion; low stress tolerance;
hyperactivity; impulsivity; mood swings; difficulty with time
management; trouble with transitions; and perfectionism, or
black-and-white thinking.

<P>"ADD has been medically described for almost 100 years as
minimal brain damage (MBD), hyperkinetic reaction of childhood
(HRC), attention-deficit disorder (ADD) and, most recently,
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (AD/HD). The consistent
recognition of ADD began when the first amphetamine studies were
published in l988, just as child psychiatry really
differentiated itself from its origins in adult psychiatry.

<P>"Motor hyperactivity dominated early thinking about ADD, both
because it was such a dramatic problem and because it seemed to
respond so markedly to the use of stimulants. But because motor
hyperactivity tends to lessen with age, the idea that ADD was
primarily a childhood disorder--outgrown when the hyperactivity
was no longer overt--became popular, fanned by ADD's placement
in the child psychiatry section of the <A
HREF="http://web.cs.mun.ca/~jamie/dsm4.html"TARGET="_top""><I>Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual</I></A> (DSM). We now know that ADD persists
beyond childhood and that overt symptoms of hyperactivity are
not necessarily present in every ADDer. ADDers can appear
'driven' or 'dreamy/spacey,' hyperactive or inattentive, or a
combination of both.

<P>"Although everyone gets distracted sometimes, an ADD diagnosis
is one of degree and persistence. An individual must present
symptoms severe enough to be clearly maladaptive and
inconsistent with his or her developmental level and to have
caused some evident impairments since childhood in at least two
settings (for instance, at home and at work or school). There is
no blood test, CT scan or other fully researched quantitative
measure of ADD, so diagnosis relies heavily on anecdotal
evidence. We know the disorder only by the prevalence,
persistence and degree of disability caused by its presenting
symptoms.

<P>"The efficacy of <A
HREF="http://www.mentalhealth.com/drug/p30-r03.html"TARGET="_top"">Ritalin</A>
in treating ADD may seem surprising given that Ritalin is a
stimulant medication. If ADDers seem overstimulated, why would a
stimulant calm them down? The answer seems to be that some
neurons are working overtime while others are underfunctioning
in a person with ADD. Stimulating the latter actually brings
about a balance.

<P>"Contrary to the long-standing misconception, stimulants work
exactly the same way on an ADDer's brain as on anybody
else's--they stimulate specific neurons, causing them to secrete
neurotransmitters (chemical messengers that brain cells use to
communicate). The symptoms of ADD are caused by a need for
stimulation in exactly those sites where stimulant medications
such as Ritalin work.

<P>"Thanks to the work of Alan Zametkin of the National Institute
of Mental Health and his associates, published in 1990, and the
ongoing work of ADD doctors such as Daniel Amen (author of
<I>Windows into the ADD Mind</I>), we are beginning to gain
insight into <A
HREF="http://www.mhsource.com/hy/brainadhd.html"TARGET="_top"">which areas of
the brain are not functioning normally</A> when ADDers attempt
to concentrate on certain types of tasks. ADDers exhibit
underfunctioning in the prefrontal cortex, the area of the brain
that secretes many of the neurotransmitters signaling the brain
to pay attention to specific stimuli and to ignore others. There
is much less activity in the brain of an ADDer in those areas
responsible for filtering and focusing, compared with the brain
of a non-ADDer attempting the same tasks.

<P>"The problem is compounded by the marvelous way our brain adapts
to injury: when one area of the brain becomes incapacitated, new
neural networks are formed in other areas to take on tasks
formerly accomplished with the aid of the now injured area.
Brain activity scans show that there is much more going on
outside the prefrontal cortex of ADDers than in the brains of
normally functioning individuals attempting the same tasks. So
we ADDers, with disabled brain areas for filtering and focusing,
have more stimulation from the rest of the brain than our
non-ADD counterparts, who do have filters. No wonder we get
distracted and a little short-tempered at the effort required to
manage the informational and sensory overload!

<P>"When the neurons in the prefrontal cortex are stimulated with
medications, stimulant foods, certain 'natural' remedies (or the
naturally occurring adrenaline that accompanies waiting until
the last minute to attempt to do a project), the neurons produce
their chemical messengers in greater supply. A non-ADDer with a
normally functioning prefrontal cortex experiences an excess of
these neurotransmitters and feels 'speeded up' as a result. An
ADDer (having an underfunctioning prefrontal cortex) experiences
a state similar to the one non-ADDers live with most of the
time, and the rest of the brain stops overcompensating. Freed of
the excess activity in the rest of the brain and with a sudden
ability to focus, the ADDer feels calmer than before and so may
appear to slow down.

<P>"Just as no two stroke victims have identical brain injuries or
compensation responses, no two ADDers have brains that
underfunction and overcompensate in the same way--which is why
some stroke victims recover lost functions over time when others
don't, and why stimulants have different rates of effectiveness
on different ADDers. And in the same way that glasses on a
nearsighted child do not produce the miracle of literacy all by
themselves, stimulant medications merely make the ADDer
available for learning; they do not deliver the learning. There
are no magic bullets, and none of us escapes the fact that
living is a 'hands-on' experience. It does make a difference,
however, when those 'hands' are functioning optimally."

"What is known about the nature and diagnosis of Tourette's
syndrome? Do we know what causes it, and can it ever be
cured?"</A></B></FONT>

<P>-<I>Debbie Eckardt, Eugene, Ore.</I>

<P>Jonathan W. Mink, an assistant professor of neurology and
anatomy and neurobiology at the <A
HREF="http://medicine.wustl.edu/" TARGET="_top">Washington
University School
of Medicine</A>, responds:

<P>"Tourette's syndrome is a neurologic disorder characterized
by
intermittent, brief involuntary movements or sounds that are
called tics. They can range from simple blinking, facial
twitches or sniffing sounds to more complex movements and
vocalizations. (The involuntary swearing that people commonly
associate with Tourette's is actually only one tiny example from
the wide variety of symptoms the disorder may produce.) Tics can
be quite mild and barely noticeable to an untrained observer or
even to the person who has them. They can also be severe enough
to interfere significantly with a person's daily activities. In
addition to tics, people who have Tourette's syndrome often
exhibit obsessions and compulsions, lack of impulse control or
attention-deficit disorder.

<P>"It is thought that Tourette's syndrome stems from an
abnormality in a part of the brain called the basal ganglia. The
exact cause of the abnormality is unknown but is thought to be
genetic because most people who show symptoms of Tourette's have
other family members who also display such symptoms. The
presumed genetic basis of Tourette's is not simple, however, and
the syndrome may involve more than one gene. Although Tourette's
most likely is a genetic disorder, the symptoms that define the
disorder vary considerably, even among members of a single
family. There is no 'test' for Tourette's; rather diagnosis is
based on the presence of several features that are generally
agreed to be essential aspects of the syndrome.

<P>"Just as the cause of Tourette's is unknown, there is also no
known cure. There are medications than can be quite effective in
reducing the symptoms, however. Different medications are
effective for different symptoms. For example, a medication that
reduces tics may not help with impulse control or compulsions.
Therefore, for each person with Tourette's the choice of
medication will depend on which symptoms are the most troubling
for that individual. In fact, many people afflicted Tourette's
syndrome are able to do well without ever taking any medication
at all."

"What causes the noise we hear when we crack our knuckles or pop
other joints? I've read that the sound comes from the release of
gas bubbles. If so, what sort of gas bubbles are they, and how
can releasing them possibly make so much noise?"</A></B></FONT>

<P>-<I>William Vai, San Francisco, Calif.</I>

<P>Raymond Brodeur in the <A
HREF="http://www.ergo.msu.edu/" TARGET="_top">Ergonomics
Research
Laboratory</A> at Michigan State University responds:

<P>"To understand what happens when you 'crack' your knuckles,
or
any other joint, first you need a little background about the
nature of the joints of the body. The type of joints that you
can most easily 'pop' or 'crack' are the diarthrodial joints.
These are your most typical
joints. They consist of two bones that contact each other at
their cartilage surfaces; the cartilage surfaces are surrounded
by a <A
HREF="http://www.duq.edu/PT/RA/EffectsOnJoints.html#Anatomy"
TARGET="_top">joint capsule</A>. Inside
the joint capsule is a lubricant, known as synovial fluid, which
also serves as a source of nutrients for the cells that maintain
the joint cartilage. In addition, the synovial fluid contains
dissolved gases, including oxygen, nitrogen and carbon dioxide.

<P>"The easiest joints to pop are the ones in your fingers (the
interphalangeal and the metacarpophalangeal joints). As the
joint capsule stretches, its expansion is limited by a number of
factors. When small forces are applied to the joint, one factor
that limits the motion is the volume of the joint. That volume
is set by the amount of synovial fluid contained in the joint.
The synovial fluid cannot expand unless the pressure inside the
capsule drops to a point at which the dissolved gases can escape
the solution; when the gases come out of solution, they increase
the volume and hence the mobility of the joint.

<P>"The cracking or popping sound is thought to be caused by the
gases rapidly coming out of solution, allowing the capsule to
stretch a little further. The stretching of the joint is soon
thereafter limited by the length of the capsule. If you take an
x-ray of the joint after cracking, you can see a gas bubble
inside the joint. This gas increases the joint volume by 15 to
20 percent; it consists mostly (about 80 percent) of carbon
dioxide. The joint cannot be cracked again until the gases have
dissolved back into the synovial fluid, which explains why you
cannot crack the same knuckle repeatedly.

<P>"But how can releasing such a small quantity of gas cause so
much noise? There is no good answer for this question.
Researchers have estimated the energy levels of the sound by
using accelerometers to measure the vibrations caused during
joint popping. The amounts of energy involved are very small, on
the order of 0.1 milli-joule per cubic millimeter. Studies have
also shown that there are two sound peaks during knuckle
cracking, but the causes of these peaks are unknown. It is
likely that the first sound is related to the gas dissolving out
of solution, whereas the second sound is caused by the capsule
reaching its length limit.

<P>"A common, related question is, Does popping a joint cause
any
damage? There are actually little scientific data available on
this topic. One study found no correlation between knuckle
cracking and osteoarthritis in the finger joints. Another study,
however, showed that repetitive knuckle cracking may affect the
soft tissue surrounding the joint. Also, the habit tends to
cause an increase in hand swelling and a decrease in the grip
strength of the hand.

<P>"Another source of popping and cracking sounds is the tendons
and ligaments near the joint. Tendons must cross at least one
joint in order to cause motion. But when a joint moves, the
tendon's position with respect to the joint is forced to change.
It is not uncommon for a tendon to shift to a slightly different
position, followed by a sudden snap as the tendon returns to its
original location with respect to the joint. These noises are
often heard in the knee and ankle joints when standing up from a
seated position or when walking up or down the stairs."

"Is it possible to engineer viruses to perform specific tasks within a
human host--that is, to create viruses that are beneficial rather than
detrimental to human health?"</A></B></FONT>

<P>-<I>Simon Stafford, Canberra, Australia</I>

<P><A HREF="http://www.miracosta.cc.ca.us/home/lsnider/" TARGET="_top">Leslie Snider</A>, a
biotechnology instructor at MiraCosta College in Oceanside, Calif.,
responds:

<P><P>"Not only is it possible to engineer viruses to be beneficial, it is
already being done. Viruses have primarily been engineered for use by
humans as so-called recombinant (or subunit) vaccines. In this technology,
the genetic material of a harmful virus is analyzed to identify the gene
or genes that encode the antigens (identifying proteins) that trigger the
body's immune response. These genes can then be isolated and inserted into
host cells, usually bacteria or yeast. The host cells in turn manufacture
the antigens in large quantities. The antigens are injected into humans
and result in the formation of 'memory' B cells, which are tailored to the
alien antigen, thereby protecting against the disease caused by the whole
virus. The first recombinant vaccine designed for human use immunizes
against hepatitis B; it was approved by the <A
HREF="http://www.fda.gov/" TARGET="_top">Food and Drug Administration</A> in 1986.

<P>"Viruses also have long been used as cloning vectors, tools for inserting
genetic material into a variety of host cells (including bacteria, yeast
and mammalian cells). These host cells are grown in the laboratory under
controlled conditions. There are many research projects that focus on the
use of viruses to insert normal, healthy human genes into human cells
grown in the lab. Some of these engineered cells may be suitable for
therapeutic use to alleviate the symptoms of disease or perhaps even
provide a kind of cure. Such treatments are currently being tested for the
treatment of emphysema and cystic fibrosis. These diseases affect lung
tissue, and it is relatively easy to deliver the engineered cells to the
lungs via aerosol sprays.

<P>"The use of viruses to inject genetic information into cells of living
organisms (for instance, to insert normal genes into the cells of a
patient whose disease is caused by a genetic flaw) is much more difficult
and will require a great deal of additional research. Nevertheless,
researchers are pursuing a number of promising possibilities toward this
goal. For example, some scientists are working on schemes to use viruses
to deliver normal genes directly into the cells in the lungs of people who
have cystic fibrosis or into the cells lining the walls of blood vessels
in order to prevent atherosclerosis."

"What do we know about the cause of Werner syndrome and progeria, the
disease that leads to premature aging in children?"</A></B></FONT>

<P>-<I>Tom Dilley, Makanda, Ill.</I>

<P><A HREF="http://www.pathology.washington.edu/faculty/martin.html" TARGET="_top">George
M. Martin</A>, professor of pathology and director of the Alzheimer's
Disease Research Center at the University of Washington, comments:

<P>"I appreciate this opportunity to communicate to your readers, as
journalists have often overstated the significance of the <A
HREF="http://science-mag.aaas.org/science/scripts/display/short/272/5259/193.html" TARGET="_top">genes
for Werner syndrome and Hutchinson-Gilford progeria</A> as keys to the
understanding of aging. These are actually two distinctly different
disorders; a major clinical difference is that the onset of the
Hutchinson-Gilford syndrome (sometimes called progeria of childhood)
occurs within the first decade of life, whereas the first evidence of
Werner syndrome (sometimes called progeria of the adult) appears in
adolescence, when the individual fails to undergo the usual growth spurt.
A good clinician can make the diagnosis of Hutchinson-Gilford in the first
two or three years of life.

<P>"It is an exaggeration to refer to these genetic disorders as 'diseases of
premature aging.' While patients do indeed have an external appearance of
premature aging and suffer from some of the common ailments of older
people, there are a number of clinical features that differ from that
which is observed in most individuals as they age. For example, Werner
syndrome patients develop neoplasms prematurely, but the neoplasms tend to
be those derived from mesenchymal rather than epithelial cells; the latter
are the main source of tumors of older people. Werner patients suffer from
osteoporosis, but the distribution is unusual in that it is very severe in
the long bones of the legs. They also develop unusual deposits of calcium
in the soft tissues and ulcers around their elbows and ankles. Patients
who have Hutchinson-Gilford syndrome experience arthritis of the hips, but
it is a result of having been born with dislocated hips. Their clavicles
also develop abnormally.

<P>"Nevertheless, both these diseases are important to study because
identifying the underlying mutations that cause them could enlarge our
understanding of such important disorders as diabetes, cancer, cataracts
and atherosclerosis. The autosomal recessive mutation responsible for
Werner syndrome has recently been identified by a group led by Chang-En Yu
of the University of Washington (see the April 12, 1996, issue of <A
HREF="http://science-mag.aaas.org/science/scripts/display/short/272/5259/258.html" TARGET="_top"><I>Science</I></A>,
Vol. 272, page 258). This mutation affects a member of a large family of
enzymes, called helicases, that act to unwind DNA (and sometimes RNA) in
order to facilitate such processes as the replication, repair,
transcription and recombination of DNA. Some helicases may also be
important in ensuring the accuracy of chromosomal segregation. Precisely
which subset of these functions is critical in producing the pathology of
progeria is not yet known.

<P>"The fact that a helicase mutation is responsible for the disorder lends
support to several lines of evidence indicating that the somatic cells of
Werner syndrome patients are especially prone to mutations. In this
respect, they are similar to individuals who have Bloom syndrome, a
recessive genetic disorder also caused by a defective helicase (Nathan A. Ellis
et al. in <I>Cell,</I> Vol. 83, No. 4, page 655;
November 17, 1995). The mutation underlying the
Hutchinson-Gilford syndrome is probably a sporadic, autosomal-dominant one
(W. T. Brown in <I>American Journal of Clinical Nutrition,</I>
Vol. 55, No. 6(Supplement), page 1222S; June 1992).
The responsible gene has not yet been identified, however, so
we remain ignorant of its pathogenesis."

<P><A
HREF="http://dauerdigs.biosci.missouri.edu/Dauer-World/People/David-Gems.html%25" TARGET="_top">David
Gems</A>, a professor in the division of biological sciences at the
University of Missouri at Columbia, offers a somewhat different view of
progeria:

<P>"Werner syndrome is the most common form of progeria. The first signs of
this disorder appear only after puberty, with the full symptoms becoming
manifest in individuals 20 to 30 years old. A much rarer progeria,
Hutchinson-Gilford syndrome, develops earlier: victims die, apparently of
old age, typically at around age 12. It is fortunate that this hereditary
disease occurs very infrequently.

<P>"The potential value of understanding the cause of diseases such as Werner
syndrome is hard to overstate. Nowadays those involved in aging research
increasingly view aging in terms of a genetic disease rather than as a
natural, evolution-driven process by which the old make way for the young.
Viewed in this new light, the condition of aged friends and relatives, and
of older people seen in the street, suddenly seems terrible to conceive:
they are afflicted with a ghastly wasting disease, a plague whose effects
are inescapably scripted by our own genes.

<P>"Werner syndrome results from mutation of a single gene. Is it possible
that by understanding the healthy version of the gene we can begin to
learn how genes control lifespan and so take the first step down the road
toward curing the disease of aging? Unfortunately, the answer is not yet
at all certain, for two major reasons. First, it remains unclear whether
the symptoms of Werner syndrome really correspond to an acceleration of
the aging process or whether the resemblance to aging is merely
superficial. Although Werner syndrome victims prematurely show some of the
signs of aging (such as graying of the hair and hair loss,
atherosclerosis, osteoporosis and type II diabetes mellitus), they fail to
show others. For example, they exhibit no premature cognitive decline or
Alzheimer's symptoms. And they experience many symptoms not associated
with normal aging (such as ulceration of the skin, particularly around the
ankles, alteration of the vocal chords resulting in a high-pitched voice,
and an absence of the growth spurt that normally occurs after puberty).

<P>"The second problem is the lack of an animal model for Werner syndrome
that could be employed to study the disease in detail. Progeria is
dreadful enough for those suffering from it without having gerontologists
hovering around wanting to do tests and snip off bits of you.

<P>"In April 1996 the study of Werner syndrome was greatly advanced by the
announcement of the cloning and sequencing of WRN, the gene which when
mutated gives rise to the disease. In some instances, the identity of a
gene provides immediate insight into the nature of the disease resulting
from defects in it. This was true, for example, when the gene for cystic
fibrosis was cloned. Unfortunately, as is more often the case, the WRN
gene is more enigmatic. It encodes a protein that most closely resembles a
DNA helicase. DNA helicases are enzymes involved in DNA repair and
recombination, suggesting that Werner syndrome results from failure in
these processes.

<P>"There are reasons to treat this hypothesis cautiously, however. The
capacity of the WRN protein to act as a helicase has yet to be
demonstrated, and there are other genetic diseases resulting from
mutations in genes encoding DNA helicases that do not resemble Werner
syndrome. <A
HREF="http://www3.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/htbin-post/Omim/dispmim?278700" TARGET="_top">Xeroderma
pigmentosum</A> and <A
HREF="http://www3.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/htbin-post/Omim/dispmim?216400" TARGET="_top">Cockayne
syndrome</A>, which also result from defective DNA helicases, result in
increased sensitivity of cells to ultraviolet radiation. This is thought
to happen because ultraviolet rays damage DNA, which cannot be properly
repaired by the mutant helicases. Yet Werner syndrome cells are not
abnormally sensitive to ultraviolet radiation. In short, it is known that
defects in a putative DNA helicase are the cause of Werner syndrome, but
it is not known how this defect results in the disease.

<P>"It is possible that the most valuable short-term consequence of knowing
the identity of the Werner syndrome gene is that it may allow the
development of an animal model for studying the disease. Researchers have
not yet determined whether it is possible to create a mouse whose genetic
equivalent of the WRN gene contains the same mutation that causes Werner
syndrome in humans and, if so, whether the mutation produces accelerated
aging in the mouse. The latter question is particularly difficult because
aging is still so poorly understood. The primary determinants of aging in
animals are unknown. It is not even clear whether aging is determined by
organism-wide processes, such as immunologic or hormonal changes, or by
events occurring independently in different cells, tissues or organs.
Arguably, only with the experimental flexibility provided by an animal
model will it be possible to establish whether accelerated aging actually
occurs in Werner syndrome and, if so, how this aging occurs."

<P>Gerard Schellenberg of the <A HREF="http://www.washington.edu/" TARGET="_top">University
of Washington</A>, who participated in the recent cloning of the WRN gene,
adds some additional information:

<P>"Werner syndrome is an inherited disease that is extremely rare, affecting
somewhere between one in 100,000 and one in 1,000,000 individuals. The
inheritance is autosomal recessive, meaning that someone will develop
Werner syndrome only if both copies of the disease gene are mutated.

<P>"The gene responsible for the syndrome was localized to chromosome 8 in
1992 by Dennis Dryna and his colleagues. In 1996 my group in Seattle,
along with a number of collaborators, cloned the gene responsible for the
disease. The responsible gene encodes a previously unknown protein that
has a strong homology to a class of enzymes called helicases. These
enzymes unwind DNA or RNA; in other words, they convert a double-stranded
molecule into two single-stranded molecules. Higher organisms, including
humans, have a number of different helicase genes. Each probably functions
in a different process requiring the unwinding of DNA or RNA. Examples of
processes in which helicases are required are DNA replication, repair and
transcription, to name just a few.

<P>"The function of Werner syndrome helicase is currently unknown. What is
clear is that subjects with the syndrome probably do not produce a
functional form of this protein. We do know that DNA in affected subjects
appears to contain a large number of damaged sites. This accumulation of
DNA damage is probably the cause of the symptoms we call Werner syndrome.
Cells from Werner syndrome subjects do not appear to be defective for any
known DNA repair process, so the primary defect probably involves a defect
in a process that causes DNA damage, rather than one that repairs damage
caused by other agents. Having the gene in hand gives a tool for beginning
to answer these questions."

"What is a prion? Specifically, what is known about the molecular structure
of prions and how they cause infections such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease?"</A></B></FONT>

<P>-<I>Anders Hedberg, Stockholm, Sweden</I>

<P><A HREF="http://www.hhmi.org/science/genetics/lindquis.htm">Susan
Lindquist</A> is a researcher at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute,
located in the department of molecular genetics and cell biology at the
University of Chicago. She responds:

<P>"'Prion' is a term first used to describe the mysterious infectious agent
responsible for several neurodegenerative diseases found in mammals,
including <A HREF="http://www.cjd.ed.ac.uk/intro.htm">Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease</A> (CJD) in humans. The word itself derives from 'proteinaceous
infectious particle'; it refers to the initially heretical hypothesis that
the infectious agent causing those diseases consists only of protein, with
no nucleic acid genome. (All previously known pathogens, such as bacteria
and viruses, contain nucleic acids, which enable them to reproduce.) The
prion hypothesis explained why the mysterious infectious agent is resistant
to ultraviolet radiation, which breaks down nucleic acids, but is
susceptible to substances that disrupt proteins.

<P>"A major breakthrough occurred when researchers discovered that the
infectious agent consists primarily of a protein found in the membranes of
normal cells, but in this case the protein has an altered shape, or
conformation. Some scientists hypothesized that the distorted protein could
bind to other proteins of the same type and induce them to change their
conformation as well, producing a chain reaction that propagates the disease
and generates new infectious material. Since then, the gene for this protein
has been successfully cloned, and studies using transgenic mice have
bolstered the prion hypothesis. The evidence in support of the hypothesis is
now very strong, though not incontrovertible.

<P>"Research on prion diseases has recently accelerated for several reasons.
First, the mounting experimental evidence has generated great interest in
what appears to be a totally new kind of mechanism of disease. Second, the
demonstration that prions are responsible for 'mad cow' disease (bovine
spongiform encephalopathy), which has infected large numbers of cattle in
Great Britain and panicked the public, has lent new urgency to the quest for
a cure--especially since the discovery that infected cows might be
responsible for several new cases of CJD in humans. Finally, I and my
colleagues have recently determined that a <A
HREF="http://science-mag.aaas.org/science/scripts/display/short/273/5275/580.html">phenomenon
much like prion infection</A> exists in yeast.

<P>"In the case of yeast, the phenomenon involves the passing of a particular
genetic trait from mother cells to daughter cells, rather than the
transmission of an infectious agent from one individual to another. These
genetic traits had been known for many years, but their baffling patterns of
inheritance (for example, they can be passed along through a cell's
cytoplasm, rather than the nucleus where the DNA resides) had eluded explanation.
We now know that the genetic trait is transmitted by proteins that are
encoded in the nucleus but that can change their conformation in the
cytoplasm. Once this change has occurred, the reconfigured proteins induce
other newly made proteins of the same type to change their conformation,
too. Molecular genetic research on yeast should speed up the resolution of
fundamental questions about the workings of protein-folding chain reactions.
And more important, it suggests that the prion mechanism is ubiquitous among
living things and may be responsible for many phenomena other than
neurodegenerative diseases like CJD."

<P><A HREF="http://www.ucd.ie/~zoology/rogers.html">Mark Rogers</A> in the department of zoology and the
Biotechnology Centre at University College, Dublin, adds some further
information:

<P>"The term 'prion' was coined by Stanley B. Prusiner of the University of
California School of Medicine at San Francisco in 1982 to distinguish the
infectious agent that causes scrapie in sheep, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
(CJD) in humans and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle from
other, more typical infectious agents. The prion hypothesis postulates that
these diseases are caused not by a conventional virus or bacterium but by a
protein that has adopted an abnormal form. 

<P>"The process by which this change occurs is not clear and there is a great
deal of work under way to establish the structure of the prion protein in
both its normal and aberrant forms. Recently scientists have developed a
molecular model of both variants and have published papers describing the
structure of prion proteins (as manufactured by <I>E. coli</I> bacteria that
were altered through recombinant DNA techniques). Further work using
magnetic resonance imaging and x-ray crystallography should help us
understand the key structural elements that allow the prion to co-opt the
normal cellular form into the disease-producing variant. It is likely that
other cellular components assist in this process, so work on understanding
the cell biology of both forms of the protein is also vital."

<P><A HREF="http://www.le.ac.uk/CWIS/AD/MI/ST/sh1.html">Shaun Heaphy</A> in the
department of microbiology and immunology at Leicester University provides
this overview:

<P>"A number of fatal neurodegenerative diseases in humans--such as
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), kuru and Gerstmann-Str&#228;ussler-Scheinker
(GSS) disease--are thought to be caused by an infectious agent known as a
prion. Prions also cause disease in a wide variety of other animals,
including scrapie in sheep and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in
cows. Collectively these diseases are known as transmissible spongiform
encephalopathies.

<P>"The cause of CJD was unknown for many years; it occurred seemingly
randomly, at a very low incidence. In the 1950s an epidemic transmissible
disease called kuru, similar to CJD, was identified in the Fore tribe of
Papua New Guinea. Transmission of the disease occurred during a ritual
funeral process in which the brain of a dead tribe member was removed from
the skull, cooked and eaten. Scientific analysis of the brains of people who
had died from CJD or kuru showed that their brain tissue had a spongiform
appearance, that is, there were holes where cells ought to be, indicating an
encephalopathy, or reduction in the number of brain cells. 

<P>"<A HREF="http://www.nih.gov/ninds/neurosci/basic/lcnss/lcnss.htm">D.
Carleton Gajdusek</A>, working at the U.S. National Institutes of Health,
demonstrated that extracts of brain prepared from people who had died of CJD
or kuru could cause a similar disease when inoculated into the brain of
chimpanzees. These experiments obviously suggested the presence of an
infectious agent. That inference has been confirmed by the inadvertent
transmission of CJD to patients undergoing various medical treatments, such
as corneal transplants and human growth hormone therapy.

<P>"Confusingly, researchers also recognized that some prion diseases, such as
GSS, were inherited. The pattern of inheritance was recognized as being
autosomal and dominant, meaning that if a parent developed GSS, there was a
50 percent chance that a child of either sex would also develop the disease.
Any explanation for the cause of a prion disease therefore has to account
for random, inherited and transmitted variants of the disease.

<P>"Although there is not yet a universally accepted explanation of this
puzzle, progress is being made. We now know that a normal cellular protein,
called PrP ( for proteinaceous infectious particle) and which is found in
all of us, is centrally involved in the spread of prion diseases. This
protein consists of about 250 amino acids.

<P>"Some researchers believe that the prions are formed when PrP associates
with a foreign pathogenic nucleic acid. This is called the virino
hypothesis. (Viruses consist of proteins and nucleic acids that are
specified by the virus genome. A virino would also consist of proteins and
nucleic acids, but the protein component is specified by the host genome,
not the pathogen genome). In support of the virino hypothesis is the
existence of different strains of prions that cause differing patterns of
disease and breed true; the existence of strains in pathogens is usually the
result of changes in the nucleic acid sequence of the infectious agent.
Scientists have not found any nucleic acid associated with a prion, however,
despite intensive efforts in many laboratories. Furthermore, prions appear
to remain infectious even after being exposed to treatments that destroy
nucleic acids.

<P>"This evidence has led to the now widely accepted prion theory, which states
that the cellular protein PrP is the sole causative agent of prion diseases;
there is no nucleic acid involved. The theory holds that PrP is normally in
a stable shape (pN) that does not cause disease. The protein can be flipped,
however, into an abnormal shape (pD) that does cause disease. pD is
infectious because it can associate with pN and convert it to pD, in an
exponential process--each pD can convert more pN to pD.

<P>"Prions can be transmitted, possibly by eating and certainly by inoculation
either directly into the brain or into skin and muscle tissue. Exponential
amplification of the prion (converting pN into pD in the body) would then
result in disease. Occasional, sporadic cases of prion diseases arise in
middle or old age, presumably because there is a very small but real chance
that pN can spontaneously flip to pD; the cumulative likelihood of such a
flip grows over the years. Inherited cases of CJD and GSS may result from
mutations in the PrP gene, which gives rise to changes in the amino acid
sequence of the PrP protein. This change would increase the probability of
pN transforming into pD, so that the disease would almost certainly occur. 

<P>"Physical analysis of the structure of PrP provides some direct evidence for
the existence of two different (normal and aberrant) shapes. Recently the
structure of the core part of the PrP protein was determined by magnetic
resonance image analysis. Mutations that cause prion disease are clustered
within or adjacent to key structural elements in the protein, so it is easy
to imagine that mutations destabilize the structure of pN and cause it to
reconfigure into pD.

<P>"The prion theory has not been proved correct, but much evidence now
supports it. We do not yet know why the pD structure of a prion would result
in neurodegeneration, but we do know that prion protein accumulates in brain
tissue. One part of the prion protein can cause apoptosis, or programmed
cell death; perhaps this mechanism explains the pattern of the disease.

<P>"Prions have long intrigued scientists because of their unusual properties.
Recently the general public has become interested in them as well because of
the epidemic of BSE, more dramatically known as mad cow disease. Hundreds of
thousands of infected animals have been eaten by Europeans and particularly
the British over the past 10 years. The latest research suggests that the
infected meat may pose a threat to human health, but the significance of
that threat may not become apparent for years. Although it is generally considered
a British problem, BSE is almost certainly a natural disease of cattle, so
it is undoubtedly found in other countries as well. The normal incidence of
BSE is vanishingly small, however. The <A

Agriculture</A> claims that BSE has not been identified in any U.S. cattle."

<P>-<I>Alex Chernavsky, New York City</I>

<P><A HREF="http://www.nemc.org/refguide/provider/StuartBLevyMD.html">Stuart B.
Levy</A> is a professor of medicine at the Tufts University School of
Medicine in Boston and the author of <I>The Antibiotic Paradox: How Miracle
Drugs are Destroying the Miracle</I> (Plenum, 1992). He replies:

<P>"The problem of resistance actually has been discussed and raised probably
for at least the past 20 to 30 years. In 1981, as the result of a meeting in
Santa Domingo on resistance, an international organization was established:
the Alliance for the Prudent Use of Antibiotics (for those interested in
contacting this organization, their mailing address is P.O. Box 1372,
Boston, MA 02117). The Alliance, which has a presence in 93 countries, was
founded to combat the drug-resistant infectious diseases becoming prevalent
in developing countries. At the time, drug resistance already posed a
substantial threat in those countries, and people felt a tremendous need to
call attention to the danger. It may seem that concerns about drug
resistance have only surfaced recently, however, because it has taken longer
for the problem to reach the developed world, especially the U.S.

<P>"Years of misuse of antibiotics led to the emergence of infectious bacteria
that are resistant not just to one but to many antibiotics. As a result,
there are strains of bacteria today for which we have only one effective
drug treatment or, in some cases, none at all. For the first time since the
discovery of antibiotics, patients in the U.S. are dying of bacterial
infections that cannot be treated. The other half of the problem is that
medical researchers have not found any fundamentally new antibiotics in the
past decade, and we do not expect the discovery of any in the near
future--we must rely on the ones we currently have. That limitation is why
many of us consider this a true public health crisis. Resistance has been a
critical factor in the appearance of 'reemerging infections.' We can no
longer effectively treat some diseases that we were treating easily just
five to 10 years ago. 

<P>"Many of the people writing about the resistance problem now have firsthand
experience of the problem. Once they became aware that bacteria are no
longer succumbing to treatment, they asked why, and pretty soon there was a
media blitz about the risk of drug-resistant diseases. Another reason for
the growing awareness is that antibiotic-resistant bacteria have become an
everyday problem for people in the community; previously it was confined to
very sick people in the hospitals. 

<P>"Why are resistant strains more likely to appear if we do not complete a
course of treatment? Bacterial infections are caused by hundreds of millions
of bacteria, which are not all the same. Some are more susceptible to the
antibiotic than others, and the bacteria reside in different parts of the
body, some more sheltered than others. Each antibiotic treatment takes care
of the most susceptible and exposed bacteria. An incomplete course of
treatment will leave behind those that were in a safe place and those that,
by mutation, happened to have some level of resistance. 

<P>"When that population reestablishes itself, you will again have a large
number of bacteria throughout the body, but they are less susceptible to the
drug. Consequently, there is a greater likelihood that you will have a
population that possesses some resistance to the antibiotic. A full dose of
antibiotic keeps diminishing the bacterial population, which allows your
body to clean up the modest remnant population. If you stop taking the
medicine, the population can increase and re-create the infection, so that
the bacteria can then be passed along to others. Those bacteria then can go
on to become even more resistant."

<P><A HREF="http://www.creighton.edu/Microbio/Bittner.html">Marvin J. Bittner</A>, a staff physician at the
Omaha VA Medical Center and an associate professor at Creighton University
School of Medicine, adds some information and an alternative description of
the dangers of incomplete treatment:

<P>"During the 1940s, attempts to treat tuberculosis with only one drug failed;
the result was the emergence of resistance. During the 1950s, hospital
nurseries were swept by epidemics of penicillin-resistant <A
HREF="http://photon.phol.cwru.edu/som/academic/other/Staphhome.html">staphylococci</A>.
By the 1970s, penicillin-resistant <A
HREF="http://bugs.uah.ualberta.ca//webbug/bactbug/gcintro.htm">gonorrhea</A>
had spread around the world. 

<P>In the 1990s, we have special concern for two
problems: (1) Enterococci have emerged that are <A
HREF="http://www.uhl.uiowa.edu/pubs/hotline/9606/vancomycin.html">resistant
to the drug vancomycin</A>. There are no reliable alternative treatments,
and there is fear that the resistance gene in the enterococci could spread to
more common bacteria, such as staphylococci. (2) The appearance of <A
HREF="http://uhs.bsd.uchicago.edu/uhs/topics/resist.tb.bib.html">multidrug
resistant tuberculosis</A>. Tuberculosis can spread easily and it is deadly;
it was the number one cause of death in the U.S. in 1900, and it is still
the leading cause of death by infectious disease worldwide. Treatment
success drops from nearly 100 percent for the older strains to barely half
that for the drug-resistant ones.

<P>"Any population of bacteria may contain some resistant individuals. Taking a
partial treatment course will kill off the susceptible bacteria at first,
but it leaves behind the tougher ones. If you take a long course and kill
more bacteria, only a few will be left. The patient's own immune system can
mop them up. If you take a short course and do not kill many of the
bacteria, however, there will be a lot left--too many for the patient's
immune system to finish off--so the resistant ones have a chance to grow.
Also, a partial course leaves more bacteria alive at the end of therapy. As
the antibiotic levels in the body decline, they pass through a phase in
which the concentrations are high enough to kill some bacteria but not high
enough to stop the tougher ones. At this point, those remaining tougher
germs have an advantage because they do not have to compete with the weaker
(now dead) ones. This opening gives the resistant bacteria a chance to grow
and flourish."

<P>And <A HREF="http://www.life.uiuc.edu/biotech/people/Salyers.html">Abigail
Salyers</A> in the department of microbiology at the University of Illinois
has provided this extensive overview and a somewhat different perspective on
the problem:

<P>"One answer to the first part of this question is that the use of
antibiotics has not been constant over the period since antibiotics were
discovered, but it has increased drastically in recent years. Antibiotics
were first introduced into clinical use in the 1940s and 1950s. At first,
they were used mainly to treat existing infections. Clinicians soon learned,
however, that administering antibiotics before surgery (prophylactic use)
could prevent infections, and prophylactic use of antibiotics became
widespread. Even in cases where prophylactic use has been shown not to be
efficacious, the tendency has been to continue the practice 'just in case.'

<P>The uses of antibiotics continued to multiply. Dermatologists discovered
that long-term, low-dose administration of certain antibiotics was
beneficial in the treatment of acne and other skin conditions. Animal
scientists discovered that some antibiotics promoted growth of livestock
animals. They are also used extensively in aquaculture to prevent infections
that arise readily in crowded fish or crustacean populations. Because the
selective pressure for antibiotic-resistant strains increases as antibiotic
use increases, it is not surprising that the incidence of antibiotic strains
has increased more rapidly in recent years. 

<P>"The type of selection has also changed. Bacteria exposed to concentrations
of antibiotics too low to kill them, especially if exposure occurs over long
periods, are much more likely to develop and fix the mutations that make
them resistant than are bacteria exposed to high concentrations of
antibiotics, which kill them before they can mutate. As the use of
antibiotics has increased, opportunities for long-term, low-dose exposure
have also increased. In the early days of antibiotics, when antibiotics were
used primarily for therapy of existing infections, hospital staff members
and hospital patients who were not using antibiotics had very little
exposure to antibiotics. 

<P>Today, especially in intensive care wards, the
amount of antibiotics in the environment can become high enough that people
in the vicinity of patients receiving antibiotics are exposed continuously
to low levels of antibiotics. If these people are asymptomatic carriers of
bacterial pathogens (which is not uncommon in hospital settings), the
bacteria they carry experience the type of antibiotic exposure that is
conducive to development of resistant strains. This phenomenon may explain
why the most resistant strains are now arising in hospitals. A similar
situation probably occurs in agricultural settings in which antibiotics are
added daily to animal feed.

<P>"The drastically increased use of antibiotics has certainly accelerated the
appearance of resistant strains. Yet there is another aspect of this issue
that deserves mention. A reader of the popular press is likely to carry away
the impression that the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is a
recent phenomenon. That is not the case. The first published report of a
penicillin-resistant strain appeared in the 1940s, shortly after penicillin
began to be used clinically. In the intervening years, there have been many
reports of resistant bacteria, and surveys have shown a steady increase in
the number of resistant strains. Even during the 1960s, reports of bacterial
strains resistant to multiple antibiotics were becoming commonplace. Yet
most physicians and medical policymakers dismissed such reports as
unimportant because new antibiotics were constantly appearing on the market,
and these new antibiotics allowed physicians to keep ahead of the resistant
strains.

<P>"A major contributor to the current crisis was the widespread attitude
during the 1970s that bacterial resistance to antibiotics was not a serious
medical problem, nor was it likely to become so, because new antibiotics
would continue to appear in time to replace those made obsolete by bacterial
resistance mechanisms. Unfortunately, there was a serious flaw in this rosy
projection. Already in the 1970s, it was becoming more and more difficult to
find new antibiotics. Development of a new one therefore has become
increasingly expensive for the pharmaceutical companies. 

<P>New requirements
for more and larger clinical trials prior to licensing of an antibiotic
further increased the cost of bringing a new drug to market. The result was
that the companies began to cut back on their antibiotic discovery programs
and to focus instead on more profitable drugs. It now takes at least 10
years to bring an antibiotic from the discovery stage to the market, so
decisions made during the 1970s and 1980s are having their most profound
effect on today's medical treatment. Few new antibiotics are now in the
pipeline, whereas antibiotic resistance among bacteria is increasing faster
than ever. So the current perception of a crisis in antibiotic resistance is
not just a matter of an increase in multiply resistant strains of bacteria
but also of the reduced availability of new antibiotics to take care of
resistant strains.

<P>"Overuse and abuse of antibiotics by physicians is the main cause of the
antibiotic resistance crisis. Understandably, however, physicians do not
wish to take all the blame for what could become a major public relations
disaster--if fears about the impending 'loss of antibiotics' prove to be
justified. This has led to the search for others to share the blame. A
popular candidate is the patient who demands antibiotics even when they are
inappropriate or the patient who does not take antibiotics as prescribed. 

<P>"It is true that failure of tuberculosis patients to take antibiotics as
prescribed has played a major role in the emergence of multiply resistant
strains of the bacterium that causes tuberculosis. In this case, patients
were taking the antibiotics sporadically over long periods, a practice that
led to chronic exposure of bacteria to doses of antibiotics too low to eradicate
them--a prime selective environment for resistant strains. Therapeutic
regimens of antibiotics are designed to expose the bacteria to high doses of
antibiotics that eradicate the bacteria from the body, either by killing
them directly or by helping the immune system to clear them. If a patient
stops taking an antibiotic prematurely and there are still bacteria in the
body, the period during which the concentration of antibiotic in circulation
falls gradually to zero allows bacteria to experience the sublethal
concentrations of antibiotic that tend to select for resistant strains. 

<P>"This type of patient misuse of an antibiotic is not, however, the one most
conducive to selection of resistant strains. It is the sporadic use of
antibiotics--for example, taking one pill a day instead of the prescribed
three or four--that provides the optimum setting for the development of
resistant strains. Most people agree that failure of patients to take
antibiotics as prescribed is probably a minor factor in the development of
resistant strains compared with the overuse of antibiotics in crowded
settings such as modern hospitals, where selective pressure for resistance
is constant and where transmission of resistant strains to staff members and
patients is most likely to occur."

<P>"The answer to your question about the purpose of Immunoglobulin

cells bearing the specific receptors for IgE (known as Fc

role in resisting ticks of the Ixodid family, which carry among
other diseases the organisms for Lyme disease and erlichiosis.
But the exact workings of IgE remain far from fully understood."

Szczeklik</A>, chairman of the department of medicine at the
Jagiellonian University School of Medicine in Krakow, Poland,
adds his perspective:

<P>"Immunoglobulin E (IgE) plays a key role in allergy. As a
result, its other functions have received little attention. I
would like to point out two little-appreciated, IgE-related
phenomena that might be of benefit to humans:

<P>"1) Atopics--that is, persons who produce too much IgE--have a
mild hemostatic imbalance, meaning that their blood takes longer
than usual to clot (roughly one fifth of Europeans and North
Americans are atopics). Therefore, the bleeding time among
atopics is slightly, but significantly, prolonged; the imbalance
also reduces the stickiness of the blood platelets and delays
the generation of thrombin, the key enzyme for coagulation.
These phenomena might be relevant in the dangerous situations
triggered by blood clotting in the arteries: a sudden cardiac
arrest precipitated by coronary thrombosis (blockade of vessels
that provide blood to the heart muscle) is a good example. In a
recent study of 385 patients who had heart attacks, sudden
cardiac arrest was far less common among the patients who
entered the hospital with high serum IgE levels than among those
whose IgE was not elevated. It therefore seems possible that
high IgE, by depressing blood clotting, protect atopics against
sudden cardiac arrest.

<P>"2) Tissue injury characteristically results in a marked,
transient rise in IgE levels in the blood. This phenomenon has
been observed following heart attacks, surgery, burns, pulmonary
thromboembolism and major trauma. Hence, IgE seems to be a part
of the mechanism involved in acute-phase response. IgE might
modulate the response to tissue injury through its powerful
interaction with the cells of the immune system, such as mast
cells, macrophages and eosinophils. Such hypotheses need further
experimental verification, however."

"How close are we to developing an effective gene therapy for
treating cancer? Are there any other ways to strike at the
fundamental mechanisms that trigger growth of cancer cells?"
</A></B></FONT>

<P>-<I>Seth Zbar, Iowa City, Ia.</I>

<P>Bruce S. Jacobson, a molecular biologist and cancer researcher at the
University of Massachusetts at Amherst, sent in the following reply:

<P>"To answer these questions, one has to divide cancers into two groups: solid
tumors that require the development of a blood supply to metastasize and enlarge,
and soft tumors that may have circulating cells, as in leukemias.

<P>"Almost half the deaths from cancers result from lung and breast cancer, both
of which are solid tumors. Gene therapy has found very little success in treating
these types of cancers. If you are going to try to change the genetic makeup of
the cancer cells by inserting genes, you must first get the genes to the cancer
cells. Currently direct injection of genes into the cancer mass is being
attempted, but it is unlikely that it will work because all the cells must be
hit, which is very unlikely.

<P>"Most cancers kill their victims by metastasis, wherein cancerous cells move
from the primary site to other places in the body. It would be almost impossible
to inject genes directly into all these sites. Furthermore, a cancer is not made
up of only one type of rapidly, uncontrolled growing cell but has many different
types of cells, some of which might not respond to the gene you wish to insert.
Gene therapy within the next decade or so is not  going to prove very effective
in eliminating solid cancers such as lung, breast, prostate, colon and so on.
There has been limited success with cancers where cells are circulating in the
bloodstream or even in the bone marrow; these cancers are relatively few in
number, although they do claim many lives every year. It is in these cases, I
think, that gene therapy has the best chance of working.

<P>"Are there other new therapies? Yes! At present, the majority are adjunct
therapies to existing chemotherapy treatments. Most cancers must develop a blood
supply to continue growth beyond a few millimeters in size. Nutrients and oxygen
carried in the blood must be delivered to the cancer, and wastes must be
removedQotherwise the cancer cells, like any other cells in a tissue, will die.
Without a blood supply, cancer cells do not effectively metastasize to other
organs and thereby kill the patient. Medical researchers are now testing many
therapeutic agents intended to prevent blood supply to tumors. Some of these
agents appear to halt cancer growth, which would then allow conventional
chemotherapy treatments to work more effectively.

<P>"Another approach being explored in my <A
HREF="http://klaatu.oit.umass.edu/pubaffs/science_news/press/bomb.html">lab</A>
and in a couple of others involves identifying molecules that are found only on
the surface of the blood vessels feeding the cancers (and not on the surface of
blood vessels in normal tissues). Once these molecules are identified, they can
be used as 'zip codes' to address various therapeutic agents only to the cancer
or to send agents to block the blood supply to the cancer without killing the
surrounding, normal cells. Furthermore, using the specific molecules on the
surface of the cancer blood vessels to target therapeutic agents raises the
possibility of using the same molecules to target agents to the cancer cells as
well. It may even be possible to modify the cancer blood vessel cells to secrete
factors that would inhibit cancer cell growth.

<P>"I have great hopes for the targeting approach. My colleagues and I recently
wrote a short review of the approach, published in the April 1996, issue of <A
HREF="http://medicine.nature.com/">Nature Medicine</A>.

Jim Mixson of the University of Maryland School of Medicine also provided a
two-part answer to the question:

<P>"Regarding the first part of the question, gene therapy is approaching
clinical realization for the treatment of neoplastic and metabolic diseases.
Although currently there are no FDA-approved gene therapy products, an effective
gene therapy will probably gain FDA approval within the next three to five years.
There are now more than 100 gene therapy clinical trials aimed toward cancer,
genetic diseases (such as ADA deficiency, cystic fibrosis and hemophilia A),
infectious diseases (including AIDS) and autoimmune diseases (such as rheumatoid
arthritis). Because of the urgent needs of a large number of cancer patients,
most of these gene therapy trials are directed against cancer.

<P>"Gene therapy approaches fall into two main categories: (1) the transfer of a
gene that stimulates the immune system and (2) the insertion of genes within the
tumor that sensitizes the tumor to a relatively nontoxic 'prodrug.' Both these
approaches show a great deal of promise."

<P>The second part of Mixson's answer echoes the research described by Jacobson:

<P>"Therapies that inhibit tumors' blood vessel development also seem to have
considerable merit. Blood vessel development is technically known as
angiogenesis, so the drugs that inhibit this process are called antiangiogenic.
These antiangiogenic drugs include antibiotic derivatives, peptides (small
protein fragments) and peptide derivatives. Many of the peptides being tested
have been isolated from proteins that are secreted by tumors. Blood vessel
development is critical for the growth of any solid tumor, such as breast, colon
or lung cancer. Thus, any therapy that can inhibit the tumors' blood supply
should be effective against multiple types of tumors. This area of research is
receiving a good deal of attention, and there are already clinical trials in this
field."

"If a diet of caloric
restriction can extend the life span of laboratory rats, then does the lifestyle
of an athlete, who burns calories at a rapid rate, hasten the aging process?"
</A></B></FONT>

<P>-<I>Terence Cross, Dublin, Ireland</I>

<P>Barbara C. Hansen, professor of physiology in the School of Medicine at the
University of Maryland and director of the university's Obesity and Diabetes
Research Center, responded as follows:

<P>"The effects of caloric restriction on life span in mammals have been
demonstrated only among rodents. At present, there are no studies that can
definitively say whether caloric restriction extends life span in any primate, so
it is premature to draw conclusions about the possibility of extending the
maximal human life span.

<P>"We are currently researching caloric restriction in nonhuman primates
(monkeys). Our monkey study has been going on for 13 years. We began the study on
young adult monkeys, equivalent to humans 20 to 25 years old. The animals were
placed on a weight-control regimen, designed so they could not put on middle-age
weight. We set a monkey's caloric intake for each week based on whether he has
gained or lost weight since the previous week.

<P>"There are two key issues under study here: Does the average monkey live
longer, and is the maximal life span of the monkeys extended? For rodents,
caloric restriction has been shown to extend both average and maximal life span.
For monkeys, we already know that the animals in our group are living longer than
average, if you judge by the 50 percent death point (the time at which half of
the animals in the group have died). We have also observed general improvements
in health and decreases in disease, which are likely to translate into longer
lives. For example, restricting the caloric intake of a monkey sufficiently to
prevent the onset of middle-age obesity completely prevents type II diabetes,
even though these animals are prone to diabetes.

<P>"What we do not know is the effect on maximal life span. Will the
longest-lived calorie-restricted monkey survive longer than any other monkey has
survived? The monkeys in the University of Maryland study are now at an age
equivalent to that of 50- to 60-year-old humans, so we won't know the answer to
that question for another 10 to 15 years; monkeys are thought to live well into
their thirties under laboratory conditions.

<P>"There are two other, related primate studies under way. Richard Weindruch
started a similar one at the University of Wisconsin about five year after our
own. George Roth and Mark Lane are running a slightly different program at the <A
HREF="http://www.senior.com/npo/nia.html">National Institute on Aging</A>. Roth
and Lane are working with several groups of monkeys; they started some of the
monkeys on a program of caloric restriction before the animals reached adulthood.
This study will produce the best data on the effects of early caloric
restriction. It is not yet clear whether early caloric restriction has a net
positive or negative influence on health.

<P>"We do know enough to say that caloric restriction to prevent obesity during
adulthood is likely to be very beneficial, to humans as well as to monkeys.
Nobody knows whether the health benefits are because of the positive effects of
not having excess adipose tissue or because of altered metabolic activity. My
colleagues and I just finished a paper showing that caloric restriction increases
the efficiency with which the body burns calories. The problem is, we do not know
how that change occurs--that is what we are studying right now.

<P>"Incidentally, there is no evidence that excessive leanness is healthy. In
fact, most evidence shows that there is an increased mortality associated with
excessive leanness. It seems that there is an increasing risk of disease and risk
at both ends of the weight range, though probably for different reasons.

<P>"Turning back to the original question, we must consider several issues
separate from caloric restriction. The lifestyle of an athlete would normally
extend life span because it would involve exercise, a healthy diet, absence of
obesity, absence of smoking and absence of alcohol and drug abuse (one would
hope!). Such behaviors reduce the risk of various diseases, including
cardiovascular disease. The athletic lifestyle won't necessarily cause you to
live to 100, but it might extend your life span from, say, 70 to 80.

<P>"The rapid rate at which an athlete burns calories is not associated with
either an increase or decrease in life span. There is, in fact, a theory that
animals have only a fixed number of calories to burn during their life, but it is
pure speculation, intended to explain why calorie-restricted rodents live longer.
There is no evidence that an enhanced turnover rate of calories hastens the aging
process. Based on our current level of knowledge, we would expect athletes to
have longer or at least healthier lives than they would if they were not
athletic.

<P>"Exercise, diet and genotype all interact in complicated ways. Despite all our
attempts to take our destinies into our own hands, genes seem to play a
significant role in determining life span, susceptibility to disease and probably

"Is there a biochemical
test that accurately diagnoses bipolar disorder? I heard on the radio today that
millions of people in the U.S. have bipolar disorder and that 75 per cent of them
are undiagnosed and untreated." </A></B></FONT>

<P>-<I>James R. Spradling, Oro Valley, Arizona</I>

<P>The following response comes from Fred Petty, the director of the Mental
Health Clinic at the Dallas Veterans Administration Medical Center and profesor
of psychiatry at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School:

<P>"The current best estimate is that adult lifetime prevalence of bipolar
disorder in the U.S. is about 1 percent for severe cases and 2 to 3 percent if
milder cases are included--cases that would include <A
HREF="http://www.mentalhealth.com/dis/p20-md03.html">cyclothymia</A> and 'bipolar
2.' Given the population of the U.S. (about 250 million), those numbers translate
into about two to three million with severe bipolar disorder and some five to
seven million total, including those with mild symptoms. So the figures you heard
on the radio seem reasonable.

<P>"I have seen estimates that two thirds to three quarters of the people with
depression are undiagnosed and untreated. I haven't seen the corresponding
statistics for bipolar disorder, but I would say that, looking at mood disorders
overall, most patients are still undiagnosed and untreated.

<P>"Right now the diagnosis of bipolar disorder is a clinical diagnosis, which
means it is made by a physician based on information about the patient's
symptoms, mental status and medical history. It is important that people obtain a
medical evaluation, because there are some conditions, such as thyroid disease,
which can mimic the symptoms of bipolar disorder.

<P>"There is, at present, no routinely available biochemical diagnostic tests for
bipolar disorder. My laboratory has published some work looking at the blood
levels of an amino acid called GABA (gamma amino butyric acid), which functions
as a neurotransmitter in the brain. Bipolar patients often show low levels of
GABA in the bloodstream. The GABA test is currently used only for research
purposes; GABA levels appear abnormal only in about one third of the patients who
are bipolar. Also, this test is not specific for bipolar, because low GABA levels
are also found in people exhibiting non- bipolar depression.

<P>"One of the likely reasons that GABA is not a universal indicator is that
bipolar disorder is heterogeneous. In other words, the syndrome we call 'bipolar'
actually results from several different causal conditions (etiologies); it is
possible that in some cases the low GABA level is the predominant etiology, but
not in all. In this sense, bipolar is somewhat like diarrhea--we call it one
thing, but you can get it a variety of ways (through colitis, food poisoning, and
so on)--or like heart failure, which has a multiple etiology. But low GABA
readings look useful because the anomaly persists even after the person improves
clinically. If my group can get its grants renewed, we would like to look at GABA
levels in children whose parents have bipolar disorder.

<P>"There is also some very interesting work being done with PET scans, which can
show deficits of the neurotransmitter serotonin in the brain, associated with
depression. Serotonin deficits seem to persist even after the depression
lifts--suggesting that it is a real biological marker. PET scans of serotonin in
bipolar patients have not yet been done, to my knowledge. Brain imaging using
magnetic resonance has been applied to bipolar research; some bipolar patients
show brain lesions in these images.

<P>"Another very exciting area of investigation involves the search for a genetic
locus for bipolar illness. Bipolar is probably the most genetic of all
psychiatric illnesses, and psychiatric illnesses in general have a strong genetic
component. If you have one parent with the illness, you face a 25 percent risk;
if both parents are bipolar, you face a 50 percent risk. Among identical twins,
there is an 80 percent concordance for bipolar disorder. Ideally, we would like
to diagnose the illness in young people before they express any severe symptoms.
In this way, we could save a lot of human suffering; the earlier a patient gets
into treatment, the better the prognosis."

"Do scientists regularly check the speed of light or
other constants of physics to make sure that their values always
stay the same? Is it possible that the speed of light might
"hiccup" occasionally or slowly change over time?"
</A></B></FONT>

<P>--<I>Ray Simon<br> Ludlow Mass.</I>

<P>Robert Ehrlich in the <a
href="http://www.physics.gmu.edu/"TARGET="_top">physics department</a> of
George Mason University responds:

<P>"Scientists do continually try to measure the constants of
physics, but the usual motivation is to get more precise values,
rather than to check whether those values have changed. If you
had a technique to measure the speed of light that was no better
than one that was previously used, you might not bother to make
another measurement unless there were some reason to believe the
previous value was in error. Moreover, if you did measure the
speed of light and got an anomalous value, the odds are good
that you would conclude that you had made a mistake in the
measurement, rather than that the speed of light 'hiccuped' that
particular day. State-of-the-art measurement techniques are
extremely complex and require all sorts of checks to be sure
they have been performed correctly. If in fact the constants of
nature were changing, it would be very difficult to know how
precise your experiment needed to be to detect such a change,
unless you had some way of estimating the expected rate of
change. Random, occasional hiccups in the constants almost
certainly would go undetected.

<P>"The physicist <a
href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Dirac.html"TARGET="_top">Paul
A. M. Dirac</a> once suggested that the universal gravitational
constant, G, that measures the strength of attraction every
particle of matter feels for every other particle was actually
weakening with time, in proportion to the age of the universe
since the big bang. According to Dirac's theory, the force of
gravity would be only half as strong in 10 billion years as it
is today. Given this specific prediction of the rate of
weakening, scientists could make a specific test. The moon's
distance from the earth is understood to be slowly increasing
because of its tidal interaction with the earth (as tidal
friction slows the rotation of the earth, the size of the moon's
orbit must increase to conserve the total angular moment of the
earth-moon system). If gravity were growing weaker with time,
the moon would recede from the earth even faster than
conventional theory predicted. Precise timing measurement of
laser pulses from the earth bounced off reflectors that the
Apollo astronauts left on the moon shows that the moon is indeed
slowly receding but only at the expected rate, not the faster
one Dirac's theory would imply."<P>

"What causes the noise emitted from high-voltage power lines--is it static
discharge, vibration from the 60-cycle field or something else entirely?"
</A></B></FONT>

<P>--<I>Roy Kappesser<BR> Concord, Calif.</I>

<P>Robert Dent, president of the <a href="http://engine.ieee.org/power/"TARGET="_top">IEEE
Power Engineering Society</a>, responds:

<P>"The audible noise emitted from high-voltage lines is caused by the discharge
of energy that occurs when the electrical field strength on the conductor surface
is greater than the 'breakdown strength' (the field intensity necessary to start
a flow of electric current) of the air surrounding the conductor. This discharge
is also responsible for radio noise, a visible glow of light near the conductor,
an energy loss known as corona loss and other phenomena associated with
high-voltage lines.

<P>"The degree or intensity of the corona discharge and the resulting audible
noise are affected by the condition of the air--that is, by humidity, air
density, wind and water in the form of rain, drizzle and fog. Water increases the
conductivity of the air and so increases the intensity of the discharge. Also,
irregularities on the conductor surface, such as nicks or sharp points and
airborne contaminants, can increase the corona activity. Aging or weathering of
the conductor surface generally reduces the significance of these factors.

<P>"The higher voltages at which modern transmission lines operate have increased
the noise problem to the point to which they have become a concern to the power
industry. Consequently, these lines are now designed, constructed and maintained
so that during dry conditions they will operate below the corona-inception
voltage, meaning that the line will generate a minimum of corona-related noise.
In foul weather conditions, however, corona discharges can be produced by water
droplets, fog and snow." <P>

"What exactly is the 'spin' of subatomic particles such as electrons and protons?
Does it have any physical significance, analogous to the spin of a planet?"
</A></B></FONT>

<P>--<I>Tim Whelan<BR>Peculiar, Miss.</I>

<P>Translating concepts from the quantum realm to the "classical"
world of everyday experience is not easy. Several scientists
have taken up the challenge, however.

<P><A HREF="http://noether.vassar.edu/Tavel.html"TARGET="_top">Morton Tavel</A>,
a professor of physics at Vassar College, responds:

<P>"When certain elementary particles move through a magnetic
field, they are deflected in a manner that suggests they have
the properties of little magnets. In the classical world, a
charged, spinning object has magnetic properties that are very
much like those exhibited by these elementary particles.
Physicists love analogies, so they described the elementary
particles too in terms of their 'spin.'

<P>"Unfortunately, the analogy breaks down, and we have come to
realize that it is misleading to conjure up an image of the
electron as a small spinning object. Instead we have learned
simply to accept the observed fact that the electron is
deflected by magnetic fields. If one insists on the image of a
spinning object, then real paradoxes arise; unlike a tossed
softball, for instance, the spin of an electron never changes,
and it has only two possible orientations. In addition, the very
notion that electrons and protons are solid 'objects' that can
'rotate' in space is itself difficult to sustain, given what we
know about the rules of quantum mechanics. The term 'spin,'
however, still remains."

<P><A HREF="http://panther.bsc.edu/~ktbachma/"TARGET="_top">Kurt T. Bachmann</A>
of Birmingham-Southern College adds some historical background
and other details:

<P>"Starting in the 1920s, Otto Stern and Walther Gerlach of the
University of Hamburg in Germany conducted a series of important
atomic beam experiments. Knowing that all moving charges produce
magnetic fields, they proposed to measure the magnetic fields
produced by the electrons orbiting nuclei in atoms. Much to
their surprise, however, the two physicists found that electrons
themselves act as if they are spinning very rapidly, producing
tiny magnetic fields independent of those from their orbital
motions. Soon the terminology 'spin' was used to describe this
apparent rotation of subatomic particles.

<P>"Spin is a bizarre physical quantity. It is analogous to the
spin of a planet in that it gives a particle angular momentum
and a tiny magnetic field called a magnetic moment. Based on the
known sizes of subatomic particles, however, the surfaces of
charged particles would have to be moving faster than the speed
of light in order to produce the measured magnetic moments.
Furthermore, spin is quantized, meaning that only certain
discrete spins are allowed. This situation creates all sorts of
complications that make spin one of the more challenging aspects
of quantum mechanics.

<P>"In a broader sense, spin is an essential property influencing
the ordering of electrons and nuclei in atoms and molecules,
giving it great physical significance in chemistry and
solid-state physics. Spin is likewise an essential consideration
in all interactions among subatomic particles, whether in
high-energy particle beams, low-temperature fluids or the
tenuous flow of particles from the sun known as the solar wind.
Indeed, many if not most physical processes, ranging from the
smallest nuclear scales to the largest astrophysical distances,
depend greatly on interactions of subatomic particles and the
spins of those particles."

<P><A HREF="http://www.phys.hawaii.edu/vjs/www/vjs.html"TARGET="_top">Victor J.
Stenger</A>, professor of physics at the University of Hawaii at
Manoa, offers another, more technical perspective:

<P>"Spin is the total angular momentum, or <I>intrinsic</I> angular
momentum, of a body. The spins of elementary particles are
analogous to the spins of macroscopic bodies. In fact, the spin
of a planet is the sum of the spins and the orbital angular
momenta of all its elementary particles. So are the spins of
other composite objects such as atoms, atomic nuclei and protons
(which are made of quarks).

<P>"In classical physics, angular momentum is a continuous
variable. In quantum mechanics, angular momenta are discrete,
quantized in units of Planck's constant divided by 4 pi. <A
HREF="http://www.chembio.uoguelph.ca/educmat/chm386/rudiment/tourquan/bohr.htm"TARGET="_top">Niels
Bohr</A> proposed that angular momentum is quantized in 1913 and
used this to explain the line spectrum of hydrogen.

<P>"At our current level of understanding, the elementary particles
are quarks, leptons (such as the electron) and bosons (such as
the photon). These particles are all imagined as pointlike, so
you might wonder how they can have spins. A simple answer might
be, perhaps they are composite, too. But deep theoretical
reasons having to do with the rotational symmetry of nature lead
to the existence of spins for elementary objects and to their
quantization. Of particular significance is the difference
between fermions, particles that, like the electron, have
half-integer spins (half-integer multiples of Planck's constant
divided by 2 pi), and bosons, particles that have integer spins.
Fermions obey the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that
two identical fermions cannot exist in the same state; without
the Pauli exclusion principle, chemistry would have no Periodic
Table. Bosons, on the other hand, tend to congregate in the same
state, leading to phenomena such as superconductivity and
Bose-Einstein condensation.

<P>"Spin has served as the prototype for other, even more abstract
notions that seem to have the mathematical properties of angular
momentum but do not have a simple classical analogue. For
example, isotopic spin is used in nuclear physics to represent
the two states of a 'nucleon,' the proton and neutron.
Similarly, quarks are paired as isospin 'up' and 'down,' which
are the names given to the two quarks that make up ordinary
matter. The rotational symmetry of space and time is generalized
to include symmetries in more abstract 'inner' dimensions, with
the result that much of the complex structure of the microworld
can be seen as resulting from symmetry breaking, connecting
profoundly to ideas describing the spontaneous formation of
structure in the macroworld."

"What exactly is the Higgs boson? Have physicists proved that it really exists?"
</A></B></FONT>

<P>--<I>Francisco Pires<br> Lisbon, Portugal</I>

<P>Stephen Reucroft in the Elementary Particle Physics group at  Northeastern
University gives this introductory reply:

<P>"Over the past few decades, particle physicists have developed an elegant
theoretical model (the Standard Model) that gives a framework for our current
understanding of the fundamental particles and forces of nature. One major
ingredient in this model is a hypothetical, ubiquitous quantum field that is
supposed to be responsible for giving particles their masses (this field would
answer the basic question of why particles have the masses they do--or indeed,
why they have any mass at all). This field is called the Higgs field. As a
consequence of wave-particle duality, all quantum fields have a fundamental
particle associated with them. The particle associated with the Higgs field is
called the Higgs boson.

<P>"Because the Higgs field would be responsible for mass, the very fact that the
fundamental particles do have mass is regarded by many physicists as an
indication of the existence of the Higgs field. We can even take all our data on
particle physics data and interpret them in terms of the mass of a hypothetical
Higgs boson. In other words, if we assume that the Higgs boson exists, we can
infer its mass based on the effect it would have on the properties of other
particles and fields. We have not yet truly proved that the Higgs boson exists,
however. One of the main aims of particle physics over the next couple of decades
is to prove once and for all the existence or nonexistence of the Higgs boson."

<P>Another, more extensive response comes from <A HREF="http://physics.ucsc.
edu/people/personal/haber.html">Howard Haber</A> and <A HREF="http://
physics.ucsc.edu/people/personal/dine.html">Michael Dine</A>, both of whom are
professors of physics at the <A HREF="http://scipp.ucsc.edu/">Santa Cruz
Institute for Particle Physics</A> at the University of California at Santa Cruz:

<P>"Much of today's research in elementary particle physics focuses on the search
for a particle called the Higgs boson. This particle is the one missing piece of
our present understanding of the laws of nature, known as the Standard Model.
This model describes three types of forces: electromagnetic interactions, which
cause all phenomena associated with electric and magnetic fields and the spectrum
of electromagnetic radiation; strong interactions, which bind atomic nuclei; and
the weak nuclear force, which governs beta decay--a form of natural
radioactivity--and hydrogen fusion, the source of the sun's energy. (The Standard
Model does not describe the fourth force, gravity.)

<P>"In our daily lives, electromagnetism is the most familiar of these forces. Until
relatively recently, it was the only one which we understood well. Since the
1970s, however, scientists have come to understand the strong and weak forces
almost equally well. In the past few years, in high-energy experiments at CERN,
the European laboratory for particle physics, near Geneva and at the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC), physicists have made precision tests of the
Standard Model. It seems to provide a complete description of the natural world
down to scales on the order of one- thousandth the size of an atomic nucleus.

<P>"The Higgs particle is connected with the weak force. Electromagnetism
describes particles interacting with photons, the basic units of the
electromagnetic field. In a parallel way, the modern theory of weak interactions
describes particles (the <I>W</I> and <I>Z</I> particles) interacting with
electrons, neutrinos, quarks and other particles. In many respects, these
particles are similar to photons. But they are also strikingly different. The
photon probably has no mass at all. From experiments, we know that a photon can
be no more massive than a thousand-billion-billion-billionth (10 <sup>-30</sup>)
the mass of an electron, and for theoretical reasons, we believe it has exactly
zero mass. The <I>W</I> and <I>Z</I> particles, however, have enormous masses:
more than 80 times the mass of a proton, one of the constituents of an atomic
nucleus.

<P>"The huge masses of the <I>W</I> and <I>Z</I> particles is a puzzle. If one
simply postulates that these particles interact with the known elementary
particles and have a large mass, the theory is inconsistent. ( For example, the
Standard Model would predict that the probability of two particles having very
high energies colliding with one another would be greater than one, a physical
impossibility!) To fix this problem, there must be additional particles. The
simplest models that explain the masses of the <I>W</I> and <I>Z</I> have only
one such particle: the Higgs boson. There are also other proposals, many of them
more exotic. For instance, there may be several Higgs bosons, entirely new types
of strong interactions and a possible new fundamental physical symmetry, called
supersymmetry.

<P>"If there is a Higgs boson whose mass is less than that of the <I>Z</I> particle,
physicists will discover it over the next two years at the large accelerator in
Geneva known as <A HREF="http://www.cern.ch/CERN/
Divisions/SL/lep2page.html">LEP</A> (the Large Electron Positron collider). LEP
accelerates electrons and their antimatter twins (positrons) to very high
energies, then allows them to collide. If Higgs bosons have larger masses, they
might be unveiled at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Batavia, Ill.,
by the turn of the century. Otherwise we are very likely to find them at a new
accelerator, <A HREF="http://wwwlhc01.cern.ch:8080/lhcpub/Welcome.html">LHC</A>
(the Large Hadron Collider), scheduled to start operation at CERN in 2005.
Discovery of the Higgs boson was one of the principal tasks scheduled for the
Superconducting Super Collider, which the U.S. Congress canceled in 1993.

<P>"In sum, the Higgs boson is a critical ingredient to complete our current
understanding of the Standard Model, the theoretical edifice of particle physics.
Different types of Higgs bosons, if they exist, may lead us into new realms of
physics beyond the Standard Model."

<P>And <A HREF="http://lutece.fnal.gov/">Chris Quigg</A>, a researcher in the
theoretical physics department at <A HREF="http://www.fnal.gov"> Fermi National
Accelerator Laboratory</A>, presents a deep overview:

<P>"The central challenge in particle physics today is to understand what
differentiates electromagnetism from the weak interactions that govern
radioactivity and the energy output of the sun. The fundamental interactions
between particles derive from symmetries that we have observed in nature.

<P>"One of the great recent achievements of modern physics is a quantum field theory
in which weak and electromagnetic interactions are understood to arise from a
common symmetry. This 'electroweak theory' has been validated in detail,
especially by experiments in the LEP Collider at <A HREF="
http://www.cern.ch/">CERN</A>. Although the weak and electromagnetic interactions
are linked through symmetry, their manifestations in the everyday world are very
different. The influence of electromagnetism extends to infinite distances,
whereas the influence of the weak interaction is confined to subnuclear
dimensions, less than about 10<sup>-15</sup> centimeters. This difference is directly
related to the fact that the photon, the force carrier of electromagnetism, is
massless, whereas the <I> W</I> and <I>Z</I> particles, which carry the weak
forces, are about 100 times the mass of the proton.<p>

<P>"What hides the symmetry between the weak and electromagnetic interactions? That
is the question we hope to answer through experiments at the Large Hadron
Collider (LHC) at CERN. When the LHC is commissioned, around the year 2005, it
will enable us to study collisions among quarks at energies approaching 1 TeV, or
 a trillion (10<sup>12)</sup> electron volts. A thorough exploration of the 1-TeV
energy scale will determine the mechanism by which the electroweak symmetry is
hidden and teach us what makes the <I>W</I> and <I>Z</I> particles massive.

<P>"The simplest guess goes back to theoretical work by British physicist Peter
Higgs and others in the 1960s. According to this picture, the giver of mass is a
neutral particle with zero spin that we call the Higgs boson. In today's version
of the electroweak theory, the <I>W</I> and <I>Z</I> particles and all the
fundamental constituents--quarks and leptons--get their masses by interacting
with the Higgs boson. But the Higgs boson remains hypothetical; it has not been
observed. That is why particle physicists often use the search for the Higgs
boson as a shorthand for the campaign to learn the agent that hides electroweak
symmetry and endows other particles with mass.

<P>"If the answer is the Higgs boson, we can say enough about its properties to
guide the search. Unfortunately, the electroweak theory does not predict the mass
of the Higgs boson, although consistency arguments require that it have a mass of
less than 1 TeV. Experimental searches already carried out tell us that the Higgs
must weigh more than about 60 billion electron volts (GeV), or 0.06 TeV.<p>

<P>"If the Higgs is relatively light, it may be seen soon in electron- positron
annihilations at LEP, produced in association with the <i>Z</i>. The Higgs boson
would decay into a <i>b</i> quark and a <i>b</i> antiquark. In a few years,
experiments at Fermilab's <A HREF="http://www.fnal.gov/
acc_tour_tev.html">Tevatron</A> should be able to extend the search to higher
masses, looking for Higgs plus <i>W</i> or Higgs plus <i>Z</i> particles in
collisions between protons and antiprotons. If the Higgs mass exceeds about 130
GeV, our best hope lies with the LHC. Higher-energy electron-positron colliders,
or even muon colliders, could also play an important role.

<P>"Our inability to predict the mass of the Higgs boson is one of the reasons many
of us believe that this picture cannot tell the whole story. We are searching for
extensions to the electroweak theory that make it more coherent and more
predictive. Two of these seem promising. Both of them imply that we will find a
rich harvest of new particles and new phenomena at the high energies we are just
beginning to explore at Fermilab and CERN. One approach is a generalization of
the electroweak theory, called supersymmetry, that associates new particles with
all the known quarks and leptons and force particles. Supersymmetry entails
several Higgs bosons, and one of which probably lies in the energy regime that
LEP is starting to survey. In the other approach, called dynamical symmetry
breaking, the Higgs boson is not an elementary particle but a composite whose
properties we may hope to compute once we understand its constituents and their
interactions.

<P>"Over the next 15 years, we should begin to find a real understanding of the
origin of mass. The interest lies not just in the arcana of accelerator
experiments but suffuses everything in the world around us: mass is what
determines the range of forces and sets the scale of all the structures we see in
nature.

<P>"In 1993 British Science Minister William Waldegrave challenged particle
physicists to explain on a single page what the Higgs boson is and why they are
so eager to find it. He awarded bottles of champagne to the authors of five
winning entries at the annual meeting of the British Association for the
Advancement of Science. The prizewinning papers range from serious to whimsical.

"Are mathematicians finally satisfied with Andrew Wiles's proof of Fermat's Last
Theorem? Why has this theorem been so difficult to prove?"
</A></B></FONT>

<P>--<I>Joe Pinson<BR>Fort Mill, S.C.</I>

<P><A HREF="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/Fermat's_
last_theorem.html"TARGET=_top">Fermat's Last Theorem</A> was until recently the most famous
unsolved problem in mathematics. In the mid-17th century Pierre de Fermat wrote
that no value of n greater than 2 could satisfy the equation " x<SUP>n</SUP> +
y<SUP>n</SUP> = z<SUP>n</SUP>," where n, x, y and z are all integers. He claimed
that he had a simple proof of this theorem, but no record of it has ever been
found. Ever since that time, countless professional and amateur mathematicians
have tried to find a valid proof (and wondered whether Fermat really ever had
one). Then in 1994, Andrew Wiles of <A
HREF="http://www.math.princeton.edu/"TARGET=_top">Princeton University</A> announced that he
had <A HREF="http://www.netspace.org/herald/issues/092995/wiles.
f.html"TARGET=_top">discovered a proof</A> while working on a more general problem in
geometry.

<P><A HREF="http://www.brynmawr.edu/Adm/ABMC/faculty/grundman.html"TARGET=_top">Helen G.
Grundman</A>, associate professor of mathematics at Byrn Mawr College, assesses
the state of that proof:

<P>"I think it's safe to say that, yes, mathematicians are now satisfied with <A
HREF="http://www.best.com/~cgd/home/flt/flt08.htm"TARGET=_top">the proof of Fermat's Last
Theorem</A>. Few, however, would refer to the proof as being Wiles's alone. The
proof is the work of many people. Wiles made a significant contribution and was
the one who pulled the work together into what he thought was a proof. Although
his original attempt turned out to have an error in it, Wiles and his associate
Richard Taylor were able to correct the problem, and so now there is what we
believe to be a correct proof of Fermat's Last Theorem.

<P>"The proof we now know required the development of an entire field of mathematics
that was unknown in Fermat's time. The theorem itself is very easy to state and
so may seem deceptively simple; you do not need to know a lot of mathematics to
understand the problem. It turns out, however, that to the best of our knowledge,
you do need to know a lot of mathematics in order to solve it. It is still an
open question whether there may be a proof of Fermat's Last Theorem that involves
only mathematics and methods that were known in Fermat's time. We have no way of
answering unless someone finds one."

<P>Glenn H. Stevens in the <A HREF="http://math.bu.edu/faculty.html"TARGET=_top"> mathematics
department</A> at Boston University expands on these thoughts:

<P>"Yes, mathematicians are satisfied that Fermat's Last Theorem has been proved.
Andrew Wiles's proof of the 'semistable modularity conjecture'--the key part of
his proof--has been carefully checked and even simplified. It was already known
before Wiles's proof that Fermat's Last Theorem would be a consequence of the
modularity conjecture, combining it with another big theorem due to <A
HREF="http://math.berkeley.edu/~ribet/"TARGET=_top">Ken Ribet</A> and using key ideas from <A
HREF="http://www.uni-essen.de/IEM/people/frey.html"TARGET=_top">Gerhard Frey</A> and
Jean-Pierre Serre.

<P>"I would ask this second question the other way around. How did we get so lucky
as to find a proof at all? The German polymath <A HREF="http://www-
groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Gauss.html"TARGET=_top">Karl Gauss</A> summed
up the attitudes of many pre-1985 professional mathematicians when in 1816 he
wrote: 'I confess that Fermat's Last Theorem, as an isolated proposition, has
very little interest for me, because I could easily lay down a multitude of such
propositions, which one could neither prove nor dispose of.' Somehow we got lucky
and managed to save Fermat's Last Theorem from its isolation by linking it to
some important branches of modern mathematics, especially the theory of modular
forms. Was this really just luck? How many others of Gauss's 'multitude of
propositions' can also be magically transformed and made accessible to the
powerful tools of modern mathematics? Fermat's Last Theorem is just the
beginning. There are many fascinating explorations still ahead of us!"

<P>And <A HREF="http://www.colby.edu/math.cs/fqg/fqg.html"TARGET=_top">Fernando Q. Gouv&ecirca</A>,
chair of the department of mathematics and computer science at Colby College,
offers some additional information:

<P>"The full proof of Fermat's Last Theorem is contained in two papers, one by
Andrew Wiles and one written jointly by Wiles and Richard Taylor, which together
make up the whole of the May 1995 issue of the <A HREF="http://
muse.jhu.edu/journals/aom/index.html"TARGET=_top"><I>Annals of Mathematics</I></A>, a journal
published at Princeton University. Journal publication implies, of course, that
the referees were satisfied that the paper was correct.

<P>"In the summer of 1995, there was a large conference held at Boston University to
go over the details of the proof. Specialists in each of the relevant areas gave
talks explaining both the background and the content of the work of Wiles and
Taylor. After having subjected the proof to such close scrutiny, the mathematical
community feels comfortable that it is correct.

<P>"The second question is much harder to answer. It could very well be, of course,
that the reason the theorem has taken so long to prove is that we have not been
smart enough! But that seems unlikely, seeing that so many brilliant
mathematicians thought about it over the centuries. Why then was the proof so
hard?

<P>"Well, the first thing is that Fermat's Last Theorem is a very sweeping, general
statement: for <I>no</I> exponent <I>n</I> greater than 2 is there a solution to
the Fermat equation. It is much easier to attack the problem for a specific
exponent. In one of his letters, for example, Fermat explains how to prove it for
<I>n</I> = 4; Euler in the 18th century could produce a proof for the case of
<I>n</I> = 3, and so on. In fact, just before Wiles's work, mathematicians had
shown that there are no solutions to the theorem for numbers up to <I>n</I> =
4,000,000 or so. That may seem like a lot of numbers, but of course, it doesn't
even scratch the surface of a claim that talks about <I>every</I> exponent.

<P>"The other problem is that Fermat's claim has always felt, well, marginal. It is
hard to connect the Last Theorem to other parts of mathematics, which means that
powerful mathematical ideas can't necessarily be applied to it. In fact, if one
looks at the history of the theorem, one sees that the biggest advances in
working toward a proof have arisen when some connection to other mathematics was
found. For example, Polish mathematician <A
HREF="http://hkein.ie.cuhk.hk/Education/Math/mactutor/
Mathematicians/Kummer.html"TARGET=_top">Ernst Eduard Kummer</A>'s work in the mid-19th
century arises from connecting the Last Theorem to the theory of cyclotomic
fields. And Wiles is no exception: his proof grows out of work by Frey, Serre and
Ribet that connects Fermat's statement with the theory of elliptic curves. Once
that connection was established, and one knew that proving the Modularity
Conjecture for elliptic curves would yield a proof of Fermat's Last Theorem,
there was reason to be hopeful. Wiles's work shows that such hope was justified."

<P>Many a careless cook has witnessed this startling phenomenon.
Collier N. Smith of the National Institute of Standards and

<P>"Good conductors, such as metal objects, act like antennas to
pick up the intense electromagnetic field generated in microwave

situation like the wave- particle duality of light, in which it
is more convenient to think one way sometimes and another at
other times?"</A></B></FONT>

<P>-<I>Jeffrey De Glopper<BR>Palmdale, Calif.</I>

<P><A HREF="http://www.weber.edu/physics/carroll/carroll.htm">Bradley
Carroll</A>, a professor of physics at Weber State University in
Ogden, Utah, responds:

<P>"According to modern physics field theories, each of the four
basic interactions (a better term than 'force') is mediated by a
type of particle:

<P>"The strong (nuclear) interaction is carried by gluons. (This is
the interaction that holds together the particles in the nuclei
of atoms.)

<P>"The electromagnetic interaction is carried by photons. (This is
the interaction responsible for all electrical and magnetic
phenomena.)

<P>"The weak (nuclear) interaction is carried by weak bosons. (This
is the interaction that governs certain radioactive decays, such
as beta decay.)

<P>"The gravitational interaction is carried by gravitons. (This,
of course, is the interaction that gives rise to the familiar
pull of gravity.)

<P>"Although the graviton has yet to be observed, some of its
hypothesized properties are known. It is a massless particle
having no electrical charge. Its spin (a property of subatomic
particles that is not directly analogous to the rotation of a
macroscopic object like a top) is twice that of the other field
particles listed above; in technical terms, its spin is 2 hbar
instead of 1 hbar, where hbar is Planck's constant divided by 2
pi.

<P>"Two masses attract each other gravitationally because they are
constantly exchanging virtual gravitons, just as two
electrically charged particles are drawn together--or repelled
apart--by the exchange of virtual photons. (A 'virtual particle'
is one that cannot be directly detected.) This exchange happens
at all times. <A HREF="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Cyberia/
NumRel/GravWaves.html">Gravitational waves</A>, in contrast, can
arise when an object undergoes an acceleration. Asymmetric
supernova explosions or collisions between <A
HREF="http://www.astro.umd.edu/%7Emiller/
astr100/evolution/neutron.html">neutron stars</A> are the kinds of
events that could produce powerful blasts of gravitational
waves. Gravitational waves have been indirectly detected in
certain <A HREF="http://www.psc.edu/
science/Taylor/Relativity.html">binary neutron star systems</A>,
in which the energy carried off by those waves causes observable
changes in the stars' orbits.

<P>"Virtual gravitons pass between two objects even when there are
no gravitational waves present (for instance, when the masses
are at rest), so it really isn't correct to say that gravity is
a wave.

<P>"An analogy with an electrically charged particle might help
clarify the situation. When a charged particle is at rest, it is
surrounded by a static electric field (no waves). If another
charged particle encounters this field, it experiences a force.
The quantum view would describe this in terms of an exchange of
virtual photons by the two particles. On the other hand, if a
charged particle is accelerated, its electric field is ' shaken'
to produce an electromagnetic (light) wave that spreads out from
the particle. In this case, the energy and momentum of the light
wave are carried by real, detectable photons.

<P>"In a similar manner, when a massive particle is at rest, it is
surrounded by a static gravitational field (a static curvature
of spacetime, no waves) . If another massive particle encounters
this field, it experiences a force that can be described in
quantum terms as an exchange of virtual gravitons by the two
masses. On the other hand, if a massive particle is accelerated,
its gravitational field is 'shaken' to produce a gravitational
wave that spreads out through spacetime from the particle. The
energy and momentum of that gravitational wave are carried by
real gravitons."

"How does a microwave oven cook foods? Is it harmful if some of the microwave

<P>Chad Mueller, assistant professor of chemistry at <A

replies:

<P>"A microwave oven cooks food because the water molecules inside it absorb
the microwave radiation and thereby heat up and heat the surrounding food.
Microwave radiation will similarly heat up skin and other body parts. In
fact, people stationed at big microwave towers in cold climates used to
stand in front of the microwave generators in order to warm themselves. The
radiation is harmful mostly to the parts of the body that cannot conduct the
heat away very effectively---the eyes especially. I think that heat transfer
could explain why one sometimes hears about people (fast-food workers, for
instance) getting headaches when exposed to leaking microwave ovens."

HREF="http://www.nuceng.ufl.edu/department/faculty/pages/hintenlang.html">David
E. Hintenlang</A>, associate professor nuclear and radiological engineering
at the University of Florida at Gainesville, adds some further details:

<P>"Microwave ovens cook food by generating intermolecular friction between the
molecules of the food. The microwaves cause water molecules to vibrate; the
increased friction between the molecules results in heat. Microwaves could
affect your tissue in a similar way if they were able to escape from the
microwave oven. Modern microwave ovens are designed to allow essentially no
leakage of microwaves, however. The only time for concern would be if the
door is broken or damaged, in which case the oven should not be used."

"Why do beautiful bands of color appear in the tiny oil slicks that form
atop puddles on a rainy day? More specifically, why does each band have a
different color, and why do the various bands remain distinct?"</A></B></FONT>

<P>-<I>Jorge Numata<BR>Monterrey, Mexico</I>

<P>The following answer comes from <A
HREF="http://www.che.ufl.edu/~baabct/faculty/shah.html">Dinesh O.
Shah</A>; he is Charles A. Stokes Professor of Chemical Engineering and
Anesthesiology at the University of Florida at Gainesville:

<P>"When you see an oil film on the road on a rainy day, it gives rise to
bands of beautiful colors for the following reason:

<P>"Small amounts of oil are usually present on the road surface (for
instance, lubricating oil from cars, trucks and bicycles). When it rains,
drops of oil float on the layer of water that collects on the road because
the density of oil is less than that of the water--the same reason that
wood floats on water. Commercial oil formulations usually contain a
surfactant, an additive that causes the oil drops to spread out into a
thin film atop the water. That film is thickest in the center of the
patch, or oil slick, and thinnest at the periphery.

<P>"Light reflects upward both from the top of the oil film and from the
underlying interface between the oil and the water; the path length (the
distance from the reflection to your eye) is slightly different depending
on whether the returned light comes from the top or from the bottom of the
oil film. If the difference in path length is an integral multiple of the
wavelength of the light, rays reflected from the two locations will
reinforce each other, a process called constructive interference. If,
however, the rays reach your eye out of step, they will cancel each other
out due to destructive interference. 

<P>"Sunlight contains all the colors of the rainbow--the famous ROYGBIV (red,
orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet). Each color of light has a
different wavelength. Hence, a given disparity in the path length will
cause constructive interference of certain colors, whereas other colors
will not be observed because of destructive interference. Because the oil
film gradually thins from its center to its periphery, different bands of
the oil slick produce different colors."

Considering the obvious benefits of fusion energy and the considerable
efforts spent trying to attain them, why hasn't fusion research so far
produced better results?</A>"</B></FONT>

<P>-<I>Pierce Gorman<BR>Lee's Summit, Montana</I>

<P><A HREF="http://www.aip.org/HyperNewsConf/hn/ripin/1.html">Barrett H.
Ripin</A>, associate executive officer of <A HREF="http://aps.org/">The
American Physical Society</A>, offers this reply: 

<P>"Actually, fusion research has made remarkable progress in recent years. There
is no longer any question of its scientific feasibility: near breakeven (the
state at which the fusion power produced equals the power consumed to
sustain the plasma) has been demonstrated with actual fusion fuels in
Princeton's nearly 20-year-old <A HREF="http://www.pppl.gov/TFTR/">Tokamak
Fusion Test Reactor</A> (TFTR). Dramatically improved operating regimes have
recently been discovered that may form the basis of a practical energy
reactor. An alternate approach, known as inertial confinement fusion, has
also made substantial progress. Inertial confinement fusion is poised to
demonstrate better than break-even gains at the turn of the century. The
clear key to this progress has been advances in understanding the scientific
underpinnings of plasmas and of fusion science. In the process, several
billion-dollar-per-year applications of plasmas have emerged. 

<P>"The questions at hand now are really: Will fusion energy become practical
and economically feasible? Is society willing to make the necessary investment
to find out if the answer is yes?

<P>"When fusion research began in earnest 30 years ago, people simply did not
appreciate the complexity and subtlety of the science of plasmas, and the
concomitant depth of understanding that would be needed to make controlled
fusion work. Scientists also vastly underestimated the engineering
requirements and constraints--a result both of naivete and unknown scientific
hurdles. And it is natural that the closer one gets to the goal of practical
energy, the longer each next step takes. The experimental devices grow
larger and more expensive as one approaches a commercially viable fusion
reactor. 

<P>"Is it worth continuing fusion development? If scientists conclude that the
burning of fossil fuels is inducing unacceptable global climate change, then
we have a limited number of alternatives to turn to: solar-based sources
(photovoltaics, ocean, wind, etc.), nuclear fission and fusion. Solar-based
sources will be increasingly important in niches but can not supply
humanity's bulk power demands, particularly if worldwide standards of living
continue to rise. Nuclear fission could fill the gap, but it has well-known
disadvantages. 

<P>"So the question really becomes: Can we afford to take the risk not to
vigorously pursue fusion? One new power plant costs between $1 billion and
$10 billion these days; a new generation of power plants would total about
$10 trillion! Is fusion research funding of around a billion dollars per
year for even 50 more years a reasonable gamble? It is to me." 

<P>Charles C. Baker, associate director for fusion at the <A
HREF="http://www-soe.ucsd.edu/">School of Engineering</A> at the University
of California, San Diego, and the International Thermonuclear Experimental
Reactor (ITER) U.S. Home Team Leader, adds his views:

<P>"Thank you for giving me the opportunity to respond to this question. First,
let me state that I disagree with the premise of the question. Research in
magnetic-confinement fusion has produced excellent results. In the past 15
years, research in the U.S. and other countries has increased by 10,000,000
times the fusion power level produced in experiments, and we have now
achieved production of 10 megawatts of fusion power on the Tokamak Fusion
Test Reactor at Princeton. (A <A
HREF="http://www.pppl.gov/~rfheeter/fusion-faq/glossary/t.html#Tokamak">tokamak</A>
is a kind of magnetic donut that has proven to be a particularly stable way
to confine the extremely hot plasma needed to achieve fusion.) This dramatic
progress has been accomplished through investments made by the U.S., Europe,
and Japan during the 1970s on a new, more powerful class of tokamak
experiment. 

<P>"The next step in power reactor performance levels, at which the plasma is
capable of ignition and plasma 'burn' (wherein most of the heating energy
comes from the fusion reactions), again requires a new, more powerful
experimental device. The U.S. tried to proceed with a next-step burning
plasma experiment in the 1980s, but was unable to obtain congressional
funding. The U.S., Europe, Japan and Russia are now collaborating on the
design and R&amp;D work for a project called the <A
HREF="http://iter.ucsd.edu/">International Thermonuclear Experimental
Reactor</A>. ITER is designed to achieve plasma ignition and long-pulse
burn. It will also demonstrate the technology required for the core of a
fusion power plant and the systems needed for extracting power from the
device. This six-year collaboration, called the Engineering Design
Activities, began in 1992, and exploratory discussions are now underway
concerning cost-shared, international construction of this device. Such an
engineering test reactor is required by all parties for progress toward
practical fusion energy, so cost sharing for this step is mutually
advantageous.

<P>"The combined results from a variety of tokamaks around the world have
produced an impressive set of achievements. Neutral beams and a variety of
radio-frequency heating methods can provide tens of megawatts of heating
power for creating high-temperature plasmas. Experimental devices have
produced ion temperatures as high as 45,000 electron volts and densities of
approximately 10<SUP>20</SUP> particles per cubic meter, sufficient for fusion
reactors. An important overall measure of physics performance is the 'triple
product' of the peak ion density, the plasma energy confinement time and the
peak ion temperature. A triple-product value of 7 x 10<SUP>24</SUP> electron
volt-seconds per cubic meter is required for an ignited, deuterium-tritium
reactor. <A HREF="http://www.jaeri.go.jp/INTRO/RESEARCH/fusion.html">JT-60U</A>,
a large Japanese tokamak, has already achieved triple products of 1.3 x
10<SUP>24</SUP> electron volt-seconds per cubic meter.

<P>"The nominal fusion power of ITER is 1,500 megawatts; it represents a
framework for a full-size fusion power reactor, though it is not designed to
produce electricity. An extrapolation of the present knowledge of tokamaks
indicates that commercial fusion reactors will be rather large and
expensive. Fortunately, ongoing research programs are revealing ways to
improve substantially the performance of tokamak reactors. These promising
new directions include higher fusion power densities, and hence smaller
reactors; development of 'transport barriers' in the plasma, leading to
improved energy confinement and smaller sizes; self-driven plasma currents
that permit steady-state operation and low recirculating power; and the
development of advanced divertor concepts to provide particle control and
heat removal over long reactor lifetimes. 

<P>"The rate of progress in the fusion program is consistent with the level of
resources being devoted to it. Actual funding has been much less than
anticipated during the detailed planning drawn up in the 1970s and 1980s.
Present levels of funding in the U.S. ($244 million in fiscal year 1996) are
not sufficient to keep pace with the earlier plans. As a result, the U.S. is
unfortunately passing its traditional leadership in magnetic fusion to
Europe and Japan.

<P>"In August 1996, the U.S. Department of Energy issued a Strategic Plan for
the Restructured U.S. Fusion Energy Sciences Program. The nation's previous
strategy was a schedule-driven development program to prove fusion to be a
technically and economically credible energy source, with the goal of an
operating, demonstration power plant by about 2025. In a climate of severe
budgetary constraints, however, that strategy became highly unrealistic. In
an attempt to stay as close as possible to the goal-oriented schedule, the
fusion program has concentrated almost all of its available resources on the
tokamak concept, virtually eliminating support for alternative approaches
and for basic plasma science. Despite impressive scientific progress, the
program continues to receive insufficient resources.

<P>"The new strategy emphasizes an international effort aimed at advancing the
scientific knowledge base needed for the development of an economically and
environmentally attractive fusion energy source. To be a credible partner in
this long-term quest, the U.S. needs a vigorous domestic program in fusion
science and technology. At a constant level of funding, the restructured
U.S. program will be able to focus on fusion's underlying scientific
foundations and will enable the nation to take the lead in selected areas of
expertise as part of the international effort to develop fusion energy.

<P>"The restructured U.S. program will strive to remain a credible partner in
the international fusion program that includes both ITER and many smaller
projects in all areas of fusion science and technology. Given the high
projected cost of creating a burning physics experiment and given that the
U.S. now funds only about one sixth of the world research effort, a strategy
based on international collaboration on fusion energy research and
development can be highly cost effective."

"According to current physical theory, is it possible for a human
being to travel through time?"</A></B></FONT>

<P>-<I>Cassandra Kelly<BR>Kanata, Ontario, Canada</I>

<P>As several respondents noted, we constantly travel through
time--just forward, and all at the same rate. But seriously,
time travel is more than mere fantasy, as noted by <A
HREF="http://www.physics.ucsb.edu/people/gary_horowitz.html">Gary
T. Horowitz</A>, a professor of physics at the University of
California at Santa Barbara:

<P>"Perhaps surprisingly, this turns out to be a subtle question.
It is not obviously ruled out by our current laws of nature.
Recent investigations into this question have provided some
evidence that the answer is no, but it has not yet been proven
to be impossible."

<P>Even the slight possibility of time travel exerts such
fascination that many physicists continue to study not only
whether it may be possible but also how one might do it.

<P>One of the leading researchers in this area is <A
HREF="http://www.montana.edu/~wwwph/faculty/hiscock.html
">William A. Hiscock</A>, a professor of physics at Montana
State University. Here are his thoughts on the matter:

<P>"Is it possible to travel through time? To answer this question,
we must be a bit more specific about what we mean by traveling
through time. Discounting the everyday progression of time, the
question can be divided into two parts: Is it possible, within a
short time (less than a human life span), to travel into the
distant future? And is it possible to travel into the past?

<P>"Our current understanding of fundamental physics tells us that
the answer to the first question is a definite yes, and to the
second, maybe.

<P>"The mechanism for traveling into the distant future is to use
the time-dilation effect of Special Relativity, which states
that a moving clock appears to tick more slowly the closer it
approaches the speed of light. This effect, which has been
overwhelmingly supported by experimental tests, applies to all
types of clocks, including biological aging.

<P>"If one were to depart from the earth in a spaceship that could
accelerate continuously at a comfortable one g (an acceleration
that would produce a force equal to the gravity at the earth's
surface), one would begin to approach the speed of light
relative to the earth within about a year. As the ship continued
to accelerate, it would come ever closer to the speed of light,
and its clocks would appear to run at an ever slower rate
relative to the earth. Under such circumstances, a round trip to
the center of our galaxy and back to the earth--a distance of
some 60,000 light-years--could be completed in only a little
more than 40 years of ship time. Upon arriving back at the
earth, the astronaut would be only 40 years older, while 60,000
years would have passed on the earth. (Note that there is no
'twin paradox,' because it is unambiguous that the space
traveler has felt the constant acceleration for 40 years, while
a hypothetical twin left behind on a spaceship circling the
earth has not.)

<P>"Such a trip would pose formidable engineering problems: the
amount of energy required, even assuming a perfect conversion of
mass into energy, is greater than a planetary mass. But nothing
in the known laws of physics would prevent such a trip from
occurring.

<P>"Time travel into the past, which is what people usually mean by
time travel, is a much more uncertain proposition. There are
many solutions to Einstein's equations of General Relativity
that allow a person to follow a timeline that would result in
her (or him) encountering herself--or her grandmother--at an
earlier time. The problem is deciding whether these solutions
represent situations that could occur in the real universe, or
whether they are mere mathematical oddities incompatible with
known physics. No experiment or observation has ever indicated
that time travel is occurring in our universe. Much work has
been done by theoretical physicists in the past decade to try to
determine whether, in a universe that is initially without time
travel, one can build a time machine--in other words, if it is
possible to manipulate matter and the geometry of space-time in
such a way as to create new paths that circle back in time.

<P>"How could one build a time machine? The simplest way currently
being discussed is to take a wormhole (a tunnel connecting
spatially separated regions of space-time) and give one mouth of
the wormhole a substantial velocity with respect to the other.
Passage through the wormhole would then allow travel to the
past.

<P>"Easily said--but where does one obtain a wormhole? Although the
theoretical properties of wormholes have been extensively
studied over the past decade, little is known about how to form
a macroscopic wormhole, large enough for a human or a spaceship
to pass through. Some speculative theories of quantum gravity
tell us that space-time has a complicated, foamlike structure of
wormholes on the smallest scales--10^-33 centimeter, or a
billion billion times smaller than an electron. Some physicists
believe it may be possible to grab one of these truly
microscopic wormholes and enlarge it to usable size, but at
present these ideas are all very hypothetical.

<P>"Even if we had a wormhole, would nature allow us to convert it
into a time machine? <A
HREF="http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/DAMTP/user/hawking/home.html">Stephen
Hawking</A> has formulated a "Chronology Protection Conjecture,"
which states that the laws of nature prevent the creation of a
time machine. At the moment, however, this is just a conjecture,
not proven.

<P>"Theoretical physicists have studied various aspects of physics
to determine whether this law or that might protect chronology
and forbid the building of a time machine. In all the searching,
however, only one bit of physics has been found that might
prohibit using a wormhole to travel through time. In 1982, <A
HREF="http://www.nadn.navy.mil/MathDept/mini/dak.html">Deborah
A. Konkowski</A> of the U.S. Naval Academy and I showed that the
energy in the vacuum state of a massless quantized field (such
as the photon) would grow without bound as a time machine is
being turned on, effectively preventing it from being used.
Later studies by Hawking and <A
HREF="http://astro.caltech.edu/people/bluebook/thorne.html">Kip
S. Thorne</A> of Caltech have shown that it is unclear whether
the growing energy would change the geometry of space-time
rapidly enough to stop the operation of the time machine. Recent
work by Tsunefumi Tanaka of Montana State University and myself,
along with independent research by <A
HREF="http://phys.washington.edu/cdb/personnel/@1018">David
Boulware</A> of the University of Washington, has shown that the
energy in the vacuum state of a field having mass (such as the
electron) does not grow to unbounded levels; this finding
indicates there may be a way to engineer the particle physics to
allow a time machine to work.

<P>"Perhaps the biggest surprise of the work of the past decade is
that it is not obvious that the laws of physics forbid time
travel. It is increasingly clear that the question may not be
settled until scientists develop an adequate theory of quantum
gravity."

<P><A HREF="http://www.uwm.edu/Dept/Physics/Docs/Faculty/friedman.html">John
L. Friedman</A> of the physics department at the University of
Wisconsin at Milwaukee has also given this subject a great deal
of consideration:

<P>"Special relativity implies that people or clocks at rest (or
not accelerating) age more quickly than partners traveling on
round-trips in which one changes direction to return to one's
partner. In the world's particle accelerators, this prediction
is tested daily: Particles traveling in circles at nearly the
speed of light decay more slowly than those at rest, and the
decay time agrees with theory to the high precision of the
measurements.

<P>"Within the framework of Special Relativity, the fact that
particles cannot move faster than light prevents one from
returning after a high-speed trip to a time earlier than the
time of departure. Once gravity is included, however, spacetime
is curved, so there are solutions to the equations of General
Relativity in which particles can travel in paths that take them
back to earlier times. Other features of the geometries that
solve the equations of General Relativity include gravitational
lenses, gravitational waves and black holes; the dramatic
explosion of discoveries in radio and X-ray astronomy during the
past two decades has led to the observation of gravitational
lenses and gravitational waves, as well as to compelling
evidence for giant black holes in the centers of galaxies and
stellar-sized black holes that arise from the collapse of dying
stars. But there do not appear to be regions of spacetime that
allow time travel, raising the fundamental question of what
forbids them--or if they really are forbidden.

<P>"A recent surprise is that one can circumvent the 'grandfather
paradox,' the idea that it is logically inconsistent for
particle paths to loop back to earlier times, because, for
example, a granddaughter could go back in time to do away with
her grandfather. For several simple physical systems, solutions
to the equations of physics exist for any starting condition. In
these model systems, something always intervenes to prevent
inconsistency analogous to murdering one's grandfather.

<P>"Then why do there seem to be no time machines? Two different
answers are consistent with our knowledge. The first is simply
that the classical theory has a much broader set of solutions
than the correct theory of quantum gravity. It is not
implausible that causal structure enters in a fundamental way in
quantum gravity and that classical spacetimes with time loops
are spurious--in other words, that they do not approximate any
states of the complete theory. A second possible answer is
provided by recent results that go by the name chronology
protection: One supposes that quantum gravity allows microscopic
structures that violate causality, and one shows that the
character of macroscopic matter forbids the existence of regions
with macroscopically large time loops. To create a time machine
would require negative energy, and quantum mechanics appears to
allow only extremely small regions of negative energy. And the
forces needed to create an ordinary-sized region with time loops
appear to be extremely large.

<P>"To summarize: It is very likely that the laws of physics rule
out macroscopic time machines, but possible that spacetime is
filled with microscopic time loops."

"What exactly happens, on a molecular or atomic level, when two objects
touch? Do the electrons on the two surfaces actually come into contact with
each other?"</A></B></FONT>

<P>-<I>Kurt Erlenbach<BR>Titusville, Fla.</I>

<P><A HREF="http://ezekiel.ucsb.edu/mrl/faculty/wudl.html">Fred Wudl</A>, a
professor of
chemistry and materials at the University of California, Santa Barbara,
replies:

<P>"The answer to the first question is diffuse, pun intended. Quantum
mechanics teaches that the farther you move away from the nucleus of an
atom, the lower the probability of finding electrons that may belong to that
atom, but that even far from the nucleus there is still a finite probability
of finding the electrons.  So, strictly speaking, electrons on the 'surface'
of molecules are very diffuse but carry an electric charge. 

<P>"Because like charges repel, two molecules will resist being brought close
together. The shorter the distance between them, the more energy it takes to
push them to get even closer. If the molecules approach each other with
sufficient energy, however, they may exchange atoms or actually form a bond
(chemical reaction). Otherwise, their electron clouds will just deform to
avoid the large electrostatic repulsion, and the two will then fly apart
again."

<P>So the answer really depends on what the surfaces are made of and how they
interact. Atoms on the two surfaces may chemically bond to one another, and
in that sense touch; in other circumstances, they may just avoid one
another.

"Can somebody finally settle this question: Does water flowing down a drain
spin in different directions depending on which hemisphere you're in? And if
so, why?"</A></B></FONT>

<P>-<I>Howard Bertolo<BR>Toronto, Ontario</I>

<P>This question would seem to be one of simple physics, and yet it continues
to engender sharp disagreements. The main problem here is the division
between theory and practice: whereas in principle the earth's rotation could
affect the direction of draining water, in the real world that effect is
probably swamped by other, less uniform influences.

<P>Brad Hanson, a staff geologist with the Louisiana Geological Survey,
presents the argument of why--in theory--water going down the drain would
indeed spin in different directions depending on which hemisphere you're in:

<P>"The direction of motion is caused by the Coriolis effect. This can be
visualized if you imagine putting a pan of water on a turntable and then
spinning the turntable in a counterclockwise direction, the direction in
which the earth rotates as seen from above the north pole. The water on the
bottom of the pan will be dragged counterclockwise direction slightly faster
than the water at the surface, giving the water an apparent clockwise spin
in the pan. But if you were to look at the water in the pan from below,
corresponding to seeing it from the south pole, it would appear to be
spinning in a counterclockwise direction. Likewise, the rotation of the
earth gives rise to an effect that tends to accelerate draining water in a
clockwise direction in the Northern hemisphere and counterclockwise in the
Southern."

<P>Fred W. Decker, professor emeritus of oceanic and atmospheric science at <A
HREF="http://www.orst.edu/mc/coldep/coldep.htm">Oregon State University</A>
notes, however, that the Coriolis effect may actually have little to do with
the behavior of real-world sinks and tubs:

<P>"Really, I doubt that the direction of the draining water represents
anything more than an accidental twist given by the starting flow. The local
irregularities of motion are so dominant that the Coriolis effect is not
likely to be revealed. An empirical test could help."

<P><A
HREF="http://sparky.wrlc.org/cgi-bin/waisgate?WAISdocID=552092482+1+0+0&WAISaction=retrieve">Robert
Ehrlich</A>, a physicist at George Mason University, expands on these ideas:

<P>"Do <A
HREF="http://jcbmac.chem.brown.edu/scissorsHtml/liquids/bathtub.html">bathtubs
drain in different directions</A> in the two hemispheres? If you had a
specially prepared bathtub, the answer would be yes. For any normal bathtub
you are likely to encounter in the home, however, the answer is no. 

<P>"The tendency of a circulation in a fluid to develop in a clockwise
direction in the Northern Hemisphere and a counterclockwise direction in the
Southern Hemisphere can be traced to the earth's rotation. Imagine a cannon
fired southward from any latitude above the equator. Its initial eastward
motion is the same as that at a point on the spinning earth. This initial
eastward velocity is less than that at a point later in its trajectory,
because points closer to the equator travel in a bigger circle as the earth
rotates. Therefore, the cannon shell is deflected westward (to the right),
from the perspective of a person standing on the earth. A gunner firing a
cannon northward would find that the shell is also deflected toward the
right. These sideways deflections are attributed to the Coriolis force,
although there really is no force involved--it is just an effect of being in
a rotating reference frame.

<P>"The Coriolis force accounts for why cyclones (clockwise-rotating storms)
exist in the Northern Hemisphere, but anticyclones (which rotate
counterclockwise) exist in the Southern Hemisphere. The effects of the
rotation of the earth are, of course, much more pronounced when the
circulation covers a larger area than would occur inside your bathtub. 

<P>"In your tub, such factors as any small asymmetry of the shape of the drain
will determine which direction the circulation occurs. Even in a tub having
a perfectly symmetric drain, the circulation direction will be primarily
influenced by any residual currents in the bathtub left over from the time
when it was filled. It can take more than a day for such residual currents
to subside completely. If all extraneous influences (including air currents)
can be reduced below a certain level, one apparently can observe that drains
do consistently drain in different directions in the two hemispheres."

<P>Finally, Thomas Humphrey, a senior scientist at the San Francisco <A
HREF="http://www.exploratorium.edu/">Exploratorium</A>,
discusses in more detail the reasons why we do not see the Coriolis effect
at work in the bathroom:

<P>"There is an African country near the equator where entrepreneurs have set
up two toilets, one just north of the equator, the other just south of it.
For a fee, they will allegedly demonstrate that the toilets flush in
opposite directions. It is only for show, however; there is no real effect.
Yes, there is such a thing as the Coriolis effect, but it is not enough to
dominate the flushing of a toilet--and the effect is weakest at the equator.

<P>"The telling comparison is between the magnitude of the Coriolis effect and
the initial amount of angular momentum in the water--that is, how much is it
spinning anyway, regardless of the earth's rotation. Coriolis acceleration
at mid-latitudes is about one ten-millionth the acceleration of gravity.
Because it is a very small acceleration, it needs a very long distance for
it to produce an appreciable curvature--and hence directionality--to the
motion. A toilet or sink is just not large enough. The Coriolis effect
influences <A
HREF="http://covis1.atmos.uiuc.edu/guide/forces/html/coriolis1.html">atmospheric
circulation</A> because wind velocities may be hundreds of times greater
than the motions in a sink and because the distances involved are far larger
than the tiny draining diameter in a sink or toilet. 

<P>"It is impossible to find a cup full of water that does not have some
average net motion; it will always be going one way or the other, and that
little amount of angular motion is enough to swamp the Coriolis effect. The
net motion in the water becomes much more pronounced as the water is forced
to move in toward the center of evacuation, causing the normally invisible
flows in the water to become visible as the water nears the drain. The
ultimate direction of that flow is random--it can go one way one time, the
other way the next.

<P>"If you run an experiment in your sink--fill the sink, then pull out the
stopper--the water will almost always go down the same way, making you
wonder if this is really a random effect. But you will find that the faucet
is almost always off center or that there is some other asymmetry in the
sink. As a result, filling the sink consistently gives it some net rotation
in the same direction, which you see as the normal direction of evacuation.
Toilets will always drain and fill the same way, for the same reason."

"Is it true that hot water freezes faster than cold water
or that cold water boils faster than hot water? It seems hard to
believe, but some people swear that it is so."</A></B></FONT>

<P><I>-Patrick Bachler<BR>Chicago, Ill.</I>

<P>This seemingly simple question continues to generate considerable
controversy. Takamasa Takahashi, a physicist at St. Norbert College in
De Pere, Wis., attempts a definitive answer:

<P>"Cold water does not boil faster than hot water. The rate of heating
of a liquid depends on the magnitude of the temperature difference
between the liquid and its surroundings (the flame on the stove, for
instance). As a result, cold water will be absorbing heat faster while
it is still cold; once it gets up to the temperature of hot water, the
heating rate slows down and from there it takes just as long to bring it
to a boil as the water that was hot to begin with. Because it takes cold
water some time to reach the temperature of hot water, cold water
clearly takes longer to boil than hot water does. There may be some
psychological effect at play; cold water starts boiling sooner than one
might expect because of the aforementioned greater heat absorption rate
when water is colder.

<P>"To the first part of the question--'Does hot water freeze faster
than cold water?'--the answer is 'Not usually, but possibly under
certain conditions.' It takes 540 calories to vaporize one gram of
water, whereas it takes 100 calories to bring one gram of liquid water
from 0 degrees Celsius to 100 degrees C. When water is hotter than 80
degrees C, the rate of cooling by rapid vaporization is very high
because each evaporating gram draws at least 540 calories from the water
left behind. This is a very large amount of heat compared with the one
calorie per Celsius degree that is drawn from each gram of water that
cools by regular thermal conduction.

<P>"It all depends on how fast the cooling occurs, and it turns out that
hot water will not freeze before cold water but will freeze before
lukewarm water. Water at 100 degrees C, for example, will freeze before
water warmer than 60 degrees C but not before water cooler than 60
degrees C. This phenomenon is particularly evident when the surface area
that cools by rapid evaporation is large compared with the amount of
water involved, such as when you wash a car with hot water on a cold
winter day. [For reference, look at <A
HREF="http://www.branch.com/arbor/tape.html"> Conceptual Physics</A>, by
Paul G. Hewitt (HarperCollins, 1993).]

<P>"Another situation in which hot water may freeze faster is when a pan
of cold water and a pan of hot water of equal mass are placed in a
freezer compartment. There is the effect of evaporation mentioned above,
and also the thermal contact with the freezer shelf will cool the bottom
part of the body of water. If water is cold enough, close to four
degrees C (the temperature at which water is densest), then
near-freezing water at the bottom will rise to the top. Convection
currents will continue until the entire body of water is 0 degrees C, at
which point all the water finally freezes. If the water is initially
hot, cooled water at the bottom is denser than the hot water at the top,
so no convection will occur and the bottom part will start freezing
while the top is still warm. This effect, combined with the evaporation
effect, may make hot water freeze faster than cold water in some cases.
In this case, of course, the freezer will have worked harder during the
given amount of time, extracting more heat from hot water."

<P>Robert Ehrlich of George Mason University, in Fairfax, Va., adds to
some of the points made by Takahashi:

<P>"There are two ways in which hot water could freeze faster than cold
water. One way [described in Jearl Walker's book The Flying Circus of
Physics (Wiley, 1975)] depends on the fact that hot water evaporates
faster, so that if you started with equal masses of hot and cold water,
there would soon be less of the hot water to freeze, and hence it would
overtake the cold water and freeze first, because the lesser the mass,
the shorter the freezing time. The other way it could happen (in the
case of a flat-bottomed dish of water placed in a freezer) is if the hot
water melts the ice under the bottom of the dish, leading to a better
thermal contact when it refreezes."

<P>Still feeling skeptical? Fred W. Decker, a meteorologist at Oregon
State University in Corvallis, encourages readers to settle the question
for themselves:

<P>"You can readily set up an experiment to learn which freezes earlier:
water that is initially hot, or water that is initially cold. Use a
given setting on an electric hot plate and clock the time between start
and boiling for a given pot containing, say, one quart of water; first
start with the water as cold as the tap will provide and then repeat it
with the hottest water available from that tap. I'd wager the quart of
water initially hot will come to a boil in much less time than the quart
of water initially cold.

<P>"The freezing experiment is harder to perform, because it ideally
requires a walk-in cold storage chamber that is set to a temperature
below freezing. Take into the chamber two quart-volume milk bottles
filled with water, one from a hot tap and the other from a cold tap
outside the chamber. Time them to freezing, and I would wager again that
the initially colder water will freeze sooner than the initially hot
water."

<P>[We would add that, if you don't want to suffer in a walk-in freezer,
you can conduct a reasonably good version of the above experiment in the
freezer compartment of your refrigerator; just don't check the water too
often-in which case it will never freeze-or too infrequently, in which
case you may miss the moment when one container is frozen but not the
other.]

<P>Decker concludes that "much folklore results from trying to answer
such a question under conditions that do not make 'all other things
equal,' which the foregoing experiments do."

"What are the processes that determine
the strange shape of a mushroom cloud after a nuclear, thermonuclear or
major chemical explosion?" </A></B></FONT>

<P><I>-Aasmund Skjaeveland<BR>Stord, Norway</I>

<P>David Dearborn, a physicist at Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory, responds:

<P>"Contrary to a common misconception, the shape of the mushroom cloud
does not depend on the nuclear or thermonuclear component; as you note,
a massive detonation of chemical explosives would produce the same
effect.

<P>"A mushroom cloud forms when an explosion creates a very hot bubble
of gas. In the case of a nuclear detonation, the bomb emits a blast of
x-rays, which ionize and heat the surrounding air; that hot bubble of
gas is known as a fireball. The hot air is buoyant, so it quickly rises
and expands. The rising cloud creates a powerful updraft which picks up
dust, forming the stem of the mushroom cloud.

<P>"The central part of fireball is hottest, creating a rolling motion
as it interacts with the outer portions. Thermal instabilities, called
Kelvin- Helmholtz instabilities, occur at the interface between the
fireball and the neighboring cool air. If you watch a movie of a nuclear
detonation, you can see entrained material swirling outwards as a
result.

<P>"All atomic bombs produce a bulge and a stem, but the really huge,
flat clouds--the ones that  could be described only as mushrooms-- come
from the very high-yield explosions caused by thermonuclear weapons
(hydrogen bombs). The fireball from an H-bomb rises so high that it hits
the tropopause, the boundary between the troposphere and the
stratosphere. There is a strong temperature gradient at the tropopause,
which prevents the two layers of the atmosphere from mixing much. The
hot bubble of the fireball initially expands and rises. By the time the
bubble has risen from sea level to the tropopause, it is no longer hot
enough to break through the boundary. (In other words, the bubble
encounters material that has more energy than it does, so it is no
longer buoyant.) At that point, the fireball flattens out; it can no
longer expand upward, so it expands to the side into an exaggerated
mushroom cap. The same thing happens to big <A
HREF="http://covis.atmos.uiuc.edu/guide/stormspotters/html/slide71.html">summer
thundercloud</A> when they rise up to the tropopause, producing a
characteristic flattened-anvil shape.

<P>"Those interested in learning more about mushroom clouds and other
atomic-bomb phenomena might want to look at the book The Effect of
Nuclear Weapons, compiled and edited by Samuel Glasstone and Philip J.
Dolan (U.S. Department of Defense and U.S. Department of Energy, 1977)."

"What is the scientific principle stating
that the measurement of any object affects that object--that is, that it
is impossible to get a perfect measurement? Who came up with this idea,
and can it be tested?"</A></B></FONT>

<P><I>-Tom Peters<BR>Temperance, MI</I>

<P>Jesse Gordon of the Buffalo River Stewardship Foundation passed 
along this response:

<P>"You are referring to the 'Uncertainty Principle,' deduced by <A
HREF="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/%7Ehistory/Mathematicians/Heisenberg.html">Werner
Heisenberg</A> early in the 20th century. Heisenberg realized that one
implication of quantum physics is that the act of measurement always
disturbs the object measured. The Uncertainty Principle applies to all
objects, but is only significant at the atomic or subatomic level. At
such scales, there are discernible limits to how certain we can be about
an object's position.

<P>"The physical reason behind this uncertainty is that measurement, by
its very nature, requires using some sort of energy--for example,
shining a light on the object to be measured. Light consists of discrete
units, or quanta, of energy known as photons. Shining a light on an
electron means bombarding it with photons, each of which has a big
effect on the electron."

<P>Heisenberg and his fellow quantum pioneers recognized that very
energetic photons will give a more accurate reading of the electron's
position, but they are also more disruptive. Hence, there is a tradeoff:
the more precisely we know an object's position at the time of
measurement, the less we know about its present whereabouts. This
uncertainty cannot be eliminated by designing better instruments; it is
inherent in the laws of quantum physics.

<P>Gordon then considers the second part of the question: "One
significant test of the Heisenberg principle can be thought of in
philosophical terms: Let's say we could measure both the position and
velocity of every sub-atomic particle with infinite accuracy. Then we
could measure the position and velocity of every particle in your body,
and predict the future positions and velocities of every particle in
your body. In other words, we could predict exactly what you are going
to do for the indefinite future; you would have a deterministic world
which precludes free will. The Uncertainty Principle is the physical
reason why free will is possible. Even with infinitely accurate
instruments, we cannot predict the future actions of sub-atomic
particles, and therefore we cannot predict the future of macroscopic
particles (like people) either."

<P>On a more practical level, the Uncertainty Principle explains
numerous real, observed physical effects, such as quantum tunneling.
Sometimes an electron will "tunnel" to a location where, according to
classical physics, it could never appear. This phenomenon forms the
basis of the scanning <A HREF="http://www.d.umn.edu/%7Ejmaps/stm1.html">tunneling
microscope</A>,
which allows scientists to map the location of individual atoms.

"What is the meaning of the phrase, "It is too cold to
snow"? Doesn't it <I>have</I> to be cold for it to snow?"</A></B></FONT>

<P>-<I>Kathy Bennett<BR>Hayward, Calif.</I>

<P>Matt Peroutka, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service's
Techniques Development Laboratory in Silver Spring, Maryland, answers:

<P>"Yes. It has to be cold for it to snow, if your definition of cold is
like that of most folks who live in the mid-latitudes. But the
atmosphere must contain moisture to generate snow--and very cold air
contains very little moisture.  Once the air temperature at ground level
drops below about -10 degrees Fahrenheit (-20 degrees Celsius), snowfall
becomes unlikely in most places. Therefore, significant snowfall at such
very low temperatures is rare."

<P>For those craving a more technical explanation of the phenomenon,
Fred W. Decker of the <A HREF="http://ocs.ats.orst.edu/">Oregon Climate
Service</A> at Oregon State University offers the following:

<P>"The maximum concentration of (invisible) water vapor which can occur
in air decreases to extremely low values at very cold temperatures. Most
clouds form through a process called expansion cooling. First, a mass of
air rises, causing it to expand (because of the lower atmospheric
pressure). Expansion causes the air to grow cooler, which reduces the
amount of water vapor it can contain. The 'excess' vapor condenses out
into a cloud.

<P>"At very cold temperatures, the expansion cooling process starts in
air that already has a low water vapor content. Hence, the clouds that
form at colder temperatures--if any form at all--contain much less
suspended water in the form of ice crystals, the starting sites for snow
crystal formation.

<P>"At higher, but still subfreezing, temperatures, ice crystals hook
onto each other to create snowflakes. In extreme cold, the ice crystals
remain independent. There actually is no such thing as too low a
temperature for some sort of ice crystal to form and for such crystals
to settle out and land on the surface. Such a deposit of ice needles is
not usually considered 'snow,' however; in the Arctic, for instance, we
might refer instead to an ice fog."

"How exactly does light transform into heat--for
instance, when sunlight warms up a brick wall? I understand that
electrons in the atoms in the wall absorb the light, but how does that
absorbed sunlight turn into thermal energy?"</A></B></FONT>

<P>-<I>William Lee Bell<BR>Robbins, North Carolina</I>

<P>It turns out that, as often happens in science, that there is more
than one way to explain the same basic phenomenon.

<P>Tom Zepf of the physics department at Creighton University in Omaha,
Neb., notes that "Sunlight heats a material such as water or a brick
primarily because the long wavelength, or infrared, portion of the sun's
radiation resonates well with molecules in the material, thereby setting
them into motion. So the energy transfer that causes the temperature of
the substance to rise takes place at the molecular rather than the
electronic level."

<P>Scott M. Auerbach, a theoretical chemist at the University of
Massachusetts at Amherst offers a more detailed answer:

<P>"Light from the sun excites electrons in the atoms which constitute
the brick wall. How does that electronic energy get converted to heat,
you ask. The key is 'radiationless transitions.' Here's how it works:
the atoms of the brick are perpetually vibrating. Some of those atoms
vibrate sufficiently vigorously that their vibrational energy is roughly
equal to the electronic energy (photons) absorbed from the sun--in
essence, they are in resonance with the solar energy. Those atoms then
make a quantum transition from 'electronically excited' to
'vibrationally excited,' meaning that the energy causes the whole atom
to move. We feel that motion as "heat." The atoms which make the jump to
vibrational excitation soon collide into neighboring atoms, dissipating
their vibrational energy throughout the entire brick, making the brick
hot throughout."

"I have been arguing with a friend of mine about
car crashes. If you were going to be in a collision, would it be
"safer" to hit a tree or a power pole than to hit an oncoming
car head-on? I always thought the tree or power pole, because
they give. If you were to hit another car head-on it would be
twice as bad because it is your speed plus theirs when you
collide. My friend believes you are better off hitting the
on-coming car. Who is correct?"</A></B></FONT>

<P><I>-Blaine Hensen<BR>Dallas, Texas</I>
 
<P>The solution to your argument is more complicated and
controversial than you might think. 

<P>Michael S. Bronzini, Director of the Center for Transportation
Analysis at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, offers what seems
like an intuitively reasonable answer: 

<P>"You will do less damage to your car and yourself by hitting a
fixed object. The reason is that the damage done is a function
of the relative velocity of the objects. If you are traveling at
35 miles per hour and hit a large tree, the relative velocity is
35 miles per hour. However, if you hit a car coming toward you
at 35 miles per hour, the relative velocity is twice that. The
effect of hitting the other car is therefore roughly the same as
of driving into the tree at 70 miles per hour."

<P>Sensible though that argument may seem, it does not tell the
whole story. What really matters when you get into an accident
is how suddenly the car come to a rest. 

<P>Dick Smith of The University of West Florida explains: 

<P>"The one thing you know about a tree (assuming it's a big one!)
is that it won't move, so that if you hit one, your car will
stop immediately. There's a certain force on your car needed to
do that, and the tree supplies that force." The same thing
happens when you hit another car: the momentum of the oncoming
vehicle cancels out your own, leading to rapid (and disastrous)
deceleration. The main difference is, when you hit a tree you
can't "see" the force that stops you; it is all tied up in the
bonds that hold the atoms and molecules together. 

<P>So is it a tossup between hitting a tree and hitting an oncoming
car? Well, not exactly. Smith continues, "What happens when you
hit an oncoming car depends on the difference between your car's
speed and mass compared to the other car's. If it's a small car
traveling at a lower speed, then you overpower that car, so to
speak, and the two of you continue in the direction you were
traveling, just at a slower speed. The oncoming car does not
supply enough force to make you stop immediately, so the effect
on your car (and you) is less than if you hit a large tree. But
if the oncoming car is heavier or traveling faster than you are,
then it is YOU who ends up being forced backward down the road,
with consequent greater damage to you and your car than if you
hit the tree."

<P>But things are even more complicated. The angle of impact, for
instance, greatly affects how much damage occurs in an accident.
Your comment about "give" is also relevant. A fat old oak tree
will simply stop you in your tracks; modern automobiles have
built-in "crumple zones" designed to absorb some of the energy
of impact. And Bronzini notes that "these days, most power poles
have been fitted with slip bases which allow impacting vehicles
to knock them out of the way. Chances are that the pole would do
little damage if you are wearing your safety belt." Remember to
drive safely!

"Why are rainbows curved? Is it because of refraction in
the drops of water?" </A></B></FONT>

<P>-<I>Valentin Rueda<BR>Madrid, Spain</I>

<P><A HREF="http://www.uwm.edu/Dept/Physics/new/greenler.html">Robert
Greenler</A> of the physics department of the University of
Wisconsin-Milwaukee sent in this response:

<P>"In answering this question, it is helpful to start with a
description of the path followed by the rays that form the rainbow. As
can be seen in this <A
HREF="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/staff/blynds/RNBW5.GIF">diagram</A>, a
ray of light from the sun enters one side of a water drop, gets
refracted as it enters, reflects internally off the other side of the
drop, and emerges again from the other side, again with <A
HREF="http://www.geom.umn.edu/education/calc-init/rainbow/refraction.html">refraction</A>.
We can consider rays of light from the distant sun to be parallel.

<P>"If you trace a large number of parallel rays that strike a drop of
water at various points on the drop, you will discover that a
concentration of rays emerges at one specific angle, 42 degrees from the
angle at which the light entered. So we have a picture of parallel rays
coming from the sun, striking a lot of raindrops, and then being
reflected and refracted back from the drops--but not straight back,
rather at an angle of 42 <A
HREF="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/staff/blynds/rnbw4.gif">degrees</A>.

<P>"Now comes the crucial question: where in the sky do you look to see
the light returning from the raindrops? Let us start by defining a
direction in space: a direction exactly opposite the sun, called the
antisolar point. If you are standing outside during the daytime, the
antisolar point is marked by the shadow of your head. To see the light
coming back from the raindrops, look 42 degrees away from that antisolar
point. Of course, the region of the sky 42 degrees away from that point
is not just one direction but a whole collection of directions, one that
forms a circle around the antisolar point.

<P>"So, to summarize, look to the antisolar point, and then shift your
gaze to 42 degrees away--you are now looking at the rainbow. Rainbows
will always appear at that same angle from the antisolar point. The
height of the rainbow, however, will depend on how high the sun is above
the horizon.

<P>"And what about the colors of the rainbow? Each color of the spectrum
gets refracted by a different amount when it passes from air to water or
from water to air, the same as happens when light passes through a
prism. Consequently, the rainbow circle is not 42 degrees for all
colors. The circle is smaller for blue rays than it is for red rays, so
the primary rainbow is blue on the inside and red on the outside, with
the intermediate colors of the spectrum spread out in between.

<P>"It is also possible for some of the light rays entering the drop to
undergo not one but two <A
HREF="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/staff/blynds/rnbw7.gif">internal
reflections</A> before they emerge. If you look at a whole collection of
such rays, you see a concentration of light coming back at an angle of
51 degrees. These rays produce a <A
HREF="http://covis.atmos.uiuc.edu/guide/optics/rainbows/gifs/secon1.rainbow.gif">secondary
rainbow</A>, also centered on the antisolar point, having an angular
radius of 51 degrees; the secondary rainbow therefore appears outside of
the primary bow. The sequence of colors is reversed in the secondary
bow.

<P>"More information about rainbows and other atmospheric optical
phenomena can be found in my book '<A
HREF="http://www.cup.org/Titles/38/0521388651.html">Rainbows, Halos and
Glories</A>' (Cambridge University Press, 1990)."

"Is glass really a liquid? How can this be?"
</A></B></FONT>

<P><I>-Michael Te Arawa Bennett<BR> New Zealand</I>

<P>Steve W. Martin, an associate professor of materials science and
engineering at Iowa State University, was happy to tackle this question:

<P>The seeming paradox that a glass is at the same time a liquid and a
solid is not easily reconciled. Glasses are "solids" produced by cooling
a molten liquid fast enough that crystallization does not occur at the
normal freezing point. Instead, the liquid supercools into the
thermodynamic never-never land of metastability: kinetically settled
enough to exist as a well-defined state of matter, yet not truly
thermodynamically stable. As the supercooled liquid cools to lower and
lower temperatures, the viscosity of the liquid increases dramatically.
That happens because as thermal energy becomes ever less available,
chemical bonds within the liquid constrain the atomic motion more and
more.

<P>As the glass cools, the time it needs to demonstrate liquid behavior
(the "viscous relaxation time") increases and eventually reaches
extremes. At the so-called glass transition temperature, the relaxation
time is on the order of a few minutes. On a short timescale, the
"liquid" glass will appear solid, but after a short while, it can be
seen to be slowly flowing, like incredibly thick syrup. At still lower
temperatures, the relaxation time reaches values that are truly
geologic, i.e., many millions of years. Window glass at room temperature
has a nearly incalculable relaxation time, approaching the age of the
universe itself. For all practical observations, this glass is a solid.
But its solidity is in the eye of the beholder.

Virtual Reality technology but is probably best described as a
modern Renaissance man--an eclectic mix of computer programmer,

cyberspace</A>. <P>

SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN editor Corey S. Powell caught up with
Jaron Lanier to hear some of his current thoughts on the World
Wide Web, synthetic worlds and other silicon dreams.<P>

<HR>

<B>SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN</B>: I'd like to start by asking you
about the <A
HREF="http://://www.well.com/user/jaron/waterbed.html">video
feedback waterbed</A> [a project recently exhibited at the Exit
Art gallery in New York]. It seems to show your interests in
art, music and technology all blurring into each other. There it
is in a visual art gallery, but it is also a clever piece of
video feedback equipment and a music machine.<P>

<B>JARON LANIER</B>: Well, the theme of the Exit Art exhibition
was environments meant for listening to music, so I conceived it
to fit into that theme. The waterbed is bit of an experiment in
several areas. One of them is in social spaces, as you pointed
out; you enter this environment of ambiguous intimacy. I feel
drawn to experiment with ways that technology can interact with
notions of intimacy, because so much of technology is done in a
way that's very cold and has such an opposite affect.<P>

Another part of what I had in mind really was sort of as an
antidote to cutting-edgism. Sometimes I think it's important to
work explicitly with technologies that are a little out of
fashion and a little out of date. It' s the only way to get a
perspective that's a little bit higher than you get at the
cutting edge of technology. There are no degrees of freedom when
you're constantly moving in one direction: more-advanced, more-
advanced, more-advanced. Everything about this waterbed piece is
very retro. Waterbeds are sort of a 1970s thing. Video Feedback
is sort of a '70s, maybe a '60s thing.<P>

<B>SA</B>: Does that mean you see sort of a retro,
video-feedback element in Virtual Reality (VR)?<P>

<B>JL</B>: No, no. Actually, VR is just the reverse.
Virtual Reality, if anything, hasn't quite happened yet. We
still need more computer power, better-quality displays, better
sensors. We're still very much at the edge, and even the very
best Virtual Reality systems that can be built today with an
unlimited budget are not quite what I want them to be. So in the
area of Virtual Reality, I am constantly working in that world
of the cutting edge. Which is very exciting--I am not putting it
down.<P>

I've been thinking about this a bit lately, that in the history
of Western art--or at least in music, since that's the art I
know the best--being on the edge has been an incredible driver
for people. There's always been this very special charge
associated with coming up with a new musical chord or a chord
progression that people haven't heard before, or a new musical
instrument. Hearing a contra-bassoon for the first time was a
huge thrill for people, I'm sure.<P>

<B>SA</B>: In one of your essays, you describe musical
instruments and warfare as two of the main drivers of
technological progress.<P>

<B>JL</B>: Right. This notion of constantly pushing forward with
better and better technology and more advanced science is very
dear to me, but I do think that it's too constricting to spend
one's entire life in that mode. Sometimes you have to be able to
work outside of it.<P>

It's a bit of a challenge. If you can come up with a new idea
using new technology, the results come almost automatically. For
example, the first person who develops a Virtual Reality--which
in this case was me!-- automatically gets to do original work
with it. But coming up with something original to do with an old
technology, now that's really a challenge, because it means you
have to come up with something that nobody else has come up with
before. That's what brought me to the waterbed. It's just a
normal video camera and some big mirrors and a waterbed--that's
it!<P>

<B>SA</B>: You've been mixing art and technology since a young
age. How did that come about?<P>

<B>JL</B>: I think it's the world I grew up in. Kids growing up
today are even more immersed in a world of technology. The mass
culture of childhood right now is astonishingly technical.
Little kids know their Unix path punctuation so they can get
around the Web, and they know their HTML and stuff. It's pretty
shocking to me.<P>

But I've always loved traditional media, too. I do real
paintings, you know. I'm a little messy in the studio, so I'm a
bit of a danger. But I just adore it.<P>

What I am hoping to do with my career is promote a sort of a
balanced attitude towards technology and aesthetics, in which
you neither shy away from nor worship technology, but enjoy the
rush of being able to create entirely new things with it, and
also be able to appreciate its potential for bridging the gaps
between imagination in ways that not could be done without it. I
think that makes it a wonderful thing, but its only value is in
its ability to bridge gaps between people. All the ultimate
value comes from people still.<P>

That's where I think the relationship between artists and
technology goes wrong so much. People try to treat technology as
an object, and it can't be. It can only be a channel.<P>

<B>SA</B>: A lot of the exhibits that are specifically supposed
to showcase computers and art, or holography and art, are
usually awful.<P>

<B>JL</B>: Yeah. There's this certain feeling you're used to of
seeing something that's supposed to be technological art that
just feels meaningless and kind of dry and pretentious. It's
really a great shame. People are trying to treat technology as a
center of attention in its own right, when it should never be.
You should only pay attention to how it connects people
together.<P>

Also, there has been a problem in 20th-century art, that artists
are seeking novelty on a constant basis. When the novelty starts
to run dry, any new well that might have some novelty in it
immediately attracts hordes of customers. Technology is, by its
nature, persistently novel-- there always new technologies
coming down the road--so it's a very bounteous well for this
community. But people who are artists or art theorists, art
critics or curators are generally not very well educated in the
technology. So there is this very sad lowering of standards.<P>

For instance, at the Guggenheim-Soho in the last year there was
a technological art exhibit called MediaScape. One of the
entries was a Virtual Reality demo, where two people at a time
would go into Virtual Reality systems. It was very conventional,
with absolutely nothing of interest either from an artistic
point of view or a technical point of view. It would work
equally well in a trade fair as in a museum. It's inconceivable
that, for instance, a company that makes oil paints would be
able to show up at a museum to demonstrate their paints. But an
industrial demo can show up if it's very high-tech, and I think
that's very sad.<P>

There's also an economic issue: many of these technologies tend
to be quite expensive. And this, of course, is the real reason
why that VR thing was there; it had a corporate sponsor, an
Italian communications company. Usually in the art world,
sponsorship is happily accepted, but there's at least some
attempt made, perhaps not successfully, to exert a curatorial
vision that's not entirely driven by the source of funds. In the
case of technology, that's usually compromised.<P>

The notion of getting established artists and giving them
technology also hasn't worked out very well. As a practice, it
seems to be insulting both to technologists and artists, because
it's telling the artist that their value is more as a celebrity
than as someone who has done a particular thing. Then also, it
treats the technology as something that doesn't require any
craft or any devotion or any time to understand.<P>

I'm sorry, I realize I'm talking a lot, but suddenly I'm feeling
the need to say many things.<P>

<B>SA</B>: No please, go on.<P>

<B>JL</B>: One more thing. There's been an idea in 20th-century
art that craft shouldn't be given any sort of explicit
prominence, and that other factors should be valued in art. In
the new technologies, however--and in particular Virtual
Reality--antiquated attitudes of respecting craft above all else
seem appropriate for some period of time. But instead, art
theorists, as well as artists and critics and curators, are
trying to look at the new technology from the point of view of
criticism and social theory, when there isn't even a craft of
using it yet.<P>

I've been designing virtual worlds for art probably longer than
any other individual, and I consider myself to still be a
beginner from a craft point of view. To my knowledge, on the
whole planet right now, there are perhaps only a dozen people
who have undertaken a serious enough study of this matter to
become craftspeople. We need to go through a Renaissance before
we can have a modern art movement with this stuff. Virtual
Reality is genuinely new and different. One of the overwhelming
problems right now when you look at Virtual Reality in the art
world is that it tends to look ugly. And it's not an intentional
ugliness; it's the kind of ugliness that results from the lack
of any tradition of craft.<P>

<B>SA</B>: Kids today are growing up in an environment that is
very rich in visual technology. Maybe they are picking up some
respect for craft?<P>

<B>JL</B>:  Yes, but they don't have much of a sense of visual
aesthetics. They tend to make Web Pages that may be interesting
from an interactive point of view but viciously ugly from a
visual point of view.<P>

There's kind of a symmetry of ignorance here. People in the
visual art community have an attitude that there's no need for
them to spend years understanding interactivity in a deep way.
They can hardly expect the kids who are growing up surrounded by
interactivity to take any more of a sophisticated attitude
towards understanding the visual heritage that they might
otherwise enjoy. It has to go both ways.<P>

<B>SA</B>:  Do you think technology can help the creative world?<P>

<B>JL</B>: I'm an optimist like this, although I think a lot of
outcomes are possible.<P>

First of all, the economics of art might change in a way that I
think would be very healthy. Music, in contrast to the visual
arts, made a transition in the 20th-century, through the
commodity of recordings, to becoming a popularly supported
art-form. In the past, before recordings, musicians who survived
off the public were impoverished, traveling gypsy-type
musicians. Then musicians who were considered 'high art'
musicians lived off of the patronage system in one way or
another. But now we have the ability to sell records and to book
large concert halls. This has created a world of musicians who
can live at an intermediate stage where they have an audience
of, say, ten thousand people instead of just a few patrons. You
don't have to either starve in the street or be patronized by
some king. You can be like a modern jazz musician, selling
10,000 copies for each record and going around to clubs. That
intermediate level is very healthy. It allows an honest
interaction between a public and a musician.<P>

In the visual arts there's never really been anything like that.
We have the superstars, who are able to attract the collectors
and the curators, and then you have the world of amateurs.
There's not anything in between. I would love to see the
Internet supporting an economy for art at an intermediate level,
which could support a much more honest life for visual artists.
I think there's a possibility that could happen. Exactly how, I
can't tell you. Perhaps there will be digital canvases where you
rent images for a month at a time for your home, and you can
select them over the Web and this sort of thing. If it's done as
an open system in which people could rent paintings from artists
all over the world, it could be an extraordinary thing. If it
turns out to be something that Bill Gates puts together where
you rent from his curatorial collection, then nothing much will
have changed.<P>

<B>SA</B>: So if you're hoping for the economics to change,
technology is one way to change it.<P>

<B>JL</B>: Perhaps the only way. Remarkably, people have been
able to change their society through pure thought and
communication. Even in political revolutions, there was always a
technological component that enabled them, and technology can
change society so much more dramatically and quickly. So for
better or worse, technology is going to determine the future of
art--hopefully, for the better.<P>

<B>SA</B>:  What sort of role do you see for art on the World
Wide Web? Is it mainly a promotional tool, or do you see
something beyond that?<P>

<B>JL</B>: The Web was not created by business, it wasn't
created for business, it wasn't created even with business. The
Web is something genuinely new, genuinely wonderful and
revolutionary. As much hype as there's been associated with it,
the real news hasn't been articulated often enough. In all of
history, there's not another example of millions of people doing
something suddenly together, not because they are forced to, but
simply because they wanted to--without advertising, without
compensation, without lines of authority, without any
celebrities. The only thing that happened here was that millions
of people thought this was a good idea, enjoyed the notion of
participating in it, and the Web couldn't have existed without
them choosing to cooperate together in a pleasant, friendly way.
And they simply did it. And that is huge news.<P>

<B>SA</B>: And where do you see the Web heading?<P>

<A HREF="http://www.well.com/user/jaron/modest.html">In the near
term,</A> if you want me to put on my business hat for a second:
making money on the Web is not too likely. Promoting things on
it is possible. Saving money is enormously likely. I think the
possibility of distributing movies and music over it, and all
that, and indeed visual art (if there is ever a transducer on
the other side that's good enough), the digital painting I was
hypothesizing before -- you know, that's going to save enormous
costs.<P>

In the long term, what I hope the Web will become is this
fundamental new type of communication between people.<P>

<B>SA</B>: What kind of communication might it become?<P>

<B>JL</B>:  I have this notion we could be headed toward <A
HREF="http://www.well.
com/user/jaron/columbia.html">post-symbolic communication.</A>
If kids are growing up with an ability to program and make
little virtual micro-worlds according to their own thoughts,
perhaps some day another generation of kids will grow up with a
similar skill but with tools that are much better, so that they
can invent the contents of virtual worlds very quickly, at an
improvisatory rate. If they can do that, and if they have a
shared virtual world interface that's wonderfully inexpensive
and of high quality, that they can all participate in, then, as
they grow up, they have a possibility to invent among themselves
a new form of language. It's really something different than
language. It's a new way to communicate, where people would
directly create a shared world by programming it, by modeling it
in real time, as opposed to merely using words, the
intermediaries that we have to describe things. So it's like
cutting out the middleman of words, and finding a new form of
communication where you directly create shared
reality--real-time, waking-state, improvised dreaming.<P>

That to me is really a very exciting frontier. Think about the
frontiers that are open to us. We can explore space, which might
be very boring--and since it seems to have a pretty severe speed
limit, it could be dull for a long time. We can explore the
Brain, which would be very interesting.<P>

But I think the most vivid, interesting frontier is exploring
the potential of human relationships, particularly in this way I
described. We can ask, "Well, what if we can communicate without
symbols by directly creating shared objective reality in real
time? What would that be like?" That's the most intense
conceivable frontier, because it's built out of the stuff of
experience and communication and self.<P>

<B>SA</B>: You have an idea of vision as something very active.
That notion seems deeply ingrained in everything you do.<P>

<B>JL</B>: Yeah. Well, it's an interesting idea, because it's
one of those ideas that has simultaneous scientific and
aesthetic and clinical implications.<P>

Scientifically, I think that there has been a lack of
realization of the potential of cognitive science, because there
have been overly reductive ways of understanding human
sensation. A great deal of the literature of human sensation has
involved discrimination studies in which you try to isolate the
ability of a person to perceive one particular thing, such as a
number of shades of red. In working with Virtual Reality
systems, we had for the first time a way to make objective
measurements, in a controlled environment, of how the brain uses
the sense organs together to perceive in a holistic way, and to
perceive far more than you would believe if you read the results
of all those discrimination studies. That's one part of it.<P>

Then another part of it has to do with the aesthetics of Virtual
Reality itself. In the first decade or so of Virtual Reality
systems, I frequently heard people talking about it in cinematic
terms. They could not grasp that in Virtual Reality the viewer
is utterly in charge of their point of view, and the profound
implications of that.<P>

In the Entertainment Industry, when companies try to do Virtual
Reality, they still haven't been able to quite accept this. You
still see Virtual Reality systems that might be quite excellent
in many ways but that create astonishing artificial constraints
on what a person can do. This is true, for instance, in the
Disney Aladdin ride, in which everything from the scenario to
the physical design of the device to the art itself is designed
to keep people from being able to look where they wish. It's
really quite an extraordinary, limited aesthetic, which I think
can't be pushed very far. I think ultimately, the dike will
break, and Disney and other cable companies will be forced to
acknowledge that, indeed, people will be in control of their own
vision in the new media.<P>

<B>SA</B>: A lot of the new, interactive media are still built
around strong narrative.<P>

<B>JL</B>: Yeah. Virtual Reality, and probably other interactive
media as well, are somewhat at odds with the idea of narrative.
There's no reason that narrative has to go away. I don't see any
reason for movies to cease to exist, or novels, or any other
form that makes use of narrative. But I think that these new
forms are likely to be more based on other precedents, such as
ritual, social interaction, music improvisation, perhaps even
prayer. There is a whole range of human activities that are
different from narrative that are probably the more appropriate
precedents for what's happening with new media technology.<P>

<B>SA</B>: You're working on a project that you call <A
HREF="http://www.well.com/ user/jaron/art.html">Virtual
Puppetry.</A> Can you tell me a little bit about that?<P>

<B>JL</B>: Sure. That project is transforming now; it might
start to be a little bit less of a puppetry project and more of
a sort of complete Virtual World that's controlled by musicians
simultaneously with a concert. I was trying to create something
that's like halfway between a live music evening and a movie,
where you would have visual characters...they don't exactly go
through a narrative, but interact according to what musicians
do. It's still a very formative project. Working with my
collaborator, <A
HREF="http://www.users.interport.net/~bigtwin/">BigTwin</A>,
we've done some political stuff--we had, for instance, a
keyboard and a saxophone controlling a two-headed puppet which
was a sort of cross between Pat Buchanan and Newt Gingrich. The
keyboard controls what the character does, and the saxophone
controls the flight of a flock of birds that leave their
droppings on the puppet.<P>

And there's one scene with puppets from the Day of the Dead,
which are based on Oaxhacan skeleton puppets. There are also
some very abstract puppets that maybe should properly be called
something else. I've always been interested in using the
performance of music to create architecture in real time; to
play cathedrals with a piano, as it were.<P>

I've also been doing a lot of work with dance. I have a ballet
in progress now which is called The Thinning of the Veil. I'm
using some of the same techniques with dance. I'm working with
puppets that dance with the dancers, or have the dancers be able
to use virtual props as part of the dance--that sort of thing.<P>

All this is extraordinarily craft-intensive. I'm just starting
to learn about the art of movement dynamics in a Virtual puppet,
for instance. Because where there's a joint in a puppet, the way
that joint moves is not a simple matter. You're simulating the
muscles and tendons. The details of the motion have an enormous
effect on what the sensibility of that puppet is, and what it
feels like.<P>

I suppose what I'm doing with the puppets is developing an art
of creating new creature motion, of invented movement dynamics
of imaginary creatures. This kind of thing has been done a
little by special effects people, but in working with real-time
creatures I think it's pretty new territory.<P>

<B>SA</B>: A recent movie, "Synthetic Pleasures," made the case
for a link between VR and body piercing, citing them as two ways
that people are reshaping themselves. I notice that <A
HREF="http://www.well.com/user/jaron/art.html">piercing imagery
</A>shows up in some of your art--does this idea ring true to
you?<P>

<B>JL</B>: I was teaching at the San Francisco Art Institute at
a time of exceedingly pierced pupils. There was one class where
every student was radically pierced. One time, a student stood
up and proposed that Virtual Reality is connected to piercing,
in that both involve both a malleability and an increase in
willful control of the nature of one's own form. She blurted
out, "Like, let's talk about my labial piercing." And I remember
saying, "No, let's not; that's really okay."<P>

One of my long-term collaborators in scientific work is a
plastic surgeon named Joe Rosen. We've talked about sort of
possible futures of plastic surgery. One of the things that I
had imagined is that sometime in the future, instead of just
piercing themselves, kids would be able to change their bodies
enough to invent new genders entirely. They might invent a new
set of genitalia that can only join in threes, for instance.<P>

It's a funny time we live in. That sort of thing is going to be
a real possibility, and at the same time we're starting to
understand more and more about the biological origins of human
behavior. So we are moving in both directions at once. We're
uncovering more of Nature's construction in ourselves even as
we're deconstructing our own constructions that were on top of
it. Sadly, if those two processes were taken to their
conclusion, there wouldn't be much of us left!<P>

<BR>
The <A HREF="http://brainop.media.mit.edu/libretto/todarticle.html">Brain Opera</A> is
a new interactive performance designed and composed by
<A HREF="http://casr.www.media.mit.edu/groups/casr/machover.html">Tod Machover</A> of the MIT Media Lab. It makes
use of custom-made electronic instruments, an extension of the
electronically enhanced
"<A HREF="http://brainop.media.mit.edu/text-site/growth/tech/hyperinstruments.html">hyperinstruments</A>"
that Machover has been developing over the past decade. The Brain Opera is
currently being performed at Lincoln Center in New York City, but it is also
a global performance that is wired into the Internet. <P>
<A HREF="http://brainop.media.mit.edu/text-site/intro/overview.html">Each performance</A> of
the Brain Opera consists of two parts: an introductory period during which
the audience gets to explore, experiment with and play with a variety of
Machover's instruments (including large percussive devices that resemble
neurons), and a more formal, 45-minute musical event orchestrated by three
conductors. The music incorporates recordings just made by the incoming
audience, along with material and musical contributions from participants on
the World Wide Web. The Brain Opera will <A HREF="http://brainop.media.mit.edu/tour-sites.html">tour</A> after it completes its
run at Lincoln Center on August 3. <P>
SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN caught up with Tod Machover during a lull in his frantic
schedule (the Brain Opera takes place every hour on the hour from 1 PM to 7
PM daily). He shared with us some of his vision of melding music, science
and technology:<P>
<BR>
<B>SA:</B>
You have stated that the Brain Opera was inspired by ideas from
<A HREF="http://www.ai.mit.edu/people/minsky/minsky.html">Marvin Minsky</A>, also at
the Media Lab. How does Minsky's philosophy of the mind find its way into
the Brain Opera?<P>
<B>TM:</B>
Yes, Minsky is at the heart of the Brain Opera; the
"<A HREF="http://brainop.media.mit.edu/text-site/libretto/libretto.html">libretto</A>"
is taken from interviews I've done with him over the past couple years. For
a long time I've found his ideas about music very stimulating, although they
are not widely known. I first contacted Minsky when I was a student at the
Juliard School in New York, some 20 years ago. I was a fan of his, I wanted
to meet him. Later, when I had moved to IRCAM in Paris, he agreed to come
and give a colloquium. He gave a fascinating discussion about Beethoven's
music as a kind of "learning machine."<P>
There are some basic questions about music that people almost never address:
Why did music arise in all cultures? How does music evolve? What happens to
the mind when we are listening to music? Nobody talks about music as having
intrinsic meaning, how it engages the mind. How do nonverbal reactions
connect to the world? Minsky is one of the few people to look at emotions
and music and seek the connections. He asks the bold questions about how it
may work. <P>
People working on artificial intelligence (AI) learned quickly that we did
not know enough about the mind to make a convincing model of it. Minsky has
provided a general model that changes how we think about the mind. He sees
the mind not as an orchestra, with a conductor directing all of the action,
but rather the opposite: it is a bunch of agents running around who
collectively find a way to organize. My interest lies in understanding the
balance between central organization and anarchy--in our minds and in our
lives. The Brain Opera is intended to encourage audiences to reflect on this
process.<P>
<B>SA:</B>
In what sense is this performance an "opera"? Why did you use that very
traditional-sounding term in the name?<P>
<B>TM:</B>
I deliberately wanted the title to be provocative. And I wanted to put those
words together, "brain" and "opera." There are a lot of things I want people
to think about, a lot of dichotomies I want them to reconsider. The old
right brain-left brain gobbledygook is not the way that people really think.
The split between art and technology is another old division, another false
one. <P>
At last night's performance [of Machover's "Hyperstring Trilogy," which
includes one piece for electronically enhanced cello], everything worked
fine with the technology--what went wrong was that the cello's A string
broke at the very beginning of the piece. It was the one thing I hadn't
anticipated, and it made me realize that strings are technology too. <P>
My message is to forget about dichotomies. The Brain Opera is an opera, even
if it does not tell a story in the usual way. It is a psychological journey
with voices--so I do consider it an opera.<P>
<B>SA: </B>
How have audiences responded to the Brain Opera so far?<P>
<B>TM:</B>
We are watching their reactions carefully. So far I haven't had a chance to
watch the audience playing with the instruments; I'll have a chance to do
that in the coming days.<P>
The audience has been very diverse, with lots of older people as well as a
lot of kids. Interestingly, the older folks have been especially active with
the instruments. In general, the people who come to this with an open mind
will enjoy it more.<P>
We have misjudged one area: people want more information ahead of time about
what to expect and what to do when they enter the "experience space." We
went to an extreme in making the experience self-explanatory and letting
people learn themselves what to do with the instruments. Now we are
providing more information--but we're doing it personally, with guides not
with written instructions.<P>
<B>SA:</B>
What do you see as the primary rationales (whether aesthetic or
philosophical) for combining music and interactive electronic technology? <P>
<B>TM:</B>
There is a deep reason for interactivity. Works of art should be
stimulating. They should wake people up rather than acting like a sedative.
I hope that people will come out of the Brain Opera asking for more from
their art. <P>
The goal is for the audience to get involved with the performance. We don't
want the audience to pay attention to the technology. In fact, we've made a
great effort to keep all the wires out of sight.<P>
We are searching for something between top-down authority and complete
anarchy--the interesting balance in between. We live in a very fragmented
world in which people often feel out of control. What we are doing here is
more than putting together notes of music; we are trying to touch people's
lives. The hope is that art can provide a model for how people can come
together and interact in other aspects of their lives. <P>
The traditional concert model has all the work done on stage, finished ahead
of time and then organized by the conductor--it is like the traditional
model of the mind. As a result, of all the arts, music requires the most
work because the imagination has to fill in all the details. The seriousness
with which people approach music is frightening; we need to do something
because people are forgetting how to listen. <P>
<B>SA:</B>
How do the ideas in the Brain Opera extend your previous work with
electronically enhanced "hyperinstruments"?<P>
<B>TM:</B>
My work on hyperinstruments started with simple instruments, like the piano.
Developing a hypercello for Yo-Yo Ma proved much more difficult. We placed
electrical sensors on the bow but the readings kept coming out weird. It
turned out that his own body electricity was affecting the sensors.<P>
About five years ago, that experience gave me the idea of making instruments
for audiences, instruments that respond to peoples' movements and gestures.
The technology could respond directly to what you intend to do; it is a way
of bringing music to people who don't normally get involved with this stuff.
That is what the Brain Opera grew out of.<P>
<B>SA:</B>
Do you consider interactivity to be an important element for the future of
music? For instance, is this classical music's equivalent of the electric
guitar--a way to get people from all walks of life excited by and involved
in music?<P>
<B>TM:</B>
It is really hard to say at this point. This technology is so new, it is
premature to answer. One crucial direction in the arts is to break down
boundaries between audiences and the creator, between the finished work and
the set of possibilities of what that work could be. This goal is important
on a practical level because we must find a way to get audiences to wake up.
Any way that it can be done is worth exploring. <P>
One of the great things about technology is that it can break down barriers,
such as the difficulty of mastering a musical instrument or the mystery of
learning musical technique. Technology lets people tap skills that they
already had; it lets people use their intuition to make creative decisions
without having the detailed knowledge. It will change the way that we think
about concerts.<P>
<B>SA:</B>
Will you be exploring further the possibilities of music and performance on
the Internet? Are there things you would have liked to do in the Brain Opera
that the technology does not yet allow?<P>
<B>TM:</B>
Right now, you still have to come to the performance to experience the Brain
Opera. I would love to do a home opera next. It might be like elevator
music, present right where you happen to be, but turned into something
uplifting rather than mind-numbing.<P>
The Internet is slightly puzzling because it is changing so fast. There are
lots of problems still; it is quite primitive. The big advantage of the
Internet is that it is the only medium we have that allows large numbers of
people to be in a collective space together. For getting music or any kind
of information out, broadcasting is better. But for getting instantaneous
response, we need the Internet. <P>
This is a transitional period. It is still a little too hard to transmit
sounds, a little too hard to download instruments [which the Brain Opera
allows], a little too hard to show who is online. But the time when we can
do these things is not that far off. With the Brain Opera, we've put our
fingers on most of the interesting issues. We will be experimenting further
with them over the next two years.<P>
We have to find a way to make public places and the home more connected. I
think that will happen, and both spaces will be richer for it. Los Angeles
has the right idea: the people developing the new concert hall there are
finding ways to connect the hall to the local schools. We need more of that
kind of thinking.<P>

<BR>
It was a classic match of man versus machine: this past February, <BR>
world champion chess player Gary Kasparov pitted his wits against <BR>
<A HREF="http://www.chess.ibm.park.org/">Deep Blue</A>, a computer designed by a team of computer scientists <BR>
from IBM. Deep Blue took the first game, but Kasparov recovered and <BR>
ended up winning the match 4 games to 2. Three weeks later, John <BR>
Horgan of Scientific American interviewed the Deep Blue team at the <BR>
IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, New <BR>
York. <BR>
<BR>
Present during the interview were Chung-Jen Tan, manager of <BR>
the Deep Blue team; Feng-hsiung Hsu, who designed Deep Blue's <BR>
predecessor, Deep Thought, when he was a graduate student at <BR>
Carnegie Mellon University in the mid-1980s; Murray Campbell, who <BR>
also worked on Deep Thought at Carnegie Mellon and is the IBM <BR>
team's best chess player; Joseph Hoane, a programmer; and Marcy <BR>
Holle, an IBM public relations manager. Absent were Jerry Brody, <BR>
another programmer who has been delayed by an ice storm; and <BR>
Deep Blue itself, a brace of refrigerator-sized IBM SP 2 computers, <BR>
each containing 16 parallel processors, which remained housed in its <BR>
room elsewhere in the building. <BR>
<BR>
A slightly edited transcript of the interview follows.<BR>
<BR>
<HR WIDTH=40%>
<BR>
<B>SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN:</B> Some news reports suggested that Deep Blue 
might have lost the match because of human error, such as your 
tinkering with Deep Blue's program between match one, which Deep 
Blue won, and match two, which the computer lost.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Campbell:</B> &quot;That had no influence... there were no errors of
any 
consequence in the second game.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<B>Hoane:</B> &quot;Yeah, the only human error was the draw in game 
five.&quot; [Early in game five, Kasparov offered Deep Blue a draw. The
computer's managers rejected the offer, and Kasparov went on to win <BR>
the match.]<BR>
<BR>
<B>Campbell:</B> &quot;But that's not a human error. The computer doesn't
<BR>
ever accept draws. If we want to, we can accept a draw, but it will never accept a draw. It's in the rules.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<B>Tan:</B> &quot;Offering of draws generally happens when things are 
very close, unless it's a repetition of some sort. Otherwise the 
computer will just keep going. [Kasparov] offered a draw because he 
saw he had no chance of winning and he wanted to do better next 
game... We just made a decision.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<B>Campbell:</B> &quot;If we'd won everybody would have said we were 
brilliant.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<B>SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN:</B> So you are not second-guessing yourself 
about your strategy during the match with Kasparov?<BR>
<BR>
<B>Campbell: </B>&quot;At the time we did what we thought was the right
thing to do... &quot;<BR>
<BR>
<B>Tan:</B> &quot;It was really early in the game, move 23, and there was
no indication one way or the other about which side had the 
advantage.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<B>Hoane: </B>&quot;You've got to understand how tough it is for us to get
a 
good game out of a grandmaster. They don't give you their best 
unless there's money on the line.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<B>Campbell:</B> &quot;When you're playing against the world champion, 
and you're not losing, you might as well play it out.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<B>SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN:</B> Was Kasparov finding weaknesses in Deep
Blue over the course of the match?<BR>
<BR>
<B>Tan:</B> &quot;Not only weaknesses. He found how strong the machine 
was, therefore he changed the style of play and the strategy of play. 
He said the first game he lost was the best thing that ever happened 
to him, because otherwise [his initial strategy] would have come back 
to haunt him in later games.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<B>Campbell:</B> &quot;He might have lost at a critical time later on instead
of in the beginning when he could recover.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<B>SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN:</B> So if the match had continued, would 
Kasparov have kept getting winning more and more easily?<BR>
<BR>
<B>Tan:</B> &quot;It's hard to tell, because he could get more tired and
nervous... and [Deep Blue] will stay very strong. And he may get a 
couple of games where, if he loses to Deep Blue, he would feel 
tremendous pressure on him.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<B>Hoane:</B> &quot;Plus he may have learned everything he could learn [in
the first six games]. It's not clear.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<B>Campbell:</B> &quot;It's also possible that we could change the program
too [to alter its strategy between games]. We were very conservative 
about changing the program, because in such a short time when you 
make a change you can't really test it thoroughly. But in theory, if we
see the same thing happening over and over, we can change it. We 
can patch holes. We didn't do that, but we are allowed to.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<B>SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN:</B> Did you think you would win the match?<BR>
<BR>
<B>Campbell:</B> &quot;Some people were predicting Kasparov would win 
six-zero, and some people were predicting we would win by a large 
margin. I had strong feelings going into the match that we would be 
as good as Kasparov. The problem going into the match is, the 
computer and the world champion just have such different strengths, 
different weaknesses. It's hard to see how this is going to match up. 
The computer has the power of calculating..., being 'like God,' in 
certain positions, to use Kasparov's words. And Kasparov has all this 
intuition and understanding of chess and all the things that he's good 
at. It wasn't clear how it was going to come together, what strengths 
would play against what weaknesses. And the answer is, it happened 
many different ways, and it looks like a respectable, perhaps equal 
challenge we gave him.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<B>SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN: </B>In an article published in SCIENTIFIC 
AMERICAN in October 1990, Hsu, Campbell and two colleagues that 
are no longer involved in the chess project predicted that the 
computer would have a rating of 3,200, much higher than Kasparov's 
rating of 2,800, by 1992. Why hasn't that happened yet?
<BR>
<B>Tan:</B> &quot;The truth of the matter is, our project did take longer
than expected.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<B>Campbell:</B> &quot;Also, we never predicted a 3200 rating for 
ourselves. There's a graph in the SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN article 
which a lot of people misinterpreted... There were some very careful 
words, we thought, qualifying that [prediction]. 'If present trends 
continue, and assuming this and assuming that.'&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<B>Tan:</B> &quot;We went into this match with the goal of playing 
somewhere like 2,800... And I think we did pretty well, as far as 
getting to that level... We didn't win the match, but it was a very 
close encounter, especially the first game. If we patched up some 
potholes, we could have easily turned the match around.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<B>SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN:</B> Does the computer always make the same 
move when faced with a given position?<BR>
<BR>
<B>Hsu:</B> &quot;There is some randomization by the fact we are doing a
<BR>
parallel search... Sometime the same position, the same program, the 
same hardware, everything the same, start it again, it might behave 
differently.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<B>Campbell:</B> &quot;Minor changes in initial conditions produce large
changes in outcome.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
[MARCY HOLLE, the IBM public relations spokesperson, suggests that 
the Deep Blue team explain why Deep Blue made certain moves in its 
first game against Kasparov.]<BR>
<BR>
<B>Campbell:</B> &quot;It's hard to explain what it did, because it is a
20 
billion move search, or something like that.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<B>Hsu:</B> &quot;And we can only see... one line of moves.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<B>Tan:</B> &quot;... It's hard to even just record and look at 20 billion
board positions. So the computer just prints out the principal line of 
its search. The machine is very accurate [in its analysis of certain 
situations], because it looks at all possible moves up to 12 ply and 
others down further. So when Gary was trying to checkmate Deep 
Blue at the end of game one, the computer just saw every move and 
was one step ahead of him [and could ignore the threat]... A human 
player... would have been scared.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<B>Hoane:</B> &quot;The machine is always blithe.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<B>Campbell:</B> &quot;You can't bluff it.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<B>Hsu: </B>&quot;You can say that Kasparov lost the first game, maybe,
because of lack of experience in playing with a machine. And we lost 
the last two games because of lack of experience...&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<B>SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN:</B> Will Deep Blue and Kasparov play again 
anytime soon?<BR>
<BR>
<B>Holle:</B> &quot;We're negotiating that with him at the moment. He 
wants it, he asked for it.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<B>Tan:</B> &quot;He got more exposure out of the match than any other 
match.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<B>SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN:</B> Why has it taken so long for a computer to 
surpass all humans in chess, which seems like such a perfect game 
for a computer to play?<BR>
<BR>
<B>CAMPBELL:</B> &quot;The reason chess is interesting is, it's not perfect
<BR>
for a human and it's not perfect for a computer. It's somewhere in 
the middle. Games like checkers... at this point have been mastered 
by a machine, [whereas in the game of Go] people are so far ahead 
it's just not interesting. But chess is an interesting game because 
there are elements of calculation, there are elements of intuition and 
pattern recognition, all the traditional AI [artificial intelligence] stuff,
and all sort of clashing. It hasn't been resolved one way or the other 
yet.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<B>SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN:</B> Does the difficulty that you have had in 
beating human players in chess suggest something about the limits of 
artificial intelligence (AI)? Aren't other problems in AI, such as 
speech recognition, much harder than chess?<BR>
<BR>
<B>Tan:</B> &quot;This chess project is not AI. In the early days people
used 
chess to demonstrate AI techniques, but in the late 1970s and early 
'80s people started to realize that [if you reduce chess to a problem 
in pure computation rather than one of judgment and intuition], then 
you can really get much better results from a computer. Before you 
understand the problem, you call it AI, but once you really 
understand it you can reduce that to a computation algorithm.&quot;
<BR>
<B>SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN:</B> If chess can be reduced to computation, why
has it been so hard to beat a human like Kasparov?<BR>
<BR>
<B>Campbell:</B> &quot;Because there are some things that people can do
that we haven't been able to reduce to computation.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<B>Tan:</B> &quot;And it's also taken this long for the computer technology
to give us the computational power to do that. Without the 
architecture, without the parallel processor we developed, you 
cannot do it.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<B>Campbell:</B> &quot;The amazing thing is that it requires that much 
computation to get close to beating the best people... Nobody would 
have guessed in the mid-1950s that it would take 100 million 
positions per second to play close to the level of the world 
champion.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<B>Hoane:</B> &quot;The techniques that tried to mimic human judgment 
failed miserably. We still don't know how to do that at all.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<B>SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN:</B> How long will the Deep Blue project 
continue?<BR>
<BR>
<B>Tan:</B> &quot;This is really part of the overall research to understand
how to use parallel processing's computational capability to solve 
complex problems. We have many activities going on, and chess is 
one of them. When we get to a point where we think we understand 
enough from chess to derive benefit from it for improving our 
understanding of parallel processing, we will stop. Gradually, when 
chess is no longer interesting, we will completely stop and move onto 
other areas. But it will be a smooth transition. It will not be 
something that stops tomorrow.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<B>Campbell: </B>&quot;When we say, 'Chess is no longer interesting,' we
mean, 'Chess is no longer interesting from a computer-science 
research point of view.' Obviously we have no intention of making 
chess uninteresting for chess players!&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<B>SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN:</B> How do you feel about the press portraying 
Deep Blue as the modern equivalent of the machine that took over 
the job of John Henry, the legendary railroad worker?
<BR>
<B>Hoane:</B> &quot;A lot of miners don't have black lung disease because
machines do the work for them.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<B>Hsu:</B> &quot;... This is not just a simple tool like the steam engine...
This is a big challenge from a computer science point of view. When 
Gary won the match, everybody applauded, and we applauded with a 
different perspective, because we knew what Gary went through...&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<B>Hoane:</B> &quot;I got one little gee whiz number. How long has 
[Kasparov] been playing chess? Twenty-eight years or so. And how 
long have we been playing chess [in total]? About 25 years... The 
human effort that went into this event was the same, in a sense...&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<B>Tan:</B> &quot;It is really just one person using a brain versus many
people using a tool.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<B>SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN:</B> When will Deep Blue beat Kasparov?<BR>
<BR>
<B>Tan:</B> &quot;We already did once!&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<B>Hsu:</B> &quot;There's always an element of chance, In fact, even in
this 
match we had some good chance of winning....It could happen next 
time even with the same machine...&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<B>SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN:</B> Is it just a matter of time before Deep Blue
defeats Kasparov easily? [Everyone nods]<BR>
<BR>
<B>Tan:</B> &quot;In this match we used a 32-node parallel processor...
We have in this building a 128-node parallel processor. We did not use 
that one, because it is very expensive... [We would have] to stop all 
other research in this building. That's one thing. Secondly, our goal is
just to get to the level where we can play Gary... We did that. If we 
really wanted 100-percent certainty that we will beat him in a 
match, we would have used 128  or 512[-node] parallel system to get 
extra insurance. But we didn't do that. So the technology is here 
today, in terms of computational strength.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<B>Campbell:</B> &quot;If we hired ten grandmasters for two years to help
us and we got the biggest machines and spent hundreds of millions 
of dollars, I think we could have done it. But what we're learning just
as much from what we're doing.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<B>Holle:</B> &quot;Chess is the perfect model for taking parallel processing
and understanding it, for taking it to various applications. That's 
what this is all about. Because, this is IBM.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<B>Tan:</B> &quot;That's why we didn't go for the big machine. That wasn't
our goal.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<B>SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN:</B> Have any of you beaten Deep Blue?<BR>
<BR>
<B>Hoane:</B> &quot;I saw Campbell beat Deep Thought [Deep Blue's 
predecessor] once, in our entire career. And I don't need to be beaten 
by Deep Blue. Any cheap commercial program can thrash me.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<B>SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN:</B> Do any of you have any strong thoughts on 
whether computers can think?<BR>
<BR>
<B>Campbell:</B> &quot;I don't think chess playing has any bearing on 
whether computers can think. Just because a computer can play 
chess doesn't mean it can think. Thinking is a very difficult word.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<B>SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN:</B> Do you think there are any upper bounds to 
what computers can do?<BR>
<BR>
<B>Hoane:</B> &quot;Computers keep doubling [in speed] every 18 months.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<B>Campbell:</B> &quot;But you can't go below the size of an electron [when
constructing data-storage devices, and] an electron can't go faster 
than the speed of light.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<B>Hoane:</B> &quot;Yeah, but 20 years ago I could have made up some 
limit that you can't pack too many devices in a certain space...&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<B>Campbell:</B> &quot;It's obvious to me that exponential growth won't
continue for the next 10,000 years.&quot; [Everybody laughs.]<BR>
<BR>
<B>Tan:</B> &quot;You can talk about the so-called upper limits, the electron
and so forth... But advances will be made in other areas, such as 
software... It's hard to say where the limit will be.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<B>SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN:</B> Will computers someday be able to emulate 
every human attribute?<BR>
<BR>
<B>Campbell:</B> &quot;Of course, in principle. You just emulate [the brain]
neuron for neuron, device for device, but that's like centuries in the 
future.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<B>Tan:</B> &quot;It's more than that. Yeah, you can substitute electrons
for neurons, but the brain is more than  hardware. It's all the software 
and everything else. I'm not a psychologist or a neurologist, but I'm 
sure they don't understand those problems either.&quot;<P>

<CENTER><B>WELFARE REFORM</B></CENTER>

<P>I am always sorry to see <I>Scientific American</I> stray from science
into politics, as you did in October 1996 with the article "Single Mothers
and Welfare," by Ellen L. Bassuk, Angela Browne and John C. Buckner. You
are not very good at it, which perhaps is not surprising, since scientists
are not in general any better at such issues than anyone else. There is no
reason, though, why people with credentials in psychiatry and psychology
should not say something sensible about welfare economics. But when an
article is obviously a tendentious piece of political pleading, you should
at least attempt to solicit some contrary remarks from actual economists.

<P><I>KELLEY L. ROSS Los Angeles Valley College</I>
<HR WIDTH=50>
<P>I read "Single Mothers and Welfare" with great interest because
I spent seven years as a social worker in a public welfare
agency in Alabama. I left the field of social work, however,
because of a profound sense of disillusionment with the welfare
system. One problem I never see addressed is that welfare
bureaucracies actually benefit from having unsuccessful clients.
If a caseworker gets her clients to find jobs and become
self-supporting, she works herself out of a job. The authors of
the study-who reveal their own bias against the recent welfare
bill, labeling it "draconian"-fail to address the problems with
a system that encourages self-destructive behavior and a
bureaucracy that requires more clients so it can exist and grow.

<P><I>KATHERINE OWEN WATSON Vestavia Hills, Ala.</I>
<HR WIDTH=50>
<P>Bassuk, Browne and Buckner ignore the real inroads states such
as Massachusetts, Wisconsin, Indiana and Oklahoma have made in
reducing welfare dependency by limiting the time over which they
will pay benefits. We have done a terrible disservice to welfare
recipients by allowing them to become dependent on a monthly
check and expecting nothing in return. I hope those days are
over.

<P><I>WILLIAM D. STEPANEK Mahopac, N.Y.</I>
<HR WIDTH=50>
<P>Bassuk and Buckner reply:

<P><I><B>The economist David Ellwood once observed that "everyone hates
welfare." Even so, extremely poor mothers and children cannot be
left scrambling to survive without a safety net. We support
welfare reform, but sadly, reform has typically been based on
stereotypes and myths, rather than rigorously collected
information about the realities of life for poor women and
children. We have attempted to fill the gap in empirical
knowledge with our epidemiological study. Although issues such
as welfare cannot be addressed without discussing values, that
does not diminish the scientific rigor of our study or the
critical need for relevant research about social issues. We
agree that bureaucracies tend to be self-interested and
paradoxically at odds with those they serve. Sometimes, as with
welfare, the only solution is to overhaul the system.
Unfortunately, states have not evaluated the effects of current
reforms. Our home state of Massachusetts, for example, has been
touted for reducing its welfare rolls by 10,000, but no one
knows what has happened to these people; certainly, not all of
them are working.</I></B><P>

<HR SIZE=12><CENTER><B>ALTERNATIVE VIEWS</B></CENTER>

<P>Gary Stix's profile of Wayne B. Jonas and the Office of
Alternative Medicine ["Probing Medicine's Outer Reaches," News
and Analysis, October 1996] was colored by the prejudice often
advanced against homeopathy in the U.S., which stands in
contrast to more accepting attitudes in Europe. Stix chose to
describe the OAM in the peculiar American landscape of personal
energy, harmonic resonance, assorted nostrums, potions and
electromagnetic-field generators. There is no doubt that the
range of therapies within alternative medicine strains
credulity, but recognizing those therapies that have been
assessed by published clinical trials is a simple way to cut
through this complexity.

<P><I>NORMAN K. GRANT Michigan Technological University</I>
<HR WIDTH=50>
<P>Congratulations for your objective appraisal of alternative
medicine and the director of the OAM. The terms "alternative"
and "complementary" themselves are obscurations meant to suggest
that unproved treatments are acceptable in place of standard
medical care. Those of us on the front lines of medicine have
seen the results of uncritical public acceptance of appealing
but unproved claims.

<P><I>EDWARD H. DAVIS Professor Emeritus, College of Medicine, State
University of New York at Brooklyn</I>
<P>

<HR SIZE=12><CENTER><B>MINIATURE MICROBES</B></CENTER>

<P>In the story by Corey S. Powell and W. Wayt Gibbs discussing the
possibility that fossilized bacteria may have been found in a
meteorite from Mars ["Bugs in the Data?" News and Analysis,
October 1996], Carl R. Woese is quoted as saying, "These
structures contain one one-thousandth the volume of the smallest
terrestrial bacteria." He expresses doubt that anything so small
could possibly be alive. But in another article in the same
issue, "Microbes Deep inside the Earth," James K. Fredrickson
and Tullis C. Onstott explain that when water or other nutrients
are in short supply, bacteria stay alive by shrinking to one
one-thousandth of their normal volume and lowering their
metabolism. Could the shrinkage of such subterranean bacteria
provide a model for the very small size of the alleged Martian
bacteria?

<BR><B>FEBRUARY 1947</B>

<P>"Uranium metal could be used as an international monetary
standard to replace the silver and gold that have traditionally
set the world's standards of values. Atomic fission can convert
a part at least of any mass of uranium directly into energy, and
energy, the ability to do work, is suggested as a far more
logical basis of economic value than any possessed by the
precious metals. Uranium's hardness and the ease with which it
oxidizes preclude its use in actual coins. However, the various
proposals for international control of fissionable materials
might lend themselves to an international paper currency backed
by centrally controlled uranium metal."

<P>"Chemists have finally succeeded in taming fluorine, the most
unruly of the elements. The first commercial fluorine plastic is
a polymer of tetrafluoroethylene--a translucent, waxy white
plastic, stable up to 250 degrees Centigrade. The chemical
resistance of Teflon, as the material is called, is outstanding.
Because of its cost, however, the field for Teflon is limited.
In addition to its use in electrical equipment, it will very
likely find applications in the chemical industry as a gasket
and as chemically inert tubing."

<P><HR>

<BR><B>FEBRUARY 1897</B>

<P>"Miss Lilias Hamilton, who is private physician of the Emir of
Afghanistan, has succeeded in convincing her royal patient of
the utility of vaccination, says the Medical Record. Smallpox
ravages Afghanistan every spring, killing about one-fifth of the
children. The Emir has decreed obligatory vaccination in all his
states. The order has been given to construct stables and to
raise vaccine heifers. Miss Hamilton has been deputed to
organize a general vaccination service."

<P>"At the bottom of the ocean there is an enormous pressure. At
2,500 fathoms the pressure is thirty times more powerful than
the steam pressure of a locomotive when drawing a train. As late
as 1880 a leading zoologist explained the existence of deep-sea
animals at such depths by assuming that their bodies were
composed of solids and liquids of great density, and contained
no air. This is not the case with deep-sea fish, which are
provided with air-inflated swimming bladders. Members of this
unfortunate class are liable to become victims to the unusual
accident of falling upward, and no doubt meet with a violent
death soon after leaving their accustomed level."

<P>"In New York a heavy snow storm is the signal for the marshaling
of all the forces of the Department of Street Cleaning. For days
a solid procession of carts, filled with snow, is seen in
progress down the side streets toward the river, where it is
dumped. There have been many experiments directed toward the
elimination of the bulky material by some less clumsy and
expensive method. Here we illustrate a naphtha-burning snow
melter recently tested in New York. The flame of the naphtha and
air comes into direct contact with the snow, melting it
instantly. Fourteen men are necessary to feed the insatiable
monster."

<P><HR>

<BR><B>FEBRUARY 1847</B>

<P>"More about the famine--A Liverpool paper states that the
arrivals at that port of the starving Irish exceeds 1,000 a day;
mostly women and children. In Ireland the guardians of the 'Poor
Law' have been compelled to close the doors of the workhouses
[poorhouses], and in their own words, to 'adopt the awful
alternative of excluding hundreds of diseased and starving
creatures who are daily seeking for admission.' Two hundred and
sixty have died in three months in one house. It is found
impossible to provide coffins for the dead; and the bodies are
thrown into the pits without any other covering than the rags
they wore when they lived. 400,000 men gladly accepted
employment at 10 pence per day, with which many support
families, notwithstanding the high price of provisions."

<P>"A Berlin writer states of the Panama project that Prince Louis
Napoleon is about to proceed to Central America, for the purpose
of putting in progress the work of uniting the two oceans. The
celebrated geographer, Professor Charles Ritter, has
communicated to the geographical society of Berlin the project
of the Prince, which, it appears, he conceived and prepared
during his imprisonment at Ham."

<H3>Forum: The Benefits and Ethics of Animal Research</H3><P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The ways in which scientists experiment on animals--and the question
of whether they should do so at all--have been hotly controversial for decades,
inside and outside the laboratory. An animal-loving public despises inhumane
abuses of creatures, yet it also values the biomedical progress that results.
Researchers defend animal experimentation as a necessary evil but can also be
personally troubled by the suffering they cause. These articles crystallize some
of the arguments voiced on both sides and look at the forces driving change in
animal experimentation. With an introduction by Andrew N. Rowan. <P>

<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=336>

With two spacecraft now en route to Mars and another 18 interplanetary probes in
various stages of design and construction around the world, solar system science
seems poised on the verge of a golden age. Public enthusiasm, fueled by possible
evidence of ancient life on Mars as well as startling images from the Galileo
probe now orbiting Jupiter, is higher than it has been since the Apollo era. Yet
the outlook is not as rosy as it appears at first glance. Russian and European
space research will take years to recover from the loss of Mars 96, a seven-ton
craft loaded with 22 instruments that crashed into the Pacific last November. And
in the U.S., political repercussions from Russia's failure to make progress on
its principal contribution to the International Space Station, together with
planned budget cuts at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration,
threaten missions, including one scheduled for 2005 to return rocks from Mars to
Earth. Torrence V. Johnson of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.,
who heads the team of Galileo investigators, says "projections that fit within
the push for a balanced budget are very, very bad for space science."<P>

The crisis comes at a time when reasons for exploration of the solar system are
stronger than they have ever been. Even before David S. McKay and his colleagues
at the NASA Johnson Space Center announced last summer that meteorite ALH84001
had features suggestive of Martian bacteria, NASA was redefining its objectives
to take into account scientific developments. The new focus, which has widespread
support among scientists, is the quest to understand the origins of planetary
systems and the environments that might support life.<P>

Researchers have collected evidence that life thrives on Earth in almost any
place that has usable energy and liquid water, notes Claude R. Canizares, head of
the space studies board of the National Research Council. Moreover, it now seems
that life appeared on Earth within a geologically brief 100 million years after
the planet cooled down enough for organic molecules to evolve, some 3.9 billion
years ago. Those insights suggest life might spring up relatively easily and so
encourage searches for life elsewhere. Besides Mars, Saturn's moon Titan and
Jupiter's moon Europa--which may have water oceans containing organic matter--are
considered good prospects.<P>

Some groups of enthusiasts, such as the National Space Society, are riding the
wave of excitement to argue for a crash program to send humans to Mars. Fossil
hunting cannot be done by a robot, asserts the society's chairman, Robert Zubrin.
But Canizares points out that the first mission to Mars to include humans will
certainly contaminate the planet enough to cast doubt on the origin of any
organic molecules found there later. He therefore urges a vigorous robotic
program to explore Mars and other solar system bodies before astronauts
arrive.<P>

The White House has apparently accepted that argument. A somewhat ambiguous
<A HREF="http://www.aiaa.org/policy/nat-space-policy.html">National Space Policy</A> issued last September endorses both human and robotic
exploration but backs away from former president George Bush's earlier announced
goal of sending astronauts to Mars. The formula appears to be an attempt to
combine support for near-term robotic exploration of the solar system with
continued funding for the space station, which the Clinton administration sees as
bringing important foreign policy benefits.<P>

<table cellpadding=1 align=center width=336><tr><td><IMG

mineral mixtures when seen by Galileo in the infrared (right).</FONT></center></td>
</tr></table><P>

Yet NASA scientists say the budget cuts facing their agency put even relatively
inexpensive robotic missions in jeopardy. Budget projections that the
administration announced almost a year ago envisage reducing NASA's cash burn
rate from $13.8 billion in 1996 to $11.6 billion in 2000, with a gradual increase
thereafter. "I don't think they can do a simple sample return within the planned
budget," says Louis D. Friedman, executive director of the Planetary Society, an
organization that promotes space exploration.<P>

The small robotic planetary missions that NASA has favored since the loss of its
Mars Observer probe in 1993 typically cost some $200 million a year to run. The
agency spends, in contrast, about $5.5 billion annually on human spaceflight,
including $2.1 billion for the space station, a figure capped by agreement with
Congress. There is no leeway for diverting funds from human spaceflight to
planetary science, because the space station is already falling behind schedule.
Indeed, some observers fear that woes besetting the program could add to the
pressure on planetary missions. "I am worried that if extra funds have to be
provided for the space station, should it come to that, space science is going to
be hurt," Friedman says.<P>

Research planned for the space station itself has already suffered from the
budget squeeze. In order to release $500 million for station development, NASA
last September decided to delay by two years launching eight closet-size racks of
the station's scientific equipment. The agency is also trying to gain some
financial maneuvering room by negotiating a barter with Japan. That country would
supply the station's centrifuge and a life-science research unit in exchange for
shuttle launches. The deal could push some of the station's development costs
into the future.<P>

Even creative accounting, however, cannot solve the problem of the Russian
government's failure to provide funds for the service module, a key early
component of the space station now languishing in Moscow. The holdup means that
permanent habitation of the station will have to be delayed by up to eight months
from the previous target of May 1998. The postponement creates a major political
problem, because delays, even more than cost overruns, corrode congressional
support. Andrew M. Allen, director for space station services at NASA
headquarters, says Russia promised in December 70 percent of the amount needed
for work on the module in 1997. But that still leaves a question mark over the
other 30 percent, not to mention work in 1998 and follow-on components.<P>

NASA is therefore evaluating contingency plans in case the U.S. decides that the
current agreement with Russia has to be recast. A year ago officials indicated
that building a substitute service module would cost in the region of $500
million. Allen believes NASA may be able to pare down that figure and stay within
its budget limit for the orbiting outpost. But the station would inevitably
suffer delays.<P>

The crunch facing NASA has gained high-level recognition. At a meeting billed as
a "space summit," to take place  this month, congressional leaders will meet with
President Bill Clinton to thrash out a long-term space strategy. Scientists are
being heard. Canizares and a star-studded team of investigators, including
Stephen Jay Gould of Harvard University and Stuart A. Kauffman of the Santa Fe
Institute, briefed Vice President Al Gore late last year on the new evidence of
life's ubiquity on Earth and its possible existence elsewhere. After the meeting,
Gore pledged that NASA "will continue to pursue a robust space science program
that will give us greater knowledge about our planet and our neighbors."<P>

Space scientists cannot afford to relax yet. One important player in the debate
over NASA will be Representative F. James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin, a
Republican who will chair the House Committee on Science this year. Sensenbrenner
is a strong supporter of the space station. He has, moreover, in previous years
expressed dismay about the program's dependence on Russian hardware. Unless
Russia proves in the next few months that it can be relied on to provide its
share of the station near budget and near schedule, Congress may direct NASA to
come up with a homemade fix. The resulting budgetary tumult would be unlikely to
benefit either human or robotic space exploration.<P>

PALEONTOLOGY

<center><H2>WHICH CAME FIRST?</H2>

<B>Feathered fossils fan debate <BR>over the bird-dinosaur link</B>
</center>

<P>The descent of birds from dinosaurs has been enshrined in venues as diverse as
the American Museum of Natural History and the blockbuster Jurassic Park. So
readers of the November 15 issue of <A HREF="http://science-mag.aaas.org/science/scripts/display/short/274/5290/1164.html"><I>Science</I></A> may well have been startled to
find a challenge to the notion that budgies are the great-great-great- (and so
on) grandchildren of <I>Tyrannosaurus rex. </I><P>

The article describes fossils from northern China of birds living as much as 140
million years ago. According to the authors, these birds were too highly
developed to have descended from dinosaurs; their ancestors may have been
reptilelike creatures that antedated dinosaurs. The mainstream press wasted no
time seizing on the heresy. "EARLY BIRD MARS DINOSAUR THEORY," proclaimed a
headline in the <I>New York Times. </I><P>

The <I>Science</I> report was written by Alan Feduccia of the University of North
Carolina and three colleagues. Feduccia is perhaps the most prominent critic of
the dinosaur-bird scenario. In <I>The Origin and Evolution of Birds, </I>
published last fall by Yale University Press, he attempts to refute the theory,
which is based primarily on similarities between the bones of birds and
dinosaurs.<P>

Feduccia argues that many of these shared features stem from convergent
evolution--coincidences, really--rather than common ancestry. He points out that
most of the fossil evidence for dinosaurs with birdlike features comes from the
Upper Cretaceous epoch, less than 100 million years ago. But birds were well
established much earlier than that, according to Feduccia.<P>

As evidence, Feduccia points to the fossils described in his recent
<I>Science</I>paper, which he says demonstrate that surprisingly modern birds
were thriving as early as 140 million years ago. The birds include the
magpie-size <I>Confuciusornis</I> and the sparrow-size <I>Liaoningornis, </I>both
of which had beaks rather than teeth. The latter creature was especially
modern-looking, possessing a "keeled" breastbone similar to those found in birds
today.<P>

Both birds were more advanced than <I>Archaeopteryx, </I> which has generally
been recognized as the first feathered bird (although it may have been a glider
rather than a true flier) and lived about 145 million years ago.
<I>Archaeopteryx</I> was not the ancestor of modern birds, as some theorists have
suggested, but was an evolutionary dead end, Feduccia asserts. The true ancestors
of birds, he speculates, were the archosaurs, lizardlike creatures that predated
dinosaurs and gave rise to <I>Archaeopteryx</I> as well as <I>Confuciusornis</I>
and <I>Liaoningornis. </I><P>

Two paleontologists who vehemently reject this scenario are Mark A. Norell and
Luis M. Chiappe of the American Museum of Natural History; they wrote a scathing
review of Feduccia's new book for the November 21 issue of <A HREF="http://www.nature.com/"><I>Nature.</I></A>
Feduccia and his colleagues "don't have one shred of evidence," Norell contends.
The fossil bed in which Feduccia's team found its specimens, he remarks, has been
dated by other researchers at 125 million years, leaving plenty of time for the
birds to have evolved from <I>Archaeopteryx</I> or some other dinosaurlike
ancestor.<P>

Chiappe notes that the anatomical evidence linking birds and dinosaurs is
accepted by the vast majority of paleontologists. He does not dispute Feduccia's
contention that many of the dinosaurs identified as having birdlike features
occurred in the Upper Cretaceous, well after birds were already established. But
that fact, Chiappe explains, in no way undermines the notion that birds descended
from dinosaurs--any more than the persistence of primates into the present means
that they could not have given rise to humans. Moreover, he adds, dinosaur
fossils from earlier periods are simply less common.<P>

Ironically, just two weeks before the paper by Feduccia and his co-workers
appeared, <I>Science</I> published a short news story on a fossil from the same
site in northern China--and thus the same epoch--as the birds described by
Feduccia's group. But this fossil <I>bolsters</I> the bird-dinosaur link--at
least according to Philip J. Currie of the Royal Tyrrell Museum in Alberta,
Canada, who has analyzed it.<P>

The fossil shows a turkey-size, bipedal dinosaur with what appear to be "downy
feathers" running down its back. The finding lends support to the notion that
feathers originated as a means of insulation for earthbound dinosaurs and only
later were adapted for flight. Currie and several Chinese scientists have written
a paper on the fossil that should be published early this year.<P>

"They don't look like feathers to me," declares Larry D. Martin, who has viewed
photographs of the dinosaur and was one of Feduccia's co-authors on the
<I>Science</I> paper. Currie retorts that Martin and Feduccia are so opposed to
the standard view of birds' origins that they will reject any evidence. But for
most paleontologists, he says, "the evidence is overwhelming that dinosaurs did
give rise to birds."

FIELD NOTES

<center><h2>Agent Angst</h2></center><P>

The audience of academics and journalists gathered at the Brookings Institution
had every reason to be excited: the venerable liberal-leaning think tank was
announcing the publication of a new book with, in the words of Robert E. Litan,
director of economic studies, "revolutionary" implications. It was, Litan
declared, the "most innovative, potentially pathbreaking" book ever to bear the
Brookings name. The work, <A HREF="http://leia.brook.edu/sugarscape/"> <I>Growing Artificial Societies,</I></A> by Joshua M.
Epstein and Robert Axtell, describes the two scholars' investigations of their
computer-based world called Sugarscape. After the lights went down in the
auditorium, Epstein and Axtell provided commentary while a giant display showed
how "agents"--simpleminded red and blue blobs representing people--scurry around
a grid, competing for yellow resources whimsically named "sugar" and "spice." The
agents--more elaborate versions of the dots in John H. Conway's game called
Life--eat, mate, trade and fight according to rules set down by their human
"gods."<P>

The agents' antics invite anthropomorphism. (Epstein referred to one as
practicing "subsistence farming" far from the sugar "mountain.") The model's
purpose, he explained, is, by employing "radical simplification,"  to study
interacting factors that affect real societies. When agents are let loose in
Sugarscape, trends emerge that would be hard to predict. A population may
oscillate in size, and often a few individuals garner much of the "wealth," a
well-known phenomenon in human societies. The researchers hope to discover which
rules, such as inheritance laws, generate which effects. The pair is now using a
similar approach to model the population decline of the Anasazi of the American
Southwest.<P>

A reporter (this one, truth to tell) asked how the Brookings scholars would know
that the critical rules identified in Sugarscape are actually important in the
real world. "You don't," Epstein admitted, because many different real-life rules
could produce the same outcome. That is a problem with all science, he said,
noting that Sugarscape nonetheless provided an improvement on existing economic
theory ("mainly just a lot of talk"). But Thomas C. Schelling of the University
of Maryland, an early pioneer of agent-based modeling, reinforced <I>Scientific
American's</I>lingering doubt: "You still want to ask, If there are many
different ways of producing [a] phenomenon, how do we know we have captured
what's really there?" Schelling observed.<P>

Another reporter rained on Brookings's parade by asking whether Sugarscape has
implications for, say, tax policy. That prompted a reminder that the model is
still in early development and that Sugarscape would first have to model
governments. Epstein earned notoriety in 1991, when he used other computer
simulations to calculate that between 600 and 3,750 U.S. soldiers would die in
the Gulf War. In fact, only 244 died. But his confidence is apparently undented.
On a roll, he started speculating at the Sugarscape book launch that agents could
shed light on whether free markets will survive in Russia. John D. Steinbruner, a
senior foreign policy fellow at Brookings, interjected that no computer model is
ready to answer that question. Soon after, he wound down the discussion, noting
that although "well short of a complete account," Sugarscape offers tools "that
do appear to be very useful in the process of conceptualization."

MARINE BIOLOGY

<center><H2>SOAKING UP THE RAYS</H2>

<B>A sponge uses optical fibers<BR>to gather sunlight</B>
</center>

<P>It is hard to see under the sea-particularly if you are 120 meters down, lying
beneath a thick covering of ice during the endless nights of the Antarctic
winter. Yet even in this deep night, hoards of tiny algae live inside sponges,
soaking up carbon dioxide and, in turn, producing nutrients for their hosts. The
mystery has been where these minute green plants get the light they need to drive
photosynthesis.<P>

Taking inspiration from the age of telecommunications, Italian scientists
recently discovered the secret of the symbionts. It turns out that some sponges
have a system of fiber optics that allows them to gather what little light
reaches their murky depths and to direct it to the algae. "We don't give sponges
much credit. Most people look at them and say 'this is a blobby lump,'" comments
Mary K. Harper of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. "But considering how
primitive these animals are, it's amazing how adaptable they are."<P>

Like many sponges, the Antarctic sponge that the team from the universities of
Genoa and Perugia examined, <I>Rossella racovitzae</I>, has a skeleton composed
of little silica spikes called spicules. They support the creature and keep
predators away. In the case of <I>R. racovitzae</I>, however, each spicule is
capped with a cross-shaped antenna of sorts. The flat spokes of the antenna
capture light, which then travels directly down the silica tube of the spicule to
the garden of green thriving at the base. (Harper suspects that this mechanism
might allow larger numbers of algae to thrive because there is more surface area
in the internal folds of the sponge than on its outer surface.)<P>

The researchers discovered <I>R. racovitzae's</I> system after firing red laser
light down a straight, 10-centimeter-long spicule and observing its unimpeded
travel. They then bent the spicule at various angles to see if it still
successfully guided the red light--and it did. Although they have tested just the
one sponge--largely because its spicules are long and easy to work with--the
scientists think others may use the same device. Group leader Riccardo
Cattaneo-Vietti says they will soon begin looking at cave-dwelling sponges for
the same adaptation.<P>

Sponges are not the only owners of a natural light-guidance system. According to
Jay M. Enoch of the University of California at Berkeley, some copepods--another
form of marine organism--have light guides. And certain tropical plants have
dome-shaped lenses on their leaves, allowing them to collect and focus any light
filtering down through the thick rain-forest canopy. As Thomas Vogelmann of the
University of Wyoming described a few years ago, these leaf lenses lead to cells
inside the plant, which, in turn, guide light to needy cells at the
base.

ASTRONOMY

<center><H2>GALACTIC GUSHERS</h2>

<B>Evidence mounts that black holes<BR> 
drive all quasars</B></center><P>

Shining with the energy of a trillion suns, quasars are the brightest as well as
some of the most distant objects in the known universe. Astronomers have devised
theories to explain what drives such infernos, but because they are so far away,
gathering the evidence has been a challenge. The drought of data is coming to an
end, however. Recent surveys conducted with the <A HREF="http://www.stsci.edu/pubinfo/PR/96/35.html">Hubble Space Telescope</A> have
answered some key questions about quasars, although the surveys have also
highlighted some gaps in the standard account. Meanwhile a study that combined
the observing power of radio telescopes in different countries has found separate
evidence that all quasars operate in fundamentally the same way.<P>

Despite their prodigious luminosity, quasars are not large; they may be even
smaller than the solar system. The dominant view is that only a supermassive
black hole-a body so dense that not even light escapes it--can generate so much
energy in such a small space. Physicists calculate that if something propelled a
gas cloud into the vicinity of a black hole, the gas could fuel a quasar. The
black hole's gravity would accelerate the gas to near the speed of light, turning
it into plasma. Before being consumed, the fuel would be swept into a maelstrom
called an accretion disk, where friction would efficiently generate light and
other radiation.<P>

SIZE=2><B>QUASARS IMAGED BY HUBBLE</B> occur in undisturbed galaxies (left) and in
galaxies in the process of colliding (right).</FONT></center></td>
</tr></table><P>

The new pictures by Hubble bolster that theory. The telescope has provided the
first clear view of the immediate environments of a range of quasars. The images
show that most, if not all, lie in the cores of luminous galaxies, including both
the common spiral and elliptical types. That suggests the gas cloud theory is on
the mark, because galaxies are where gas clouds are found. Moreover, some of the
galaxies playing host to a quasar seem to have collided recently with another
galaxy. These accident victims display features not found in more quiescent
galaxies: parts of some of them seem to have been torn off or distorted. That
supports the gas cloud theory, too, because the forces generated in such a
collision could easily throw clouds into the feeding zone of a hungry black
hole.<P>

Harder to understand is why most of the quasars reside in apparently undisturbed
galaxies. "This result is in some ways the most unexpected one that we have
obtained," notes John N. Bahcall of the Institute for Advanced Study in
Princeton, N.J. Astronomers had tentatively figured that unless a collision
delivers large amounts of gas to a black hole, galaxies harboring these cosmic
carnivores would supply fuel too slowly to sustain a full-blown quasar. Rather,
the theory went, they might sputter just enough to become the lesser lights known
as Seyfert galaxies. Michael J. Disney of University College in Cardiff, Wales,
adds: "We're puzzling over the ones that aren't interacting."<P>

Bahcall suspects that some subtle mechanism that Hubble cannot resolve must be
supplying the fuel for these quasars. Planned studies of even more distant
quasars might provide a better idea of how they and their host galaxies evolve
over time, notes Donald Schneider of Pennsylvania State University.<P>

Despite the diversity of galaxies that harbor quasars, radio-wavelength
observations suggest that most quasars share key features in common. "Radio-loud"
quasars-the 10 percent of them that emit strongly at radio wavelengths-have
previously been observed to have jets of plasma emerging from their "poles" at
speeds near that of light. An accretion disk around a black hole is the only
imaginable source for plasma jets, but because astronomers have not until now
seen such jets emanating from "radio-weak" quasars, some researchers have
suspected that these objects, making up the majority of quasars, work
differently. Now radio astronomers at the University of Maryland and the Max
Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy in Bonn have found evidence for jets of
plasma emerging at almost the speed of light from radio-weak quasars.<P>

The quasars that were studied had previously been classified as members of a
small group of "radio-intermediate" quasars, but the new observations indicate
that their unusual characteristics arise because their plasma jets happen to
point directly toward our galaxy. The new radio-telescope observations, by
showing that radio-weak quasars share the key feature of jets with radio-loud
quasars, thus indicate that "probably all quasars harbor a very similar engine,"
according to Heino Falcke of the University of Maryland. The same basic
mechanism, he believes, also drives Seyfert galaxies. But many questions remain.
If radio-weak and radio-loud quasars indeed share the same mechanism, the
explanation for their differences is now "an even deeper mystery," he says. <P>

ANTI GRAVITY

<center><h2>Dropping One for Science</h2></center>

<P>Okay, let's cut right to the chase. The reason the guy gets into the moose suit
is because he couldn't throw the dung far enough.<P>

Well, maybe we should back up. For the past two decades, conservation biologist
<A HREF="http://loco.biology.unr.edu/eecb/faculty/berger.html">Joel Berger</A> of the University of Nevada at Reno has studied the behavioral,
ecological and reproductive biology of mammals. For the past two years, he has
focused on the relationship between predator and prey in the greater Yellowstone
National Park area and in south-central Alaska. "Our research is concerned with
what happens to prey in systems where large carnivores are absent," he told a
group of reporters last November at New York City's Central Park Zoo, part of the
Wildlife Conservation Society, which funds his current research. "This is
important, because in most of the world, systems are going to be losing large
carnivores, rather than gaining them."<P>

Both study sites contain a favorite food of grizzly bears and wolves, namely,
moose. (See, we're getting there.) Grizzlies and wolves, however, are much more
common in Alaska than around Yellowstone. This discrepancy has some easily
quantifiable effects. A century ago moose were rare around Jackson Hole, in the
Yellowstone area; they thrive now. More than 90 percent of moose calves survive
every year at Jackson Hole, whereas only about 35 percent do in Alaska. From the
moose perspective in Yellowstone, times are good.<P>

One thing Berger wants to know, therefore, is how deeply those good times affect
behavior: Might prey animals begin to forget sensory cues warning of danger? So
he and his colleagues played recordings of predator calls to moose at the
different sites. "In Wyoming, moose failed to respond to wolf calls," Berger
says. "In Alaska, they are sensitive and reduce the time they spend feeding by
about half." Another cue should be odor. To test moose reaction to smell, Berger
uses two potent sources of predator scent: urine and dung.<P>

Getting the dung is one thing, the basic strategy being to wander around and pick
up grizzly and wolf scat. Depositing it close enough to the moose to observe
systematically their reactions to the smell is a messier issue. You cannot simply
walk up to a moose. They're big, they're dangerous, they're scared-think of the
New York Jets. Apparently, Berger did. "I had played some ball in college," the
44-year-old Berger says, "and could still throw reasonably accurately." Those
throws weren't far enough, however. "We tried slingshots," he continues, "but
they don't work so well. You can only get a small amount through. We tried longer
and longer slingshots, but then you get sound effects." And hurling urine
remained a problem as well.<P>

Declining the opportunity to experiment with catapults or, for that matter,
moosapults or scatapults, Berger was left with an old strategy: if you can't beat
'em, join 'em. A designer from the Star Wars movies created the moose suit, which
looks like something two people would get into for a Halloween party, but which
looks like a moose to other moose, who don't see all that well. The idea is to
stroll up to a real moose, drop off some scat, avoid getting mounted and saunter
away. Preliminary tests of the suit showed that moose seemed unperturbed. Bison,
though, "ran like hell," according to Berger, which may mean that they see better
or simply don't like moose.<P>

If everything has gone well, Berger and his wife and colleague, Carol Cunningham,
will have spent much of this winter in the suit. (At the same time-she's in
back.) Before leaving the zoo to return west, Berger was asked if he had any
concerns about safety. He answered simply, "Lots."

<A HREF="http://www.lungusa.org/noframes/learn/lung/lunpneumoni.html">Pneumonia,</A> an acute inflammation of the lungs, is not a single disease but more
like a family of several dozen diseases, each caused by a different agent. The
agents include a variety of bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites and chemicals and
produce different symptoms, but typically patients have fever, difficulty
breathing, chest pain and coughing, including the coughing up of blood. The
symptoms last a week or more, and in its classic form, lobar pneumonia, 30
percent of patients die if not treated.<P>

Transmission is usually by inhalation but also by hand-to-mouth contact. Patients
in hospitals, which abound with pathogens, are vulnerable, especially through
invasive devices such as catheters and respirators. The immune system, the
mechanical action of coughing and the microscopic motion of cilia normally
protect healthy individuals. But old people, who generally have weaker defense
mechanisms than the young, are far more likely to die of pneumonia. Those whose
defenses are compromised by, say, AIDS or cancer, are also at high risk, as are
those given certain medicines such as immunosuppressive drugs. Men are at higher
risk than women, partly because they are more prone to alcoholism and nicotine
addiction, two of the many risk factors for pneumonia. Blacks are at higher risk
than whites, perhaps because they often lack access to good medical care. Air
pollution also plays a role.<P>

In recent years, pneumonia was the underlying cause of death for about 80,000
Americans annually, whereas for an additional 100,000 or so, it was a
contributing cause of death. The map shows only those deaths for which pneumonia
is registered as the underlying cause. There is an ancient theory, suggested by
the higher mortality rates documented in winter, that cold temperatures promote
pneumonia, but this idea is not consistent with the pattern on the map:
Massachusetts has a high rate, but so does Georgia, and North Dakota has the
third lowest rate. Florida is lowest, which may reflect the "healthy retiree"
effect; that is, the tendency of healthy older people to retire to places like
Florida while their less healthy compatriots remain home. California has the
highest rate, perhaps in part because of air pollution levels in southern
California.<P>

Pneumonia probably affected prehistoric humans and is one of the oldest diagnosed
diseases, having been described by the Hippocratic physicians of ancient Greece.
In 1900 it was the second deadliest killer in the U.S. after tuberculosis. The
extraordinarily high rate in 1918 resulted from the great influenza pandemic that
year, which killed more than 540,000 Americans. Since then, pneumonia mortality
rates have decreased markedly because of better hygiene and increasingly
effective methods of treatment: first, antipneumococcal serum, then sulfa drugs,
and finally, in the 1940s, penicillin. The increase in deaths during the past 15
years stems primarily from the growing number of old people.

IN BRIEF

<P><B>Evolutionary Makeovers</B>

<P>Many insects, fish, birds and reptiles adapt their looks to new
surroundings and seasons: when the African butterfly Bicyclus anynana is
born during the rainy season, for example, it sports eye spots to scare
off predators, but generations born during drier times do not. How
different are these animals? Scientists from the University of Wisconsin
at Madison, the University of Leiden and the University of Edinburgh have
discovered that it takes the presence of very few genes--half a dozen or
so--to vary an animal's appearance radically. The find helps to explain
the astounding array of biological diversity.

<P><HR><B>Elephant Man's Real Disease</B>

<P>Joseph Cary Merrick, the famous Victorian known as the Elephant Man,
probably did not have neurofibromatosis, the condition most commonly
referred to as Elephant Man's disease. Radiologists at Royal London
Hospital, where Merrick lived and his bones remain, have now substantiated
the theory that, instead, he suffered from a rarer disorder called proteus
syndrome. Recent radiograph and CT scans of Merrick's skull revealed
characteristics of the noninherited disease, caused by malfunctions in
cell growth.

<P><HR><B>Holey Microchips</B>

<P>Porous silicon was all the rage when in 1990 it was discovered to emit
light. But dreams of incorporating it into microchips were dashed by its
fragility, because the material could not withstand the ordinary rigors of
chip manufacture. In last November's <I>Nature,</I> researchers at the
University of Rochester and the Rochester Institute of Technology report
that they managed to fortify porous silicon with a double layer of silicon
oxide. The team then combined this so-called silicon-rich silicon oxide
with a conventional microchip, making for the first time an all-silicon
system that in principle can process both light and electricity.


<P><HR><B>Scanning for Trouble</B>

<P>Diagnosing appendicitis has always been dicey: one in five patients
undergoes costly surgery without cause; another 20 percent go home only to
get sicker. But a new CT x-ray technique, unveiled at a December meeting
of the Radiological Society of North America, should change that. The
focused appendix CT, or FACT scan, capitalizes on dye in the colon to view
the appendix--infected or not--more clearly. And because FACT scans home
in on the abdomen's lower right quadrant only, they cost half as much as
full abdominal scans.


<P><HR><B>Twirly Birds</B>

<P>This high-speed photograph, taken by biologist Bates Littlehales of the
University of California at Los Angeles, reveals why phalaropes spin on
the water's surface: when the wading birds chase their tails, they churn
up prey. Littlehales and his colleagues caught the kinetic feeding on film
by placing the small shorebirds in a tank containing dye-stained brine.
When the birds performed their pirouettes, a tornado of fluorescent food
funneled up below them.


<P><HR><B>Protection with Estrogen</B>

<P>Neuroscientists have uncovered sundry ways in which estrogen protects
women from brain damage. Patricia Hurn and her colleagues at Johns Hopkins
University found that compared with male rats, natural estrogen levels
leave females three times less vulnerable to brain damage from stroke. And
Sanjay Asthana of the Veterans Medical Center in Tacoma, Wash., has
demonstrated the hormone's redemptive potential in Alzheimer's patients:
in a small study of elderly women with moderate dementia, estrogen patches
temporarily improved both their attention and memory.


<P><HR><B>Genetic Junkyards</B>

<P>Last year scientists charting the human genome put many key landmarks on the map.
Now they have filled in street addresses for 16,354 genes-many of unknown
function. Of greater interest, some of the new genetic neighborhoods are heavily
populated, whereas others are deserted. One theory posits that barren stretches
in the genome may be junkyards for discarded DNA scraps. The map is available at
<A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SCIENCE96/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SCIENCE96/</A>.


<P><HR><B>Antimatter in the Making</B>

<P>Confirming earlier results from CERN, physicists at Fermilab found seven
antihydrogen atoms last November. To make the antiatoms--which contain an
antiproton and a positron each--the team sent an antiproton beam through a
gas jet, thereby pairing electrons and positrons and, in rarer instances,
positrons and antiprotons. Semiconductors Get Bent Eager to show that
crystal semiconductors could be made flexible, researchers at the State
University of New York at Buffalo deposited thin layers of semiconducting
materials onto weather-stripping silicone. The resulting semiconductor,
when peeled from the silicone, retained most of its properties. According
to head researcher Hong Luo, the semiconductor was tougher than those
crafted from bendable polymers and possessed better optical properties.
They might prove useful in optical circuits and in solar cells.

<P><HR><B>Rivals of the Fittest</B>

<P>It may not be how far you run but how fast that counts. In a recent
study of more than 8,000 athletes, researchers at Lawrence Berkeley
National Laboratory found that the fleetest of foot had the healthiest of
hearts: slower, regular runners had more high-density lipoproteins ("good"
cholesterol) than sprinters, but they also had higher blood pressure.


<P><HR><B>FOLLOW-UP</B>

<P><B>Prostate Cancer Gene Identified.</B>Collaborators from Johns Hopkins University, the National Center for Human
Genome Research and Ume University in Sweden have found a stretch of
chromosome 1 that can predispose men to prostate cancer. Indeed, mutations
in a gene in this region, named HPC1 for hereditary prostate cancer 1,
probably account for some 30 to 40 percent of all inherited forms of the
disease. Some 5 to 10 percent of all prostate cancers are genetic. (See
September 1996, <A HREF="http://www.sciam.com/0996issue/0996scardino.html">Does Screening for Prostate Cancer

<P><B>Losing on Fusion.</B> A new take on how turbulence affects hot ionized gas trapped in a tokamak
may dash all hopes for the first controlled, self-sustaining fusion burn.
For a decade, scientists behind the International Thermonuclear
Experimental Reactor (ITER)--a $10-billion multinational project--have
argued that ITER would demonstrate fusion's practicality by 2010. But the
new theory, put forth by two physicists at the University of Texas at
Austin, suggests technical problems will make the wait much longer. (See
April 1992, The International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor.)

AVIATION

<center><H2>IT'S A HELICOPTER!<BR> IT'S A PLANE!</H2>

<B>A nonmilitary tilt-rotor<BR> is conceived, but will it fly?</B>
</center>

<P>When Bell Helicopter Textron and Boeing Company announced last November that
they would build a revolutionary new tilt-rotor aircraft, the superlatives flew,
even though no aircraft would for at least five years. Bell chairman Webb Joiner
suggested that construction of the tilt-rotor, a hybrid of helicopter and
airplane, would be as important as "the very beginning of manned flight
itself."<P>

Certainly, the more crowded big-city airports become, the more attractive
tilt-rotors seem. In theory, at least, they combine the best features of
helicopters and fixed-wing airplanes. They can take off and land vertically, in a
compact area the size of a helipad. After taking off, the engine-propeller
assembly rotates 90 degrees, turning the craft into something like a conventional
turboprop airplane, able to fly with approximately the turboprop's speed and
range. Aviation officials say such a craft would not need airports to shuttle
people between large cities separated by a few hundred miles; it would take off
and land in more convenient locations closer to-or even within-metropolitan
areas.<P>

With an advantage like that, why aren't the skies full of tilt-rotors? Because
uniting the two great classes of aircraft into a single hybrid has proved to be a
major challenge, one that engineers have been working on for more than 40 years.
Designed to carry six to nine passengers, the proposed Bell Boeing 609 will
actually be an updated version of the experimental, 1970s-era XV-15, which was a
test-bed for a military tilt-rotor known as the <A HREF="http://www.bellhelicopter.textron.com/cn/tr/v22.html">V-22 Osprey.</A> The V-22's
development program, which one secretary of defense struggled to terminate, was
marred by two crashes, one of which killed seven people. The Osprey, which holds
24 marines and their gear, is expected to go into service in 1999, after 18 years
of design and development. <P>

Tilt-rotors are a study in trade-offs. They must have rotors large enough to lift
the craft vertically but small enough for reasonably efficient cruising in
airplane mode. "It's intuitively obvious that you have to give away something,"
notes David S. Jenney, editor of the <I>Journal of the American Helicopter Society</I>
and a retired helicopter engineer. According to Bell, the V-22 has a lift-to-drag
ratio of eight, meaning that eight times as much thrust is required to lift the
vehicle vertically as to move it forward. This ratio is important because it
determines the extremes of thrust for which the tilting rotors must be efficient.
When it is cruising, the aircraft is essentially overcoming drag-which is,
according to the ratio, eight times less than the weight. <P>

Another requirement is an airframe that can withstand the distinct vibrations and
stresses of both vertical and horizontal flight. This hurdle was for the most
part insurmountable until the development in the 1970s of advanced carbon-fiber
composite materials.<P>

With a projected maximum cruising speed of 509 kilometers per hour and a maximum
range of 1,400 kilometers, the 609 will go "twice as fast and twice as far" as a
helicopter, Bell officials claim. Not all experts share that view, however. "The
tilt-rotor should be more efficient and burn less fuel per mile than a
helicopter," Jenney says. "But the two-to-one claim is probably exaggerated."<P>

The greatest difficulties for the 609 will not be technical, though. "I don't
doubt they can make it work," Jenney adds. "The challenge will be financial
viability." A 1987 study estimated that maintenance of a civilian V-22 would cost
about $835 for each hour spent in flight; for a comparable turboprop the cost was
$180 an hour. Nevertheless, Bell spokesman Terry Arnold asserts that "we think
[maintenance costs] will be comparable to turboprops and small jets, and much
lower than for helicopters." The 609 is expected to cost about $10 million when
it is delivered, probably around 2002. A helicopter with similar lift capability
would cost in the neighborhood of $7 million.<P>

With its limited cargo capacity, the 609 will be targeted to several niche
markets now served mainly by helicopters. The uses include shuttling executives
among scattered corporate sites, transporting crews and equipment to offshore oil
rigs, search and rescue, disaster relief and medical evacuation, and various
border-patrol activities. <P>

Commercial shuttle service between cities would await larger tilt-rotors
(preliminary designs have already been sketched for 19-, 31-, 39- and
75-passenger craft) and new federal regulations governing the certification and
operation of tilt-rotors in heavily populated areas. Such regulations, now being
formulated by the Federal Aviation Administration, may determine as much as
anything else whether the tilt-rotor concept finally flies or becomes yet another
intriguing idea that never quite got off the ground.

MATERIALS SCIENCE

<center><H2>NATURAL SYNTHETICS</H2>

<B>Genetically engineered plants produce<BR> cotton/polyester blends and nonallergenic rubber<P>
</B>
</center>

<P>Farmers have long bred crop strains to resist cold, pests and disease. More
recently, biotechnologists have tinkered with plants' genes as a more efficient
means to the same ends. Now two experiments have demonstrated that breeders and
genetic engineers can do more with plants than just boost their yield: they can
actually grow entirely new materials-including some, like plastics, heretofore
considered synthetic. If the techniques prove commercially viable, they could
produce warmer clothing and safer medical supplies from all-natural sources.<P>

In November, scientists at Agracetus in Middleton, Wis., reported creating
transgenic cotton plants that fill the hollow middle of their fibers with a small
amount of the plastic polyester, polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB). The team built on
earlier work first published in 1992 by Chris Somerville of the Carnegie
Institution, who hoped to engineer plants that produced so much PHB that farmers
could harvest plastics as cheaply as refineries manufacture them. Although
Somerville's plants never grew enough PHB to be commercially viable, the research
grabbed the attention of Agracetus.<P>

There Maliyakal E. John and Greg Keller used a gene gun to shoot gold beads
coated with genes for PHB production into a cotton seedling. As the plant grew,
they pruned any leaves and buds that did not express the genes until at last they
had a mature plant whose entire length held at least one layer of genetically
transformed tissue. Although the process is hardly efficient-John and Keller had
to shoot 14,000 seedlings to obtain 30 mutant plants-it has two advantages over
test-tube techniques. The gene gun works with whole plants (commercial cotton
does not grow well from tissue culture), and it can insert several genes at
once.<P>

Don't expect wrinkle-free, 50/50-blend shirts coming out of cotton fields just
yet. So far even the best bolls are still mostly cellulose and less than 1
percent PHB by weight. Not much, but enough to make a difference: Agracetus
claims that cotton fabric woven from these polyester hybrids retains 8.6 percent
more heat than unaltered fabric. John concedes that commercial applications will
probably require boosting PHB levels by three times or more, which may take
years.<P>

In the meantime, the company plans to stick other useful polymers inside cotton
fibers. More complex forms of PHB, polymers from other plants, and even keratin
(the protein that makes up hair), Keller says, could help mutant cotton hold
heat, retain colors and wick away moisture better than the wild type.<P>

Genetic engineering may not be necessary to grow improved materials, however.
Consider the case of an unassuming Chihuahuan desert shrub called guayule
(pronounced gwah-YOO-lee). The plant naturally produces latex-although not nearly
as profusely as the tropical trees from which all rubber products currently ow.
But 15 years of classical breeding has tripled its rubber output to about 900
pounds per acre-comparable to tropical trees, says breeder Dennis Ray of the
University of Arizona.<P>

Guayule rubber is as durable and strong as tropical rubber, and it has two
advantages. It grows in such arid regions as Arizona, where tropical trees
cannot. More important, guayule rubber is nonallergenic. This property, says
Katrina Cornish of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, is what gives guayule its
niche. There are 57 allergenic proteins in tropical rubber. As a result, latex
allergy, with symptoms ranging from simple skin irritation to anaphylactic shock,
is common among health care workers and others who frequently come in contact
with rubber. Unfortunately, synthetic alternatives such as nylon tend to allow
uids and viruses to leak through.<P>

Guayule rubber should perform better. In a 1994 study of 21 latex-sensitive
patients, none responded to guayule proteins. Even so, Cornish is modifying the
guayule latex extraction process to keep protein concentrations low. Meanwhile
Ulex Corporation in Philadelphia is negotiating with the USDA to license
Cornish's process. If all goes well, the next few years should see the blooming
of fields full of manufacturing plants.<P>

COMPUTING

<center><H2>MAKING SENSE</H2>

<B>Microsoft uses a dictionary<BR>to teach computers English</B><P>
</center>

<P>In a lab at Microsoft Research in Redmond, Wash., <A HREF="http://www.research.microsoft.com/research/srg/xueh/default.htm">Xuedong Huang</A> sits me down
at his computer to show off the company's new speech-recognition software. "It is
just a matter of time," he asserts, until people operate computers using their
mouths more than their hands.<P>

Time, Huang's demonstration reveals, is precisely the issue. To his attentive
dictation program, I enunciate: "Microsoft Corporation is working on advanced
speech-recognition systems." The program obediently spells out my sentence but
substitutes "Petras" for "advanced." I highlight the mistake and say "advanced"
again; the computer writes "bitterness." Another try, and the program suggests
"pariahs." Finally, Huang types the correct word. The entire exercise takes about
30 seconds--twice the time required to simply type the sentence.<P>

Such frustrating behavior is hardly peculiar to Microsoft's software. Oblivious
to grammar and context, even the best speech-recognition systems stumble over
homonyms ("write their weight" or "right there, wait?"). To do more than just
dictation--to actually follow spoken orders--such systems still make users
memorize long lists of permissible commands. "Send message" may work, but "e-mail
this letter" may not.<P>

They do this to avoid dealing with ambiguity. Told to "scan this text for typos,"
should the machine search for the word "typo"? Common sense says of course not.
But how, short of typing in millions of facts can one endow computers with a
modicum of common sense?<P>

Down the hall from Huang, a team of computational linguists led by Karen Jensen
believes it is onto an answer. "Our system pulls itself up by its bootstraps,
using natural language to understand natural language," Jensen says.<P>

The process works in four stages. Starting with a database of all English root
words labeled with their simplest attributes--singular or plural, noun or verb,
and so on--the researchers first coded the rules for adding prefixes and
suffixes. Next they wrote a parser that can diagram the words in a sentence
according to function. In the third stage, a program used the words, rules and
parser to page through an unabridged dictionary, creating a new database entry
for each meaning of each word. "A," for example, has three senses: as a noun, a
preposition and an indefinite article. The system links each sense with the
entries for all the significant words that appear in its definition. So entry one
for "a" is connected to "first," "letter," "English" and "alphabet." After 24
hours or so, the program at last reaches "zymurgy," having woven an enormous web
of words.<P>

The database is still riddled with ambiguity, however; "a" is linked to "letter,"
but "letter" has several meanings. Should "a" be linked to "a symbol or
character" or to "a written message?" The fourth stage resolves many such
questions using a second program guided by a copy of the web itself. Scanning the
several senses of "letter," the program finds that the first definition (a symbol
or character) contains the words "English" and "alphabet," which match the first
definition of "a," so it refines its link between the two words.<P>

The technique, says Martin S. Chodorow of the City University of New York
Graduate Center, can extract many semantic relationships from almost any
text--including those in other languages. (Microsoft is building similar systems
for French, German, Spanish, Chinese, Japanese and Korean.) Theoretically, Jensen
says, the system could use a bilingual dictionary to generate a web linking
English words with their semantic counterparts in another language--a big step
toward automatic translation. <P>

Microsoft is focusing, predictably, on more immediate applications. Its new word
processor uses simplified versions of the team's early work as a grammar checker.
The next step, Chodorow speculates, might be an intelligent thesaurus that spots
misused words and recommends alternatives. Jensen responds that the entire
information base still is too big and slow to go into a commercial product. But
history suggests that day may come sooner than expected.<P>

PATHOLOGY

<center><H2>BEATING BACTERIA</H2>

<B>New ways to fend off<BR>
antibiotic-resistant pathogens</B><P>
</center>

<P>Exotic diseases such as Ebola and hantavirus capture headlines, but the real
hot zone encompasses familiar infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, malaria,
cholera, diarrhea and pneumonia: more than 10 million people died from these
conditions in 1995. More disturbingly, the bacteria responsible for these
ailments are becoming ever more resistant to today's drugs. In response,
researchers have come up with novel ways to find antibiotics and are exploring
several possible treatments--even some that derive from the days before
antibiotics--that could defeat the resistant pathogens.<P>

Although physicians have known for some time that bacteria can develop resistance
to a particular antibiotic, until recently they were confident that another drug
in stock would work. The antibiotics arsenal is now close to empty. For example,
certain strains of enterococci bacteria no longer respond to vancomycin--the drug
of last resort that doctors thought could beat any bacterial infection. In its
<A HREF="http://www.who.org/whr/1996/whr-e.htm"><I>World Health Report 1996</I></A>, the World Health Organization stated that "too
few new drugs are being developed to replace those that have lost their
effectiveness. In the race for supremacy, microbes are sprinting ahead."<P>

Researchers are only beginning to catch up. Drug companies scaled back their
antibiotic development efforts after the 1950s, but a recent survey showed that
the number of medicines and vaccines in development for infectious disease is up
33 percent since 1994. Most of these drugs remain in preclinical development or
early clinical trials, however, and are not expected to reach the market for
several years.<P>

Many of the potential drugs have emerged from novel search methods. Vincent
Ahonkhai, vice president for anti-infective agents at SmithKline Beecham, notes
that because of the lack of rapid progress, "companies are loathe to continue in
the same old ways" to discover antibiotics, such as altering the chemical
structure of current drugs or screening microorganisms for potent antibiotics.
"There's a rush to explore other methods," he says. One such approach is
genomics, which involves sequencing the genetic code of disease-causing microbes
to determine new targets for drugs to attack (this technique has also been
instrumental in producing antiviral agents against HIV infection). Antibiotics
developed using a genomics approach are still in the early stages of research.<P>

Scientists are also turning to new natural sources. Daniel Bonner, executive
director of anti-infective microbiology at Bristol-Myers Squibb, suggests that
"there has been a change of thinking" in the search for naturally occurring
antibiotics. Historically, people relied on antibiotic compounds produced by
microorganisms (penicillin and erythromycin, for instance, are both produced by
bacteria). But now Bonner says companies are considering a panoply of living
creatures--plants, bees, grasshoppers and algae, to name a few. For example,
researchers discovered that shark stomachs contain a compound called squalamine,
which has antibiotic properties.<P>

Investigators occasionally find an entirely new class of antibiotics
serendipitously, usually by routine testing of thousands of synthetic chemicals.
Last November Merck Research Laboratories announced the discovery of a class of
novel antibiotics that in initial tests killed several strains of drug-resistant
bacteria.<P>

Still, it is not clear that an antibiotic can ever be immune to the problem of
evolving resistance. W. Michael Scheld of the University of Virginia School of
Medicine notes that previous generations of antibiotics at first appeared
invincible: "History tells us to be cautious," he advises. At best, new drugs
might remain potent for longer.<P>

In the face of this quandary, some scientists are turning to drugs other than
antibiotics. Jan van de Winkel of Utrecht University has been working with
Medarex on what he calls "bispecific antibodies": chimeric molecules with one
region that recognizes the microbial target and a second region that recognizes
phagocytic cells of the immune system--in effect, these molecules escort the
harmful pathogens to their enemies. According to van de Winkel, this approach "is
a more natural way to combat infectious disease" because it employs the body's
immune system. As a result, he believes, "the chances are probably much smaller
that resistance will develop."<P>

Even more unusual suggestions, harkening back to the days before antibiotics,
have been proposed. One such approach relies on bacteria-attacking viruses,
called bacteriophages. Another proposes irradiating a patient's blood with
ultraviolet radiation to kill microorganisms. Neither, however, has garnered
significant support among the medical community as a whole, which doubts the
efficacy of such procedures.<P>

While patients wait for new infection-fighting treatments, physicians emphasize
the proper administration of antibiotics. The Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention is currently putting together a campaign to warn about the risks of
improper or unnecessary use of antibiotics. The series of videos, pamphlets and
other educational material should come out within the next few months, just in
time for the spring cold season.

NANOTECHNOLOGY

<center><H2>Scoring with Buckyballs</H2><P>
</center>

<P>All the hauling, lugging and lifting to construct the ancient  pyramids one
block at a time was, no doubt, tedious work. But forming an object one molecule
at a time can be even more intricate. Now two groups exploring nanotechnology
have recently incorporated buckminsterfullerene and related structures into their
repertoire, thereby bringing buckyballs--those spherical molecules made of
carbon--a step closer to genuine applications.<P>

One group's work may improve an existing specialized tool of nanoengineering--the
scanning-force microscope (SFM), which relies on fine tips to detect and nudge
molecules. Until now, tips were rather large, up to 2,000 nanometers thick.
Hongjie Dai of Rice University, working with buckyball co-discoverer and Nobelist
<A HREF="http://pgsa.rice.edu/physics/faculty/Smalley.html">Richard E. Smalley,</A> fashioned some fullerenes into a pipe, or "nanotube," to
replace some SFM tips..<P>

Shaped like concentric cylinders of chicken wire, these multiwall tubes can range
between five and 20 nanometers thick, thus facilitating more accurate atomic
manipulation. When capped at one end with a hemispheric fullerene, the tip can
serve as a chemical probe. What makes them even more appealing is their
durability. Fellow researcher Daniel Colbert explains that although they tried to
"crash," or damage, the tubes, the inherent flexibility allows them to return to
their original shape.<P>

To make nanotubes, the team vaporized carbon with an electric current. The vapor
condenses to form a sooty gob, rich in nanotubes. The workers mine the clump with
cellophane tape, and then, holding a glue-dipped conventional tip, they lightly
touch it to the wad of nanotube bundles and gingerly pull one out.<P>

A continent away, scientists at the IBM Zurich Research Laboratory incorporated
buckyballs for a less practical purpose: a smaller-than-Lilliputian-size abacus.
Researcher James Gimzewski and his colleagues lined up buckyballs on a
multigrooved copper plate, mimicking beads on a string, and proceeded to
manipulate the beads with a scanning tunneling microscope (STM), using them to
calculate. The authors write in <I>Applied Physics Letters</I> that because
hundreds of buckyballs can fit in the width of a processor chip, they could be
exploited in building a better computer chip. That vision, though, may be a while
in coming, considering how slow the computation is. Gimzewski notes that moving
the buckyballs with an STM probe is the equivalent of operating a standard abacus
with the Eiffel Tower. But by showing what is possible, buckyballs are starting
to score big in the small field of nanotechnology.

<CENTER><H2>PATRICIA D. MOEHLMAN</H2>

<B>Into the Wilds of Africa</B></center>


<P>Even on the soft, cream-colored carpet of her sparsely decorated house in
Connecticut, Patricia D. Moehlman camps out. She takes off her running shoes,
sits cross-legged on the floor and hunches over the small, white board on which
she is projecting slides in the bright light of a fall afternoon. As she wends
her way pictorially through decades of research on the social lives of jackals,
work on the plight of wild asses in the war-torn Horn of Africa and her
educational projects in Tanzania, Moehlman's joy about being out in the field is
palpable. She seems to delight in every face-canine, equid or human-and in every
landscape she has photographed.<P>

Although she is showing "very few" slides this particular day, they are still
very many. Moehlman has been in Africa for more than 25 years, and she has
documented a great deal. Famous for her observations that jackals hardly deserve
their ill repute as skulking, slippery scavengers, Moehlman is also renowned for
conducting biological surveys in Ngorongoro and the Udzungwa Mountains and for
her conservation work in general.<P>

Moehlman is especially outspoken about ensuring that Tanzanian scientists play
the major role in studying Tanzanian wildlife and resources--not always a popular
position among foreign researchers. But when Moehlman laughs, a very deep, almost
gritty, unyielding strength is revealed--the sound suggests the Tanzanians have
an unflappable ally.<P>

The daughter of academics, Moehlman grew up first on a farm in Iowa and then in
the countryside near Austin, Tex., and was always outdoors. After majoring in
biology at Wellesley College, she had just returned to graduate school in
Texas--where she studied rodent species on Mustang Island in the Gulf of
Mexico--when she heard that Jane Goodall needed assistants. Moehlman, whose
father had avidly read Theodore Roosevelt's African adventures, says living in
Africa had been a dream since she was young.<P>

So Moehlman abandoned her rodents on their island and, in 1967, moved to East
Africa to work with Goodall and her then husband, Hugo van Lawick. During her
stay, the couple turned their attention away from chimpanzees for a while to
conduct research for a book--<I>Innocent Killers</I>--about hyenas, jackals and
wild dogs. So, for several months, Moehlman closely watched golden jackals in
Ngorongoro Crater.<P>

She returned to the U.S., moved on to the University of Wisconsin to do doctoral
work, then settled down in Death Valley National Monument in California to
observe feral asses. Moehlman camped alone there for nearly two years, trailing
the descendants of the donkeys that the Spanish brought with them in the
1500s--descendants, in turn, of the wild asses found in northeast Africa. (These
feral asses continue to be a flash point for controversy because they are
considered nonnative and ecologically destructive. Moehlman thinks of them
slightly differently: she points out that the mother genus, <I>Equus, </I>evolved
in North America--so the burros of Death Valley may have simply come home.)<P>

Moehlman ultimately determined that habitat and resource availability dictated
the social structure of these wild equids. In arid areas, the stable group would
consist of a female and her foal, whereas in regions with lusher vegetation, the
stable group was a harem of many females guarded by one or two males. Moehlman
argues that large social groups form more easily when one individual's foraging
does not adversely affect another's. When food is limited, however, social
organization is reduced to a basic unit: mother and offspring.<P>

Moehlman returned to the wild plains of Africa in 1974 and began studying golden
and silverbacked jackals on her own--becoming the first woman to get permission
to do biological research in the Serengeti. Her years as "jackal woman" had
begun. "Out in the field, it was good," she recalls. "It is a great gift to watch
animals so intimately."<P>

Jackals are unusual in that they are monogamous--only 3 percent of mammals
pair-bond--and the male and female participate equally in raising pups. At the
very beginning of her fieldwork, Moehlman noticed something else unusual about
jackal families: they use au pairs. These helpers, as Moehlman came to call them,
come from the previous year's litter. They stick around for the next season,
helping their parents feed and guard the new pups while continuing to act
submissively. This arrangement allows helpers to become more experienced, making
success more likely once they set out on their own. According to kin selection
theory, which tries to explain animal behavior in terms of relatedness, the
helpers are on average as related to their siblings as they would be to their
offspring; therefore, investment in the survival of their younger sisters and
brothers makes good genetic sense. Helpers clearly make a choice about whether to
stay or go. If they do stay, they must delay their own reproduction--which may
not be a bad idea, because it may not be easy to find a mate or a territory in a
given year.<P>

Moehlman's jackal discoveries were based on careful identification of
individuals: a torn ear, a scar above the muzzle, a dark patch on the tail. She
explains that radio-collaring may interfere with survival; further, there is only
one spot, about one inch in diameter on the rump, where it is safe to shoot a
tranquilizer dart into the small animal. Otherwise, the impact will break bones
or damage organs. "I have my gut-level response. I don't want to hurt animals. In
addition, it is bad science to intervene with animals in ways that affect their
behavior and survival," Moehlman explains. She goes on to say that after years of
following research in the Serengeti, she has come to believe that handling
animals may interfere in those ways--a belief that is not widely embraced,
Moehlman admits: "I am slowly figuring out that if you have opinions you want to
express, and they are not part of the general consensus, there is a price to be
paid."<P>

Moehlman has particular views about other forms of interference as well,
including certain approaches to experimentation. "I would rather take more time
and let natural experiments occur and try to understand the components of what is
going on," she maintains. She notes that some scientists advised her to remove a
helper from a jackal family to determine what its role was. Moehlman counters
that if she had removed a helper from, say, a golden jackal family and the pups
had died, she might have concluded that helpers consistently ensured pup
survival. <P>

Her fieldwork presents a more complex picture. In the first place, some helpers
are more peripheral to the family and do not contribute as much. In the second, a
parent with a helper may hunt less--and the pups would get the same amount of
food as they would have if there were no helper--or the parent may hunt just as
much, which means pups would get more food, and so more may survive. Because all
individuals in the family are different and change their behavior to reflect
varying circumstances, one needs to spend long hours watching the details of
behavior to understand the dynamics of cooperative breeding. <P>

After nearly a decade in the Serengeti and Ngorongoro--punctuated by sorties to
teach and write at Yale and Cambridge universities and to study feral asses in
the Galpagos Islands--Moehlman had fallen in love with Tanzania. And she had
become very aware that there were few Tanzanians studying wildlife resources.
"Let the Tanzanians be the folks for the long term. They care about Tanzania,"
she states emphatically. "I care about Tanzania, I care about Tanzanians. But I
am not a Tanzanian. I won't stay there forever. And it needs to be in the hands
of the nationals."<P>

So Moehlman set about raising funds for students at the University of Dar es
Salaam. "Fifteen hundred dollars meant the difference between someone completing
a master's and not. Eight hundred dollars meant the difference between a whole
class going out and doing a field trip and not. They are not big sums of money."
She also established relations with expert biologists around the world, and, so
far, about 10 Tanzanians have been able to do graduate work in Tanzania and
abroad. Moehlman herself has taught students to conduct biological surveys. "It
is the building block for understanding the ecology of the area," Moehlman says.
"It also lets the undergraduates know all the possibilities of what you can do
out there."<P>

Her most recent scientific efforts also involve working with and training
nationals, this time in the Horn of Africa. There, in the harsh deserts of
Eritrea, Somalia and Ethiopia, the world's most endangered equid, the African
wild ass, is barely surviving. Although her surveys were interrupted by civil
war, Moehlman has made several visits since 1989, trying to count animals, to
interview local people and to establish protected areas. In the past 20 years,
according to Moehlman, the wild ass population fell from between six and 30 per
100 square kilometers to one or two. The accessibility of guns has made it easy
to hunt the wild ass--a source of folk medicine for tuberculosis, constipation
and backache.<P>

Nevertheless, her forays seem to have had some impact. "I am coming from a long
way away, so people are real impressed that I think it is important," she laughs.
"They say that if I had not shown up and discussed the wildlife's plight with
them, all the asses would be gone now." Many of the Afar and Issa people of the
region--often somewhat taken aback by the appearance of a woman--explain that
although they recognize its endangered status, the occasional wild ass can mean
the difference between someone starving or not.<P>

One Afar elder recounted a tale to illustrate this point, "sort of an interesting
story for a desert people," Moehlman notes: A woman is standing in the water with
her child on her hip; the water rises, and the woman puts the child on her
shoulder; the water rises, and the woman puts the child on her head; the water
rises, she stands on the child. True to form, Moehlman responded: "There are many
things the woman can do. She can swim to shore. She can build a boat." <I>Equus
africanus </I>appears to be in good hands.

<H1>A <BR>Picture-Perfect <BR>Comet</H1>
</CENTER>
<I>by Shawn Carlson</I>
<P>
I spent my formative years in what was then rural San Diego County. Our front porch opened onto an expanse of foothills so wild that we often startled coyotes away from our front yard when we retrieved the morning paper. The night sky was absolutely dazzling, and the millions of stars overhead enticed me out to enjoy them in secret.
<P>
Throughout the summer that separated second from third grade, my head never hit the pillow before I was scheming that night's escape. I had recently heard about Halley's comet--of its famous appearance of 1910 and of its imminent return. So, armed with a noisy party favor to scare off the coyotes, I posted scores of predawn hours atop a nearby hill, fully expecting to be the first person to see the comet on its return journey. By the time autumn's chill finally drove me off my hill, I felt utterly defeated. Only years later did I discover that I had misheard the year of Halley's return as 1968 instead of 1986.
<P>
In the decades since that disappointment, I've continued my love affair with the night sky, but I've never seen a cometary display to match the description of Halley's 1910 appearance. Halley's pathetic showing in 1986 left that stiff-lipped little boy within me still waiting for the heavens to redeem themselves.
<P>
Well, it looks like they finally might. Comet Hale-Bopp (C/1995 O1) looks even more impressive than it did just a month ago. The comet's nucleus is at least three times larger than Comet Halley's, and it has been ejecting bright jets of dust for many months. Some astronomers now believe Hale-Bopp may be the brightest comet this century. Here's how to make a detailed photographic record of the comet's passage.
<P>
If you think that so many pictures are going to be taken of this comet that yours can't be scientifically useful, think again. Professional astronomers want your help. A comet's tail changes rapidly, and the professionals need an army of observers to track these changes. For example, every few days, when the magnetic field created by the solar wind changes direction, the gas tail can separate from the comet's head. The comet can repair these "disconnection events" in just 30 minutes; you could be the only person who records it.
<P>
With a good 35-millimeter camera (single-lens reflex), a few lens attachments and a little practice, you can take vivid portraits of Hale-Bopp. Manual cameras are better for this work than the newer electronic automatic models. They perform better in cold weather, and you never risk a power failure during a long exposure. Try to find one that will let you lock up the internal mirror so that it won't jar the camera when you trip the shutter. If, while prowling around a used camera shop, you find a much coveted Olympus OM-1, Nikon F series or Pentax LX, buy it! Finally, because any vibration can spoil your image, you'll also need a cable release (available through camera supply companies for about $20) to activate the shutter without touching the camera.
<P>
When it comes to film, there is a trade-off between speed and grain size. Faster films require shorter exposures to catch the same detail, but they have a larger grain size and so give poorer resolution. As a general rule, you should use the slowest film your subject will allow, but nothing slower than ISO 400. Many astronomers prefer black-and-white film for its superior resolution. Kodak's T-Max 400 gives excellent results. If you decide to take color pictures, Fuji's Super G 800 and Kodak's Royal Gold 1000 get high marks for prints, and for slides Kodak's Ektachrome P1600 nudges out Fuji's Provia 1600 in side-by-side comparisons. 
<P>
The correct exposure time depends on too many factors to guess accurately. The best advice is to shoot the comet at several exposures ranging from 10 seconds to 10 minutes. In general, a wide-angle lens requires shorter exposures than a telephoto lens of the same aperture, and the larger the aperture of the lens, the shorter the required exposure time. After reviewing the results of a roll or two, you should be able to narrow the range of exposure times.
<P>
The earth's rotation steadily shifts the sky, causing stars (and comets) to create curved streaks on any extended-exposure picture taken by a stationary camera. To compensate, you'll need to shift the camera with the sky throughout the exposure for any exposure longer than one minute. If you have a telescope with a sidereal drive, you can buy a piggyback mount to attach your camera to the telescope. (Lumicon in Livermore, Calif., sells one for $60; telephone: 510-447-9570.) Battery-operated drives for cameras are also available but very expensive. (Pocono Mountain Optics in Daleville, Pa., sells one for $295; telephone: 800-569-4323 or 717-842-1500.) Or you can build a hand guider for less than $20. This design comes compliments of Dennis Mammana, resident astronomer of the Fleet Space Theater and Science Center in San Diego, and is the product of the collective cleverness of Dennis and other gifted astrophotographers. By manually twisting the adjusting screw one quarter turn every 15 seconds, you can eliminate star trails for up to 10 minutes on wide-field shots. Or use a high-torque DC motor powered by a car battery to turn the screw, then sit back and enjoy the comet.
<P>
Many astrophotographers take beautiful wide-angle portraits of comets that contrast the feathery tails against a stark landscape. Though often stunning, these images fail to capture many of the tail's most interesting features. Better science requires a closer view. The ideal field of view for recording tail features is about five degrees, which requires a lens with a 400-millimeter focal length. Because the tail may extend 20 degrees or more, you'll need to make a mosaic of images to catch the whole comet. 
<P>
Remember, the longer the shutter is open, the more bad things can happen to your picture, so keep exposures as short as possible. This means you want a "fast"--that is, wide aperture--lens. The highest-quality 400-millimeter lenses can cost up to $6,000. Don't fret if you have to go to a shorter lens and a wider angle. A standard 135-millimeter telephoto is still scientifically useful. You will have to do some market research and balance your budget against the science you wish to accomplish. If possible, avoid mirror telephoto lenses and zoom lenses, whose optics are generally unsuitable for the sharp contrasts of astrophotography.
<P>
A few things to keep in mind: To help avoid darkroom catastrophes, begin each roll of film with a well-lit picture of something--anything. Without a reference image, darkroom technicians often can't identify the edges of a starry frame and sometimes miscut the film (to eliminate the risk entirely, many astrophotographers have their slides or negatives returned uncut). Also, carefully log the date, time and sky conditions for every observation you make. Most important, you must commit yourself to a regular observing schedule. A series of consistent observations made from the same site over many nights is much more valuable than a scattering of disjointed observations taken around the world. To do the job right, you've got to be out there on every clear night possible.

Review by <A HREF="#author">Jeffrey L. Meikle</A>

<P><B>Plastic: The Making of a Synthetic Century</B>
<BR>BY STEPHEN FENICHELL
<BR><A HREF="http://www.harpercollins.com/business/">HarperBusiness,</A> 1996 ($25)</center>


<P>First impressions of Plastic are encouraging. The dust jacket of Stephen
Fenichell's historical survey of plastic in American life displays a life-size
jumble of brightly colored plastic knives, forks and spoons. The inside flap
promises a "fresh, irreverent look at the substance we all love to hate." A blurb
by Douglas Coupland, the chronicler of Generation X, declares the book to be
"oddly funny, grippingly readable, and crammed with wads of cool facts that make
you see the twentieth century in a whole new light." More than a generation older
and possessed of a darker vision, Norman Mailer rejoices that here at last, "for
anyone who hates plastic and likes good writing," is a book "to satisfy your
anger, your pleasure, and your instinctive judgment."

<P>Having recently published a scholarly history of plastic, I picked up
Fenichell's attractively packaged survey with keen anticipation; I was curious to
see how a freelance journalist would interpret synthetic materials in a book for
a popular audience. Fenichell advances a clear notion of the significance of
plastic: it "combines the ultimate twentieth-century
characteristics--artificiality, disposability, and synthesis--all rolled into
one." The proliferation of plastic in everyday life indicates "the victory of
package over product, of style over substance, of surface over essence."

<P>Unfortunately, the book displays similar qualities. Despite its outward
promise, it is riddled with errors of fact and of interpretation. All that
<I>Plastic</I> has going for it is a genuine enthusiasm for the protean
manifestations of synthetic materials.

<P>Fenichell's narrative proceeds chronologically, driven by anecdotal tales of
eccentric entrepreneurs and serendipitous inventions. It starts with
"protoplastics" such as vulcanized rubber in the mid-19th century and winds up
among the engineered polymers of the 1980s. Along the way the author traces the
progress of celluloid from billiard balls to motion-picture film, surveys the
development of cellophane, rayon and nylon, and details the 1950s explosion of
plastic consumer goods, from Tupperware to hula hoops.

<P>The chapters are uneven in quality, varying with the types of sources
Fenichell apparently relied on ("apparently" because the book contains neither
references nor bibliography--not even the suggested readings essential to any
popularization of science or technology). When Fenichell clearly follows a major
source--as he does when discussing nylon--the narrative line is relatively
strong. But when no such source was available, as in the chapters on the 1950s
and 1960s, the text becomes a disorganized mosaic of catchily titled subsections
each defined, or perhaps generated, by whatever newspaper or magazine articles
happened to be at hand.

<P>Even so, <I>Plastic</I> is sometimes entertaining, offering historical glosses
on such fascinating topics as the Crystal Palace exhibition of 1851, for which
Charles Goodyear commissioned a "Vulcanite Court" whose walls, vaulted roof and
contents were all fabricated from hard rubber. In the midst of tracing the
development of celluloid movie film, Fenichell pauses to tell the story of the
Lumire brothers of France, whose projection system delivered moving images to a
large audience, a major improvement over Thomas Edison's kinetoscope with its
peepshow audience of one.

<P>We also learn about the development of a plastic bugle, intended to conserve
precious copper during World War II. Although familiar with the bugle itself, I
was unaware of the intriguing story behind it (which makes the absence of solid
documentation all the more frustrating). Reluctantly procured by a U.S. Army
quartermaster officer who preferred brass, the prototype was hurled against a
brick wall before being tested by the military's top bugler as scientific
instruments measured the accuracy of its tone. An order for 200,000 followed.

<P>At first glance the information set out in <I>Plastic</I> all seems plausible,
and unsuspecting readers might naturally assume that Fenichell knows what he is
talking about. But Plastic contains so many inaccuracies that it simply cannot be
trusted. When Fenichell tells the story of Formica, for instance, he garbles the
first name of one of its inventors and the last name of the other; he goes on to
weave a tale of their entrepreneurial success that is distinctly at odds with the
facts.

<P>Also, Daniel O'Conor and Herbert Faber did not leave Westinghouse--where they
developed the product first sold about 1910 as "Micarta"--because the company
would not manufacture their invention. Instead they went into business for
themselves (infringing Westinghouse patents to produce the first Formica in 1913)
so that they could cut into Westinghouse's near monopoly of an expanding market.

<P>Errors in dating, both explicit and implicit, are even more prevalent
throughout the book. J. B. Dunlop commercialized the pneumatic tire in 1888, not
during the 1910s (when it would have come far too late to play its essential role
in the cycling craze of the 1890s). And Bobby Darin landed his first recording
contract in 1957; he was not, as Fenichell implies, a hit singer in 1948. Such
compressions of time are common in the book, collapsing events separated by years
into an undifferentiated historical present. Fenichell merges the Art Deco style
of the late 1920s with the distinctive streamlining of the mid-1930s, then goes
on to conflate two years of changes in Du Pont's nylon exhibit at the 1939-1940
New York World's Fair into a single event.

<P>In fact, the company put its new synthetic fiber through a series of
successively more dramatic displays at the World's Fair in response to the
incessant clamor of visitors intent on seeing nylon stockings. The exhibit
started as a dull scientific display, progressed to an impromptu fashion show and
culminated in an extravaganza in which a mysterious "Miss Chemistry" emerged from
a test tube to display her nylon-clad legs. Fenichell ignores these telling
changes and tosses in a description of mechanical hands endlessly stretching a
nylon stocking--a demonstration that New York visitors never saw, because it
appeared only at San Francisco's Golden Gate Exposition of 1939.

<P><I>Plastic</I> abounds with such errors. Although Fenichell tells us that
British scientists discovered polyethylene during World War II, he later
correctly traces its discovery to 1933. Twice he states that Nazi Germany did not
manufacture polyethylene; in reality, the U.S. Army captured an intact
polyethylene plant at the end of the war. Norman Mailer is misquoted, with one of
his sinuous riffs chopped into three short sentences for easy reading.

<P>It appears that Fenichell was ill served by his editors at HarperBusiness, who
also let numerous stylistic oddities pass and even missed a glaring typo in the
book's opening sentence. But no amount of editing could repair a book whose
research is so casually flawed. The author seems to consider facts to be as
malleable as plastic. As long as the surface is seamless, artificially smooth and
styled for entertainment, why should anyone question the book's deeper substance?
Plastic is a simulacrum corresponding only approximately to reality.

<P>At one time, I might have referred to this sort of publishing as just another
example of "plastic." But my own research has made me aware that such a dismissal
trivializes synthetic materials' complex, ambiguous contributions to the 20th
century. In choosing surface over substance, Fenichell merely glides over the
rich details.

Review by <A HREF="#author">Timothy Ferris</A>

<P><B>RealSky CD: The Palomar<BR>Observatory Sky Survey </B>
<BR><A HREF="http://www.aspsky.org/html/catalog/realsky/introduction.html">Astronomical Society of<BR> the Pacific,</A> 1996
<BR>(Nine compact discs; PC or <BR>Macintosh format, $250)</center>


<P>The release of the RealSky CD-ROM collection provides a dramatic example of the
growing egalitarian power of the personal computer. Rarely has so powerful a
research tool been placed within the grasp of amateur scientists. These discs
bring to the general public a digital edition of what has long been an icon of
astronomical exclusivity: the coveted photographic plates of the National
Geographic Society-Palomar Observatory Sky Survey.

<P>The POSS plates, as they are known, constitute the world's most comprehensive
atlas of the northern skies. Accumulated over nine years of photography using the
48-inch Oschin Schmidt telescope atop Palomar Mountain in southern California,
they cover nearly the entire sky visible from that latitude, imaged in both red-
and blue-sensitive emulsions, down to the 20th magnitude in red light (roughly
500,000 times fainter than can be seen with the naked eye).

<P>Since their publication in 1958, the POSS plates have been indispensable to
professional astronomers. It was by poring over them that Bart Bok identified the
"Bok globules" wherein new stars form and that George Abell discovered the many
galaxy clusters that still bear his name. Hundreds of observers have used them to
distinguish supernovae and uncharted asteroids from ordinary stars, and many
thousands more undoubtedly have wished they could do so. But a full set of the
1,870 POSS plates cost $15,000, enough to limit their possession to professional
observatories and a few exceedingly well heeled amateurs.

<P>The revolution began when a team at the Space Telescope Science Institute in
Baltimore scanned into a computer the images on the 14-inch-square glass POSS
plates. This initial effort yielded a third of a terabyte of raw data, stored on
55 gleaming silver laser discs--an imposing collection, but one so unwieldy that
the workers developed a compression algorithm to boil down the data by a factor
of 10.

<P>The compressed version, commonly known as the 10X POSS, was released in 1994
on 102 compact discs, at a price of $3,500 per set. It is now available on the
World Wide Web from the <A HREF="http://
stdatu.stsci.edu/dss/dss_form.html">Hubble Space Telescope Data Archive.</A>The
10X POSS is useful for those who want to scrutinize a particular patch of sky,
but it is too massive to appeal to browsers. With a 28.8-baud modem, it can take
more than three hours to download a field one degree on a side--about the area
visible at low power through a typical amateur telescope. To accomplish at home
the kind of serendipitous sky browsing that benefited Bok and Abell, one needs
ready access to a complete digital POSS, at a manageable price.

<P>Now we have it. RealSky consists of the red-light POSS plates (the ones most
observers favor, because they bring out the ruddy glow of interstellar nebulae),
compressed to 1 percent of their original volume and squeezed into nine CDs for
$250. Elegantly housed in a star-studded case no larger than a boxed set of the
complete Mahler symphonies, RealSky is intelligently designed and delightfully
easy to use. Boot up any disc, click on the "target list," and you are presented
with a catalogue of bright, deep-sky objects that includes many of the galaxies
and nebulae observers know best. Hit "view," and you have on your computer screen
a sharp POSS plate segment showing the selected object at its center.

<P>The image can be manipulated in several useful ways. It can be rendered as
positive or negative (white sky background), superimposed with an east-north
orientation mark, modified in brightness and contrast, sharpened or smoothed, and
so forth; the image can also be exported to other graphics programs for further
enhancement. Handy buttons on the screen make it easy to zoom in and out, to
shrink or enlarge the field of view, and to pan across the sky. Moving the mouse
pointer around on the plate instantly displays its location on the sky, accurate
to better than one second of arc. Alternatively, one can select a site by
coordinates alone. This exceptionally powerful and felicitous program is like a
musical instrument, limited less by its own structure than by the proficiency and
expertise of the user.

<P>But how much has been lost in reducing the POSS data by a factor of 100? To
find out, I downloaded an image of the distorted spiral galaxy NGC 3027 from the
Hubble Space Telescope Web site (where the plates are compressed only by a factor
of 10) and compared it with a RealSky depiction of the same galaxy. At first
glance the two photographs looked remarkably similar. But when I viewed them
through a digital blink comparitor--a system that ashes back and forth between
the two, so that differences leap out to the eye--it was evident that a number of
dim stars visible in the 10X POSS plate had vanished in the RealSky version, as
had much of the galaxy's outer envelope.

<P>The results were happier when I tested RealSky against the real sky. I printed
out a dozen galaxy fields on a laser printer in preparation for undertaking a
visual search for supernovae through the 0.46-meter reecting telescope at Rocky
Hill Observatory, located 100 kilometers north of San Francisco. The brightness
of the sky at that location limits the telescope's grasp for such work to about
magnitude 14.5, fairly typical of the conditions encountered by amateur
astronomers in today's light-polluted world.

<P>To find a supernova, one must notice a star that was not evident before. The
finder chart should, therefore, show all the stars in the sky, down to the
observer's limiting magnitude. RealSky passed this test effortlessly. In every
case, it represented galaxies in a way that was passably close to their visual
appearance, and it covered all the stars I could see. Observers using
charge-coupled devices, or CCDs (electronic light detectors), and big telescopes
under truly dark skies will see more than RealSky records, but in many cases, the
same would be true even if they were using the original, uncompressed POSS.

<P>Further improving its utility, RealSky can interface with TheSky, a popular
commercial planetarium program [see "Hands-on Astronomy," by Timothy Ferris;
Reviews and Commentaries, Scientific American, February 1996]. An appropriately
updated version of TheSky can superimpose POSS images onto its digital sky charts
at the correct scale and orientation. The results look crude and may involve a
bit of disc swapping, but they vastly enhance the reach of TheSky and point the
way toward better things to come.

<P>Digital egalitarianism is taking place in many fields of science, but its
consequences are particularly stunning in astronomy. POSS-II, a new Palomar
survey now being completed in three bands (blue, red and far-red) is being
digitized, and many compressed POSS-II plates are already available on the Space
Telescope Science Institute Web site. These images make it possible for students
or dedicated dabblers to make genuine discoveries--for instance, identifying
transient phenomena by blink-comparing the same piece of sky as photographed at
dates decades apart. POSS-II will also probably make the transition to home use,
probably on digital videodiscs (DVDs) the size of CDs but having 10 times the
data capacity and read speed.

<P>Anyone who fears that digital technology threatens to turn humans into a race
of navel-gazing couch potatoes need look no further than these ongoing sky
surveys, which invite us to gaze not at the pointing finger but at the stars.

<P><B>SPINELESS WONDERS: STRANGE TALES FROM THE INVERTEBRATE WORLD,</B> <BR><I>by
Richard Conniff. <A HREF="http://www.obs-us.com/obs/english/books/holt/index.htm">Henry Holt,</A> 1996 ($25).</I>

<P>Ants, worms, slime eels: the invertebrate world holds a repugnant fascination.
Close up, many of these creatures are not only intriguing but beautiful and--in
the case of tarantulas--even a bit cuddly. How many people know that eelskin
wallets are a product of the hagfish, a boneless genus more than 200 million
years old? Before the exotic-leather boom, the hagfish was best known for its
ability to tie itself in a knot and to suffocate would-be predators by exuding
masses of slime.

<P><HR><B>THE BIOLOGICAL UNIVERSE: THE TWENTIETH-CENTURY EXTRATERRESTRIAL LIFE
DEBATE AND THE LIMITS OF SCIENCE,</B> <BR><I>by Steven J. Dick. <A HREF="http://www.cup.org/">Cambridge
University Press,</A> 1996 ($54.95).</I>

<P>Steven J. Dick, a historian at the U.S. Naval Observatory, has written a
sober, exhaustively researched analysis of popular and scientific attitudes
toward alien life. He picks apart topics ranging from UFOs to the Search for
Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) to the ever shifting ideas on the origin of
life. The book's measured tone sometimes verges on the comically deadpan, but its
wealth of detail offers a welcome perspective above the current media din about
life on Mars.

<P><HR><B>THOUGHT CONTAGION: HOW BELIEF SPREADS THROUGH SOCIETY,</B> <BR><I>by
Aaron Lynch. <A HREF="http://www.harpercollins.com/basic/">BasicBooks,</A> 1996 ($24).</I>

<P>Can epidemiology be a valid tool for understanding the spread of ideas? Some
scientists argue that memes, or individual units of belief, spread like diseases
and compete with one another much as genes compete in biological evolution. Aaron
Lynch's account of the "science of memes" is fun but ultimately facile-memes
appear simply to stand in for older, less trendy concepts about social evolution
and sociobiology. And the specter of infinite regression (the concept of memes is
a meme, as is the concept of the concept of memes, and so on) is enough to make a
postmodernist's head spin.

<P>For most people-those who do not have access to fume hoods and acid-resistant
gloves-this book of chemical recipes should be for reading and daydreaming only.
But the photographs and descriptions of spectacular demonstrations, ranging from
underwater fire to invisible inks, will delight anyone with an interest in the
materials from which our world is made. The authors also include a remarkable
array of passages from the history of chemistry.

<P><HR><B>BETRAYAL OF SCIENCE AND REASON,</B> <BR><I>by Paul R. Ehrlich and Anne
H. Ehrlich. <A HREF="http://www.islandpress.com/">Island Press,</A> 1996 ($24.95). </I><P><B>THE ULTIMATE RESOURCE
2,</B> <BR><I>by Julian L. Simon. <A HREF="http://aaup.pupress.princeton.edu:70/1/books/presses/princeton">Princeton University Press,</A> 1996 ($35).</I>

<P>The near-simultaneous release of these two books is the environmentalist
equivalent of the "Rumble in the Jungle." Paul and Anne Ehrlich deliver a
stinging rebuttal of the antienvironmental "brownlash," whereas Julian Simon
equally vehemently attacks green notions of resource scarcity. There are
revealing excesses on both sides-Simon proclaims that resources are effectively
infinite. After the dust settles, these books make a persuasive case for a middle
ground between capitalist innovation and preservationist caretaking.

<P><HR><B>HOW NATURE WORKS: THE SCIENCE OF SELF-ORGANIZED CRITICALITY,</B>
<BR><I>by Per Bak. <A HREF="http://www.springer-ny.com/copernicus/coper.html">Copernicus,</A> 1996 ($27).</I>

<P>As the title hints, Per Bak is not shy about the claims he makes for his
research on self-organized criticality, the tendency of systems to experience
periods of stasis followed by sharp transitions to a new state of equilibrium.
Sometimes he overreaches, as when trying to explain the workings of the brain. On
the whole, however, Bak has concocted a profoundly fresh way of viewing the
world-one in which earthquakes, mass extinctions and collapsing piles of sand all
express the same, episodic rules written into the laws of nature.

<P><HR><B>SHIPS AND SHIPWRECKS OF THE AMERICAS: A HISTORY BASED ON UNDERWATER ARCHAEOLOGY,</B>
<BR><I>Edited by George F. Bass. <A HREF="http://www.wwnorton.com/thames/welcome.htm">Thames and Hudson,</A> 1996 
(paperbound, $24.95).</I>

<P>On Christmas Eve of 1492, the Santa Mara--the flagship of Christopher
Columbuss mission of discovery--became the first European ship wrecked in
American waters. Many others followed; between 1492 and 1520 alone, at least 50
sailing vessels sank in and around the Caribbean. Since the proliferation of
scuba diving in the 1950s, many of these wrecks have been discovered, excavated
or even salvaged. This book describes in splendid detail some of the most
spectacular or unusual finds, including four ships bound for Spain from Veracruz
that wrecked off Padre Island in 1554. A large galleon, the Conde de Tolosa, was
on its way to Mexico with mercury for silver production when it sank off
Hispaniola in 1724. George F. Bass has skillfully edited essays by 12
contributors into a seamless, readable whole; the illustrations, too, are
numerous and of good quality. The main drawback to this affordable paperback
reissue is that it seems not to have been revised since its original release in
1988, so it lacks a discussion of how remotely operated vehicles and technical
diving are transforming marine archaeology. For the average reader, however, this
book serves as a fascinating lesson that there is a lot more to the Caribbean
than pina coladas and Club Med.

<P><HR><B>LEONARDO da VINCI.</B>
<BR><A HREF="http://www.corbis.com/"><I>Corbis,</A> 1996. CD-ROM for Windows or Macintosh, $35.</I>

<P>Although it does contain broad overviews of Leonardo's life and work, the real
focus of this disc is the Codex Leicester, a collection of 36 folios penned by
Leonardo around 1508 that contain his insights into a variety of natural
phenomena. (The Codex Leicester was acquired in 1994 by Bill Gates, who, not
coincidentally, owns Corbis.) Leonardo da Vinci's primary innovation is a set of
clever viewing tools that let the user examine English translations of the Codex
superimposed onto lavish facsimiles of its pages. Leonardo's studies still make
fascinating reading; he deduced, quite accurately, that reflected light from the
earth illuminates the whole of the crescent moon and clearly explained why the
distribution of fossils could not be explained by the Biblical flood. The rest of
the disc is beautifully designed but oddly sparse. Instructional "guided tours"
(slide shows, really) fail to provide a depth of analysis to match Leonardo's
brilliant scientific gropings.

<H2>Waving the Flag</H2>


I was gazing up at the Stars and Stripes during a ceremony recently in
Washington, D.C., and thinking about how things might have been if Lord North,
George III's prime minister, who fatally underestimated the American colonists,
hadn't been off for the weekend when the Revolution (sorry: War of Independence)
broke out. Probably nothing, because French financial backing for the rebels
(sorry: patriots) had made sure, long before, that the U.S. would end up the
U.S., as there was little the French wanted more than to cock a snook at the
Brits. Some snook.

The whole incredible scam was masterminded by a character named Caron de
Beaumarchais, who had made the flattest wristwatch anybody had ever seen for
Madame de Pompadour and written a play (later snitched by Mozart) called <I>The
Barber of Seville</I>. Beaumarchais was the CIA before the CIA. After 1773 he
went on a spying mission to London and reported back that the British grip on
America was weakening and that Louis XV would be well advised to take advantage
of the situation. Louis put Beaumarchais in charge, leaving him to set up a fake
firm (Roderigue, Hortales and Co.) for laundering funds and chartering a fleet to
land nighttime shipments of arms, ammo and "technical advisers" on the American
eastern seaboard. Right under the Brits' noses.<P>

<P>As I mentioned, it all worked rather too well. And also bankrupted France (as
a result of which the economy gradually fell apart, and they had their own
revolution, in 1789), despite the best efforts of Louis XVI's director general of
finance, Jacques Necker, who cooked the books and almost convinced everyone the
country wasn't going down the tubes. Not almost enough, though.<P>

<P>Earlier on in his career, in 1776, while running the department of Hrault in
southern France, Necker had been approached by the young Swiss inventor of a new
method of distilling. This fellow was Aim Argand, and a few years later, he lit
up the place with his next gadget, a kind of oil lamp with a round, hollow wick.
A circulating current of air kept the flame bright, and a glass chimney kept it
steady. Emitting the light of eight candles, the lamp got rapidly used for
lifesaving purposes in lighthouses, to illuminate the night shift at the Boulton
and Watt steam-engine factory in Birmingham and, in February 1785, to stupefy
audiences at London's Drury Lane Theater.<P>

<P>The idea of footlights was pioneered by the theater's actor-manager, David
Garrick, whose amazing Shakespearean portrayals had introduced the modern,
realist style of acting. He quite impressed a newly arrived Swiss painter named
Angelica Kauffmann, so much so that she possibly had an affair with Garrick and
definitely painted his portrait (and that of almost anybody else of note in
England). Kauffmann came from the hotbed of nouveau neoclassicism, the artists'
colony in Rome, and she and her new style of painting, inspired by the recent
excavations at Pompeii, took England by storm. Not quite storm enough, though.
When in 1773 she applied for the commission to decorate Sir Christopher Wren's
masterpiece, St. Paul's Cathedral, well, sorry, but she was foreign and Papist,
and no thanks.<P>

<P>Wren himself wouldn't have cared. He was so High Anglican he was practically
Catholic. He was also one of those Renaissance men of the kind people nowadays
say never existed. Maybe not, but the breadth of his scholarship was nothing
short of humongous. Apart from inventing pens that wrote in duplicate and
odometers for carriages, he was expert in math, barometric studies, exploration,
scientific illustration and city planning. Also, he wrote an algebraic work, when
he was young, relating to something called the Julian period.<P>

<P>This was a great new chronological scheme, dreamed up in 1582 by Joseph Justus
Scaliger, French scholar and peripatetic Protestant exile. The reasoning went
that the intervals between historical events could be more accurately determined
by a single chronological scheme for the whole of time, instead of pegging things
to local chronologies based on coronations or battles and such, because such
local chronologies didn't fit with anybody else's. Scaliger calculated his Julian
period (named for his father, Julius Caesar Scaliger) by multiplying the 28-year
solar cycle (when a date recurred on the same day of a seven-day week) by the
19-year lunar cycle (when the phases of the moon recurred on a specific day in
the solar year) by the 15-year "indiction" cycle (based, for reasons best known
to Scaliger, on Diocletian's tax census period). <P>

<P>The sum of 28 years times 19 years times 15 years gave a megacycle of 7,980
years. In this megacycle, any date would be pinpointed according to where it
stood in each of the three minicycles. Scaliger reckoned the last time all three
cycles had coincided (and therefore the last time his megacycle had begun and
when the three dating references would have been 1:1:1) was January 1, 4713 B.C.
This, then, was Scaliger's "Day One" in spades, from which all dates could now be
calculated in a uniform three-cross-reference manner. Well, why not?<P>

<P>Scaliger had learned his stuff at the Calvinist Geneva Academy, and though
while there he never managed to meet Isaac Casaubon, they did later strike up an
undying scholarly friendship (via more than 1,000 letters) on the subject of
Greek and Latin manuscripts and everything else academic. While in Geneva,
Casaubon married (and had 18 children by) Florence, daughter of one of Europe's
most esteemed editors, Henri Estienne, whose family had been in printing almost
since the start, when his grandfather had opened a shop in Paris in 1502.
Estienne's greatest claim to fame was that he discovered, translated and, in
1554, printed the work of a sixth-century B.C. Greek poet called Anacreon, who
mainly wrote erotic poetry and drinking songs.<P>

<P>Estienne's translation caught on all over Europe, and by the 18th century
Anacreon's poetry was so enjoyed in London by well-heeled fun-lovers that in 1776
they formed the Anacreon Society. Aim: meet once every two weeks, get drunk, sing
songs. (Forerunner of modern glee clubs.) One of the society's members was a now
long-forgotten singer and composer who went by the memorable name of John Smith.
When it was decided that the group should have a signature tune, Smith whistled
one up, entitled "To Anacreon in Heaven." The song was soon on the lips of
everybody, from tipsy clubmen who had survived a night out in London to nervous
young American lawyers who had hazarded a night out in Baltimore.<P>

<P>Well, September 13, 1814, had been quite a night, during which the British
fired 1,800 shells at Fort McHenry. One of the young American lawyers in
question, watching from an offshore boat, was so taken with events that he dashed
off a commemorative song on the back of an envelope and set it to John Smith's
tune dedicated to Anacreon. Today it's better known in the version I was
listening to while I watched Old Glory waving aloft in the District of Columbia.
Because Francis Scott Key gave the composition a new title: "The Star-Spangled
Banner."<P>

<P>Inspiration is flagging, so I'll stop.

<H2>How Fast Is Technology<BR> Evolving?</H2><P>

<BR><BR>

My grandfather, for some reason, wore a hat to meals. Some evenings-also
hatted-he would play the fiddle. He was born in Ireland in 1874, and he lived to
see, in his long life, satellites, computers, jet airplanes and the Apollo space
program. He went from a world where illiterate people footed their way on dirt
roads, where one-room schools had peat fires in the corner, where stories were
told at night in shadows and candlelight, to a world of motor cars and
electricity and telephones and radio and x-ray machines and television. He never
left Ireland, although late in life he wanted to go to England in an airplane to
experience flying. But in his lifetime-one lifetime-he witnessed all these
birthings of technology.

<P>It is young, this new technology. It is recent. It has come fast. So fast, in
fact, that speed of evolution is regarded as a signature of technology itself.
But how fast? How quickly does technology evolve? It is hard to clock something
as ill defined as technology's speed of evolution. But we can ask how fast we
would have to speed up the natural, biological evolution of life on our planet to
make it roughly match some particular technology's rate of change.

<P>Let's imagine speeding up biological evolution in history by a factor of 10
million. This would mean that instead of life starting around 3,600 million years
ago, in our fast-forwarded world the first, crude blue-green algae appear 360
years ago, about the year 1640. Multicellular organisms arise in Jane Austen's
time, about 1810 or so, and the great Cambrian explosion that produced the
ancestors of most of today's creatures happens in the early 1930s, the Depression
era. Dinosaurs show up in the late 1960s, then lumber through the 1970s and into
the 1980s. Birds and mammals appear in the mid-1970s but do not come fully into
their own until the 1990s. Humankind emerges only in the past year or two-and as
Homo sapiens only in the past month.
<P>

<IMG SRC="IMG/0297wonders.gif" WIDTH="175" BORDER="0"><br clear=all><FONT
SIZE="1">Image:Dusan Petricic</FONT></td>
</tr></table><P>

<P>Now let's lay this alongside a technology whose speed we want to
measure-calculating machinery, say. We'll put it on the same timeline, but
evolving at its actual rate. Early calculating machines-abacuses-trail back, of
course, into antiquity. But the modern era of mechanical devices starts in the
years surrounding the 1640s, when the first addition, subtraction and
multiplication machines of Wilhelm Schickard, Blaise Pascal and Gottfried Wilhelm
Leibniz begin to appear. These were rudimentary, perhaps, but early computational
life nonetheless. The first successful multicellular devices (machines that use
multiple instructions) are the Jacquard looms of Jane Austen's time. Calculators
and difference engines of varying ingenuity arise and vanish throughout the
1800s. But not until the 1930s-the Cambrian time on our parallel scale--is there a
true explosion. It's then that calculating machines become electrical, the
government goes statistical, and accounting becomes mechanized. The 1960s see the
arrival of large mainframe computers, our parallel to the dinosaurs, and their
dominance lasts through the 1970s and 1980s. Personal computers show up, like
birds and mammals in the mid-1970s, but do not take hold until the late 1980s and
early 1990s.

<P>What then corresponds to humankind, evolution's most peculiar creation to
date? My answer is the Internet or, more specifically, its offshoot, the World
Wide Web. The Web? Well, what counts about the Web is not its technology. That's
still primitive. What counts is that the Web provides access to the stored
memories, the stored experiences of others. And that's what is also particular to
humans: our ability not just to think and experience but to store our thoughts
and experiences and share them with others as needed, in an interactive culture.
What gives us power as humans is not our minds but the ability to share our
minds, the ability to compute in parallel. And it's this sharing-this
parallelism-that gives the Web its power. Like humans, the Web is new, although
its roots are not. And its impact is barely two years old.

<P>This correspondence between biology and technology is striking. And naturally,
it's not perfect. Why should it be? This is fun, after all-more whimsy than
science. But if we accept this correspondence, crude as it is, it tells us that
technology is evolving at roughly 10 million times the speed of natural
evolution. Hurricane speed. Warp speed.

<P>From what I've said, it would seem that all the interesting things in
technology or biology have occurred recently. But this is just appearance. In
biological evolution, it is not the species markers that count but rather the new
principles that are "discovered" at rare intervals. The miracles are not
dinosaurs or mammals or humans but are the "inventions" of nucleotide-protein
coding, cellular compartmentation, multicelled organisms with differentiated
cells, networks of on-off regulatory genes. So it is with technology. The
miracles are not computers or the Net; they are the original ideas that human
reckoning can be rendered into movements of cogs and sprockets, that sequences of
instructions can be used to weave silk patterns, that networks of electrical
on-off switches can be used to pinpoint the zeroes of the Riemann zeta function.
The miracles are these new principles, and they arrive infrequently. Evolution
merely kludges them together to make new species or new machines in continually
novel ways.

<P>If technology is indeed evolving at something like 10 million times biology's
rate, perhaps this is too fast. Perhaps we are careening into the future in a
bobsled with no controls. Or being rocketed into orbit with no reentry possible.
This is frightening, maybe. Until we realize that we use all the complicated,
sleek, metallic, interwired, souped-up gizmos at our disposal for simple, primate
social purposes. We use jet planes to come home to our loved ones at
Thanksgiving. We use the Net to hang out with others in chat rooms and to
exchange e-mail. We use quadraphonic-sound movies to tell ourselves stories in
the dark about other people's lives. We use high-tech sports cars to preen, and
attract mates. For all its glitz and swagger, technology, and the whole
interactive revved-up economy that goes with it, is merely an outer casing for
our inner selves. And these inner selves, these primate souls of ours with their
ancient social ways, change slowly. Or not at all.

<P>My grandfather died in 1968, the year before human beings landed on the moon.
He never did realize his ambition to fly in an airplane. At 90, they told him he
was too old. The world of his childhood no longer exists. It has all changed. Our
world is changing, too, and rapidly. And yet nothing really is changing. For some
of us at least, even lovers of technology like me, this is a comfort.

The use of animals for research and testing is only one of many investigative techniques available. We believe that although animal experiments are sometimes intellectually seductive, they are poorly suited to addressing the urgent health problems of our era, such as heart disease, cancer, stroke, AIDS and birth defects. Even worse, animal experiments can mislead researchers or even contribute to illnesses or deaths by failing to predict the toxic effects of drugs. Fortunately, other, more reliable methods that represent a far better investment of research funds can be employed.
<P>
The process of scientific discovery often begins with unexpected observations that force researchers to reconsider existing theories and to conceive hypotheses that better explain their findings. Many of the apparent anomalies seen in animal experiments, however, merely reflect the unique biology of the species being studied, the unnatural means by which the disease was induced or the stressful environment of the laboratory. Such irregularities are irrelevant to human pathology, and testing hypotheses derived from these observations wastes considerable time and money.
<P>
The majority of animals in laboratories are used as so-called animal models: through genetic manipulation, surgical intervention or injection of foreign substances, researchers produce ailments in these animals that "model" human conditions. This research paradigm is fraught with difficulties, however. Evolutionary pressures have resulted in innumerable subtle, but significant, differences between species. Each species has multiple systems of organs--the cardiovascular and nervous systems, for example--that have complex interactions with one another. A stimulus applied to one particular organ system perturbs the animal's overall physiological functioning in myriad ways that often cannot be predicted or fully understood. Such uncertainty severely undermines the extrapolation of animal data to other species, including humans.
<P>
<B><A NAME="1">Animal Tests Are Inapplicable</A></B>
<P>
Important medical advances have been delayed because of misleading results derived from animal experiments. <a href="http://www.mayo.edu/mgs/faculty/wiebers.htm">David Wiebers</a> and his colleagues at the <a href="http://www.mayo.edu/">Mayo Clinic</a>, writing in the journal "Stroke" in 1990, described a study showing that of the 25 compounds that reduced damage from ischemic stroke (caused by lack of blood flow to the brain) in rodents, cats and other animals, none proved efficacious in human trials. The researchers attributed the disappointing results to disparities between how strokes naturally occur in humans and how they were experimentally triggered in the animals. For instance, a healthy animal that experiences a sudden stroke does not undergo the slowly progressive arterial damage that usually plays a crucial role in human strokes.
<P>
During the 1920s and 1930s, studies on monkeys led to gross misconceptions that delayed the fight against poliomyelitis. These experiments indicated that the poliovirus infects mainly the nervous system; scientists later learned this was because the viral strains they had administered through the nose had artificially developed an affinity for brain tissue. The erroneous conclusion, which contradicted previous human studies demonstrating that the gastrointestinal system was the primary route of infection, resulted in misdirected preventive measures and delayed the development of a vaccine. Research with human cell cultures in 1949 first showed that the virus could be cultivated on nonneural tissues taken from the intestine and limbs. Yet in the early 1950s, cell cultures from monkeys rather than humans were used for vaccine production; as a result, millions of people were exposed to potentially harmful monkey viruses.
<P>
In a striking illustration of the inadequacy of animal research, scientists in the 1960s deduced from numerous animal experiments that inhaled tobacco smoke did not cause lung cancer (tar from the smoke painted on the skin of rodents did cause tumors to develop, but these results were deemed less relevant than the inhalation studies). For many years afterward, the tobacco lobby was able to use these studies to delay government warnings and to discourage physicians from intervening in their patients' smoking habits.
<P>
Of course, human population studies provided inescapable evidence of the <a href="http://www.cancer.org/tobacco.html">tobacco-cancer connection</a>, and recent human DNA studies have identified tobacco's "smoking gun," showing how a derivative of the carcinogen <a href="http://atsdr1.atsdr.cdc.gov:8080/ToxProfiles/phs8805.html">benzo(a)pyren</a>e targets human genes, causing cancer. (It turns out that cancer research is especially sensitive to differences in physiology between humans and other animals. Many animals, particularly rats and mice, synthesize within their bodies approximately 100 times the recommended daily allowance for humans of vitamin C, which is believed to help the body ward off <a href="http://www.envirolink.org/arrs/peta/facts/exp/fsexp10.htm">cancer</a>.)
<P>
The stress of handling, confinement and isolation alters an animal's physiology and introduces yet another experimental variable that makes extrapolating results to humans even more difficult. Stress on animals in laboratories can increase susceptibility to infectious disease and certain tumors as well as influence levels of hormones and antibodies, which in turn can alter the functioning of various organs.
<P>
In addition to medical research, animals are also used in the laboratory to test the safety of drugs and other chemicals; again, these studies are confounded by the fact that tests on different species often provide conflicting results. For instance, in 1988 <a href="http://www.epp.cmu.edu/bios/lave.html">Lester Lave</a> of Carnegie Mellon University reported in the journal "Nature" that dual experiments to test the carcinogenicity of 214 compounds on both rats and mice agreed with each other only 70 percent of the time. The correlation between rodents and humans could only be lower. David Salsburg of <a href="http://www.pfizer.com/">Pfizer Central Research</a> has noted that of 19 chemicals known to cause cancer in humans when ingested, only seven caused cancer in mice and rats using the standards set by the National Cancer Institute.
<P>
Indeed, many substances that appeared safe in animal studies and received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use in humans later proved dangerous to people. The drug <a href="http://www.med.umich.edu/anes/drug_profiles/milrinone.html">milrinone</a>, which raises cardiac output, increased survival of rats with artificially induced heart failure; humans with severe chronic heart failure taking this drug had a 30 percent increase in mortality. The antiviral drug <a href="http://www.catie.ca/champ/drg-0098.htm">fialuridine</a> seemed safe in animal trials yet caused liver failure in seven of 15 humans taking the drug (five of these patients died as a result of the medication, and the other two received liver transplants). The commonly used painkiller zomepirac sodium was popular in the early 1980s, but after it was implicated in 14 deaths and hundreds of life-threatening allergic reactions, it was withdrawn from the market. The antidepressant nomifensine, which had minimal toxicity in rats, rabbits, dogs and monkeys, caused liver toxicity and anemia in humans--rare yet severe, and sometimes fatal, effects that forced the manufacturer to withdraw the product a few months after its introduction in 1985.
<P>
These frightening mistakes are not mere anecdotes. The U.S. General Accounting Office reviewed 198 of the 209 new drugs marketed between 1976 and 1985 and found that 52 percent had "serious postapproval risks" not predicted by animal tests or limited human trials. These risks were defined as adverse reactions that could lead to hospitalization, disability or death. As a result, these drugs had to be relabeled with new warnings or withdrawn from the market. And of course, it is impossible to estimate how many potentially useful drugs may have been needlessly abandoned because animal tests falsely suggested inefficacy or toxicity.
<P>
<B><A NAME="2">Better Methods</A></B>
<P>
Researchers have better methods at their disposal. These techniques include epidemiological studies, clinical intervention trials, astute clinical observation aided by laboratory testing, human tissue and cell cultures, autopsy studies, endoscopic examination and biopsy, as well as new imaging methods. And the emerging science of <a href="http://www.pitt.edu/~kkr/task.html">molecular epidemiology</a>, which relates genetic, metabolic and biochemical factors with epidemiological data on disease incidence, offers significant promise for identifying the causes of human disease.
<P>
Consider the success of research on atherosclerotic heart disease. Initial epidemiological investigations in humans--notably the <a href="http://www.amhrt.org/hs96/framingham.html">Framingham Heart Study</a>, started in 1948--revealed the risk factors for heart disease, including high cholesterol levels, smoking and high blood pressure. Researchers then altered these factors in controlled human trials, such as the multicenter Lipid Research Clinics Trial, carried out in the 1970s and 1980s. These studies illustrated, among many other things, that every 1 percent drop in serum cholesterol levels led to at least a 2 percent drop in risk for heart disease. Autopsy results and chemical studies added further links between risk factors and disease, indicating that people consuming high-fat diets acquire arterial changes early in life. And studies of heart disease patients indicated that eating a low-fat <a href="http://www.amhrt.org/hs96/vegdiet.html">vegetarian diet</a>, getting regular mild exercise, quitting smoking and managing stress can reverse atherosclerotic blockages.
<P>
Similarly, human population studies of HIV infection elucidated how the virus was transmitted and guided intervention programs. In vitro studies using human cells and serum allowed researchers to identify the AIDS virus and determine how it causes disease. Investigators also used in vitro studies to assess the efficacy and safety of important new AIDS drugs such as AZT, 3TC and protease inhibitors. New leads, such as possible genetic and environmental factors that contribute to the disease or provide resistance to it, are also emerging from human studies.
<P>
Many animals have certainly been used in AIDS research, but without much in the way of tangible results. For instance, the widely reported monkey studies using the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) under unnatural conditions suggested that oral sex presented a transmission risk. Yet this study did not help elucidate whether oral sex transmitted HIV in humans or not. In other cases, data from animal studies have merely repeated information already established by other experiments. In 1993 and 1994 Gerard J. Nuovo and his colleagues at the State University of New York at Stony Brook determined the route of HIV into the female body (the virus passes through cells in the cervix and then to nearby lymph nodes) using studies of human cervical and lymph node samples. Later, experimenters at New York University placed SIV into the vaginas of rhesus monkeys, then killed the animals and dissected the organs; their paper, published in 1996, arrived at essentially the same conclusion about the virus's path as did the previous human studies.
<P>
Research into the causes of birth defects has relied heavily on animal experiments, but these have typically proved to be embarrassingly poor predictors of what can happen in humans. The rates for most birth defects are rising steadily. Epidemiological studies are needed to trace possible genetic and environmental factors associated with birth defects, just as population studies linked lung cancer to smoking and heart disease to cholesterol. Such surveys have already provided some vital information--the connection between neural tube defects and <a href="http://www.familyinternet.com/peds/top/000354.htm">folate deficiency</a> and the identification of <a href="http://www.oise.on.ca/~skalynlangford/fas.html">fetal alcohol syndrome</a> are notable findings--but much more human population research is needed.
<P>
Observations of humans have proved to be invaluable in cancer research as well. Several studies have shown that cancer patients who follow diets low in fat and rich in vegetables and fruit live longer and have a lower risk of recurrence. We now need intervention trials to test which specific diets help with various types of cancers.
<P>
The issue of what role, if any, animal experimentation played in past discoveries is not relevant to what is necessary now for research and safety testing. Before scientists developed the cell and tissue cultures common today, animals were routinely used to harbor infectious organisms. But there are few diseases for which this is still the case--modern methods for vaccine production are safer and more efficient. Animal toxicity tests to determine the potency of drugs such as digitalis and insulin have largely been replaced with sophisticated laboratory tests that do not involve animals.
<P>
<B><A NAME="3">A Rhetorical Device</A></B>
<P>
Animal "models" are, at best, analogous to human conditions, but no theory can be proved or refuted by analogy. Thus, it makes no logical sense to test a theory about humans using animals. Nevertheless, when scientists debate the validity of competing theories in medicine and biology, they often cite animal studies as evidence. In this context, animal experiments serve primarily as rhetorical devices. And by using different kinds of animals in different protocols, experimenters can find evidence in support of virtually any theory. For instance, researchers have used animal experiments to show that cigarettes both do and do not cause cancer.
<P>
<a href="http://www.fcs.uga.edu/~mhulsey/Harlow.html">Harry Harlow's famous monkey experiments</a>, conducted in the 1960s at the University of Wisconsin, involved separating infant monkeys from their mothers and keeping some of them in total isolation for a year. The experiments, which left the animals severely damaged emotionally, served primarily as graphic illustrations of the need for maternal contact--a fact already well established from observations of human infants.
<P>
Animal experimenters often defend their work with brief historical accounts of the supposedly pivotal role of animal data in past advances. Such interpretations are easily skewed. For example, proponents of animal use often point to the significance of animals to diabetes research. But human studies by Thomas Cawley, Richard Bright and Appollinaire Bouchardat in the 18th and 19th centuries first revealed the importance of pancreatic damage in <a href="http://www.diabetes.ca/cda/75th/diabetes.htm">diabetes</a>. In addition, human studies by Paul Langerhans in 1869 led to the discovery of insulin-producing islet cells. And although cows and pigs were once the primary sources for insulin to treat diabetes, human insulin is now the standard therapy, revolutionizing how patients manage the disease.
<P>
Animal experimenters have also asserted that animal tests could have predicted the birth defects caused by the drug thalidomide. Yet most animal species used in laboratories do not develop the kind of limb defects seen in humans after thalidomide exposure; only rabbits and some primates do. In nearly all animal birth-defect tests, scientists are left scratching their heads as to whether humans are more like the animals who develop birth defects or like those who do not.
<P>
In this discussion, we have not broached the ethical objections to animal experimentation. These are critically important issues. In the past few decades, scientists have come to a new appreciation of the tremendous complexity of animals' lives, including their ability to communicate, their social structures and emotional repertoires. But pragmatic issues alone should encourage scientists and governments to put research money elsewhere.

<TD VALIGN="top" WIDTH="336">

<BR>
Experiments using animals have played a crucial role in the development of modern medical treatments, and they will continue to be necessary as researchers seek to alleviate existing ailments and respond to the emergence of new disease. As any medical scientist will readily state, research with animals is but one of several complementary approaches. Some questions, however, can be answered only by animal research. We intend to show exactly where we regard animal research to have been essential in the past and to point to where we think it will be vital in the future. To detail all the progress that relied on animal experimentation would require many times the amount of space allotted to us. Indeed, we cannot think of an area of medical research that does not owe many of its most important advances to animal experiments.
<P>
In the mid-19th century, most debilitating diseases resulted from bacterial or viral infections, but at the time, most physicians considered these ailments to be caused by internal derangements of the body. The proof that such diseases did in fact derive from external microorganisms originated with work done by the French chemist <a href="http://www.pasteur.fr/Pasteur/WLP.html">Louis Pasteur</a> and his contemporaries, who studied infectious diseases in domestic animals. Because of his knowledge of how contaminants caused wine and beer to spoil, Pasteur became convinced that microorganisms were also responsible for diseases such as chicken cholera and anthrax.
<P>
To test his hypothesis, Pasteur examined the contents of the guts of chickens suffering from cholera; he isolated a possible causative microbe and then grew the organism in culture. Samples of the culture given to healthy chickens and rabbits produced cholera, thus proving that Pasteur had correctly identified the offending organism. By chance, he noticed that after a time, cultures of the microorganisms lost their ability to infect. But birds given the ineffective cultures became resistant to fresh batches that were otherwise lethal to untreated birds. Physicians had previously observed that among people who survived a severe attack of certain diseases, recurrence of the disease was rare; Pasteur had found a means of producing this resistance without risk of disease. This experience suggested to him that with the administration of a weakened culture of the disease-causing bacteria, doctors might be able to induce in their patients immunity to infectious diseases.
<P>
In similar studies on rabbits and guinea pigs, Pasteur isolated the microbe that causes anthrax and then developed a vaccine against the deadly disease. With the information from animal experiments--obviously of an extent that could never have been carried out on humans--he proved not only that infectious diseases could be produced by microorganisms but also that immunization could protect against these diseases.
<P>
Pasteur's findings had a widespread effect. For example, they influenced the views of the prominent British surgeon <a href="http://vh.radiology.uiowa.edu/Providers/Textbooks/SnyderMedHx/168Lister.html">Joseph Lister</a>, who pioneered the use of carbolic acid to sterilize surgical instruments, sutures and wound dressings, thereby preventing infection of wounds. In 1875 Queen Victoria asked Lister to address the Royal Commission inquiry into vivisection--as the queen put it, "to make some statement in condemnation of these horrible practices." As a Quaker, Lister had spoken publicly against many cruelties of Victorian society, but despite the request of his sovereign, he was unable to condemn vivisection. His testimony to the Royal Commission stated that animal experiments had been essential to his own work on asepsis and that to restrict research with animals would prevent discoveries that would benefit humankind.
<P>
<A NAME="1"><B>Dozens of Vaccines and Antibiotics</B></A>
<P>
Following the work of Pasteur and others, scientists have established causes of and vaccines for dozens of infectious diseases, including diphtheria, tetanus, rabies, whooping cough, tuberculosis, poliomyelitis, measles, mumps and rubella. The investigation of these ailments indisputably <a href="http://www.fbresearch.org/nobels.htm">relied heavily on animal experimentation</a>: in most cases, researchers identified candidate microorganisms and then administered the microbes to animals to see if they contracted the illness in question.
<P>
Similar work continues to this day. Just recently, scientists developed <a href="http://www.os.dhhs.gov/news/press/1996pres/960925.html">a vaccine against Hemophilus influenzae type B</a> (Hib), a major cause of meningitis, which before 1993 resulted in death or severe brain damage in more than 800 children each year in the U.S. Early versions of a vaccine produced only poor, short-lived immunity. But a new vaccine, prepared and tested in rabbits and mice, proved to be powerfully immunogenic and is now in routine use. Within two months of the vaccine's introduction in the U.S. and the U.K., Hib infections fell by 70 percent.
<P>
Animal research not only produced new vaccines for the treatment of infectious disease, it also led to the development of antibacterial and antibiotic drugs. In 1935, despite aseptic precautions, trivial wounds could lead to serious infections that resulted in amputation or death. At the same time, in both Europe and the U.S., death from puerperal sepsis (a disease that mothers can contract after childbirth, usually as a result of infection by hemolytic streptococci) occurred in 200 of every 100,000 births. In addition, 60 of every 100,000 men aged 45 to 64 died from lobar pneumonia. When sulfonamide drugs became available, these figures fell dramatically: by 1960 only five out of every 100,000 mothers contracted puerperal sepsis, and only six of every 100,000 middle-aged men succumbed to lobar pneumonia. A range of other infections could also be treated with these drugs.
<P>
The story behind the introduction of sulfonamide drugs is instructive. The team investigating these compounds--<a href="http://medweb.uni-muenster.de/institute/anat/English/gerhar_e.htm">Gerhard Domagk</a>'s group at Bayer Laboratories in Wuppertal-Elberfeld, Germany--insisted that all candidate compounds be screened in infected mice (using the so-called mouse protection test) rather than against bacteria grown on agar plates. Domagk's perspicacity was fortunate: the compound prontosil, for instance, proved to be extremely potent in mice, but it had no effect on bacteria in vitro--the active antibacterial substance, sulfanilamide, was formed from prontosil within the body. Scientists synthesized other, even more powerful sulfonamide drugs and used them successfully against many infections. For his work on antibacterial drugs, Domagk won the Nobel Prize in 1939.
<P>
A lack of proper animal experimentation unfortunately delayed for a decade the use of the remarkable antibiotic <a href="http://www.iumsc.indiana.edu/educational/penicill/penicill.htm">penicillin</a>: <a href="http://www.cshl.org/comfort/scientists/fleming.html">Alexander Fleming</a>, working in 1929, did not use mice to examine the efficacy of his cultures containing crude penicillin (although he did show the cultures had no toxic effects on mice and rabbits). In 1940, however, Howard W. Florey, Ernst B. Chain and others at the University of Oxford finally showed penicillin to be dramatically effective as an antibiotic via the mouse protection test.
<P>
Despite the success of vaccines and antibacterial therapy, <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/publications/eid_plan/summary.htm">infectious disease</a> remains the greatest threat to human life worldwide. There is no effective vaccine against malaria or AIDS; physicians increasingly face strains of bacteria resistant to current antibacterial drugs; new infectious diseases continue to emerge. It is hard to envisage how new and better vaccines and medicines against infectious disease can be developed without experiments involving animals.
<P>
Research on animals has been vital to numerous other areas in medicine. Open-heart surgery--which saves the lives of an estimated 440,000 people every year in the U.S. alone--is now routine, thanks to 20 years of animal research by scientists such as John Gibbon of <a href="http://jeffline.tju.edu/tjuweb/tju/index.html">Jefferson Medical College</a> in Philadelphia. Replacement heart valves also emerged from years of animal experimentation.
<P>
The development of treatments for kidney failure has relied on step-by-step improvement of techniques through animal experiments. Today <a href="http://www.uel.ac.uk/research/rds/advances/dialysis.html">kidney dialysis</a> and even kidney transplants can save the lives of patients suffering from renal failure as a result of a variety of ailments, including poisoning, severe hemorrhage, hypertension or diabetes. Roughly 200,000 people require dialysis every year in the U.S.; some 11,000 receive a new kidney. Notably, a drug essential for dialysis--heparin--must be extracted from animal tissues and tested for safety on anesthetized animals.
<P>
Transplantation of a kidney or any major organ presents a host of complications; animal research has been instrumental in generating solutions to these problems. Experiments on cats helped develop techniques for suturing blood vessels from the host to the donor organ so that the vessels would be strong enough to withstand arterial pressure. Investigators working with rabbits, rodents, dogs and monkeys have also determined ways to suppress the immune system to avoid rejection of the donor organ.
<P>
The list continues. Before the introduction of <a href="http://nova.uel.ac.uk/research/rds/advances/insulin.html">insulin</a>, patients with diabetes typically died from the disease. For more than 50 years, the lifesaving hormone had to be extracted from the pancreas of cattle or pigs; these batches of insulin also had to be tested for safety and efficacy on rabbits or mice.
<P>
When we started our scientific careers, the diagnosis of malignant hypertension carried with it a prognosis of death within a year, often preceded by devastating headaches and blindness. Research on anesthetized cats in the 1950s heralded an array of progressively improved <a href="http://lysine.pharm.utah.edu/netpharm/dl_hyp.htm">antihypertensive medicines</a>, so that today treatment of hypertension is effective and relatively benign. Similarly, gastric ulcers often necessitated surgery with a marked risk of morbidity afterward. Now antiulcer drugs, developed from tests in rats and dogs, can control the condition and may effect a cure if administered with antibiotics to eliminate Helicobacter pylori infection.
<P>
<A NAME="2"><B>Common Misconceptions</B></A>
<P>
Much is made in animal-rights propaganda of alleged differences between species in their physiology or responses to drugs that supposedly render animal experiments redundant or misleading. These claims can usually be refuted by proper examination of the literature. For instance, opponents of animal research frequently cite the drug thalidomide as an example of a medicine that was thoroughly tested on animals and showed its teratogenic effect only in humans. But <a href="http://www.uel.ac.uk/research/rds/armyths/sideff/thalidom.html">this is not so</a>. Scientists never tested thalidomide in pregnant animals until after fetal deformities were observed in humans. Once they ran these tests, researchers recognized that the drug did in fact cause fetal abnormalities in rabbits, mice, rats, hamsters and several species of monkey. Similarly, some people have claimed that penicillin would not have been used in patients had it first been administered to guinea pigs, because it is inordinately toxic to this species. Guinea pigs, however, <a href="http://nova.uel.ac.uk/research/rds/advances/penn.html">respond to penicillin</a> in exactly the same way as do the many patients who contract antibiotic-induced colitis when placed on long-term penicillin therapy. In both guinea pigs and humans, the cause of the colitis is infection with the bacterium Clostridium difficile.
<P>
In truth, there are no basic differences between the physiology of laboratory animals and humans. Both control their internal biochemistry by releasing endocrine hormones that are all essentially the same; both humans and laboratory animals send out similar chemical transmitters from nerve cells in the central and peripheral nervous systems, and both react in the same way to infection or tissue injury.
<P>
Animal models of disease are unjustly criticized by assertions that they are not identical to the conditions studied in humans. But they are not designed to be so; instead such models provide a means to study a particular procedure. Thus, cystic fibrosis in mice may not exactly mimic the human condition (which varies considerably among patients anyway), but it does provide a way to establish the optimal method of administering gene therapy to cure the disease. Opponents of animal experiments also allege that most illness can be avoided by a change of lifestyle; for example, adoption of a vegan diet that avoids all animal products. Whereas we support the promulgation of healthy practices, we do not consider that our examples could be prevented by such measures.
<P>
<A NAME="3"><B>A Black Hole</B></A>
<P>
Our opponents in this debate claim that even if animal experiments have played a part in the development of medical advances, this does not mean that they were essential. Had such techniques been outlawed, the argument goes, researchers would have been forced to be more creative and thus would have invented superior technologies. Others have suggested that there would not be a gaping black hole in place of animal research but instead more careful and respected clinical and cellular research.
<P>
In fact, there was a gaping black hole. No outstanding progress in the treatment of disease occurred until biomedical science was placed on a sound, empirical basis through experiments on animals. Early researchers, such as Pasteur and the 17th-century scientist <a href="http://www.gene.com/ae/AB/BC/William_Harvey.html">William Harvey</a>, who studied blood circulation in animals, were not drawn to animal experiments as an easy option. Indeed, they drew on all the techniques available at the time to answer their questions: sometimes dissection of a cadaver, sometimes observations of a patient, sometimes examination of bacteria in culture. At other times, though, they considered experimentation on animals to be necessary.
<P>
We would like to suggest an interesting exercise for those who hold the view that animal experiments, because of their irrelevance, have retarded progress: take an example of an advance dependent on animal experiments and detail how an alternative procedure could have provided the same material benefit. A suitable example would be treatment of the cardiac condition known as mitral valve insufficiency, caused by a defect in the heart's mitral valve. The production of prosthetic heart valves stemmed from years of development and testing for efficacy in dogs and calves. The artificial valve can be inserted only into a quiescent heart that has been bypassed by a heart-lung machine--an instrument that itself has been perfected after 20 years' experimentation in dogs. If, despite the benefit of 35 years of hindsight, critics of animal research cannot present a convincing scenario to show how effective treatment of mitral valve insufficiency could have developed any other way, their credibility is suspect.
<P>
Will animal experiments continue to be necessary to resolve extant medical problems? Transgenic animals with a single mutant gene have already provided a wealth of new information on the functions of proteins and their roles in disease; no doubt they will continue to do so. We also anticipate major progress in the treatment of traumatic injury to the central nervous system. The dogma that it is impossible to restore function to damaged nerve cells in the mammalian spinal cord has to be reassessed in the light of recent animal research indicating that <a href="http://www.sciam.com/0197issue/0197scicit1.html">nerve regeneration is indeed possible</a>. It is only a matter of time before treatments begin to work. We find it difficult to envision how progress in this field--and so many others in biological and medical science--can be achieved in the future without animal experiments.

<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=336>
There is no question about it: the number of animals used in laboratory experiments is going down. In the U.K., the Netherlands, Germany and several other European countries, the total has fallen by half since the 1970s. In Canada, mammals have largely been replaced by fish. The figures for the U.S. are unclear. The U.S. uses between 18 and 22 million animals a year, but exact numbers are unknown for roughly 85 percent of these--rats, mice and birds. Primate use has stayed constant, whereas the use of dogs and cats is down by half since the 1970s.
<P>
No one reason accounts for the decline, but several factors are obvious. In 1975 the animal-rights movement exploded onto the scene with the publication of Animal Liberation by the Australian philosopher <A HREF="http://www.arts.monash.edu.au/bioethics/staff.htm">Peter Singer</A>. The book's depiction of research, and a series of expos&#233;s by suddenly vigilant activists, threw a harsh spotlight on scientists. In the following years, public perceptions of animals became increasingly sympathetic. <A HREF="http://www.imagine.co.uk/dfgf/intro1.htm">Dian Fossey</A>, <a href="http://www.wic.org/bio/jgoodall.htm">Jane Goodall</a> and other <a href="http://www.vet.purdue.edu/vad/cae/ethology.htm">ethologists</a> related to an enthralled audience tales of love, sorrow, jealousy and deceit among primates. Although not so popular with scientists, such anthropomorphic views of animals fueled the passage of laws regulating experimentation.
<P>
And the <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/science/scripts/display/short/272/5267/1403.html">scientists have changed</a>. Those entering the biomedical profession in recent decades have imbibed at least some of the concerns of the movement, if not its ideals; many are willing to acknowledge the moral dilemmas of their craft. Some experiments that were applauded in the 1950s would not be done today, because they would be deemed to cause too much suffering. Oftentimes biotechnology is allowing test tubes to be substituted for animals. And a few researchers, cognizant that only their expertise can help reduce the need for animals, are avidly seeking alternatives. All these efforts are bearing fruit.
<P>
<B><A NAME="1">The Philosophers</A></B>
<P>
The underlying force behind these changes appears to be society's evolving views of animals. These perceptions owe a great deal to philosophy and to science--and very little to religion. <a href="http://thecity.sfsu.edu/~fred/bible/Gen/1.html#1:28">The Bible</a> is unequivocal about the position of animals in the natural order: God made man in his image and gave him dominion over all other creatures. And although <a href="http://www.geocities.com/RodeoDrive/1415/indexd.html">Hinduism</a> and <a href="http://www.inet.co.th/cyberclub/bow/overview_buddhism.html">Buddhism</a> envisage a hierarchy of organisms rather than a sharp division, their influence on the animal-rights movement is limited to vague inspiration and <a href="http://www.electriciti.com/~castcrew/vegetar.htm">vegetarian</a> recipes. The real roots lie in secular philosophy. In 1780 the English barrister <a href="http://www.nadn.navy.mil/EnglishDept/test/bentham.htm">Jeremy Bentham</a> asked what "insuperable line" prevented humans from extending moral regard to animals: "The question is not, Can they reason? nor, Can they talk? but, Can they suffer?"
<P>
The question became more poignant in 1859 with the advent of Charles Darwin's <a href="http://www.literature.org/Works/Charles-Darwin/origin/">theory of evolution</a>. The theory provided a scientific rationale for using animals to learn about humans, and Darwin endorsed such use. But he also believed in an emotional continuum between humans and animals and was troubled by the suffering that experimentation could cause. This dichotomy inspired clashes between animal lovers and experimenters in 19th-century England, culminating in the <a href="http://www.ctel.com.au/clients/rspca/history.htm">1876 British Cruelty to Animals Act</a> regulating animal experimentation. But the phenomenal success of medicine in the next century made the animal-protection movement recede into the background.
<P>
It rebounded in the 1970s, with Singer's attack. A philosopher in the utilitarian tradition of Bentham, <a href="http://cleo.murdoch.edu.au/~broad/singer.html">Singer holds</a> that in all decisions the total amount of good that results--human and animal--should be weighed against the suffering--human and animal--caused in the process. Not that to him the interests of humans and animals have equal weight: life is of far greater value to a human than, for example, to a creature with no self-awareness. But if there is something one would not do to, say, a severely incapacitated child, then neither should one do it to an animal that would suffer as much. Ignoring the interests of an animal just because it is not human is, to Singer, <a href="http://etsu.east-tenn-st.edu/~philos/faculty/hugh/species.html">"speciesism,"</a> a sin akin to racism. Invoking the connections between humans and the great apes, Singer, Goodall and others have issued a call for these creatures, at least, to be freed from experimentation.
<P>
Although Singer started the modern animal-rights movement, it takes its name and its most uncompromising ideas from <a href="http://envirolink.org/arrs/essays/case_for_ar.html">Tom Regan's</a> "The Case for Animal Rights" (University of California Press, 1983). Regan believes that all humans and most animals have inherent rights, which he describes as invisible "no trespassing" signs hung around their necks. They state that our bodies may not be transgressed, no matter how much good might thereby result. Regan does not equate humans with animals--to save survivors in a lifeboat, a dog could be thrown overboard before a human would--yet he states that animals cannot be experimented on, because they are not merely means to an end.
<P>
Many other philosophers have lent their voices to the animals, but few have come to the aid of researchers. One who did so, Michael A. Fox, author of "The Case for Animal Experimentation" (University of California Press, 1986), later declared himself convinced by his critics and became an advocate for animals. Attempts to refute Singer and Regan usually involve pointing to morally relevant criteria that separate humans from animals. <a href="http://www.bgsu.edu/departments/phil/faculty/frey/frey.html">Raymond G. Frey</a> of Bowling Green State University has written that animals cannot have interests, because they cannot have desires, because they cannot have beliefs, because they do not have language. Regan counters that a dog may well believe "that bone is tasty" without being able to formulate the phrase and that a human infant would never learn to speak unless it could acquire preverbal concepts to which it could later assign words, such as "ball."
<P>
Another supporter of research, Carl Cohen of the <a href="http://www.umich.edu/">University of Michigan</a>, has argued that rights are not inherent: they arise from implicit contracts among members of society, and they imply duties. Because animals cannot reciprocate such duties, they cannot have rights. This argument meets with the retort that infants and the mentally ill cannot fulfill such obligations either but are not left out of the realm of rights: Why omit animals? (One response is that human rights are based on characteristics of "typical" humans, not on borderline cases, prompting animal advocates to ask what these special qualities are--and so on and on.)
<P>
Some research proponents also note that nature is cruel: lions kill zebras, cats play with mice. <a href="http://earth.ics.uci.edu:8080/faqs/faq%2Dintro%2Dto%2Dbiology.html">Evolution</a> has placed humans on top, so it is only natural for us to use other creatures. This argument, which some say elevates <a href="http://laf.cioe.com/~jheinze/spencer.html">"survival of the fittest"</a> to a moral philosophy, falls prey to a proposition called the naturalistic fallacy. To paraphrase the 18th-century philosopher <a href="http://www.geocities.com/Athens/3067/hume.html">David Hume</a>, what "is" cannot dictate what "ought to be." So natural history may well illuminate why human morals evolved into their present form, but humans can transcend their nature. One animal advocate declares: "Killing and eating [meat] is an integral part of the evolution of human beings. Not killing and not eating [meat] is the next step in our evolution."
<P>
Many philosophers fall into the troubled middle, arguing for interests or rights to be ordered in a hierarchy that allows some uses of animals but bars others. Such distillations of animal-liberation ideas have been finding their way into legislation. The U.K., Australia, Germany and several other nations require a utilitarian cost-benefit analysis to be performed before an animal experiment can proceed. And in November 1996 the Netherlands passed into law the statement that animals have "intrinsic value": they are sentient beings, entitled to the moral concern of humans.
<P>
<B><A NAME="2">The Public</A></B>
<P>
Not that, of course, all the Dutch are vegetarians. Rational argumentation may have influenced public opinion, but as Harold A. Herzog, Jr., a psychologist at <a href="http://152.30.12.86/Psychology/psyhome.html">Western Carolina University</a>, remarks, the average person's stance on animal issues remains wildly inconsistent. In one survey, questions phrased in terms of rats yielded a far more provivisection outcome than those mentioning dogs. Jesse L. Owens, a neuroscientist at the University of Alaska, protests that medical research is "the only use of animals that is essential" and like other researchers is bewildered by people who eat meat and in the same gulp condemn experimentation.
<P>
Not surprisingly, the animal-liberation movement has coincided with society's becoming increasingly distant from farms--and shielded from the reality behind dinner. Those who grew up on farms often see animals as objects to be used, whereas those who had pets tend to express more sympathy. One line along which attitudes divide is gender. In all countries surveyed, women are more pro-animal and antivivisectionist than men, and three quarters of American animal-rights activists are women. Also noticeable is a generation gap. Surveys by <a href="http://www.yale.edu/forestry/faculty/kellert.html">Stephen R. Kellert</a> of Yale University find that those who are older or less educated are more likely to see animals as resources, whereas those who are younger or more educated tend to view animals with compassion.
<P>
Public support of animal experimentation, though <a href="http://www.envirolink.org/arrs/psyeta/sa/sa2.2/pifer.html">higher in the U.S. than in Europe</a>, has been slowly declining. In 1985, 63 percent of American respondents agreed that "scientists should be allowed to do research that causes pain and injury to animals like dogs and chimpanzees IF it produces new information about human health problems"; in 1995, 53 percent agreed. Even in disciplines that have traditionally used animals, the trend is unmistakable. A survey by <a href="http://www.wesleyan.edu/course9697/faculty/250556.htm">Scott Plous</a> of Wesleyan University finds that psychologists with Ph.D.'s earned in the 1990s are half as likely to express strong support for animal research as those with Ph.D.'s from before 1970. (Part of this result comes from the increased presence of women, but there is a significant drop among men as well.)
<P>
Opposition to animal experimentation is often said to derive from antiscience sentiments, aggravated by poor public knowledge of science. But according to a 1994 survey led by Linda Pifer of the <a href="http://www.chias.org/">Chicago Academy of Sciences</a>, negative attitudes toward animal experimentation in the U.S. correlate only weakly with lack of knowledge about science. And in Belgium, France and Italy, for instance, greater scientific literacy is connected with an increased rejection of animal experimentation.
<P>
Sociologists agree that opposition to vivisection derives primarily from sympathy for animals. Almost all animal rightists are vegetarians; many are <a href="http://www.geocities.com/RainForest/4587/veganism.html">"vegans,"</a> eschewing milk, eggs, leather and other animal products. "My philosophy of living as softly on the earth as I can is my life," one activist told Herzog. In striving to cause the least suffering possible, these individuals labor under a heavy moral burden that sits lightly on the rest of us. Some activists have indulged in threatening researchers, breaking into laboratories or even arson. But the number of such illegal acts, listed by the U.S. Department of Justice, dropped from about 50 a year in 1987 to 11 in 1992. (More recent figures are unavailable but are believed to be small.)
<P>
Many animal experimenters are also animal lovers. Surveys by <a href="http://www.fordham.edu/psychology/faculty.html#TAKOOSHIAN">Harold Takooshian</a>, a sociologist at Fordham University, reveal that biomedical researchers have the same mixed feelings about animals and animal research as does the general public. (The groups that gave animals the lowest rating and vivisection the highest were farmers, hunters and the clergy.) Thomas M. Donnelly, a veterinarian at the Rockefeller University's animal center, also runs a shelter to which he takes cats that are no longer needed for research. Almost all the toxicologists and pharmacologists at a 1996 meeting on alternatives to animal experimentation had experience with using animals and were moved enough by it to seek substitutes. Scientists choose to use animals because they feel it is the only way to help humans. Donald Silver, who did cancer studies on mice at Sloan-Kettering Hospital in the 1970s, recounts that whenever he had doubts about his work, he had only to think about the terminally ill patients in the children's ward.
<P>
<B><A NAME="3">The Scientists</A></B>
<P>
Of course, scientists' perceptions of animals have evolved as well. In the early 20th century Darwinian worries about emotions were dispelled by the rise of <a href="http://www.biozentrum.uni-wuerzburg.de/genetics/behavior/learning/behaviorism.html">behaviorism</a>. Because thoughts cannot be measured, but behavior can, practitioners such as <a href="http://paradigm.soci.brocku.ca/~lward/BIOS/PAGES/MORGANCL.HTML"> C. Lloyd Morgan</a> and, later, <a href="http://education.indiana.edu/~cep/courses/p540/skinner.html">B. F. Skinner</a> sought to describe animals purely in terms of their responses to stimuli. Bernard Rollin, author of "The Unheeded Cry" (Oxford University Press, 1989), argues that at some point, the animal psyche went from being impossible to measure to being nonexistent. The test of a good theory, "Morgan's canon," required all actions to be interpreted in terms of the lowest psychological faculties possible. In practice, this meant that a rat would not be feeling pain even if its "writhes per minute" were being used to test the efficacy of an analgesic. Its neurochemistry was merely inducing a physiological reflex.
<P>
"We were taught as undergraduates not to think of animals as other than stimulus-response bundles," asserts Melanie Stiassney, an ichthyologist at the American Museum of Natural History. "The dogma is you can't credit them with feelings." In turn, it is often thought undesirable for a researcher to have feelings about the animal under study: emotions can impair professional judgment and also make it hard to perform certain procedures. <a href="http://www.dac.neu.edu/units/ceut/Arnie.html">Arnold Arluke</a>, a sociologist at Northeastern University who studied animal laboratories from 1985 to 1993, reports that some technicians were deeply disturbed when a playful dog or a roomful of mice had to be put down. Such distress was officially discouraged and therefore kept secret. But after being "burned" by the death of a favorite animal, laboratory workers learned to avoid emotional connections with the creatures.
<P>
The resulting dissociation, which is often likened to that of a surgeon from a patient, allows a researcher to function with a minimum of stress. But given the emotional separation, a scientist may not realize when an animal is in pain--especially if the very existence of pain is in doubt. Nowadays, many researchers are aware of dissociation and seek objective ways to detect distress. And animal pain has come into its own. At a 1996 meeting on the <a href="http://www2.nas.edu/ilarhome/240a.html">"Guide to the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals"</a>--a collection of guidelines that all researchers funded by the <a href="http://www.nih.gov:80/">National Institutes of Health</a> have to follow--veterinarian <a href="http://www.medadmin.uiowa.edu/deptment/pharmacology/fac/gebhart.htm">Gerald F. Gebhart</a> of the University of Iowa stated that the pain-sensing apparatus is the same throughout the vertebrate kingdom and offered this rule of thumb: "If it hurts you, it probably hurts the animal."
<P>
Increasingly, animal experimenters try to balance scientific imperatives with humaneness. Keith A. Reimann, a veterinarian at Harvard University's animal facility, does AIDS-related research in monkeys. He insists that a macaque be euthanized as soon as it becomes sick, even if additional information might be gained by following the course of the illness. Franz P. Gruber of the University of Konstanz in Germany, who serves on a board overseeing animal experimentation, says his committee does not allow "death as an end point"--studies in which the animal dies of the disease or procedure being studied. Instead the committee works with the researcher to define a stage at which the creature can be put out of its misery.
<P>
One area of concern to American veterinarians involves paralytic drugs. These agents immobilize an animal for surgery, for six or more hours at a time; anesthesia, however, may wear off in an hour or two. A few researchers are reportedly reluctant to administer additional anesthetics for fear that an overdose could kill the animal before the experiment is over, leading to a loss of data. But without such "topping up," the animal may become conscious during the operation and not be able to convey, by twitch or cry, that it is in agony. And some scientists object to using painkillers because they do not want to introduce a new variable into the experiment.
<P>
Compassionate feelings for animals also influence studies, although researchers rarely admit to such unscientific, if creditable, motivations. When asked about their choice of species subjects, for example, three neuroscientists--working on monkeys, rats and frogs, respectively--replied unhesitatingly that it was determined by the scientific question at hand. But later in the conversation, the frog experimenter confided that he, personally, could not work on "a furry animal," and the rat experimenter said he would not work with a cat or even with a rat in a more painful protocol.

<B><A NAME="4">The Three Rs</A></B>
<P>
Scientists' concern for animals first became visible professionally in the 1950s, when the behavioristic paradigm came under attack. British zoologist William M. S. Russell and microbiologist Rex L. Burch published "The Principles of Humane Experimental Technique" (Methuen, London, 1959), in which they put forth the "<a href="http://ehpnet1.niehs.nih.gov/docs/1996/104%288%29/zurlo.html">three Rs</a>." This principle sets out three goals for the conscientious researcher: replacement of animals by in vitro, or test-tube, methods; reduction of their numbers by means of statistical techniques; and refinement of the experiment so as to cause less suffering. Although they took some decades to catch on, the three Rs define the modern search for alternatives.
<P>
Starting in the 1960s, humane organizations and governments began to fund studies in alternative methods. European governments, especially, have invested considerable resources. For the past 15 years, Germany has been giving out about $6 million a year in research grants alone; the Netherlands spends $2 million a year (including overheads for its alternatives center). The <a href="http://www.ei.jrc.it/ecvam/">European Center for the Validation of Alternative Methods</a>, a body set up in 1992 by the European Commission, requires another $9 million annually. In the U.S., governmental interest has been comparatively low; the <a href="http://www.niehs.nih.gov/">National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences</a> (NIEHS) is now offering $1.5 million worth of grants a year, for three years. And industry provides the $1 million a year that the <a href="http://cwis.welch.jhu.edu/~caat/"> Center for Alternatives to Animal Testing</a> (CAAT) at Johns Hopkins University disburses in grants. (Although 15 federal agencies have recently formed the Interagency Coordinating Committee for Validation of Alternative Methods, this venture is as yet unfunded.)
<P>
All this effort has yielded a variety of means for reducing animal use. Statistical sophistry, for example, is allowing the classical <a href="http://chemlabs.uoregon.edu/Safety/toxicity.html">LD50</a> (or lethal dose 50 percent) test for acute toxicity to be eliminated. This test requires up to 200 rats, dogs or other animals to be force-fed different amounts of a substance, to determine the dose that will kill half a group. Although in vitro alternatives are still far away--because the mechanisms underlying toxicity are poorly understood--protocols currently accepted worldwide call for a tenth the number of animals. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, for example, asks for between three and 18 animals to be used: if the substance kills the first three, it need be tested no further.
<P>
Another unpleasant procedure is the LD80 test for vaccines. Experimental animals are vaccinated against a disease; they and a control group are then exposed to it. The vaccine passes only if at least 80 percent of the experimental group remains healthy and if 80 percent of the control group dies. Again using statistics, Coenraad Hendriksen of the National Institute of Public Health and the Environment in the Netherlands found a way of testing diphtheria and tetanus vaccines that requires simply checking the level of antibodies. Apart from greatly reducing the suffering, it uses half the number of animals.
<P>
"Data mining"--the sifting of mountains of information for relevant new findings--has also proved astonishingly helpful. Horst Spielmann of ZEBET, the German center for alternatives to animal testing, surveyed decades of industry data on pesticides and concluded that if mice and rats prove sensitive to a chemical, it does not have to be tested on dogs. Spielmann anticipates that 70 percent of the dog tests can be dispensed with. Klaus Cussler of the Paul Ehrlich Institute in Langen, Germany, reviewed data on the "abnormal safety test" for vaccines (called the "mouse and guinea pig safety test" in the U.S.), which involves vaccinating mice and guinea pigs and watching for untoward reactions. Their findings led to the test being dropped for vaccines checked in other standard ways. "It was so senseless," Cussler shakes his head.
<P>
In 1989, after observing that production of monoclonal antibodies in mice with tumors causes much suffering, ZEBET funded industry research into test-tube alternatives. Consequently, the antibodies, used in cancer therapy, are now rarely manufactured in mice in Europe (although mice remain the norm in the U.S.). Production of polio vaccines is another success story. In the 1970s the Netherlands used 5,000 monkeys a year; now kidney cell cultures from just 10 monkeys provide enough vaccine for everyone. Hormones or vaccines manufactured in cell cultures are also purer than those made in vivo (that is, in the animals themselves), so each batch need not be tested as before for safety and efficacy.
<P>
In 1993 the Department of Transportation became the first U.S. agency to accept in vitro tests, for skin corrosivity. The traditional test requires placing a substance on a rabbit's shaved back to see how far it eats in. The test's replacement uses reconstructed human skin or a biomembrane such as <a href="http://www.invitrointl.com/corrosit.htm">Corrositex</a>--testimony to the role played by venture capital in finding alternatives. Several cosmetics manufacturers have entirely eliminated animal testing: they rely on in-house substitutes or use ingredients that have been tested in the past.
<P>
As yet, most researchers in the basic sciences see little hope of replacing animals. They stick to reduction or refinement, such as using an animal lower on the phylogenetic tree. The next spate of cuts in animal use, Spielmann predicts, will come in the field of medical education, for which alternative teaching tools have been devised. British surgeons, in fact, have not trained on animals since the 1876 act banned such use; instead they practice on human cadavers and later assist experienced surgeons in actual operations. In the U.S., more than 40 of the 126 medical schools do not use animals in their regular curricula. The most significant change has been in mind-set. Since 1985 in the Netherlands, every scientist starting research on animals has been required to take a three-week course. They learn hands-on procedures, proper anesthesia, specifications of inbred strains and so on--as well as the three Rs. First the students design an animal experiment; then they are asked to find ways of answering the same question without animals. The resulting discussion and hunt for information induces a new way of thinking. "It gives them time for reflection," says Bert F. M. van Zutphen of Utrecht University, who pioneered the course. "It's of utmost importance. To know how far I can go for my own conscience."
<P>
<B><A NAME="5">The Laws</A></B>
<P>
Another source of change in scientists' attitudes has been legislation. In the U.S., laws tend to derive from isolated incidents. The <a href="http://netvet.wustl.edu/awa.htm">Animal Welfare Act of 1966</a>--the federal law regulating animal use--came into being because of Pepper, a Dalmatian believed by its owners to have been stolen and sold to a lab, and a "Life" magazine article depicting starving dogs in dealers' pens. Perhaps the most significant change came in 1985, in the wake of two exposes involving primates. In Silver Spring, Md., macaques belonging to Edward Taub of the Institute for Behavioral Research were found to be chewing on their limbs, to which the nerves had been cut. And in 1984 videotapes from the University of Pennsylvania Medical Center displayed laboratory personnel mocking baboons whose heads had been smashed in during experiments on head trauma. The outcry following these revelations allowed Senator Robert Dole of Kansas to bring an amendment to the act. It established <a href="http://netvet.wustl.edu/iacuc.htm">institutional animal care and use committees</a (IACUCs) at each facility using regulated animals and required laboratories to exercise dogs and to ensure the psychological well-being of primates.
<P>
The "well-being" clause can be considered an instance of the public's imposing a scientific paradigm on scientists. An inspector from the <a href="http://aphisweb.aphis.usda.gov/reac/">U.S. Department of Agriculture</a>, which administers the Animal Welfare Act, sought expert advice at that time on primate psychology. There was no such thing, he was told. Now, just 10 years later, primates have emotions. At the 1996 NIH meeting, Gebhart listed fear, anxiety, boredom, separation and isolation as conditions to which experimenters should attend in their subjects. And a few labs are even trying to enrich the lives of their rabbits.
<P>
The laws have generally had the effect of driving up the costs of animal research. Animal protectionists complain, however, that the Animal Welfare Act and its amendments invariably get diluted at the implementation stage. The act, for instance, refers to warm-blooded animals, but the regulations written by the USDA exclude rats, mice and birds. The agency says it does not have funds for inspecting the laboratories that use these creatures, which is true; animal welfarists, however, say the omission originally came from lobbying by the biomedical community. In 1990 humane organizations sued to have these animals included. Although they initially won, the suit was thrown out on appeal, on the grounds that animal protectionists have no legal standing: only those who are injured--that is, the rats, mice and birds--can bring a civil suit. Dale Schwindaman of the USDA has promised, however, to include these animals within the next five years.
<P>
Another controversy has to do with so-called performance standards. When writing regulations for the 1985 amendments, the USDA refrained, for example, from stating how many times a week the dogs had to be walked. Such specifics are referred to as engineering standards. Instead the agency allowed each facility to come up with its own plans for dog and primate well-being, the "performance" of which was to be evaluated. (Because these plans are kept in-house, and not with the USDA, the public cannot obtain them through the Freedom of Information Act.)
<P>
Researchers are enthusiastic about the flexibility of performance standards, whereas Martin L. Stephens of the <a href="http://www.hsus.org/index.html">Humane Society of the U.S.</a> calls them "euphemisms for no standards." USDA inspectors are divided. Some argue that the standards are vague and unenforceable. Among others, Harvey McKelvey of the USDA's northwestern region says they let him use his judgment: "If I see an animal is bored with its toy, I can write that it needs a new one. I couldn't do that with engineering standards." The new NIH guide also embraces performance standards.
<P>
The animal care committees have empowered those scientists who wish to cut down on wastage and improve conditions for animals. "If you have an institution with conscientious people, the IACUC system works fairly well," says Ralph A. Meyer of Carolinas Medical Center. Cathy Liss of the <a href="http://www.animalwelfare.com/">Animal Welfare Institute</a> in Washington, D.C., agrees that some committees do far better than the law. But there is concern about the remainder. In 1992 an audit of the USDA's enforcement activities by the Office of the Inspector General revealed that out of 26 institutions selected at random, 12 "were not adequately fulfilling their responsibilities under the act." Everyone agrees that enforcement is inadequate: at present, there are only 69 inspectors, who may not be able to visit each of the 1,300 regulated laboratories (and also animal dealers, transporters and exhibitors) every year.
<P>
As a result, the inspectors rely on whistle-blowers. "We need eyes out there," McKelvey explains. It might be an animal-rights activist who has infiltrated a laboratory: groups such as People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (<a href="http://www.envirolink.org/arrs/peta/">PETA</a>) prepare detailed case histories that they present to the USDA or the NIH. Or it might be a researcher or technician.
<P>
Still, the USDA can offer few reassurances to informants. A former member of the animal care committee at New York University Medical Center <a href="http://www.paws.org:80/activists/news/news220.htm">claims to have been fired</a> in August 1995 for protesting irregularities in N.Y.U.'s labs and cooperating with the USDA's investigations. The university states that his position became redundant. But the scientist, along with an administrator who was also dismissed, is suing N.Y.U., as well as the USDA--which, he says, failed to provide whistle-blower protection. (The agency did fine N.Y.U. $450,000 for assorted violations of the Animal Welfare Act.) Several USDA inspectors express frustration with their agency's provisions on informants. "We can't protect a whistle-blower," McKelvey says. "The regulation is weak." Unlike civil-discrimination suits, which require only a concatenation of circumstances, the USDA needs to prove that the person was fired because of having blown the whistle.
<P>
Also controversial are the statistics on pain and distress provided by the IACUCs to the USDA. They indicate that in 1995, 54 percent of the regulated animals had no pain or distress, 37 percent had distress alleviated by painkillers, and only 8.8 percent suffered unalleviated pain or distress. The data have been widely criticized for being unreliable, because the USDA does not specify how to classify pain. Andrew N. Rowan of the Tufts University <a href="http://www.vec.tufts.edu/vetadmissions/mspubpolicy.html#ToCAPP">Center for Animals and Public Policy</a> has noted that some rather painful procedures, such as toxicity testing or antibody production, are commonly placed in the nonpainful category. Although the USDA proposed a pain scale in 1987, it was withdrawn after objections by researchers.
<P>
There are difficulties with assessing animal distress. Nevertheless, many European nations, as well as Canada, Australia and New Zealand, have developed pain scales in which each procedure is assigned a grade. As a result, their reports are more informative. The Netherlands listed in 1995 that 54 percent of animals had minor discomfort, 26 percent had moderate discomfort, and 20 percent suffered severe discomfort.
<P>
A pain scale would make it easier for IACUCs to rate the suffering involved in different schemes for doing an experiment. At present, the committees are required to certify that the animal researcher has looked for alternatives and that the number of animals used is reasonable. Alan M. Goldberg of CAAT wishes that they would also evaluate the experimental design. "Right now, using method A, they check: Is it the right number of animals? They don't look at method B or C"--which could involve in vitro techniques. Nor--unlike committees in Germany, Australia and elsewhere--are they required to weigh the benefits of research against the suffering or to include representatives of animal-welfare organizations in the review process. (The IACUCs do have to include someone unaffiliated with the institution, but who fills that position is again a source of controversy.)
<P>
<B><A NAME="6">The Propaganda</A></B>
<P>
Change in the U.S. has been slow and painful. Notwithstanding some evolution of practices, the ferocity of the attacks by the most fervent animal rightists has led to a sense of moral outrage and an unwillingness to compromise--on both sides. Almost all activists insist that animal research is unnecessary; to them, investigators using animals are cruel and corrupt, consumed by a desire for ever more papers and grants. One antivivisection tract is entitled "Slaughter of the Innocent," and the cover of another features splashes of blood. To animal liberators, the killing of more than six billion animals a year, mostly for food, represents a holocaust, and Adolf Hitler's doctors are proof that experimenters can be inhumane.
<P>
Many animal researchers, in turn, think of animal rightists as being brainless "bunny huggers" at best and dangerous fanatics at worst. Leaflets published by the <a href="http://ama-assn.org/">American Medical Association</a> represent the animal-rights position as equating humans with animals; a quote from Ingrid Newkirk of PETA, "A rat is a pig is a dog is a boy," is offered as evidence. (Newkirk claims her statement was "When it comes to feeling pain, a rat is a pig is a dog is a boy.")
<P>
In an essay entitled "We Can't Sacrifice People for the Sake of Animal Life," Frederick K. Goodwin, former head of the <a href="http://www.nimh.nih.gov/">National Institute of Mental Health</a>, has argued that the issue of animal rights threatens public health. In this vein, research advocates sometimes portray proposals to control animal research as being attacks on human life. For instance, one organization advises this response to a query about experimentation on pound animals: "How would you feel if the one research project that may save your child's life was priced out of existence because pound animals were banned?" Some writers invoke Hitler as proof that animal advocates are antihuman: he was an animal lover who passed anticruelty laws in 1930s Germany.
<P>
Finding itself under moral--and sometimes physical--siege, the research community has often retreated behind electronic surveillance systems--and an ethical code that frequently denounces internal dissent as treason, "giving ammunition to the enemy." One scientist interviewed for this article said that if his criticisms became known, he would be fired. In 1991 two animal researchers, <a href="http://www.unm.edu:80/~psych/Faculty/gluck.html">John P. Gluck</a> and <a href="http://apsa.org/fellows/fellows96.htm#KUBACKI">Steven R. Kubacki</a> of the University of New Mexico, wrote a treatise deploring the lack of ethical introspection in their field. Gluck testifies that the article quickly changed his status from an insider to a distrusted outsider. Arluke's studies revealed an absence of discussion about ethics: in 33 of 35 laboratories, moral positions were defined institutionally. Newcomers were given to understand that senior scientists had answered all the difficult questions, leaving them little to worry about.
<P>
The insulation has made it difficult for changes in other branches of the life sciences--or from across the Atlantic--to filter in. Primatologists, for instance, have been discussing complex emotions in their subjects for decades. But many American experimenters still refuse to use the word "suffering," because it suggests an animal has awareness. Even the word "alternatives" is suspect; instead the NIH describes these as "adjuncts" or "complements" to animal research. Some researchers seem to regard the three Rs as an animal-rights conspiracy. Robert Burke of the NIH has stated: "To argue that we must refine our methods suggests that they are currently inadequate or unethical.... In my view, it is intellectually dishonest and hypocritical to continue to advocate the original three Rs as a goal for science policy. It is also, without question, dangerous to give our enemies such useful tools with which to pervert the scientific enterprise."
<P>
Of the 17 institutes included in the NIH, only the NIEHS has been active in researching alternatives. Following a directive by Congress, the NIH awarded about $2.5 million in earmarked grants between 1987 and 1989. But F. Barbara Orlans of the Kennedy Institute of Ethics at Georgetown University charges that the money did not constitute a special allocation for alternatives: 16 of the 17 grants went to studies that had traditionally been funded. (Like other public health agencies worldwide the NIH supports research into invertebrate, in vitro and computer models that are not billed as alternatives.)
<P>
In 1993 Congress directed the NIH to come up with a plan for implementing the three Rs. The resulting document, entitled "Plan for the Use of Animals in Research," is an overview of biomedical models, with some emphasis on nonmammalian systems. "The central message of the plan," explains Louis Sibal of the NIH, "is that scientists have to decide for themselves what the best method of solving their problem is." Whereas the European Union plans to cut animal use in half by the year 2000, a 1989 NIH report stated that animal use is not likely to decrease.
<P>
One arena in which the propaganda battles have been especially fierce is the classroom: both sides see dissection as the key to the next generation's sympathies. Animal advocates say dissection in schools is unnecessary and brutalizing and that the 5.7 million vertebrates (mostly wild <a href="http://george.lbl.gov/ITG.hm.pg.docs/dissect/dissect.html">frogs</a>, but also cats, fetal pigs, pigeons and perch) used every year are procured in inhumane ways. Research advocates fear that without dissection, instruction will be inadequate, and fewer students will be attracted to or equipped for the life sciences.
<P>
In 1989, when the <a href="http://www.nabt.org/index.html">National Association of Biology Teachers</a> (NABT) announced a new policy encouraging alternatives, it provoked a violent reaction. Barbara Bentley of the State University of New York at Stony Brook, for instance, denounced the monograph on implementing the policy as "an insidiously evil publication--evil because it is a barely disguised tract produced by animal rightists." An intense campaign followed, and in 1993 the NABT issued a new policy statement, warning teachers to "be aware of the limitations of alternatives." There is no high school dissection in most European countries.
<P>
"It is possible to be both pro research and pro reform," Orlans says. She and others in the troubled middle have a simple message: the impasse must end. Animal liberators need to accept that animal research is beneficial to humans. And animal researchers need to admit that if animals are close enough to humans that their bodies, brains and even psyches are good models for the human condition, then ethical dilemmas surely arise in using them. But the moral burden is not for scientists alone to bear. All of us who use modern medicine and modern consumer products need to acknowledge the debt we owe to our fellow creatures and support science in its quest to do better by the animals.

Some readers, on first seeing the topic of this forum, will think they smell a
rat, and not just the one pictured. Researchers may fear that <I>Scientific
American</I> is giving comfort to the enemy, the animal-rights protesters trying
to turn laboratories upside-down. Animal welfarists, on the other hand, may
assume our coverage will be a biased slam-dunk of their arguments. Neither of
those sets of expectations will be met here.

<P>The polarization of opinions on the experimental use of animals has often
discouraged a reasoned search for a middle ground. We have tried to present some
of those divergent views, as well as the efforts at compromise. Some of the ideas
expressed here are far from those of <I>Scientific American</I>'s editors, but we
are presenting them because one function of this magazine is to be a dais for
debate on scientific topics.

<P>The interactivity of the Web allows us to open up the discussion to our
readers as well, and to air their reactions to the arguments mustered on all
sides. We invite you to send us your thoughts via the email link given below; we
will try to post as many of the responses as seems reasonable.

<P>To get the debate going, I would like to offer my personal opinion: I think
that the arguments for banning experiments on animals--those holding that there
are empirically and morally superior alternatives to such experimentation--are
unpersuasive. Even some of the moral philosophies favoring reduced use of animals
offer little in the way of real guidance, in my opinion. Utilitarians, for
instance, ask that the suffering of animals be counterbalanced with good results.
But that principle is unmanageably subjective, and may even be prejudiced against
research realities. The short-term benefits of most experiments are virtually
nil, and the long-term benefits are incalculable.

<P>What humane limits should we impose on the exercise of our scientific
curiosity? Researchers around the world ask and answer that question for
themselves every day. Their answers may not be perfect but, in general, they are
neither ignorant nor willfully bad. Scientists should have the humility to
recognize, however, that outsiders have often forced them to reexamine questions
of animal welfare that they might not otherwise have considered. The debate on
animal rights, though frustrating and seemingly endless, may be constructive
after all.

<P>Tectonic plates creep silently past one another; glaciers flow sluggishly down mountains; ground level slowly rises and falls. The geologic forces that shape the surface of the earth usually act with such stealth that most people remain entirely unaware of them. But then the sudden break of a geologic fault or the explosive eruption of a volcano occurs in a populated area, and the devastation instantly makes thousands frighteningly aware that the solid earth is indeed prone to motion.

<P>To better understand and, perhaps, forecast such catastrophic events, scientists have labored to measure the ongoing bending and stretching of the earth's crust. For this task, they have employed instruments of many types, from simple surveyor levels to sophisticated electronic positioning equipment. With all such methods, a person must <a href="http://iridium.astro.ubc.ca/Glaciology/surfradar.html">travel to the site </a>that is to be evaluated to set up some sort of apparatus and make observations. Yet this commonsensical requirement, as it turns out, is not an absolute prerequisite.

<P>In 1985 I carried out a study--then an entirely theoretical exercise--that showed a way, without putting any equipment at all on the ground, to monitor the deformation caused by tectonic forces. At that time scientists had used satellites and aircraft for many years to construct <a href="http://iridium.astro.ubc.ca/Glaciology/radar.html">radar images of the land below</a>, and I envisioned that, with some additional tricks, these same devices could detect the subtle shifts that the surface of the earth undergoes. I immediately tried to convince geologists of the value of this endeavor, but most of the people I approached remained dubious. Measuring ground motion of only a few millimeters from hundreds of kilometers away in space seemed too miraculous to be feasible. Fortunately, I was able to persuade my employer, the <a href="http://www.cnes.fr/">French Space Agency</a>, to allow me to pursue this exciting prospect.

<P>It would take years of diligent work, but my research group, along with other investigators around the world, has succeeded in carrying out what seemed quite fantastic to most scientists just a dozen years ago. My colleagues and I have used a new technique, called satellite radar interferometry, to map geologic faults that have ruptured in earthquakes and to follow the heaving of volcanic mountains as molten rock accumulates and ebbs away beneath them. Other researchers have <a href="http://www.geo.cornell.edu/geology/eos/research/Interf_DEMs.html">harnessed radar interferometry</a> to survey remote landslides and the slow-motion <a href="http://www.geo.cornell.edu/geology/eos/research/rick.html">progress of glacial ice</a>. Former skeptics must now concede that, miraculous or not, radar satellites can indeed sense barely perceptible movements of the earth's surface from far away in space.

<P>Although the dramatic successes of satellite <a href="http://southport.jpl.nasa.gov/desc/imagingradarv3.html">radar interferometry</a> are quite recent, the first steps toward accomplishing such feats took place decades ago. Soon after <a href="http://members.tripod.com/~edradar/">radar</a> (shorthand for RAdio Detecting And Ranging) became widely used to track airplanes using large rotating dish antennas, scientists devised ways to form radar images of the land surface with small, fixed antennas carried aloft by aircraft [see "Side-Looking Airborne Radar," by Homer Jensen, L. C. Graham, Leonard J. Porcello and Emmett N. Leith; SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN, October 1977]. Even thick cloud cover does not obscure such images, because water droplets and ice crystals do not impede the radio signals. What is more, aircraft and orbiting satellites fitted with radar antennas can take these pictures equally well during the day or night, because the radar provides, in a sense, its own light source.

<P>But the distinction between radar imaging and conventional aerial photography is more profound than the ability of radar to operate in conditions that would cause optical instruments to falter. There are fundamental differences in the physical principles underlying the two approaches. Optical sensors record the amount of electromagnetic radiation beamed from the sun (as countless independent light waves, or photons) and reflected from the ground. Thus, each element of the resulting image--called a pixel--is characterized by the brightness, or amplitude, of the light detected. In contrast, a radar antenna illuminates its subject with "coherent" radiation: the crests and troughs of the electromagnetic wave emitted follow a regular sinusoidal pattern. Hence, radar instruments can measure both the amplitude and the exact point in the oscillation--called the phase--of the returned waves, whereas optical sensors merely record the quantity of reflected photons.

<P>A great benefit arises from measuring phase, because radar equipment operates at extremely high frequencies, which correspond to short radio wavelengths. If a satellite radar functions, for instance, at a frequency of six gigahertz (six billion cycles per second), the radio signal will travel earthward at the speed of light for only five centimeters during the tiny amount of time the wave takes to complete one oscillation. If the distance from the radar antenna to a target on the ground is, for example, exactly 800 kilometers, the 1,600-kilometer round-trip (for the radar signal to reach the earth and bounce back up) will correspond to a very large--but whole--number of wavelengths. So when the wave returns to the satellite, it will have just completed its final cycle, and its phase will be unchanged from its original condition at the time it left. If, however, the distance to the ground exceeds 800 kilometers by only one centimeter, the wave will have to cover an additional two centimeters in round-trip distance, which constitutes 40 percent of a wavelength. As a result, the phase of the reflected wave will be off by 40 percent of a cycle when it reaches the satellite, an amount the receiving equipment can readily register. Thus, the measurement of phase provides a way to gauge the distance to a target with centimeter, or even millimeter, precision.

<P>Yet for decades, most practitioners of radar imaging completely overlooked the value of phase measurements. That oversight is easy to understand. A single pixel in a radar image represents an appreciable area on the ground, perhaps 100 square meters. Such a patch will generate <a href="http://wwwspace.ffi.no/SpaceWeb/RSGroup/Vegetation_Analysis.html">multiple radar reflections</a> from the countless small targets contained within it--scattered pebbles, rocks, leaves, branches and other objects--or from rough spots on the surface. Because these many radar reflections will combine in unpredictable ways when they reach the antenna, the phase measured for a given pixel seems random. That is, it appears to have no relation to the phase measured for adjacent pixels in the radar image.

<P>The amplitude associated with a given pixel in such an image will, however, generally indicate whether many or few elementary reflectors were present at the corresponding place on the ground. But the amplitude measurements will also have a "noisy" aspect, because the individual reflections contributing to one pixel can add together and make the overall reflection stronger (constructive interference), or they can cancel one another out (destructive interference). This phenomenon in the reflection of coherent radiation--called <a href="http://op.ph.ic.ac.uk/speckle.html">speckle</a>--also accounts for the strange, grainy appearance of a spot of laser light.

<P>For many years, scientists routinely overcame the troubling effects of speckle by averaging the amplitudes of neighboring pixels in their radar images. They followed this strategy in an attempt to mimic the results of conventional black-and-white aerial photography, and to that end they were quite successful. Yet by averaging amplitudes, they lost all knowledge of the phase of the radar reflections, which unbeknownst to them contained much hidden information.

<P>But that state of affairs did not continue indefinitely. In 1974 L. C. Graham, working at Goodyear Aerospace, first demonstrated that it was possible to take advantage of the phase measured by an airborne radar. Then, in the early 1980s, scientists at the <a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/">Jet Propulsion Laboratory </a> in Pasadena, Calif., showed that they could extract similar results from the phase measured by <a href="http://leonardo.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/QuickLooks/seasatQL.html">SEASAT</a>, the first civilian radar satellite, which was launched in 1978 (but worked for only three months). They did so by comparing two radar images taken from roughly the same position but at different times. In a sense, that exercise was akin to taking two widely separated frames of time-lapse photography. Although the phase itself appeared random every time, the phase differences between corresponding pixels in the two radar images produced a relatively straightforward interference pattern.

<P>In principle, if two sequential satellite images are taken from exactly the same position, there should be no phase difference for any pair of corresponding pixels. But if the scene on the ground changes ever so slightly in the interim between the two radar scans, the phases of some pixels in the second image will shift. Radar satellites can thus track minute movements of the earth's surface.

<P>In the usual presentation, radar <a http://wwwspace.ffi.no/SpaceWeb/RSGroup/Svalbard_interferogram.htmlsea">"interferograms"</a> produced in this way show ground motion using a series of colored bands, which are meant to resemble the interference fringes produced from a thin film of soap or oil. One complete set of colored bands represents a shift of half a wavelength, because the radar wave must cover the round-trip distance back and forth. For the European satellite ERS-1, a set of fringes marks a change of just three centimeters in the amount of ground motion. Although these fringes record only the component of ground movement that is in the direction of the satellite (or directly away from it), they nonetheless prove extraordinarily useful, because a single radar view can span vast stretches of land that would take years for geologists and surveyors to map in similar detail.

<P>Radar interferometry does, however, require that the many small reflective objects contributing to each pixel--be they rocks or pockets of vegetation--remain unchanged (so that the random component of the phase is exactly the same for both images). This rather stringent condition creates some bothersome limitations. If the time elapsed between the acquisition of the two images is excessive, the small targets encompassed by each pixel will shift erratically. Leaves can fall off trees; clumps of grass might grow where there were none before; rainstorms may wash out ruts in the ground. Another, even more subtle, problem arises: if the two radar images are taken from different vantage points, the changing geometry will also introduce phase changes.

<P>Like a pair of stereoscopic aerial photographs, two radar images obtained from slightly different perspectives will contain differences that are caused by variations in the elevation of the land surface. Happily, one can remove such phase shifts by carefully calculating this purely topographic effect and subtracting it. But the radar phase will be mixed up beyond repair if the interference between elementary targets contributing to each pixel changes, as will inevitably occur unless the two images are taken from close to the same angle. Consequently, for successful interferometry, the two paths that the radar satellite follows in space cannot lie more than about one kilometer apart. (The exact value depends on the viewing geometry and the particulars of the radar satellite used.) The four radar satellites now in operation--the Canadian <a href="http://www.ccrs.nrcan.gc.ca/ccrs/radarsat/rsate.html">Radarsat</a>, the European<a href="http://gds.esrin.esa.it/CQuicklooks"> ERS-1 and ERS-2</a>, as well as the Japanese <a href="http://www.eoc.nasda.go.jp/guide/guide/satellite/satdata/jers_e.html">JERS-1</a>--usually comply with this requirement, although none was designed with interferometry in mind. Aircraft have a much more difficult time flying along the same path twice, a difficulty I did not fully appreciate when I first began working to prove the concept.

<P>Shortly after I proposed that radar interferometry could detect tectonic motion, my colleagues and I began experiments to demonstrate the idea using an airborne radar. Our progress was set back severely when the vintage B-17 flying fortress that usually carried our radar crashed on takeoff in 1989. Fortunately, the crew managed to escape before the retired bomber erupted into a fireball. But we had to start afresh. Rather than adapting our equipment to another aircraft, we attempted to demonstrate our scheme with an airborne radar provided by some German colleagues. Yet we missed our goal, because the aircraft was not able to fly sufficiently close to its previous path. A. Laurence Gray and his colleagues at the <a href="http://www.ccrs.nrcan.gc.ca/ccrs/homepg.pl?e">Canadian Center for Remote Sensing</a> accomplished this tour de force in 1991.

<P>The next year a major earthquake struck near the town of <a href="http://www.asf.alaska.edu/step/insar/abstracts/mass4.html">Landers</a> in southern California, and my colleagues and I realized that this desert locale might be an ideal place to test whether a satellite radar could measure the associated deformation of the earth's crust. So we assembled all the radar images of the area available from the ERS-1 satellite and formed several interferograms by combining one image taken before the earthquake with another one taken afterward from approximately the same position. Because the satellite tracks were never identical, the rugged relief in the region affected these interferograms markedly. Yet with the help of a digitized map of elevations, we were able to calculate the topographic contribution and remove it. Doing so unveiled a tantalizingly rich picture of interference fringes. But were these colored bands truly showing what the earthquake had done to the surface of <a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/sircxsar/irwin.html">California's Mojave Desert</a>?

<P>To test whether our representation of ground movement was indeed valid, we calculated an idealized interferogram based on measurements that geologists had made for the motion along the main fault. The model interferogram showed a striking resemblance to the radar pattern we found, and that match bolstered our confidence enormously. We were also pleased to see that in some places the fringe pattern revealed tiny offsets on other geologic faults known to be crisscrossing the area. In one case, we detected a mere seven millimeters of motion on a fault located 100 kilometers away from where the quake had struck.

<P>Soon after our study of the Landers earthquake, Richard M. Goldstein of the <a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/">JPL</a> and his co-workers used radar interferometry to track the movement of <a href="http://www.vexcel.com/tech_feat/radarsat.map.html">glacial ice in Antarctica</a>. They took advantage of an exceptional opportunity presented by the ERS-1 satellite when it passed within a few meters of the path it had followed six days previously. Because the satellite had taken "before" and "after" radar images from virtually the same position, the topography of the glacier did not influence the pattern of fringes, and the resulting picture directly indicated the motion of the ice. That image displayed movement of an ice stream (where flow is relatively rapid) in superb detail.

<P>Having shown its ability to track slipping faults and surging glaciers, radar interferometry had displayed great promise by 1993, and we wondered whether the technique could detect deformation that was even more subtle. So we next experimented with a set of radar images of the <a href="http://www.op.dlr.de/ne-hf/SRL-2/p45738_etna.html">Mount Etna</a> volcano in Sicily. That volcano had been nearing the end of an eruptive cycle during an 18-month period in 1992 and 1993 when the ERS-1 satellite passed over it 30 times. With those many radar images and an elevation map of the area, my colleagues and I were able to produce dozens of interferograms that were free from topographic effects. Some of our results were clearly degraded by changes in vegetation on the flanks of the volcano. (Certain pairs of images used in constructing these interferograms spanned many months; others encompassed more than a year.) Nevertheless, with the help of researchers at the Institute for the Physics of the Earth in Paris, we were able to follow the deflation of Mount Etna, as the last of the magma erupted and the pressure within the mountain declined. Our radar images showed that Mount Etna subsided by two centimeters each month during the final seven months of eruption. This deformation extended for a large distance around the volcano, suggesting that the subterranean magma chamber was much deeper than geologists had previously thought.

</TD> </TR> </TABLE>

<P>Although Mount Etna is located in one of the best surveyed parts of the world, radar interferometry uncovered surprising revelations (just as it had done by locating minute cracks in the Mojave Desert). The technique should prove even more valuable for studying the hundreds of other active volcanoes on earth that can be viewed using the existing radar satellites. Radar interferometry cannot replace conventional ground surveys, but at the very least it should serve to focus the attention of geologists toward slowly awakening volcanoes as they begin to inflate and become dangerous. This new form of remote sensing also offers a way to monitor volcanic peaks in otherwise inaccessible locales.

<P>As we probe more places, we have come to realize that short-lived variations in the atmosphere and ionosphere can sometimes alter the fringe pattern. Changes in soil properties, too, can induce the interference fringes to shift, even though the ground does not actually move. Such effects can complicate the interpretation of radar interferograms, and we have had to design some clever procedures to discriminate between them and true ground motion. But looked at more positively, these secondary influences represent features of the earth that are also of inherent interest--and it may prove a boon to some scientists that a radar satellite can map these features in great detail.

<P><B><A NAME="3">More Surprises to Come</A></B>

<P>What else is in store for radar interferometry? Forecasting specific advances is difficult, but one can safely predict that scientists will find plenty of opportunity to apply this technique all over the world. The four radar satellites currently in operation can scan most of the earth's surface, and Europe, Japan and Canada will soon launch others to add to the fleet of orbiting sensors. My colleagues and I have investigated possible future missions by studying the accuracy that a specially designed satellite could achieve in repeating its trajectory. Such an exact-repetition satellite would be the ideal platform for radar interferometry. The same satellite could also serve to measure surface elevation if its trajectory were purposely shifted in order to create the proper stereoscopic effect. (The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is, in fact, planning a space shuttle mission for the year 2000 to exploit this use of radar interferometry.) In this way, the overall topography of the entire planet could finally be obtained.

<P>Will radar interferometry be able to detect the precursory motions needed for scientists to predict earthquakes and volcanic eruptions? As of yet, no one can say for sure. But in scientific research every new tool brought to bear invariably uncovers crucial facts and deepens the understanding of fundamental principles. Radar interferometry will undoubtedly do the same for the study of the solid but ever restless earth.

<P>
As we celebrate the sesquicentennial this month of the birth of America's most renowned inventor, Thomas Alva Edison (1847-1931), our thoughts turn naturally to his "big three"--the electric lightbulb, the phonograph and the motion-picture camera. In fact, his creative energies were much more prolific: Edison obtained some 1,000 patents over six decades.
<P>
An essentially uneducated man, a dropout from the first grade, Edison's genius lay in hiring the best scientists and engineers to help fill the lacunae in his knowledge. His compulsive mind filled hundreds of laboratory notebooks with ideas to be enacted by this cadre of experienced co-workers.
<P>
Through Edison's lesser known endeavors, a selection enumerated in these pages, runs a strong, common thread--a pluralistic, Whitmanesque desire to do good things for the greatest number of Americans, to harness the technology of a nation emerging out of the industrial revolution into the modern era.
<P>
On the one hand, the electric pen, direct precursor of the mimeograph, was a successful step in communications; on the other, the Talking Doll, one of Edison's few genuine toys, something he sincerely wanted to produce for the delight of children, failed to catch hold because its delicate internal mechanism fell apart in shipping. During the 1890s, Edison invested at most $40,000 in glamorous research and development for the motion pictures, at the same time sinking uncounted millions into the iron-mining business.
<P>
Thomas Edison should be remembered for his incessant commitment to the underlying PROCESS of invention--he called it an art, never labor. He refused to recognize failure; he lived by the necessity to forge ahead, regardless of the ultimate practicality of any enterprise.
<P>
<a name="1847"></a><img src="IMG/1847.gif" alt="1847"><p>
Thomas Edison was born 150 years ago--on February 11, 1847, in a little room overlooking the new, much heralded interstate canal at Milan, Ohio. By age 15, intrepid "Little Al" Edison, a gleam already in his eye, was at work as a news butch, selling dime novels, newspapers, candy and sundries on the three-hour railroad commute between Port Huron, Mich., and Detroit.
<P>
<a name="1859"></a><img src="IMG/1859.gif" alt="1859"><p>
The Chicago, Detroit and Canada Grand Trunk Junction Railway (under construction in 1859), the first major north-south line in the Midwest, was Edison's first employer. When the three-year-old son of the stationmaster at Mount Clemens, Mich., wandered blithely out onto the tracks, Tom, without a moment's thought, darted into the path of an oncoming freight car and shoved Jimmie to safety. The child's grateful father offered to teach young Tom the intricate skills of telegraphy.
<P>
<a name="1876"></a><img src="IMG/1876.gif" alt="1876"><p>
By early 1876, Edison had established the first R&D facility in America at Menlo Park, in rural New Jersey. He would be ensconced here for the long haul, living and working with a handpicked team of "scientific men." The second floor of the main laboratory building was equipped with 2,500 bottles of chemicals lining the walls, as well as a massive pipe organ, the focal point for after-hours singing and beer drinking.
<P>

One of Edison's first creations to come out of Menlo Park was "An Improvement in Autographic Printing," or Electric Pen, a prototype for document reproduction. An early mechanical version cut stencils by hand, powering the incising needle with a spring. In the final invention, a portable galvanic battery drove an electromagnetic motor. Ink was then applied by roller over the punctured sheet, to create multiple impressions. Edison eventually sold the patent to A. B. Dick, pioneer of the mimeograph.
<P>
<a name="1890"></a><img src="IMG/1890.gif" alt="1890"><p>
But meanwhile Edison had embarked on the most consuming obsession of his career, a far cry from the safe confines of the laboratory. He purchased a 2,500-acre site in Sparta, in northwestern New Jersey, and set up a mining camp, where he would live in dust and grime for most of the next decade, determined to extract and refine magnetic iron from the Musconetcong Mountains. The Morgan Electric Overhead Traveling Crane picked up 10-ton-capacity railroad cars and tipped the raw ore onto giant crushing rolls. Edison's notebook plan illustrates how dried ore fragments less than 1/16 of an inch in diameter were dropped in a thin stream through a tower, past banks of electromagnetic sorters that pulled out the concentrated product.
<P>
In the hollow innards of the sadly short-lived Talking Doll, a miniature phonograph cylinder on a screw-threaded shaft connected to a crank protruding from the doll's back. There was just enough space on each cylinder for the first verse of "Mary Had a Little Lamb," "Jack and Jill" or "Little Bo Peep."
<P>
By the early 1890s, when this satirical charicature of "The Wizard of Menlo Park" appeared in "Harper's Weekly," Edison was popularly defined by his most renowned inventions--the phonograph, electric lightbulb, improved telephone receiver and cinematographic camera.
<P>
<a name="1901"></a><img src="IMG/1901.gif" alt="1901"><p>
In 1901 Edison vowed to create mass housing that would be within reach of every hardworking American family: the poured-concrete house. Designed to be produced in planned communities, it cost less than $1,200. The patent drawing illustrates that all the parts--including sides, roof, partitions, stairs, floors, dormers, even cupboards and ornamental ceilings--were formed from quartz-strengthened and clay-tempered cement poured into a cast-iron mold from the top downward, over a six-hour period. Ten days after the molds were removed and the cement fully hardened, only doors and windows remained to be added.
<P>
<a name="1910"></a><img src="IMG/1910.gif" alt="1910"><p>
Edison was prescient in his fear that "the seething mass" of machine-made industrial progress would generate ever greater environmental pollution. Despite the advances in internal combustion made by his old friend Henry Ford, Edison declared that "the future belong[ed] to the electric car." The 1910 S. R. Bailey Company model was powered by Edison's revamped storage battery: noncorroding plates of steel immersed in an aqueous electrolyte solution (rather than lead immersed in sulfuric acid), which could be charged quickly and cleanly.
<P>
<a name="1915"></a><img src="IMG/1915.gif" alt="1915"><p>
During World War I, Edison the patriot spent little time with his family at their Llewellyn Park estate near West Orange, N.J. (Edison had a daughter Madeleine, wife Mina and sons Theodore and Charles.) As chairman of the Naval Consulting Board, an inventors' think tank, Edison was most often to be found on board ships off the coasts of Annapolis, Long Island, and Key West, developing defensive "peace insurance" ideas, as he called them, "to protect our boys at sea" against dreaded submarines.
<P>
<a name="1929"></a><img src="IMG/1929.gif" alt="1929"><p>
Shocked to learn from the American horticulturist Luther Burbank that the U.S. depended on foreign markets for more than 75 percent of its domestic rubber consumption, Edison embarked over the final two decades of his life on a crusade to cultivate "milky sap"-bearing plants on native ground, converting his winter estate in Fort Myers, Fla., into a vast plantation. The sturdy Pterocaulon (misspelled by the inventor), a popular herb in the southeastern U.S., is a member of the Carduaceae (thistle) family. Edison found that its characteristic winged leaves contained slightly more than 2 percent natural rubber.
<P>
"I have not yet gone far enough to find out if my schemes [for producing rubber] are practicable," a 1929 journal entry reads in Edison's shaky hand. Past the time of the "Golden Jubilee" celebration of the first incandescent light, the octogenarian inventor still visited the West Orange laboratory every day, defiantly punching in and out on his very own time card.
<P>
<a name="1931"></a><img src="IMG/1931.gif" alt="1931"><p>
Edison did not believe in exercise, chewed tobacco continuously and smoked several cigars a day. For many years, his only foods were milk and the occasional glass of orange juice. And yet ulcers, diabetes and Bright's disease could not dim the persistent luster in Edison's gaze. (He died on October 18, 1931.) Toward the end, he emerged from a coma, looked upward at his wife, Mina, and said, "It is very beautiful over there."

<I>The September single-topic issue, "What You Need to Know about Cancer,"
generated a considerable volume of mail from readers who have been touched
by the disease-physicians, patients, friends and family members. We offer
a sampling of responses.</I><HR>

<CENTER><B>TREATMENT OF PAIN</B></CENTER>

<P>You are to be commended for the excellent issue on cancer. Kathleen M.
Foley's article, "Controlling the Pain of Cancer," was right on target.
Having witnessed four family members painfully succumb to cancer, I
learned firsthand just how lacking the medical community and government
regulators are in their knowledge of pain control. Administering
pain-relieving medications without fear of overdose or addiction is
imperative to the comfort of the dying.

<P><I>EMILY CLEMENTS DOUCETTE Pompano Beach, Fla.</I>


<HR><CENTER><B>TAKING RESPONSIBILITY</B></CENTER>

<P>In "Cancer's Psychological Challenges," Jimmie C. Holland advises those
stricken with the disease, "Do not believe that you caused your cancer."
Although this may be good psychological advice, a "two packs a day" person
suffering from terminal lung cancer would have difficulty following it.
This patient's responsibility is clearly described in the lucid articles
"What Causes Cancer?," by Dimitrios Trichopoulos, Frederick P. Li and
David J. Hunter, and "Strategies for Minimizing Cancer Risk," by Walter C.
Willett, Graham A. Colditz and Nancy E. Mueller, both of which demonstrate
that the majority of cancers stem from preventable causes such as smoking
and poor diet.

<P><I>PETER E. SANDOR Toronto, Ontario</I>


<HR><CENTER><B>EARLY DETECTION</B></CENTER>

<P>How does one say thank you for the gift of early detection of colorectal
cancer, which led to my expeditious cure? I am 48 years old and hadn't had
a complete physical for five years: I was healthy and had a good family
history, so I thought physicals were unnecessary unless I was feeling
sick. I picked up your September issue at the airport to give to a friend
who has a family history of cancer. On the ight, I read the Editors' fact
sheet, "Twelve Major Cancers," about warning signs, detection and
diagnosis of cancer and realized that I had actually experienced some
minor, intermittent symptoms of colorectal cancer.

When I got home, I immediately made an appointment with my doctor, who
discovered a malignant polyp in my colon. Part of my colon was removed a
few days later; fortunately, the cancer had not spread. The doctors caught
the tumor before it spread because I went in early; I went in early
because I read your special issue. My heartfelt thanks to everyone who
worked on the project.

<P><I>C. JILL JONES Redwood City, Calif.</I>


<HR><CENTER><B>OBSTACLES AT THE FDA?</B></CENTER>

<P>In "What Are Obstacles to Ideal Care?," W. Wayt Gibbs wrote that "since
March, when the Food and Drug Administration announced that it was
lowering its efficacy standards for cancer drugs and clearing the backlog
of those awaiting approval, several new agents have made it to market."
Readers could gain the impression that efficacy standards for approval of
cancer drugs have been made lower than those for other drugs and that the
FDA was acting to cope with a significant backlog. Both impressions would
be incorrect. The principal intent of the cancer initiatives announced
this past March is to accelerate the availability of new drugs for
patients with cancers refractory to currently available treatments;
achieving this goal will not compromise the FDA's standards for
effectiveness and safety of new drugs. Furthermore, there has been no
recent backlog of marketing applications for cancer drugs at the FDA; in
the past several years, all applications submitted to the Division of
Oncology Drug Products have been processed on or ahead of the timelines
set forth by Congress in 1992.

<P><I>ROBERT J. DELAP Director, Division of Oncology Drug Products Food and Drug
Administration</I>

<HR><CENTER><B>SCREENING FOR PROSTATE CANCER</B></CENTER>

<P>The outstanding article by Gerald E. Hanks and Peter T. Scardino ["Does
Screening for Prostate Cancer Make Sense?"] omits mention of the
reproducibility and false interpretations of tests measuring
prostate-specific antigen (PSA). It is known that the condition
prostatitis can lead to elevated scores, for example, but there is no
information on how unrelated illnesses can also cause dramatic rises. I
took a PSA test recently when I visited the hospital because of a stomach
ailment. The score had jumped from my normal level of five to 43. I chose
a repeat test rather than a biopsy. In a week my score had dropped to
22-still a troubling result. But being a physicist, I theorized that the
numbers would fall exponentially with time. Repeated measurements showed
this precise behavior, and after four weeks my score returned to normal,
where it has remained ever since.

<BR><B>JANUARY 1947</B>

<P>"Using a radar-transmitter tube and a horn antenna, an unusual cooker, called
Radarange, bakes biscuits and gingerbread in 29 seconds, cooks hamburgers with
onion in 35 seconds, and grills a frankfurter and roll in ten seconds. The
equipment beams the radio-frequency output into the food being cooked. In
operation, when cooking is completed, a timer automatically shuts off the machine
and the food is ready to eat, according to the Raytheon Manufacturing Company."

<P>"Vibration tests are absolutely essential in aircraft and rockets designed to
approach the speed of sound. The principle of resonant vibration is now being
utilized for structural tests. Electronic shaker units, essentially like a radio
loudspeaker, are positioned near the structure being tested. The moving element
of each shaker is coupled to a metal rod that fits onto a rubber suction cup
attached to the structure. The shaker need only be energized at the natural
vibrating frequency of the structure in order to produce, in a few minutes,
vibrating forces so strong that iron beams snap in two and 30-ton bombers
actually bounce off their landing wheels."

<P>"It is really astonishing to find what effects odors can have on purchasers. A
case in point: scented hosiery is bought in preference to unscented hosiery, but,
oddly enough, a survey has shown that purchasers are not consciously influenced
by the odor; they imagine that the scented goods have a better texture or a more
appealing color."

<P>"When the city-fathers of a municipality decide to spend some of the taxpayers'
money for a new sewage-disposal or water-supply system, one type of piping, made
from asbestos fibers and cement, is at or near the top of the list. It is free
from various types of corrosion, and its internal smoothness keeps flow capacity
at a peak through the years."

<P><HR>

<BR><B>JANUARY 1897</B>

<P>"An invention which promises to be of the greatest practical value in the world of
telegraphy has received its first public announcement at the hands of Mr. William
H. Preece, the telegraphic expert of the London post office. During a lecture on
'Telegraphy Without Wires' recently delivered in London, Mr. Preece introduced a
young Italian, a Mr. Marconi, who, he said, had recently come to him with such a
system. Telegraphing without wires was, of course, no new idea. In 1893 telegrams
were transmitted a distance of three miles across the Bristol Channel by
induction. But young Marconi solved the problem on entirely different principles,
and post office officials had made a successful test on Salisbury Plain at a
distance of three-quarters of a mile."

<P>"Crowding close on the heels of famine comes the bubonic plague, and to-day half
the population of Bombay have fled from the city. The point which most interests
Europeans is whether the awful disease is likely to flourish in northern
latitudes if the infection is introduced there; but no evidence is forthcoming as
yet. Dr. Waldemar Haffkine, who is investigating the subject in Bombay, fastens
the responsibility for carrying the infection upon rats, and ants. Rats have the
plague. They die and are eaten by ants, which carry the germs into the crevices
of buildings and to watertaps and sinks. Thus the poison is diffused and cannot
be eradicated except by fire. Dr. Haffkine has, it is said, proved the efficiency
of attenuated plague virus as an antidote for the disease."

<P>"Our engraving shows the working of a new style of elevator which is being put to
a practical test by the trustees of the Brooklyn Bridge. It is the invention of
Mr. Jesse W. Reno, who, by way of introducing it to public and official notice,
erected this same machine at Coney Island last September, where it carried over
75,000 people. The movable flooring has an inclination of 25 degrees, the
vertical lift being 7 feet."

<P><HR>

<BR><B>JANUARY 1847</B>

<P>"An iron bridge, in size and magnificence, perhaps, never before equaled, is about
to be erected, with a viaduct across the Tyne, from Gateshead to
Newcastle-upon-Tyne, for the Newcastle and Berwick railway. The contractors are
to make, supply, and erect all the cast and wrought iron and wood work for
bridges and approaches, according to the designs, and under the instructions of
Robert Stephenson, Esq." <I>[Editors' note: Opened in 1849, the High Level Bridge
still carries road and rail traffic across the Tyne.]</I>

So that winter-sports enthusiasts can enjoy prime conditions, most ski resorts
blanket their slopes with man-made snow. Freezing water to make snow might seem
easy, but it is a fascinating manufacturing process. Natural snowflakes usually
crystallize around dust motes or pollution--particles on which water molecules
can condense. These "ice nucleators" are essential; pure distilled water can
otherwise remain liquid even at -40 degrees Celsius, a phenomenon known as
supercooling. So resort snowmakers sometimes add nucleators to their recipes.

<P>The nucleator at the heart of many man-made snowflakes is a natural protein
named Snomax [see box at top]. Steve Lindow, a professor of plant pathology at
the University of California at Berkeley, first noted the properties of Snomax in
1975, when he was a graduate student at the University of Wisconsin investigating
ways to protect plants from frost damage. Today about half the ski resorts in
North America use his discovery, which, on average, increases snow production by
50 percent and yields lighter, drier flakes. At the 1994 Winter Olympics in
Lillehammer, Norway, all the man-made snow on the competition routes was produced
with Snomax.

IN FOCUS

<center><H2>FLIGHT OF FANCY</H2>

Will a new kind of submersible<BR> truly benefit research?</center>

<P>To the oohs and aahs of a handpicked audience and the whir of camera shutters,
Graham S. Hawkes gently tugs away a logo-emblazoned veil to reveal a new and
truly odd submarine. Adorned with tail fins, stubby wings and a hull hardly
bigger than a coffin, <A HREF="http://www.deepflight.com/"><I> Deep Flight</I> </A>would look more at home on a movie set than on
this corner patio of the Monterey Bay Aquarium in California. That is probably no
coincidence-the eight-year project was funded in large part by television and
film companies. But Hawkes, a veteran ocean engineer and the craft's creator,
sketches a grandiose vision of the science to be enabled by his new designs.

<P>"We live on an aquatic planet with most of the biosphere under the sea. The bulk
of it remains unexplored," he expounds. Current tools for oceanic research, he
asserts, are too slow, cumbersome and expensive: "To open up access to the deep
ocean, we're going to have to learn how to fly underwater." Hence <I>Deep Flight's</I>
strange stature. In other submersibles that can transport a human to the ocean's
depths, the pilot sits upright and maneuvers using directional thrusters. In this
sub, which is designed to dive down to one kilometer, the pilot lies prone as the
craft flies through the water. Puttering slowly around the shallows near the
aquarium, Hawkes shows how flaps on the vehicle's wings and tail allow it to
turn, dive and roll-much like an airplane with its wings on upside down. The sub
even floats toward the surface if it stops (and the wings stall), a feature that
makes the craft safer but also prevents it from hovering over the bottom.

<P>Later, after a champagne reception, several distinguished scientists join Hawkes
to share publicly their enthusiasm for the day's events and to drum up backing
for <I>Deep Flight II</I>, a successor designed to dive 11 times as far, down to the
very deepest part of the ocean floor. The panel reflects the oceanographic
community's general support for piloted submersibles despite their stiff
competition from robots called ROVs (remotely operated vehicles) that do their
undersea work tethered to a ship on the surface. <I>Deep Flight</I>, exclaims Bruce H.
Robison, a marine biologist at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, is
pioneering "a revolutionary technology that I firmly believe will lead to
revolutionary scientific discoveries."

<P>The sub's key advantage, he contends, is its mobility: "It can acquire continuous
data over kilometers, allowing us to study questions that can't be answered with
small-scale measurements. Where do the salmon go? Why do the tuna swim with the
dolphins?"

<P>Sylvia A. Earle, former chief scientist for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration and Hawkes's business partner, invokes a more visceral argument
for sending a person to the bottom. "Three-dimensional imaging and head-coupled
camera systems can come pretty close to transporting your presence down to a
remote vehicle," she concedes. "But you aren't twitching with every nerve,
because you are warm and dry sitting on the surface. If some problem happens, you
don't have the same edge pushing you to solve it."

<P>Neither, as some more detached scientists are quick to point out, do you have the
same handicaps. Maurice A. Tivey, a geologist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution who has conducted research on the ocean bottom using a variety of
underwater vehicles, notes that with an ROV, scientists on the support ship can
leave the control room at will (when, for example, nature calls). And if need be,
they can fetch a specialist to help them interpret images of objects below.
Whereas a submersible is limited by batteries (<I>Deep Flight</I> can run for less than
four hours, or for about 20 kilometers), ROVs can provide a virtual presence
underwater for days on end. During a recent expedition with an ROV, Tivey boasts,
"we were on the seafloor for 87 hours straight."

<P>Still, piloted submersibles have traditionally had an advantage in their heft.
Geologists such as Tivey sometimes need to extract samples from formations on the
seafloor, and ROVs lack the mass necessary to break things off. Woods Hole
biologist Lauren S. Mullineaux further suggests that <I>Alvin</I> (a three-person
undersea vehicle operated by the institution) can perform delicate experimental
manipulations more easily because it can plant itself firmly on the ocean floor.
ROVs, which typically use thrusters to hover over the bottom, tend to be less
stable.

<P>But <I>Deep Flight</I> and its successors will be little bigger or stronger than many
ROVs. And because winged subs would tend to float upward when they stopped
moving, pilots would find close, stationary work difficult. Moreover, says <A HREF="http://seawifs.gsfc.nasa.gov/JASON/HTML/PEOPLE_ballard.html">Robert
D. Ballard</A>, president of the Institute for Exploration, in Mystic, Conn., the
complications of using ROVs are negligible compared with the main drawback of
submersibles: the physical risk at which they put their occupants. Ballard, whose
name became synonymous with deep-sea exploration after his investigations of the
wreck of the <I>Titanic</I>, is perhaps one of the most vocal champions of the kind of
ROV technology that he and colleagues at Woods Hole-and, ironically, Graham
Hawkes-helped to pioneer. Certainly, he admits, exploring the deep in person is
more exciting, more romantic: "When I landed on the <I>Titanic</I> with <I>Alvin</I>, it was
definitely spiritually different" than steering tethered vehicles around the
sunken liner with a joystick. Nevertheless, Ballard says, "Robots are better."

<P>Ballard believes oceanographers remain reluctant to use ROVs instead of
submersibles out of an inherent conservatism. Most researchers, he finds, are
willing to take risks in formulating their scientific ideas but not in testing
them: they do not want to take the chance that unexpected problems with new
technology will foul up their experiments. Piloted subs are a known quantity,
with a longer track record than ROVs. Yet Ballard maintains that although
delicate manipulations may be trickier when looking at a video monitor rather
than out a window, time pressure is much less severe. And in many cases, he says,
the video camera actually offers a clearer view or a better vantage point than
the view ports of a deep-diving submersible.

<P>Although Ballard applauds the construction of <I>Deep Flight</I> and is intrigued by the
prospect of flying gracefully through the abyss, he doubts the diminutive sub
offers much value for scientists: "I would be the first person who would want to
ride-but I'm not putting it on my research grant." Without the advantages of size
and stability that scientists such as Tivey and Mullineaux want for their
research, it is not clear who, if anyone, will pay for a multimillion-dollar
flying submarine. Preliminary sketches of a 10-seat "tour sub" that Hawkes
presented at the postlaunch symposium may reveal his thoughts on that question.
So perhaps the new underwater craft could be better labeled: Ballard calls it "a
recreational vehicle, pure and simple."

<center><H2>STEPS TO RECOVERY</H2>

Researchers find ways of<br>coaxing spinal nerves to regrow
</center>

<P>Nerves throughout most of the body regenerate when they are damaged, just like
any other tissue. Damage to the central nervous system, however-the brain and
spinal cord-is different. Something goes tragically wrong. Nerve bundles start
feebly to repair themselves but then degenerate around the site of the injury.
For many patients, that means life confined to a wheelchair.

<P>Experiments in two laboratories now seem to bear out earlier indications that the
degeneration is not because of an intrinsic inability of spinal nerves to regrow.
Rather it seems to be a consequence of a separate effect that may be
controllable.

<P>Nurit Kalderon and Zvi Fuks of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New
York City did most of their experiments on rats that had just one side of their
spinal cord cut. The investigators found that treating the injury with high doses
of x-rays during the third week after injury allowed nerve cells to grow across
the site and prevented the usual degeneration. Subsequent experiments confirmed
that nerve impulses could be transmitted across injury sites following x-ray
treatment during the critical time window. The treatment even allowed some rats
that had suffered a complete cut across their spinal cord to regain partial use
of their hind limbs. Kalderon, who described the work in the <A HREF="http://journals.at-home.com/get_doc/481175/8849"><I>Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences</I></A>, believes the effect works because the x-rays kill
specialized nervous system cells that slowly migrate to the site of an injury and
cause incidental damage.

<P>Michal Schwartz and her colleagues at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel
used a different system to encourage regeneration in severed rat optic nerves.
Schwartz found evidence that she could promote regrowth of nerve cells by
injecting the injury with immune system cells-macrophages-that she had previously
incubated with nerves that can regenerate, such as the sciatic nerve in the leg.
Macrophages allowed to sit for 24 hours with sciatic nerve caused optic nerve
cells to regrow across the cut. Schwartz, who described the results last fall in
the <I>FASEB Journal</I>, has conducted similar experiments on spinal cord and achieved
the same kind of results.

<P>Schwartz believes, in contrast to Kalderon's theory, the central nervous system
of mammals prevents immune cells from carrying out a function that is essential
to recovery. Perhaps, she suggests, mammals have evolved a way of suppressing
immune system activity in the central nervous system in order to avoid damaging
inammation that could disrupt mental functioning. The suppression might have a
net benefit except in serious injuries. Schwartz maintains that she has
identified a previously unknown molecule in the central nervous system that
causes immune suppression, and an affiliate of the Weizmann Institute has
licensed her system for spinal cord regrowth to a start-up firm in New York City,
Proneuron Biotechnologies.

<P>Wise Young of the New York University Medical Center, a prominent researcher in
the field, says he has no doubt that Kalderon "has a very interesting phenomenon
on her hands" with x-ray-induced healing. But he emphasizes that her experiments
must be repeated, because untreated rats often exhibit a surprising degree of
recovery from incomplete damage, sometimes learning to walk again. Young wonders
whether an infection or other extraneous effect might have hurt Kalderon's
untreated animals, thus making the x-ray-treated groups appear better off by
comparison. Schwartz's results, which employed only a few animals, also have
alternative explanations, Young thinks. The central nervous system might, for
example, simply lack an important element rather than have some active means to
suppress immune function.

<P>Young asserts that the value of Kalderon's and Schwartz's theories should become
clearer when current studies with standardized experimental systems are complete.
But some success with a different approach to spinal cord repair had been
reported earlier by Henrich Cheng, Yihai Cao and Lars Olson of the Karolinska
Institute in Stockholm. The team, which described its results last July in
<A HREF="http://www.sciencemag.org/science/scripts/display/short/273/5274/510.html"><I>Science</I></A>, removed a section of rats' spinal cords, bridged the gap with nerves
transplanted from another part of the body and finally added a protein glue
containing a nerve growth factor. The rats regained some use of their hind limbs,
a demonstration that Young terms a "milestone."

<P>The Swedish technique is not directly applicable to humans, unless a way is found
to achieve regeneration without removing a section of cord that may still perform
some function (most injuries leave tissue intact). Experiments are continuing,
although Young says progress is still slower than he would like. Fewer than 30
laboratories in the U.S. are engaged in spinal cord injury research. And the $40
million the U.S. spends on the field will need to be doubled, he says, to pursue
all promising avenues.

The moist, black lignite breaks into rough planes studded with weathered
grains of red amber. Carefully, I crumble away the matrix to extract
the globules, some only five millimeters wide. A few feet away David A.
Grimaldi of the American Museum of Natural History takes a pickax to a
large chunk of earth, breaking into curses when he discovers in its
depths the fractured remnants of a fist-size piece of amber. The
extremely brittle fossilized globs of tree sap are 93 million years
old. In them are stuck flowers, leaves and insects that lived in a
grove of giant conifers, at a time when the first flowering plants
appeared.

<P>We are in New Jersey, an hour and a half from New York City. The taxi
driver had looked quite suspicious when we asked to be dropped off at
the roadside, at no address at all. (For security reasons, the location
is kept secret.) Slouched in the sun on a vast sandy riverbed, we are
sorting through soil that a bulldozer has just excavated from 10 feet
below. A few hundred yards away, forming a horizon, sit brand-new rows
of boxlike prefab housing. Bordering the empty riverbed are cliffs that
harbor exquisitely preserved flowers, turned into charcoal by an
ancient forest fire; a heap of old tires lies at their base.

<P>The site was discovered about five years ago by Gerard Case, a fossil
hunter who has been prospecting the East Coast for 35 years. Grimaldi
relates how Case walked into his office one day and put a bagful of
amber on his desk, saying the classic line: "I have something here you
might be interested in." There are several amber deposits in the
region; early in this century clay miners on Staten Island burned the
fragrant fossil in barrels to keep warm at night.

<P>The amber from this site embalms the greatest diversity of Cretaceous
life ever found. "The community is preserved in beautiful detail,"
Grimaldi explains, so that ecological connections between its members
can be inferred. Why flowering trees suddenly proliferated in that
period remains controversial. The 80 taxa of charcoal flowers unearthed
here, in combination with hundreds of kinds of insects--some related to
modern pollinators--may help solve that mystery.

<P>Today we have hit a rich vein. The lignite, made of compressed forest
litter, is loose; the forms and patterns of the original leaves are
still evident in places. Alongside the amber occur glittering nodules
of pyrite. "Easy to see how people got bit by gold fever in the old
days," offers volunteer Jamie Luzzi. I hear a long-drawn-out "Oh, man":
Caroline Chaboo, also of the museum, is holding up a large, clear,
wine-red fragment and grinning with delight. A big piece very likely
has more insects, and its transparency allows them to be seen. A local
resident walking his Labradors brings us ice-cream cookie sandwiches.
We stop and eat, wiping off our filthy fingers on our jeans.

<P>Soon the lignite will be exhausted. Like other amber sites in suburbia,
the riverbed is destined to be developed, probably into an industrial
park. The prospect doesn't bother Grimaldi. "Any amber left will far
outlive anything built here," he muses. "If it becomes a parking lot,
the amber is sealed in. It is protected for generations to come." When
we leave, fatigued, the sun is setting over the tract housing, throwing
long shadows of its pointed rooftops across the sand.

<FONT SIZE="2"><B>SOUFRIERE HILLS VOLCANO</B> looms over the island population of Montserat, threatening calamity.</FONT></TD>

<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=336>

When a volcano becomes restless, people living nearby often turn to scientific
specialists to help them judge the danger. Residents of the Caribbean island of
Montserrat did just that in July 1995, when the long-dormant <A HREF="http://www.geo.mtu.edu/volcanoes/west.indies/soufriere/">Soufriere Hills
volcano</A> became clearly active. But after more than a year of monitoring seismic
rumbling, gas venting and bulging of the mountain, the experts are still
struggling to anticipate what exactly the volcano will do next. Although
stunningly advanced in comparison to earthquake prediction, forecasting
volcanic eruptions remains uncomfortably inexact.

<P>The ongoing crisis on Montserrat may be a perfect example of the challenges of
forecasting volcanic hazards. After the first series of steam-driven eruptions
in the summer of 1995, public officials on Montserrat evacuated thousands of
people from the southern part of the island. But after three weeks without a
catastrophic eruption, residents were allowed to return home-temporarily.

<P>Throughout the following autumn, the volcano remained sporadically alive, with
magma eventually breaching the surface. Initially this molten rock had ascended
comparatively slowly, allowing the volatile gases it contained to escape
gradually. So rather than exploding like uncorked champagne, the lava gently
built a mound of new rock. But by the spring of 1996 the volcano began to
generate dangerous pyroclastic ows--fiery-hot mixtures of volcanic debris that
can travel down the slopes of the mountain at the speed of an automobile. (This
behavior stands in contrast to the recent eruptions in Iceland, where the
rising magma lacks volatiles and thus seeps out without exploding.)

<P>"I think that the greatest hazards are from pyroclastic ows," explains William
B. Ambeh of the University of the West Indies in Trinidad, who has been a
leader of the fledgling Montserrat Volcano Observatory. But the danger of
explosive activity is also of great concern: recently small explosions hurled
hot "rock bombs" a kilometer or more into a nearby settlement. This energetic
behavior is consistent with the scientists' conclusion that the rising magma is
now moving upward more rapidly.

<P>Does this mean that a truly big bang is impending? Ambeh does not expect to see
sudden explosions on a scale larger than those that have already occurred. But
he readily admits that the geologists working on the problem have a wide range
of opinion about what the volcano might or might not do next, even though they
are armed with a dizzying array of sophisticated monitoring
equipment--seismometers, laser range finders, satellite surveying instruments
and gas analyzers. Ambeh and his colleagues on Montserrat have tried to keep
track of the myriad uncertainties using "probability trees," a formalized
system that Christopher G. Newhall of the U.S. Geological Survey has
championed. 

<P>This methodology prompts the scientists to identify possible events
and assign numerical probabilities to each of them. This approach can help
volcanologists communicate their forecasts to public officials and can aid
scientists in thinking through clearly the difficult problem of charting the
likelihood of different eventualities. "In a crisis situation, you can jump to
conclusions; you can be spooked; you can be running on an hour of sleep a
night," Newhall explains.

<P>Yet probability trees do not necessarily add precision to the forecasts. The
past success of such trees in showing the imminent danger from the Mount
Pinatubo volcano in the Philippines just weeks before its violent eruption in
June 1991 may represent the exceptional case. C. Daniel Miller, a geologist at
the USGS's Cascades Volcano Observatory, says it was, in part, just good luck
that the Pinatubo volcano went ahead and erupted before people became inured to
the warnings. 

<P>Newhall believes the geologists involved in managing a volcanic
crisis can typically offer specific forecasts that are only good to within a
factor of 10. Thus, in hazardous situations such as the one now plaguing
Montserrat, even the best scientific experts often cannot distinguish with any
assurance whether a coming eruption will be large or small, whether it will
occur within a few weeks or not for many months. Newhall observes, "I've seen
scientists try to cut it closer than that, but they get into trouble."

ANTI GRAVITY

<center><h2>Chewing the Fat</h2></center>

<p>In any list of history's greatest inventions, the usual suspects include the
telephone, the automobile, the computer. The thermos bottle always gets a few
votes. (Keeps hot things hot, cold things cold-how does it know?) But has
humanity ever really come up with anything better than cream cheese? The phone
is merely a convenient way to order cheesecakes. The car serves as a vehicle
for getting to where the bagels are. The home computer is just a way for
millions to work just steps from their chilled cream cheese caches. And the
thermos, of course, holds the coffee to go with the cakes and bagels.

<P><table cellpadding=1 align=left width=145><tr>

</FONT></td>
</tr></table>


<p>Cream cheese's standing thus demonstrated, what then to make of a scientific
study in which human subjects fasted for 10 hours, then got rewarded with cream
cheese-covered crackers every five minutes for an hour, which they dutifully
chewed until the resulting smoothness danced on every taste bud? And which they
then spit into a bucket?

<p>Amazingly, the study was not evaluating the psychological effects of torture.
Rather the research showed that just tasting fat, without actually taking it
in, somehow raises the levels of blood triglycerides, the form in which fat
gets stored and transported.

<p>All 15 subjects in the study, conducted by Purdue University nutritionist
Richard D. Mattes, went through the ordeal on four randomized occasions. First
came the preparation: each subject swallowed 50 one-gram capsules of safflower
oil. That gave the gut a fat reservoir approximating a concurrent meal, without
having the mouth come in direct contact with any of the fat. "The amount of fat
was the equivalent of one serving of Ben & Jerry's butter pecan," Mattes says.
Not as good a load as three servings perhaps, but acceptable for scientific
purposes.

<p>Then came the actual tastings. On one day subjects got the real deal: full-fat
cream cheese. On a second, their crackers held dreaded nonfat cream cheese. In
a third run, Mattes cut the cheese, giving his volunteers unadorned crackers.
For the fourth pass, subjects received a firm handshake from a grateful
researcher. Blood samples revealed that levels of triglycerides almost doubled
when subjects masticated the full-fat cheese, but not the nonfat variety or the
plain crackers.

<p>"We don't know what is responsible," Mattes acknowledges. "One possibility is
that sensory stimulation enhances [fat] absorption from the gut. Another is
that your liver makes new triglycerides. And the third possibility is that
mechanisms for clearing fat from the blood are somehow turned down." A repeat
of the cream cheese experiment, without the safflower oil, is under way to
clear up at least the first scenario.

<p>Mattes's finding flies in the face of fat-fanciers' faith. The dogma is that
fat is a textural attribute, that you don't taste it, he says. In fact, in a
separate trial, participants were unable to differentiate between the full-fat
and nonfat cream cheeses. "But that doesn't explain our results. This suggests
that there is some kind of chemical detection system in the mouth," Mattes
concludes. Such a system has important implications for metabolic studies,
which have not paid attention to fat's sensory properties, he insists.

<p>The big business of creating fat substitutes also needs to pay attention to
this work--if some low-fat victuals contain a food concocted to provide the
"mouth feel" normally associated with fat, they might set off that chemosensory
mechanism. Hence, they may still cause the body to free up fat stores,
circulating them in the blood where they can harden arteries. On the other
hand, fat substitutes lower the intake of real fat. On a third hand, anecdotal
evidence has it that there is no fat in any foods eaten while standing over the
sink, sneaked after midnight or pilfered from the plate of your dinner
companion.

For some time, many naturalists have felt that the world is entering a period
of major species extinction, rivaling five other periods in the past half a
billion years. A new study by the <A HREF="http://w3.iprolink.ch/iucnlib/themes/ssc/index.html"> World Conservation Union</A> (also known as the
IUCN), issued in October 1996, provides strong support for this theory. Using
more thorough study methods than previously, the IUCN finds a much higher level
of threat to several classes of animals than was generally thought. It found that
an astonishing 25 percent of mammal species-and comparable proportions of
reptile, amphibian and fish species-are threatened. Of five classes of animals,
birds are the least at risk [<I>see bar chart</I> ].

<P>
<table cellpadding=1 align=right <tr>
<td>
<IMG SRC="IMG/0197scicit6a.gif" WIDTH="250" 
BORDER="0"><br clear=all>
</td>
</tr></table>

Of the 4,327 known mammal species, 1,096 are at risk, and 169 are in the
highest category of "critically endangered"--extremely high risk of extinction in
the wild in the immediate future. (The other two are "endangered," meaning very
high risk in the near future, and "vulnerable," a high risk in the medium-term
future.) Of the 26 orders of mammals, 24 are threatened. Among the most affected
are elephants, primates and <I>Perissodactyla</I>  species (such as rhinoceroses and
tapirs).

<P>Although the IUCN data probably understate the number of threatened mammal
species in some regions, it is possible to draw conclusions about the pattern on
the map, in particular, that habitat disturbance by humans increases the threat
to mammals. Also important is a high proportion of endemic species, especially in
the case of geographically isolated areas. Such regions have unique evolutionary
histories and fixed boundaries to species ranges, and thus, degradation of such
habitats is more likely to take a toll on animals. Striking examples are the
Philippines and Madagascar, where 32 and 44 percent, respectively, of all mammal
species are threatened. In both countries, well over half the species are
endemic, and habitat disturbance is high. In contrast are Canada and the U.S.
with, respectively, 4 and 8 percent of mammal species threatened. Less than a
quarter of the species in the U.S. and only 4 percent in Canada are endemic.
Habitat disturbance is moderately above average in the U.S. and very low in
Canada.

<P>The countries with the most threatened mammals are Indonesia, with 128
species, and China and India, both with 75. These three account for 43 percent of
the world's population and are among the most densely populated.

IN BRIEF

<P><B>Women Gain on Pain</B>

<P>Morphine, codeine, Percodan. These mu-opioids, which mimic the body's own
painkilling endorphins, are among the most powerful drugs around. Until now,
kappa-opioids, chemical cousins that act on different endorphin receptors in the
brain, were considered second rate. But a recent study at the University of
California at San Francisco has found that kappa-opioids can work as well and
cause fewer side effects, but only in women. Lead researcher Jon D. Levine
speculates that testosterone counteracts the kappa-agonists in men or that the
brain circuitry for pain relief differs between the sexes.

<P><HR><B>Not So Smart Cards</B>

<P>The public-key encryption schemes and digital signatures that secure your bank
card can now be crippled through brute force, report Bellcore scientists Dan
Boneh, Richard DeMillo and Richard Lipton. They describe an algorithmic attack
that gleans critical information from computational errors liable to occur when a
smart card-or any other tamperproof device used in networked
transactions-undergoes physical stress. Because the method does not rely on
solving the difficult problems, such as factoring large numbers, on which most
encryption schemes are based, it presents an all-new kind of threat.

<P><HR><B>Femtosecond Flash</B>

<P>Tracking an atom during a chemical change is trickier than spying on Clark Kent
switching to his Superman suit. Most reactions take place in mere femtoseconds,
or hundred millionths of a billionth of a second. But now scientists at Lawrence
Berkeley National Laboratory have created a superfast x-ray for the job. By
crossing the path of an infrared laser and a tightly focused electron beam, they
produced x-ray pulses lasting only 300 femtoseconds. Unlike lasers previously
used in this way, the x-rays interact directly with nuclei and core electrons and
so better reveal atomic structure.

<P><HR><B>Earliest Earthlings</B>

<P>The oldest known bacterial fossils, found back in 1993, are some 3.5 billion
years old, but new evidence reported in Nature hints that life on the earth in
fact began 300 million years earlier. Burrowing into 3.8-billion-year-old rock in
Greenland, scientists led by Gustaf Arrhenius of the Scripps Institution of
Oceanography found "light" carbon isotopes sealed in grains of calcium
phosphate-samples that could have resulted only from organic activity. The
mystery now is how quickly evolution must have proceeded at that time, only 200
million years after the planet was steadily being bombarded with sterilizing
meteorites.

<P><HR><B>Preventive Payback</B>

<P>Cancer deaths have, for the first time in U.S. history, declined. A study in the
November 1996 issue of Cancer  reports that mortality rates fell by some 3.1
percent from 1990 to 1995. The authors credit improved medical care, as well as
reductions in smoking and in exposure to other environmental carcinogens.


<P><HR><B>Making a Better Brew</B>

<P>To curb the effects of carbonyls-chemicals that curdle beer's taste-brewers have
in the past added sulfites. Yeast produces these natural preservatives during
fermentation, but another compound, S-adenosyl methionine, quickly breaks them
down. Now genetic engineers at Carlsberg in Denmark have created strains of yeast
that lack the genes encoding S-adenosyl methionine. Compared with wild strains,
these organisms yield 10 times more sulfite and so potentially a fresher brew as
well.

<P><HR><B>Genetic Junkyards</B>

<P>Last year scientists charting the human genome put many key landmarks on the map.
Now they have filled in street addresses for 16,354 genes-many of unknown
function. Of greater interest, some of the new genetic neighborhoods are heavily
populated, whereas others are deserted. One theory posits that barren stretches
in the genome may be junkyards for discarded DNA scraps. The map is available at
<A HREF="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SCIENCE96/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SCIENCE96/</A>.


<P><HR><B>The Price of Silence</B>

<P>Explaining why high blood pressure is more common among blacks than whites is not
hard. To some extent, socioeconomic and environmental differences divide the
races in terms of risk. Also, some evidence suggests that blacks have a genetic
predisposition to the disease. But a new study from the Harvard School of Public
Health cites another source: racial discrimination. The researchers found that
blacks who challenged unjust acts were less likely to have high blood pressure
than those who did not and so presumably internalized their reaction.


<P><HR><B>FOLLOW-UP</B>

<P><B>Under the Wire.</B> A committee from the National Research Council has concluded that electromagnetic
fields (EMFs) pose no real health threat, as was first alleged in 1979. The group
surveyed more than 500 studies conducted over the past 17 years investigating the
link between EMFs and, among other diseases, cancer, reproductive abnormalities
and behavioral problems. They found that only exposures 1,000 to 10,000 times
stronger than what is common in residential settings could alter cellular
function; in no study did EMF exposure affect cellular DNA.
(See <A HREF="http://www.sciam.com/0996issue/0996trichopoulos.html">What Causes Cancer</A> from September 1996.)

<P><B>Young Planets Shine Brightly.</B> Through current ground-based telescopes, distant
planets are a million times more faint than their parent stars. But new work from
Alan Stern at the Southwest Research Institute suggests that some planned
facilities, such as the Keck Interferometer in Hawaii, will easily spot the
infrared radiation of young planets. For 100 to 1,000 years after birth, frequent
and large impacts (events postulated by the standard theory of planetary
formation) can render a planet molten, making its infrared radiation some 10,000
times greater than it will ultimately be.

MEDICAL DIAGNOSTICS

<center><H2>FETAL CHECKUP</H2>

A simple blood test can<BR>
replace invasive procedures<BR>
such as amniocentesis
</center>

<P>Geneticists have devised numerous tests to learn whether a fetus is likely to
develop a serious inherited disease during gestation. All these tests, however,
need a specimen of fetal cells. Until now, that has meant either amniocentesis or
chorionic villus sampling. Both techniques involve putting a needle into the
uterus to extract cells from either amniotic fluid or embryonic membrane, and
both can be painful for the mother-to-be. More disturbing, once in every 50 to
100 pregnancies, the procedures trigger a miscarriage, and there are suggestions
that villus sampling can very occasionally cause limb deformities in the fetus.

<P>Separate teams of researchers in Japan and California have recently demonstrated
a novel way to obtain fetal cells without any such risk. The scientists have
found an apparently reliable way to isolate immature red blood cells belonging to
the fetus from a sample of the mother's blood. They have also shown that they can
use the cells successfully to perform various kinds of genetic tests on the
fetus.

<P>Researchers have known for over a decade that a few fetal blood cells leak into
the mother's circulation. Isolating them routinely has, however, proved to be a
challenge, because fetal cells account for only one in several million of the
mother's own. Until a little over a year ago, most attempts to pick out fetal
cells concentrated on lymphocytes, because unlike the far more numerous red blood
cells, they contain genes and so can be used for analysis. This strategy suffered
a setback in 1995, when U.S. investigators discovered, to their dismay, that
fetal lymphocytes can persist in a mother's blood for as long as 27 years. That
greatly limits their use, because a fetal lymphocyte in the blood of a pregnant
woman who carried an earlier fetus could be a survivor from the earlier
pregnancy.

<P>Efforts have therefore turned to trying to isolate fetal immature red blood
cells. Unlike mature red blood cells-which both mother and fetus have in
abundance-immature cells have nuclei containing genes, and unlike lymphocytes
they cannot survive for long. Akihiko Sekizawa of the National Center of
Neurology and Psychiatry in Tokyo and his colleagues first described a successful
application of the technique last year. They obtained blood samples from women
who were eight to 20 weeks pregnant and concentrated the fetal and maternal
immature red blood cells using standard laboratory techniques. They then
laboriously picked out fetal cells under the microscope and were able to test
them for Duchenne's muscular dystrophy and for the rhesus factor, which can cause
dangerous problems if a woman lacks the factor but her fetus has it. The work was
published in <I>Neurology</I> and in <I>Obstetrics and Gynecology</I>.

<P>Yuet Wai Kan and his associates at the University of California at San Francisco
have now made the technique easier. They first used an antibody to concentrate
fetal and maternal immature red blood cells. The U.S. researchers spread the
resulting cells on microscope slides and used a second antibody to stain just
those cells that were displaying characteristic fetal proteins. Under a
microscope they could then fairly easily pick up 10 or 20 stained cells (out of
several thousand unstained maternal cells) on the point of a fine needle. For
modern techniques of genetic analysis, 10 or 20 cells are plenty. Kan's work was
published in <I>Nature Genetics</I>.

<P>Kan and his colleagues have tested cells from fetuses that had been considered at
risk for sickle cell anemia, cystic fibrosis or beta-thalassemia and confirmed
that the fetuses did not in fact have those conditions. The diagnoses were
checked against cells that were obtained conventionally.

<P>Barring any problems that might emerge in bigger tests, there is no obvious
reason why Kan's technique should not be used with any genetic test for a
disorder caused by a mutation in a single gene. That covers many common genetic
diseases. Diane Bianchi of the New England Medical Center says the technique
might also be applicable to Down syndrome and other diseases caused by
whole-chromosome mutations. Such mutations often occur in harmless form in the
placenta, which could complicate diagnoses because placental cells may leak into
the mother's circulation. Bianchi is currently participating in a multicenter
study to check the value of fetal immature red blood cells for detecting Down
syndrome. And Kan points out that although his technique demands some skill and
is "quite tedious," it does not require expensive equipment or the costly time of
an obstetrician.

MICROELECTRONICS

<center><H2>CHILLING CHIPS</H2>

Microjets of air can <BR>cool chips, 
but...speak up!
</center>

<P>A smoke ring can be a pleasing thing to look at. At the Georgia Institute of
Technology, <A HREF="http://www.me.gatech.edu/people/faculty/Ari.Glezer.html"> Ari Glezer </A> and <A HREF="http://www.ee.gatech.edu/users/151/"> Mark G. Allen</A> are building devices that could boost
the power of computer chips by blowing similar vortices of fresh air.

<P>Keeping chips cool is a crucial requirement in electronic design. Fans are the
traditional solution, but they are cumbersome and inefficient. Glezer and Allen
adapted the principle behind a smoke-ring generator to make a device that
efficiently cools circuits and can be made small enough to chill individual
chips. The concept is straightforward: a box has one flexible wall and a hole, or
several holes, in the opposite wall. Vibrating the flexible wall at a suitable
frequency causes cooling jets of vortices to emerge from the holes.

Allen has made devices with holes as small as 100 microns in diameter. That makes
it possible to think of micromachining such devices into a chip, Glezer notes.
They need no external plumbing, and because the microjets are highly directional,
they can be pointed where needed. In one test, a device with a hole 1/16 of an
inch in diameter allowed the researchers to boost the power of an array of chips
by 150 percent, with no increase in temperature. Yet the power consumed by the
microjet device itself was only 3 percent of the power gained.

<P>Glezer and Allen's studies originated in work supported by the U.S. Air Force,
which is interested in using vastly larger versions for steering thrusters. For
cooling chips, an easily made piezoelectric crystal actuator suffices to drive
test devices, although other options are possible, Glezer says. Only one problem
looms: some actuators emit a whistle while they work. Practical versions might
have to be used with sound-absorbing padding. Provided, of course, the padding
does not make the chips warmer again. Technology development is seldom simple.

CHEMISTRY

<center><H2>MORE GALLONS PER MILE</H2>

Chemical signals narrow <BR>
the search for petroleum
</center>

<P>Prospecting for oil and gas used to be a matter of simply looking for places
where oil seeps to the surface, drilling nearby and hoping for the best. These
days the search for civilization's lifeblood is more scientific, and oil
companies spend many millions of dollars studying the types of rock formations
most likely to have trapped worthwhile reserves. Now they have a new tool that
could help find places worth exploring-and so eliminate some expensive dry holes.

<P>Researchers have identified in oil a pair of molecules that seems to reveal
how far the oil has migrated from its site of origin. Oil moves laterally through
the ground an inch or so every year as the force of buoyancy pushes it up from
the depths where it was formed through inclined layers of porous rock. Sometimes
it is trapped at accessible depths hundreds of miles from where it started.
Explorers already use chemical analysis to try to infer what kind of source rocks
are likely to have yielded a given sample. By adding information about how far
the sample has moved, they should rule out some suspects.

<P>The new markers of migration distance were described last fall in
<A HREF="http://www.nature.com/"> <I>Nature</I></A> by Steven R. Larter of the University of Newcastle in England,
together with a team of co-authors from Norsk Hydro and Saga Petroleum (both in
Norway), Shell and Imperial Oil Resources. The chemicals they studied are two
variant forms of a carbon- and nitrogen-containing compound called
benzocarbazole, which is present in all oils in trace amounts. Although the two
forms are chemically very similar, benzo[a]carbazole is slightly more readily
absorbed by clay and other minerals than benzo[c]carbazole, an effect the
researchers demonstrated experimentally by allowing oil to ooze through wet clay.
That means the farther oil moves, the less of the [a] form there is left compared
with the [c] form. Conveniently, the ratio does not depend on how long the oil
has been on the move.

<P>The benzocarbazole ratios in three well-studied oil fields in Europe and North
America seem to confirm the experimentally observed behavior, according to
Larter's <I>Nature</I> paper. Larter says other fields confirm the effect as
well. To use the compounds as markers of migration distance, prospectors have to
consider the estimated ratio of the compounds when the oil started its
subterranean migration. That adjustment can usually be made as observations
accumulate. "It is an important tool," declares Gary H. Isaksen of Exxon
Production Research, who notes that more studies will be needed before all the
limitations of the technique are clear. One possible difficulty is that vertical
migration may skew results.

<P>Isaksen notes the technique could be especially valuable for guiding offshore
exploration, where drilling is monumentally expensive. Offshore West Africa, the
Caspian Sea, and Sakhalin Island off Russia all have rich deposits that
benzocarbazoles might help explore. Isaksen says several companies, including his
own, have started to look at the compounds. And as long as oil companies can keep
finding black gold, there seems to be little doubt there will be customers.

</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=336>

These should be the best of times for telephone companies: demand for their
services is surging thanks to long-distance price wars and burgeoning Internet
use. But many firms were caught off guard by the run on bandwidth. The trunks of
their fiber-optic networks are perilously full, and some central offices are
running out of switches during peak periods. In response, many phone companies
are embracing a relatively new technology that can increase the data capacity of
their optical networks by 100-fold-perhaps, within a decade, by 1,000-fold.

<P>Last spring research groups at AT&T, Fujitsu and Nippon Telegraph and
Telephone (NTT) announced that they had successfully sent data at more than one
trillion bits per second over many kilometers of a single optical fiber. Seven
months later NEC Corporation doubled the record, demonstrating speeds 1,000 times
those used on commercial long-distance networks. "These so-called hero
experiments are carefully orchestrated," points out Rajiv Ramaswami, manager of
optical network systems for the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center. "If you add
a kilometer of fiber or change the temperature of the room by 10 degrees, they
probably wouldn't work. But they demonstrate what is possible." To demonstrate
what is practical, major telephone companies have formed four alliances, each of
which is building its own experimental network.

<P>All four are pursuing the same clever idea to get around the speed limit
physics imposes on standard optical networks, which encode data in pulses of
laser light and dispatch them through wires made of glass. Very fast data rates
require very short pulses, which tend to smear into one another as they travel
through kilometers of fiber. Electronic devices staggered along the path can
clean up the signal, but they are expensive and can work on at most 50 billion
bits per second.

<P>To go faster, researchers have borrowed a trick from radio: they transmit many
signals simultaneously over a single fiber by encoding them in different
wavelengths, or channels. Commercial devices that use this technique, known as
<A HREF="http://www.research.ibm.com/wdm/"> wavelength division multiplexing</A> (WDM), can already boost the capacity of
existing fiber 20-fold. NEC's hero experiment demonstrated 132 channels, each
conveying a full load to 20 billion bits per second--all told, enough speed to
carry roughly 40 million telephone calls at once.

<P>"I doubt that more than 32 [channels] will be commercially practical for some
time," Ramaswami says. But WDM has another strong advantage. By eliminating the
need for electronic-signal cleaners, it opens the door to networks that switch
light signals directly, without converting them to electronic form [see
"All-Optical Networks," by Vincent W. S. Chan; <I>Scientific American</I>,
September 1995]. "Such networks don't care what bit rate or [encoding technique]
you send through them," Ramaswami notes. That makes them much cheaper to upgrade.
Over time, estimates Joseph Berthold, who leads Bellcore's work on a test-bed
project called MONET, "WDM could save [telephone companies] 35 percent of their
capital costs, or about $100 million, in high-demand regions."

<P>The telephone industry has remained skeptical of all-optical networks, because
optical switches are still expensive and unstable, and they offer no easy way to
spot and fix traffic jams. But that is changing swiftly. IBM has built prototype
optical switches using photolithography, the process that made microchips so
inexpensive. NTT has developed a device that could allow engineers building a
32-channel system to use just one stable, high-power laser and 32 filters instead
of 32 tunable lasers. And Rodney C. Alferness of Lucent Technologies predicts
that by February, MONET will be running--and monitoring--a small, all-optical
local telephone exchange linked to AT&T's long-distance system.

<P>As the test beds begin to prove WDM networks feasible, telephone company
executives will have to judge whether they are wise. If a single glass fiber can
carry all the voice, fax, video and data traffic for a large corporation yet
costs little more than today's high-speed Internet connections, how much will
they be able to charge for telephone service? Peter Cochrane of BT Laboratories
in Ipswich, England, predicts that "photonics will transform the telecoms
industry by effectively making bandwidth free and distance irrelevant." Joel
Birnbaum, director of Hewlett-Packard Laboratories, expects that this will
relegate telephone companies to the role of digital utilities. "You will buy
computing like you now buy water or power," he says.

<P>Others, such as industry analyst Francis McInerney, believe the double-time
march of technology has already doomed them to fall behind. AT&T and its ilk, he
claims, "are already dead. When individuals have [megabits per second of
bandwidth], telephone service should cost about three cents a month." Having
discovered how to offer high-bandwidth service, telephone companies may now need
to invent useful things to do with it, just to stay in business.

<CENTER><H2> MILO MEDIN</H2>

<B>Do Try This @Home</B></center>


<P>Outside, a chilly rain is pelting Silicon Valley on a miserable gray afternoon.
Inside, comfortably ensconced in a fake living room at Home-or, technically,
<A HREF="http://www.home.net/">@Home</A>-my colleague Wayt Gibbs and I are basking in the glow of a 33-inch, $5,000
Mitsubishi monitor. Officially, I have come to interview <A HRED="http://www.home.net/about/bios/exec_MM.html">Milo Medin</A>, @Home's vice
president of networking and Silicon Valley's genius of the moment. Unofficially,
we've both come to see whether one of the first Internet services delivered by
television cable, rather than by telephone line, is all it's cracked up to be.

<P>@Home was founded on an alluring premise. Cable television systems are broadband:
they convey signals occupying a wide piece of the radio-frequency spectrum. They
are in effect "fat pipes" that can carry data at up to 10 million bits per
second. This capability-with a fair amount of supporting hardware--could make
them a much better medium for connecting to the Internet than the narrowband
telephone network, which by comparison is a bunch of soda straws, with data
poking along at several thousand, or at most tens of thousands, of bits per
second.

<P>Although @Home is only two years old, its bold plan has already fired the
imagination of a number of technology writers, who have portrayed the company's
quest in David and Goliath terms. Besides @Home, David consists of several
relative upstarts in the Internet business, such as <A HREF="http://home.mcom.com/comprod/about_netscape.html">Netscape Communications Corporation</A> and the three cable television operators that own much of @Home:
<A HREF="http://www.tcinc.com/">Tele-Communications, Inc.(TCI)</A>, <A HREF="http://www.tcinc.com/">Comcast Corporation</A> and <A HREF="http://www.cox.com/">Cox Communications, Inc.</A>
Goliath consists of (what else?) <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft Corporation</A> and the regional telephone
companies, who argue that cable's apparent overwhelming speed advantage will
wither if many users flock to cable-Internet systems, gobbling up their fat
bandwidth.

<P>Moreover, the telephone people insist, several advanced telecommunications
technologies, successors to the integrated-services digital network (ISDN), will
narrow the gap in the near future. At present, ISDN service offers typically
56,000 bits per second at a cost of about $25 a month; Internet service adds
another $20 or so a month. (A commercial T1 line can transmit data at 1.544
million bits per second but, with corporate Internet access, costs in the
neighborhood of $2,500 per month.)

<P>Whether cable-Internet systems can avoid potentially fatal growing pains will
largely be determined by the ingenuity of Medin (pronounced meh-DEEN), a
33-year-old communications engineer. Regardless of whether Goliath keels over,
Medin may wind up influencing the Internet as much as anyone else in the near
future. It would be another in a string of achievements for the man that
technology writer <A HREF="http://www.empower.org/discovery/ggindex.html">George Gilder</A> called a "hard-core Unix Christian libertarian
netbender from outer space."

<P>Medin's office is a study in Silicon Valley spartan. On his desk is a Sun
Sparcstation 20 and towering heaps of paper. There's a small round table, a tall
but empty bookcase and 10 black mugs, all of them containing black coffee in
various amounts and vintages. On the table is a partly disassembled cable modem.
Exuding technical know-how in a striped oxford shirt, blue jeans, white leather
sneakers and a pager, Medin holds forth on @Home's system. Words tumble out at a
remarkable rate, as his eyebrows fly up and down, his eyes widen and almost seem
to bug out, and his arms and hands jab and wave.

<P>"He can talk about technology for a whole evening and never tire of it," warns
Jay A. Rolls, director of multimedia technology for Cox. What sets him apart,
Rolls adds, is "an ability to communicate" and "vision. He can look at a
technology and see right away where he can take it."

</tr></table>

<P>Medin learned early what it was like to face a difficult situation. When he was
five years old, his father, a Serbian immigrant who farmed eight hectares of
grapes in Fresno, Calif., died of a heart attack. No one else in the
family--Milo, his four-year-old sister, Mary Ann, and his mother, Stella--spoke
English. His mother could not drive a car and knew nothing about farming or
finances. "When I went to kindergarten, I didn't understand a word the teacher
was saying," Medin recalls. "My sister, my mom and I went through my kindergarten
workbooks together, learning about [English] words." His mother subsequently not
only learned how to run the farm but increased its output.

<P>Medin read voraciously, especially about science. An interest in technology
blossomed in high school, when his mother bought him an Apple II computer and a
300-bits-per-second modem. Class valedictorian, he went on to the University of
California at Berkeley and loved it. At the height of the nuclear freeze movement
of the early 1980s, an activist approached him and exclaimed, "Do you know that
Reagan wants to spend a trillion dollars on a defense buildup?" Medin's
incredulous response was, "Is that all?" The man's jaw dropped.

<P>But if Berkeley's leftists found Medin hard to believe, so, too, did the Federal
Bureau of Investigation. While at Berkeley, Medin worked part-time at Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory writing software that was used to design
solid-state lasers and to model nuclear weapons effects. The job required a
security clearance and therefore a background check by the FBI. Medin's more
liberal friends seemed to sail through the process, but apparently the bureau had
trouble accepting the existence, in the Berkeley student body, of a right-wing
conservative with strong religious beliefs. "Is this guy a plant? Is he a nut?"
is how Medin guesses their reaction. While Medin was being investigated, a man
approached him and tried to sell him a white powder. If it was a test, Medin
passed: he immediately had the man arrested by the campus police. He got his
clearance not long after.

<P>After college, Medin went to work at the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration Ames Research Center, where he found a hodge-podge of proprietary
data networks. His view was that the agency should abandon such networks in favor
of an open one that was compatible with any kind of computer. In those days, that
meant switching to a brand-new Defense Department creation known as the
Transmission Control Protocol/Internetworking Protocol--the foundation of today's
Internet. Medin became a tireless and well-informed evangelist for <A HREF="http://www.acc.org/am/acc96/itc/basic/intro2.html#tcpip">TCP/IP</A>, and
the good times rolled. "Being a nonconformist in the government can be a lot of
fun," he says, "because you're on a crusade against incompetence."

<P>A number of achievements and anecdotes burnished the Medin mystique. In 1988 he
shut down Scandinavian Internet connectivity (which ran through Ames at the time)
because an administrator in Finland refused to rein in a hacker who had invaded
Medin's network. Such stories had made a minor celebrity of Medin when, in 1995,
<A HREF="http://www.kpcb.com/">Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers</A>, one of the Valley's top venture capital firms,
came calling. Medin ignored them. "I thought it was a law firm," he explains. K-P
partner <A HREF="http://www.home.net/about/bios/board_JD.html">John Doerr</A> persisted and finally arranged a breakfast meeting with Medin,
at which Doerr and others made a pitch for @Home and asked Medin to be its
technical chief. Medin politely declined the offer, then went on to tell them why
their plan wouldn't work. "It's a nice idea, but it's overly simplistic," was the
gist of what he said. "The expression on their faces was like I ran over their
puppy," he recalls.

<P>It took Doerr two months, but at last he landed Medin, whose first order of
businesss was addressing the flaws in @Home's technical plan. Although he was a
data-networking legend, he only began learning about cable television while he
was being recruited for @Home. (He did not even have cable in his own home.) "You
mean you have all this fiber?" he remembers thinking. "And you don't digitize,
you AM modulate? Very weird."

<P>The main problem with @Home's original scheme was that it did not deal with
bottlenecks throughout the Internet that would render pointless @Home's fat pipes
to the home. The only way to ensure high data rates all the way from World Wide
Web site to viewer, Medin concluded, was to build a private, high-speed backbone
network and, most important, store frequently accessed pages closer to viewers in
large caches spread around the country.

<P>With the backbone and caching system largely in place, TCI began offering @Home's
service for $35 a month to its <A HREF="http://www.tcinc.com/Whats_Next/Internet_Services/e4b1b1.html">California customers</A> in Sunnyvale and Fremont last
September. At press time, Cox, TCI and Comcast were also about to introduce the
service to subscribers in Baltimore, Hartford, Orange County, California, and
Arlington Heights, Ill.

<P>"We want to show people how broadband is different," Medin says. While accessing
@Home's own content through its Web browser, screens refresh instantly. The
displayed pages are also huge, generated from as many as 50 times more bits as
conventional pages. On one side of the screen, reports on traffic, weather,
stocks or other subjects are updated at intervals as short as two minutes. In the
center of the screen, the main image seems almost frenetically alive, with smart
design, flashing graphics and dollops here and there of audio and video. The
overall experience compares to conventional Internet in the way water skiing
compares to the backstroke.

<P>But how about when the content isn't @Home's? During a break in the
demonstration, Gibbs, my co-worker, grabs the keyboard and calls up a few sites.
Some snap up instantly; others, particularly <A HREF="http://www.apple.com/">Apple Computer's</A> site, are slower
(Apple's site, however, is a notorious underperformer). An informal survey of
seven @Home customers by the <A HREF="http://www.examiner.com">
San Francisco Examiner</A> last October found that all
were happy with the service.

<P>Of course, speed alone won't guarantee @Home's success, not with other cable
mavens readying high-speed services of their own. <A HREF="http://www.excalibur-group.com/">Excalibur</A>, a joint venture of
Time-Warner Cable and Time, Inc., is offering its broadband Roadrunner service in
Akron and Canton, Ohio, and in Binghamton, N.Y. Like the pesky Finnish hacker,
though, the competition will find Medin a formidable adversary. What else would
you expect of a man who peppers conversations with allusions to nuclear weapons
and whose war cry, dating to his NASA Ames days, is: "If you are willing to bet
your job on your beliefs, you can go a long way."

will be visible for more than four months in the morning sky (before perihelion) and evening sky (after perihelion). 
The farther north of the equator one is, the better the comet can be seen.
<p>

<I>by Shawn Carlson</I>
<P>On March 9, beginning 41 minutes after midnight Universal Time, a few hardy
souls willing to brave the Siberian winter will witness a total eclipse of the
sun. As the lunar shadow rushes northward across the subzero landscape, intrepid
observers will see, in addition to the usual spectacular solar corona, a streak
of light painting the darkened sky. Comet Hale-Bopp (known to astronomers as
C/1995 O1), predicted to be the brightest comet in more than two decades, will be
just 22 days away from perihelion and only 13 days short of its closest approach
to the earth. Its brilliantly illuminated tails should produce a dazzling
display.

<P>If a trek to subarctic Siberia doesn't fit your plans, don't worry. Hale-Bopp
promises sensational views from anywhere on the planet. It also offers amateurs a
chance to contribute to come-tary research: the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for
Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass., is coordinating a global net of observers, and
anyone can participate.

<P>Astronomers are agog over Hale-Bopp because its nucleus seems particularly
active. A cometary nucleus is a fluffy ball of ice and rock whose surface
evaporates as the wanderer nears the sun. The resulting streams of dust and gas
make up the comet's tails. (The glowing dust traces a curved path; ionized gas
travels in a straight line away from the sun.) Hale-Bopp's nucleus first began
spurting out visible jets of debris as it passed the orbit of Jupiter, roughly
seven astronomical units from the sun (1 AU is the average distance from the sun
to the earth, or about 150 million kilometers). Experienced naked-eye observers
have been watching Hale-Bopp since May 1996 (most comets are visible to the
unaided eye only a few months before perihelion), and the rest of us should be
able to see it starting this month.

<P>A comet's tails (one dust, the other gas) reveal some of its most intimate
secrets of composition and structure. They also give earthbound watchers a fine
traveling laboratory to chart the solar wind. Tails are sometimes decorated with
feathery features that flow outward under the solar wind's influence. Comet
Kohoutek delighted astronomers in 1974 with at least two prominent examples of
these skirting disturbances.

<P>Any amateur can record these and other features of the comet's tails. First,
you'll need a good star atlas that maps stars in terms of right ascension and
declination. (Norton's 2000.0 Star Atlas and Reference Handbook, 18th edition, by
Ian Ridpath, is probably best for this purpose.) You'll also need a drafting
compass and a <A HREF="0197amsci2.html">large bow-shaped angular scale.</A> The bow, made from a flexible meter
stick or yardstick and a long piece of scrap wood, will let you locate the tails'
features to about 0.1 degree of arc.

<P>Sketch the tails directly on the appropriate page of the star atlas (or on a
good photocopy). Locate the comet's head by measuring the angular separation
between the head and the three nearest stars in the atlas. Celestial maps mark
the positions of stars in terms of declination and right ascension; to convert
from angles to distance on the page, note that one hour of right ascension equals
15 degrees at the celestial equator. Elsewhere in the sky, divide the distance at
the equator by the cosine of the declination.

<P>For each measurement, set the compass to the appropriate opening and scribe a
small arc through where you expect the head to be. The precise location of the
head is where the arcs intersect. Follow the same procedure to mark all the other
major features in the tails and then fill in the finer details. Use a telescope
or binoculars for this part. By carrying out this procedure every clear night,
you can document the evolution of the tails.

<P>The comet's fuzzy head, or coma, also changes over time in size, brightness
and degree of condensation. The best way to measure its size is to use an
eyepiece with a calibrated scale etched into the lens. They're a bit pricey, but
for accuracy they can't be beat. Check out the micro guide eyepiece from
Celestron in Torrance, Calif.; call (800) 237-0600 or (310) 328-9560 to find a
local dealer-mine sells the eyepiece for $189.

<P>Those with more limited resources can use a less direct method to measure
angular size. Center a telescopic sight on the coma and let the earth's rotation
carry the comet across the field of view. Rotate the sight's crosshairs so that
the comet drifts straight along the horizontal line, then count how many seconds
it takes the coma to pass completely across the vertical crosshair. If you know
the comet's declination (from position measurements with the star atlas), the
width of the coma in minutes of arc is simply one quarter the cosine of the
declination times the number of seconds. Repeat the measurement at least three
times and average the results.

<P>With a small telescope and a little practice, you can also estimate the
comet's brightness, or visual magnitude, by comparing it with stars of known
magnitude. Put the comet in sharp focus using a low-magnification eyepiece (no
more than 2 magnification per centimeter of telescope aperture) and commit its
image to memory. Point your telescope to a nearby star of known magnitude and
defocus the image until the star appears the same size as did the comet. Then
mentally compare the brightness of the defocused star and the comet. Find one
star just slightly dimmer than the comet and another just slightly
brighter-recalling that smaller magnitudes mean brighter stars-and you should be
able to estimate where the comet's brightness falls in the interval between them.
For more information about the magnitude scale, consult any basic astronomy text.

<P>There are a few cautions to observe when estimating magnitudes. The atmosphere
absorbs much more light when a star--or comet--is close to the horizon, so if the
comet is at an elevation of less than 30 degrees, compare it only with stars that
are at about the same elevation. Don't use red stars for comparison, because your
eyes aren't very sensitive to red. If your catalogue lists a star as type K, M, R
or N, or if the listing for V-B (visible-minus-blue) magnitude exceeds 1.0, find
a bluer star. You will probably find it useful to practice this technique by
estimating the brightness of stars of known magnitude. Experienced observers can
achieve a precision of 0.1 or 0.2 magnitude.

<P>To find out more about observing comets or to learn how to contribute your
observations, contact the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics at
<A HREF="mailto:icq@cfa.harvard.edu">icq@cfa.harvard.edu</A>, or visit their <A HREF="http://cfa-www.

Astrophysical Observatory, 60 Garden St., Cambridge, MA 02138. I gratefully
acknowledge informative conversations with Dan Green. You can purchase the
center's newly published Guide to Observing Comets, the definitive resource on
the subject, by sending $15, payable to International Comet Quarterly, to the
same address. And do contribute your observations. Information is useless if it
is not shared.

<P>Either you are already old, or the odds are better than even that you will become
old. This statistic became true only 40 years ago. Aging is an artifact of a
highly developed civilization. For more than 99.9 percent of the time that human
beings have inhabited this planet, life expectancy at birth has been no more than
30 or 40 years. It is only after we learned how to avoid animal predators,
massive homicides, starvation, most causes of accidents and infectious diseases
that it has become possible for a substantial portion of the population of
developed nations to grow old.

<P>Although the desire for long life or even immortality has been a common theme in
human thought throughout recorded history, it is just in the past 20 years or so
that biogerontology-the biology of aging-has become an important area of interest
to both the scientic community and the public at large. Earlier neglect of
biogerontology was motivated in significant part by ageism-negative stereotypes
about old people-even among ostensibly objective scientists. The potential
political, social and economic impact of large numbers of older persons, however,
has galvanized studies of how people and animals age.

<P>Aging is a complex process, but its foundation is simple: Soon after animals
reach sexual maturity and live long enough to raise progeny to the stage of
independence-thereby ensuring the survival of the species-the forces of natural
selection diminish. The energy that organisms expend is better directed toward
reproductive success than toward greater individual longevity. Eventually, the
molecular disorder that occurs outpaces a body's usual repair mechanisms, and
aging takes place.

<P>The complexity of the topic has not been well served by many books written about
aging for the layperson. These texts have, with only one or two exceptions, been
authored by reporters who have interviewed a few biogerontologists or by
biomedical scientists who have an interest in aging but neither strong
professional qualifications nor a solid commitment to the field. <I>The Clock of
Ages</I> and <I>Reversing Human Aging fall</I> into the latter category. Lacking a full
grasp of the complexities of biogerontology, nonprofessionals frequently are
unaware of its many pitfalls and may ignore alternatives to hypotheses that they
present as fact.

<P>John J. Medina, a molecular biologist, devotes about a third of <I>The Clock of Ages</I>
to a course on fundamental biology. The primer is illustrated with many diagrams
and drawings such as those typically found in an introductory biology text; this
background may be interesting to some readers, but it is not directly concerned
with aging. The most relevant material is a catalogue of changes that occur with
age in major organ systems. Medina tells us that a particular organ
"deteriorates," "secretes less," "declines," "weakens," "incurs losses" or "has
an alteration" in its function. But most of us already know that much about
aging. What we want to know is why these changes occur, and that question is
substantially neglected. Furthermore, some of the items on the list are simply
wrong: for instance, cardiac function does not decrease with age in healthy
subjects.

<P>Another significant proportion of the book goes to vignettes, often appearing at
the beginning of chapters, that describe the aging of such people as Florence
Nightingale, Jane Austen, Napolon Bonaparte, Giovanni Casanova, Ludwig van
Beethoven and Billy the Kid, along with others whose names the reader may or may
not recognize. Each vignette is intended to illustrate a scientific point, but
the result is more often contrived than informative.

<P>Conceptual errors abound: the author does not distinguish, for example, between
the effects of aging and those of disease. He also overlooks the importance of
the difference between aging and longevity determination-the former concerns
itself with physical decline, the latter with mortality. More crucially, Medina
misses the distinction between individual and population immortality in
microorganisms, promulgating the mistaken belief that there exist immortal
unicellular forms. "Immortal" strains of cells continue dividing forever, but the
individual cells die just as surely as you or I will. Cell death is an essential
process in the early development of complex organisms like ourselves, but it is
not a major factor in aging.

<P>Finally, there is no "clock of ages." There is no evidence for a biological
mechanism that measures time. Cells may contain mechanisms that tally events such
as cell division, but they do not record the passage of time according to clock
or calendar. Most biogerontologists agree not only that cells must contain
multiple biological event counters but also that these counters determine an
organism's maximum potential life span, not the random misadventures of
age-related change. In <I>Reversing Human Aging</I>, Michael Fossel, originally a
neurobiologist, takes speculation about molecular event counting to an extreme.
He focuses on the important, recent discovery of a mechanism that appears to
limit the number of times a cell can reproduce; he suggests that further
understanding and manipulation of this mechanism might allow us to increase our
longevity significantly.

<P>The scientific story that underpins Fossel's speculations starts 35 years ago at
the Wistar Institute of Anatomy and Biology in Philadelphia, when Paul S.
Moorhead and I showed that, contrary to the dogma then widely held in cell
biology, all cells are not potentially immortal. Cultures of normal human fetal
fibroblasts divide about 50 times and no more-eventually the last cells die, and
that is the end of the test-tube population. We found that only populations of
abnormal or cancerous cells are immortal. Until our discovery, biogerontologists
believed aging had nothing to do with events within individual cells.

<P>Since our findings were published, scientists have sought the molecular mechanism
that determines the replicative limit of normal human and animal cells. In the
past few years, many researchers have come to believe that the answer is in the
telomere, a stretch of thousands of repeated nucleotide sequences of the form
TTAGGG (where T, A and G are chemical "letters" in the genetic code) that is
found at both ends of all 46 human chromosomes. At each cell division, some
telomere sequences are lost, until the shortened stretch triggers events that
cause the cell to stop dividing. Immortal cells produce an enzyme called
telomerase, which adds new sequences to the chromosome each time the cell
divides, thus maintaining a constant telomere length. Recently sensitive assays
have found that much smaller amounts of telomerase are also present in cells from
embryos and in tissues whose cells divide regularly.

<P>This exciting story has persuaded Fossel that science has discovered the
mechanism that determines aging and that the molecular clock can soon be turned
back. I believe Fossel has overinterpreted this discovery, important as it is. I
also believe telomere shortening may tell us a great deal about ultimate limits
to the human life span but little about aging.

<P>I have always worried about the enormous power that humans will have if we ever
learn how either to tamper with the aging process or to extend our longevity-it
is unclear whether people could cope with the psychological, economic, medical
and cultural changes that would accompany vastly extended life spans, even should
they prove physiologically possible. Fossel gives a thoughtful overview of his
conviction that humans will benefit by possessing this awesome capability. Many
other writers and philosophers disagree. Although aging and death put an end to
the lives of good citizens, they also make finite the lives of tyrants, murderers
and a broad spectrum of other undesirables. Much of the continuing massive
destruction of this planet and the consequent ills that this destruction produces
for humans can be traced to overpopulation, a phenomenon that appears to show no
sign of abating. Extending the life of a population that already strains global
resources is, in the view of many, unconscionable.

<P>If the price to be paid for the beneficial results of aging and death is its
universal applicability, we should all pay that price-as we always have.

Review by <A HREF="#author">Paul Wallich</A>

<P><B>HAL's Legacy: 2001's Computer 
as Dream and Reality</B>
<BR>EDITED BY DAVID G. STORK
<BR>Foreword by Arthur C. Clarke
<BR><A HREF="http://www-mitpress.mit.edu/">MIT Press</A>, 1997 ($22.50)</center>


<P>"I became operational at the HAL Plant in Urbana, Ill., on January 12, 1997," the
computer HAL tells his interlocutors in Arthur C. Clarke's 1968 novel, <I>2001: A
Space Odyssey</I>. That day is upon us, but nothing resembling an intelligent
computer is ready to be switched on in Urbana or anywhere else. Clarke was in
many respects an acute visionary: he predicted the existence of communications
satellites-and their effect as cultural cement mixers-so accurately that life may
well have imitated art. But artificial intelligence (AI) remains the same "four
to 400 years" away that the field's namer, John McCarthy, estimated some 30 years
ago.

<P>Many computer scientists have given up entirely on AI, and <I>HAL's Legacy</I>--both in
its text and as an object lesson-may help lay readers understand why.
Machine--intelligence researcher David G. Stork has enlisted a dozen computer
scientists (plus a mathematician and a philosopher) to consider, at heart, a
question he was asked at a dinner party: "How realistic was HAL?" The authors
tackle a variety of topics in hardware, software and cognitive science with a
firm conviction that they are discussing the building blocks of an intelligent
machine like HAL, but, tellingly, no underlying coherence emerges. Much as the
expert systems of the 1980s were full of "brittle" knowledge that proved useless
outside narrowly specialized applications, so human experts in supercomputer
design, fault tolerance or computer chess seem unable to step outside the
boundaries of their disciplines.

<P>A discussion of the subnanosecond "clock speeds" (the time necessary to carry out
each operation) that are potentially possible using gallium arsenide integrated
circuits offers a prime example. Ultrafast circuits may be useful for the kind of
supercomputing that tackles complex physical simulations, such as predicting
weather or modeling the interior of a hydrogen bomb, but it is not at all clear
that this kind of computing has anything to do with intelligence and
self-awareness as cognitive scientists are beginning to understand it. Similarly,
the state of the art of fault tolerance for computer hardware and software is
only minimally relevant to the story of HAL's "mental" breakdown in <I>2001</I>; Clarke
attributed HAL's troubles to a fundamental and quite emotional contradiction in
its duties to its crew and to its mission.

<P>Even those contributors who recognize that standard microchips and operating
systems are unlikely to yield intelligence can succumb to technological tunnel
vision. Inventor Raymond Kurzweil makes the remarkable assertion that increases
in the resolution of brain-imaging technology will shortly enable researchers to
map human neurons into silicon. That bold leap is a little like imagining that a
simultaneous readout of the speedometers in all the cars on Boston's streets
would let you predict the results of its next mayoral election. So many aspects
of everyday life as depicted in 2001 have receded over the technological horizon
that it should come as no surprise that even the most basic of HAL's
abilities-carrying out simple conversation-is beyond modern computers. They
cannot reliably convert sounds to an internal representation of meaning; they
cannot even generate naturally inected speech. Machines still lack the enormous,
implicit base of knowledge about the world and the intuitive understandings of
emotion or belief most people take for granted.

<P>Joseph P. Olive of Bell Laboratories does a good job of explaining the
complexities underlying effective speech synthesis. Not only must a computer know
what it is saying to produce the proper inections, but it must also mimic the
vagaries of a human vocal tract with surprising precision. Visual cues, too, are
important in conveying meaning. Olive and his colleagues have found that
displaying an animated, expressive face synchronized with the voice can make the
result significantly more intelligible. "If HAL had had a real face, rather than
one large eye," he asks, "would it have been so easy to kill him?"

<P>There are always pitfalls in reading too much into the technology or psychology
of a fictional entity. Arguments over what kind of being HAL was are ultimately
even less resolvable than questions of the true intentions of Clarke or Stanley
Kubrick (who collaborated on the screenplay in addition to directing the movie
version of <I>2001</I>). Murray S. Campbell of the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center
delivers an interesting discussion on the way that human chess-playing styles
differ from computer ones. He goes astray, however, by indulging in a tediously
detailed examination of the 1913 chess match between two undistinguished German
tournament players from which the closing moves shown in the film were taken.

<P>Perhaps a dark side of HAL's legacy is to have fixed an anthropomorphic view of
artificial intelligence so firmly in the minds of a generation of researchers
that one of them would take such a throwaway detail so seriously. During the
1980s, those anthropomorphic visions found some kind of fruition in computer
programs that demonstrated near-human and occasionally superhuman autonomous
abilities in a range of fields from medical diagnosis to ore prospecting or
financial analysis.

<P>But these idiot savants did not show even the slightest signs of achieving
general competence. In the subsequent AI winter-brought on by the end of a
military research spree as well as the inevitable collision between venture
capital and reality-only the mechanical cockroaches survived. Researchers scaled
back their ambitions and aimed at achieving the cognitive and survival skills of
a lobster or a cricket rather than a virtuoso surgeon or an ace fighter pilot.

<P>If mechanical evolution proceeds a million times faster than its natural
predecessor, we might expect the emergence of a digital dog in a century or two.
Some stalwarts of the AI establishment, however, are calling for a reevaluation
of the essential goal of artificial-intelligence research. They contend that
trying to create a thinking machine-for the time being, at least-is like asking
the Wright brothers for an artificial bird, complete with feathers and flapping
wings. Patrick  Hayes of the Beckman Institute (who did not contribute to <I>HAL's
Legacy</I>) has coined the term "cognitive prosthesis" to embrace a range of software
tools, including automated memory aids and job-scheduling systems, that help
people think more effectively, much as cars help them to move from place to place
or hydraulic presses help them to bend and form metal.

<P>No one expects to get into a car and sleep at the wheel while being conveyed
automatically to the correct destination, and perhaps no one should expect a
computer program to diagnose patients infallibly or to command a major battle.
But even now software written using the techniques developed by AI researchers
reminds doctors of possibilities they might have missed or schedules the
transport aircraft that deliver supplies to combatants in far-off lands. The
programs are nothing like HAL, but without people working toward the same vision
expressed by Clarke and Kubrick, even these limited intellectual tools would not
exist.

offers a probing inquiry into the violent behavior etched into the nature of
humans and chimpanzees-especially males of the species. The authors lead the

anthropological reconstructions; they even offer lessons from the peacemaking
behavioral adaptations of bonobo chimps. The science is clearly told, the writing

origin and the development of the basic biochemical pathways-are shrouded in
mystery. Michael J. Behe holds that evolutionary theory will never solve the
mystery, because some of the components are "irreducibly complex" and so must be
the product of "intelligent design"-maybe God's, maybe not. It is an old

lavishly illustrated edition. The text seems more accessible than before, and it
includes a lively new chapter on the possibility of time travel, along with

<H2>A Bit of a Flutter</H2>

I suppose my view of history tends away from the orderly and more toward the
chaotic, in the sense of that much overused phrase from chaos theory about the
movement of a butterfly's wing in China causing storms on the other side of the
world. So, not to be outdone, I decided to have a go at reproducing the butterfly
effect on the great web of knowledge across which I travel in these columns.

<P>That thought came at the sight of a giant cabbage white in a Lepidoptera
exhibit at the Natural History Museum in London, reminding me of the other great
natural history museum, the Smithsonian. Which owes its life to one Robert Dale
Owen. The two-term Democrat from Indiana almost single-handedly pushed through
Congress the 1846 bill accepting the Englishman James Smithson's bequest of $10
million and change (in today's money) that helped to set up the esteemed
institution.

<P>Owen's efforts also involved unraveling one of the shadier deals in American
financial history: most of Smithson's money, which had arrived in the U.S. a few
years before, was at the time in the dubious grip of a foundering real-estate
bank in Arkansas, into which the U.S. Treasury had thoughtlessly placed it for
safekeeping.

<P>Owen was a liberal thinker, the son of a famous British reformer who had
earlier started an unsuccessful utopian community in New Harmony, Ind. Well ahead
of his time, Owen championed the use of plank roads, women's rights, emancipation
and family planning. This last he espoused in a pamphlet in 1830. Subtitled "A
Brief and Plain Treatise on the Population Question" (which gives you a feel for
the cut of his jib), it advocated birth control by everybody and included three
examples of how to do it. Two years later much of Owen's text was lifted
(unacknowledged) for a wildly popular tract by a Dr. Charles Knowlton of Boston,
"The Fruits of Philosophy," which went into greater physiological detail.

<P>Forty years on (which is telling as to the speed of reform), Knowlton's work
was republished by activist Annie Besant in England, where it was judged obscene
and likely to pervert morals. Ms Besant conducted her own defense at the trial
and in doing so became the first woman to speak publicly about contraception. It
earned her a fine and a sentence. Undeterred, Besant took up larger causes:
Indian independence (she was president of the first Indian National Congress),
vegetarianism and comparative religion. This was some years after she'd broken
off a romantic interlude with another left-winger, a penniless nobody called
George Bernard Shaw, with whom Annie played piano duets at the regular meetings
of William Morris's Socialist League in London.

<P>Later Shaw would become fairly well known as the author of <I>Pygmalion</I>
and then world famous when it was remade as the Hollywood musical <I>My Fair
Lady</I>. It was a play all about talking proper (which Eliza Doolittle didn't,
you may recall) and featured a professor of elocution, Henry Higgins, whom Shaw
modeled on a real-life linguistic academic named Henry Sweet.

<P>In the 1880s Sweet was one of the inventors of the phonetic alphabet, stemming
from the contemporary craze for ancient languages kicked off by William Jones, a
Welsh judge in Calcutta. In 1786 Jones had revealed the extraordinary
similarities between the Indian language of Sanskrit and Greek. The revelation
revved up early 19th-century Romantic nationalistic Germans (who'd not long
before lost a war with the French and were going through a period of cultural
paranoia) because it gave them the idea that they might be able to trace their
linguistic roots back into the Indo-European mists of time, thus proving they had
a heritage at least as Paleolithic as anybody in Paris.

<P>This mania for reviving the nation's pride might have been why German graduate
students were also getting grants for such big-science projects as sending out
40,000 questionnaires to teachers all over the country asking them how local
dialect speakers pronounced the sentence "In winter the dry leaves fly through
the air." On the basis of such fundamental data, pronunciation atlases were
produced, and dialectology became respectable. So much so that at the University
of Jena, a guy called Edward Schwann even got the money to do a phonometric study
of zee French accent. Nice work if you can get it.

<P>Schwann was aided in his task by the eminent German physicist Ernst
Pringsheim. In 1876 Pringsheim was one of the science honchos visited by Franz
Boll, a researcher who was working on the process by which the human eye is able
to see in low light, thanks to the presence of a particular chemical. Or not, in
the case of its absence. The whole business of such deficiency was taken a stage
further by a sharp-eyed Dutch medical type, Christiaan Eijkman.

<P>Eijkman happened to be in Java with a Dutch hospital unit, sent there in 1886
to grapple with the problem of beriberi, a disease that was laying low large
numbers of colonial administrators and army people. He noticed some chickens
staggering about the hospital yard with symptoms not unlike those he was studying
in humans. But these were chickens, so he did nothing about it. Until one day the
chickens suddenly got better. What kind of fowl play was going on here?

<P>Turned out, the new cook at the hospital had decided that what was good enough
for the local Javanese workers was good enough for birds. So he had stopped
feeding the chickens gourmet leftovers from the table of the European medical
staff. Difference being in the rice. Europeans were given polished rice
("military rice"); locals and the chickens got the stuff with the hulls left on
("paddy"). Months of chicken-and-rice tests by Eijkman garnered an important
result: something in the rice hulls was curing the chickens. Or, to put it more
meaningfully, without this "something" the chickens got the staggers. So was that
why people did the same?

<P>A few years later, in England, Frederick Gowland Hopkins, an insurance broker
turned biochemist, observed that baby rats wouldn't grow, no matter what they
were fed, if their diet didn't include milk. He became convinced there was
something essential for health in normal food that wasn't protein, carbohydrate,
fat or salt. He labeled these mystery materials "accessory food factors" and went
on to share the 1929 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine with Eijkman, because
between them their work would lead to the discovery of what these accessories
actually were: vitamins. (In the case of the chickens, thiamine, vitamin B1.)

<P>Now, why all this made me think that the way the knowledge web works might
remind you distantly of chaos theory was because of what Hopkins had been doing
before he got into nutrition. He was able to work with pure proteins and their
role in nutrition once new techniques had been developed (at Guy's Hospital in
London, where Hopkins had trained) to analyze uric acid proteins in urine. And he
was interested in uric acid because his very first scientific project had been
with insects, and he had conjectured (wrongly, as it turned out) that uric acid
was involved in producing the white pigment of the wings of certain butterflies.

<BR>by <B>Philip Morrison</B>          

<H2>Doing the Poincar&eacute Shuffle</H2>

<P>Happy New Year! On 1 January 1997, at about 6 P.M. Eastern Standard Time,
Earth will come nearer to the sun than at any other time that year. The
elliptical orbit we all travel is no flattened figure but a near circle. The main
mark of its ellipticity is that off-center sun. The simplest Newtonian orbital
system comprises two bodies, like our sun and planet, free to move under mutual
gravity alone, with a unique result: once they begin to circle each other, their
orbit will remain for all time a closed ellipse.

<P>Planetary orbits are not all so orderly-or so boring?-as this closed ellipse.
Only for the case of two bodies does the eternally fixed ellipse work. For three
(or more) interacting bodies, we cannot in general predict for very long even the
overall shape of the orbits. How can such a difference appear between two bodies
and three? You can grasp why without mathematics, by an appeal to the mechanical
intuitions of our life on Earth.

<P>We know that planets are minute actors seen against the wide stage of their
spacious orbits. Take an example: heavy central sun; planet moving around it in a
big circle; and a third body, a small asteroid or comet, so low in mass that its
effect on the other two can almost always be ignored. Set the comet into orbit in
the same plane as the planetary circle, but not at all in a circular orbit. Put
it rather into a long, narrow ellipse, with the focus at the sun. The comet
rounds the sun close in, then goes far out-well past the circular orbit of the
planet-to return and repeat. The planet circles smoothly enough, inducing small
ripples in the comet's elliptical path. The comet must repeatedly cross the orbit
of the planet, although most times planet and comet will be far apart. But
sometime in a myriad of passages, a close encounter will take place.

<P>The gravitational force can easily rise a millionfold during an encounter
without any physical contact. Such a spike of force takes over the motion. The
comet will be pulled into quite a new orbit, first curving near the planet, to
depart with its direction and speed forever changed. The moving planet may give
energy to or take it away from the deflected com-et. Or the comet may be lost,
never to return, once it gains speed enough to escape the pull of the distant
sun. Plainly, no simple formula can predict such a delicately contingent outcome.

<P>I dub any long string of orbital encounters the "Poincar&eacute shuffle," after the
turn-of-the-century French mathematician Jules-Henri Poincar&eacute. He proved before
1900 that even the longest-standing record of punctuality cannot guarantee that
the best-tested almanac will hold up. For two bodies, all such misadventures are
forbidden, because there is no handy third party to broker some energy.
Prediction in the simple case can be perfect, secured by the few overall
conservation laws, such as that of energy. There are too few mechanical laws of
conservation for the general many-body problem.

<P>A calculation in the 1960s by three Russian mathematicians showed that a
planetary system will remain stable if it starts out closely resembling the
simplest case-of low-mass planets moving in co-planar, well-spaced and circular
orbits. Our real system does not lie in the narrow band of proved gravitational
tranquillity, although it is not far from it.

<P>The most likely popular explanation for our endurance is evolutionary. A real
survivor, our solar system has combed itself out over four billion years into the
present near-stable state. No one can now say for sure what further
simplification, if any, is to come. Add another familiar idea: resonance.
Repetitive but distant encounters between orbiters may add up sequentially until
small effects grow large, just as the march of soldiers across a suspension
bridge can set it swinging. In a system of many orbiting bodies, such fine-tuned
patterns of motion are possible even by chance. They offer a wide opening to
change more gradual than the shuffle.

<P>The lesson is plain. Most systems with multiple, unkempt orbits have finite
lives, if long ones. Lighter bodies cross at their own risk the rights-of-way of
any much heavier ones. The clever orbit designers at the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory have long known this, as they practice their own art of planetary
billiards. Gravitationally caroming by human design, the probe Galileo skittered
past Earth (with an encore) and then by Venus, ending right on station by looping
within Jupiter's sway.

<P>Many rocks among the ejecta from old cratering impacts on planet surfaces are
now shuffling from one occupied orbit to another, through millions of orbit
crossings. That natural Poincar&eacute shuffle has already brought a few celebrated
samples from Mars to Earth, and perhaps some went the other way once. In early
times the pull of the big planets strongly stirred the light, icy comets either
to merger or banishment. A few of the trillion exiled comets return every year,
dangerously crossing orbits again, in response to random attraction from galactic
matter far outside our system. They, too, face eventual capture or exile.

<P>The only satisfying means of study in deep time has become trial by computer.
Simulate gravitational forces accurately among the many bodies, and their
interactions play out step by step, over orbits galore. One solar system can
hardly show how others must behave, for diversity is apt to be their most common
property. Generous dynamical friends have shown me some recent experimental
printouts of a special three-body case-two planets of adequate mass orbiting too
near their sun in closely spaced concentric circles. They execute their more or
less unchanging orbits through long, long runs, tens of simulated "millennia."
Then, all in one bad season, each planet abandons its accustomed path to move a
considerable way toward the other, until both withdraw to their original
neighborhoods.

<P>Somewhat later the attraction becomes irresistible; the two draw speedily
together and then merge. In another trial one of the errant pair is ejected, to
be flung far away. Perhaps this is a clue to the real history of one extrasolar
near-Jupiter we have newly found, circling alone, surprisingly close to its own
sun?

<P>Our computer-armed dynamicists currently report rather gloomy expectations
close at home. The grand experiential almanac is growing, but for billions of
years ahead it is hardly conclusive. Few orbital radii within our sun's system
remain vacant where additional planets could permanently circle. Most likely many
of the sun's earlier planets, a dozen or two more once orbiting right among us,
crossed orbits to merge or fly off. Familiar Mercury now shows signs of orbital
instability hard to disregard. It may well over the long term become the next
planet to depart!

<P>In the meantime, instability may bring beauty, not disaster. Spring 1997
offers a strong hope of seeing one such errant body, Comet Hale-Bopp, named after
the two experienced observers who found it independently in 1995. If we luck out,
it may grow as bright to the unaided eye as any star, a sight unmatched for a
generation [see <A HREF="0197amsci.html">"The Amateur Scientist," </A>]. U.S. sky
watchers can find it in the northwest, a quarter of the way up from the horizon
an hour or so after dusk, on any evening from a week before to a week after April
1. No kidding.

<BR>Roughly once a second, a subatomic particle enters the earth's atmosphere carrying as much energy as a well-thrown rock. Somewhere in the universe, that fact implies, there are forces that can impart to a single proton 100 million times the energy achievable by the most powerful earthbound accelerators. Where and how?

<P>Those questions have occupied physicists since <A HREF="http://www.physics.adelaide.edu.au/astrophysics/cr.html">cosmic rays</A> were first discovered in 1912 (although the entities in question are now known to be particles, the name "ray" persists). The <A HREF="http://pegasus.phast.umass.edu/a100/handouts/ism.html">interstellar medium</A> contains atomic nuclei of every element in the periodic table, all moving under the influence of electrical and magnetic fields. Without the screening effect of the earth's atmosphere, cosmic rays would pose a significant health threat; indeed, people living in mountainous regions or making frequent airplane trips pick up a measurable extra radiation dose.

Perhaps the most remarkable feature of this radiation is that investigators have
not yet found a natural end to the cosmic-ray spectrum. Most well-known sources
of charged particles--such as the sun, with its <A
HREF="http://utd500.utdallas.edu/~earle/swind.html">solar wind</A>--have a
characteristic energy limit; they simply do not produce particles with energies
above this limit. In contrast, cosmic rays appear, albeit in decreasing numbers,
at energies as high as astrophysicists can measure. The data run out at levels
around 300 billion times the rest-mass energy of a proton because there is at
present no detector large enough to sample the very low number of incoming
particles predicted.

<P>Nevertheless, evidence of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays has been seen at
intervals of several years as particles hitting the atmosphere create myriad
secondary particles (which are easier to detect). On October 15, 1991, for
example, a cosmic-ray observatory in the Utah desert registered a <A
HREF="http://www.physics.adelaide.edu.au/astrophysics/high.html">shower of
secondary particles</A> from a 50-joule (3 x 10<SUP>20</SUP> electron volts)
cosmic ray. Although the cosmic-ray flux decreases with higher energy, this
decline levels off somewhat above about 10<SUP>16</SUP> eV, suggesting that the
mechanisms responsible for ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays are different from those
for rays of more moderate energy.

<P>In 1960 Bernard Peters of the Tata Institute in Bombay suggested that
lower-energy cosmic rays are produced predominantly inside our own galaxy,
whereas those of higher energy come from more distant sources. One reason to
think so is that a cosmic-ray proton carrying more than 10<SUP>19</SUP> eV, for
example, would not be deflected significantly by any of the <A
HREF="http://www.kingsu.ab.ca/~brian/astro/chp8.htm">magnetic fields</A>
typically generated by a galaxy, so it would travel more or less straight. If
such particles came from inside our galaxy, we might expect to see different
numbers coming from various directions because the galaxy is not arranged
symmetrically around us. Instead the distribution is essentially isotropic, as is
that of the lower-energy rays, whose directions are scattered.

<P><B><A NAME="1">Supernova Pumps</A></B>

<P>Such tenuous inferences reveal how little is known for certain about the
origin of cosmic rays. Astrophysicists have plausible models for how they might
be produced but no definitive answers. This state of affairs may be the result of
the almost unimaginable difference between conditions on the earth and in the
regions where cosmic rays are born. The <A
HREF="http://lsnt7.lightspeed.net/astronomy/ismnotes/ismnotes.html">space between
the stars</A> contains only about one atom per cubic centimeter, a far lower
density than the best artificial vacuums we can create. Furthermore, these
volumes are filled with vast electrical and magnetic fields, intimately connected
to a diffuse population of charged particles even less numerous than the neutral
atoms.

<P>This environment is far from the peaceful place one might expect: the low
densities allow electrical and magnetic forces to operate over large distances
and timescales in a manner that would be quickly damped out in material of
terrestrial densities. Galactic space is therefore filled with an energetic and
<A HREF="http://aps.org/BAPSDPP96/abs/S660004.html">turbulent plasma of partially
ionized gas</A> in a state of violent activity. The motion is often hard to
observe on human timescales because astronomical distances are so large;
nevertheless, those same distances allow even moderate forces to achieve
impressive results. A particle might zip through a terrestrial accelerator in a
few microseconds, but it could spend years or even millennia in the accelerator's
cosmic counterpart. (The timescales are further complicated by the strange,
relativity-distorted framework that ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays inhabit. If we
could observe such a particle for 10,000 years, that period would correspond to
only a single second as far as the particle is concerned.)

<P>Astronomers have long speculated that the bulk of galactic cosmic rays--those
with energies below about 10<SUP>16</SUP> eV--originate with <A
HREF="http://legacy.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/snr.html">supernovae</A>. A compelling
reason for this theory is that the power required to maintain the observed supply
of cosmic-ray nuclei in our Milky Way galaxy is only slightly less than the
average kinetic energy delivered to the galactic medium by the three supernova
explosions that occur every century. There are few, if any, other sources of this
amount of power in our galaxy.

<P>When a massive star collapses, the outer parts of the star explode at speeds
of up to 10,000 kilometers per second and more. A similar amount of energy is
released when a <A
HREF="http://www.astro.umd.edu/~miller/astr100/evolution/wdwarf.html">white
dwarf</A> star undergoes complete disintegration in a thermonuclear detonation.
In both types of supernovae the ejected matter expands at supersonic velocities,
driving a strong shock into the surrounding medium. Such shocks are expected to
accelerate nuclei from the material they pass through, turning them into cosmic
rays. Because cosmic rays are charged, they follow complicated paths through <A
HREF="http://aps.org/BAPSMAY96/abs/S1335004.html">interstellar magnetic
fields</A>. As a result, their directions as observed from the earth yield no
information about the location of their original source.

<P>By looking at the <A
HREF="http://www.jaeri.go.jp/~intro/H8/PHOTON/syncro.html">synchrotron
radiation</A> sometimes associated with supernova remnants, researchers have
found more direct evidence that supernovae can act as accelerators. Synchrotron
radiation is characteristic of high-energy electrons moving in an intense
magnetic field of the kind that might act as a cosmic-ray accelerator, and the
presence of synchrotron x-rays in some supernova remnants suggests particularly
high energies. (In earthbound devices, synchrotron emission limits a particle's
energy because the emission rate increases as a particle goes faster; at some
point, the radiation bleeds energy out of an accelerating particle as fast as it
can be pumped in.) Recently the Japanese x-ray satellite <A
HREF="http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/asca/ascagof.html">Asca</A> made images
of the shell of Supernova 1006, which exploded 990 years ago. Unlike the
radiation from the interior of the remnant, the x-radiation from the shell has
the features characteristic of synchrotron radiation. Astrophysicists have
deduced that electrons are being accelerated there at up to 10<SUP>14</SUP> eV
(100 TeV).

<P>The <A HREF="http://cossc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cossc/EGRET.html">EGRET detector</A>
on the <A
HREF="http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cossc/descriptions/cgro.html">Compton Gamma
Ray Observatory</A> has also been used to study point sources of gamma rays
identified with supernova remnants. The observed intensities and spectra (up to a
billion electron volts) are consistent with an origin from the decay of particles
called neutral pions, which could be produced by cosmic rays from the exploding
star's remnants colliding with nearby interstellar gas. Interestingly, however,
searches made by the ground-based <A
HREF="http://egret.sao.arizona.edu/index.html">Whipple Observatory</A> for gamma
rays of much higher energies from some of the same remnants have not seen signals
at the levels that would be expected if the supernovae were accelerating
particles to 10<SUP>14</SUP> eV or more.

<P>A complementary method for testing the association of <A
HREF="http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/learning_center/museum/exploratorium/gamma_generation.html">high-energy
cosmic rays</A> with supernovae involves the elemental composition of cosmic-ray
nuclei. The size of the orbit of a charged particle in a magnetic field is
proportional to its total momentum per unit charge, so heavier nuclei have
greater total energy for a given orbit size. Any process that limits the particle
acceleration on the basis of orbit size (such as an accelerating region of
limited extent) will thus lead to an excess of heavier nuclei at high energies.

<P>Eventually we would like to be able to go further and look for elemental
signatures of acceleration in specific types of supernovae. For example, the
supernova of a white dwarf detonation would accelerate whatever nuclei populate
the local interstellar medium. A supernova that followed the collapse of a
massive star, in contrast, would accelerate the surrounding stellar wind, which
is characteristic of the outer layers of the progenitor star at earlier stages of
its evolution. In some cases, the wind could include an increased fraction of
helium, carbon or even heavier nuclei.

<P>The identity of high-energy cosmic rays is all but lost when they interact
with atoms in the earth's atmosphere and form a <A
HREF="http://ast.leeds.ac.uk/haverah/cr_showers.html">shower of secondary
particles</A>. Hence, to be absolutely sure of the nuclear composition,
measurements must be made before the cosmic rays reach dense atmosphere.
Unfortunately, to collect 100 cosmic rays of energies near 10<SUP>14</SUP> eV, a
10-square-meter detector would have to be in orbit for three years. Typical
exposures at present are more like the equivalent of one square meter for three
days.

<P>Researchers are attacking this problem with some ingenious experiments. For
example, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration has developed
techniques to loft large payloads (about three tons) with <A
HREF="http://www.wff.nasa.gov/~web/balloons.html">high-altitude balloons</A>
for many days. These <A
HREF="http://marge.phys.washington.edu/jacee/">experiments</A> cost a tiny
fraction of what an equivalent satellite detector would. The most successful
flights of this type have taken place in Antarctica, where the upper atmosphere
winds blow in an almost constant circle around the South Pole.

<P>A payload launched at McMurdo Sound on the coast of Antarctica will travel at
a nearly constant radius from the Pole and return eventually to near the launch
site. Some balloons have circled the continent for 10 days. One of us (Swordy) is
collaborating with <A
HREF="http://rainbow.uchicago.edu/physics/x_astro.html#MFCller">Dietrich
M&#252;ller</A> and <A
HREF="http://rainbow.uchicago.edu/physics/x_astro.html#PMeyer">Peter Meyer</A> of
the University of Chicago on a 10-square-meter detector that could measure heavy
cosmic rays of up to 10<SUP>15</SUP> eV on such a flight. There are efforts to
extend the exposure times to roughly 100 days with similar flights nearer the
equator.

<P>Studying even higher-energy cosmic rays--those produced by sources as yet
unknown--requires large ground-based detectors, which overcome the problem of low
flux by watching enormous effective areas for months or years. The information,
however, must be extracted from cascades of secondary particles--electrons, <A
HREF="http://alizarin.physics.wisc.edu/jacobsen/raven/mcnotes/mcnotes/node6.html">muons</A>
and gamma rays--initiated high in the atmosphere by an incoming cosmic-ray
nucleus. Such indirect methods can only suggest general features of the
composition of a cosmic ray on a statistical basis, rather than identifying the
atomic number of each incoming nucleus.

<P>At ground level, the millions of secondary particles unleashed by one cosmic
ray are spread over a radius of hundreds of meters. Because it is impractical to
blanket such a large area with detectors, the detectors typically sample these
air showers at a few hundred or so discrete locations.

<P>Technical improvements have enabled such devices to collect increasingly
sophisticated data sets, thus refining the conclusions we can draw from each
shower. For example, the CASA-MIA-DICE experiment in Utah, in which two of us
(Cronin and Swordy) are involved, measures the distributions of electrons and
muons at ground level. It also detects <A
HREF="http://dept.physics.upenn.edu/~www/balloon/cerenkov_radiation.html">Cerenkov
light</A> (a type of optical shock wave produced by particles moving faster than
the speed of light in their surrounding medium) generated by the shower particles
at various levels in the atmosphere. These data enable us to reconstruct the
shape of the shower more reliably and thus take a better guess at the energy and
identity of the cosmic ray that initiated it.

<P>The third one of us (Gaisser) is working with an array that measures showers
reaching the surface at the South Pole. This experiment works in conjunction with
<A HREF="http://dilbert.lbl.gov/www/amanda.html">AMANDA</A>, which detects
energetic muons produced in the same showers by observing Cerenkov radiation
produced deep in the ice cap. The primary goal of AMANDA is to catch traces of
neutrinos produced in cosmic accelerators, which may generate upward-streaming
showers after passing through the earth.

<P>In addition to gathering better data, researchers are also improving detailed
computer simulations that model how air showers develop. These simulations help
us to understand both the capabilities and the limitations of ground-based
measurements. The extension to higher energies of direct cosmic-ray detection
experiments, which allows both ground-based and airborne detectors to observe the
same kinds of cosmic rays, will also help calibrate our ground-based data.

<P><B><A NAME="3">Rare Giants</A></B>

<P>Cosmic rays with energies above 10<SUP>20</SUP> eV strike the earth's
atmosphere at a rate of only about one per square kilometer a year. As a result,
studying them requires an air-shower detector of truly gigantic proportions. In
addition to the 1991 event in Utah, particles with energies above 10<SUP>20</SUP>
eV have been seen by groups elsewhere in the U.S., in Akeno, Japan, in <A
HREF="http://ast.leeds.ac.uk/haverah/hav.html">Haverah Park</A>, U.K., and in
Yakutsk, Siberia.

<P>Particles of such high energy pose a conundrum. On the one hand, they are
likely to come from outside our galaxy because no known acceleration mechanism
could produce them and because they approach from all directions even though a
galactic magnetic field is insufficient to bend their path. On the other hand,
their source cannot be more than about 30 million light-years away, because the
particles would otherwise lose energy by interaction with the <A
HREF="http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/html/cbr.html">universal microwave
background</A>--radiation left over from the birth of the cosmos in the big bang.
In the relativistic universe that the highest-energy cosmic rays inhabit, even a
single radio-frequency photon packs enough punch to rob a particle of much of its
energy.

<P>If the sources of such high-energy particles were distributed uniformly
throughout the cosmos, interaction with the microwave background would cause a
sharp cutoff in the number of particles with energy above 5 x 10<SUP>19</SUP>
eV, but that is not the case. There are as yet too few events above this nominal
threshold for us to know for certain what is going on, but even the few we have
seen provide us with a unique opportunity for theorizing. Because these rays are
essentially undeflected by the weak intergalactic magnetic fields, measuring the
direction of travel of a large enough sample should yield unambiguous clues to
the locations of their sources.

<P>It is interesting to speculate what the sources might be. Three recent
hypotheses suggest the range of possibilities: <A
HREF="http://legacy.gsfc.nasa.gov/Images/pretty_pictures_general.html">galactic
black-hole</A> accretion disks, <A
HREF="http://legacy.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/learning_center/university/bursts.html">gamma-ray
bursts</A> and <A
HREF="http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/gr/Report96-html/node2.html">topological
defects</A> in the fabric of the universe.

<P>Astrophysicists have predicted that black holes of a billion solar masses or
more, accreting matter in the nuclei of <A
HREF="http://www.kingsu.ab.ca/~brian/astro/chp14.htm">active galaxies</A>, are
needed to drive relativistic jets of matter far into intergalactic space at
speeds approaching that of light; such jets have been mapped with radio
telescopes. <A HREF="http://www.mpifr-bonn.mpg.de/biermann/PeBi/PeBi.html">Peter
L. Biermann</A> of the Max Planck Institute for Radioastronomy in Bonn and his
collaborators suggest that the hot spots seen in these radio lobes are shock
fronts that accelerate cosmic rays to ultrahigh energy. There are some
indications that the directions of the highest-energy cosmic rays to some extent
follow the distribution of radio galaxies in the sky.

<P>The speculation about <A
HREF="http://www.aas.org/ApJ/v462n2/5812/5812.html">gamma-ray bursts</A> takes
off from the theory that the bursts are created by relativistic explosions,
perhaps resulting from the coalescence of neutron stars. Mario Vietri of the <A
HREF="http://perseus.mporzio.astro.it/secretary/WWW/oarmp.html">Astronomical
Observatory of Rome</A> and Eli Waxman of <A
HREF="http://www.princeton.edu/">Princeton University</A> independently noted a
rough match between the energy available in such cataclysms and that needed to
supply the observed flux of the highest-energy cosmic rays. They argue that the
ultrahigh-speed shocks driven by these explosions act as cosmic accelerators.

<P>Perhaps most intriguing is the notion that ultrahigh-energy particles owe
their existence to the decay of <A
HREF="http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/gr/public/cs_top.html">monopoles, strings,
domain walls and other topological defects</A> that might have formed in the
early universe. These hypothetical objects are believed to harbor remnants of an
earlier, more symmetrical phase of the fundamental fields in nature, when
gravity, electromagnetism and the weak and strong nuclear forces were merged.
They can be thought of, in a sense, as infinitesimal pockets preserving bits of
the universe as it existed in the fractional instants after the big bang.

<P>As these pockets collapse, and the symmetry of the forces within them breaks,
the energy stored in them is released in the form of supermassive particles that
immediately decay into jets of particles with energies up to 100,000 times
greater than those of the known ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays. In this scenario
the ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays we observe are the comparatively sluggish
products of cosmological particle cascades.

<P>Whatever the source of these cosmic rays, the challenge is to collect enough
of them to search for detailed correlations with extragalactic objects. The <A
HREF="http://www.icrr.u-tokyo.ac.jp/as/project/agasa.html">AGASA array</A> in
Japan currently has an effective area of 200 square kilometers, and the new <A
HREF="http://www.physics.adelaide.edu.au/astrophysics/FlysEye.html">Fly's Eye
HiRes experiment</A> in Utah will cover about 1,000 square kilometers. Each
detector, however, can capture only a few ultrahigh-energy events a year.

<P>For the past few years, Cronin and <A
HREF="http://cdfinfo.in2p3.fr/Experiences/Astrop/Auger/watson.html">Alan A.
Watson</A> of the University of Leeds have been spearheading an initiative to
gather an even larger sample of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays. This development is
named the <A
HREF="http://www.tandar.cnea.edu.ar/fne/auger/auger_argentina.html">Auger
Project</A>, after Pierre Auger, the French scientist who first investigated the
phenomenon of correlated showers of particles from cosmic rays. The plan is to
provide detectors with areas of 9,000 square kilometers that are capable of
measuring hundreds of high-energy events a year. A detector field would consist
of many stations on a 1.5-kilometer grid; a single event might trigger dozens of
stations.

<P>An Auger Project design workshop held at the <A
HREF="http://tsswww.fnal.gov/Giant_Array_Project/GAP_Welcome.html">Fermi National
Accelerator Laboratory</A> in 1995 has shown how modern off-the-shelf technology
such as solar cells, cellular telephones and Global Positioning System receivers
can make such a system far easier to construct. A detector the size of Rhode
Island could be built for about $50 million. To cover the entire sky, two such
detectors are planned, one each for the Northern and Southern hemispheres.

<P>As researchers confront the problem of building and operating such gigantic
detector networks, the fundamental question remains: Can nature produce even more
energetic particles than those we have seen? Could there be still higher-energy
cosmic rays, or are we already beginning to detect the highest-energy particles
our universe can create?

<P>We all pass through life surrounded--and even sustained--by the flow of
fluids. Blood moves through the vessels in our bodies, and <a href="http://www.best.com/~smurman/cfd_intro/air.html">air</a> (a fluid, properly
speaking) flows into our lungs. Our vehicles move through our planet's blanket of
air or across its lakes and seas, powered by still other fluids, such as fuel and
oxidizer, that mix in the combustion chambers of engines. Indeed, many of the
environmental or energy-related issues we face today cannot possibly be
confronted without detailed knowledge of the mechanics of fluids.

<P>Practically all the fluid flows that interest scientists and engineers are
turbulent ones; turbulence is the rule, not the exception, in fluid dynamics. A
solid grasp of turbulence, for example, can allow engineers to reduce the
aerodynamic drag on an automobile or a <A
HREF="http://www.dfrc.nasa.gov/PAO/X-Press/1995/xp-95-11.html">commercial
airliner</A>, increase the maneuverability of a jet fighter or improve the fuel
efficiency of an engine. An understanding of turbulence is also necessary to
comprehend the <A HREF="http://home.earthlink.net/~dendrob/norm.html">flow of
blood in the heart</A>, especially in the <A
HREF="http://www.ibt.unit.no/~hanst/UsImages.html">left ventricle</A>, where
the movement is particularly swift.

But what exactly is <A
HREF="http://www.best.com/~smurman/cfd_intro/turbulence.html">turbulence</A>? A
few everyday examples may be illuminating. Open a kitchen tap only a bit, and the
water that flows from the faucet will be smooth and glassy. This flow is known as
<A
HREF="http://www.exploratorium.edu/xref/phenomena/laminar_flow.html">laminar</A>.
Open the tap a little further, and the flow becomes more roiled and
sinuous--turbulent, in other words. The same phenomenon can be seen in the smoke
streaming upward into still air from a burning cigarette. Immediately above the
cigarette, the flow is laminar. A little higher up, it becomes rippled and
diffusive.

<P>Turbulence is composed of eddies: patches of zigzagging, often swirling fluid,
moving randomly around and about the overall direction of motion. Technically,
the chaotic state of fluid motion arises when the speed of the fluid exceeds a
specific threshold, below which viscous forces damp out the chaotic behavior.

<P>Turbulence, however, is not simply an unfortunate phenomenon to be eliminated
at every opportunity. Far from it: many engineers work hard trying to increase
it. In the cylinders of an internal-combustion engine, for example, turbulence
enhances the mixing of fuel and oxidizer and produces cleaner, more efficient
combustion. And only turbulence can explain why a golf ball's dimples enable a
skilled golfer to drive the ball 250 meters, rather than 100 at most.

<P>Turbulence may have gotten its bad reputation because dealing with it
mathematically is one of the most notoriously thorny problems of classical
physics. For a phenomenon that is literally ubiquitous, remarkably little of a
quantitative nature is known about it. <A
HREF="http://www.mindspring.com/~madpickl/stuff3.htm">Richard Feynman</A>, the
great Nobel Prize-winning physicist, called turbulence "the most important
unsolved problem of classical physics." Its difficulty was wittily expressed in
1932 by the British physicist <A
HREF="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Lamb.html">Horace
Lamb</A>, who, in an address to the British Association for the Advancement of
Science, reportedly said, "I am an old man now, and when I die and go to heaven
there are two matters on which I hope for enlightenment. One is quantum
electrodynamics, and the other is the turbulent motion of fluids. And about the
former I am rather optimistic."

<P>Of course, Lamb could not have foreseen the development of the modern
supercomputer. These technological marvels are at last making it possible for
engineers and scientists to gain fleeting but valuable insights into turbulence.
Already this work has led to technology, now in development, that may someday be
employed on airplane wings to reduce drag by several percent--enough to save
untold billions of dollars in fuel costs. At the same time, these insights are
guiding the design of jet engines to improve both efficiency and performance.

<P>As recondite as it is, the study of turbulence is a major component of the
larger field of fluid dynamics, which deals with the motion of all liquids and
gases. Similarly, the application of powerful computers to simulate and study
fluid flows that happen to be turbulent is a large part of the burgeoning field
of <a href="http://www.best.com/~smurman/cfd_intro/cfd_basics.html">computational fluid dynamics (CFD)</a>. In recent years, fluid dynamicists have
used supercomputers to simulate flows in such diverse cases as the <A
HREF="http://www.ac2000.org/cup/aboutac.html">America's Cup</A> racing yachts and
blood movement through an artificial heart.

<A NAME="1"><B>CFD: 150 Years in the Making</B></A>

<P>What do we mean when we speak of simulating a fluid flow on a computer? In
simplest terms, the computer solves a series of well-known equations that are
used to compute, for any point in space near an object, the velocity and pressure
of the fluid flowing around that object. These equations were discovered
independently more than a century and a half ago by the French engineer <A
HREF="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Navier.html">Claude
Navier</A> and the Irish mathematician <A
HREF="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Stokes.html">George
Stokes</A>. The equations, which derive directly from Newton's laws of motion,
are known as the <A
HREF="http://www.best.com/~smurman/cfd_intro/ns_eqns.html">Navier-Stokes
equations</A>. It was the application of supercomputers to these equations that
gave rise to the field of <A
HREF="http://www.cranfield.ac.uk/sme/cfd/pages/whatis_cfd.html">computational
fluid dynamics</A>; this marriage has been one of the greatest achievements in
fluid dynamics since the equations themselves were formulated.

<P>Although the marriage has been successful, the courtship was a rather long
one. Not until the late 1960s did supercomputers begin achieving processing rates
fast enough to solve the Navier-Stokes equations for some fairly straightforward
cases, such as two-dimensional, slowly moving flows about an obstacle. Before
then, <A
HREF="http://www.adventure.com/library/encyclopedia/aviation/rfiwitun.html">wind
tunnels</A> were essentially the only way of testing the aerodynamics of new
aircraft designs. Even today the limits of the most powerful <A
HREF="http://www.nas.nasa.gov/NAS/GenInfo/hsp.html">supercomputers</A> still make
it necessary to resort to wind tunnels to verify the design for a new airplane.

<P>Although both computational fluid dynamics and wind tunnels are now used for
aircraft development, continued advances in computer technology and algorithms
are giving CFD a bigger share of the process. This is particularly true in the
early design stages, when engineers are establishing key dimensions and other
basic parameters of the aircraft. Trial and error dominate this process, and
wind-tunnel testing is very expensive, requiring designers to build and test each
successive model. Because of the increased role of computational fluid dynamics,
a typical design cycle now involves between two and four wind-tunnel tests of
wing models instead of the 10 to 15 that were once the norm.

<P>Another advantage of supercomputer simulations is, ironically, their ability
to simulate more realistic flight conditions. Wind-tunnel tests can be
contaminated by the influence of the tunnel's walls and the <a href="http://www.best.com/~smurman/cfd_intro/pix/f18_tunnelsml.jpg">structure </a>that holds
the model in place. Some of the flight vehicles of the future will fly at many
times the speed of sound and under conditions too extreme for wind-tunnel
testing. For <A
HREF="http://users.arn.net/~webbfeat/PROJECT%20BLACK/HyperX.html">hypersonic
aircraft</A> (those that will fly at up to 20 times the speed of sound) and
spacecraft that fly both within and beyond the atmosphere, computational fluid
dynamics is the only viable tool for design. For these vehicles, which pass
through the thin, uppermost levels of the atmosphere, nonequilibrium air
chemistry and molecular physics must be taken into account.

<P>Engine designers also rely extensively on computational techniques,
particularly in the development of jet engines. A program called <A
HREF="http://podev.appl.wpafb.af.mil/poc/pot/ihptet/ihptet.html">Integrated High
Performance Turbine Engine Technology</A> is seeking a 100 percent improvement in
the thrust-to-weight ratio of <A
HREF="http://www.lerc.nasa.gov/Other_Groups/ACCL/ENG10/engines.html">jet
engines</A> and a 40 percent improvement in fuel efficiency by 2003. The project
is supported by the U.S. Department of Defense, the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration and various makers of jet engines.

<P>The flow of air and fuel through a <a href="http://www.lerc.nasa.gov/Other_Groups/ACCL/ENG10/engines.html">jet engine's</a> various sections and passages
is complex. A fan draws air into an internal chamber called a compressor. There
multiple rotating and stationary stages increase the pressure about 20-fold. This
high-pressure air is fed into a combustor, where it mixes with fuel and is
ignited. Finally, the hot, very expanded exhaust drives a turbine. This turbine
powers the fan and the compressor and, more important, generates thrust by
directing the exhaust out of the rear of the engine at high velocity. Currently
engineers use computational fluid dynamics to design turbine blades, inlet
passages and the geometry of combustors. Simulations also help engineers shape
the afterburner mixers that, in military aircraft, provide additional thrust for
greater maneuverability. And they play a role in designing nacelles, the bulbous,
cylindrical engine casings that typically hang below the wings.

<P><A NAME="2"><B>Applying the Equations</B></A>

<P>To understand how the Navier-Stokes equations work, consider the flow of air
over an airplane in flight. In reality, it will probably be many decades before
computers are powerful enough to simulate in a detailed manner the fluid flows
over an entire airplane. In theory, however, the Navier-Stokes equations can
reveal the velocity and pressure of the air rushing by any point near the
aircraft's surface. Engineers could then use these data to compute, for various
flight conditions, all aerodynamic parameters of interest--namely, the lift, drag
and moments (twisting forces) exerted on the airplane.

<P><A
HREF="http://www.exploratorium.edu/xref/phenomena/aerodynamic_drag.html">Drag</A>
is particularly important because it determines an aircraft's fuel efficiency.
Fuel is one of the largest operating expenses for most airlines. Not
surprisingly, aircraft companies have spent huge sums to reduce drag by even tiny
increments. In general, though, lift is relatively easy to calculate, moments are
harder, and drag is hardest of all.

<P>Drag is difficult to compute mainly because it is the parameter most dependent
on turbulence. Of course, in this context we are not referring to the bumpiness
that provokes the pilot to remind passengers to fasten their seat belts. Even
when a plane is flying smoothly, the flow of air within a few centimeters of its
surface, in a volume known as the <a href="http://www.best.com/~smurman/cfd_intro/boundary_layer.html">boundary layer</a>, is turbulent. Because of
turbulence, the high-speed air several millimeters above the surface of the wings
is brought very close to the surface, where it undergoes a more abrupt--and
momentum-robbing--deceleration. The equal and opposite reaction to this flow
deceleration is drag on the aircraft. A great deal of the work of aerodynamicists
involves understanding the mechanics of the generation and destruction of
turbulence well enough to control it.

<P>To solve the Navier-Stokes equations, engineers start by entering into the
equations certain variables known as initial and boundary conditions. For an
airplane in flight, the initial conditions include wind velocity and atmospheric
disturbances, such as air currents. The boundary conditions include the precise
shape of the aircraft, translated into mathematical coordinates.

Before the equations can be applied to an aircraft, computer specialists must
represent the aircraft's surface and the space around it in a form usable by the
computer. So they represent the airplane and its surroundings as a series of
regularly spaced points, known as a <A
HREF="http://www.best.com/~smurman/cfd_intro/gridgen.html">computational
grid</A>. They then supply the coordinates and related parameters of the grid to
the <a href="http://diana.ae.utexas.edu/homepage/img.html">software </a>that applies the Navier-Stokes equations to the data. The computer
calculates a value for the parameters of interest--air velocity and pressure--for
each of the <a href="http://www.best.com/~smurman/cfd_intro/gridpoint.html">grid points</a>.

<P>In effect, the computational grid breaks up (the technical term is
"discretizes") the <a href="http://www.best.com/~smurman/cfd_intro/grid_transform.html">computational problem in space</a>; the calculations are carried
out at regular intervals to simulate the passage of time, so the simulation is
temporally discrete as well. The closer together--and therefore more
numerous--the points are in the computational grid, and the more often they are
computed (the shorter the time interval), the more accurate and realistic the
simulation is. In fact, for objects with complex shapes, even defining the
surface and generating a computational grid can be a challenge.

<P>Unfortunately, entering the initial and boundary conditions does not guarantee
a solution, at least not with the computers available today or in the foreseeable
future. The difficulty arises from the fact that the Navier-Stokes equations are
nonlinear; in other words, the many variables in the equations vary with respect
to one another by powers of two or greater. Interaction of these nonlinear
variables generates a broad range of scales, which can make solving the equations
exceedingly difficult. Specifically, in turbulence, the range of the size of
whirling eddies can vary 1,000-fold or even more. There are other complicating
factors as well, such as global dependence: the nature of the equations is that
the fluid pressure at one point depends on the flow at many other points. Because
the different parts of the problem are so interrelated, solutions must be
obtained at many points simultaneously.

<P><A NAME="3"><B>Computational B&ecirc;te Noir</B></A>

<P>Although the preceding description conveys the basics of a fluid dynamics
simulation, it leaves out turbulence, without which a realistic discussion of the
capabilities--and limitations--of computational fluid dynamics would be futile.
The complexities engendered by turbulence severely limit our ability to simulate
fluid flow realistically.

Perhaps the simplest way to define turbulence is by reference to the <a href="http://www.processassociates.com/process/dimen/dn_rey.htm">Reynolds
number</a>, a parameter that compactly characterizes a <a href="http://www.best.com/~smurman/cfd_intro/variables.html">flow</a>. Named after the British
engineer <A
HREF="http://hawkeye.me.utexas.edu/~heatran/bios/reynolds.html">Osborne
Reynolds</A>, this number indicates the ratio, or relative importance, of the
flow's inertial forces to its viscous ones. (A flow's inertial force is
calculated by multiplying together the fluid's <a href="http://www.best.com/~smurman/cfd_intro/variables.html#density">density </a>and the square of its
velocity and dividing this product by a characteristic length of the flow, such
as the width of the airfoil, if the flow is over a wing.)

<P>Large inertial forces, relative to the viscous ones, tend to favor turbulence,
whereas high <a href="http://www.best.com/~smurman/cfd_intro/variables.html#viscosity">viscosity </a>staves it off. Put another way, turbulence occurs when the
<A HREF="http://www.processassociates.com/process/dimen/dn_rey.htm">Reynolds
number</A> exceeds a certain value. The number is proportional to both the size
of the object and the flow velocity. For example, the Reynolds number for air
flowing over the fuselage of a cruising commercial aircraft is in the
neighborhood of 100 million. For the air flowing past a good fastball, the
Reynolds number is about 200,000. For blood flowing in a midsize artery, it is
about 1,000.

<P>As we have seen, a distinguishing characteristic of a <A
HREF="http://trinity.tamu.edu/~hicup/RESEARCH/turb.html">turbulent flow</A> is
that it is composed of eddies, also known as vortices, in a broad range of sizes.
These vortices are continually forming and breaking down. Large eddies break down
into smaller ones, which break down into yet smaller eddies, and so on. When
eddies become small enough, they simply dissipate viscously into heat. The
British meteorologist <A
HREF="http://www.alumni.caltech.edu/~zimm/weather.html">Lewis F. Richardson</A>
described this process in verse:

<P><i>Big whorls have little whorls, <br>Which feed on their velocity, <br>And
little whorls have lesser whorls, <br>And so on to viscosity.</i>

<P>To solve the Navier-Stokes equations for, say, the flow over an airplane
requires a finely spaced computational grid to resolve the smallest eddies. On
the other hand, the grid must be large enough to encompass the entire airplane
and some of the space around it. The disparity of length scales in a turbulent
flow--the ratio of largest to smallest eddy size--can be calculated by raising
the flow's Reynolds number to the 3/4 power. This ratio can be used to estimate
the number of grid points that are needed for a reasonably accurate simulation:
because there are three dimensions, the number is proportional to the cube of
this ratio of length scales. Thus, the required number of grid points for a
numerical simulation is proportional to the Reynolds number raised to the 9/4
power. In other words, doubling the Reynolds number results in almost a fivefold
increase in the number of points required in the grid to simulate the flow.

<P>Consider a transport airplane with a 50-meter-long fuselage and wings with a
chord length (the distance from the leading to the trailing edge) of about five
meters. If the craft is cruising at 250 meters per second at an altitude of
10,000 meters, about 10 quadrillion (10<SUP>16</SUP>) grid points are required to simulate
the turbulence near the surface with reasonable detail.

<P>What kind of computational demands does this number of points impose? A rough
estimate, based on current algorithms and software, indicates that even with a
supercomputer capable of performing a trillion (10<SUP>12</SUP>) floating-point operations
per second, it would take several thousand years to compute the flow for one
second of flight time! Such a "teraflops" computer does not yet exist, although
researchers are now <A HREF="http://www.cs.sandia.gov/teraflop.html">attempting
to build one</A> at Sandia National Laboratories. It will be about 10 times
faster than the most powerful systems available today.

<P><A NAME="4"><B>Simulation Shortcuts</B></A>

<P>Fortunately, researchers need not simulate the flow over an entire aircraft to
produce useful information. Indeed, doing so would probably generate much more
data than we would know what to do with. Typically, fluid dynamicists care only
about the effects of turbulence on quantities of engineering significance, such
as the mean flow of a fluid or, in the case of an aircraft, the drag and lift
forces and the transfer of heat. In the case of an engine, designers may be
interested in the effects of turbulence on the rates at which fuel and oxidizer
mix.

<P>The Navier-Stokes equations are therefore often averaged over the scales of
the turbulence fluctuations. What this means is that, in practice, researchers
rarely calculate the motion of each and every small eddy. Instead they compute
the large eddies and then use ad hoc <a href="http://www.best.com/~smurman/cfd_intro/turb_model.html">modeling </a>practices to estimate the effects
of the small eddies on the larger ones. This practice gives rise to a simulated
averaged flow field that is smoother than the actual flow--and thus drastically
reduces the number of grid points necessary to simulate the field.

<P>The ad hoc models that this averaging process demands range in complexity from
simple enhanced coefficients of viscosity to entire additional systems of
equations. All these models require some assumptions and contain adjustable
coefficients that are derived from experiments. Therefore, at present,
simulations of averaged turbulent flows are only as good as the models they
contain.

<P>As computers become more powerful, however, fluid dynamicists are finding that
they can directly simulate greater proportions of turbulent eddies, enabling them
to reduce the range of scales that are modeled. These approaches are a compromise
between a direct numerical simulation of turbulence, in which all scales of
motion are resolved, and the turbulence-averaged computations.

<P>For years, meteorologists have used a form of this strategy called <A
HREF="http://trinity.tamu.edu/~hicup/RESEARCH/les.html">large-eddy
simulation</A> for weather prediction. In meteorology, the large-scale turbulent
motions are of particular interest, so in meteorological applications the
relatively large eddies are generally simulated in their entirety. Smaller-scale
eddies are important only inasmuch as they may affect the larger-scale
turbulence, so they are merely modeled. Recently engineers have begun using these
techniques for simulating <A
HREF="http://www.nas.nasa.gov/NAS/TechSums/9394/Book/074_nas.html">complex fluid
flows</A>, such as the gases inside a cylinder of an internal-combustion engine.

<P>Another current trend in computational fluid dynamics, also made possible by
increasing computational speed, is the direct, complete simulation of relatively
simple flows, such as the flow in a pipe. Simple as they are, simulations of some
of these flows, which have low Reynolds numbers, offer invaluable insights into
the nature of turbulence. They have revealed the basic structure of turbulent
eddies near a wall and subtleties of their influence on drag. They have also
generated useful data that have enabled engineers to validate or fine-tune the ad
hoc models they use in practical simulations of <a href="http://www.nas.nasa.gov/NAS/TechSums/9394/Book/074_nas.html">complex flows</a>.

<P>Lately the number of engineers and scientists seeking access to these data has
swelled to the point that immense data sets have been archived and made available
by the <A HREF="http://www.arc.nasa.gov/">NASA Ames Research Center</A>. Although
most researchers do not have the computing resources to perform direct
simulations of turbulence, they do have sufficient resources, such as powerful
workstations, to probe the archived data.

<P><A NAME="5"><B>From Prediction to Control</B></A>

<P>As supercomputers become faster and faster, fluid dynamicists are increasingly
able to move beyond predicting the effects of turbulence to actually controlling
them. Such control can have enormous financial benefits; a 10 percent reduction
in the drag of civilian aircraft, for example, could yield a 40 percent increase
in the profit margin of an airline. In a recent project, researchers at the <A
HREF="http://www.larc.nasa.gov/">NASA Langley Research Center</A> demonstrated
that placing longitudinal V-shaped grooves, called <A
HREF="http://www.nas.nasa.gov/NAS/TechSums/9293/98.html">riblets</A>, on the
surface of an aircraft's wing or fuselage leads to a 5 to 6 percent reduction in
viscous drag. Drag is reduced despite the increase in the surface area exposed to
the flow. For typical transport airplane speeds, the riblets must be very finely
spaced, about 40 microns apart, like phonograph grooves; larger riblets tend to
increase drag.

<P><table cellpadding=10 align=right width=92><tr> <td><A
HREF="0197moinbox5.html"><IMG SRC="IMG/0197moin6sm.gif" ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE
WIDTH="92" HEIGHT="92" BORDER="0"></A> <br clear=all><B><CENTER><A
HREF="0197moinbox5.html">V-Shaped Grooves</A></CENTER></B></td> </tr></table>

During this work, the researchers came across a Soviet study on toothlike
structures, called <A
HREF="http://www.ultranet.com/strength/anatomy.htm#scales">denticles</A>, on the
skin of sharks. These denticles strikingly resembled riblets, a fact that has
been interpreted as nature's endorsement of the riblet concept. Ultimately,
however, it was the direct numerical simulation of turbulent flow along riblets
that showed how they work. The riblets appear to inhibit the motion of eddies by
preventing them from coming very close to the surface (within about 50 microns).
By keeping the eddies this tiny distance away, the riblets prevent the eddies
from transporting high-speed fluid close to the surface, where it decelerates and
saps the aircraft's momentum.

<P>Another recent and exciting application of direct numerical simulation is in
the development of <A
HREF="http://www.ifdt.uh.edu/vtc/cvg/main.html">turbulence-control strategies
that are active</A> (as opposed to such passive strategies as riblets). With
these techniques the surface of, say, a wing would be moved slightly in response
to fluctuations in the turbulence of the fluid flowing over it. The wing's
surface would be built with composites having millions of embedded sensors and
actuators that respond to fluctuations in the fluid's pressure and speed in such
a way as to control the small eddies that cause the turbulence drag.

<P>Such technology appeared to be far-fetched as recently as three years ago, but
the advent of <A HREF="http://esto.sysplan.com/ETO/MEMS/">microelectromechanical
systems (MEMS)</A>, under the leadership of the U.S. Air Force, has brought such
a scheme to the brink of implementation. MEMS technology can fabricate integrated
circuits with the necessary microsensors, control logic and actuators. Active
control of turbulence near the wing's surface also has an encouraging analogue in
the form of a marine creature: dolphins achieve remarkable propulsive efficiency
as they swim, and fluid dynamicists have long speculated that these creatures do
it by moving their skins. It seems that smart aircraft skins, too, are endorsed
by nature.

<P>Getting back to those golf balls we mentioned earlier: they, too, present an
intriguing example of how a surface texture can advantageously control airflow.
The most important <A
HREF="http://www.golfweb.com/library/books/pog/pog3.html">drag exerted on a golf
ball</A> derives from air-pressure forces. This phenomenon arises when the air
pressure in front of the ball is significantly higher than the pressure behind
the ball. Because of the turbulence generated by the dimples, a golf ball is able
to fly about two and a half times farther than an identical but undimpled ball.

<P>The growing popularity of computational fluid dynamics to study turbulence
reflects both its promise, which is at last starting to be realized, and the
continued rapid increase in computational power. As supercomputer processing
rates approach and surpass a trillion floating-point operations per second over
the next few years, fluid dynamicists will begin taking on more complex turbulent
flows, of higher Reynolds numbers. Over the next decade, perhaps, researchers
will simulate the flow of air through key passages in a jet engine and obtain a
realistic simulation of an operating piston-cylinder assembly in an
internal-combustion engine, including the intake and combustion of fuel and the
exhaust of gases through valves. Through simulations such as these, researchers
will finally begin learning some of the deep secrets expressed by the equations
uncovered by Navier and Stokes a century and a half ago.

<B>AGED ANTS</B>

<P>In the August article "Insects of Generation X," David Schneider writes that the 17-year cicada is "perhaps the longest-lived insect in the world." These cicadas certainly do live a long time, but the Methuselah of insects is probably an ant queen. In their book <I>The Ants</I> (Harvard University Press, 1990), Bert H&#246;lldobler and Edward O. Wilson list seven species of ants in which the reproductive females can live for more than 18 years. Queen ants from the species <I>Pogonomyrmex owyheei </I>reportedly can live for 30 years or more. I find it interesting that insects have become the most successful group of animals by virtue of their marvelous cuticle, which enables them to resist desiccation in the open air. Yet the ones that live the longest reside for most of their lives in the 100 percent humidity of a subterranean environment.

<P><HR><B>DATING SERVICE</B>

<P>The excellent article by Elizabeth Nesme-Ribes, Sallie L. Baliunas and Dmitry Sokoloff, entitled "The Stellar Dynamo" [August], raised a question in my mind about radiocarbon dating. The authors mentioned research by John A. Eddy, who noted that the amount of carbon 14 in tree rings varied depending on the level of sunspot activity. During periods of increased sunspot activity, the magnetic fields in solar wind shield the earth from the cosmic rays that create carbon 14 in the upper atmosphere. But don't most dating systems rely on the assumption that the ratio of carbon 14 to carbon 12 in the atmosphere is constant over time? If so, how can radiocarbon dating be used accurately?

<P><I>ROBERT O. LOE, JR., Jacksonville, Fla.</I>

<P><B>Baliunas replies:</B> Scientists who carry out radiocarbon dating are aware that the ratio of carbon 14 to carbon 12 in the atmosphere has not been strictly constant over time and that the radiocarbon age of an ancient object differs somewhat from its true age. Several phenomena--including changes in sunspot activity--can contribute to such errors. Fortunately, researchers can circumvent this problem by calibrating the radiocarbon dating scale using samples for which the true age is known. Counting the yearly growth rings from live and fossil trees, for example, has provided a means to correct the radiocarbon timescale over the past 8,000 years. For more remote times, radiocarbon ages can be compared with results from other dating techniques that are not affected by cosmic ray variations. Such studies have shown that differences between radiocarbon ages and true ages can be as great as a few thousand years. These large discrepancies most likely result from long-term changes in the earth's magnetic field, which also affect the production of carbon 14.

<B>THE SANDS OF TONGA</B>

<P>The pictorial "Sands of the World," by Walter N. Mack and Elizabeth A. Leistikow, in your August issue was delightful. Sands seem dull until we look closely and see an infinity of wonders among the grains. The primary shells in one sample, however, were misidentified. The disklike objects in the sand from Tonga, in the southwest Pacific, are not the remains of crinoids. They are instead the shells of a large type of single-celled protist called a foraminiferan. These remarkable organisms produce a complex shell (called a test) with numerous tiny compartments, some of which are visible in the photograph. Crinoid fragments do not have this type of internal structure, and their stem fragments (which these tests resemble) would uniformly have a central hole.

<P><HR><B>IN DEFENSE OF DOWN UNDER</B>

<P>In their article "Sunlight and Skin Cancer," David J. Leffell and Douglas E. Brash [July] imply that the Australian population is predominantly made up of descendants of British and Irish criminals. Although the first European settlers on the continent were indeed convicts, their numbers were soon swamped by settlers with much the same origins and motivations as those who settled North America: namely, the new immigrants were drawn by fortune, freedom and opportunity.

<BR><B>DECEMBER 1946</B>

<P>The first fruits of atomic 'peacefare' are
already being harvested. Using the same techniques that produced the
bomb, laboratories at Oak Ridge are now turning out radio-active
isotopes. Much has been written about the use of radio-active
materials to trace vitamins, amino acids and other fuels for the human
machinery through the system, but benefits to industry have been
overlooked. Many chemical products are formed by processes which are
relatively mysterious. The isotopes, because they are atom-sized
'observers,' can help clear up the mysteries."

<P>Dr. Shibasaburo Kitasato has collected
from reliable sources information about 26,521 cases of diphtheria in
Japan previous to the introduction of serotherapy, 14,996 of whom
died (56 per cent). Of 353 cases treated after serotherapy was
introduced in Japan, from November, 1894, to November, 1895, only 31
died (8.78 per cent). There is reason to believe that mortality can be
lowered if treatment could be commenced early in the course of the
disease. Thus in 110 cases in which injections were made within
forty-eight hours after the invasion, all ended in recovery. On the
other hand, of 33 cases treated after the eighth day of the disease
(including some patients in a moribund condition), 11 were lost." 

<P>"Herr G. Kraus has investigated the purpose of the rise of
temperature at the time of flowering of various species of Acaceae and
Palmae. In Ceratozamia longifolia he found this elevation to take
place in the daytime, the maximum attained being 11.7 C above that of
the air. In the Acaceae examined, the elevation of temperature is
accompanied by a rapid consumption of starch and sugar. Dr. Stahl sees
in it a contrivance for attracting insects to assist in pollination."

<P>"India rubber is becoming a prime necessity of civilization due to
use in such articles as pneumatic tires and feeding bottles. But
rubber producing plants seldom exist within easy distance of some
export station. Hundreds of men have racked their brains to produce a
substitute, but none has in the least degree succeeded. Whether our
state, or any other, will enter this branch of tropical forestry
remains to be seen. The Germans, with their usual thoroughness, have a
strong scientific staff at the Cameroons. The English, in their usual
makeshift way, content themselves with sending home to Kew for
suggestions. But the government of India has at least tried an
experiment upon the great scale, a nursery of Para rubber trees in
Assam, extending over two hundred square miles."

<P><B>ERMAL C. FRAZE </B>patented the idea for a pull tab
that could be attached directly to the surface of a can top.</FONT>

<P><HR>Engineers interested in the aesthetics of their
profession might consider the aluminum or steel pop top, which goes by
many names. "Zip," "tap," "snap" and "pop"--as well as the less
sonorous "tab" and "ring"--are all adjectives that have preceded the
noun "top" at one time or another in the 35-year history of the
self-opening can lid.

<P>According to engineering lore, the late Ermal C. Fraze, founder of
Dayton Reliable Tool &AMP; Manufacturing Company in Ohio, came up with
a practical idea for the pop-top lid after attempting with halting
success to open a beer can on the bumper of his car. For decades,
inventors had been trying to devise a can with a self-contained
opener. Their elaborate schemes had proved unworkable because they
required complex manufacturing steps for the attachment of the pull
tab--the element that exerts force to open the can top. Fraze
succeeded because he conceived of a simple and economical rivet to
hold the tab in place. Unlike previous approaches, the rivet was
formed from the surface of the can top itself.

<P>Since the mid-1960s, the pop top has experienced dozens of
refinements. Sharp edges that might cut the person who drinks from the
can are gone. And the tab remains fixed to the top after opening, so
that park maintenance workers no longer spend hours scouring the
grounds to remove the metal scraps. The development of the technology,
in fact, continues. Today one pound of aluminum yields 1,000 tabs, a
fourfold increase over the amount produced per pound of metal in 1965.
The simple manufacture of snap, tap and pop may pose a challenge to
the ingenuity of the engineering community for years to come.

The U.S. wakes up to <BR>the threat of mad cow disease <BR>and its relatives 
</center>

<P>It is, in the words of one group of researchers, "a true quandary."
How can an abnormal form of a protein present in all mammals cause
some 15 different lethal brain diseases that affect animals as diverse
as hamsters, sheep, cattle, cats and humans? Yet the dominant theory
about the group of illnesses that includes scrapie in sheep, mad cow
disease in cattle and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans holds just
that. What is certain is that some mysterious agent that resists
standard chemical disinfection as well as high temperatures can
transmit these diseases between individuals and, less often, between
species. What is unknown is how the agent spreads under natural
conditions and how it destroys brain tissue. Because of the
characteristic spongelike appearance of brain tissue from stricken
animals, the diseases are called transmissible spongiform
encephalopathies (TSEs).

<P>Finding the answers is a matter of urgency. In Britain, <A HREF="http://www.sciam.com/explorations/081296explorations.html">mad cow
disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy</A>, has turned into a
national calamity. A worldwide ban is on British beef and livestock
imports. The government is slaughtering all cattle older than 30
months--some 30,000 a week--to allay fears that the disease, which
causes animals to become nervous and develop an unsteady gait, will
spread to people. So far British medical researchers have identified
14 unusual cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in young people that
they suspect were a human manifestation of mad cow disease. New
studies of the victims' brains appear to strengthen that conclusion.
The biochemical properties of the suspected disease-causing protein in
the brains of the victims are distinctly different from those usually
found in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, supporting the notion that the
disease came from a novel source.

<P>Apprehensive that the U.S. cattle industry could be in line for a
disaster like the one in Britain, in October the Food and Drug
Administration was about to propose controls on the use of
animal-derived protein and bone meal in cattle feed. Mad cow disease
is believed to have spread in Britain because of the practice of
incorporating material from the rendered carcasses of cattle and other
animals into cattle feed. That cannibalistic practice is also standard
in the U.S.

<P>Although only one case of the disease has been confirmed in North
America--in an animal imported from Britain to Canada--other TSEs,
including scrapie in sheep and comparable diseases in mink and mule
deer, are well known in the U.S. Nobody has any idea whether some
native scrapielike agent could transform itself into mad cow disease
or something unpleasantly like it. "As long as we continue to feed
cows to cows we are at risk," says Richard F. Marsh of the University
of Wisconsin, who has studied TSE in mink. The cattle-rendering
industry, however, is resisting blanket bans and wants to see controls
only on tissues for which there is firm evidence of infectivity.

<P>Unfortunately, the science of TSEs generally is not in a firm
state. Laboratory tests show that the diseases have variable and
strange characteristics. They are most easily transmitted by injecting
brain tissue from an infected animal into a recipient's brain, but
sometimes eating brain or other offal will do the job. (Kuru, a human
TSE formerly common in Papua New Guinea, was spread because the Fore
people ritually consumed the brains of their dead.) There are distinct
strains of some TSEs, including scrapie and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease,
but passage through a different species can permanently alter the
diseases' pathological characteristics in the original host species.

<P>The leading theory that ties these characteristics together comes
from Stanley B. Prusiner of the University of California at San
Francisco [see "<A HREF="http://www.sciam.com/0896issue/prion.html">The Prion Diseases</A>," by Stanley B. Prusiner;
Scientific American, January 1995]. The theory posits that a
ubiquitous mammalian protein called prion protein can, rarely, refold
itself into a toxic form that then speeds the conversion of more
healthy protein in a runaway process. Some mutant forms of the protein
are more likely to convert spontaneously than others, which accounts
for rare sporadic cases. TSEs are thus both inherited and
transmissible, and unlike those of any other known diseases, the
pathogen lacks DNA or RNA.

<P>Some of the strongest evidence for Prusiner's theory is his
demonstration that mice genetically engineered to produce an abnormal
prion protein develop a spongiform disease and can transmit illness to
other mice via their brain tissue. Critics, such as Richard Rubenstein
of the New York Institute for Basic Research, note that the mice in
these experiments contain very little of the abnormal prion protein
that is supposed to be the disease agent. So, Rubenstein argues, they
may not be truly comparable to animals with TSEs. Perhaps, Rubenstein
and others suggest, some toxin in the brains of the sick experimental
mice caused the recipients of their tissue to become sick, too.
Prusiner maintains, however, that no ordinary toxin is potent and slow
enough to give his results.

<P>Prusiner insists his most recent experiments, which employ
elaborate tests designed to rule out possible sources of error, make
his theory unassailable. And one of Prusiner's chief rivals, Byron W.
Caughey of the Rocky Mountain Laboratories of the National Institutes
of Health in Hamilton, Mont., has made the protein-only theory more
plausible by experiments that he believes replicate the process by
which TSEs propagate in the brain. Caughey and his associates have
shown that under specific chemical conditions, they can convert some
of the normal prion protein into the abnormal form in the test tube.
Moreover, abnormal proteins from different strains of scrapie, which
are chemically distinguishable, seem to produce their own
strain-specific type of abnormal protein.

<P>Caughey believes his experiments indicate that normal, healthy
prion protein changes into the pathological variant when it forms
aggregates of some 20 to 50 molecules. The process gets under way if
it is seeded by a piece of the abnormal aggregate. Together with Peter
T. Lansbury of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Caughey has
proposed a geometric model illustrating that aggregates can form in
different crystalline patterns corresponding to different TSEs.

<P>Caughey says he is keeping an open mind on whether there might be
some DNA or RNA along with the protein that might help explain the
variety of TSEs. The ultimate proof of the protein-only theory would
be to fabricate abnormal protein from simple chemicals and show that
it caused transmissible disease in animals, but neither Caughey nor
anyone else can do that. Caughey's experiments still need a seed from
a sick animal, and the amount of abnormal protein the experiments
produce is not enough to prove that the freshly created material can
cause disease.

<P>Prusiner, for his part, is not about to concede to Caughey. He
believes aggregates are merely an artifact of Caughey's experimental
procedures. "There are no ordered aggregates of polymers of prion
protein in cells in the brain," he declares. Prusiner's studies lead
him to think, instead, that an as yet unidentified "protein X" is
responsible for converting the normal prion protein to the scrapie
form. He and his co-workers have synthesized fragments of the healthy
prion protein and shown that they can spontaneously form fibrils that
resemble those seen in the TSE diseases.

<P>Whether protein-only prions can explain TSEs or not, it will take
more than a decade for British scientists to unravel how BSE spreads,
predicts D. Carleton Gajdusek of the NIH, who first showed how kuru
spreads. A test for TSEs in humans and in a few animals was announced
in September, but so far it seems to perform well only when clear
symptoms of illness have already developed. Although the test may be
useful to confirm suspected TSEs in humans, the most important step
for governments to take, Gajdusek says, is to maintain intensive
surveillance for patients with unusual neurological symptoms. His
pictures and descriptions of children with kuru have been distributed
to neurologists in Europe to help them recognize possible victims.

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>RADIATION LEVELS</B> were measured after a small
tank containing radioactive solution exploded near Tomsk-7 in
1993.</FONT></TD>

<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=336>
Russian officials are still injecting liquid nuclear waste directly
into the earth, two years after the extremely controversial cold war
practice was first disclosed in the U.S. press. Moreover, the
injections are taking place--with no end in sight--despite the fact
that the U.S. is now aiding the decaying weapons complex of the former
Soviet Union to the tune of half a billion dollars a year. None of the
U.S. money is being used to attempt to halt the massive dumping of
high-level nuclear waste.

<P>"They are still injecting at Tomsk and Krasnoyarsk," says Nils
Bohmer, a nuclear scientist at the <A HREF="http://www.grida.no/ngo/bellona/ehome/index.htm">Bellona Foundation</A>, a research
institute in Oslo, Norway, that specializes in environmental and
nuclear issues. Tomsk-7 and Krasnoyarsk-26 were key sites in the
sprawling former Soviet weapons complex. During the cold war, both
places were secret cities where plutonium and other materials for
nuclear weapons were produced in special reactors and industrial
plants. The plutonium produced at the sites is now as much a
by-product as the liquid, high-level waste, because the Russians are
no longer using this plutonium to make new nuclear weapons or reactor
fuel. They continue to run the reactors because they provide heat and
electricity for nearby towns.

<P>The fact that the waste is still being injected was confirmed by an
official of the Ministry of Atomic Energy of the Russian Federation
(Minatom) at a recent conference in Prudonice, near Prague, according
to several people who attended the conference. All asked that their
names--and even the name of the conference--not be used, out of
concern that the Russian attendees of the conference might be less
candid in the future. At Tomsk-7, approximately 1.1 billion curies of
radioactivity have been injected into the ground so far, Bohmer says.
(Exposure to tens of curies can endanger human beings.) At
Krasnoyarsk-26, roughly 700 million curies are believed to have been
released, Bohmer says. Tomsk and Krasnoyarsk are both in Siberia, near
rivers that empty into the Arctic Ocean. The liquids are injected into
the earth between 300 and 700 meters down, underneath layers of shale
and clay that, Minatom officials maintain, trap the liquids.

<P>U.S. experts, however, tend to be more disturbed by the practice.
"Groundwater flows are likely to bring that waste back to the
surface," says Henry W. Kendall, a Nobel Prize-winning physicist at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who has advised the U.S.
government on nuclear waste issues. "It's tomorrow's problem and
therefore can easily be forgotten," he adds.

<P>More serious may be possible dumping at a third site, Dmitrovgrad.
Little information was available, but Bohmer believes the practice
continues there as well. Injections at the Dmitrovgrad site are
particularly worrisome because of the possibility that they could
migrate into the nearby Volga River, near which great numbers of
people live. Citing Russian reports, Murray Feshbach, a professor at
Georgetown University and an expert on contamination in the former
Soviet Union, notes that contamination from the Dmitrovgrad injections
"has moved faster than they thought, so it becomes more likely to be a
danger to the large population along the Volga."

<P>Releases of radioactive waste into a lake also continue at another
materials production site, known as Chelyabinsk-65. During 1995,
700,000 curies were pumped into Lake Karachai, Bohmer states. The
lake's accumulation of 120 million curies already makes it one of the
most contaminated on the earth.

<P>This year the U.S. will spend approximately $530 million on a
bewilderingly large number of programs and initiatives focused on the
weapons complexes of the former Soviet Union. Very little of this
money goes toward environmental activities, however. The biggest
share--$300 million--is rigidly targeted to either eliminating or
preventing the proliferation of weapons, materials and delivery
systems of mass destruction.

<P>Much of the remaining $230 million is spent under the aegis of
various programs run by the U.S. Department of Energy. No formal
restrictions prevent this money from being spent on environmental
projects, although practically none of it is. "Any efforts to get
environmental projects going have been met with yawns," says a
spokesperson at one of the DOE's national laboratories. (Clyde W.
Frank, the DOE's deputy assistant secretary for environmental
restoration and waste management and a key figure in the department's
aid programs to Russia, did not respond to a request to be interviewed
for this article.)

<P>This year the bulk of the DOE money is being spent on what is known
as materials protection, control and accounting--keeping bomb-grade
materials out of the hands of terrorists or others who might use them
against the U.S. Some of the DOE money goes toward shoring up Russian
reactors; some is also spent on various pursuits aimed at keeping
former weapons scientists busy and therefore less likely to sell their
services to potentially hostile groups or nations.

<P>"Even if the DOE wanted a significant program to assist the
Russians in cleaning up their nuclear mess, Congress wouldn't fund
it," says Thomas B. Cochran, a senior scientist at the Natural
Resources Defense Council in Washington, D.C. "Unless you can see a
tangible benefit for the U.S., like having fewer nuclear weapons aimed
at it, funding is unlikely."

<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=336>

Deep in the Impenetrable Forest inside Uganda's Bwindi National
Park, an enclave of 13 mountain gorillas has suffered years of
interminable eavesdropping by primatologists trying to learn about the
animals: how they fight, mate, play. Recently fresh eyes peering
through the underbrush have focused instead on what humans can learn
from the great apes--specifically, what they know about medicine.

<P>"We call it 'zoopharmacognosy,' " says John P. Berry, a 24-year-old
plant biochemist at Cornell University who has spent months in Bwindi
studying mountain gorillas. "Anthropologist Richard W. Wrangham and my
adviser, <A HREF="http://www.bio.cornell.edu/hortorium/rodriguez/rodriguez.html">Eloy Rodriguez</A>, came up with that term after several beers in
an African disco" to describe their novel approach to drug hunting:
analyze the plants that other animals eat when they feel ill.
Chimpanzees, for example, have been seen swallowing whole leaves or
chewing the spongy pith from more than a dozen bitter-tasting plants
that they normally avoid. Testing the plants, researchers discovered
biologically active compounds in about half. Some kill parasites and
bacteria; others dispatch fungi or insects. Whether the chimps eat
what they do out of acquired knowledge or sheer instinct remains an
open question.

<P>In any case, it seems likely that gorillas do the same, so Berry
traveled from Ithaca to Africa in search of new drug candidates.
"Gorillas eat a somewhat bizarre and very diverse diet--everything
from bark and dead wood to leaves of every kind and even soil," Berry
relates with the authority of one who has tasted several ape
delicacies. "Their environment supplies more than enough food; it's
like a big salad bowl. So every day they get up from their nest site,
plop down, eat everything in sight, then move 50 meters and start all
over."

<P>Wild gorillas will charge at unfamiliar humans, so observers have
to habituate apes slowly to their presence by mimicking the animals'
behavior. "In the bush, the trackers smack their lips loudly, like
they're eating leaves. The male silverback will grunt, and they will
grunt right back." Every once in a while, thunderous flatulence comes
rumbling out of the underbrush, Berry says. "And the trackers will do
the same thing right back to them! They do a pretty good imitation,
actually."

<P>Berry himself concentrates more on the trail of half-eaten
vegetation the apes leave in their wake. On hearing second-hand
stories of sick gorillas climbing to the alpine regions to eat the
leaves of lobelia plants, Berry hiked up to see them. "They look like
something out of Dr. Seuss," he recalls. "Lobelia has 15-foot-tall
flowers and immense rosettes of leaves."

<P>Although Berry has yet to catch apes in the act of self-medication,
researchers have observed gorillas eating the bright red fruit of wild
ginger plants, which are used medicinally by local peoples in Gabon.
Analysis of the fruit showed it to contain a potent, water-soluble
antibiotic. "I tasted the fruit myself--it is sweet and gingery-hot,"
Berry says. "I like it. But you can't finish a whole fruit, because
you start feeling a queasy, burning sensation in your stomach," which
he speculates may indicate activity against normal gastric bacteria.
"We plan to look at the dung of gorillas that eat these, to see if
their microflora are resistant." Meanwhile Rodriguez is setting up
another observation post, in South America, where he may find new
drugs of a different kind. "There are reports of monkeys there eating
hallucinogenic plants and going bananas," Berry deadpans.

<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=336>

On September 24, President Bill Clinton signed the Comprehensive
Test Ban Treaty, a long-sought pact prohibiting nuclear weapons
testing. Less than one week later, Clinton signed a bill authorizing a
huge increase in funds for, well, nuclear weapons testing.

<P>More specifically, the legislation provides $191 million for fiscal
year 1997--up from only $18 million this year--for construction of a
gigantic laser complex capable of generating miniature thermonuclear
explosions. The stadium-size facility at Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory is expected to take six years to construct at a total cost
of $1.1 billion. Various environmental and arms-control groups oppose
the project, arguing that it is a relic of cold war thinking that
should be abandoned. "It's not evil," says Tom Zamora Collina of the
Institute for Science and International Security in Washington, D.C.
"It's just a waste of money."

<P>If built, the so-called <A HREF="http://www-lasers.llnl.gov/lasers/nif.html">National Ignition Facility (NIF)</A> will
consist of 192 lasers whose light will converge on minute pellets of
heavy hydrogen and cause them to implode. Ideally, the pellets will
then "ignite"--that is, achieve nuclear fusion, the same process that
makes stars shine and hydrogen bombs explode.

<P>Proponents of the NIF emphasize that it will have nonmilitary
applications. The machine could establish whether the technique known
as inertial confinement fusion holds any promise for commercial power
generation. Experiments may also provide insights into nuclear
processes that take place in the sun and other stars.

<P>But the primary justification for the facility is to ensure that
existing nuclear weapons work properly, now that the U.S. has pledged
not to conduct any more nuclear tests. (The test ban treaty must still
be ratified by the U.S. Senate and by legislatures of other countries
before it goes into effect.) Even before Clinton signed the treaty in
September, his administration had imposed a moratorium on testing; the
last full-scale detonation of a warhead occurred in 1992 at the end of
the Bush era.

<P>Administration officials nonetheless agreed to support the
Stockpile Stewardship Program, which is intended to ensure "the safety
and reliability" of existing weapons. The NIF is only the largest and
most expensive of more than half a dozen machines that the national
laboratories--including Los Alamos and Sandia as well as Lawrence
Livermore--will receive under the stewardship program.

<P>Critics of the NIF and other facilities charge that they served as
payments from the Clinton administration to the national laboratories
for their acceptance of a test ban. "These are bribes so they'll go
along with the CTBT," says Joseph Cirincione, chair of the Coalition
to Reduce Nuclear Dangers.

<P>That claim is corroborated by Frank von Hippel, a physicist at
Princeton University who served on a panel that reviewed the security
implications of the NIF for the Department of Energy. Although the
panel members had concerns about the facility, they did not take a
strong stance against it, von Hippel explains, because they feared
their opposition might damage the prospects for a test ban.

<P>The NIF may still bog down in legal challenges. The Department of
Energy is expected to release its final environmental impact statement
soon. Once the statement is published, it will immediately be
challenged in court by a coalition of 90 environmental and disarmament
groups, including the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) in
Washington, D.C. None of the potential applications of the NIF can
justify its cost, asserts Christopher Paine of the NRDC. The safety
and reliability of the stockpile can be maintained more cheaply and
effectively by testing components of existing weapons than by
conducting pure-fusion experiments, he says.

<P>In addition, Paine doubts whether the NIF can establish the
feasibility of inertial confinement fusion for power generation. Ion
beams and gas-based lasers, he says, have shown more promise than the
glass lasers that will be deployed in the NIF. Glass lasers, which use
glass rather than gas for a lasing medium, generate tremendous
temperatures and are susceptible to fracturing.

<P>Indeed, the lens of an NIF prototype laser--or "beamlet"--shattered
in a test firing at Livermore in September. "Here we are six months
from construction, and we can't build one little beamlet," Paine says.

HUMAN BIOLOGY

<center><H2>SEX AND <BR>THE SPINAL CORD</H2>

A new pathway <BR>for orgasm
</center>

<P>The sexiest part of the human body may never be ogled on the pages
of <I>Playboy. </I>New research suggests that this distinction goes to
the rather unphotogenic vagus nerve. Known to orchestrate such mundane
tasks as breathing, swallowing and vomiting, this nerve wends its way
through all the major organs, bypassing the spinal column and hooking
directly into the base of the brain.

<P>It is precisely because the vagus nerve does not touch the spinal
column that its role in sex was recently discovered. Barry R.
Komisaruk and Beverly Whipple of Rutgers University were investigating
reports of orgasm in women who had spinal cord injury above the ninth
thoracic vertebra. Although these women were not receiving stimuli
from the nerves known to be responsible for orgasm--the pudendal,
pelvic or hypogastric nerves--the two researchers documented the
hallmarks of orgasm: increases in their subjects' blood pressure,
heart rate, pain threshold and pupil dilation. "It was a complete
surprise," Komisaruk says. "We knew there had to be another pathway at
work."

<P>Delving deeper, Komisaruk turned to rat studies. He severed all the
sensory nerves that are known to serve the genitals and then
stimulated the rats' cervixes. He observed pupil dilation and an
increase in the animals' threshold to pain. Komisaruk next removed a
section of the spinal cord at thoracic vertebra seven, just above
where the pelvic and hypogastric nerves join the column. He observed
the same results.

<P>Komisaruk's findings recalled a 1990 study by Matthew J. Wayner and
his colleagues at the University of Texas at San Antonio. Wayner's
group injected a tracer into rat genitalia and observed that it was
taken up by the vagus nerve and the nodose ganglion of the
medulla--indicating that there was a pathway that circumnavigated the
spinal cord. Wayner's discovery, along with his own findings,
suggested to Komisaruk that he might have evidence for an undiscovered
route for orgasmic sensation. So he cut the vagus nerve in his rats
and repeated his experiments. There was no pupil dilation, no
increased resistance to pain. "The cranial nerves, like the vagus,
have been around since the early vertebrates," says <A HREF="http://cellbio.utmb.edu/willis/willis.htm">William D. Willis</A>,
a neurophysiologist at the University of Texas at Galveston.
"Komisaruk's research suggests that this may be a primitive and more
commonly found pathway for orgasm."

<P>Komisaruk and Whipple then turned back to their human subjects.
They injected women who had complete spinal cord injury with a tracer.
Although the hypogastric and pelvic nerves were useless, positron
emission tomographic scans revealed that the nodose ganglion of the
medulla was taking up the tracer.

<P>The existence of this pathway explains long-standing anecdotal
reports of nongenital orgasms in women with damaged spinal cords. Such
women have reported orgasm after stimulating a hypersensitive area
just above the level of the injury; in these cases, orgasm would take
place on the shoulder, chest or chin. (Similar studies on men are
being planned.) Komisaruk has hypothesized that any part of the body
is capable of excitation, tension and sudden release--indeed, the
cycle may be a function of the nervous system that manifests itself in
reflexes as nonsexual as sneezes and yawns.

<P>"The eventual goal of all this work," Whipple sums up, "is to tap
into and amplify this pathway so we can help women who've had
neurological problems. These women could have normal, healthy sex
lives."

ANTI GRAVITY

<center><H2>The Victors Go Despoiled</H2>
</center>

<P>Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me," Star
Trek's Mr. Scott once wisely noted. Unfortunately, Scotty never
revealed who should carry the shame for foolings greater than two.
Considering that the <A HREF="http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/ig_nobel/">Ig Nobel Prizes</A> were awarded in October for the
sixth year in a row, one can only assume there is plenty of shame to
go around.

<P>Harvard University's Sanders Theater accommodated this year's Ig
Nobels, a good-natured spoofing of those other awards that scientists,
writers and peaceable folks get. The Igs go to "individuals whose
achievements cannot or should not be reproduced," according to the
official program.

<P>Real Nobel laureates attended, namely, Dudley Herschbach
(Chemistry, 1986) and William Lipscomb (Chemistry, 1976). But Richard
Roberts, winner of the 1993 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine,
did not. "He planned to join us," alleged Marc Abrahams, the producer
and host of the Igs, "but, for some reason, instead chose to attend
his daughter's wedding in California. Happily we have a plaster cast
of his left foot." The cast was later auctioned, fetching $30.

<P>With biodiversity the theme, 13-year-old Kate Eppers, reputedly the
spokesperson for the Committee for Bacterial Rights, struggled to open
multicellulocentric minds. "Every time you wash your hands," she
entreated, "you wipe out billions and billions of bacteria, and that's
not fair. Bacteria have rights, too. When your mom asks you to wash
your hands, just say no."

<P>After this counsel came shocking revelations concerning the
taxonomic classification of Barney the television dinosaur, offered by
Earle Spamer of Philadelphia's Academy of Natural Sciences. Primarily
because of the purple fuzz on his dermal covering, Barney is actually
more closely related to a dead salmon than he is to any saurian,
according to Spamer. "How is he on a bagel?" cried out one not quite
fed-up attendee.

<P>Finally, Abrahams announced the Igs. Harald Moi of Oslo took home
the Public Health award for his groundbreaking discovery of a
gonorrhea infection transmitted via an inflatable doll. The victim was
a seaman, which merely confuses the issue. (Moi's finding was
published in the journal Genitourinary Medicine in 1993.) In a
perverse reversal of the usual Nobel itinerary, Moi traveled from
Scandinavia to Harvard to pick up his prize. "The biggest problem in
this case was how to perform the mandatory partner notification and
treatment," he noted in his acceptance speech. "I think on a ship, if
the crew is there for several months, perhaps they need dolls," he
said afterward. "But they shouldn't share them."

<P>Don Featherstone traveled all the way from Fitchburg, Mass., to
receive the Art Ig. Featherstone is the creator of the pink flamingo
lawn ornament. "Let's keep [future] archaeologists guessing," he
suggested. "Get out and buy as many of these lawn ornaments as
possible."

<P>Not all the winners made it to the festivities. Missing were five
tobacco executives, who garnered the Ig for Medicine, for "their
unshakable discovery, as testified to the U.S. Congress, that nicotine
is not addictive." Also absent was Robert Matthews of England's Aston
University, who captured the Ig for Physics with his 1995 paper in the
European Journal of Physics explaining that toast does indeed fall
buttered-side down.

<P>The evening featured much cavorting by Herschbach and Lipscomb, who
appeared in key roles in the opera Lament del Cockroach, "an epic tale
of punctuated equilibrium." They portrayed non-Blattidaen insects
trying to mate with female roaches so as to hybridize their own
species into hardier stock before an asteroid could wipe them out.
Somehow the opera was listed as having three acts, rather than major
segments.

<P>Abrahams wrapped up the ceremony by offering encouragement to the
entire scientific community: "If you didn't win an Ig Nobel Prize this
year, and especially if you did, better luck next year."

<center><H2>HARD <BR>TO MELT</H2>

Ice cubes that <BR>take the heat
</center>


<P>Ice melts when removed from its subzero confines, right? Not
certain kinds. Researchers have found that ordinary ice can remain
solid at five degrees Celsius and, possibly, up to 18 degrees C.

<P>Laura A. Stern and Stephen H. Kirby of the U.S. Geological Survey,
along with William B. Durham of Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory, made the serendipitous <A HREF="http://science-mag.aaas.org/science/scripts/display/short/273/5283/1843.html">discovery</A>. They were trying to
study a substance <A HREF="http://www.lpl.arizona.edu/%7Ebcohen/cv/abstracts/ices.html">found on moons of the outer solar system</A> and in cold
ocean-floor sediments--methane clathrate, to be specific. This
material has a cagelike structure of water molecules that traps
methane within its cavities. To make a rock of clathrate, the
scientists ground ice into a powder, mixed it with methane in a
cylinder, then gently warmed it.

<P>Because ice is less dense than liquid water, it occupies more
volume, and so the researchers expected the pressure to drop as the
ice melted, thereby making more space available. (The water's reaction
with methane should have reduced the pressure even further.) But they
saw no sudden pressure drop. Nor could they detect any absorption of
heat, indicative of melting.

<P>"I was raising my eyebrows at this point," Stern recounts. "I
thought it was an artifact of the system." Repeating the procedure
with neon instead of methane, she found the pressure dropped rapidly
at the melting point of ice. Methane, though, permitted the ice to be
superheated--that is, warmed beyond its melting point without melting.

<P>The investigators think each ice grain was able to acquire a rind
of methane clathrate. During warming, ice at the surface begins to
melt first; these incipient droplets of water were being instantly
transformed into clathrate. The rind thus acted as a shield,
preventing any water from touching the ice within--which would have
initiated the grain's change to water.

<P>"The melting temperature is the temperature at which the liquid and
solid are at equilibrium," Durham explains--if no liquid, no melting.
Another reason these ice grains can be superheated is that they
apparently have few defects: flaws in the crystalline structure of ice
can initiate the changeover to liquid droplets.

<P>A similar phenomenon was observed in 1986 with gold-coated crystals
of silver. And water frozen under pressure into different crystalline
configurations--namely, ice II through ice X--can withstand rather
toasty conditions (up to 70 degrees C). But the high temperatures for
ordinary ice, or ice I, are a first. "Others have found superheating
of a couple of degrees," Stern points out. "We're looking at perhaps
18 degrees." The researchers plan to repeat the experiment with larger
ice grains, to see if the effect is enhanced. Meanwhile they are
boning up on classical thermodynamics, which never seems to run out of
surprises.

EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY

<center><H2>FEAR AND FECUNDITY</H2>

Death-defying guppy stunts--<BR>just to dazzle the females
</center>

<P>Knights in days of yore would embark on dangerous adventures simply
to impress their intended ladies, and it's a fair bet that much modern
machismo still stems from the same motivation. The idea that male
animals perform risky stunts or evolve encumbering decorations simply
to show off their cool has divided biologists. A recent study of what
turns on females suggests, however, that the notion may be more than a
theoretical possibility, at least for a small fish.

<P><A HREF="http://aci.mta.ca/theumbrella/biology/jeanguygodin.html">Jean-Guy J. Godin</A> of Mount Allison University in New Brunswick and
Lee Alan Dugatkin of the University of Louisville studied first how
male Trinidadian guppies that vary in the amount of orange coloration
on their bellies respond to a predator fish, both when possible mates
were present and when they were absent. The researchers then looked at
what kind of male behavior tempted the females to get acquainted
later. The results, reported in the <I>Proceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences, </I>leave some room for biologists to debate
their interpretation but have an uncomfortably familiar ring to anyone
who has gone through puberty.

<P>Flashily colored males were far more likely to make close
approaches to inspect a model predator than were drab males. Not too
surprising, given that the dandies might be more vigorous and better
able to look after themselves. More intriguing was that the flashy
males maintained their bravado when females were around, thus
apparently losing out on the chance to strike up a relationship. Drab
males, in contrast, would keep their distance from a predator in order
to stay close to an appealing female. That might suggest the gaudy
individuals were making a mistake, but their payoff came later.
Females that had watched displays of derring-do preferred to spend
time subsequently with studs that fearlessly approached the predator
than with milquetoasts.

<P>The authors suggest female guppies bestow their charms mainly on
males who live dangerously because boldness and colorfulness are
honest signals of genetic quality. The signals are honest because for
weak specimens, checking out predators and being brightly colored are
genuinely risky--both mean an increased chance of being swallowed. A
show-off male really must be healthy to survive, and so the impressed
females demonstrate their interest.

<P>Many theorists now agree that evolution can in principle produce
handicaps, as biologists call displays that impress because they are
dangerous to their owner. This paradoxical idea was proposed by Amotz
Zahavi of Tel Aviv University in 1975, but nobody has yet found an
unassailable instance. Some biologists wonder whether Godin and
Dugatkin's fast-lane male guppies were really putting themselves in
harm's way, because they were also more quick to turn and flee. But
Godin and Dugatkin hope to show that male guppies' romantic
extravagances can qualify as handicaps, by investigating whether the
male and female roles in their courtship drama are inherited. If the
scientists succeed, academic prizes--and who knows what other
rewards--may be theirs.

<B>Extreme Doubt</B>

<P>The thrill is gone over findings that a form of DRD4--a gene coding for dopamine receptors in the brain--leads to novelty-seeking behavior. Scientists at the National Institutes of Health compared the genes of Finnish alcoholics, clear novelty-seekers according to standard psychological tests, and more stoical control subjects. The suspect DRD4 form, they found, appeared equally in both groups. What is more, alcoholics carrying the novelty-seeking gene were the least adventurous of their lot.

<P><HR><B>Combinatorial Support</B>


<P>Researchers at Merck Laboratories have simplified combinatorial chemistry--a cut-and-paste process that churns out thousands of potentially valuable compounds all at once. Chemists have always tagged these products for testing with tiny inert spheres. But dendrimers, too, can be used as labels. These large molecules are quick to assemble and dissolve more readily than the spheres do--making it easier to analyze the reaction products.

<P><HR><B>Critical Costs</B>

<P>Managed care plans, the Journal of the American Medical Association reports, offer no real savings to the critically ill. Researchers at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center credit the lower costs to stronger patients, not greater efficiency. Indeed, they found that managed care patients in the intensive care unit were generally younger than those with traditional insurance and so needed less time to recover. In time, then, managed care plans may well become more expensive.

<P><HR><B>Stoking the Oldest Coal</B>

<P>Humans have kindled fire with coal since Paleolithic times, it now seems. At two Stone Age settlements near Nantes, France, archaeologists uncovered oddly compressed charcoal bits--some in a hearth. The specimens were deformed before they were charred and so entered the hearth as coal, not wood. The scientists speculate that wood may have been scarce during the last glacial age.

<P><HR><B>Hothouse Flowers</B>

<P>The lotus, often painted with its petals folded around a phallus, has long symbolized female fertility. In keeping, new research shows that these exotic blossoms embrace beetles and other pollinators at night--attracting them with heat. Botanists in Australia found that lotus petals shielded from sunlight remained between 29 and 36 degrees Celsius (85 and 96 degrees Fahrenheit)--even when the air surrounding them dropped to 10 degrees C. Only two other plant species similarly regulate their own temperature: Philodendron selloum and Symplocarpus foetidus.

<P><HR><B>The Chicken <I>and</I> the Egg</B>

<P>The earliest lineages most likely sprung forth from ribozymes, biochemists at Yale University now say. These large RNA enzymes edit genes by removing flawed code and splicing in the correction. Thus, they may have served as both chicken and egg in primitive cell reproduction. Most recently, researchers have tried to use ribozymes to erase viral genes responsible for deadly infections and to repair faulty genes causing various inherited conditions.

<P><HR><B>Cashing in on Contraceptives</B>

<P>Public funding for contraceptive services clearly limits the number of teenage and single mothers. In addition, these measures dramatically lower abortion rates and Medicaid expenditures. In a recent study, the Alan Guttmacher Institute calculated that were this funding cut, abortion rates would rise by 40 percent in the U.S. The estimate--which is conservative by many accounts--means that each tax dollar spent on contraceptive services saves three dollars in Medicaid costs for treating pregnant women and newborns.

<P><HR><B>Tracking Solar Neutrinos</B>

<P>In September scientists dismissed the long-held belief that the number of neutrinos emitted by the sun follows an 11-year cycle. A few weeks later Peter Sturrock and Guenther Walther of Stanford University put forth a new periodicity: after studying data from detectors in South Dakota, Japan and Italy, they say solar neutrino changes take place every 21.3 days.

FOLLOW-UP

<P><B>Fourth Rock from the Sun</B> 

<P>Believers had a big thrill last summer when NASA announced that they had uncovered signs of Martian life in a meteor. The evidence came in the form of tiny, sausage-shaped imprints, which the scientists said were most likely left by "nanobacteria." Now, however, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have demonstrated that purely inorganic happenings can make identical marks. The truth is out there. (See October 1996, page 20.)

<P><HR><B>Waiting to Exhale</B>

<P>A simple breath test can now diagnose peptic ulcers caused by Helicobacter pylori. To detect this bacteria in the past, physicians biopsied a patient's stomach tissue. But soon they may use the Meretek UBT Breath Test, approved by the FDA in September. Patients slosh down a urea solution, fortified with heavy carbon isotopes. Because H. pylori breaks urea down rapidly, the heavy carbon wafts up and out if the organisms are present. (See February 1996, page 104.)

A scant four years ago the super-computing market seemed poised to
move beyond its government and academic roots and make a grand
entrance into the much larger worlds of commerce and industry. In the
U.S. alone, more than a dozen companies planned for this shift by
marketing or developing ultrahigh-performance computers. But the big
move into the mainstream never occurred to the extent that many
analysts had predicted.

<P>Instead the organizations that were designing or promoting these
machines withered or folded altogether (some even before they managed
to complete their machines). Today only two viable domestic producers
of high-end supercomputers remain in the U.S.: Cray Research--which
was recently bought by Silicon Graphics--and IBM.

<P>Now a new entrant, <A HREF="http://www.tera.com/tera.html">Tera Computer Company</A> in Seattle, is preparing
to wade into these treacherous waters. Tera's long-overdue computer
has been in development for almost a decade--throughout the entire
boom and bust cycle that eventually left the supercomputer market in
its present dormancy. The company is expected to deliver its first
machine to the San Diego Supercomputer Center, part of the University
of California system, early next year.

<P>Why do Tera's founders think they can succeed where many of the
industry's brightest minds have recently failed? "We're different,"
says Burton J. Smith, Tera's chairman and chief scientist. "Whether
that translates into success in the market, we'll see. But certainly,
the same old approach won't work."

<P>The Tera machine is billed as the world's first shared-memory
computer that can be scaled up to include hundreds of processors (the
ability to accommodate so many processors puts the machine in a
category known as massively parallel). In a shared-memory machine, all
the processors have access to a common memory; in the alternative
design, called distributed memory, each processor has its own memory.
The chief advantage of shared memory is ease of use. The model it
presents to programmers is relatively straightforward, because they
need not keep track of which memory harbors individual data elements.

<P>One significant difficulty in building a highly parallel
shared-memory machine is that various techniques are necessary to
ensure that multiple processors do not waste too much of their time
inhibiting one another by trying to access the same data at the same
time. These techniques, in turn, can easily lead to inefficiencies
that seriously degrade the machine's overall performance.

<P>Tera hopes to get around this problem with a unique design, in
which each of the machine's processors can act as though it were as
many as 128 different "virtual" processors. Each virtual processor
runs a different programming job or a different piece of a larger job.
On each clock cycle the machine can switch from one virtual processor
to another; in so doing, it executes with every tick of the clock an
instruction from a different program. This same scheme is employed to
keep the machine's processors from competing for data.

<P>The Tera machine's processors are custom-designed; this fact is
significant because the power and economy of mass-produced processors
are often cited as factors in the collapse of the supercomputing
market. As much cheaper and easier-to-use workstations based on
off-the-shelf processors increased in power, fewer buyers were willing
to pay for relatively complex supercomputers based on custom
processors, especially when these machines were much harder to
program.

<P>On the other hand, computer scientists agree that custom design of
processors provides the only means for a shared-memory computer to
include as many processors as Tera's (eventually, up to 256).

<P>To avoid the fate of so many of its predecessors, the Tera
machine--which is expected to cost about $10 million for a
configuration with 16 processors--will have to enable users
consistently to achieve a reasonable fraction of its theoretical peak
processing rate of about one billion floating-point operations per
second (one "gigaflop") for each processor. "They'll need to get very
high efficiency out of those processors," says Wayne Pfeiffer,
associate director of the San Diego center. The Tera machine's
projected peak rate of one gigaflop per processor is about half that
of the Cray T90, a state-of-the-art vector supercomputer. The T90,
however, can include no more than 32 processors.

<P>Regardless of whether Tera succeeds, the future of
ultrahigh-performance computing belongs to scalable machines,
according to Malvin H. Kalos, director of the Cornell Theory Center, a
supercomputer facility located at Cornell University. Only this type
of machine, he asserts, has a chance of achieving the trillion
floating-point operations per second (a "teraflop") that many
scientists and engineers are seeking to help them meet a series of
"Grand Challenges" first identified years ago by the Nobel
Prize-winning physicist Kenneth Wilson. These challenges include
so-called rational drug design, which would let biochemists design
entire drug molecules on a computer, and the forecasting, on a fine
scale, of global shifts in rainfall, temperature and other climate
factors over periods ranging from decades to centuries.

MATERIALS SCIENCE

<center><H2>WELDING <BR>WITH A MATCH</H2>

Foils less than 100 microns thick <BR>bond with a mere spark
</center>

<P>Lugging around a torch and tanks of oxygen and fuel for welding is
hardly convenient for a soldier on the battlefield, a diver off an oil
rig or an astronaut on a spacewalk. Under such extreme circumstances,
the welder's trademark tools may soon give way to hair-thin foils that
can fuse two pieces of metal together without oxygen.

<P>The ability to engineer these <A HREF="http://www.llnl.gov/IPandC/opportunities93/06-MATERIALS/Multilayers.html">multilayer</A> foils was patented by Troy
Barbee, Jr., of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and Timothy
Weihs, now at Johns Hopkins University. When exposed to a match flame
or a spark from a battery, the foil releases a momentary wave of
energy and heat sufficient to melt the filler metal used to form a
welded joint.

<P>The foil's hot flash comes about because of the rapid combination
of its constituent atoms. The foils consist of boron, carbon, silica
or aluminum added to a transition metal, such as nickel. "Nickel would
much rather go with aluminum than itself," Weihs explains. The strong
affinity that the different components have for one another leads to a
self-propagating, exothermic reaction that raises the foil's
temperature to 1,600 degrees Celsius in about a millisecond, depending
on the composition and thickness of the layers.

<P>Because the atoms are so close to one another and because of the
speed of the reaction, there is little time for oxygen molecules to
mingle with the metals, resulting in a weak or brittle joint. The
strength of the foil (and hence the quality of the weld) can be
manipulated by changing the thickness of the layers, each of which are
typically five to 2,000 nanometers thick. The thinner the layer, the
stronger the foil, where a "thin" layer is 20 to 25 atoms in
thickness.

<P>Although the idea of using exothermic reactions to join metal is
not new, other techniques have drawbacks. In the thermite process of
welding, for example, aluminum and iron oxide powders must be ignited
with the intense heat from a magnesium torch, and the resulting bond
may be compromised because of the presence of oxygen.

<P>The main drawback to the new foils, however, is the time it takes
to manufacture them. Building a typical one, which would have about
1,000 layers, could take anywhere from eight to 24 hours, Weihs says.
That's because the production involves a costly process called
magnetron sputtering, by which atoms are ejected onto a substrate.

<P>The high cost and the slow rate of production may limit the foils'
use to such low-oxygen environments as underwater or space. But it's
conceivable that someday there will be no more hauling bulky canisters
or hiding behind a mask to safeguard against flying sparks. Welders
may simply need to pack a pair of tweezers.

CHEMICAL ENGINEERING

<center><H2>PLASTIC POWER</H2>

Polymers take a step forward <BR>as photovoltaic cells and lasers
</center>

<P>For nearly 20 years, scientists have expected great things from
semiconducting polymers--chimerical chemicals that can be as pliable
as plastic wrap and as conductive as copper wiring. Indeed, these
organic compounds have conjured dreams of novel optoelectronic
devices, ranging from transparent transistors to flexible
light-emitting diodes. Few of these ideas have made it out of the
laboratory. But in the past year, researchers have added two promising
candidates to the wish list: solar cells and solid-state lasers.

<P>The lasting appeal of these materials--also called synthetic
metals--is that they are more durable and less expensive than their
inorganic doubles. Furthermore, they are easy to make. Like all
plastics, they are long, carbon-based chains strung from simple
repeating units called monomers. To make them conductive, they need
only be doped with atoms that donate negative or positive charges to
each unit. These charges clear a path through the chain for traveling
currents.

<P>Scientists at Advanced Research Development in Athol, Mass., have
made plastic solar cells using two different polymers, polyvinyl
alcohol (PVA) and polyacetylene (PA). Films of this copolymer,
patented as Lumeloid, polarize light and, in theory at least, change
nearly three quarters of it into electricity--a remarkable gain over
the 20 percent maximum conversion rate predicted for present-day
photovoltaic cells. Lumeloid also promises to be cheaper and safer.
Alvin M. Marks, inventor and company president, estimates that whereas
solar cells now cost some $3 to $4 per watt of electricity produced,
Lumeloid will not exceed 50 cents.

<P>The process by which these films work resembles photosynthesis,
Marks explains. Plants rely on diode structures in their leaves,
called diads, that act as positive and negative terminals and channel
electrons energized by sunlight. Similarly, Lumeloid contains
molecular diads. Electrodes extract current from the film's surface.
To go the next step, Marks is developing a complementary polymer
capable of storing electricity. "If photovoltaics are going to be
competitive, they must work day and night," he adds. His two-film
package, to be sold in a roll like tinfoil, would allow just that.

<P>Plastics that swap electricity for laser light are less well
developed, but progress is coming fast. Only four years ago Daniel
Moses of the University of California at Santa Barbara announced that
semiconducting polymers in a dilute solution could produce laser
light, characterized by a coherent beam of photons emitted at a single
wavelength. This past July, at a conference in Snowbird, Utah, three
research teams presented results showing that newer polymer solids
could do the same. "I'm a physicist. I can't do anything with my
hands," says Z. Valy Vardeny of the University of Utah, who chaired
the meeting. "But the chemists who have created these new materials
are geniuses."

<P>Earlier generations of semiconducting polymers could not lase for
two main reasons. First, when bombarded with electricity or photons,
they would convert most of that energy into heat instead of light--a
problem called poor luminescence efficiency. Second, the films usually
absorbed the photons that were produced, rather than emitting them, so
that the polymers lacked optical gain--a measure of a laser medium's
ability to snowball photons into an intense pulse.

<P>Because the newer materials have fewer impurities, they offer much
higher luminescence efficiencies and show greater lasing potential,
Vardeny states. In the <I>Japanese Journal of Applied Physics,</I> his
group described a derivative of poly (<I>p</I>-phenylenevinylene), or
PPV, with a luminescence efficiency of 25 percent. The red light was
composed of photons having the same wavelength, but it did not travel
in a single beam. In <I>Nature, </I>another group from the Snowbird
meeting offered a way around this shortcoming. Richard H. Friend and
his colleagues at the University of Cambridge placed a PPV film inside
a device called a microcavity. Mirrors in the structure bounced the
emitted light back and forth, amplifying it into a focused laser beam.

<P>The third group from Snowbird, led by Alan J. Heeger of U.C.S.B.,
tested more than a dozen polymers and blends as well. Their results,
which appeared in the September 27 issue of <I><A HREF="http://science-mag.aaas.org/science/scripts/display/short/273/5283/1833.html">Science</A>, </I>show that
these materials can emit laserlike light across the full visible
spectrum--even in such rare laser hues as blue and green. In place of
a microcavity, Heeger set up his samples so that the surrounding air
confined the emitted photons to the polymer, where they could
stimulate further emissions. "We wanted to show that a whole class of
materials do this and that they definitely provide optical gain,"
Heeger says.

<P>The challenge now will be finding a way to power these polymers
electrically. All three groups energized their samples using another
laser, but practical devices will need to run off current delivered
from electrodes. It is no small problem. Vardeny notes that electrical
charges generate destructive levels of heat and that electrodes can
react chemically with the film, lowering the polymer's luminescence
efficiency. "It's going to be hard," Heeger concurs, "but I'm
optimistic."

<P><B>Easy Electronic Charging. </B><BR>By spring,
virtual-credit-card-swiping machines are going to become as ubiquitous
as the real ones that now sit on checkout counters. The dominant
player in Internet credit-card authorization will most likely be
<A HREF="http://www.verifone.com/">VeriFone</A>, the company that owns about three
quarters of the domestic market for swipe terminals. VeriFone is now
offering software that is SET-compliant (from "secure electronic
transactions," the protocol worked out by MasterCard, Visa, IBM,
Microsoft and others). The program sends the buyer's encrypted,
digitally signed payment via the Internet to the financial
institution, which then sends the approval codes back to the merchant.
Because the software also verifies the digital signature and
safeguards against tampering, it is the equivalent of the magnetic
strip on a real credit card. The system should reduce the expense of
electronic transactions (credit-card purchases by telephone cost the
merchants more, to cover the possibility of fraud). According to Fred
Kost of VeriFone, Wells Fargo Bank will offer the company's
point-of-sale software to its merchant customers by year's end. The
cost will be about $1,500, which is $700 more than the outlay for a
physical processor, but banks are expected to discount the devices as
they seek to galvanize electronic commerce.

<P><HR><B>Cryptolopes to Go. </B><BR>IBM's Cryptolope containers are digital
wrappers for text and multimedia files sent on the Net; the cryptolope
(for "cryptographic envelope") keeps track of who opens, saves,
forwards or prints the file--and then charges a fee for these
operations. The container presents a summary of its contents--for
instance, an abstract of a magazine article, a music video or Picasso
sketch--followed by the costs and conditions for opening the envelope.
If the user agrees to the terms, a digital key unlocks the encrypted
material. The containers provide a tracking and payment mechanism for
publishers worried about unauthorized distribution of their products
on the Net. "I think of them as digital Styrofoam," says David
Holtzman of IBM infoMarket (the IBM that markets the containers).
"They're a simple encapsulating tool that developers can use to build
complicated commercial systems."

<P>Prices for the containers are set by the owners of the content; IBM
gets a fraction of this fee--what Holtzman calls "a piece of the
click." IBM is showcasing the new technology at its <A HREF="http://www.infomarket.ibm.com/">infoMarket site</A>. So far cryptolope activity is
business to business--for instance, financial analysts buying company
profiles--but by licensing the technology, IBM expects to break into
the consumer market. (America Online will use the envelopes to deliver
software and other digital material.) The technology may also become
the latest incursion of Big Brother into the office: the containers
can provide definitive proof of delivery of memos that one could have
once claimed never to have received.

<CENTER><H2>MANUEL <BR>ELKIN PATARROYO</H2>

<B>The Man Who Would <BR>Conquer Malaria</B></center>


<P>The turn-of-the-century stone building is rotting inside,
floorboards dusty and dilapidated, pigeons roosting in the eaves.
There are no windows in the moldy sills, and weeds are thriving--even
this structure in the middle of Bogot, Colombia, suggests the jungle
is not so very far away. "This is how my buildings always come," says
Manuel Elkin Patarroyo, proud of the efforts that have transformed
other nearby structures into a charming enclave, complete with
gardens, that recall the Pasteur Institute in Paris--a similarity that
delights Patarroyo, because he says that it irritates his rivals
there.

<P>Once restored, this addition to the Institute of Immunology at the
San Juan de Dios Hospital will permit Patarroyo to expand his research
empire and to begin mass-producing the source of his fame and his
controversy: the <A HREF="http://www.who.org/programmes/ctd/diseases/mala/malamain.htm">malaria</A> vaccine SPf66. But the immunologist does not
want to dally in the ruined building and talk about whether the world
is going to want such vast quantities of the compound. The day is
slipping away, it's already 10 o'clock in the morning, and there are
labs to dash through and years of work to review.

<P>Patarroyo has a talent for transforming more than architecture. In
the decade since he appeared on the international immunology scene, he
has ridden innumerable highs and lows. Currently, in the eyes of many
researchers, he is down again--this time for good. The most recent
trial of SPf66 (published in the <I>Lancet</I> in September) failed:
Thai children given several inoculations were no more protected than
those given placebo. This finding follows a 1995 study of young
children in the Gambia that also found the vaccine ineffective.

<P>But Patarroyo has rebounded before. And anyway, to his mind no such
thing as a down period exists--no matter what the studies find. His
spirit is irrepressible, as is his belief that he does not have to
answer his critics, that all will be made clear eventually. "I don't
care. They cannot touch me. It is their problem," he states
emphatically. "My enthusiasm will not leave me for a minute. The
opposite! They don't know what a favor they do me."

<P>Then he is off again, dashing through another lab and sliding down
the length of a hall to answer a telephone. In rapid succession, he
gives a tour of the molecular modeling room, the place where work on
tuberculosis and on leishmaniasis is being conducted, and the
"<I>peptideria,</I>" where the synthesized peptides that form the
basis of the malaria vaccine are stored. He also points out myriad
other labs and the entrance to the restricted area where SPf66 is
made. "I usually arrive at eight in the morning, and I leave at 10
P.M., Saturdays included. It is not unusual for me, because it is as I
want it to be," he says, pausing in front of a mural, one of the many
works given to the institute by famous Latin American artists. "If you
are doing what you want and what you like, you do not feel a tension.
My wife and my family are used to that."

<P>A group of his colleagues passes at that moment, and Patarroyo
ruffles their hair, slaps them on the back, teases them. They laugh
and joke with him. He explains--still for a moment against the
swirling, colorful backdrop of "A Sense of Immunology," by Colombian
painter Gustavo Zalamea--that he sets up competitions in order to get
work done more quickly. He has promised trips to Cartagena, a
beautiful city on the coast, or seats at one of the Nobel ceremony
dinners if his researchers finish projects ahead of schedule. "But I
tell them, 'You son of a gun, if you want to go the Nobel, you have to
buy a tuxedo, because we are not going to be underdeveloped,'
" he
laughs.

<P>Patarroyo refers often to his position as a Third World scientist
in the First World research community. Yet he is in a very privileged
situation. In Colombia, Patarroyo is a national hero; according to a
magazine poll, his popularity exceeds that of his good friend, author
Gabriel Garca Mrquez. His funding is guaranteed by the government,
as is his access to a large population of owl monkeys, some of the
only animals that can serve as hosts for the malaria parasites that
plague humans. Unlike many researchers whose finances are linked to
their results and to being politic, Patarroyo really is free to ignore
his critics.

<P>He is not free, however, to ignore the realities of life in
Colombia--where numerous guerrilla groups vie for power, where the
drug trade bleeds into every activity and where the magic realism of
Garca Mrquez can seem prosaic. This summer one of Patarroyo's
shipments of white powder--that would be SPf66--was replaced with
vials of a quite different white powder. And a few years ago Patarroyo
and his family encountered guerrillas on a drive home to Bogot from
some pre-Columbian ruins. "I was captured for five hours because they
wanted to talk to me," Patarroyo says, making light of the experience,
his voice perhaps more quiet than he realizes.

<P>But what makes him most happy about his notoriety, Patarroyo
continues quickly, is that young Colombians are becoming interested in
science. Another poll pronounced that 67 percent of the nation's kids
want to be scientists. "What other success could I claim better than
that one? To have brought into this country a consciousness,"
Patarroyo exclaims. "So for the children, rather than being Maradonas
[the Argentine soccer great] or rock stars, no! They want to be
scientists, and I think that is very important in our country."

<P>Patarroyo himself had a very particular vision as a youth, as he
tells it: "It was when I was 11, really, that I liked chemistry so
much. And my dream was always to make chemically synthesized
vaccines." His parents were both business people and wanted their
children to be the same; they ended up with five physicians, one nurse
and one child psychologist among their progeny. Although Patarroyo
opposed his parents' business values, he acknowledges that his father
gave him a firm sense that whatever he did, he must be useful to
humankind.

<P>He left his hometown of Ataco, in the Tolima region, to attend
medical school in Bogot. He says that he was a mediocre medical
student and that it was not until his internship at San Juan de Dios
that he understood what science was about. "It was so beautiful to me
to save lives," he muses. "I wanted to make vaccines because I wanted
to be useful."

<P>In the late 1960s Patarroyo went abroad--something he encourages
his researchers to do. After a short stint in virology at Yale
University in 1968, Patarroyo worked in immunology at the Rockefeller
University for several years. He then returned to Colombia, where he
studied various infectious diseases until a colleague urged him to
change his focus. "He said I was an idiot, that I was working on a
problem that was not as important as malaria. Then he gave me the
statistics," Patarroyo recounts as he drives carefully but quickly
through the Bogot traffic to a traditional Colombian restaurant.
Every year as many as 500 million people contract malaria; between 1.5
and three million of them, mostly children, die. Treatment of the
disease is tricky, because strains of the parasite in many regions
have become resistant to the principal drug, chloroquine, and the
alternative, Lariam, increasingly appears to be highly toxic.

<P>Patarroyo's approach to developing a malaria vaccine was unusual.
Instead of creating it from dead or weakened strains of the malaria
parasite, he synthesized peptides identical to those used by the most
virulent strain, <I>Plasmodium falciparum. </I>At the time of
Patarroyo's initial experiments, few immunologists thought
manufactured peptides could produce a strong immune response.
Patarroyo nonetheless tested various peptides for their ability to
produce antibodies in monkeys and settled on four: one used by the
parasite during its larval stage and three used by the mature parasite
to bind to and infect red blood cells. In 1987 he reported that
vaccination protected 50 percent of the monkeys. Controversy
subsequently flared up when investigators could not replicate the
results; Patarroyo claims they used a different compound.

<P>Pausing in the middle of his lunch, Patarroyo starts to sketch a
timeline on a yellow pad, marking the dates of his papers. Right after
his first success, he fell into his first quagmire. "I made a mistake
because of my ignorance in epidemiology," he explains. He decided to
vaccinate Colombians but did not set up a double-blind study. He was
roasted by the scientific community for his methodology and for the
ethics of moving so quickly to human trials.

<P>As other results were reported over the years--the vaccine was
consistently safe but proved inconsistently protective--the community
continued to divide. "He has always been a very intense personality,
provoking strong emotions," notes Hans Wigzell, head of the Karolinska
Institute in Stockholm. "I have been very impressed by his capacity to
press on. His science is like brute force." Wigzell cautions that even
early on Patarroyo "had the feeling that people didn't understand him.
So this is not something that has just popped up. Personally, I like
him."

<P>Even though most studies found the vaccine benefited only about 30
to 40 percent of patients, many in public health were delighted: 30
percent of 500 million is still a great deal. SPf66 was held to a
different standard than other vaccines because of the peculiarities of
malaria: even people who have developed natural immunity to the
parasite often lose it. As major trials in Colombia and then in
Tanzania bolstered the 30 percent or so figure, it seemed as though
Patarroyo was vindicated. In 1995 he donated the rights to the vaccine
to the World Health Organization.

<P>Then came the Gambia and Thailand. Although some immunologists
maintain they are not ready to give up on SPf66, they are frustrated
by the variability of the results. "There has got to be some way of
evaluating why it is or it is not working," comments Louis Miller of
the U.S. National Institutes of Health.

<P>Patarroyo notes that there may be reasons for the inconsistencies:
very young children's immune systems, such as those of the six- to
11-month-olds inoculated in the Gambia, are different from those of
adults; the vaccine used in Thailand may not have been identical to
SPf66; genetic variability determines immune responses. But, he adds,
he is uninterested in point-counterpoint. He just wants to keep going,
studying ways of improving the vaccine and of developing others. That
is the credo of the institute, he insists: "It is the search for the
essence of things. It is not that we are going to develop a malaria
vaccine. It is that we want to develop a methodology. Really to make
vaccines." Then Patarroyo hints that his new research will illuminate
why SPf66 seems so mercurial.

<P>Whatever he may have in the wings, SPf66 remains the only malaria
vaccine in trials, and his work, confounding and controversial, has
enlivened the field. As for Patarroyo, he seems thrilled as always to
be a scientist, thrilled to be directing his laboratory and thrilled
to be free to think and transform. "We are really privileged,
scientists," he says, skipping up the stairs to his office a little
more slowly than usual because of lunch. "We get to have intellectual
development! How many get to have that? Most people have to do things
they don't like."

<center><BR><BR><H1>Dissecting the Brain <BR>with Sound</H1></center>

<I>by Shawn Carlson</I>

<P>In the summer of 1893 Arthur Nikisch, then Europe's premiere
conductor, popped in on the legendary composer Pyotr Ilich Tchaikovsky
to talk a little shop. According to Nikisch's assistant, Richard Lert,
we know only one thing for sure about their get-together: Nikisch
didn't like the way Tchaikovsky had scored the finale of his Sixth
Symphony (the <I>Path&#233;tique</I>), and he adamantly wanted the maestro
to change it.

<P>The contentious passages were certainly unorthodox. Tchaikovsky
alternated the main theme and accompaniment between the first and
second violin sections; as a result, each section played every other
note of each theme. Nikisch wanted Tchaikovsky, who was preparing the
piece for public debut,  to rescore the movement so that the first
violins would play the main theme alone, and the second violins would
play only the accompaniment.

<P>No one knows why Nikisch opposed Tchaikovsky's score so intensely.
He may have rehearsed the <I>Path&#233;tique, </I>and it's tempting to
believe that he did. If so, Nikisch's musical ire might have been
aroused by a peculiar and newly discovered facet of human perception.

<P>The odd score hardly affects a listener today, because the first
and second violins sections sit together; the listener hears both
themes coming from the same region of the orchestra. But 100 years ago
orchestras were arranged differently. The first violins sat on the
conductor's left, and the second violins on the conductor's right.
Standing in the center, Nikisch may have felt as if he were being
battered from both sides by two disjointed sets of sounds that did not
integrate into a harmonious whole.

<P>I say "may have felt" because (here's that peculiar facet of
perception) people don't all hear music in precisely the same way. In
fact, according to Diana Deutsch, a professor of psychology at the
University of California at San Diego, how we perceive certain sound
patterns depends on our native language and whether we are right- or
left-handed. Even our dialect matters: people brought up in California
tend to hear certain sound patterns quite differently from those
reared in England, for example.

<P>The <I>Path&#233;tique</I>'s contentious measures are an example of
this kind of pattern. Most people's brains blend the violins' voices
into Tchaikovsky's intended melodies. Nikisch's singular genius for
conducting, however, suggests an extraordinary precision at discerning
patterns in sound. He may have objected to the score because his ear
was not fooled by the illusion.

<P>Today these mysterious illusions can serve as sonic scalpels for
dissecting the brain and discerning some of its inner workings. Until
now, only a handful of professional scientists have been able to wield
them. But no longer. Deutsch has just created the first collection of
audio illusions on compact disc. Skillfully narrated by Deutsch
herself, "Musical Illusions and Paradoxes" will let you experience
some striking sonic chicanery (<A HREF="http://www.philomel.com">Philomel Records</A>, Box 12189, La Jolla,
CA 92039-2189; telephone: 800-225-1228; fax: 619-453-4763; $14.95plus $4.95 shipping). What is more,
armed with this CD, any amateur scientist can conduct original
research on how the brain processes sound.

<P>I recently visited Deutsch's laboratory and got to experience these
illusions firsthand. My initiation began with the octave illusion.
Through stereo headphones, she played me a simple pattern: two notes
one octave apart alternating from ear to ear so that when the higher
note was played in my right earphone, the lower note appeared in my
left, and vice versa. But that's not at all what I heard. Rather I
perceived a pattern that alternated between a single high note and a
single low note with the high note always appearing in my right ear
and the low note always appearing in my left.

<P>This, Deutsch insists, makes me a typical right-hander. We righties
tend to be dominated by the left hemispheres of our brain. Most of the
signals from my right ear shoot over to my left hemisphere, where
neurons decipher their pitch, and my weaker right hemisphere
predominately processes signals from my left ear. Then, a separate
bunch of neurons deciphers where sounds originate in space. These
neurons tend to rely on frequency to localize sound and thus assign
the source to whichever ear receives the higher pitch. That, coupled
with my left hemisphere's dominance, creates the paradox: when the
high pitch enters my left ear, I can't hear it at all, and I localize
the pitch I do hear (the low pitch) in the wrong ear.

<P>People with more equally balanced hemispheres than I have (most
left-handers and some right-handers) hear the illusion differently. In
fact, left-handers are equally likely to hear the higher tone in
either ear and are twice as likely as right-handers to hear more
complex patterns in which notes change pitch or the higher tone shifts
from ear to ear.

<P>Lowering the right earphone's volume decreases the stimulation
inside the left hemisphere and thereby tilts the scales toward the
right hemisphere. At some point, the illusion changes for even the
most left-brained right-hander. The same trick might suddenly cause a
hemisphere-balanced lefty to perceive the illusion (no one has tested
the possibility yet). The difference in volume between the two
earphones required to change the subject's perception provides a
measure of hemispheric dominance.

<P>Volume control is in this way your first sonic scalpel. Set the
level on the soft side. Adjust the balance knob on your stereo
amplifier until the illusion just changes. Then using a sound meter
(check your local Radio Shack store), measure the sound intensity in
each earphone. Repeat the procedure several times and average the
result. Plot a histogram of this average (see April's column for
information about histograms) for about 30 righties (or lefties), and
you will discover something fundamental about the way brains of
right-handers (or left-handers) are structured.

<P><B>AMBIGUOUS TONE PAIRS</B> are made by combining several notes.
Here D and G# tones that are ambiguous in octave each consist of six D
and G# notes from other octaves (as measured in terms of frequency).
</FONT></td>
</tr></table>

Deutsch's so-called tritone paradox presents more research
opportunities. The paradox uses computer-generated tones constructed
from the same note (say, D); each tone effectively consists of all the
same notes spanning five octaves played simultaneously [<I>see
illustration on the right</I>]. The result is ambiguity: people
perceive the tone as a D but disagree as to which octave it belongs.
The paradox comes about when a second, similarly crafted tone is
played immediately after the first. This second note lies half an
octave, or one tritone, away--equivalent to a musical distance of six
semitones (or six piano keys, including the black ones). So after the
D tone is played, a G-sharp tone would follow. Because neither note
has any octave information, there is no clear answer as to which note
is higher in pitch. Some people insist that the G-sharp is lower than
the D; others hear it as higher.

<P>According to Deutsch, how people perceive this paradox depends on
where they grew up. Californians tend to hear the illusion in a manner
completely opposite to people from the south of England. Furthermore, children tend to hear the
paradox as their mothers do. Apparently, the dialect that one grows up
hearing affects how the brain resolves these tones.

<P>Actually, few data exist on this effect. How do folks from Maine,
or Tennessee, or Nova Scotia, or South Africa respond? Do different
generations show different responses? No one knows. By recording your
friends' responses to the tritone paradox, you can make a real
contribution to science.

<P>My absolute favorite treat from Deutsch's CD is the high-low
illusion. Deutsch first recorded the words "high" and "low." She then
laid down a continuous stereo track in which the words alternate at a
dizzying pace back and forth between the speakers. The result is a
pattern that sounds like language, but the words are not quite
recognizable.

<P>Within a few seconds of listening to this strange cacophony, my
brain started imposing a shifting order over the chaos as I began
hearing distinct words and phrases. First came, "blank, blank, blank."
Then "time, time, time." Then "no time," "long pine" and "any time." I
was then astonished to hear a man's voice spilling out of the right
speaker only. In a distinct Australian accent, it said, "Take me, take
me, take me!"

<P>This illusion suggests more avenues for exploration. See if your
subjects' responses correlate with their beliefs or state of mind.
That may reveal fresh insights into how attitudes affect our
perceptions. Or measure how long it takes for your subjects to hear
"play time" after you suggest it. Let me know what you find.

<P>By the way, Tchaikovsky, who died a few months after the meeting,
refused to give in. Nikisch rescored the contested passages anyway and
thereby created a separate school of performance for this symphony. A
few modern conductors still side with Nikisch and use his revision in
their performances of Tchaikovsky's <I>Path&#233;tique.</I>

<center><H1>The Scientific American Young Readers Book Awards</H1></center>

<I>by Philip and Phylis Morrison</I>

<P>This year we were impressed by the topical freshness of many of the books we saw. The winners we have chosen, on display in these pages, are from a group of about 700 contenders. They will appeal to a wide variety of tastes and needs.

<a name="art"></a>
<P><HR><B>ART AND ARCHITECTURE

<P>Dawn of Art: The Chauvet Cave</B>
<BR><I>by Jean-Marie Chauvet, &#201;Liette Brunel Deschamps and Christian Hillaire</I>
<BR>Translated from the French by Paul G. Bahn. Illustrated. Harry N. Abrams, 1996 ($35)

<P><B>Murals: Cave, Cathedral, to Street</B>
<BR><I>by Michael Capek</I>
<BR>Illustrated in color. Lerner Publications Company, 1996 ($21.50)

<P><B>Architecture and Construction</B>
<BR>Gatefolds, transparent and tracing paper pages. Scholastic, 1995 
<BR>(spiralbound, $19.95)

<P>In <I>Dawn of Art: The Chauvet Cave, </I>the oldest known paintings
in the world are well reproduced, and they are stunning. These
Cro-Magnon artists painted bison, bear, cow, horse, hyena, ibex, lion,
mammoth, rhino and stag. Chauvet Cave murals were already ancient when
the famous cave of Lascaux was freshly painted. Nor is the work
marked by crude technique or simple style; the paintings here are as
sophisticated as any, often making use of the natural bulges of the
rock. A few have been securely dated at 31,000 years before the
present, by direct detection of the radiocarbon in charcoal pigment
from the paintings.

<P>The first book is not for children alone, but rather for everyone.
We hope it will make its splendid way into many homes, classrooms and
libraries. It makes good reading, too, for most of the brief text
among the nearly 100 paintings in full color tells the authors'
personal story. The three friends had been combing the Ard&#232;che Valley
in southeastern France for more than six years when they found this
cave on a "fine and cold winter Sunday" in December 1994. They walked
up an old mule path, stopped to enjoy a wide, sunlit view and saw in
denser vegetation the narrow opening "to a little cavity" six feet
above the ground. They entered to find a small place with a low
ceiling. Going on, removing some rocks, &#201;liette Deschamps wriggled her
way to a chamber whose floor she could make out 30 feet below by her
helmet lamp. Shouts found no quick echo; this was a really big room in
the darkness. They went back to their van to get a long rope ladder,
then returned to climb down to the main level of Chauvet Cave, walking
carefully among what were the ancient remains of many bears until they
spotted the red ocher drawing of a little mammoth. They had reopened
the oldest art gallery in the world.

<P>An epilogue by an archaeologist of the region offers an early
interpretation and compares Chauvet with many other painted caves. It
will take years for experts to complete detailed study. Because of its
fragility, Chauvet cannot be visited by the public save in the
glowing pages of a book like this one.

<P>Not all murals are in dark caves. The second book, by Michael
Capek, is brief and lively for young readers, yet wide-ranging. You
will see and read of gray whales painted nearly life-size five years
back on a powerhouse wall along the coastal highway in Los Angeles. A
grave and marvelous Christ painted large 900 years ago in the dome of
a little Catalonian church is here and also the most celebrated of
ceilings, that of the Vatican's Sistine Chapel executed by
Michelangelo. A theater wall in Atlanta shows Paul Robeson
heroic in the gold epaulets of Emperor Jones. But in Cincinnati a
domed and pillared temple, complete with sweeping circular staircases,
turns out to be only a full-size mural done across a blank wall of a
big grocery warehouse!

<P>Our third recommendation--<I>Architecture and Construction,</I> the
translation of a striking French book--makes elaborate provisions for
reader interaction but names no author. Its opening paintings show the
construction of an ancient Egyptian pyramid and compare it with I. M.
Pei's small, glassy pyramidal entrance to the Louvre Museum. From
there go back to shelters of straw, snow, sticks and hides, the Greek
temples of stone and the brick Coliseum.

<P>Continue on to a castle, the Brooklyn Bridge and the cast-iron
framed glass of London's Crystal Palace, its facade printed on a
transparent sheet. Skyscrapers are next, followed by Fallingwater,
Frank Lloyd Wright's (leaky) masterpiece, with a part of its design on
tracing paper to show how well it fits its complex, hilly setting.
Glossy pages and elaborate foldouts enhance the brief text; a
timeline, references and addresses of architectural sites to visit
and enjoy close this artful book.

<P>The farmers who live on the brick-hard soil in the semiarid lands
of East Africa have always known of long burrows below ground where
small, strange rodents live, eating some of the root crops, forming
mounds of soil here and there, but so thoroughly hidden that they were
rarely seen. Like moles they were burrow dwellers, although their
teeth and tails were like those of rats. They are neither, but a
distinct rodent family, related more to guinea pigs. Strangest of all
was their hairlessness, so that the zoologists named them naked
mole-rats.

<P>Twenty-five years ago Jennifer Jarvis, then a graduate student in
Nairobi, grew curious about how and why the little mammals managed
without fur. She learned how to attract one up into a subsurface
burrow and then blocked its retreat to the depths. Soon she formed new
colonies of her captives and provided a home in a fish tank. At first,
they fought viciously. That stopped, and one adult female grew longer
and began to breed. Over the years she concluded that they were an
organized society. Only one female ever bred; others "kept house,"
cleaning out added dirt and feeding the young, and some of the bigger
animals guarded against predators, mainly snakes.

<P>Meanwhile a theorizing zoologist, Richard Alexander of the
University of Michigan, suggested in some detail how a mammalian
society of the anthill or beehive variety might work. Someone who knew
of Jarvis's work in Africa told Alexander. Soon it was clear that the
essentials of naked mole-rat society were just about what Alexander
had imagined.

<P>A generation of work has opened these strange creatures to our
understanding. Questions multiply: How do they manage without fur? How
does the queen rule? Why don't the others breed? What fixes jobs,
animal sizes, population? How do they sleep, feed, signal? How do they
dispose of wastes and of their dead? How do new colonies form? What
about their genes in inbred colonies of 50 or 100 mole-rat siblings or
half-siblings?

<P>Many clever experiments have given answers. Even in the half-year
since this fine book was put out, exciting new results have appeared.
The mystery is being unraveled, but no one expects the questions to
end. Novices of all ages will appreciate the fact that experimenters
who ask such questions about mole-rats use methods that young readers
can understand. Gail Jarrow is a teacher and writer with a background
in zoology, and her next-door neighbor, Paul Sherman, a Cornell
professor, is a leading researcher on the naked mole-rat. We readers
benefit from their countryside friendship.

<P>Two thousand kilometers southwest of naked mole-rat territory lies
the coastal desert of Namibia. Only fog brings moisture to this arid
region. The cold Antarctic current dries out all on-shore westerlies,
and the east winds from land must cross the steppe and desert of the
Kalahari. Sand is everywhere, and Jim Brandenburg, a gifted
photographer, shows us in <I>Sand and Fog </I>an endless rolling sea
of dunes, both at the scale of one little lizard buried in the hot
sands and in a heroic sweep across a treeless hillscape where a group
of giraffes stands tall amid low green scrub.

<P>People form this place, too. A glittering handful of diamonds have
been harvested from the sands by low-paid gatherers. A young Himba
woman poses, quietly displaying what must be the oldest fashion of our
species; she is covered head to toe in smoothed red ocher, a flower in
her hair. Text and image are often searching, and we face the children
who have encountered unexploded weaponry--and so still bear the wounds
of the lengthy war that has ended, if not yet for them.

<P>Closer to home is <I>Cricketology, </I>a book that fosters a
friendly interaction between children and nature. Most of us recall
lengthy free concerts on crickety summer nights, and many know that
cricket houseguests have been watched and welcomed for 1,000 years in
China. The kids (second to sixth graders) in El Portal Elementary (at
the entrance to Yosemite National Park in California) have furthered
the science of cricketology with the help of their teacher, author
and naturalist Michael Ross and his cricket-wise family. Ross's book
combines a gentle view of insect husbandry with a wonderfully
kid-centered batch of questions to put to your crickets that you may
come to know them better.

<P>Crickets may learn, it appears, after trials of hole-finding speed,
or did they follow their own footsteps somehow? They are attracted by
light, or is it warmth? They hop five times farther from a concrete
sidewalk than from a smooth floor tile. They will tread across water
if they need to escape. Plenty of questions here are left unanswered.
Cricketology is a complicated and exciting study, full of fun, and
kids can advance it and themselves along these lines.

<P>We should also honor Professor A. E. Dolbear of West Virginia, who
just 100 years ago published his formula for telling the temperature
from the rate of tree-cricket chirping.

<P><B>Prehistoric Journey: A History of Life on Earth</B>
<BR><I>by Kirk R. Johnson and Richard K. Stucky</I>
<BR>Denver Museum of Natural History and Roberts Rinehart Publishers, 
<BR>Boulder, Colo., 1995 ($39.95; paperbound, $19.95)

<P>A young girl holds in front of her eyes the smooth, warm brown
pebble she has picked up from the ground. Twenty pages later she puts
it down among yellow flowers in a green field, the subsoil section
visible below, filled with pebbles. Each page of Meredith Hooper's
book bears a landscape and a few lines of text, a dramatic tale of
fiery volcanoes and of mountains rising slowly, slowly, as time and
the weather sculpt pebbles out of the substance of the hills
themselves. A river runs to the sea, and the pebble is rounded as it
rolls. Neither the living forms nor the embedded rocks are permanent
residents; all are passing through, on the way to the bottom of the
sea. Time passes, and life changes; rocks give way to a pebbly
beach, and in turn dinosaurs, then herds of horses, gallop past. The
time of ice quickly makes way for more familiar scenery until the
story is brought up-to-date. "Every pebble has its own story"; pick
one up, and you are a new actor in the long history of the earth.

<P>For all the universality of the earth's history, some times and
places are privileged. The Denver Museum has organized a new set of
eight dioramas, captured in <I>Prehistoric Journey, </I>to show what
is found at the fortunate sites where traces of ancient creatures lie
exposed. The scenes rely on the eloquent witness of photography,
heightened by artists' colorful and careful conjectures.

<P>You can see for yourself the desert scrub of the Ediacara Hills in
the Australian Outback and the impressions in rock of early
multicellular forms. Then comes a flashback to the really old times of
all-bacterial life, with fossil mats of colonies of the unicellulars
and some microscopic details. Ancient fishes and old plants are held
in the perilous cliffs east of Yellowstone.

<P>Life then essays dry land, big Devonian plants and small amphibians
on Beartooth Butte near Yellowstone. Dinosaurs, of course, abound
throughout the fossil sites, as they did in the inland seas that
spanned the American West.

<P>A few more pages grab attention: a 15-foot fish whose sinuous
ribcage holds its final meal; a tree-climbing lemurlike cousin of ours
making its way in the tropical forests of the early Tertiary Rockies,
and the White River Formation of Colorado, where one day in 1994 a
six-man crew from the museum recovered 1,000 mammalian jaws from a
single square mile of outcrop!

<P>There are bigger albums of fossils than this slim volume, and
well-done studies of this or that ancient site, but this book nicely
integrates the story of life's variety and the landscapes where traces
of ancient creatures survive.

<P><B>Jacks around the World</B>
<BR><I>by Mary D. Lankford</I>
<BR>Illustrated in color by Karen Dugan. Morrow Junior Books, 1996 ($16)

<P><B>The Story of Writing: Alphabets, Hieroglyphs and Pictograms</B>
<BR><I>by Andrew Robinson</I>
<BR>Illustrated in color and in black-and-white. Thames and Hudson, 1995 ($29.95)

<P>The first pages of <I>Jacks around the World </I>open to a spread
that holds a bright world map, whereon numbers mark a surprising list
of 14 countries where children play a game related to our own
jackstones. The text that follows begins quite properly, with a
serious two-page piece on the fundamental rules and techniques of
American play. You can learn the finger game called Stone, Scissors,
Paper here if you want a change from tossing a few jacks to determine
the order of play. Just count "one, two, three" and show fingers,
American-style, or try the Japanese chant "<I>ishi, hasami,
kami.</I>"

<P>Around the world, most versions use pebbles, and the rules of
action differ. The Hawaiian game prepares a pile of 100 or so pebbles
and claims them one at a time as your special stone is tossed. Miss
once, and your turn ends--hence, no counting at all. In New Zealand
and Tibet, where sheep and goat flocks are numerous, real knucklebones
and their like are preferred. In Japan and Singapore deft players toss
small bags of silk filled with rice, beads or other seeds. But the
origin of the curious cast-metal spinners with six arms that we call
jacks remains obscure.

<P>Open in design and layout, rich in images--see Napoleon's troops
awed by obelisks and a carved wall--<I>The Story of Writing </I>is a
concise introduction to the vital technology we call writing. The
author is not a linguist, but he is a well-informed and assured
writer.

<P>The book has three sections of increasing length: "How Writing
Works," "Extinct Writing" and "Living Writing." The first makes plain
that there is no "pure" system of writing, no pure pictograph or
ideogram, no road signs, music or math without added words. Any
language can be written, if clumsily, in any script; nontonal Japanese
is about as distinct from tonal Chinese as languages go, yet every
Japanese uses some Chinese script. In Malta the local form of Arabic
is written in English script.

<P>The history of decipherment is fascinating. Ten or so important
written languages remain incompletely or not at all known, from the
Indus Valley signs to the mysterious script of Easter Island and the
stamped letters of the Phaistos clay disk of Crete. Some seem hopeless
unless we find new material to analyze. The last section explains,
very lightly, "the most complicated writing in the world": Japanese.
Multiple scripts, both ideographic and syllabic, are in everyday use.
What people cannot learn to do! And they do it very well, thank you.

<BR><I>by Peter S&#237;s</I>
<BR>Frances Foster Books (Farrar, Straus and Giroux), 1996 ($16)

<P>A collage of collages by a gifted artist and a Nobelist
chemist-poet is not for every young reader. But in high school and
early college years, there are many talented students of both genders
drawn to the arts, delighted by literature and happy with the order
they see in science. The first book is for them and their elders.

<P>Here are nearly 40 mixtures, essays and poems on chemistry and
chemists by Professor Roald Hoffmann and a similar set of apt and
intricate full-page images by the artist Vivian Torrence. They
challenge, instruct, surprise and move. A collage on Marie Curie
centers her portrait on the page, grave as usual, and around it a
sculptor's chisel carving an x-ray image (a woman's hand with a
wedding ring), x-ray spectral data, hydrometric apparatus and a Niels
Bohr atomic diagram of radium orbits. (The long critical essay on
these collages by Lea Rosson DeLong differs a little on the collage's
content.) Hoffmann's accompanying pages evoke the days when he was
10 years old, a "displaced person" in a German camp, an eager child
learning his fourth language and reading two biographies, one of
Marie Curie, one of the American chemist George Washington Carver.
"Years have passed," he writes. "The boy is... older.... The romance
is off the radium.... But Marie Curie still makes him cry."

<P>The Danish physicist Bohr also taught that order is not the only
goal of science. Let the book's diverse novelty guide happy but
perplexed readers.

<P>Confusion of a different kind may beset the young experimenter who
attempts investigations into even the simplest electrostatics in our
age of wall outlets. The San Francisco Exploratorium has collated a
reliable hands-on guide to two dozen experiments that disclose free
electrical charges and much more. All these intimate experiments were
made and tested by schoolteachers who worked from the bigger,
showier and much dearer exhibits of the celebrated do-it-yourself
museum.

<P>Would you like an electrophorus--a longtime carrier of
electrical charge at 10 or 20 sparky kilovolts of potential--easy to
make in 15 minutes out of cheap stuff and tested for workability in
the damp, leaky air of San Francisco Bay? It's here right on the first
pages. Items: an aluminum-foil pie tin, a Styrofoam coffee cup, hot
glue or tape. A Leyden jar? Another small piece of foil, a nail and a
plastic 35-millimeter film can. Drawings along with simple, satisfying
explanatory instructions follow. If you go on, you can make
electroscopes in the same style, detect electrical charge transfer and
show the most basic of facts within matter, the conservation of
electrical charge, merely by pulling apart two pieces of tape. There
are a few others of this series, called Snackbooks, out already, and
more soon to come.

<P>Of course, the path of science is not without its risks, perhaps
greater formerly than now. Galileo is the prototype of the embattled
scholar. In <I>Starry Messenger, </I>Peter S&#237;s recounts with feeling
the life of Galileo, often supported by Galileo's own words (after the
translation of the late Stillman Drake), yet as much from Brecht or
Kafka as from history. This large, thin book of paintings evokes an
old volume in color, form and tone. It opens with the night sky over
Florence and closes with a similar scene over a darkened New York, the
high towers replacing the bulk of the Duomo.

<P>The illustrations are splendid. The golden moon drawings do justice
to Galileo's and yet seem more fit for a Medici prince than
Galileo's own spare wash drawings in sepia. The trial painting is a
stunner. A couple of hundred red-robed cardinals sit all alike in
judgment, every eye of the serried ranks on the philosopher below,
standing alone on a circular floor not unlike the sky that got him
into trouble. News of his final pardon from Rome in 1992 is inset into
a Renaissance map of the constellations. A work of art from cover to
cover, this is a book of rare quality.

<B>The Puzzle Arcade: <BR>For People Who Like Lots of Hints</B>
<BR>BY JERRY SLOCUM
<BR>Varied inclusions and a zippered pouch of puzzle parts. 
<BR>Klutz, Inc., Palo Alto, 1996 (spiralbound, $19.95)


<P>Bent wires, cut-up cards, a grand maze, colorful printing and
breezy but sympathetic prose only begin to describe this book. Its
real nature lies in its ingenious demonstration of the interactivity
of hand, eye, language and form. The author is a renowned collector of
mechanical puzzles, about 20 of which are here; they are accompanied
by picture puzzles, illusions and a gaggle of word puzzles. At the
simplest, a small plastic pyramid can be fitted together of two bits.
Some classical puzzles are offered in new form, like Sam Loyd's famous
movable drawing that shows either 12 or 13 personages. Most important
is not the head-scratching puzzles alone, but the freely offered
help--hints for those who gamely struggle, and then full solutions to
all the puzzles. This open sharing disarms the usual unalloyed
challenge that can injure the sensitive and the unlucky.

<P>One sheet of heavy paper stock offers a colorful map of the
physical world, projected onto 20 flat triangles. Two dozen
straight-line scissors cuts are all that one needs to turn that sheet
into an icosahedron, to be joined with rubber cement at the tabs. Then
you have a bright polyhedral "globe" of the world bereft of cities or
boundaries, bearing a space-age, shaded-relief map in coded color.
This is not a sphere but a pretty good substitute, five inches pole to
pole. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is as clear in light blue as are the
Andes in crimson, for depths and elevations are both keyed. Handling
costs are the only hitch; if three or more friends each want one, the
globe's a bargain.

1995 <BR>(Telephone: 510-658-3453) <BR>($19.95; D cell not included)


<P>Good lab kits pose a tough design challenge. This one displays the
essentials of success: safety, attention to learning by experience and
long smoothing in the hands of many children (the audience here is
grades K through 5 or so). One component is enough to suggest the
welcoming spirit here. A small plastic envelope contains a large paper
clip, two brass paper fasteners and a card labeled SWITCH. Two pages
in the guide show how to make this switch. The hard-working battery
(whimsically cartooned) needs a load--don't short it out! A red LED
glows when properly connected. Alternatively, the load can be a little
motor that turns a pinwheel or a satisfyingly audible buzzer. Make a
test loop and see what does and does not close the circuit: choose a
penny, a bottlecap or an ice cream stick, all included here. Now try a
two-loop version and compare. There are word lists, a game or two and
a fine page to help you troubleshoot.

<H3>MORE WINNERS IN BRIEF</H3>

<B>1 Is for One, </B><BR><I>by Nadia Wheatley. Illustrated by Darius Detwiler. Mondo Publishing, Greenvale, N.Y., 1996 (paperbound, $6.95, three volumes).</I>

<P>This counting book is a diminutive eye-opener to the recursive style that math and language share in echo of the infinite. It is 1 himself, lean, tall and svelte in his blue bow tie, who opens the work by juggling a few digits. Later, 8 sits at dinner but "leaves peas on his plate." At last, we see 1 and 0, tucked in bed cozily at 10:00 P.M.<B> </B>A palm-size book in an envelope on the inside back cover continues the tale. But wait! A third book, the size of a postage stamp, is tucked into the smaller book. This economical, witty and subtly profound work for the early-reading audience has no match.

<a name="igloo"></a>
<P><HR><B>Building an Igloo.</B> <BR><I>Text and photographs by Ulli Steltzer. Henry Holt and Company, 1995 ($14.95).</I>

<P>Tookillkee Kiguktak lives on Ellesmere Island in a house, but when he goes on a hunt for musk ox or polar bear, he builds the igloo as his father taught him. The book walks through the steps: find the right spot, pace off the circular plan, outline and cut the snow blocks. Next it is time to build. Four rows spiral upward, blocks smaller as the top is approached; rounding off with the final dome demands special skill. The photographer has made a precise  and beautiful record of this day's work. 

<a name="comps"></a>
<P><HR><B>Incredible Comparisons.</B> <BR><I>Written by Russell Ash. Illustrated in color. DK Publishing, 1996 ($19.95).</I>

<P>Russell Ash's comparisons, colorfully spread across 60 outsize pages, take us through the universe, line up plenty of speedsters in all media and seek out extremes in population and in the human body. To wit, the diplodocus was three times as long as our longest living land animal, the reticulated python, but today's blue whale outstretches diplodocus and python end to end. All the gold ever mined would make a cubical casting that could stand on a well-reinforced tennis court--and sell for $2 trillion.

<a name="paper"></a>
<P><HR><B>Paper Airplanes and Other Super Flyers,</B> <BR><I>by Neil Francis. Illustrations by June Bradford. Kids Can Press (29 Birch Ave., Toronto, Ontario M4V 1E2), 1996 ($16.95; paperbound, $5.95).</I>

<P>This book tells it straight a dozen times: how to make and fly gliders, twirling-wing papercraft and "strange super flyers" out of supermarket meat trays, small cans and different parachutes. Each plane is presented in step-by-step color drawings. We tested the classical dart, folded of one paper sheet, then added elevators, rudder and ailerons. It flies level and can roll all the way. This is a serious little working guide for grade school friends, clubs and classes.

<a name="sky"></a>
<P><HR><B>The Weather Sky.</B> <BR><I>Photographed, illustrated and written by Bruce McMillan. Sunburst Books (Farrar, Straus and Giroux), paperbound edition, 1996 ($6.95).</I>

<P>A year races by in a couple of dozen wide pages. Each day sampled is given four portions: a photograph in color of the sky, a drawing of the clouds against altitude, a thumbnail segment of a local weather map and a text paragraph describing the physical processes that molded the intricate shapes shown. Cirrus, for instance, floats high and cold, always white because it consists of tiny ice crystals. A helpful seasonal reference, the book is instructive fun for anyone beyond fifth grade. 

<a name="taste"></a>
<P><HR><B>El Gusto del MErcado Mexicano/A Taste of the Mexican Market.</B> <BR><I>Written and illustrated by Nancy Mara Grande Tabor. Charlesbridge Publishing, Watertown, Mass., 1996 (paperbound, $6.95).</I>

<P>How would you present a bunch of bananas on the printed page? Our author-artist has developed a simple yet engaging technique, which she uses to display more than 100 different foods. She snips out banana shapes of yellow paper and arranges them in bunches and pairs for the camera. For shiny fresh fish, she constructs streamlined shapes of crumpled aluminum foil. All the text is printed twice, one page Spanish, the facing page English.

<a name="spot"></a>
<P><HR><B>Spot a Dog, A Child's Book of Art,</B> <BR><I>by Lucy Micklethwait. Illustrated in color. Dorling Kindersley, 1995 ($9.95).</I>

<P>In this beautiful small book, the very knowing author has chosen a baker's dozen of fine paintings, all with canine visitors. Each text page sets one simple question in very big type: Where is the little dog? Can you see a shy dog? To answer, the child needs first to look with care at the entire painting, giving the art time to work its joys on the youngest. Picasso's <I>Three Musicians </I>hides a cubist's flat dog under a chair; the shy dog is in Degas's <I>Dancing Class, </I>just visible between the leg and tulle skirt of the nearest resting dancer.

<P>Make counting big numbers pain-free, even if expressed in those awkward Is, Vs, Xs, and Cs. What you see is a couple of dozen neatly etched and tinted pages crowded with energetic animals--looking at sundials, aloft in a hot-air balloon race, and touring the countryside near their large farm home. Most of the animals are cheerful pigs, MMMMDCCCLXIV of them. The text, including the rules of Roman notation, is all in simple English, so that this book amuses both readers and the read-to. Perhaps it was translated from Pig Latin?

<P>Chimps are not built to speak, but they do communicate vividly, in body tone, gestures, hoots, grunts and kindred verbalizations. These are painted and spelled out here to make a colorful phrase book of youthful chimpanzee; the discourse is far from alien. There are four pages about the art of cooling down, a vocabulary small humans need as well. And most chimps, like their little distant cousins, go to bed quietly, with occasional grunts of contentment: "Eh mmmmmm," eyes shut, thumb in mouth.

<FONT SIZE=+2>CONNECTIONS</FONT>

<BR>by <B>James Burke</B>

<H2>Sweet Dreams</H2>

One of the less glamorous aspects of my work is having to fly frequent
transatlantic red-eyes, and any airline that gives me a sleep-inducing
hot chocolate gets my money. So there I was the other night, droning
up into the sky, sipping and thinking about Sir Hans Sloane. Sloane
helped to establish the place where I do most of my research, when his
collection of 2,500 plants, animals and assorted memorabilia became
the core of what would end up as the British Museum. And it was Sloane
(while spending time in 1688 as personal physician to the governor of
Jamaica) who discovered the soothing effects of mixing chocolate and
warm milk.

<P>Back in England, in 1715, Sloane treated one of the great beauties
and literary wits, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, who was suffering from
smallpox. (She ended up with no eyelashes and a pitted face.) A year
later, when Lady Mary moved to Turkey with her incompetent ambassador
husband and saw what the locals were doing for smallpox (inoculation),
she carried out Turkish-style treatment on her own son. When she went
home, she persuaded various royals to inoculate <I>their</I> kids.
Then, with Sloane's help, everybody else got vaccinated, too.

<P>In 1736 Lady Mary found herself fatally attracted (as were various
other lords and ladies) to an androgynous Italian science type named
Francesco Algarotti, half her age, who was visiting London and doing
for women readers a rewrite of Isaac Newton's work. They fell
hopelessly in love. Well, <I>she</I> did. Three years of one-sided
passion later, Lady M. headed for Italy and a change of air, after
arranging a secret rendezvous with Algarotti. Of course, he never
showed, having gone off to Prussia to be court chamberlain (the
Prussian crown prince Frederick had also apparently fallen for him, to
judge by the fact that he went around referring to Algarotti as the
"Swan of Padua").

<P>Algarotti was a bit of a social climber (you noticed), and so he
must have been tickled pink when his interest in Newton brought him a
social invitation as rare as hen's teeth. It was to stay at the
Ch&#226;teau de Cirey in Lorraine, at which the extremely reclusive
Fran&#231;ois-Marie Arouet Voltaire was holed up with his intellectual
paramour Gabrielle &#201;milie, Marquise de Ch&#226;telet (the French state
security cops were after Voltaire for such misdemeanors as saying
England had a better political system). Each of them was also
producing a version of Newton: he, a general book for lay readers;
she, a rather more demanding commentary on the <I>Principia
Mathematica.</I>

<P>Voltaire also happened to be a big admirer of a pal of Algarotti's:
the Italian priest-experimenter Lazzaro Spallanzani, who (100 years
before Louis Pasteur) noticed that putrefaction did not occur in
hermetically sealed vessels. He also investigated how flat stones
skipped on water, climbed around volcanoes and sliced up thousands of
worms, snails, salamanders and tadpoles to test their regenerative
abilities. He reported the first case ever of artificial insemination
of a spaniel. Above all, Spallanzani made real enemies among the
scientific establishment by rubbishing the popular idea of spontaneous
generation of life (that is, that maggots came from decaying meat,
mice from rotting cheese, and so on).

<P>Spallanzani became so famous that he inspired the wizard-genius
character in one of a collection of creepy pseudoscientific yarns
(full of maniacs, automata, ghosts and such) written around 1815 by a
Berlin lawyer and known, from the author's name, as the <I>Tales of
Hoffmann. </I>Apart from having his story lines snitched by such
operatic biggies as Tchaikovsky and Wagner, E.T.A. Hoffmann's other
main claim to fame was that he defended a pan-German liberal fanatic
by the name of Friedrich Jahn.

<P>The recent defeat by the French had brought German university
student mobs into the streets, calling for a united Germany, free
speech, democracy and other such dangerous lunacy, and Jahn was in
court because much of this stuff was his idea. That, and gymnastics.
Which Jahn saw as the only way to make German youth strong and
disciplined enough for "the struggle ahead." A crackdown on Jahn's
adherents followed his trial, on grounds that exercise might be
detrimental to state security.

<P>After one of Jahn's devotees carried out the spectacular 1819
stabbing of a well-known establishment figure, August von Kotzebue,
freedom of the press was abolished, all universities were taken over
by the state, and another disciple, the athletic liberal Karl Follen
(a close friend of the Kotzebue stabber), fled to Harvard. There he
opened the first college gym in America and started everybody jogging.
By 1851 German-American gymnastics was so widespread that 100 gym
clubs had united as the Socialist Gymnasts' League and were chosen to
provide Abraham Lincoln's bodyguard at his inauguration in 1861.

<P>German gymnastics really took off in the U.S. when the YMCA adopted
physical health as one of its basic tenets and built some of the first
public gyms (and eventually invented basketball to play in them). The
international nature of the YMCA movement had been established as
early as 1855, with a conference held in Paris to cement the charter.
This gathering was the brainstorm of Swiss libertarian and evangelist
Jean-Henri Dunant.

<P>In 1859 Dunant happened to be in Italy watching the one-day battle
of Solferino (people used to picnic on hills next to battlefields and
enjoy the carnage). Dunant was so appalled at the condition of the
6,000 wounded that he fetched buckets of water and 300 citizens and
battle-watching tourists to wash wounds all night. In 1862 the
publication of his book <I>Memories of Solferino</I> led to the
founding of the Swiss Red Cross in 1864. By the end of the century the
Red Cross was on every battlefield, doing everything but blood
transfusions (probably needed by the wounded above all else but which,
when attempted, often seemed to kill rather than cure).

<P>It took the Viennese immunologist Karl Landsteiner to make
transfusions possible. In 1909 he discovered the three main blood
groups--A, B and O--and in doing so revolutionized surgery at a stroke
of the needle. In 1922 Landsteiner moved to the Rockefeller Institute
for Medical Research in New York City and collected a Nobel in 1930.

<P>That same year, in the same place, another Nobel winner,
French-born surgeon Alexis Carrel, who had developed new suturing
techniques that changed the world of blood vessel surgery, took a
major step forward in organ transplantation (for which Landsteiner's
blood-matching discovery was essential). The success followed Carrel's
collaboration with a chap whose sister-in-law had a heart valve
problem that was inoperable because at the time there was no way to
maintain the patient's circulation during the operation.

<P>So when somebody introduced this fellow to Carrel, they became a
dream team. Over the next few years he perfected a new perfusion pump
for Carrel that used compressed gas to keep the necessary fluids
flowing in the body. In 1938 both men made the cover of <I>Time.</I>

<P>The pump maker was used to the publicity, of course, because he was
already world-famous. He was Charles Lindbergh, in 1927 the first
person to fly across the Atlantic and the man who made possible
flights like the one on which I nodded off at the beginning of this
column. Hope you didn't.

<BR>


<P>In 1995, on a whim, I asked a friend: Which would worry you more,
being attacked with a <A HREF="http://www.nbc-med.org/amedp6/PART_II/chapter1.htm">biological weapon
</A>or a <A HREF="http://www.nbc-med.org/fm8_285/PART_I/chapter1.htm">chemical weapon</A>? He
looked quizzical. "Frankly, I'm afraid of <A HREF="http://www.cdc.gov/nchswww/releases/fs_alzhe.htm">Alzheimer's</A>," he replied,
and we shared a laugh. He had elegantly dismissed my question as an
irrelevancy. In civilized society, people do not think about such
things.

<P>The next day, on March 20, the nerve agent <A HREF="http://ensam.inra.fr/chol.cgi-bin/chem_to_netscape.cgi%3FSarin">sarin</A> was <A HREF="http://www.int-review.ch/ang/articles/n40/chem1.html">unleashed in
the Tokyo subway system</A>, killing 12 people and injuring 5,500. In
Japan, no less, one of the safest countries in the world. I called my
friend, and we lingered over the coincidental timing of my question. A
seemingly frivolous speculation one day, a deadly serious matter the
next.

<P>That thousands did not die from the Tokyo attack was attributed to
an impure mixture of the agent. A tiny drop of sarin, which was
originally developed in Germany in the 1930s, can kill within minutes
after skin contact or inhalation of its vapor. Like all other <A HREF="http://www.nbc-med.org/amedp6/PART_III/chapter2.htm">nerve
agents</A>, sarin blocks the action of acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme
necessary for the transmission of nerve impulses.

<P>The cult responsible for the sarin attack, <A HREF="http://www.guardian.co.uk/cults/a-z-cults/a_cults.html">Aum Shinrikyo</A> ("Supreme
Truth"), was developing biological agents as well. If a chemical
attack is frightening, a biological weapon poses a worse nightmare.
Chemical agents are inanimate, but bacteria, viruses and other live
agents may be contagious and reproductive. If they become established
in the environment, they may multiply. Unlike any other weapon, they
can become more dangerous over time.

<P>Certain biological agents incapacitate, whereas others kill. The
<A HREF="http://www.sciam.com/explorations/082696explorations.html">Ebola virus</A>, for example, kills as many as 90 percent of its victims
in little more than a week. Connective tissue liquefies; every orifice
bleeds. In the final stages, Ebola victims become convulsive,
splashing contaminated blood around them as they twitch, shake and
thrash to their deaths.

<P>For Ebola, there is no cure, no treatment. Even the manner in which
it spreads is unclear, by close contact with victims and their blood,
bodily fluids or remains or by just breathing the surrounding air.
Recent outbreaks in Zaire prompted the quarantine of sections of the
country until the disease had run its course.

<P>The horror is only magnified by the thought that individuals and
nations would consider attacking others with such viruses. In October
1992 <A HREF="http://www.miyazaki-mic.ac.jp/students/class98/thamada/shoko.html">Shoko Asahara</A>, head of the Aum Shinrikyo cult, and 40 followers
traveled to Zaire, ostensibly to help treat Ebola victims. But the
group's real intention, according to an October 31, 1995, report by
the U.S. Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, was
probably to obtain virus samples, culture them and use them in
biological attacks.

<P>Interest in acquiring killer organisms for sinister purposes is not
limited to  groups outside the U.S. On May 5, 1995, six weeks after
the Tokyo subway incident, Larry Harris, a laboratory technician in
Ohio, ordered the bacterium that causes <A HREF="http://brooks.mec.edu/%7Ebheun/BubonicPlague.html">bubonic plague</A> from a Maryland
biomedical supply firm. The company, the <A HREF="http://culture.atcc.org/">American Type Culture
Collection</A> in Rockville, Md., mailed him three vials of <I>Yersinia
pestis.</I>

<P>Harris drew suspicion only when he called the firm four days after
placing his order to find out why it had not arrived. Company
officials wondered about his impatience and his apparent unfamiliarity
with laboratory techniques, so they contacted federal authorities. He
was later found to be a member of a white supremacist organization. In
November 1995 he pled guilty in federal court to mail fraud.

<P>To get the plague bacteria, Harris needed no more than a credit
card and a false letterhead. Partially in response to this incident,
an antiterrorism law enacted this past April required the <A HREF="http://www.cdc.gov/">Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention</A> to monitor more closely shipments of
infectious agents.

<P>What would Harris have done with the bacteria? He claimed he wanted
to conduct research to counteract Iraqi rats carrying "supergerms."
But if he had cared to grow a biological arsenal, the task would have
been frighteningly simple. By dividing every 20 minutes, a single
bacterium gives rise to more than a billion copies in 10 hours. A
small vial of microorganisms can yield a huge number in less than a
week. For some diseases, such as <A HREF="http://www.cdc.gov/epo/mmwr/other/case_def/anthrax.html">anthrax</A>, inhaling a few thousand
bacteria--which would cover an area smaller than the period at the end
of this sentence--can be fatal.

<P>Kathleen C. Bailey, a former assistant director of the <A HREF="http://www.acda.gov/">U.S. Arms
Control and Disarmament Agency</A>, has visited several biotechnology and
pharmaceutical firms. She is "absolutely convinced" that a major
biological arsenal could be built with $10,000 worth of equipment in a
room 15 feet by 15. After all, one can cultivate trillions of bacteria
at relatively little risk to one's self with gear no more
sophisticated than a beer fermenter and a protein-based culture, a gas
mask and a plastic overgarment.

<P>Fortunately, biological terrorism has thus far been limited to very
few cases. One incident occurred in September 1984, when about 750
people became sick after eating in restaurants in an Oregon town
called The Dalles. In 1986 Ma Anand Sheela confessed at a federal
trial that she and other members of a nearby cult that had clashed
with local Oregonians had spread <A HREF="http://www.cdc.gov/epo/mmwr/other/case_def/salmonel.html">salmonella</A> bacteria on salad bars in
four restaurants; the bacteria had been grown in laboratories on the
cult's ranch. After serving two and a half years in prison, Sheela,
who had been the chief of staff for the cult leader, <A HREF="http://www.guardian.co.uk/cults/a-z-cults/r_cults.html">Bhagwan Shree
Rajneesh</A>, was released and deported to Europe.

<P>But as a 1992 report by the <A HREF="http://bilbo.isu.edu/ota/indextxt.html">Office of Technology Assessment</A>
indicated, both biological and chemical terrorism have been rare. Also
rare has been the use of biological agents as weapons of war. Perhaps
the first recorded incident occurred in the 14th century, when an army
besieging Kaffa, a seaport on the Black Sea in the Crimea in Russia,
catapulted plague-infected cadavers over the city walls. In colonial
America a British officer reportedly gave germ-infested blankets from
a smallpox infirmary to Indians in order to start an epidemic among
the tribes. The only confirmed instance in this century was Japan's
use of plague and other bacteria against China in the 1930s and 1940s.

<P>As the 20th century draws to a close, however, an unpleasant
paradox has emerged. More states than ever are signing international
agreements to eliminate chemical and biological arms. Yet more are
also suspected of developing these weapons despite the treaties. In
1980 only one country, the Soviet Union, had been named by the U.S.
for violating the 1972 <A HREF="http://www.acda.gov/treaties/bwc2.htm">Biological Weapons Convention</A>, a treaty that
prohibits the development or possession of biological weapons.

<P>Since then, the number has ballooned. In 1989 Central Intelligence
Agency director William Webster reported that "at least 10 countries"
were developing biological weapons. By 1995, 17 countries had been
named as biological weapons suspects, according to sources cited by
the Office of Technology Assessment and at U.S. Senate committee
hearings. They include Iran, Iraq, Libya, Syria, North Korea, Taiwan,
Israel, Egypt, Vietnam, Laos, Cuba, Bulgaria, India, South Korea,
South Africa, China and Russia. (Russian leaders insist that they have
terminated their biological program, but U.S. officials doubt that
claim.)

<P><B><A NAME="1">Grim Reality</A></B>

<P>The first five of these countries--Iran, Iraq, Libya, Syria and
North Korea--are especially worrisome in view of their histories of
militant behavior. Iraq, for example, has acknowledged the claims of
U.N. inspectors that during the 1991 <A HREF="http://www2.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/gulf/index.html">Persian Gulf War</A> it possessed
<A HREF="http://www2.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/gulf/weapons/scud.html">Scud missiles</A> tipped with biological warheads. A 1994 Pentagon report
to Congress cited instability in eastern Europe, the Middle East and
Southwest Asia as likely to encourage even more nations to develop
biological and chemical arms.

<P>Reversing this trend should be of paramount concern to the
community of nations. Indeed, the elimination of biological as well as
chemical weaponry is a worthy, if difficult, goal. The failure of this
effort may increase the likelihood of the development of a man-made
plague from Ebola or some other gruesome agent.

<P>
Dedication to biological disarmament in particular should be
enhanced by another grim truth: in many scenarios, a large population
cannot be protected against a biological attack. Vaccines can prevent
some diseases, but unless the causative agent is known in advance,
such a safeguard may be worthless. Antibiotics are effective against
specific bacteria or classes of biological agents, but not against
all. Moreover, the incidence of infectious disease around the world
has been rising from <A HREF="http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/aboutre.htm">newly resistant strains</A> of bacteria that defy
treatment. In this era of biotechnology, especially, novel organisms
can be engineered against which vaccines or antibiotics are useless.

<P>Nor do physical barriers against infection offer great comfort.
Fortunately, most biological agents have no effect on or through
intact skin, so respiratory masks and clothing would provide adequate
protection for most people. After a short while, the danger could
recede as sunlight and ambient temperatures destroyed the agents. But
certain microorganisms can persist indefinitely in an environment.
Gruinard Island, off the coast of Scotland, remained infected with
anthrax spores for 40 years after biological warfare tests were
carried out there in the 1940s. And in 1981 Rex Watson, then head of
Britain's Chemical and Biological Defense Establishment, asserted that
if Berlin had been bombarded with <A HREF="http://www.emergency.com/anthrax.htm">anthrax bacteria</A> during World War
II, the city would still be contaminated.

<P>Although many Israelis did become accustomed to wearing gas masks
during the 1991 Persian Gulf War, it seems unrealistic to expect large
populations of civilians to wear such gear for months or years,
especially in warm regions. U.N. inspectors in Iraq report that in hot
weather they can scarcely tolerate wearing a mask for more than 15
minutes at a time.

<P>Calls for more robust <A HREF="http://www.gulfwar.org/report/r_1_3.html">biological defense programs</A> have grown,
particularly after the Persian Gulf War. Proponents of increased
funding for biological defense research often imply that vaccines and
special gear developed through such work can protect the public as
well as troops. But the same truths hold for both the military and
civilians: unless an attack organism is known in advance and is
vulnerable to medical interventions, defense can be illusory.

<P>Indeed, the Gulf War experience was in certain respects misleading.
Iraq's biological weapons were understood to be anthrax bacilli and
<A HREF="http://monera.ncl.ac.uk/path/botulin.html">botulinum toxin</A>. (Although toxins are inanimate products of
microorganisms, they are treated as biological agents under the terms
of the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention.) Both are susceptible to
existing vaccines and treatments, and protection of military forces
therefore seemed possible. Research that would lead to enhanced
defense against these agents is thus generally warranted.

<P>But the improbabilities of warding off attacks from less
traditional agents deserve full appreciation. Anticipating that
research can come up with defenses against attack organisms whose
nature is not known in advance seems fanciful. Moreover, even with all
its limitations, the cost of building a national civil defense system
against biological and chemical weapons would be substantial. A 1969
United Nations report indicated that the expense of stockpiling gas
masks, antibiotics, vaccines and other defensive measures for
civilians could exceed $20 billion. That figure, when adjusted for
inflation, would now be about $80 billion.

<P>Vaccines and protective gear are not the only challenges to
biological defense. Identifying an organism quickly in a battlefield
situation, too, is problematic. Even determining whether a biological
attack has been launched can be uncertain. Consequently, the Pentagon
has begun to focus more on detection.

<P>In May 1994 Deputy Secretary of Defense John Deutch produced an
inter-agency report on counterproliferation activities concerning
weapons of mass destruction. Biological agent detectors in particular,
he wrote, were "not being pursued adequately." To the annual $110
million budgeted for the development of biological and chemical
weapons detection, the report recommended adding $75 million. Already
under way were Pentagon-sponsored programs involving such technologies
as <A HREF="http://www.gnet.org/gnet/tech/techdb/gete/DSITMSUM.HTM">ion-trap mass spectrometry</A> and <A HREF="http://mwanal.lanl.gov/Group_Homepages/CST-1#libs.html">laser-induced breakdown
spectroscopy</A>, approaches that look for characteristic chemical
signatures of dangerous agents in the air. The army's hope, which its
spokespersons admit is a long way from being realized, is to find a
"generic" detector that can identify classes of pathogens.

<P>Meanwhile the military is also advancing a more limited approach
that identifies specific agents through antibody-antigen combinations.
The <A HREF="http://www.dtic.mil/defenselink/pubs/armyfact/nbc.html">Biological Integrated Detection System</A> (BIDS) exposes suspected
air samples to antibodies that react with a particular biological
agent. A reaction of the antibody would signify the agent is present,
a process that takes about 30 minutes.

<P>BIDS can now identify four agents through antibody-antigen
reactions: <I>Bacillus anthracis </I>(anthrax bacterium), <I>Y. pestis
</I>(bubonic plague), botulinum toxin (the poison released by botulism
organisms) and staphylococcus enterotoxin B (released by certain staph
bacteria). Laboratory investigations to identify additional agents
through antibody-antigen reactions are in progress. But scores of
organisms and toxins are viewed as potential warfare agents. Whether
the full range, or even most, will be detectable by BIDS remains
uncertain.

<P>The most effective safeguard against biological warfare and
biological terrorism is, and will be, prevention. To this end,
enhanced intelligence and regulation of commercial orders for
pathogens are important. Both approaches have been strengthened by
provisions in the antiterrorism bill enacted earlier this year. At the
same time, attempts to identify and control emerging diseases are
gaining attention. One such effort is <A HREF="http://www.fas.org/promed/">ProMED</A> (Program to Monitor
Emerging Diseases), which was proposed in 1993 by the 3,000-member
<A HREF="http://www.fas.org/bwc/">Federation of American Scientists</A>.

<P>Although focusing on disease outbreaks in general, supporters of
ProMED are sensitive to the possibility of man-made epidemics. The
ProMED surveillance system would include developing baseline data on
endemic diseases throughout the world, rapid reporting of unusual
outbreaks, and responses aimed at containing disease, such as
providing advice on trade and travel. Such a program could probably
distinguish disease outbreaks from hostile sources more effectively
than is currently possible.

<P>In addition, steps to strengthen the 1972 Biological Weapons
Convention through verification arrangements--including on-site
inspections--should be encouraged. The 139 countries that are parties
to the convention are expected to discuss incorporating verification
measures at a review conference in December of this year. After the
last review conference, in 1991, a committee to explore such measures
was established. <A HREF="http://www.fas.org/bwc/verex.html">VEREX</A>, as the group was called, has listed various
possibilities ranging from surveillance of the scientific literature
to on-site inspections of potential production areas, such as
laboratories, breweries and pharmaceutical companies. Given the ease
with which bioweapons can be produced, individuals will always be able
to circumvent international agreements. But the absence of such agents
from national arsenals--and tightened regulations on the acquisition
and transfer of pathogens--will make them more difficult to obtain for
hostile purposes. Verification can never be foolproof, and therefore
some critics argue that verification efforts are a waste of time.
Proponents nonetheless assert that sanctions following a detected
violation would provide at least some disincentive to cheaters and are
thus preferable to no sanctions at all. Furthermore, a strengthened
global treaty underscores a commitment by the nations of the world not
to traffic in these weapons.

<P>The infrequent use of biological weapons to date might be explained
in many ways. Some potential users have probably lacked familiarity
with how to develop pathogens as weapons; moreover, they may have been
afraid of infecting themselves. Nations and terrorists alike might
furthermore be disinclined to use bioagents because they are by nature
unpredictable. Through mutations, a bacterium or virus can gain or
lose virulence over time, which may be contrary to the strategic
desires of the people who released it. And once introduced into the
environment, a pathogen may pose a threat to anybody who goes there,
making it difficult to occupy territory.

<P>But beneath all these pragmatic concerns lies another dimension
that deserves more emphasis than it generally receives: the moral
repugnance of these weapons. Their ability to cause great suffering,
coupled with their indiscriminate character, no doubt contributes to
the deep-seated aversion most people have for them. And that aversion
seems central to explaining why bioweapons have so rarely been used in
the past. Contrary to analyses that commonly ignore or belittle the
phenomenon, this natural antipathy should be appreciated and
exploited. Even some terrorists could be reluctant to use a weapon so
fearsome that it would permanently alienate the public from their
cause.

<P><B><A NAME="2">The Poison Taboo</A></B>

<P>In  recognition of these sentiments, the 1972 Biological Weapons
Convention describes germ weaponry as "repugnant to the conscience of
mankind." Such descriptions have roots that reach back thousands of
years. (Not until the 19th century were microorganisms understood to
be the cause of infection; before then, poison and disease were
commonly seen as the same. Indeed, the Latin word for "poison" is
"virus.")

<P>Among prohibitions in many civilizations were the poisoning of food
and wells and the use of poison weapons. The Greeks and Romans
condemned the use of poison in war as a violation of <I>ius
gentium</I>--the law of nations. Poisons and other weapons considered
inhumane were forbidden by the Manu Law of India around 500 B.C. and
among the Saracens 1,000 years later. The prohibitions were reiterated
by Dutch statesman Hugo Grotius in his 1625 opus <I>The Law of War and
Peace, </I>and they were, for the most part, maintained during the
harsh European religious conflicts of the time.

<P>Like the taboos against incest, cannibalism and other widely
reviled acts, the taboo against poison weapons was sometimes violated.
But the frequency of such violations may have been minimized because
of their castigation as a "defalcation of proper principles," in the
words of the 18th- and 19th-century English jurist Robert P. Ward.
Under the law of nations, Ward wrote, "Nothing is more expressly
forbidden than the use of <I>poisoned </I>arms" (emphasis in
original).

<P>Historian John Ellis van Courtland Moon, now professor emeritus at
Fitchburg State College in Massachusetts, contends that growing
nationalism in the 18th century weakened the disinclinations about
poison weapons. As a result of what Moon calls "the nationalization of
ethics," military necessity began to displace moral considerations in
state policies; nations were more likely to employ any means possible
to attain their aims in warfare.

<P>In the mid-19th century, a few military leaders proposed that toxic
weapons be employed, although none actually were. Nevertheless, gas
was used in World War I. The experience of large-scale chemical
warfare was so horrifying that it led to the <A HREF="http://fas-www.harvard.edu:80/%7Ehsp/1925.html">1925 Geneva Protocol</A>,
which forbids the use of chemical and bacteriological agents in war.
Images of victims gasping, frothing and choking to death had a
profound impact. The text of the protocol reflects the global sense of
abhorrence. It affirmed that these weapons had been "justly condemned
by the general opinion of the civilized world."

<P>Chemical and biological weapons were used in almost none of the
hundreds of wars and skirmishes in subsequent decades--until Iraq's
extensive chemical attacks during the Iran-Iraq war. Regrettably, the
international response to Iraqi behavior was muted or ineffective.
From 1983 until the war ended in 1988, Iraq was permitted to get away
with chemical murder. Fear of an Iranian victory stifled serious
outcries against a form of weaponry that had been universally
condemned.

<P>The consequences of silence about Iraq's behavior, though
unfortunate, were not surprising. Iraqi ability to use chemical
weapons with impunity, and their apparent effectiveness against Iran,
prompted more countries to arm themselves with chemical and biological
weapons. Ironically, in 1991 many of the <A HREF="http://www.sipri.se/projects/armstrade/G-7_Declaration_July_1991.html">countries that had been
silent</A> about the Iraqi chemical attacks had to face a chemically and
biologically equipped Iraq on the battlefield.

<P>To its credit, since the Persian Gulf War, much of the
international community has pressed Iraq about its unconventional
weapons programs by maintaining sanctions through the <A HREF="http://www.un.org/Overview/Organs/sc.html">U.N. Security
Council</A>. Council resolutions require elimination of Iraq's biological
weapons (and other weapons of mass destruction), as well as
information about past programs to develop them. Iraq has been <A HREF="http://www.aipac.org/hot/MiddleEast/neriraq.html">only
partially forthcoming</A>, and U.N. inspectors continue to seek full
disclosure.

<P>But even now, U.N. reports are commonly dry recitations.
Expressions of outrage are rare. Any country or group that develops
these weapons deserves forceful condemnation. We need continuing
reminders that civilized people do not traffic in, or use, such
weaponry. The agreement by the U.S. and Russia to <A HREF="http://bicc.uni-bonn.de/weapons/brief3/chap3.html">destroy their
chemical stockpiles</A> within a decade should help.

<P>Words of outrage alone, obviously, are not enough. Intelligence is
important, as are controls over domestic and international shipments
of pathogens and enhanced global surveillance of disease outbreaks.
Moreover, institutions that reinforce positive behavior and values are
essential.

<P>The highest priority of the moment in this regard is implementation
of the <A HREF="http://www.sipri.se/projects/group-cw/CWCrtf.html">Chemical Weapons Convention</A>, which outlaws the possession of
chemical weapons. It lists chemicals that signatory nations must
declare to have in their possession. Unlike the Biological Weapons
Convention, the chemical treaty has extensive provisions to verify
compliance, including short-notice inspections of suspected
violations. It also provides added inducements to join through
information exchanges and commercial privileges among the signatories.

<P>In 1993 the chemical treaty was opened for <A HREF="http://www.opcw.nl/memsta/ratifyer.htm">signature</A>. By October
1996, the pact had been signed by 160 countries and ratified by 64,
one less than the number required for the agreement to enter into
force. One disappointing holdout is the U.S. In part because of
disagreements over the treaty's verification provisions, the <A HREF="http://www.stimson.org/pub/stimson/cwc/inactadv.htm">U.S.
Senate recently delayed</A> a vote on the pact.

<P>Implementing this chemical weapons treaty should add momentum to
the current negotiations over strengthening the Biological Weapons
Convention. Conversely, failure of the Chemical Weapons Convention to
fulfill expectations will dampen prospects for a verification regime
for the biological treaty. The most likely consequence would be the
continued proliferation of chemical and biological arsenals around the
world. The longer these weapons persist, the more their sense of
illegitimacy erodes, and the more likely they will be used--by armies
and by terrorists.

<P>As analysts have noted, subnational groups commonly use the types
of weapons that are in national arsenals. The absence of biological
and chemical weapons from national military inventories may diminish
their attractiveness to terrorists. According to terrorism expert
Brian M. Jenkins, leaders of Aum Shinrikyo indicated that their
interest in chemical weapons was inspired by Iraq's use of chemicals
during its war with Iran.

<P>Treaties, verification regimes, global surveillance, controlled
exchanges of pathogens--all are the muscle of arms control. Their
effectiveness ultimately depends on the moral backbone that supports
them and the will to enforce them rigorously. By underscoring the
moral sense behind the formal exclusion of biological weapons,
sustaining their prohibition becomes more likely.

<P>The <A HREF="http://csep1.phy.ornl.gov/guidry/violence/bang.html">big bang</A> model of the early universe is extraordinarily simple:
it has no structure of any kind on scales larger than individual
<A HREF="http://www.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/%7Epprint/particles.html">elementary particles</A>. 
Even though the behavior it predicts is governed
only by <A HREF="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/%7Ehistory/HistTopics/General_relativity.html">general relativity</A>, the <A HREF="http://pdg.lbl.gov/cpep/standard_model.html">Standard Model</A> of elementary particle
physics and the energy distribution rules of basic thermodynamics, it
appears to describe the primordial fireball almost perfectly.

<P><A HREF="http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/html/bbn.html">Atomic nuclei that formed</A> during the first seconds and minutes of
the universe provide additional clues to events in the early universe
and to its composition and <A HREF="http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/html/structure.html">structure today</A>. The big bang produced a
universe made almost entirely of <A HREF="http://www2.ari.net/home/odenwald/qadir/q1479.html">hydrogen and helium</A>. Deuterium, the
heavy isotope of hydrogen, was made only at the beginning of the
universe; thus, it serves as a particularly important marker. The
<A HREF="http://physics7.berkeley.edu/darkmat/bbn.html">
</A> atoms depends strongly on both
the uniformity of matter and the total amount of matter formed in the
big bang. During the past few years, astronomers have for the first
time begun to make reliable, direct measurements of deuterium in
ancient gas clouds. Their results promise to provide a precise test of
the big bang cosmogony. 

<P>The expansion of the universe appears to have
started <A HREF="http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/html/age.html">between 10 and 20 billion years ago</A>. Everything was much
closer together and much denser and hotter than it is now. When the
universe was only one second old, its temperature was more than 10
billion degrees, 1,000 times hotter than the center of the sun. At
that temperature, the <A HREF="http://www2.ari.net/home/odenwald/anthol/planck.html">distinctions</A> between different kinds of matter
and energy were not as definite as they are under current conditions:
subatomic particles such as neutrons and protons constantly changed
back and forth into one another, "cooked" by interactions with
plentiful and energetic electrons, positrons and neutrinos. Neutrons
are slightly heavier than protons, however; as things cooled, most of
the matter settled into the more stable form of protons. As a result,
when the temperature fell below 10 billion degrees and the
intertransmutation stopped, there were about seven times as many
protons as neutrons.

<B><A NAME="1">Out of the Primordial Furnace</A></B>

<P>When the universe was a few minutes old (at a temperature of about
one billion degrees), the protons and neutrons cooled down enough to
stick together into nuclei. Each neutron found a proton partner,
creating a pair called a deuteron, and almost all the deuterons in
turn stuck together into helium nuclei, which contain two protons and
two neutrons. By the time <A HREF="http://spot.colorado.edu/%7Ehpark/archives/95-6/2.html">primordial helium</A> had formed, the density of
the universe was too low to permit further fusion to form heavier
elements in the time available; consequently, almost all the neutrons
were incorporated into helium.

<P>Without neutrons to hold them together, protons cannot bind into
nuclei because of their electrical repulsion. Because of the limited
neutron supply in the primordial fireball, six of every seven protons
must therefore remain as isolated hydrogen nuclei. Consequently, the
big bang model predicts that about one quarter of the mass of the
normal matter of the universe is made of helium and the other three
quarters of hydrogen. This simple prediction accords remarkably well
with observations. Because hydrogen is the principal <A HREF="http://www.imsa.edu/%7Eastrostu/team1proj3/">fuel of the stars</A>
of the universe, its predominance is the basic reason for starlight
and sunlight.

<P>During the formation of helium nuclei, perhaps only one in 10,000
deuterons remained unpaired. An even smaller fraction fused into
nuclei heavier than helium, such as <A HREF="http://www2.ari.net/home/odenwald/qadir/q1653.html">lithium</A>. (All the other familiar
elements, such as carbon and oxygen, were produced much later inside
stars.) The exact percentages of helium, deuterium and lithium depend
on only one parameter: the ratio of protons and neutrons--particles
jointly categorized as <A HREF="http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/html/comp.html">baryons</A>--to photons. The value of this ratio,
known as <I>n</I> (the Greek letter eta), remains essentially constant as the
universe expands; because we can measure the number of photons,
knowing <I>n</I> tells us how much matter there is. This number is important
for understanding the later <A HREF="http://csep1.phy.ornl.gov/guidry/violence/galaxies-evol.html">evolution</A> of the universe, because it can
be compared with the actual amount of matter seen in stars and gas in
<A HREF="http://csep1.phy.ornl.gov/guidry/violence/galaxies-info.html">galaxies</A>, as well as the larger amount of unseen <A HREF="http://csep1.phy.ornl.gov/guidry/violence/darkmatter.html">dark matter</A>.

<P>For the big bang to make the observed mix of light elements, <I>n</I> must
be very small. The universe contains fewer than one baryon per billion
photons. The temperature of the <A HREF="http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/html/cbr.html">cosmic background radiation</A> tells us
directly the number of photons left over from the big bang; at
present, there are about 411 photons per cubic centimeter of space.
Hence, baryons should occur at a density of somewhat less than 0.4 per
cubic meter. Although cosmologists know that <I>n</I> is small, estimates of
its exact value currently vary by a factor of almost 10. The most
precise and reliable indicators of <I>n</I> are the concentrations of
primordial light elements, in particular deuterium. A fivefold
increase in <I>n</I>, for example, would lead to a telltale 13-fold decrease
in the amount of deuterium created.

<P>The mere presence of deuterium sets an upper limit on <I>n</I> because the
big bang is probably the primary source of deuterium in the universe,
and later processing in stars gradually destroys it. One can think of
deuterium as a kind of partially spent fuel like charcoal, left over
because there was originally not time for all of it to burn completely
to ash before the fire cooled. <A HREF="http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/html/bbn.html">Nucleosynthesis</A> in the big bang lasted
only a few minutes, but the nuclear burning in stars lasts for
millions or billions of years; as a result, any deuterium there is
converted to helium or heavier elements. All the deuterium that we
find must therefore be a remnant of the big bang--even the one
molecule in 10,000 of seawater that contains a deuterium atom in place
of a hydrogen atom.

<B><A NAME="2">Quasars and Gas Clouds</A></B>

<P>Determining the primordial ratio of deuterium to ordinary hydrogen
should be highly informative, but it is not easy, because the universe
is not as simple as it used to be. Astronomers can measure deuterium
in clouds of atomic hydrogen gas between the stars of our galaxy, but
the element's fragility renders the results suspect. We live in a
polluted, dissipated, middle-aged galaxy whose gases have undergone a
great deal of chemical processing over its 10-billion-year history.
Deuterium is very readily destroyed in stars, even in their outer
layers and their early prestellar evolution. <A HREF="http://ast.star.rl.ac.uk/pn.html">Stars eject their
envelopes when they die</A>, and the <A HREF="http://www.stsci.edu/pubinfo/PR/95/44.html">gas in our galaxy</A> has been in and out
of stars many times. As a result, looking at nearby gas clouds can
suggest only a lower limit to primordial deuterium abundance.

<P>It would be much better if one could get hold of some truly
pristine primordial material that had never undergone chemical
evolution. Although we cannot bring such matter into the laboratory,
we can look at its composition by its effect on the spectrum of light
from distant sources. Bright <A HREF="http://www.kingsu.ab.ca/%7Ebrian/astro/chp14.htm">quasars</A>, the most luminous objects in the
universe, are so far away that the light we see now left them when the
universe was only one sixth to one quarter of its present size and
perhaps only a tenth of its <A HREF="http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/html/age.html">present age</A>. On its way to us, the light
from these quasars passes through clouds of gas that have not yet
condensed into mature galaxies, and the light absorbed by these clouds
gives clues to their composition. Some of the clouds that have been
detected contain less than one thousandth the proportion of carbon and
silicon (both stellar fusion products) seen in nearby space, a good
sign that they retain very nearly the composition they had immediately
after the big bang.


<P>There is another advantage to looking so far away. The main
component of these clouds, atomic hydrogen, absorbs light at a sharply
defined set of ultraviolet wavelengths known as the <A HREF="http://www.chem.ualberta.ca/courses/plambeck/p101/p01214.htm">Lyman series</A>. Each
of these absorption lines (so called because of the dark line it
leaves in a spectrum) corresponds to the wavelength of a photon
exactly energetic enough to excite the electron in a hydrogen atom to
a particular energy level. These lines have colors that lie deep in
the ultraviolet and cannot usually be seen from the ground because of
atmospheric absorption; even the reddest (and most prominent) line,
Lyman alpha, appears at a wavelength of 1,215 angstroms. Luckily, the
expansion of the universe causes a "cosmological redshift" that
lengthens the wavelengths of photons that reach the earth to the point
where hydrogen absorption lines from sufficiently distant gas clouds
reside comfortably within the visible range.

<P>Lyman alpha appears in light from a typical quasar hundreds of
times, each time from a different cloud along the line of sight at a
different redshift and therefore at a different wavelength. The
resulting spectrum is a slice of cosmic history, like a tree-ring
sample or a Greenland ice core: these <A HREF="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/%7Erme/intro.html">quasar absorption spectra</A> record
the history of the conversion of uniform gas from the early big bang
into the discrete galaxies we see today over an enormous volume of
space. This multiplicity of spectra offers another way to test the
primordial character of the absorbing material: the big bang model
predicts that all gas clouds from the early universe should have more
or less the same composition. Measuring the abundances of different
clouds at vast distances from us and from one another in both time and
space will directly test <A HREF="http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/html/fluct.html">cosmic uniformity</A>.

<P>In some of these clouds, we can determine from the quasar spectra
both how much ordinary hydrogen there is and how much deuterium. We
can separate the signal from deuterium because the added mass in the
deuterium nucleus increases the energy required for atomic transitions
by about one part in 4,000 (twice the ratio of a proton's mass to an
electron's mass). As a result, the absorption spectrum of deuterium is
similar to that of single-nucleon hydrogen, but all the lines show a
shift toward the blue end of the spectrum equivalent to that arising
from a motion of 82 kilometers per second toward the observer. In
<A HREF="http://csep1.phy.ornl.gov/guidry/violence/spectroscopy.html">spectrographic measurements</A> of a hydrogen cloud, <A HREF="http://www.astro.washington.edu/rugers/Dl/node1.html">deuterium registers</A>
as a faint blue-shifted "echo" of the hydrogen.

<P>These spectra also record the velocity and temperature distribution
of the atoms. Atoms traveling at different velocities absorb light at
slightly different wavelengths because of the <A HREF="http://zebu.uoregon.edu/%7Esoper/Light/doppler.html">Doppler effect</A>, which
alters the apparent wavelength of light according to the relative
motion of transmitter and receiver. Random thermal motions impel the
hydrogen atoms at speeds of about 10 kilometers per second, causing a
wavelength shift of one part in 30,000; because they are twice as
heavy, deuterium atoms at the same temperature move at only about
seven kilometers per second and therefore have a slightly different
velocity distribution. A modern spectrograph can resolve these thermal
velocity differences, as well as larger-scale collective flows.

<P><B><A NAME="3">Waiting for the Light</A></B>

<P>Although spectrographs can easily resolve the wavelength
differences between ordinary hydrogen and deuterium, splitting the
light of a distant <A HREF="http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/html/first.html">quasar</A> into 30,000 colors leaves very little
intensity in each color. For more than 20 years, these observations
proved too difficult. Many of us have spent long nights waiting for
photons to drip one by one onto the detectors of the world's largest
telescopes, only to find that the weather, instrument problems and,
ultimately, just lack of time had prevented the accumulation of enough
light for a convincing result. The technique is now practical only
because of improved, more efficient detectors, the 10-meter <A HREF="http://astro.caltech.edu/observatories/keck/bluebook.html">Keck
telescope</A> in Hawaii and advanced high-resolution, high-throughput
spectrographs such as the Keck HIRES.

<P>After many unsuccessful attempts on smaller telescopes, my
colleagues <A HREF="http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/faculty/acowie/">Antoinette Songaila</A> and Lennox L. Cowie of the
<A HREF="http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/ifa/ifa.html">University
of Hawaii</A> were allocated their university's first science night on the
Keck Telescope for this project in November 1993. They trained the
telescope on a quasar known as <A HREF="http://www.aas.org/ApJ/v459n1/5639/5639.html">0014+813</A>, famous among astronomers for
its brightness--indeed, it was for some years the brightest single
object known in the universe. From earlier studies by Ray J. Weymann
of the Observatories of the Carnegie Institution of Washington and
Frederic Chaffee, <A HREF="http://sculptor.as.arizona.edu/foltz/www/craig.html">Craig B. Foltz</A> and <A HREF="http://qso.as.arizona.edu/%7Ejill/jill.html">Jill Bechtold</A> of 
the <A HREF="http://www.arizona.edu/">University
of Arizona</A> and their collaborators, we knew that a fairly pristine gas
cloud lay in front of this quasar.

<P>The first Keck spectrum, obtained in only a few hours, was already
of sufficiently high quality to show plausible signs of cosmic
deuterium. That spectrum showed the absorption pattern for hydrogen
gas moving at various velocities, and it showed an almost perfect echo
of the Lyman alpha line with the characteristic blueshift of
deuterium. The amount of absorption in this second signal would be
caused by about two atoms of deuterium per 10,000 atoms of hydrogen.
The result has since been independently confirmed by Robert F.
Carswell of the <A HREF="http://www.cam.ac.uk/">University of Cambridge</A> and his colleagues, using data
from the four-meter <A HREF="http://www.noao.edu/kpno/techpamph/obs.html">Mayall Telescope</A> at the 
<A HREF="http://www.noao.edu/kpno/kpno.html">Kitt Peak National
Observatory</A> in Arizona. Subsequent analysis has revealed that the
deuterium absorption indeed displays an unusually narrow thermal
spread of velocities, as expected.

<P>It is possible that some of the absorption we saw was caused by a
chance interposition of a small hydrogen cloud that just happens to be
receding from us at 82 fewer kilometers per second than the main cloud
we observed. In that case, the deuterium abundance would be less than
we think. Although the a priori chance of such a coincidence on the
first try is small, we ought to regard this estimate as only
preliminary. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of the technique is
clear. Absorbing clouds in front of many other quasars can be studied
with the new technology; we will soon have a statistical sampling of
deuterium in primordial material. In fact, our group and others have
now published measurements and limits for eight different clouds.

<P>One of the most intriguing results is a <A HREF="http://nately.ucsd.edu/%7Escott/Papers/dh.1937.pp/index.html">measurement</A> by <A HREF="http://sdphul.ucsd.edu/dept/pr/faculty/dt.html">David Tytler</A>
and <A HREF="http://nately.ucsd.edu/%7Escott/Welcome.html">Scott Burles</A> of the 
<A HREF="http://cassfos01.ucsd.edu:8080/index.html">University of California at San Diego</A> and
<A HREF="http://nately.ucsd.edu/%7Efan/welcome.html">Xiao-Ming Fan</A> of Columbia University, who 
have found a ratio that is
apparently almost a factor of 10 lower than our estimate. It remains
to be seen whether their result represents the true primordial value.
The lower abundance might be a result of deuterium burning in early
stars or a sign that the production of deuterium was perhaps not as
uniform as the big bang model predicts.

<B><A NAME="4">Clues to Dark Matter</A></B>

<P>If our higher value is correct, the amount of primordial deuterium
would fit very well with the standard predictions of the big bang
model for a value of <I>n</I> around two baryons per 10 billion photons. With
this value of <I>n</I>, the big bang predictions are also consistent with the
amounts of lithium in the oldest stars and estimates of primordial
helium seen in nearby metal-poor galaxies. Confirmation of this result
would be fabulous news. It would verify that cosmologists understand
what happened only one second after the beginning of the expansion of
the universe. In addition it would indicate that the history of matter
at great distances is like that of nearby matter, as assumed in the
simplest possible model of the universe.

<P>This estimate of <I>n</I> fits reasonably well with the number of baryons
we actually see in the universe today. The observed density of photons
calls for about one atom for every 10 cubic meters of space. This is
about the same as the number of atoms counted directly by adding up
all the matter in the known gas, stars, planets and dust, including
the quasar absorbers themselves; there is not a huge reservoir of
unseen baryons. At the same time, observations suggest that an
enormous quantity of dark matter is necessary to explain the
<A HREF="http://physics7.berkeley.edu/darkmat/galrotcurve.html">gravitational behavior of galaxies</A> and their halos--at least 10 times
the mean density of the visible baryons. Thus, our high deuterium
abundance indicates that this mass is not made of ordinary atomic
matter.

<P>Cosmologists have proposed many candidates for such nonbaryonic
forms of dark matter. For example, the big bang predicts that the
universe has almost as many neutrinos left over as photons. If each
one had even a few billionths as much mass as a proton (equivalent to
a few electron volts), <A HREF="http://www.physics.ucsb.edu/research/snm.html">neutrinos</A> would contribute to the universe
roughly as much mass as all the baryons put together. It is also
possible that the early universe created some kind of leftover
particle that we have not been able to produce in the laboratory.
Either way, the big bang model, anchored by observation, provides a
framework for predicting the astrophysical consequences of such new
physical ideas.

<B>POETIC SCIENCE</B>
<P>The illustration on your July cover, for Stephen W. Hawking and Roger
Penrose's article <A HREF="../0796issue/0796hawking.html">"The Nature of Space and Time,"</A> reminds me of a beautiful
quatrain from the prologue to <I>Hellas, A Lyrical Drama, </I>written in 1821 by
Percy B. Shelley, the English Romantic:
<blockquote>
<P>The curtain of the Universe
<BR>Is rent and shattered,
<BR>The splendor-wing&#232;d worlds disperse
<BR>Like wild doves scattered.
</blockquote>
<P><I>Thomas A. Reisner <BR>Laval University, Quebec, Canada</I>
<P><HR>
<B>THEORIES OF EXTINCTION</B>
<P>In his article "The Mother of Mass Extinctions" [July], Douglas H. Erwin
suggests that the end-Permian mass extinction may have resulted from an abrupt
drop in sea level. But new evidence increasingly constrains the time frame for
the extinction, calling for a much more rapid mechanism. If an extraterrestrial
cause (a comet or asteroid) is ruled out, a fast-acting terrestrial cause must be
responsible. Heat from the main pulse of the Siberian traps could have abruptly
released large quantities of methane. Although the lethal gas would have remained
in the atmosphere for only about a decade before being converted to carbon
dioxide and water, the methane--together with the resulting high levels of carbon
dioxide--could have been responsible for the extinction event.
<P><I>Dan Dorritie <BR>University of California at Davis</I>
<P>Erwin discussed various theories about the end-Permian mass extinction,
including the intriguing volcano hypothesis. Although aerosols emitted by
volcanoes do temporarily diminish the ozone layer, theoretically allowing more
ultraviolet radiation to reach the earth's surface, levels of ultraviolet B
radiation actually seem to decrease after a volcanic eruption. Apparently, the
aerosols block the rays fairly efficiently. (Particles in smoke and severe air
pollution also block rays of ultraviolet B.) It also turns out that ultraviolet B
radiation is an effective bactericide and viricide, and some researchers have
observed higher levels of infectious disease in regions with severe particulate
pollution. Could the thick aerosol layers from the massive eruptions during the
end of the Permian have blocked ultraviolet rays so effectively that the
population of pathogens multiplied, thereby contributing to the extinctions of
that era?
<P><I>Forrest M. Mims III <BR>Seguin, Tex.</I>
<P><B>Erwin replies:</B>
<P>In my 1993 book, <I>The Great Paleozoic Crisis: Life and Death in the
Permian</I> (Columbia University Press),<I> </I>I pointed out that based on the
change in carbon isotopes observed in fossil records from the end-Permian, large
quantities of methane may have been released to the atmosphere during that
period. My recent account did not claim that a decline in sea level alone
triggered the extinction but rather argued that multiple causes, possibly
including the Siberian flood basalts, were involved. The mechanism suggested by
Dorritie is possible. Yet because a short pulse of methane would not leave a
unique signal in the geologic record (a change in carbon isotopes could be
produced by a variety of other events), this theory seems a bit difficult to
confirm. The rate of the extinction is simply not yet known, although at least
the final phase of the extinction appears to have been fairly rapid.
<P>Mims's idea is interesting but, again, virtually impossible to test. Both
Dorritie's and Mims's theories depend on the eruption of the Siberian flood
basalts at the Permo-Triassic boundary. Some uncertainty remains about this
correlation, however: much of the eruption may have occurred during the early
Triassic period. In this case, the eruption may have retarded the recovery rather
than caused the extinction.
<P><HR>
<B>NORTHERN EXPOSURE</B>
<P>I read with interest John Horgan's article <A HREF="../0696issue/0696scicit01.html">"'Peaceful' Nuclear Explosions"</A>
[News and Analysis, June]. But I must take issue with his statement that a
nuclear device was detonated in Alaska as part of the Plowshare program to
conduct PNE tests. To the best of my knowledge, a total of three nuclear tests
have been conducted in Alaska, and none could be described as a PNE. But at least
one Plowshare project was proposed for Alaska: Project Chariot was designed to
demonstrate the feasibility of excavating harbors through the use of nuclear
explosives. The site was to be Cape Thompson, southeast of the village of Point
Hope. But after a number of studies--and increasing political awareness and
activity on the part of Alaskan Natives--the test was canceled.

<P><HR><I>Letters may be edited for length and clarity. Because of the
considerable volume of mail received, we cannot answer all correspondence.</I>
<P><HR><B>Clarification</B>
<P>In the article "<A HREF="../0996issue/0996maranto.html">Should Women in Their
40s Have Mammograms?</A>" [Gina Maranto, September], the statement  that "10 to
15 percent of women in any age group who walk away from a mammogram assured that
they are free of cancer go on to acquire it within a year" is inaccurate. The
sentence should read "Among women diagnosed with breast cancer within a year of a
mammogram, 10 to 15 percent had negative mammograms and were assured that they
were tumor free."

<BR><B>NOVEMBER 1946</B>

<P>"In this best-fed nation in the world, one-third to one-half of the population
lacks vitamin C. This vital food element--essential for vigor and efficiency--is
now available in a new mass-produced synthetic form. Technicians have developed
successful manufacturing processes based on combining ascorbic acid and sodium in
water-free methyl alcohol. The new vitamin C is precipitated as a pure, white
crystalline mass."

<P>"Textile making is finding in electronics new methods to produce flawless
fabrics. One application is the 'stop-motion' set-up that detects accidental
thread breaks--which produce flaws and lower market prices--and immediately stops
the looms. Threads entering textile machines pass through a hinged eyelet, called
a drop switch, which is held open by the tension on the thread. When a thread
breaks, the drop switch makes contact with a metal bar and a minute current flow
to an electronic relay stops a machine almost instantly."

<P><HR><B>NOVEMBER 1896</B>

<P>"An immense crowd assembled near the Hotel Metropole, London, November 14, to
witness the departure of the motor carriages for their race to Brighton, 47
miles. The occasion of the race was the going into effect of the new law which
opens the highways to the use of the motor carriages and doing away with the
antiquated laws which have hitherto obtained. It is a curious fact that under the
old law self-propelled vehicles were not allowed to go faster than six miles an
hour and had to be preceded by a horseman waving a red flag. Nearly fifty
carriages started in the race; it is a great satisfaction to know that the race
was won by the American Duryea motor wagon. The distance was covered in four
hours." [<I>Editors' note: The London to Brighton run has 680 antique cars
entered for the centenary event</I>.]

<P>"The removal by blasting and digging of 1,635,000 cubic yards of rock from the
river Danube represents one of the most stupendous and difficult engineering
works of modern times. At last the 'Iron Gates,' which barred this great natural
inland waterway, have been unlocked. There are indications that Roman engineers
studied the problem nigh upon eighteen hundred years ago. The present successful
attempt extended over more than sixty miles of the river's length, and the canal
will now give Vienna an unobstructed outlet to the sea for boats drawing 10 feet
of water."

<P>"More than 2,700 oil wells were bored in Indiana in 1895, and hopeful,
well-informed men expect that enormous total will be surpassed in 1896. It is
predicted that the State will soon rank with Pennsylvania and Ohio in the
quantity of oil annually taken out of the ground. While 2,711 wells were
completed, only 754 went dry in the year just passed."

<P><HR><B>NOVEMBER 1846</B>

<P>"If there is any one crime which should excite universal indignation, it is the
sneaking villainy of cutting the wires of the magnetic telegraph. This
scoundrelism, if not checked by the vigilance of the whole community, appears
likely to deprive the public of the important benefits to be derived from this
greatest invention of the age. It is supposed by some that this mischief proceeds
from sheer envy against the rapidly advancing honor and prosperity of our
country, under a system of free institutions and unbridled enterprise."

<P>"Butter has been supposed to be animal matter, but recent investigations have
proved that butter may be produced from hay or grass, without depending upon the
cow for its preparation. An expert chemist can produce fifteen pounds of
vegetable butter from a hundred weight of hay, being nearly twice as much as can
be produced from the milk of a cow for an equal quantity of hay. We may expect to
see butter factories established in competition with the ordinary dairies."

<P>"A correspondent from Loweville, N.Y., states that on November 11 the most
remarkable meteor ever seen there made its appearance. It appeared larger than
the sun and illumined the hemisphere nearly as light as day. It was in sight
nearly five minutes, and finally fell in a field in the vicinity. A large company
of the citizens immediately repaired to the spot and found a body of foetid
jelly, four feet in diameter."

<P>"Our engraving is a representation of the great Rosse telescope, one of the
principal artificial wonders of the world. It has been recently completed by the
Earl of Rosse at an expense of nearly 60,000 dollars. The tube is 56 feet long.
The speculum is six feet in diameter and weighs nearly four tons; its composition
is 126 parts of copper to 571/2 parts of tin. The telescope rests on a universal
joint and is elevated or depressed by a chain and windlass. The telescope is at
present of the Newtonian construction, and consequently the observer looks into
the side of the tube at the upper end of the telescope."

<P><HR>In 1936 engineer Arthur C. Nielsen, Sr., attended a demonstration at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology of a mechanical device that could keep a
record of the station to which a radio was tuned at any given moment. Nielsen
bought the technology practically on the spot and six years later launched the
Nielsen Radio Index, which analyzed the listening habits of 800 homes. Later, he
adapted the same technology to the new medium of television, creating a ratings
system that nearly all American broadcasters use today to help determine the
popularity of their programs.
<P>Over the years, Nielsen Media Research has used several methods to collect
viewing information, including surveys and volunteer diaries. In 1986 the company
supplanted these with an electronic device called a People Meter. The meter is
now connected to televisions and telephone lines in about 5,000 households
throughout the U.S.
<P>Nielsen households are selected from a sample that is statistically
representative of the television-viewing population. Each household receives
nominal compensation--about $50 and occasional gifts--for their cooperation. In
order to keep the sample representative, viewers can participate for only two
years.
<P>As they watch TV, volunteers press buttons to indicate their presence. The
People Meter records the gender and age of each viewer, as well as the time spent
watching each channel frequency. Every night the device transmits that
household's data by modem to Nielsen's central computer in Florida, which
assembles the data into a ratings database.
<P>To meet the changing needs of broadcasters and sponsors, the technology
continues to evolve. In 1986 Nielsen introduced a system that uses computerized
pattern recognition to identify particular commercials as they are broadcast.
Future versions of the People Meter now under development will monitor codes
embedded into digital TV signals to verify which programs are on the air. They
will also use image-recognition computers to identify viewers the moment they hit
the couch.

<center><H2>THE PRICE OF <BR>SILENCE</H2>

Does profit-minded secrecy <BR>retard scientific progress?</center>

<P>Asked in whom they trust, more Americans in 1994 professed great confidence in
scientists and doctors than in any other professionals, including Supreme Court
Justices and--by nearly five to one--journalists. Researchers owe their prestige
to the image of science as an altruistic and trustworthy enterprise, generating
reliable knowledge for the benefit of all humanity. Recently, however, a number
of prominent scientists have begun voicing an alarm that increasing secrecy among
academic researchers is delaying progress, diverting resources, suppressing good
ideas and, most worrisome, undermining the credibility--and thus usefulness--of
science as a whole. Steven A. Rosenberg,
chief of surgery at the <A HREF="http://www.nci.nih.gov/">National Cancer Institute</A>, argues that in medicine, at least, "it is a very clear moral issue. If
you withhold information, you potentially delay progress. If you delay progress,
you potentially delay the development of effective treatments, and humans beings
suffer and die who need not have done so."

<P>"There has always been secrecy in science, because recognition goes to whoever
publishes first," observes <A HREF="http://ksgwww.harvard.edu/iip/zinberg.html">Dorothy S. Zinberg</A>
of the <A HREF="http://ksgweb.harvard.edu/csia/">Center for Science and International Affairs</A> at Harvard University. "Watson and Crick kept their
discovery of DNA's double helix under tight wraps because they were trying to
beat out Linus Pauling." But the race to publish, she says, is being challenged
by a race to patent.

<P><center><table width=254 border=0 cellpadding=10><tr><td><IMG SRC="IMG/1196infocus.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="254" HEIGHT="255" BORDER="0">

<P><B>RISING INDUSTRIAL FUNDING</B> and academic patenting are changing the
face of basic research.</td></tr></table></center>


<P>As federal funding for academic research has slowed--annual increases
averaging 4.2 percent in the 1980s have dropped to just 0.4 percent last
year--industry has picked up some of the slack. Corporations paid for about 7
percent of university research in 1995, up from 4 percent in 1980. Schools are
also trying to boost their budgets by aggressively patenting their employees'
work: academia's share of the patent pie has doubled since 1991. "Columbia
University now receives about $50 million a year in profits from patents. It
expects that to rise to $100 million within five years," Zinberg says.

<P>But the new money brings new restrictions. Rosenberg reports that when he
recently asked a company for a gene that he needed, the company insisted that he
first sign a contract agreeing not to disclose the substance and "all results and data developed by
[me] resulting from the studies"--for 10 years. He refused and consequently had
to spend more than four months to clone the gene himself.

<P>"At one time, if you found something exciting, you would run down the corridor
and talk about it," reminisces <A
HREF="http://www.jax.org/research/documents/sci94/roopenian.html">Derry Roopenian</A>,
a biologist at the <A HREF="http://www.jax.org/">Jackson Laboratory</A> in Bar Harbor, Me. "Now if you discover something but a commercial
backer is interested in it, you can't say a word about it."

<P>"The greatest effect seems to be on this informal network of scientific
communication," agrees <A HREF="http://www.med.miami.edu/faculty/rubin_robert_w/administration.html">Robert W. Rubin</A>, vice provost for research at the
University of Miami. "But there is an effect on the formal network as well. Most
of our contracts with companies give them 60 to 120 days to evaluate any data
obtained with their backing before we can publish it. That can double or triple
the time it takes to get results into the literature. And sometimes the contracts
state that you cannot publish it at all without their permission. It is not
unheard of for a company to just sit on an idea not because they want to develop
it but because they don't want anyone else to."

<P>In fact, Zinberg notes, "a 1994 study by researchers at Carnegie Mellon
University reported that 53 percent of [scientists surveyed] had agreed to allow
publications to be delayed. And 35 percent had signed agreements whereby the
sponsors could require that information can be deleted from publication." Another
survey that year found that 82 percent of life-sciences companies sometimes
require scientists to keep results confidential for months until patents can be
filed. About half said that academic researchers keep discoveries quiet even
beyond the time needed to obtain a patent.

<P>This hush fell first over medicine and biotechnology, Rubin says. But it is
gradually spreading throughout science. "Suddenly, the language in contracts for
research in other fields sounds like that in biotech contracts," Rubin reports.
Negotiating all these agreements diverts time and energy from science, frets
<A HREF="http://www2.ncsu.edu/ncsu/cals/genetics/sederoff.html">Ronald R. Sederoff</A>, director of the forest biotechnology group at North Carolina
State University. "It has taken us a year and a half to work out an
intellectual-property agreement for [an industry-funded] project to get all the
expressed genes in a pine tree," he says.

<P>Sederoff admits, however, that without industrial backing, the research effort
would not be possible at all. Commercially restricted research may not be ideal,
but isn't it better than doing without? "Biology has finally begun yielding
useful products," counters Barrie J. Carter, research director for <A HREF="http://synapse.bio.com/co/tgc.html">Targeted
Genetics</A> in Seattle. "But unless the federal government wants to develop these
products, we have to rely on capital investors, and they need to protect their
competitive advantages. It is not clear that science is worse for that."

<P>But Zinberg and others worry that industry could be inadvertently undermining
the creativity and independence that make academia worth exploiting in the first
place. "Look at biotechnology," Sederoff argues. "The basic discoveries that led
to the field were based on decades of academic, publicly funded research. I
believe that if these discoveries had been subject to proprietary control and
restriction, we wouldn't have created the field of molecular biology. So there
wouldn't be anything to fight over now."

<P>Two recent incidents suggest that companies' attempts to suppress research can
backfire on them. Boots Pharmaceuticals gave Betty Dong of the University of
California at San Francisco $250,000 to study Synthroid, a synthetic form of
thyroid hormone taken daily by eight million people at an annual cost of some
$600 million. Boots asked Dong to determine whether three generic forms of the
drug were biologically equivalent to Synthroid, presumably expecting the answer
to be no. When Dong discovered that the generics were equivalent and tried last
year to publish her results, Boots invoked a clause in the research contract to
force Dong to withdraw the paper. There the matter might have ended <A HREF="http://www.geom.umn.edu/docs/education/chance/chance_news/full_text/5.05/5.05.6.html">had the
<I>Wall Street Journal</I> not uncovered the episode</A> in April.

<P>Monsanto has also been dogged for years by allegations that it tried to
suppress data on the negative effects of <A HREF="http://www.inform.umd.edu:8080/EdRes/Topic/AgrEnv/Biotech/Education.res/iastate.info/bio3.txt">bovine somatotropin (BST)</A>, its drug to
boost cows' milk production. Scientists funded by <A HREF="http://www.monsanto.com/">Monsanto</A> reported that cows
given the drug suffered only a small increase in udder infections. When
independent British researchers examined the company's data, they found that
previously published reports had, curiously enough, analyzed figures from only
part of the experiment. Pooling all the data together for a more comprehensive
analysis, they concluded that cells associated with udder infections present in
milk increased by about one fifth in cows given BST. But when they attempted to
publish their results in a veterinary journal, Monsanto objected. So in November
1994 the investigators went on a national television news program in Canada. (The
results have yet to be published.)

<P>In part because of uncertainty about the drug's safety, the European Union,
Australia and New Zealand have banned the sale of meat and milk from BST-treated
cows. Analysts say sales have yet to overtake the cost of producing and selling
the drug--never mind the huge investment in its development.

<P>In the long run, Zinberg says, "we are all interested in the vitality of our
universities." Rosenberg suggests that the best way to preserve that is "to talk
about this issue and to find out how prevalent secrecy is and how it is affecting
scientific progress. We need to develop new patent laws and regulations that
allow for the free flow of information and still protect the
intellectual-property rights of those who pay for and conduct research." It
should be possible, he says, to have the best of both worlds.

<BR>of the star Gliese 229 resembles a "hot Jupiter."
</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=336>
<P>Last year, when Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz of the Geneva Observatory
reported the first solid evidence of a <A HREF="http://www.sciam.com/WEB/explorations/052796explorations.html">planet circling a sun-like star</A> outside the
solar system, many astrophysicists were taken aback. These observations showed
what could be a Jupiter-size planet orbiting quite close to the star 51 Pegasi;
it was about seven million kilometers away--only a small fraction of the distance
between the sun and Mercury. Yet existing theories for the development of
planetary systems indicated that such giant planets should form at much greater
distances from a star. What was a big planet doing so close in?
<P>Some initially believed that the old theories were fine and that 51 Pegasi was
simply the exception that proves the rule. After all, the technique that Mayor
and Queloz had used was most sensitive to large planets in tight orbits. But
further discoveries over the past year have uncovered nine other "extrasolar"
planets, and three of these bodies, in addition to the one around 51 Pegasi, are
rapidly circling at a celestial hair's breadth from their stars. Astronomers now
surmise that such "hot Jupiters" might, in fact, be commonplace.
<P>"I don't think any of us were prepared to see these three-day- or
four-day-period Jupiters," says George D. Gatewood, director of the University of
Pittsburgh's Allegheny Observatory, referring to the short times needed for such
planets to complete their diminutive orbits. Indeed, just seven months before the
discovery of the planet around 51 Pegasi, Alan P. Boss, a theoretical
astrophysicist at the Carnegie Institution of Washington, showed that
Jupiter-like planets most likely form at approximately five times the Earth-sun
separation (an often used yardstick called the astronomical unit, or AU, a
distance of about 150 million kilometers), even when the parent star is quite
small.
<P>Recently Douglas N. C. Lin of the University of California at Santa Cruz and
two colleagues offered one way around the conundrum. They argued in the journal
<I>Nature </I>that a Jupiter-like planet would form at about 5 AU and then
gradually spiral inward, along with the disk of dust and debris (called the
planetary nebula) out of which the planet originally formed. This inward
migration is inferred from the basic physics governing the motions of orbiting
material.
<P>Yet the mechanism for halting that orbital decay remains somewhat speculative.
Lin and his co-workers offer two possibilities. In one scenario, the decay
continues until the large planet is brought sufficiently close to raise a tidal
bulge on the central star. If this star rotates faster than the planet orbits,
the tidal bulge would tend to spin ahead of the planet. The massive bulge would
then exert a gravitational pull that helps to speed the planet along in its
orbit, counteracting the ongoing tendency to spiral inward. The second
possibility involves the magnetic field of the star, which could sweep the inner
region of the nebula clear of dust and gas. Once the planet had spiraled to a
position within this open zone, its propensity to lose momentum to nearby parts
of the nebula would wane. Therefore, the tendency for the planet to slow and its
orbit to decay further would be greatly reduced. According to Lin and his
colleagues, "the migration effectively stops near 0.05 AU." Although heated
intensely by the star in this final position, a giant planet would have
sufficiently strong gravity to keep many of the volatile substances that would
otherwise be difficult for a hot planet to hold.
<P>Some astronomers do not accept either of Lin's explanations. "The Lin hypothesis
is nice, but it's a hypothesis," remarks R. Paul Butler of San Francisco State
University, a member of one of the several groups turning up new planets around
distant stars. He points out that rather than being gaseous bodies like Jupiter
(which could have formed only in the outer, cooler parts of the primordial
nebula, where ices and gases abound), they could be "giant nickel-iron bowling
balls." And so like Mercury, they may have originated from the refractory
particles that existed in the hot, inner parts of a planetary nebula. Similarly,
Jack J. Lissauer, a planetary astrophysicist at the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration Ames Research Center, believes that although the theory
makes good sense, the case for inward planetary migration is still not settled.
The origin of these massive bodies critically affects the evolution of these
planetary systems. Boss notes in a recent issue of <I>Physics Today</I> that if
the newly discovered planet around 51 Pegasi indeed migrated from a distant
formation zone to its current position, it "would have ejected or otherwise
destroyed any Earth-like planets it might have encountered." But Lin points out
that other Earth-like planets could have formed in its wake. So perhaps the
prospects for finding far-flung counterparts to our home planet is not
compromised. At this point, with theoreticians struggling to catch up with the
rush of new discoveries, the variety of extrasolar planetary systems remains
anyone's guess. As Butler says, "It's all brand-new and all very
wild."

FIELD NOTES
<center><H2>BRING ME <BR>A SHRUBBERY</H2></center>
I am on an experimental farm near Syracuse in upstate New York, standing next to
dense thickets of a tall woody shrub that is bereft of any edible fruit and would
certainly lose in an arboreal beauty contest. The shrub, a hybrid willow, sends
out a vigorous green spray of whiplike stems that climb as high as 11 feet in a
single year. Although the double rows of identical plants are five feet apart,
the stands are impenetrable: the profusion of wood and leaves is literally
arresting. The willow would seem an unlikely crop, but if Edwin H. White of the
State University of New York's College of Environmental Science and Forestry has
his way, it could become common in much of the northern U.S. By 2010, farmers may
be growing 50,000 acres of the stuff in New York alone.
<P>Shrubbery would not normally warrant an intensive research effort, but to
White and local power companies--and now the Department of Energy--the prodigious
growth rate of these hybrid willows makes them a <A HREF="http://www.esf.edu/pubprog/brochure/willow/willow.htm">potential source of
clean-burning fuel</A>. They produce five to 10 times more wood every year than any
natural forest. A 50,000-acre crop would be worth $20 million.
<P>White, who is dean of research, has spent the past 10 years investigating how
to cultivate the plant. He is convinced that the U.S. and other countries should
make more use of wood for energy. Burning farmed wood in power stations reduces
reliance on foreign oil and curtails emissions of carbon dioxide (although trees
produce the gas when they are burned, they take it out of the atmosphere while
growing).
<P>Hybrid willow shrubs--which look nothing like the familiar tree--appear to be
the most promising biomass fuel for the U.S., White says. Once established they
are extremely hardy, tolerating marginal land with only irrigation and some added
nitrogen. The basic cultivation scheme was developed in Sweden; 50,000 acres are
now grown in Europe. The shoots, which readily grow from sticks, are cut back at
one year, and the wood is harvested every three years thereafter for about 20
years. Researchers are studying a patchwork of varieties.
<P>Burning wood is, of course, hardly a new idea, but its high cost means that
very little is used in the U.S. New York State Electric and Gas Corporation
(NYSEG) is one of a small number of power companies nationwide that have
investigated using waste wood, chipped into two-inch lumps, for burning along
with coal. Michael Tesla of NYSEG says he aims eventually to burn willow in
1/4-inch flakes.
<P>Although willow will cost hardly less than coal for the same amount of energy
when equipment costs are figured in, power companies see it as a valuable way of
cutting about 10 percent from their sulfur emissions, which are limited by
tradable permits, as well as emissions of nitrogen oxides, which may be limited
in the future. The companies also recognize its potential as a hedge against the
possibility that carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels might someday be
taxed.
<P>The federal government is offering willow a jump start. The DOE and the U.S.
Department of Agriculture earlier this year signed an agreement with a consortium
of New York power companies, agencies and academic institutions to establish
2,600 acres of willow as a demonstration project. The energy department will
provide 36 percent of the estimated $14-million cost. Although in New York the
project will initially focus on burning wood directly, in other states it will
eventually include burning gas produced by heating the wood. White notes that
there are 200 million acres of abandoned farmland in the U.S. I don't need to ask
what he would like to see growing on them 20 years from now.

MENTAL HEALTH
<center><H2>MULTICULTURAL STUDIES</H2>
Rates of depression vary widely <BR>throughout the world</center>
<P>Over the past few decades, scientists have drifted toward an increasingly
hard-wired model of the human psyche. A recent article in <I>Newsweek</I>
reflected this trend. Studies of identical twins, the magazine reported, suggest
that happiness stems almost entirely from nature rather than nurture; our mood
depends more on our genes than on our love lives, careers or other circumstances.
<P>But a new international survey indicates that cultural influences may play a
large role in triggering the most common mood disorder, depression. The study, in
which 17 researchers gathered data on 38,000 subjects from 10 countries, found
that rates of major depression in different countries varied by a factor of more
than 10. The results "suggest that cultural differences or different risk factors
may affect the expression of the disorder," the group concludes in the <I><A HREF="http://www.ama-assn.org/public/journals/pubhome.htm">Journal
of the American Medical Association</A>.</I>
<P>The lead author of the study, the largest of its kind ever conducted, is Myrna
M. Weissman, a psychologist at Columbia University. After she supervised a large
survey of depression in the U.S. in the 1980s, researchers in other countries
independently started similar projects. Weissman realized several years ago that
these studies "would be a great opportunity for a cross-national comparison."
Previously, such comparisons have been complicated by the fact that investigators
from different countries employed divergent methodologies.
<P>Weissman eventually teamed up with colleagues from nine other countries. They
employed the diagnostic criteria for depression set forth in the third edition of
the <I>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, </I>or <I>DSM-III;
</I>the major symptoms include loss of energy, insomnia and thoughts of death and
suicide.
<P>The lifetime risk of depression (defined as the probability that a subject
will suffer at least one episode lasting a year or more) ranged from 1.5 percent
in Taiwan to 19 percent in Lebanon. In between, in ascending order, were Korea at
2.9 percent; Puerto Rico, 4.3; the U.S., 5.2, Germany, 9.2; Canada, 9.6; New
Zealand, 11.6; and France, 16.4.
<P>The researchers acknowledged that "some, but not all" of the variation may
stem from reporting artifacts. For example, the reported reluctance of Asians to
acknowledge mental distress as compared with people from western cultures could
account in part for the strikingly low incidence of depression in Taiwan and
Korea. But the team asserts that other factors are also probably responsible.
Taiwan and Korea have very low rates of divorce and separation, which are
associated with high risks of depression in virtually every country.
<P>The high rate of depression in France and New Zealand, conversely, could be
attributed to the higher rate of failed marriages in those populations. Although
divorce and separation are rare in Lebanon, its high rate of depression is not
surprising given that it has been "besieged by war for the past 15 years," the
authors note.
<P>Some patterns held across national borders. In every country, women were
roughly twice as likely as men to suffer from depression. On the other hand,
separated or divorced men were in general more likely to become depressed than
women in the same condition; these results correlate with previous U.S. studies.
The average age at which depression first occurred fell within a relatively
narrow range, from 24 years in Canada to 34 in Italy.
<P>The researchers gathered data not only on depression but also on bipolar
disorder, or manic-depression, in which depression alternates with states of
extreme mental agitation and even psychosis. The rates of manic-depression showed
much less cross-national variation than those of depression, ranging from 0.3
percent of the population in Taiwan to 1.5 percent in New Zealand. These data are
consistent with previous research showing that manic-depression has a stronger
genetic component than simple depression.

<P><B>OSCILLONS</B>
<BR>do not yet explain consciousness but are spurring the search for a theory of granular media.</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=336>
<P>The <A HREF="http://www.aip.org/physnews/graphics/condensed/1996/oscillon/">oscillon</A> is rather a modest beast, a pile of tiny brass balls that jiggles
up and down and joins with other piles to form patterns. Still, its discovery has
caused quite a stir. In a breathless tour of buzzwords, the <I>New York Times</I>
recently linked oscillons with the origin of life, self-organized criticality,
fractals, human individuality and complexity. Who knows, the amazing oscillon may
yet help finance a 15 percent tax cut.
<P>But even stripped of such ambitions, the oscillon remains a curious creature.
The object appeared when <A HREF="http://chaos.ph.utexas.edu/%7Epbu/">Paul B. Umbanhowar</A> of the University of Texas at Austin
and his colleagues vibrated a tray of brass balls up and down. The balls, each
less than 0.1 millimeter in radius, together resemble sand. As anyone who has
tried running on a beach can testify, motion in such a medium damps out very
fast. In the physicists' experiment, the vibration, at between 10 to 100 cycles
per second, feeds energy constantly to the balls, allowing ripples and other
features to form at the surface.
<P>Different patterns form as the vibration is varied. When the powder is shaken
at about two-and-a-half times the acceleration due to gravity, square and stripe
patterns appear on the surface, pulsing up and down like standing waves in a
fluid. The oscillons--isolated peaks or valleys--form at lower frequencies.
Sometimes, Umbanhowar says, one can start an oscillon by touching the "sand"
surface with a pencil. The initial depression pushes up into a peak and then
collapses back into a valley. It alternates between hill and crater at half the
frequency at which the tray is being driven. The oscillon drifts around slowly
and lives indefinitely.
<P>If two or more oscillons vibrate in phase--that is, become hills at the same
time--they repel. Three such oscillons can arrange themselves into triads. But if
two oscillons vibrate out of phase, so that one reaches its peak when the other
is a crater, they attract. If they come within 1.4 diameters of each other, these
out-of-phase oscillons pull together into a bound pair or join with other such
pairs into chains or square lattices. The entire pattern pulsates in a way
characteristic of forced oscillations.
<P>Although this behavior may have inspired unwarranted hype, the oscillons are
still intriguing because they look a lot like--and are yet unlike--excitations in
other media. A tray of viscous fluid vibrated up and down acquires a variety of
surface patterns, including peaks and craters. But these excitations are not as
isolated as those observed in the brass-ball tray. Moreover, there is no theory
to describe the dynamics of a bronze granular substance. Analogies with fluids
are tempting but fall apart under closer scrutiny. For example, a fluid has a
temperature--a measure of the amount of random motion of its particles. But
because the grains in a sandlike medium just sit around, their temperature is
effectively zero. Vibrating the tray imparts motion to the grains, but a highly
ordered one that cannot be directly translated into temperature.
<P>In short, the discovery is spurring theorists in their search for an equation
of motion for sand and keeping experimenters busy documenting oscillon antics.
What more could a physicist ask for?

SOCIOLOGY
<center><H2>DIFFERENT STROKES</H2>
A book intimates why we gossip</center>
<P>Evolutionary psychologists believe they can explain why the ratings for
<I>Oprah </I>consistently best coverage of a congressional hearing on welfare
reform legislation or a documentary on the lemurs of Madagascar. It all relates
to why we no longer spend much of our waking time poking, scratching and stroking
one another--the type of grooming behavior characteristic of chimpanzees, baboons
and other primates.
<P>The evolutionary case for <I>Oprah</I>-like gossip as a substitute for a good
fondle has been laid out in a new book, <I>Grooming, Gossip and the Evolution of
Language, </I>published earlier this year in Britain and scheduled for release in
the U.S. next spring by <A HREF="http://www.hup.harvard.edu/">Harvard University Press</A>.
<P>The author, <A HREF="http://www.apa.org/releases/social.html">Robin Dunbar</A>, a professor of psychology at the University of
Liverpool, and other academics have ruffled a few well-groomed feathers in the
staid linguistics community. Their gossip-grooming hypothesis asserts that our
big brains and a unique ability to communicate through language did not evolve as
a means to plan for the daily exigencies of food gathering, as suggested by some
earlier theories. Instead language--and in particular gossip--emerged to furnish
the social glue needed to bind large groups. It thus substitutes for grooming:
the probing of fur for dead skin, matted hair or dead leaves. (Even today the
word "stroking" has become slang for currying favor--a means of grooming with
words.)
<P>Dunbar made his own contribution to this growing body of work by finding a
correlation between the dimensions of the neocortex--the part of the brain
engaged in conscious thought--and the size of different groupings of mammals. (A
group in this context is defined as animals that eat, mate and travel together.)
The neocortex may have expanded to track the complex web of social relationships
that emerged as clans grew, perhaps to accommodate increasingly nomadic ways of
life.
<P>In humans, Dunbar found, the size of the neocortex predicts groupings of about
150 people. This number happens to conform to the approximate membership of the
clan within hunter-gatherer societies; the company unit within the military; and
the aggregate of employees within a business that can be managed without an
elaborate bureaucracy. The figure of 150, Dunbar writes, represents the maximum
number of individuals with whom "we can have a genuinely social relationship, the
kind of relationship that goes with knowing who they are and how they relate to
us."
<P>As groups start to swell into the many dozens, the idle practice of grooming
suffers. To pick burrs from enough friends' hair to maintain social cohesiveness,
a hominid would have had to spend about 40 percent of its time in making nice to
others, an investment of energy that would have been diverted from essentials of
survival such as foraging and hunting. Language became the means to provide the
social cement that had once been furnished through the act of grooming.
Consequently, most talk involves shooting the breeze. Gossip, however, is more
than mere idle chatter. "It's saying that I'd rather be here with you than over
there with Joe Blow," Dunbar quips. Research at British universities, he notes,
has shown that even nominally serious academics spend about two thirds of their
conversation time chitchatting.
<P>Many linguists have yet to embrace these arguments fully, but Dunbar remains
undaunted. He contends that the work combines a novel set of insights from
academic disciplines ranging from animal behavior to evolutionary biology. These
ideas, he is convinced, will supply a deeper understanding of the roots of
language, the reason for our swollen brains as well as a rationale for the
continued popularity of the banal programming on daytime television.

ANTI GRAVITY
<center><H2>ON PRESIDENTS AND KING</H2></center>
If familiarity does indeed breed contempt, there are two things you are no doubt
sick of by now: the hoarse windiness of Bill Clinton and the grievous monotone of
Bob Dole. One of those voices, however, will be our choice to deliver the next
batch of State of the Union addresses. According to <A HREF="http://www.apa.org/releases/social.html">research recently published
in the <I>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</I></A>, a particular vocal quality,
revealing who has the higher social status, may be instrumental in guiding that
choice.
<P>Stanford W. Gregory, Jr., a sociology professor at Kent State University, and
his colleague Stephen Webster have long studied the nonverbal aspects of speech
involving the communication that goes on outside of mere words. Research in this
field has shown that when people talk to one another, their speech
characteristics tend to converge--pitch patterns, pause lengths, pronunciations.
<P>In 1992 Gregory acquired an instrument called a fast Fourier transform (FFT)
analyzer, which can break down complex sounds and represent them in the form of a
spectrum. As a first step in using the instrument to look at vocal patterns, he
wanted merely to generate a few spectra. "I thought that good test material would
be interviews," Gregory recalls, "and I didn't want to do a bunch of them myself
for test purposes, so I thought, well, what about Larry King? He's a pretty good
interviewer--there's a lot of data there, it's a clear signal."
<P>Gregory set the FFT analyzer to work on tapes of 25 King interviews and
produced band spectra of the low-frequency part of the human voice. That region,
below 500 cycles per second, is a key nonverbal area of convergence. "I found
just by looking through the stats that some of the interviews tended to cluster
together," he says. These clustered voices belonged to major movers and shakers,
such as then President George Bush and then candidate Clinton, and
mega-celebrities Barbra Streisand and Elizabeth Taylor. (Although women's voices
are usually higher in pitch than men's, they still have a full presence in this
low-frequency band.)
<P>Intrigued by the clustering, Gregory examined the data more closely. A
complete statistical workup of the low-frequency spectra agreed with Gregory's
eyeball interpretation and revealed that other celebrities' vocal qualities
differed widely from the biggest of shots. Jimmy Carter, for example, finished in
a virtual tie with Julie Andrews, von Trapped in the middle of the celebrity
pack. Meanwhile Garrison Keillor's and Spike Lee's voices placed near the bottom
of the list, perhaps revealing that Lake Wobegon is Crooklyn without the
courtside seats at a New York Knicks game.
<P>Analysis of King's voice, the common element in all the interviews, showed
that he adjusted his low-frequency band to have it converge with those of the
Barbras and the Bushes, thus accommodating these highest-status guests. Keillor
and Lee, in contrast, modulated their voices to accommodate Larry's.
<P>Gregory also conducted a survey in which students were asked to assign
celebrity status to the subjects of the King interviews. The students' ranking
agreed nicely with the relative positions of the vocal spectra and tendency to
accommodate, showing that the low-frequency vocal band may indeed be a marker for
social status.
<P>This kind of vocal analysis, comparing status and deference, should be of
great interest to politicians and their handlers. Assume, for example, that
low-frequency vocal analysis showed Clinton dominating Dan Rather, but Dole
deferring to the anchorman. The Dole team might veto Rather from any panel asking
questions at a debate between those two, aware that the audience could pick up on
the candidates' relative status as brokered by the questioner. (Not to mention
that "What's the frequency, Kenneth?" would take on a new significance.)
<P>Perhaps all this explains the early withdrawal from the current presidential
race of the possessor of the voice responsible for once saying, "If we do not
succeed, then we run the risk of failure." Dan Quayle finished dead last on the
King guest list, differing from the top vocal spectra by the widest margin and
accommodating Larry's voice more than any other interviewee in the study. Quayle
also once said, "The American public will judge me on what I am saying," unaware
that the judgment may lie as much in how he was saying it.

IN BRIEF
<P><B>Making Voting a Science</B>
<P>Both leading presidential candidates have paid scant attention to science
during the campaign, despite agreement that research stimulates growth. Bob
Dole's pledge to lower taxes by 15 percent would demand large cuts in civilian
research and development; Representative George Brown, a Democrat from
California, projects reductions as large as 40 percent by 2002, with cuts falling
especially hard on the Departments of Energy and Commerce. Nor does President
Bill Clinton's balanced budget plan look auspicious: the American Association for
the Advancement of Science says it implies a 19 percent drop in nondefense R&AMP;D
over the same period. Congressional staff say total R&AMP;D as a proportion of
gross domestic product is likely to fall from 2.4 to about 2.1 percent.
<P><HR><B>Sickle Cell Successes</B>
<P>This past summer it became clear that bone marrow transplants could probably
cure some children suffering from sickle cell anemia, a genetic condition in
which abnormally shaped red blood cells clog capillaries and cause
life-threatening tissue damage. Recently hope has come to many more. In September
researchers at <A HREF="http://www.tju.edu/">Thomas Jefferson University</A> reported on a new synthetic
molecule--called a chimeraplast--that in laboratory tests can actually repair the
responsible genetic malfunction. Clinical tests should begin soon.
<P><HR><B>Affirmative Reaction</B>
<P>What's good for the goose is good for the gander. In 1990 researchers at the
Johns Hopkins School of Medicine initiated a series of changes--among them
correcting salary inequities--to minimize sexual bias at the school. <A HREF="http://infonet.welch.jhu.edu/news/news_releases/fried.jh.html">This year's
follow-up</A> found that while the changes made academic medicine an easier career
choice for women, they also gave many more gifted men a chance at success. Those
planning to leave the field fell by 63 percent among women and by 42 percent
among men.
<P><HR><B>Treating the Common Cold</B>
<P>Physicians at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation in Ohio <A HREF="http://www.acponline.org./journals/annals/15jul96/zincgluc.htm">recently found</A> that
patients taking zinc gluconate-laced lozenges suffered most cold symptoms for
half as many days as did untreated individuals. Why the metal-containing medicine
works is as yet unclear. But in vitro zinc can, among other flu-fighting
activities, impair viral replication.
<P><HR><B>Jurassic Jawbreakers</B>
<P>Tyrannosaurus rex was no slack-jaw--judging by the teeth marks in a
70-million-year-old triceratops fossil. Researchers from the University of
California at Berkeley and Stanford University poured putty into a punctured
dinosaur pelvis and cast a set of T. rex dentures. Next they measured how much
pressure it took to sink the serrated falsies into cow hipbones. <A HREF="http://pio06.urel.berkeley.edu/documentation/triceratops.html">The results</A>
showed that T. rex could clamp down with a force of some 3,000 pounds. The only
modern-day predator with a similar bite is an alligator.
<P><HR><B>Nitrates and Lymphoma</B>
<P>Since 1973 the incidence of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma has risen some 75 percent
in the U.S., in large part because of the AIDS epidemic. Recent findings by the
<A HREF="http://www.nci.nih.gov/">National Cancer Institute</A> and others, though, have uncovered another explanation.
Among people in rural Nebraska, those consuming the largest amounts of nitrates
in their drinking water face the greatest risk of disease. How these chemicals,
commonly used in fertilizers and pesticides, cause cancer in people is not
understood. But nitrates can combine with amino acids in water to form known
carcinogens.
<P><HR><B>Tracing True 3-D Images</B>
<P>Don't throw away those red-and-green movie glasses just yet, but scientists
can now cast <A HREF="http://www.aip.org/physnews/graphics/atoms/1996/3d/">true three-dimensional pictures</A> in a crystal cube using infrared
lasers. Where the invisible beams intersect, rare-earth elements embedded in the
cube fluoresce in red, blue or green. In this way, the beams trace outlines in
space, just as electron beams trace flat scenes on television screens. The catch?
Rendering realistic 3-D images may require far more data than any computer could
ever supply in real time.
<P><HR><B>In the Swim</B>
<P>New York City is a colder--and cleaner--place for the Arctic animals at the
<A HREF="http://www.wcs.org/">Wildlife Center in Central Park</A> these days. The zoo is currently testing a new
electricity-based water-treatment system, which relies on ozone to eliminate
bacteria, viruses and odors from their aquatic displays. An added benefit is that
the polar bears can now hunt for food as they would in the wild. Using ozone
enables zoo officials to fill the exhibits with live fish, which cannot tolerate
chlorine-treated tanks.
<P><HR>FOLLOW-UP
<P><B>Killing Fields</B>
<P>In flagrant violation of national law--and, most likely, the international
treaty banning ivory trade as well--poachers slaughtered more than 200 elephants
in the forests of the Congo this past summer. Wildlife Conservation Society
researcher Michael Fay first spotted the accumulating bodies, many of them
pregnant females and juveniles, while making routine flights over a remote
watering hole 500 miles north of Brazzaville. When a television news crew went in
by helicopter in September, the extent of the carnage became clear. Congolese
officials had only recently put the area under the protection of the nation's
largest game park. (See December 1994, page 94.)
<P><HR><B>Making Taxol in Bulk</B>
<P>Japanese scientists have described a <A HREF="http://biotech.nature.com/1996-September/solvingthequottaxoldilemmaquot">new way to make taxol</A>, the anticancer
drug now in high demand for treating breast and ovarian cancers. The compound,
first isolated in piddling amounts from the Pacific yew tree, is notoriously
difficult to make in large batches. The highest yields are currently had from
cell cultures of taxol-producing plants, such as Taxus media. The Japanese group
used this same basic approach but greatly increased their culture's yield by
adding a strong promoting substance, called methyl jasmonate. The workers hope
the tactic will help more taxol reach the market at lower prices. (See June 1996,
page 94.)

MATERIALS SCIENCE
<center><H2>PRESSURE TO CHANGE</H2>
Supercritical carbon dioxide <BR>to toughen common materials</center>
<P>About 2,000 years ago construction workers used the latest high-tech materials
to pour an enormous concrete dome for a new temple in Rome. Millennia later the
Pantheon's roof is still intact--in fact, it is hardening as calcium compounds in
the structure gradually react with carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to form
limestone and other minerals that are even stronger than concrete. In May a
construction engineer from Reno, Nev., patented an inexpensive way to shorten
that hardening process from several thousand years to just a few minutes.
Preliminary studies suggest the innovation could yield products ranging from less
expensive wallboard to safer radioactive waste disposal.
<P>Concrete normally hardens so slowly because water seals its pores against
carbon dioxide in the air. "But an article in <I>Scientific American</I> on the
use of [high-pressure] CO<sub>2</sub> for making cheaper plastics got me thinking," recalls
Roger H. Jones, an engineer with <A HREF="http://www.mtlstech.com/site.htm">Materials
Technology Limited</A>. "I took my
pressure cooker, wrapped it in wire and tried an experiment." Jones discovered
that exposing concrete mixed with portland cement to high-pressure CO<sub>2</sub> drove
water out of the material and changed its chemical composition. Standard
compression tests, he says, show that on average the treatment increases the
strength of portland cement by 84 percent. Subsequent experiments at Los Alamos
National Laboratory have demonstrated that the process can transform a wide range
of inexpensive materials--including some that are currently considered waste
products--into stronger, more useful forms.
<P>The process is so simple, says F. Carl Knopf, a professor of chemical
engineering at Louisiana State University, that it is surprising no one hit on it
before. Raised to about 75 times normal atmospheric pressure and to at least 31
degrees Celsius, carbon dioxide becomes as dense as a liquid yet remains
compressible like a gas. In this so-called supercritical state, observes Craig M.
V. Taylor of the <A HREF="http://mwanal.lanl.gov/CST/CST-18/superfluids.html">supercritical fluids facility</A> at Los Alamos, the CO<sub>2 </sub>has no
surface tension and so can permeate the pores and cracks in a substance without
resistance. Reactions that typically take aeons run their course in a matter of
minutes. "There is no question that this makes cements harder," Knopf says.
<P>Ultratough cement has plenty of practical applications. Taylor suggests, for
instance, that the process could prevent dangerous leaching from nuclear waste
that has been mixed with conventional cement for storage. Yet finding wider uses
for the supercritical cement process won't be easy, predicts Thomas J. Pasko,
director of the office of advanced research at the Federal Highway
Administration. "Our construction industry is very traditional and
brute-force-oriented," he points out. "We very seldom look for new materials to
solve problems. So you have to come up with something that is the same cost or
cheaper than existing products."
<P>Jones and Taylor have a plan to do just that. They are treating concrete
roofing tiles for Boral in Rialto, Calif. Concrete tiles are more durable and
fire-resistant than most shingles, but in order to meet strength requirements
they must be so heavy that they overwhelm most houses' frames. Tiles treated with
CO<sub>2</sub> rather than fired in ovens appear to be light enough to compete with
shingles.
<P>In addition to hardening conventional cement, Jones wants to make building
materials from the fly ash produced by coal-fired power plants. Mixed with sodium
silicate, calcium oxide and water, the ash forms a paste that dries into a weak,
water-soluble board. "But when we react this stuff with supercritical CO<sub>2</sub>,"
Taylor says, "it comes out very strong, very stable and completely insoluble in
water. A 12-inch test span can support 650 pounds, comparable to
fiberglass-reinforced cement," which is commonly used in flooring.

<P>"The vision here," Taylor continues, "is to build a processing facility next
to a power plant. The power company is already producing lots of CO<sub>2</sub>and fly ash.
They will pay you to take the ash, since they have to landfill it otherwise. You
also get cheap electricity to run your facility. And you can use the plant's
exhaust heat for free." Moreover, Jones adds, "we can distribute finished
products on empty coal cars as they leave the plant." Jones has hired a firm to
scale up his process using high-pressure equipment such as that used to
decaffeinate coffee and to remove fats from foods. He says he has already begun
negotiating with a power company and a wallboard manufacturer.
<P>"This opens up an entirely new area of materials science," Taylor claims. In
recent experiments, he and Jones have shown that by dissolving metals or plastics
into the supercritical fluid, they can impregnate cements with other compounds to
make them more flexible, durable or electrically conductive. "The best part of
this process," Taylor notes, "is that it permanently removes a greenhouse gas
from the atmosphere and waste products like fly ash from landfills and transforms
them into materials to build homes out of. If you really want to push industry
into helping out the environment, you have to make it profitable. This helps do
that."

<FONT SIZE="-1"><B>STANDARD <BR>DOCUMENT COVER</B>
<BR>conceals government information.</TD></FONT>
<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=336>
<P>Within the U.S. government's massive stockpile of classified documents are the
usual necessities of national security, such as blueprints for developing
high-tech weaponry. They will, of course, remain under lock and key for many
years to come. But the archives also contain taxpayer-funded research that no
longer needs to be guarded and in many cases should have been released long ago.
Such technical know-how, if made available, could give the American economy a
boost without compromising the country's defense, argue business leaders,
scientists and other advocates of less secrecy.
<P>One such advocate is Michael Ravnitzky, technical director of the Industrial
Fabrics Association International in St. Paul, Minn. He has been trying to pry
information out of the <A HREF="http://www.dtic.dla.mil/">Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC)</A> in Alexandria,
Va., for the past nine years. "Decades of work done by the Defense Department and
its contractors in the area of safety and protective fabrics would be of enormous
use to our industry," Ravnitzky says. The data could aid the development of
protective clothing, helping companies make more fire-resistant tents, sleeping
bags and children's clothing.
<P>Even defense contractors who build supersecret weapons systems urge more
openness. Jack S. Gordon is the president of Lockheed Martin's famous Skunk
Works, which developed the U-2 spy plane and F-117 stealth fighter. Last year he
told a government commission that a "culture of secrecy" often leads the military
to classify too much and declassify too little. "The consequence of this action
directly relates to added cost, affecting the bottom line of industry and
inflating procurement costs to the government," he wrote.
<P>Ravnitzky is in a better spot than most. He knows what he wants--he just can't
get to it. Others are convinced there are numerous areas in which classified
government research could help the private sector, but they aren't sure what or
where it is.
<P>"We don't know what we don't know, so it's hard to be too definitive about
what buried treasures might be in the various archives," says Steven Aftergood,
director of the Federation of American Scientists's <A HREF="http://www.fas.org/sgp/index.html">Project on Government
Secrecy</A>. "On the other hand, the government has spent many millions of dollars on
classified research and development over the past few decades, and you would
think there would be one or two things in there that would be useful, that would
have commercial value."
<P>Steven Garfinkel, director of the government's Information Security Oversight
Office, agrees. Yet he doesn't know what valuable secrets might be hidden in
government archives, and if he doesn't know, no one can. "It may be a mother
lode," Garfinkel says. "We don't know for sure."
<P>The government is well aware of the potential payoff in declassification and
less secrecy. In 1970 the Pentagon produced a study showing that "the U.S. lead
in microwave electronics and in computer technology was uniformly and greatly
raised after the decision in 1946 to release the results of wartime research in
these fields." The same study said nuclear reactor and transistor technology
development also benefited from an open research policy.
<P>Kurt Molholm, administrator of the DTIC, states that it is Defense Department
policy to "make available to the general public as much scientific and technical
information as possible," but Ravnitzky and others believe the government, and
especially the Pentagon, actually releases as little as possible.
<P>They are not supposed to be holding back. Under the terms of an executive
order signed in April 1995 by President Bill Clinton, government agencies must,
by this past October, have declassified 15 percent of documents older than 25
years, with some exceptions. Many agencies will not make it, and some won't even
come close. The executive order was intended to make bulk
declassification--removing the secrecy tag from massive bundles of related
documents without inspecting every single page--the norm. Although some agencies
have made progress, others are well behind. The U.S. Navy, for example, says it
will need to have $1 per page to declassify 500 million documents--a price no one
is willing to pay. Of course, information that should stay secret can be
protected under the executive order's "state-of-the-art" technology exemption to
the bulk declassification rule. But that introduces another concern. "The issue
is, what does state-of-the-art technology mean?" Garfinkel asks. "We're going to
have to establish some rules rather quickly."
<P>There are some signs that the government is trying, at least. Garfinkel notes
that in 1995, for the first time in many years, declassification outpaced
classification. Still, critics want the government to start releasing large
numbers of older documents immediately, while reforming the current system to
ensure that the secret stockpile does not continue to grow.
<P>"The truth is that most government documentation is worthless within minutes
of its production and certainly after the passage of time," Aftergood argues.
"The problem is that I don't want the government deciding what I as a citizen
should be interested in and what I should not be interested in."

<center><H2>PUMP IT UP</H2>

A new implant <BR>sustains heart patients <BR>waiting for transplants</center>

<P>If not for a device that pumped blood from his left ventricle into his aorta,
Robert Berkey would not have lived to celebrate his 20th birthday. During his
final exams at Clarkson University in upstate New York last year, Berkey
collapsed, unable to move. A chest x-ray revealed that his heart, engorged with
blood, had blown up to the size of a volleyball. Doctors placed Berkey on a
heart-transplant waiting list, but to keep him alive in the interim, surgeons at
Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New York City implanted an LVAD, or left
ventricular assist device.

<P>This pump, produced by <A HREF="http://www.thermo.com/subsid/tca.html">Thermo Cardiosystems</A> in Woburn, Mass., is the fruit of
research that began in the 1960s. The technology is just now beginning to realize
its potential to keep defective hearts pumping--sometimes for as long as 17
months--until a donor becomes available. Approximately 800 of the 3,500 people on
the list for transplants die every year, according to the United Network for
Organ Sharing; thousands more who need the organs are not even placed on the
overburdened list.

<P>Last year the Food and Drug Administration approved another use for LVADs:
transplant alternatives. "Ever since we started this project, our goal has been
to use these devices not only as a bridge to transplant but also as a long-term
treatment of end-stage heart disease," explains Eric A. Rose of
Columbia-Presbyterian. According to the National Institutes of Health, as many as
35,000 people in the U.S. could benefit from the combined uses for LVADs.

<P>Of the two biotechnology companies working on these implantable devices,
Cardiosystems's is the only one that has FDA approval. The company's LVADs come
in two forms. Both consist of a titanium pump with three protruding valves: one
is connected to the left ventricle, one to the aorta, and one to an external
power source. The older version, which has been implanted in more than 600
people, is powered with compressed air generated by a console about the size of a
stereo receiver. This version requires that patients stay in the hospital. The
newer device--which Berkey received as part of a clinical trial and which has
been implanted in 124 people so far--is driven by a beeper-size battery.

<P>Despite their promise, LVADs have drawbacks. They can lead to infections
around the heart and stomach (where they are often placed) in 10 percent of
recipients as well as to blood clots. Further, they are costly. The entire
procedure can run up to $200,000--including $50,000 for the device. Medicare has
agreed to pay for implants of the air-driven Cardiosystems LVAD, and a number of
private insurers--including Blue Cross/Blue Shield and Aetna Life and
Casualty--have agreed to reimburse patients either partially or completely.
Berkey's medical costs amounted to more than $250,000 after he received his donor
heart this past spring. His father's insurance company footed part of the bill.
The rest came from his neighbors in Chittenango, N.Y.

CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
<center><H2>MOLECULAR MOLDS</H2>
Plastic replicas <BR>mimic complex molecules</center>
<P>While some biochemists have struggled to synthesize complex macromolecules to
mimic natural compounds, others have been taking a simpler road--to cast <A HREF="http://ci.mond.org/9606/960615.html">the
desired molecule in plastic</A>. Many polymers consist of molecular building blocks
that are small enough to be linked together to approximate the crannies and
bulges of a drug, enzyme, antibody or other biologically active structure.
<P>For the better part of 20 years, researchers have been attempting to realize
this elegant approach, which suffers from a number of difficulties: the molecule
from which the cast is being taken must be removed safely from the polymer after
the process is finished, and it also must not be distorted unduly while the cast
is being made. But in the past two years investigators have begun to meet with
success. This summer Klaus Mosbach of the University of Lund cast holes in the
shape of corticosteroids (anti-inflammatory drugs that typically contain several
dozen atoms) and discovered that the resulting plastic could bind the steroids
from a solution containing a mixture of similar compounds. Mosbach also imprinted
polymers to recognize diazepam (the active ingredient in Valium). Because the
plastic's properties change when its cavities are filled, it can serve as a
highly specific biosensor.
<P>The technique that appears to work best involves monomers (the polymer
building blocks) that incorporate an extra chemical group capable of reacting,
albeit weakly, with the template molecule. These reactions stabilize the monomers
in place around the template while the polymer is solidifying. Once
polymerization is complete, researchers can add solvents, bases or acids to undo
the binding and remove the template.
<P>Using a similar technique, Kenneth J. Shea of the University of California at
Irvine says his group has developed molecularly imprinted membranes that can even
distinguish between versions of a single compound that differ only in their
symmetry, or chirality. "Left-handed" versions of a drug can be made to pass
through the membrane much more easily than "right-handed" ones, or vice versa.
This selectivity could be extremely important for pharmaceutical companies
because chirality often determines a drug's activity. (Perhaps the most famous
case is thalidomide, whose right-handed version has shown great promise as a
nontoxic anticancer agent, but whose left-handed version caused the deformation
of thousands of children born to women who took the drug in the 1950s and 1960s.)
<P>Imprinted polymers could also act as catalysts by holding organic molecules in
particular configurations where they can react more easily, Shea notes. Because
they are made of relatively durable plastics rather than amino acids, such
"artificial enzymes" could find use in industrial processes by which their
natural counterparts would quickly be destroyed by heat or corrosive conditions.
If the casting process fulfills its promise, the synthesis of new molecules may
rely on nanoscopic molding techniques rather than on the theoretical modeling
that currently consumes so many hours of computer time around the globe.

Kurt Vonnegut's Cat's Cradle depicts a world in which a substance called ice-nine
causes water molecules to freeze solid. As a consequence, any living organism
that touches it turns into a statue of ice. When Hollywood decides to make the
movie version of the book, the cinematographer might want to contact Dayton
Taylor. The New York City-based production manager for independent filmmakers has
devised a special-effects technique able to produce frozen images eerily similar
to the ones concocted from Vonnegut's imagination.
<P>For his system, Taylor cobbled together in his kitchen an array of 60
interconnected cameras(below). All the cameras share a common film magazine: each
one contains an unexposed frame of the same strip of motion-picture film. To take
a picture, the camera shutters all open at the same time. The film registers 60
separate photographs of the same image; only the viewing angle varies slightly
(1.5 inches separates the center point of each lens). The photographer then turns
a hand crank that winds the 10 feet of film until each camera is again fitted
with unexposed film.
<P>The 60 still shots can be shown in sequence as a strange three-dimensional
movie in which people resemble the models encountered at Madame Tussaud's Wax
Museum (photo sequence at right). One of Taylor's images reveals the right side
of a youth jumping in midair, then slowly moves to show his left side. A similar
right-left perspective highlights drops of champagne spurting from a bottle.
<P>What can you do with 10 feet of cameras? "I'm wracking my brain trying to
think about applications for this art form/technology," wrote Steven Spielberg to
an acquaintance after witnessing a videotape of Taylor's invention. Taylor
believes the main use will be for special effects in films--and, in fact, a
French production company used a similar technique in crafting a music video for
the Rolling Stones. Apple Computer's QuickTime VR also allows a computer user to
navigate through photographic scenes in a similar three-dimensional way.

<IMG SRC="IMG/1196techbus5.gif" WIDTH="175" HEIGHT="259" BORDER="0">
<br clear=all><FONT SIZE="-1">Credit: Dayton Taylor</FONT></td></tr></table>Taylor's camera array, for which a patent is pending, is limited because it
records only an instant or two of activity before the film must be wound forward.
As the cost of digital photography and the size of cameras diminish, this
limitation may disappear. A camera array, perhaps containing thousands of tiny
units, could record a three-dimensional perspective of an event as it progresses
over time, thus providing a novel form of interactive video. Engineers could
build camera arrays into the cylindrical wall of a space shuttle, enabling
students around the U.S. to move about the interior of the spacecraft by
manipulating a joystick. A television viewer might choose to watch the finish of
the 100-meter dash from in front of or behind the runners during the Olympics in
Sydney in the year 2000. The promise of such an interactive system may allow
designers to drop the adjective from "virtual reality."

<CENTER><H2>THEREZA IMANISHI-KARI</H2>
<B>Starting with a Clean Slate</B></center>
<P>For someone whose lack of organization has become a topic of conversation
throughout academe and beyond, Thereza Imanishi-Kari has a strikingly tidy
office. The Brazilian-born scientist was this past summer cleared of all charges
of scientific misconduct arising from a tangled, decade-old controversy that
reached into the halls of Congress and forced Nobelist David Baltimore, one of
Imanishi-Kari's co-authors in a disputed scientific study, to resign as president
of the Rockefeller University. Because of his indignant defense of Imanishi-Kari,
the case became known as the "Baltimore affair," even though she was the only one
of six collaborators to be accused of wrongdoing. Intense news coverage turned
the saga into the most sensational case of alleged research fraud in U.S.
history: three books about it are now in progress. Recently reinstated as an
assistant professor in the pathology department at the Tufts University School of
Medicine, Imanishi-Kari, currently in her early fifties, seems remarkably
unbitter. Casually dressed and in an ebullient mood in her small room at the top
of a cramped laboratory building in the New England Medical Center, she displays
no anger toward her accusers, concluding that they should look to their
consciences: "We all have to live with our mistakes." She finds it "very sad,"
however, that some scientists, notably Mark Ptashne of Harvard University,
publicly sided with her accusers without ever discussing the evidence with her.
<P>Moreover, press coverage of the controversy, Imanishi-Kari says, was
"irresponsible"; she singles out the <I>New York Times</I> for handing out blame
in 1991 on the basis of a condemnatory draft report by the Office of Research
Integrity (then the Office of Scientific Integrity) of the Department of Health
and Human Services. That leaked document became public before she knew the
details of the allegations against her and before her lawyers had cross-examined
witnesses. At that time, she says, she doubts "whether the scientists who were
overseeing the investigation at the Office of Scientific Integrity actually had
seen the evidence." She expresses agitation only in decrying the lack of due
process that made that situation possible.
<P>The research at the heart of the dispute, published in the journal <I>Cell</I>
in 1986, concerned antibodies produced by genetically engineered mice.
Imanishi-Kari, then at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and her
co-authors reported that the addition of a gene to the mice made them produce a
range of antibodies that was altered in a surprising way. The arguments started
within a month, when Margot O'Toole, a researcher whom Imanishi-Kari had hired to
extend the experiments, came to suspect that Imanishi-Kari's own studies did not
support the published account. Early inquiries by scientists at the involved
universities and by the National Institutes of Health found errors in the
paper--it overstated the power of a key reagent, for example--but the errors did
not threaten the paper's main conclusions, and the investigators found no
evidence of misconduct. But in 1989 O'Toole upped the ante by charging that data
reported in a published correction to the paper had been fabricated, and the NIH,
under pressure from Congress, reopened its investigation of the affair.
<P>The case against Imanishi-Kari turned on her laboratory records, which she has
always agreed were not kept up-to-date and in good order. She readily admits that
when she could not remember exactly what day she did an experiment, she "probably
did" put vaguely remembered dates on records, months after the fact. That habit
may explain why the matter went as far as it did: the Secret Service, called in
by then Representative John D. Dingell of Michigan to investigate Imanishi-Kari's
notebooks, concluded by analyzing paper and ink that their pages were not written
when the dates on them indicated. That finding forced the Department of Health
and Human Services to dig further. Imanishi-Kari has acknowledged that when the
NIH first investigated her, she pulled together loose papers and incorporated
them into her principal notebook in an attempt to organize the record. (She sent
along to the NIH the empty manila folders that had earlier contained some of the
data, she says, but never saw them again.)
<P>Imanishi-Kari's career bottomed out five years later, when in 1994 Tufts asked
her to take a leave of absence. The request came after the Office of Research
Integrity issued a "final report" concluding that she had "intentionally and
deliberately fabricated and falsified experimental data and results," a finding
that rested heavily on the Secret Service's notebook analysis as well as on
statistical analyses of data. Imanishi-Kari argued that there was no reason she
should stop her research until her appeals were exhausted, but she had to accept
a demotion to contract researcher. As a result, she could no longer teach.
<P>Looking back--something Imanishi-Kari says she does not often do--she laments
the loss to her science and to her private life. "It was just a lot of pain," she
recounts. Her daughter, former husband and faculty colleagues were "very
supportive," and, until she lost her teaching responsibilities, her students
injected enthusiasm for learning that, Imanishi-Kari says, "kept me going." Her
research during the blighted years proceeded slowly, especially when she was
supported only by small grants from the American Cancer Society and the Leukemia
Society. She denies harboring anger over her loss of earnings since 1986:
although her salary "never increased very much" during the several investigations
of her, she says she "never wanted to be rich." Lawyers worked on her defense pro
bono, and scientific supporters met some of the legal expenses.
<P>At this point in our conversation, I learn the truth about her neat-looking
office: it has, she confesses, been tidied and organized in honor of my visit.
The appeals panel that cleared Imanishi-Kari of all charges of misconduct did
criticize her for sloppy record keeping, as well as her collaborators for
allowing the paper to be published "rife with errors of all sorts." Besides the
overstatement of the reagent's power, there were clerical mistakes and an
incorrect description of the cells used in one set of tests (some of the errors
have since been corrected). Imanishi-Kari says she is not sure that the disputed
<I>Cell</I> publication has any more errors than most papers, a thought that
might make scientific editors blanch.
<P>Some observers have speculated that Imanishi-Kari's accented and imperfect
English may have been a significant factor in the case (she came to the U.S. in
1980, having previously lived in Brazil, Japan, Finland and Germany).
Miscommunication between the collaborators on the disputed paper accounted for at
least one misstatement in the paper. But Imanishi-Kari insists that once the
investigations started, she and her colleagues "did listen very carefully" to all
O'Toole's concerns.
<P>Imanishi-Kari is defiant about her innocence, but she regrets not having
insisted that all charges, discussions and findings be formally recorded right
from the earliest stages. Some initial meetings about O'Toole's accusations were
not recorded, she says, and Imanishi-Kari believes that if they had been, things
might have gone differently. "In my own head, I didn't see at that time that it
was going to turn into such a nightmare," she declares. At first, according to
Imanishi-Kari, discussions centered on which data had been used in the
<I>Cell</I> paper, and she provided reasons for her selections. She now advises
all scientists who get caught up in any disputes that go beyond normal scientific
discourse to record allegations, rebuttals and findings and to get a lawyer as
soon as fraud or misconduct is mentioned.
<P>Lawyers, whom as a breed scientists love to hate, finally got Imanishi-Kari
off the hook after scientists working alone had failed. The research integrity
appeals panel, consisting of two lawyers from the Department of Health and Human
Services and an academic immunologist, concluded this past June after a six-week
hearing that much of the evidence against Imanishi-Kari was "internally
inconsistent, lacked reliability or foundation, was not credible or [was] not
corroborated." The panel was the first body not set up to look for misconduct to
weigh the Secret Service's challenge to Imanishi-Kari's data. The panel's
decision is scathingly critical of the Office of Research Integrity's findings,
stating that the evidence is unreliable, in large part irrelevant and
"disconnected from the context of the science." Many of the anomalies the office
identified were in data that were never published, for instance. The office has
lost all its recent big cases on appeal, and the secretary of health and human
services is now considering options for changing the agency's responsibilities.
<P>O'Toole, too, has paid a substantial price: she has said that as a result of
her whistle-blowing she was unable to find work in science for four years. (She
now works for Genetics Institute, a biotechnology company in Cambridge, Mass.)
After the decision of the appeals board, she was quoted in <I>Science,
</I>saying, "Given that this board tossed out the evidence, it is not surprising
that they cannot believe that what I say happened, happened."
<P>Imanishi-Kari, who if found guilty would have been barred from receiving
federal funds, says she intends to continue her career in research. "Now I don't
have to think about the investigation, I should be putting all my energy into
something productive and something good," she remarks. She has published recent
papers on the same system that was explored in her infamous 1986 publication, and
although the effects she was studying are now no longer in the scientific
spotlight, she expresses the hope that she might one day collaborate again with
Baltimore. "You never end finding things," she reflects. "I think there's a lot
of things we don't know."

<P><BR><center><H1>MUCH ADO <BR>ABOUT <BR>NOTHING</H1></center>

<I>by Shawn Carlson</I>

<P>I am convinced that all successful scientists, professional or amateur, start
off as discovery junkies. The experience of making an original find, of knowing
that no one else has ever had your particular insight, is utterly addictive.
There is no better way to feed this addiction than by expanding your laboratory's
capacity for discovery. Last month's column focused on how to create a vacuum--a
process that opens up many marvelous opportunities for exploring nature. This
column completes the discussion by describing how to measure very low pressures.

<P>To cover the range of pressures obtainable by the vacuum system described in
October's column, you'll need two different gauges. One is a mechanical gauge
that responds directly to the force that gas molecules apply to a dia-phragm; it
can record pressures down to about one torr. (A torr is the pressure required to
elevate a column of mercury to a height of one millimeter. One atmosphere is
about 760 torr.) Below this level one needs to resort to more sensitive devices,
such as a so-called Pirani gauge, which can infer the pressure from other,
related properties of a gas. Some such gauges can work above one torr, but they
are much less convenient than the mechanical gauges. In addition to the gauges,
you'll need an assembly that connects them to the vacuum.

<P>The mechanical gauge is an adaptation of the technique to detect such
micromovements as insect heartbeats that I described in the August column. It
relies on the motion of a magnet and a Hall effect transducer (HET), an
inexpensive chip that can be used to sense tiny changes in magnetic fields. You
can purchase one from Honeywell Micro Switch in Freeport, Ill.: call (800)
537-6945 or (815) 235-6847; ask for model number SS94A1F.

<P>First, place a bead of epoxy all around the rim of an old mayonnaise jar's
mouth and stretch over it a thin sheet of Mylar. Once set, epoxy a rare-earth
magnet (Radio Shack; part number 64-1895; $2) to the center of the sheet. Next,
thoroughly coat one rim of a 1/4-inch-diameter brass pipe "tee" with epoxy. Affix
the coated rim to the Mylar, making sure that the rim is centered over the
magnet. After the epoxy has set, with an X-Acto knife gently cut the Mylar at the
rim of the jar and carefully trim the excess Mylar from the pipe fitting.
Finally, affix the HET to the pipe so that its sensitive area is centered on the
Mylar membrane. Epoxy a 1/4-inch-wide plastic washer over the rim and then glue
the HET to the washer. Make sure the HET's sensor is directly over the magnet.

<P>As the pressure inside the tee falls, the Mylar will flex inward and move the
magnet away from the HET. Use the "slowly varying signal" circuit described in
the August column to register the displacement. You'll need to experiment to find
the right gain. If set too high, the instrumentation amplifier will quickly
saturate and thereby become ineffective; too low, the measurement won't be as
sensitive as it could be.

<P>You can build the rest of the vacuum assembly from a few dollars' worth of
brass plumbing parts, all with 1/4-inch diameters. Completely coat with epoxy the
threads of two devices known as hose-barb adapters. Tightly screw them into a
brass pipe tee and epoxy a short length of pipe into the tee's center. To the
other end of this pipe, connect the tee that has your mechanical gauge. Tygon
tubing (check your local hardware store) links the adapters to the 1/4-inch-wide
pipe of your vacuum system.

<P>My simple gauge, which I slapped together in about an hour, bottoms out at
about a couple of torr. There are plenty of ways to improve the performance of
the instrument, and I invite you to experiment with variables such as the
thickness of the Mylar, the area of the membrane, electronics, construction
techniques and so on. I'll happily post your innovations to the Society for
Amateur Scientists's World Wide Web site.

<P>Even the most refined mechanical gauges, however, will not be able to detect
pressures below about one torr. Getting to that range requires a clever
alternative. It turns out that the ability of a gas to conduct heat is nearly
independent of pressure over an amazingly wide range of pressures. Near one torr,
however, the gas becomes so tenuous that its thermal conductivity begins to drop.
This drop continues until the thermal conductivity reaches essentially zero at
about one millitorr. You can exploit the relation to measure pressures between
one torr and one millitorr.

<P>The simplest gauge that measures thermal conductivity is the <A HREF="1196amsci2.html">Pirani gauge</A>. I
tip my inventor's hat to Bruce R. Kendall, a physicist at Pennsylvania State
University, for developing a wonderfully straightforward, robust and inexpensive
type of Pirani gauge. The heart of Kendall's sensor is a glow plug: a
platinum-alloy filament used to fire the cylinders in some types of engines, for
example, diesel. But the Pirani gauge requires a smaller version of the glow
plug, such as those used in model airplanes. They are available at hobby shops
and cost less than $10. I've achieved satisfactory results with the O. S. Engine
model A5, which retails for about $8.

<P>Kendall's device takes advantage of the fact that a metal's electrical
resistance changes with temperature. Kendall connects his glow plug to a source
of constant current and then measures the voltage difference between the leads.
The pressure sets the rate at which heat is conducted from the wire, which in
turn changes the wire's final temperature and therefore its resistance. Because
resistance is simply the voltage across the wire divided by the current flowing
through it, this changing resistance produces a shift of a few millivolts that
you can easily measure.

<P>You'll need a source of constant current that can produce about 1.4 amperes.
The circuit shown at the right is easy to construct and does the trick. The
circuit relies on the AD524 chip, an outstanding instrumentation amplifier
available from Analog Devices in Norwood, Mass.; call (800) 262-5643, ext. 3, for
a local distributor. You can also construct an instrumentation amplifier from
three type 741 operational amplifiers (see August's column for details).

<P>Warning: A few coiled snakes lurk within the power supply. For protection from
the line voltage, encase the circuit inside a project box. The first time I built
this circuit the 4,700 microfarad capacitor blew apart because I installed it
backwards (it could not handle the current flow). Young experimenters should not
build this circuit without adult supervision. Also, because this circuit
generates a respectable amount of heat, you must drill a few arrays of
1/8-inch-wide vent holes in the back of the box. The heat from the 7805 power
supply chip must be drawn away, or the chip will overheat and shut down. Radio
Shack sells an inexpensive heat sink (no. 276-1363, $1) as well as a heat-sink
compound to ensure a good connection (no. 276-1372, $2).

<P>The power supply circuit can deliver at most a continuous current of 1.5
amperes. The Pirani gauge will draw a nominal 1.4 amperes, but the exact current
depends quite sensitively on the value of the power resistor (labeled "R1" in the
schematic). The one-ohm Radio Shack model has a 10 percent tolerance, which means
that its actual value could vary between 0.9 and 1.1 ohms. If it is less than
0.95 ohm, you risk drawing too much current from the power supply. Use a digital
multimeter to ensure that the resistance is above 0.95 ohm.

<P>To secure your Pirani gauge inside the vacuum housing, drill a small hole
through a 1/4-inch-wide brass plug and thread two insulated contact wires through
it. Connect one wire to the glow plug's housing and the other to the terminal at
the bottom so that the glow plug rests as closely as possible to the brass plug.
Next, coat the body of the gauge (but not the filament!) with enamel-based paint
to insulate it electrically from the vacuum housing. Thoroughly fill the hole
with epoxy, then screw the plug into the brass tee. You may be able to keep the
plug from leaking air by wrapping Teflon tape around its threads before screwing
it in, but I had to resort to epoxy. (Teflon tape will enable you to remove the
plug for maintenance--when my glow plug burns out, I'll have to rebuild the whole
assembly).

<P>I have never needed to calibrate a vacuum gauge, and you probably won't
either. That's because many applications require only a rough estimate of the
pressure. And that's a lucky thing because calibrating a low-pressure gauge can
be nightmarish. Its response is often not a linear function of pressure. Pirani
gauges are even worse because their response depends on the particular gas being
evacuated.

<P>But if you're set on calibrating your gauges, you'll have to compare them with
calibrated instruments. I suggest you call on local scientists, who are often
happy to open their laboratory doors for such projects. But no matter how
carefully calibrated your gauge, in real working conditions you'll be lucky if
you can determine the pressure to within a factor of two.

<P>Encyclopedias seem ideally suited to the CD-ROM format. In this new
incarnation they can offer something to everyone, from scholars short on
bookshelf space to students delighted to find that their homework includes
watching cartoon animations that feature digital sound. A few months spent
using six leading encyclopedias indicates that most of them have indeed made a
graceful transition to the brave new world of multimedia. Whereas for some works,
this is simply a matter of putting old--if tasty--wine in new bottles, others are
rapidly mutating into something novel. Asking which is "better" is like deciding
between a screwdriver and a laser pointer: it depends on the task at hand.
<P>Multimedia features are at a minimum in the three high-priced
encyclopedias--the <I>Americana,</I> the <I>Britannica </I>and the
<I>McGraw-Hill</I>--and that turns out to be both good news and bad.
<P>Scientists and enthusiasts of science who prized the hard copy edition of the
<I>McGraw-Hill Multimedia Encyclopedia of Science &AMP; Technology</I> will love
the CD-ROM version. It's lean, mean and effective--a powerful resource that wears
its learning lightly. It installs and boots up without making a fuss, and its
user interface has the intuitive ease that has become almost essential in an age
when savvy computer users would sooner be caught counting on their fingers than
paging through a manual. Its search engine is efficient and free from bothersome
idiosyncrasies. It can display multiple articles simultaneously, each in its own
window, a handy feature. Although it calls itself a "multimedia" encyclopedia,
<I>McGraw-Hill'</I>s fanciest offerings consist of a few dozen rudimentary
animations. Although plain and simple, they are generally accurate and to the
point.
<P><I>Britannica</I> weighs in with the assets one expects from the grande dame
of general encyclopedias--long, authoritative articles that are often written
well enough to keep you reading after you have answered the specific question
that brought you there. Her admirable content aside, however, the old lady shows
alarming signs of being caught in a precarious position, with one foot in the
leatherbound, five-foot bookshelf of her distinguished past and the other in the
departing digital dinghy. Installation can be cranky, the screen displays only a
few hundred words of text at a time, and user support consists of leaving an
answering-machine message that is returned days later if at all. But the glitches
are being repaired (version 2.02 is a big improvement over version 2.0), and 
<I>Britannica'</I>s splendid content certainly counts for a lot.
<P>The publisher claims that <I>Britannica</I> contains more than 2,000
illustrations, but they are kept out of the way and seem almost an afterthought
in comparison with the over 40 million words of text. Nor are there any
animations, video clips or sound files. <I>Americana </I>is staider still.
Nothing more than line drawings and diagrams, not even any photographs, augment
its 25 million words of sober text. This does lend the disk flexibility,
however: because it contains little more than words, the same CD-ROM can be
accessed from Windows or DOS or on a Macintosh. The scientific content of
<I>Americana </I>seems sound, if sometimes a bit dated.
<P>The three shorter, more reasonably priced encyclopedias dwell in the realm of
true multimedia, offering easy access to brief, breezy articles accompanied by
plenty of sounds and moving pictures. Illustrated timelines and ample hypertext
links make them attractive to students, and all three CD-ROMs include educational
games to help younger users get involved.
<P><I>Grolier'</I>s was the first major encyclopedia to go digital, and the
company's experience shows in version 9. But its attractive package often
emphasizes form over substance, leading to quick letdowns for readers who want
to explore a subject in depth. The writing is at once wordy and short, and often
blousy and vapid to boot: "Man-made violence was front-page news all too often,"
says the narrator of a recent-history slideshow, who sounds as if she has no
more idea than anyone else what that is supposed to mean. An animation on nuclear
fusion misses most of the important points while pelting the viewer with
unnecessary jargon.
<P><I>Compton'</I>s is comparably heavy on condiments and short on beef. Although
a breeze to use, it is flawed by a bumptious brashness that tries to pass itself
off as sophistication. Here, as in the fake-leather <I>Compton'</I>s of old, one
constantly runs into sentences that sound less like a reference work than like a
high school term paper cribbed from one. We are informed that "although she
fancied herself a genius and published a number of books and plays, Gertrude
Stein is remembered best for the talented people who visited her in Paris,
France." Much more assured is <I>Compton'</I>s multimedia side, which features a
superior planetarium/space exploration game and six "exploration" programs aimed
at getting kids involved creatively. ShowMaker, which makes it easy for students
to combine material they have gathered from the encyclopedia into a multimedia
presentation, is good, creative fun, despite its bittersweet implication that
pure print is being bid a hasty farewell.
<P><I>Encarta</I> is rather more literate, noting that Gertrude Stein's
"experiments with prose were frequently misunderstood and erroneously construed
as meaningless" and offering a palatable sound clip of an actress reading Stein's
sonorous poem "Susie Asado." Its multimedia embellishments are spotty, with many
lost opportunities: an article on sound recording, amazingly, includes no sound
beyond a dry male voice discussing CD technology, and three seconds of poorly
recorded music intended to demonstrate its capabilities. But there are some
compelling film clips, from Igor Sikorsky piloting a prototype helicopter to
Louis Armstrong singing a snatch of the blues, and good still photographs, too.
To contemplate Aaron Copland's craggy visage while hearing an excerpt from his
"Appalachian Spring" (although the caption is silent about who's conducting it)
is to be reminded that sound can be more moving than moving pictures are.
<P><I>Encarta'</I>s "deluxe" edition comes on not one but two CDs. This ups the
multimedia ante but also entails a lot of disk swapping.
<P>Most of the CD-ROMs reviewed here offer on-line connections capable of
freshening them beyond the dreams of the encyclopedists of old. NASA's claim to
have found evidence of life on Mars, for instance, was available to be downloaded
within days of its making headlines. So while they retain many of their old
faults, multimedia encyclopedias also open out toward a bright future. The very
audacity of the encyclopedias' charter--to encompass the totality of knowledge in
a single publication--remains part of their appeal, as does their inevitable
failure to attain it, even while the Net sings its siren song that all will soon
be known to all.

<P><B>FROM PHYSICS TO METAPHYSICS</B>
<BR><I>by Michael Redhead. <A HREF="http://www.cup.org/">Cambridge University Press</A>, 1995 ($29.95)</I>
<P><B>IS THERE A GOD?</B> 
<BR><I>by Richard Swinburne. <A HREF="http://www.oup-usa.org/">Oxford University Press</A>, 1996 ($19.95)</I>
<P>Everyone has a metaphysics--a worldview--just as all people speak prose,
whether they are aware of it or not. Science can and should contribute to that
worldview, but it should by no means monopolize it. Unless you are one of those
biologists so flushed with the recent success of your discipline that you are
moved to claim that "science is all," you will want to locate scientific
understanding within a wider view of knowledge that gives equally serious
consideration to other forms of human insight and experience. If for convenience
we call the scientific perspective "physics," then we can fittingly call that
stereoscopic view "metaphysics," for it goes beyond ("meta") the purview of
science alone.
<P>As these two very different books demonstrate, there is no unique way to go
from physics to metaphysics. There are, however, conditions of consonance that
place limits on the exercise. Although one view (scientifically obtained or
otherwise) does not determine the full nature of a landscape, it imposes certain
requirements on it: that stretch of water on which the sun is glinting amid the
trees must find some place in the overall scene, whether as the beginning of a
great lake or as the bend in a small river.
<P>Most philosophers agree that metaphysical theories should be elegant,
economical and coherent--even though they may disagree on the application of
those criteria. We can further expect consensus that a metaphysics should explain
the entire set of phenomena that are fundamental to human experience. But even
more disputes arise here: some thinkers espouse a wide view; others treat only a
narrow portfolio of experience as basic. I always encourage my skeptical
scientific friends to adopt a more generous (and, in my view, more adequate)
account of reality. Those who deny the mystery of music, for example, will regard
it simply as the neurological consequence of the impact of air vibrations on the
human eardrum, but nothing requires such an impoverished description. As a
particle physicist and a minister, I often find myself simultaneously convinced
by both exterior and interior perceptions of the underlying structure of the
universe.
<P>Michael Redhead comes at the debate with a sympathy for metaphysics but also
with a strong scientific conservatism. He is a philosopher of physics at the
University of Cambridge; he has a particularly expert knowledge of quantum
theory; and he rightly protests against illegitimate and all too fashionable
importations of consciousness into quantum phenomena. Observations, he affirms,
are physical measurements, not human perceptions--and so the mystical edifices
that many New Age writers have tried to build on quantum mechanics are doomed to
collapse.
<P>Indeed, what Redhead considers the most metaphysically significant aspect of
quantum mechanics is not any mysticism involving Schrdinger's cat but rather the
theory's fundamental nonlocality. Once two quantum entities have interacted with
each other, they retain the ability instantaneously to influence each other,
however widely they may subsequently separate. Albert Einstein considered this
togetherness-in-separation to be so crazy that it must demonstrate that there was
something missing in quantum theory. John Bell, however, cast nonlocality in
testable form, and Alain Aspect and his colleagues confirmed that the property is
in fact a real property of nature.
<P>Redhead views this discovery as evidence that we should take a holistic view
of physical reality. Once they have come together, the two quantum entities
continue to form a single system even after their physical separation. It seems
that the subatomic world cannot be treated as a collection of purely independent
entities. This metaphysical conclusion causes Redhead to look quizzically at the
reductionist claims made by ebullient speculative particle theorists in their
"theories of everything." I do not think that philosophers in general have yet
come to terms with this declaration from quantum physics: the days of Universe as
Mechanism are over.
<P>Contrary to what many of his philosophical colleagues claim, Redhead does not
believe that scientists simply mold physical experience into the pleasing shapes
that fit their intellectual fancy. It is refreshing to encounter a philosopher of
science who does not take it on himself to lecture scientists that they are
involved in a socially constructed language game or that instead of learning
about the physical world they are simply finding empirically adequate ways of
talking about it--using ideas that are fine for getting things done but that
should not be taken as serious descriptions of the world. Redhead, like almost
all scientists, is a realist; he believes that we make reliable maps of our
physical environment, although, like all maps, they do not reveal absolutely
every detail of the terrain. The physical world resists our attempts to twist it
into the form of our prior expectations.
<P>Past this rather limited conclusion, however, Redhead will not venture.
Richard Swinburne, in contrast, takes into account a much wider range of
phenomena, and his metaphysical proposal is correspondingly much more ambitious
than Redhead's. Swinburne is a well-known philosopher of religion who has just
written the first popular introduction to his main ideas. In his new book, he
boldly suggests that the best-supported and most comprehensive theory of
everything is in fact provided by belief in God (understood in the sense of the
Judeo-Christian-Islamic tradition as "a person, omnipotent, omniscient, and
perfectly free"). In so doing, he seeks to provide an explicit rejoinder to the
philosophical navet&#233; and atheistic reductionism that he detects in writers such
as Richard Dawkins and Stephen W. Hawking.
<P>The keystone of Swinburne's argument is that the creative will of God
"provides by far the simplest explanation of all phenomena." Such judgments of
simplicity are always open to dispute because they depend on the criteria and
viewpoint of the one making the judgment. A physical reductionist, wearing the
equations of the supposed Grand Unified Theory on his or her T-shirt, would
probably also claim to be starting from a simple origin. The real grounds for
disagreement between such a person and Swinburne would seem to lie in the
question of the adequacy of their respective hypotheses to explain the
many-layered reality of human experience. (We are back to the mystery of music.)
To take one example: Do we just accept science's wonderful power to describe the
order of the world through beautiful mathematical equations, or do we see therein
the hint of a divine mind at work? Swinburne writes, "I do not deny that science
explains, but I postulate God to explain why science explains."
<P>But once having postulated God, Swinburne finds himself caught in a conundrum
that troubles many believers: how to reconcile the primacy of a creator with the
existence of so much evil and suffering in the world. He is candid enough to
admit that "it is inevitable that any attempt by myself or anyone else to
construct a theodicy (to justify the ways of God) will sound callous, indeed
totally insensitive to human suffering." There are many religious responses to
the mystery of pain and evil, but they lie at deeper, more existential levels
than those plumbed by mere logical argument. The nearest Swinburne gets to such
depths is a discussion of the evidential value of religious experience.
<P>These two books present telling contrasts in the ways to construct a modern
metaphysics. Redhead is cautious, looking to physics but not much beyond it. He
lays aside the great questions of meaning and purpose for others to answer.
Swinburne is bolder and takes into account a much richer range of human
experience, but he then finds himself with more problems to answer for. He is
respectful of science within its proper domain, but he knows that domain to be
self-limited to what is impersonal and repeatable. If we are to fulfill the
ambition, so natural to the scientist, to understand fully the world in which we
live, we shall have to be prepared to take the wide view.

<P><B>IN SEARCH OF NATURE</B> <BR><I>by Edward O. Wilson. Island Press, 1996
($19.95).</I>

<P><B>BIODIVERSITY II</B> <BR><I>edited by Marjorie L. Reaka-Kudla, Don E. Wilson and
Edward O. Wilson. Joseph Henry Press, 1996 ($34.95).</I>

<P>Why should we care if other species go extinct? These books offer the short
and long answer to the question. Edward O. Wilson's solo offering makes the case
in a series of brief, elegant essays; he also gives a clear introduction to his
controversial ideas on sociobiology. The edited anthology methodically pieces
together the extent of biodiversity, the threats it faces and the practical
measures needed to preserve it. Although not aimed at the lay public, these
papers should not intimidate anyone with a serious interest in the subject.

<a name="night"></a>
<P><HR><B>THE NIGHT IS LARGE</B> <BR><I>by Martin Gardner. St. Martin's Press, 1996
($29.95).</I>

<P>Martin Gardner was this magazine's "Mathematical Games" columnist for over a
quarter of a century; the 47 essays in this volume (written between 1938 and the
present) show how mathematics has informed but never limited the scope of his
inquiry. Discussions of Shakespeare and God mingle with a stinging critique of
supply-side economics and a rumination on the failure of the "new math." The
parts are unified, in Gardner's words, by "this sense of endless, unfathomable
magic that envelops almost everything I have written."

<a name="small"></a>
<P><HR><B>IN SMALL THINGS FORGOTTEN</B> <BR><I>by James Deetz. Anchor Books, 1996
($11).</I>

<P>History is pretty much junk, one might conclude after finishing this breezy
introduction to historical archaeology. Poring over estate listings, pottery
shards, gravestones and excavated foundations, James Deetz reconstructs the
changing face of American life during the colonial era, as immigrant traditions
and aesthetics adapted to the New World. The book makes a powerful argument for
an empirical kind of history far removed from the anonymous assertions of high
school textbooks.

<a name="yesterday"></a>
<P><HR><B>YESTERDAY'S TOMORROWS</B> <BR><I>by Joseph J. Corn and Brian Horrigan. Johns
Hopkins University Press, 1996 ($24.95).</I>

<P>This paperback reissue derives from an exhibit organized by the Smithsonian
Institution in 1984. On page after page of fantasy images (from films,
advertisements, comic books and so on), our hopes and fears about the future are
charmingly, sometimes painfully, laid bare. The accompanying essays, alas, still
bear the marks of hastily assembled wall text; they are disjointed and rife
with editorial errors.

<a name="mars"></a>
<P><HR><B>THE CASE FOR MARS</B> <BR><I>by Robert Zubrin with Richard Wagner. Free Press,
1996 ($25).</I>

<P>Undaunted by the flawed visions of past prognosticators, Robert Zubrin argues
that humans can--and must--establish colonies on Mars. He carries the reader
along swiftly with his enthusiastic technical, financial and social arguments.
The closing appeal for readers to become "space activists" brings the argument
back down to Earth: spectacular ventures to Mars will occur only when the public
deems such costly undertakings worthwhile.

<P><HR><B>MICROCOSMOS</B> <BR><I>directed by Claude Nuridsany and Marie P&#233;rennou.
Miramax Films, 1996 (opens October 11).</I>

<P>Biologists Claude Nuridsany and Marie P&#233;rennou left the university to
seek new ways to communicate science to the public. Microcosmos focuses on
the daily life of the insects and other tiny creatures that inhabit a field in
the south of France. Dispensing with narration, the film relies on sharp camera
work, stop-motion photography and a clever soundtrack to keep the action moving.
The flashes of anthropomorphism are entertaining and deliberate: the filmmakers
slyly transform their buggy actors into empathetic characters.

<FONT SIZE=+2>WONDERS</font>
<BR>by <B>Philip Morrison</B>          
<H2>GIANT AGAINST GIANT <BR>IN THE DARK</H2>
Any seashore is an open frontier, a source of novelty as unceasing as the waves
themselves. Once on a summer morning I came across a dozen blue-crested,
translucent bladders the size of footballs, strewn windblown over the wetted
sands. They were festooned with what I recognized as the stinging filaments of
Portuguese man-of-wars, the poetic common name of this species. Organized
colonies of living polyps found worldwide on warm sea surfaces, they were at once
beautiful and a bit frightening. A casual beachcomber is justified in recalling
such a surprise for half a lifetime, although it is by no means exceptional.
<P>One truly exceptional sort of flotsam has been found from Norway to New
Zealand. A published master list records some 200 similar verified shoreline
finds over the past 350 years. A startled stroller--or an offshore fisherman
emptying a net--comes on a solitary big sea animal, beached, dead or dying. That
creature is hardly credible: a tentacled form fathoms long, with huge staring
eyes and a parrot beak! Half-myths of folklore and print expound these tangible
remains. A few real if confused encounters at sea are vividly recalled, too,
dizzily extrapolated by authors and image makers from the days of epics up to
Jules Verne, Arthur C. Clarke and Disney Studios. Surely all these sightings earn
the arresting name of sea monster; they are in fact giant squid.
<P>What may or may not be a single species is dubbed <I>Architeuthis,</I>
naturalists' Latin for "extreme squid." Measured lengths reach up to 60 feet
overall, including the tentacles, stout sucker-bearing arms and a jet-propelled
torpedo body that may run up to as much as a ton or two in mass. A similar body
plan can be found in plenty at your own local fish market, of course much reduced
in scale: the eight-inch-long calamari. Our own kind, the vertebrates, has
included huge sharks, ancient reptiles and, more recently, fossil super-rhinos
from the Gobi Desert. Indeed, the biggest animal of all time is a modern
vertebrate, the blue whale; the largest known invertebrate ever is the giant
squid. Dwelling today at depth, monstrous <I>Architeuthis</I> has never yet been
observed in vigorous life by any zoologist.
<P>On the alert for wonders of sky and sea, I have wandered beaches for years now
with a recurrent thought. Might an unusual form appear awash in the breaking
waves, delivering up--possibly this morning!--a giant squid? My dreamy hopes
almost came true in 1980, when one, if only a young female 30 feet long, was cast
up on a wintry beach north of Ipswich, only 30 highway miles from our
Massachusetts city home. I missed seeing that find aground, but even skeptics can
inspect the remains at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History,
embalmed whole in cold, clear isopropyl alcohol but manifestly real. (A really
big martini, said the wit who prepared it.)
<P>Squid are a populous order. Oxygen-thirsty, flesh-hungry, feeding on fish and
smaller squid, they are fast-moving, wary predators in the colder waters of all
the wide oceans. Curiously evolved mollusks, they have inverted their inherited
clamlike body plan to present not a shell but a leathery mantle and a head-borne
cluster of arms and tentacles. (Within every giant squid's mantle is stowed its
vestigial heirloom, a chitinous rod a few feet long.)
<P>So few have come ashore as corpses that we might think them rare indeed, for a
50-foot squid is hard to hide forever even in the depths of the sea. Where can
such monsters live and die unseen? By a stunningly improbable indirection, we
have found them as links in the food chain of other giants. <I>Architeuthis,</I>
as gigantic as it is, its glassy eyes as large as pizzas, is in fact customary
prey for a much more massive hunter, the toothed sperm whale. That 20-ton cousin
of ours feeds mostly on squid of all sizes. The stomachs of caught sperm whale
often hold 5,000 to 10,000 squid beaks, many of tremendous size. Whale foreheads
bear ring marks that fit the sucker disks of struggling giant squid, and almost
every dissected sperm whale yields quite fresh chunks of squid tentacles, often
small, but some as thick as a robust harpooner's thigh. The estimate is a
precarious one, but it is plausible that the worldwide squid fishery, long
operated by the million sperm whales now alive, takes tens of millions of giant
squid every year, comparable in annual tonnage to any human fishery in the salt
sea.
<P>Smithsonian zoologist Clyde F. E. Roper, seafarer since his boyhood on Ipswich
Bay, has long been on the track of <I>Architeuthis </I>alive. It was he who led
the collection, study and preservation of the Massachusetts specimen, and his
current exhibit bears witness to the breadth of his knowledge and researcher's
passion. A squid gourmet, he certifies that the whales need fear no human
competition for their big catch. Carefully tasting a fresh-frozen tentacle
fragment, he and his companions unanimously found its flesh bitterly ammoniacal,
beyond human tolerance. Animals of the deep avoid both the surface  and the
bottom of the sea. The giant squid has adapted to near-neutral buoyancy by
replacing the sodium chloride usual in body fluids with the much lighter ions of
ammonium chloride.
<P>Good news came this year to the hunters of <I>Architeuthis.</I> Over the past
decade, the commercial fishermen of New Zealand have pioneered a deep fishery for
new, tasty fish species. They often trawl eastward of Wellington where the
seafloor drops sharply to the abyss. There sperm whales, too, are frequent
hunters. A few astonished fishing boats have reported netting giant squid too
cumbersome to carry home, and at the end of 1995 two New Zealand research ships
came back with 10-yard squid brought up dead in their nets.
<P>The search for living giant squid will begin in these game-rich depths. Roper
has planned a powerful international exploration of the steep Kaikoura canyon,
where a diverse fauna supports giant predators and giant prey alike. His team
unites New Zealand research ships, crew-carrying submersibles (the <I>Johnson
Sea-Links </I>out of Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute in Fiorida), many
university scientists from the U.S., Australia and New Zealand, and a seasoned
deepwater video production team from the National Geographic Society. This
stirring chase live on television will amaze viewers in homes and classrooms
across the world.
<P>How does a sperm whale catch giant squid? Can we enlist some squid-stalking
whale to carry camera and light under sonar control? What is the wider ecological
context of this combat of giants? The unprecedented expedition is fully planned
and already substantially funded. Under one third of the needed $5 million
remains to be found by next year's season at the end of 1997. Few readers may
have that sum about them, but their articulated public enthusiasm can be a
nourishing substrate for a few new major supporters of this long-ripe, hopeful
adventure, a voyage as mythic, strange and penetrating as any at sea.

<H2>WHAT GOES AROUND <BR>COMES AROUND</H2>

Back in the dawn of time, I reported for the BBC whenever an <I>Apollo</I> lifted
off. So nowadays every time a shuttle comes back for recycling, I am reminded of
those great "use once and throw away" days. On one of which, in 1973, a crew went
up to the orbiting <I>Skylab</I> (itself a piece of converted leftover
<I>Apollo</I> hardware), where major discoveries were being made about the solar
corona having dark bits in it, which meant significant things to those interested
in solar wind.

<P>When you think "Apollo," you can't help but think "Wernher von Braun"-- the
German-born engineer who made possible those extraordinary Saturn V launch
vehicles. As he himself said, he'd had lots of earlier practice with all those
wartime missiles (a.k.a. vengeance weapons) that left Peenem&#252;nde regularly and
at very high speeds, heading for England (and me).

<P>Devilishly difficult things to hit, buzz bombs. At first it took the
antiaircraft gunners an average of 2,500 rounds to bring one down. Then (and on
behalf of the U.K., I thank you, Bell Labs), along came the M-9 Predictor, and
the cost of bagging a doodlebug went down to 100 shells. Significant savings all
around (including lives). All it took was the magic math to run a feedback loop
that could update constantly the set of data you got from the radar about the
incoming buzz bomb's <I>last</I> position, so as to be able to make a good guess
at its <I>next</I> and to point the guns that way. Then boom.

<P>The idea of feedback came to those involved with guns and such from those
involved with gastric juices and such. Physiology had been looking at the body's
internal balancing systems (you know: if hot, sweat; if thirsty, drink) ever
since a mid-19th-century Beaujolais winegrower and physiologist called Claude
Bernard first noticed something odd about rabbits. Simply,  if they were given no
food for a while, the bunnies appeared to live off themselves (off their reserves
of fat, we would say today). The difference in diet showed up in their urine.
Which led Bernard to further discoveries, such as how the liver secreted exactly
the amount of sugar you happened to be short of (or not, if not). And after that,
all the rest of those reactions that happen in order to maintain what we now call
homeostasis.

<P>Mind you, there were those who were far from happy about the rabbits--and the
dogs, frogs, guinea pigs and rats--on which Bernard and others performed their
diverse tests. Some of which, in all honesty, might not have been strictly
unavoidable. (Bernard said, "The science of life is a superb and dazzling
lighted hall which may be reached only by passing through a long and ghastly
kitchen.") It was rather too much for Bernard's wife, who left him and joined the
antivivisectionists, one of whom was an Englishwoman, Anna Kingsford. She spent
most of her time in Paris, directing her energies into <I>killing</I> Bernard
(and other high-profile physiologists, such as Paul "the Bends" Bert) with
thought waves.

<P>The antivivisection group eventually was embraced, mistakenly, by the Humane
Society movement. In fact, such societies had existed since the 18th century, and
they weren't there to save animals at all. Only the "apparently drowned," and
human at that. Many of these unfortunates had, for various questionable reasons,
simply fallen into water. But there was a less dubious motive for being
considered apparently drowned. What you did to qualify was to jump overboard when
your ship was on the rocks and there was nowhere else to go. Then, with a bit of
luck, you would be rescued by an offshoot of the Humane Society called (in 1824)
the National Institution for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck.

<P>The reason for the Shipwreck Institution's cork-lined boats and crews was that
by this time there were simply many more ships heading for trouble rather than
for port. What with the extra cargo floating across the oceans, thanks to the
Industrial Revolution, with tons of manufactured goods going one way and raw
materials the other, more money was being lost than ever before when people's
ships didn't come in. Hence, the fuss and cork.

<P>All the more so after mid-century, when American naval officer Matthew F.
Maury (see last November's column) got hundreds of navigators to keep (and send
him) logs of wind, pressure, temperature and currents. He also persuaded them to
throw daily bottles into the sea (sealed) carrying bits of paper on which they
had scribbled their latitude, longitude and the date. Said bottles were to be
picked up by others doing the same. Result: a zillion details on wind and current
conditions, which led to one of Maury's famous publications, <I>Sailing
Directions</I>. These illustrated, as such, oceanic expressways and indicated the
fastest--read "cheapest"--route from any point A to any point B.

<P>Another source of Maury's knowledge of wind and water was the French physicist
J.B.L. Foucault, who some years earlier had invented an amazing pendulum, which
hung on a very long wire and proved that the earth turned. As an inertial
pendulum swings back and forth, it appears with each swing to trace a changing
path (clockwise, in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa down South). Maury
deduced from this that as the planetary surface rotates, the path of winds in the
Northern Hemisphere coming up from the equator would be deflected to the east
(and vice versa).

<P>Foucault's inertial investigations led him to other matters affected by the
turning planet. Life for astronomers wasn't made any easier by the fact that,
because of the earth's rotation, they and their telescopes were whizzing around
at a fair lick (no observational pun intended), making it hard to keep an eye on
stars and stuff that, after all, were not doing the same thing. So Foucault came
up with a clockwork gizmo (well, siderostat) that rotated a mirror 360 degrees,
in the opposite direction to the earth's, once every 24 hours.

<P>This technique kept the mirror constantly pointing at its heavenly target.
This also made it easier for Foucault to do his next trick: use the astonishing
new daguerreotype photographic apparatus to get portraits of various celestial
bodies, now that they sat in the frame long enough for you to take their picture.

<P>This nifty process went over very big with stargazers, because you can do
great things with photographs of stars (like count them or overexpose them and
see many more). So in K&#246;nigsberg, Germany, during the 1851 eclipse, a
professional named Berkowski took the first photograph of the phenomenon that the
<I>Skylab</I> crew would study, from orbit, 122 years later: the solar corona.

<P>Proof that in the world of connections (and orbits), what goes around indeed
comes around.

<BR>To those of us who have spent a good part of our lives studying <A HREF="http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/mars.html">Mars</A>, the
newly discovered evidence that extraterrestrial microbes may have once lived in a
rock cast off from that planet stirs feelings of awe. But the recent claim also
evokes thoughts of <A HREF="http://mars98www.jpl.nasa.gov/mgs/canals.html">Percival Lowell</A>, a well-known American astronomer of the early
20th century, who turned his telescope toward Mars and saw a vast <A HREF="http://www.bibliomania.com/NonFiction/Lowell/Mars/map.htm">network of
canals</A> bordered by vegetation. His suggestion that Mars harbored such lushness
had many people believing that the surface of the planet enjoyed conditions not
so different from those on Earth. But in the 1960s three <A HREF="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/mip/mnr4.html"><I>Mariner</I>
spacecraft</A> flew by Mars and revealed the true harshness of its environment.
<P>Observations from those unmanned probes indicated that Mars has an atmosphere
that is thin, cold and dry. This tenuous shroud, composed almost entirely of
carbon dioxide, provides less than 1 percent of the surface pressure found at sea
level on Earth. The images radioed back during those first fleeting encounters
three decades ago were fuzzy and few in number, but they were decidedly more
accurate than Lowell's telescopic views. The <I>Mariner </I>cameras showed no
canals, no water and no vegetation. They presented only a <A HREF="http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/imgcat/html/mission_page/MR_Mariner_9_page1.html">moonlike surface
covered with craters</A>. Sober scientists quickly dismissed any notion that the
climate on Mars was sufficiently warm or wet to sustain life.

With its distant orbit--50 percent farther from the sun than Earth--and slim
atmospheric blanket, Mars experiences <A HREF="http://humbabe.arc.nasa.gov/MGCM.html">frigid weather conditions</A>. Surface
temperatures typically average about -60 degrees Celsius (-76 degrees Fahrenheit)
at the equator and can dip to -123 degrees C near the poles. Only the midday sun
at tropical latitudes is warm enough to thaw ice on occasion, but any liquid
water formed in this way would evaporate almost instantly because of the low
atmospheric pressure.
<P>Although the atmosphere holds a small amount of water, and water-ice <A HREF="http://bang.lanl.gov/solarsys/marscld.htm">clouds</A>
sometimes develop, most Martian weather involves blowing dust or carbon dioxide.
Each winter, for example, a blizzard of frozen carbon dioxide rages over one
pole, and a few meters of this dry-ice snow accumulate as previously frozen
carbon dioxide evaporates from the opposite polar cap. Yet even on the summer
pole, where the sun remains in the sky all day long, temperatures never warm
enough to melt frozen water.
<P>Despite the abundant evidence for cold, dry conditions, the impression of Mars
as a perpetually freeze-dried world has been steadily giving way since the
<I>Mariner </I>probes first reported their findings. Planetary scientists, who
continue to examine the voluminous data from both the Mariner and the later
<A HREF="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/mip/viking.html">Viking missions of the 1970s</A>, now realize that Mars has had a complex climatic
history--one that was perhaps punctuated with many relatively warm episodes. At
certain times, huge volumes of water flowed freely across the surface of the
planet. Before considering what this astonishing fact means for the possibility
of life evolving on Mars or the strategy for the next round of Martian
exploration <A HREF="1196kargelbox5.html">(which is just now getting under way)</A>, it is
instructive to review how this reversal in the way Mars is perceived came about.

<B><A NAME="1">Muddy Recollections</A></B>
<P>Scrutinizing the <I>Mariner</I> and <A HREF="http://www-pdsimage.wr.usgs.gov/PDS/public/mapmaker/mapmkr.htm"><I>Viking </I>images</A> obtained from orbit,
planetary scientists soon noticed that most old Martian craters (unlike lunar
ones) are eroded and that features resembling mudflows occur around almost every
large, young crater on Mars. Such <A HREF="http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/imgcat/html/object_page/vo1_003a07.html">muddy "ejecta"</A> probably represent the frozen
remnants of a cataclysmic moment in the past when an asteroid or comet collided
with the Martian surface, melting a patch of icy permafrost (where
water-saturated ground had been frozen) and excavating a large hole that tapped a
zone containing liquid water deep underground. By the late 1970s planetologists
concluded that a considerable amount of underground ice and water has been
present below the Martian surface throughout much of the history of the planet.
<P>Yet not all Martian craters have these muddy flows surrounding them. Smaller
craters appear more like their counterparts on the moon, with just streaks of dry
ejecta scattered around them. Near the equator of Mars, only craters greater than
about four kilometers in diameter display muddy ejecta, but closer to the Martian
poles, craters as small as one kilometer across also have relic mudflows. This
dependence on latitude arises because the ice-free, surficial layer varies in
thickness. This layer extends deeper near the equator (to about 800 meters) than
near the poles because the relative warmth of the Martian tropics purges much of
the subsurface of frozen water. Hence, near the equator only the impact of bigger
objects (that is, those that leave relatively large craters) will burrow down
through the upper layer to heat the underlying icy permafrost and release a
torrent of mud.
<P>Researchers have since found other indications that a thick substratum of
frozen ground exists on Mars. They have also identified evidence that ice once
formed on the surface, where it appears to have created characteristic glacial
landscapes. These features include bouldery ridges of sediment left by melting
glaciers at their margins and meandering lines of sand and gravel deposited
beneath glaciers by streams running under the ice (so-called <A HREF="http://www.geo.duke.edu/geo41/gl1039.gif">eskers</A>).
<P>Many telltale landforms on Mars resemble frosty sites on Earth. For example,
the pitted terrain on Mars corresponds to an earthly equivalent called
<A HREF="http://www.gcrio.org/geo/frozen.html">thermokarst</A>, which forms when the ice contained at shallow levels melts and the
ground collapses. The apron-shaped lobes of rocky debris seen on the flanks of
some Martian mountains might be rubble-covered glaciers. Or, more likely, they
represent "rock glaciers," like the ones that form within the Alaska Range and in
the Antarctic Dry Valleys on Earth. These distinctive sloping surfaces result
after thousands of freeze-thaw cycles cause the top meter or so of water-soaked
ground to creep slowly downhill.
<P>Glacial features and muddy ejecta around craters are not the only examples of
water shaping the Martian surface. In some places, sinuous valleys one kilometer
wide and many hundreds of kilometers long form large branching networks. <A HREF="http://astrosun.tn.cornell.edu/faculty/sagan/sagan.html">Carl
Sagan</A> of Cornell University, <A HREF="http://www.lpl.arizona.edu/grad/academic/faculty/baker2.html">Victor R. Baker</A> of the University of Arizona and
their colleagues suggested in the 1970s that such troughs were created by running
water. Other Martian valleys have blunt starting points and short tributaries,
characteristics that are typical of erosion by groundwater "sapping." That
process, common on Earth, results from the seepage of water from underground
springs, which causes the overlying rock and soil to wash away.
<P>Images of Mars also reveal enormous outflow channels etched on the surface.
Some of these structures are more than 200 kilometers wide and can stretch for
2,000 kilometers or more. These channels emanate from what is called chaotic
terrain, regions of fractured, jumbled rocks that apparently collapsed when
groundwater suddenly surged outward. The ensuing floods carved the vast channels,
leaving streamlined islands more than 100 kilometers long and gouging cavernous
potholes several hundred meters deep. Baker compared the Martian outflow channels
to similar, albeit smaller, flood features found on Earth in parts of Oregon and
Washington State. Those so-called channeled scablands of the Pacific Northwest
formed after a glacier that had dammed a large lake broke open suddenly and
caused a catastrophic flood.
<P>The geometry of the Martian outflow channels indicates that water could have
flowed along the surface as rapidly as 75 meters per second (170 miles per hour).
<A HREF="http://www.vsc.washington.edu/news/carr.html">Michael H. Carr</A> of the U.S. Geological Survey estimates that the vast quantity of
water necessary to create these many enormous channels would have been enough to
fill a global Martian ocean that was 500 meters deep, although not all this
liquid flowed at one time. One source for that great quantity of water may have
been a deep lake in <A HREF="http://ic-www.arc.nasa.gov/fia/projects/bayes-group/Atlas/Mars/features/v/valles_marineris.html">Valles Marineris</A>, a region on Mars partly covered with
sedimentary layers that appear to be ancient lake deposits. Water could also have
gushed from a large reservoir under ice-impregnated permafrost that had been
warmed by heat from the interior of the planet.
<P>Why should such an underground accumulation of water suddenly inundate the
surface? Scientists are unsure of the exact cause, but this groundwater might
have started to flow after the icy permafrost capping it thinned and weakened,
perhaps because of a sudden climate warming, volcanism or tectonic uplift.
Perhaps a large meteor impact or quake triggered the cataclysmic dousing. Once
water broke through to the surface, carbon dioxide from saturated groundwater--a
Martian seltzer of sorts--may have erupted in tremendous geysers, further
undermining the stability of the saturated underground layers. The result was to
produce chaotic terrain and to unleash floods and mudflows of a magnitude that
has rarely, if ever, been matched by any earthly deluge.

<B><A NAME="2">An Ocean Away</A></B>
<P>Some highland areas on Mars contain extensive systems of valleys that drained
into sediment-floored depressions. These lowlands were at one time full of water.
The largest of these Martian lakes filled two gigantic impact basins called
<A HREF="http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/imgcat/html/object_page/vo1_097a62.html">Hellas</A> and <A HREF="http://fi-www.arc.nasa.gov/fia/projects/bayes-group/Atlas/Mars/features/a/argyre_planitia.html">Argyre</A>.
<P>But these lakes may not have been the largest bodies of water on the planet.
Research groups led by David H. Scott and Kenneth L. Tanaka of the <A HREF="http://www.usgs.gov/">U.S.
Geological Survey</A> and by Jeffrey M. Moore of the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration <A HREF="http://www.arc.nasa.gov/">Ames Research Center</A> independently concluded that repeated floods
from the outflow channels emptied to the north and formed a succession of
transient lakes and seas. We have interpreted many features bordering these
ancient basins as marking where glaciers once emptied into these deep bodies of
water. Tanaka and Moore believe that thick layers of sediment deposited in these
seas now stretch across much of the extensive northern plains. According to
several estimates, one of the larger of the northern seas on Mars could have
displaced the combined volume of the Gulf of Mexico and the Mediterranean Sea.
<P>Yet even that great body of water may not have been the supreme example: there
may have been a Mars ocean. As early as 1973 the late <A HREF="http://www.sas.upenn.edu/geology/henry.html">Henry Faul</A> of the
University of Pennsylvania raised this intriguing possibility in a paper he
romantically entitled "The Cliff of Nix Olympica." Understandably, given the
paucity of observations then available, the paper was never accepted for
publication. But during the past decade, other researchers, working with
information acquired during the Viking missions, have revived Faul's idea.
<P>For instance, in 1989 Timothy J. Parker and his colleagues at the <A HREF="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/">Jet
Propulsion Laboratory</A> in Pasadena, Calif., again proposed a northern ocean
(arguing that many features in the northern plains looked as if they had resulted
from coastal erosion). To enhance prospects for publication, however, they
deliberately obscured the provocative thrust of their work with the mundane title
"Transitional Morphology in the West Deuteronilus Mensae Region of Mars:
Implications for Modification of the Lowland/Upland Boundary." In a subsequent
paper, these researchers ventured a more direct title to convey their ideas:
"Coastal Geomorphology of the Martian Northern Plains." Motivated in part by such
work, Baker and several colleagues (including us) named this hypothetical
northern ocean Oceanus Borealis. We calculated that it was possibly four times as
large as the <A HREF="http://www.teachersoft.com/Library/ref/atlas/oceans/xq.htm">Arctic Ocean</A> on Earth, and we proposed a scenario for the actions of
the water cycle on Mars that could have accounted for it.
<P>Whereas most planetary scientists now agree that large bodies of water formed
repeatedly in the northern plains on Mars, many do not accept that there was ever
a true ocean there. Some envision that only a vast, muddy slurry, or mud ocean,
existed. In any case, it is clear that huge amounts of water once flowed over the
surface of Mars. Yet the fate of that water remains unknown. Some of it may have
percolated into the subsurface and frozen in permafrost. Some may have frozen in
place and might now stretch across much of the floor of the northern plains,
hidden by a mantle of dust and sand. Some water may simply have evaporated, to be
later lost to space or deposited as snow at the poles.
<P><B><A NAME="3">Trust the Old Salts</A></B>
<P>Although images of the landforms left by ancient glaciers, river valleys,
lakes and seas are strong testament that Mars was once rich in water, evidence
comes from other sources as well. Earth-based spectroscopic measurements of Mars
reveal the presence of clay minerals. Even more directly, the two landers that
set down on the surface during the <A HREF="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/mip/viking.html">Viking program</A> analyzed Martian soil and found
that it probably contains 10 to 20 percent salts. Martian rocks, like those on
Earth, react to form salt and clay minerals when exposed to water. But such
chemical weathering probably cannot occur under the cold and dry conditions that
now reign on Mars.
<P>Some scientists have also studied Martian rocks found here on Earth. These
rare samples of the Martian surface were blasted into space by the impact of an
asteroid or comet and later fell to Earth as meteorites. <A HREF="http://cass.jsc.nasa.gov./abtreiman.html">Allan H. Treiman</A> of the
<A HREF="http://cass.jsc.nasa.gov/lpi.html">Lunar and Planetary Institute</A> in Houston and James L. Gooding of the <A HREF="http://www-sn.jsc.nasa.gov/msn_mat.htm">NASA Johnson
Space Center</A> have shown in the past several years that minerals in some of these
so-called <A HREF="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/snc/">SNC meteorites</A> were chemically altered by cool, salty water, whereas
others were affected by warmer hydrothermal solutions. Their conclusions imply
that Mars once had a relatively warm, wet climate and may have had hot springs.
Just perhaps, conditions were right for life.
<P>That possibility inspired <A HREF="http://ilewg.jsc.nasa.gov/register/dmckay/bio.htm">David S. McKay</A> of the nasa Johnson Space Center and
his colleagues to examine an SNC meteorite for signs of <A HREF="http://www.sciam.com/WEB/explorations/081996explorations.html">ancient Martian life</A>.
Although their conclusion that fossil microbes are present is open to debate (and
a vigorous one is indeed going on), the composition of the rock they
studied--with fractures filled by minerals that probably precipitated from an
aqueous solution--indicated that conditions on Mars a few billion years ago would
have been compatible with the existence of life.
<P>In agreement with this assessment, many atmospheric physicists had already
concluded that Mars has lost immense quantities of water vapor to space over
time. Their theoretical calculations are in good accord with measurements made by
various Soviet space probes that showed oxygen and hydrogen atoms (derived from
breakdown of atmospheric water exposed to sunlight) streaming away from Mars. The
continuous loss of these elements implies that Mars must once have had all the
water needed to fill an Oceanus Borealis.
<P>But water was not the only substance lost. Recently David M. Kass and <A HREF="http://www.gps.caltech.edu/faculty/yung/yung.html">Yuk L.
Yung</A> of the California Institute of Technology examined the evolution of carbon
dioxide--a potent greenhouse gas--in the atmosphere of Mars. They found that over
time an enormous quantity of carbon dioxide has escaped to space. That amount of
gaseous carbon dioxide would have constituted a thick Martian atmosphere with
three times the pressure found at the surface of Earth. The <A HREF="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/staff/blynds/learn/act2.html">greenhouse effect</A>
from that gas would have been sufficient to warm most of the surface of Mars
above the freezing point of water. Thus, from this perspective, too, it seems
quite plausible that the climate on Mars once was much warmer and wetter than it
is today.
<P>Yet many questions remain about how water might have arranged itself on the
surface of Mars: Was there actually an ocean? Did water shift rapidly between
different reservoirs? When and for how long was Mars wet? Although the absolute
timing of these events remains unknown, most researchers believe that water
sculpted the surface of Mars at many intervals throughout the history of the
planet. The constant loss of water and carbon dioxide from the atmosphere
suggests that early epochs on Mars (that is, billions of years ago) may have been
especially warm and wet. But some balmy periods may also have been relatively
recent: <A HREF="http://www.lpl.arizona.edu/grad/academic/faculty/swindle.html">Timothy D. Swindle</A> of the University of Arizona and his colleagues
studied minerals in an SNC meteorite created by aqueous alteration and determined
that they formed 300 million years ago--a long time by human standards but only a
few percent of the age of the 4.6-billion-year-old solar system. Their result
was, however, accompanied by a considerable degree of uncertainty.
<P>The duration of the wet periods on Mars is also difficult to gauge exactly. If
the eroded Martian landscapes formed under conditions typical of terrestrial
glacial environments, more than a few thousand but less than about a million
years of warm, wet climate were required. Had these conditions endured
substantially longer, erosion would have presumably erased all but traces of a
few impact craters, just as it does on Earth.
<P>This limitation does not apply to the earliest history of the planet, billions
of years ago, before the craters now visible had formed. A young Mars may well
have had vigorous erosion smoothing its face. But eventually, as the planet
slipped toward middle age, its visage became cold, dry and pockmarked. Only
scattered intervals of warmth have since rejuvenated the surface of the planet in
certain regions. Yet the mechanism that causes Mars to switch between mild and
frigid regimes remains largely mysterious. Scientists can now venture only crude
explanations for how these climate changes might have occurred.

Touma and <A HREF="http://prufrock.mit.edu/academic_web/plan_research.html">Jack L. Wisdom</A> of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology discovered
in 1993 that, for Mars, the tilt can also change abruptly. Excursions of the tilt
axis through a range of as much as 60 degrees may recur sporadically every 10
million years or so. In addition, the orientation of the tilt axis and the shape
of the orbit that Mars follows both change cyclically with time.
<P>These celestial machinations, particularly the tendency of the spin axis to
tilt far over, can cause seasonal temperature extremes. Even with a thin
atmosphere such as the one that exists today, summer temperatures at middle and
high Martian latitudes during periods with large obliquity could have climbed
above freezing for weeks on end, and Martian winters would have been even harsher
than they are currently.
<P>But with sufficient summer warming of one pole, the atmosphere may have
changed drastically. Releases of gas from the warmed polar cap, from seltzer
groundwater or from carbon dioxide- rich permafrost may have thickened the
atmosphere sufficiently to create a temporary greenhouse climate. Water could
then have existed on the surface. Aqueous chemical reactions during such warm
periods would in turn form salts and carbonate rocks. That process would slowly
draw carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, thereby reducing the greenhouse effect.
A return to moderate levels of obliquity might further cool the planet and
precipitate dry-ice snow, thinning the atmosphere even more and returning Mars to
its normal, frigid state.
<P>This theory of climatic change needs to be tested, but new observations and
fresh insights will undoubtedly come from a <A HREF="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/mars/">decade-long series of unpiloted
spacecraft</A> that will next visit Mars. The expeditions begin this month with the
launch of American and Russian probes. This program of exploration had been
slated to conclude in 2005 with the return of Martian rocks. But the discovery of
what may be fossil microbes in an SNC meteorite has sparked thoughts of obtaining
Martian samples sooner so that scientists can better evaluate whether
microorganisms existed on Mars several billion years ago--or even more recently.
<P>The American spacecraft soon to be under way include <I><A HREF="http://mpfwww.jpl.nasa.gov/">Mars Pathfinder</A>
</I>and <I><A HREF="http://mgs-www.jpl.nasa.gov/">Mars Global Surveyor</A>. Pathfinder </I>will land on a bouldery plain of
an outflow channel that once fed an ancient sea. Although not equipped to test
directly for signs of life, this lander will release a <A HREF="http://jpl-352.jpl.nasa.gov/projects/rover/mfex.htm">small roving vehicle</A> to
explore the local environs. <I>Surveyor </I>will take pictures from orbit that
can resolve features that are just a few meters across. Measurements from this
orbiter will also allow scientists to make detailed topographic maps and to
search for icy deposits as well as new evidence of ancient glaciers, lakes and
rivers. Information gathered by <A HREF="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/mip/msurv.html">these next missions</A> should give scientists a
clearer picture of what Mars looked like during its last episode of warmer
climate, perhaps 300 million years in the past.
<P>By <A HREF="http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/devonian/devonian.html">300 million years ago on Earth</A>, amphibians evolved from fish had crawled
out of the sea and inhabited swampy coastlines. Might other complex creatures
have flourished simultaneously along Martian shores? The basic conditions for
life may have existed for a million years late in Martian history--perhaps much
longer during an earlier period. Were these intervals conducive for organisms to
evolve into forms that could survive the dramatic changes in climate? Could
Martian organisms still survive today in underground hot springs? The next decade
of <A HREF="http://cmex-www.arc.nasa.gov/Exo_Strat/exo_strat.html">concentrated exploration</A> may provide the definitive answers, which, if
positive, would mark an intellectual leap as great as any in human history.

<BR>Cars account for half the oil <A HREF="http://www.nrel.gov/documents/energy/transprt.html">consumed in the U.S.</A>, about half the 
<A HREF="http://www.epa.gov/OMSWWW/05-autos.htm">urban pollution</A> and one fourth the 
<A HREF="http://www.bmu.gv.at/enbu/conf1/difiglio.htm">greenhouse gases</A>. They take a similar toll of
resources in other industrial nations and in the cities of the developing world.
As vehicle use continues to increase in the coming decade, the U.S. and other
countries will have to address these issues or else face unacceptable economic,
health-related and political costs. It is unlikely that oil prices will remain at
their current low level or that other nations will accept a large and growing
U.S. contribution to <A HREF="http://bondo.wsc.mass.edu/dept/biology/papers/SMwarm.htm">global climatic change</A>.

<P>Policymakers and industry have four options: reduce vehicle use, increase the
efficiency and reduce the emissions of conventional gasoline-powered vehicles,
switch to less noxious fuels, or find less polluting propulsion systems. The last
of these--in particular the introduction of vehicles powered by electricity--is
ultimately the only sustainable option. The other alternatives are attractive in
theory but in practice are either impractical or offer only marginal
improvements. For example, reduced vehicle use could solve congestion woes and a
host of social and environmental problems, but evidence from around the world
suggests that it is very difficult to make people give up their cars to any
significant extent. In the U.S., mass-transit ridership and carpooling have
declined since World War II. Even in western Europe, with fuel prices averaging
more than $1 a liter (about $4 a gallon) and with pervasive mass transit and
dense populations, cars still account for 80 percent of all passenger travel.

<P>Improved energy efficiency is also appealing, but automotive fuel economy has
barely budged in 10 years.
<A HREF="http://www.nrel.gov/documents/energy/altrfuel.html">Alternative fuels</A> such as
<A HREF="http://afdc2.nrel.gov:70/0/trknews/3-2/trk3-2b.html">methanol</A> or
<A HREF="http://www.nrel.gov/documents/energy/ff-ngas.html">natural gas</A>,
burned in internal-combustion engines, could be introduced at relatively low
cost, but they would lead to only marginal reductions in pollution and <A HREF="http://www.web.apc.org/users/ortee/transportation/report3/">greenhouse
emissions</A> (especially because oil companies are already spending billions of
dollars every year to develop <A HREF="http://www.tnrcc.state.tx.us/air/ms/rfg.htm">less polluting formulations of gasoline</A>).

<P>Electric-drive vehicles (those whose wheels are turned by electric motors
rather than by a mechanical gasoline-powered drivetrain) could reduce urban
pollution and greenhouse emissions significantly over the coming decade. And they
could lay a foundation for a transportation system that would ultimately be
almost pollution-free. Although <A HREF="http://www.pitzer.edu/%7Echris/ev/ev_lecture.html">electrically driven vehicles have a history</A> as
old as that of the internal-combustion engine, a number of recent technological
developments--including by-products of both the computer revolution and the
Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) in the 1980s--promise to make this form of
transportation efficient and inexpensive enough to compete with gasoline.
Overcoming the entrenched advantages of gas-powered cars, however, will require a
concerted effort on the parts of industry and government to make sure that the
environmental benefits accruing from electric cars return to consumers as
concrete incentives for purchase.

<B><A NAME="1">Efficiency Improves</A></B>

<P>The term "electric-drive vehicle" includes not only those cars powered by
batteries charged with household current but also vehicles that generate
electricity onboard or store it in devices other than batteries. Their common
denominator is an efficient electric motor that drives the wheels and extracts
energy from the car's motion when it slows down. Internal-combustion vehicles, in
contrast, employ a constantly running engine whose power is diverted through a
series of gears and clutches to drive the wheels and to turn a generator for the
various electrically powered accessories in the car.

<P>Electric vehicles are more efficient--and thus generally less polluting--than
internal-combustion vehicles for a variety of reasons. First, because the
electric motor is directly connected to the wheels, it consumes no energy while
the car is at rest or coasting, increasing the effective efficiency by roughly
one fifth. Regenerative braking schemes--which employ the motor as a generator
when the car is slowing down--can return as much as half an electric vehicle's
kinetic energy to the storage cells, giving it a major advantage in stop-and-go
urban traffic.

<P>Furthermore, the motor converts more than 90 percent of the energy in its
storage cells to motive force, whereas internal-combustion drives utilize less
than 25 percent of the energy in a liter of gasoline. Although the storage cells
are typically charged by an electricity-generating system, the efficiency of
which averages only 33 percent, an electric drive still has a significant 5
percent net advantage over internal combustion. Innovations such as
combined-cycle generation (which extracts additional energy from the exhaust heat
of a conventional power plant) will soon make it possible for the utility power
plants from which the storage cells are charged to raise their efficiency to as
much as 50 percent. This boost would increase proportionately the fraction of
energy ultimately delivered to the wheels of an electric vehicle. <A HREF="http://www.nrel.gov/documents/electric_vehicles/ev93ch4.html">Fuel cells</A>,
which "burn" <A HREF="http://www.nrel.gov/documents/energy/hydrogen.html">hydrogen</A> to generate electricity directly onboard an electric car
are even more efficient.

<P>Further air-quality benefits derive from electric drives because they shift
the location from which pollutants disperse. Conventional cars emit carbon
monoxide and other pollutants from their tailpipes wherever they travel, whereas
pollution associated with electric power generation is generally located at a few
<A HREF="http://www.nrel.gov/documents/energy/ff-coal.html">coal</A>- or <A HREF="http://www.nrel.gov/documents/energy/ff-oil.html">oil</A>-burning plants at a distance from urban centers.

<P><A HREF="http://www.ott.doe.gov/program/oaat/evs.html">Battery-powered electric vehicles</A> would practically eliminate emissions of
carbon monoxide and volatile unburned hydrocarbons and would greatly diminish
nitrogen oxide emissions. In areas served by dirty coal-fired power plants, they
might marginally increase the emissions of sulfur oxides and particulate matter.
Pollution associated with the modern manufacture of batteries and electric motors
is negligible, however. <A HREF="http://www.hev.doe.gov/">Hybrid vehicles</A> (those combining small
internal-combustion engines with electric motors and electricity storage devices)
will reduce emissions almost as much as battery-powered electric vehicles;
indeed, in regions where most electricity is generated with coal, hybrids may
prove preferable. The impact of electric vehicles on air pollution would be most
beneficial, of course, where electricity is derived from nonpolluting solar,
nuclear, wind or hydroelectric power. Among the chief beneficiaries would be
<A HREF="http://www.energy.ca.gov/energy/cectext/EV_essay.txt">California</A>, where most electricity comes from tightly controlled natural gas
plants and zero-emission hydroelectric and nuclear plants, and France, where most
electricity comes from nuclear power.

<P>These environmental benefits could be very important. Many metropolitan areas
in the U.S. have air significantly more polluted than allowed by health-based
air-quality standards, and most will continue to be in violation of the law in
the year 2000. <A HREF="http://www.edf.org/pubs/NewsReleases/1994/Jun/a_fxc3.html">Pollution in Los Angeles</A> is so severe that even if every vehicle
were to disappear from its streets, the city would have no chance of meeting the
standards. Many other regions in this country have little prospect of meeting
their legal mandates, even with much cleaner-burning gasoline and improved
internal-combustion engines. And elsewhere in the world, in cities such as
Bangkok, Kathmandu and Mexico City, air pollution is more severe than in Los
Angeles.

<P><B><A NAME="2">Energy Storage Is the Key</A></B>

<P><A HREF="http://www.evaa.org/cars/industry.html">Electric vehicles now on the market</A> rely on lead-acid batteries charged from a
standard wall plug. They are unlikely ever to take the market by storm. Not only
are <A HREF="http://suhep.phy.syr.edu/courses/PHY106/Termprojects/Projects/Cars/batypes1.html">lead-acid batteries</A> expensive and bulky, they can drive a car little more
than 150 kilometers between charges. This problem, however, is often overstated.
First, there appears to be a significant market for short-range vehicles; second,
new energy storage devices are even now making the transition from laboratory to
production line.

<P>A regional survey that my colleagues at the University of California at Davis
and I conducted suggests that about half of all households owning more than one
car--the majority of U.S. households, accounting for more than 70 percent of new
car purchases--could easily adapt their driving patterns to make use of a second
car with a range of less than 180 kilometers. Many respondents indicated a
willingness to accept even much shorter ranges. Environmental benefits and the
advantage of home recharging (many people actively dislike refueling at gasoline
stations) compensate for the limited range.

<P><A HREF="http://www.anl.gov/LabDB/Current/Ext/M507.html">Batteries</A> are likely to play a diminishing role in electric vehicles. Among
the replacements now being developed are <A HREF="http://www.llnl.gov/IPandC/opportunities93/09-SENSORS/High_Energy.shtml">ultracapacitors</A>, which store large
amounts of electricity and can charge and discharge quickly; <A HREF="http://www.llnl.gov/IPandC/opportunities93/10-TRANSPORTATION/ElecMechBattery.shtml">flywheels</A>, which
store energy in a spinning rotor; and <A HREF="http://www.ott.doe.gov/program/oaat/FuelCell.html">fuel cells</A>, which convert chemical fuel
into electricity, emitting water vapor.

<P><A HREF="http://www.nrel.gov/documents/electric_vehicles/ev93ch3.html#3.4">Ultracapacitors</A> owe much of their early development to the SDI's
ballistic-missile defense program. Advanced manufacturing techniques can
eliminate the tiny imperfections in a conventional capacitor's insulating film
that allow charge to leak away. New materials make it possible to interleave a
capacitor's carbon and liquid electrolyte much more finely than before. As a
result, ultracapacitors can store about 15 watt-hours (enough energy to run a
one-horsepower motor for about a minute) in a one-liter volume, and a one-liter
device can discharge at a rate of three kilowatts. Ultracapacitors are already
available in small units for calculators, watches and electric razors.

<P>Flywheels first saw use in transportation in the 1950s. Flywheel-powered buses
traveled the streets of Yverdon, Switzerland, revving up their rotors at every
stop. Since then, designs have changed substantially: now composite rotors spin
at up to 100,000 revolutions per second, a speed limited only by the tensile
strength of their rims. Magnetic bearings have reduced friction so that a rotor
can maintain 90 percent of its energy for four days. The first high-powered
ultracapacitors and flywheels are likely to appear in commercial vehicles around
the year 2000. Because they can provide power very rapidly, they will be paired
with batteries--the batteries will supply basic driving needs, and the capacitors
or flywheels will handle peak requirements when the car accelerates or climbs a
hill. This combination will allow the use of smaller battery packs and extend
their service life.

<P>Even the most optimistic projections for <A HREF="http://www.nrel.gov/documents/electric_vehicles/ev93ch3.html">advanced energy storage technologies</A>
still do not compare with the 2,100 kilojoules stored in a 38-liter (10-gallon)
tank of gasoline; for this reason, many researchers have predicted that the most
popular electric-drive vehicles will be hybrids--propelled by electric motors but
ultimately powered by small internal-combustion engines that charge batteries,
capacitors or other power sources. The average power required for highway driving
is only about 10 kilowatts for a typical passenger car, so the engine can be
quite small; the storage cells charge during periods of minimal output and
discharge rapidly for acceleration. Internal-combustion engines can reach
efficiencies as high as 40 percent if operated at a constant speed, and so the
overall efficiency of a hybrid vehicle can be even better than that of a pure
electric drive.

<P>Perhaps the most promising option involves fuel cells. Many researchers see
them as the most likely successor to the internal-combustion engine, and they are
a centerpiece of the ongoing <A HREF="http://www.nttc.edu/env/env_pps.html">Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles</A>, a
collaboration between the federal government and the Big Three automakers. Fuel
cells burn hydrogen to produce water vapor and carbon dioxide, emitting
essentially no other effluents as they generate electricity. (Modified versions
may also use other fuels, including natural gas, methane or gasoline, at a cost
in increased emissions and reduced efficiency.) Although the devices are best
known as power sources for spacecraft, an early fuel cell found its way into an
experimental farm tractor in 1959. Prototype fuel-cell buses built in the
mid-1990s have demonstrated that the technology is workable, but cost is still
the most critical issue. Phosphoric acid-based fuel cells, currently the most
attractive for vehicular use, cost more than $100,000 per kilowatt only a few
years ago but are expected to cost only a few thousand dollars after the turn of
the century and perhaps $100 a kilowatt or less--competitive with the cost of
internal-combustion engines--in full-production volumes. Daimler-Benz announced
in July that it could start selling <A HREF="http://www.daimler-benz.com/spotlite/necar/stufen_e.htm">fuel cell-equipped Mercedes</A> cars as soon as
2006.

<P><B><A NAME="3">Sustainable Transportation</A></B>

<P>Fuel cells will generally be the least polluting of any method for producing
motive power for vehicles. Furthermore, the ideal fuel for fuel cells, from both
a technical and environmental perspective, is hydrogen. Hydrogen can be made from
many different sources, but when fossil fuels become more scarce and expensive,
hydrogen will most likely be made from water using solar cells. If solar hydrogen
were widely adopted, the entire transportation-energy system would be nearly
benign environmentally, and the energy would be fully renewable. The price of
such renewable hydrogen fuel should not exceed even a dollar for the equivalent
of a liter of gasoline.

<P>In addition to the power source, progress in aspects of electric vehicle
technology has accelerated in recent years. A technological revolution--in
electricity storage and conversion devices, electronic controls, software and
materials--is opening up many new opportunities. For example, advances in power
electronics have led to drivetrains that weigh and cost only 40 percent of what
their counterparts did a decade ago. Until the early 1990s, virtually all
electric vehicles depended on direct-current motors because those were easiest to
run from batteries. But the development of small, lightweight inverters (devices
that convert direct current from a battery to the alternating current that is
most efficient for running a motor) makes it possible to abandon DC. AC motors
are more reliable, easier to maintain and more efficient than their DC
counterparts; they are also easier to adapt to regenerative braking. Indeed, the
electric-vehicle motor and power electronics together are now smaller, lighter
and cheaper to manufacture than a comparable internal-combustion engine.

<P>Every major automaker in the world is now investing in electric vehicle
development as well as improvements in less critical technologies such as those
underlying car heaters and tires. The resulting advanced components will be the
building blocks for very clean and efficient vehicles of the future, but in the
meantime many of them are finding their way into internal-combustion vehicles.

<P>Although automakers worldwide have spent perhaps $1 billion on electric
vehicles during the 1990s, in the context of the industry as a whole this
investment is relatively small. The auto industry spends more than $5 billion a
year in the U.S. alone on advertising and more than that on research and
development. And oil companies are spending about $10 billion in the U.S. this
decade just to upgrade refineries to produce reformulated low-emission gasoline.

<P>Much of the investment made so far has been in response to governmental
pressure. In 1990 California adopted a zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) mandate
requiring that major automakers make at least 2 percent of their vehicles
emission-free by 1998, 5 percent by 2001 and 10 percent by 2003. (These
percentages correspond to the production of about 20,000 vehicles a year by
1998.) Failure to meet the quota would lead to a penalty of $5,000 for every ZEV
not available for sale. New York State and Massachusetts enacted similar rules
shortly thereafter.

<P>The major automakers aggressively <A HREF="http://zebu.uoregon.edu/1996/ph162/release.txt">opposed the ZEV mandate</A> but rapidly expanded
their electric-vehicle R&AMPD programs to guard against the possibility that
their regulatory counterattack might fail--and that markets for electric cars
might actually emerge either in the U.S. or abroad. Their loudest complaint was
that the rules forced industry to supply an expensive product without providing
consumers with an incentive to buy them--even though local, state and federal
governments were enacting precisely such incentives.

<P>This past March <A HREF="http://whyfiles.news.wisc.edu/005electcar/">California regulators gave in</A> to pressure from both the
automobile and oil industries and eliminated the quotas for 1998 and 2001,
leaving only a commitment to begin selling electric vehicles and the final goal
for 2003. Industry analysts expect that U.S. sales will be no more than 5,000
vehicles a year until after the turn of the century.

<P>One crucial factor in determining the success of electric vehicles is their
price--a figure that is still highly uncertain. General Motors's newly introduced
<A HREF="http://www.gmev.com/EVmainpage.html">EV1</A> is nominally priced at $33,000; <A HREF="http://www.solectria.com/">Solectria</A> sells its low-volume-production
electric vehicles for between $30,000 and $75,000, depending on the battery
configuration. (Nickel-metal hydride batteries capable of carrying the car more
than 320 kilometers add nearly $40,000 to the price of a lead-battery vehicle.)
The adversarial nature of the regulatory process has encouraged opponents and
proponents to make unrealistically high or low estimates, so it will be
impossible to tell just how much the vehicles will cost until they are in mass
production. Comparisons with the price history of other products, including
conventional automobiles, however, suggest that full-scale production could
reduce prices to significantly less than half their present level.

<P><FONT SIZE="-1"><B>ECONOMIES OF SCALE</B> should enable manufacturers to reduce the prices of
electric vehicles once production volumes increase beyond their current level of
a few vehicles a day. Eventually the cost of materials will dominate the total
cost of electric vehicles. (These estimates are derived from experience with
conventional vehicle manufacturing, in which a typical factory produces 100,000
or more vehicles a year.)</FONT>

<P><B><A NAME="4">An Uncertain Road</A></B>

<P>Faced with the inevitability of electric vehicle production, automakers are
devising <A HREF="http://lcs.usatoday.com/money/consumer/autos/mauto110.htm">strategies to produce them inexpensively</A>.
Many (including <A HREF="http://www.peugeot.com/en2nd.html">Peugeot</A> in
Europe) are simply removing engines, gas tanks and transmissions from the bodies
of existing gasoline vehicles and inserting batteries, controllers and electric
motors with minimal modification. Others, including <A HREF="http://www.ford.com/corporate-info/environment/index.html">Ford</A>, are selling "gliders"
(car bodies with no installed drive components) to smaller conversion companies
that then fit them with an electric drive. A third strategy is to build very
small vehicles, such as the <A HREF="http://www.swatch-art.com/swatch/swcar.htm">Mercedes Smart</A>--known popularly as the
Swatchmobile--targeted at the emerging market niche for limited-range urban
vehicles. Of all the major manufacturers, only <A HREF="http://www.gm.com/cgi-bin/new-road/new-road.cgi">General Motors</A> has thus far
committed to mass production of an <A HREF="http://www.saturncars.com/EV1/">ordinary car</A> designed from the ground up for
electric drive.

<P>The cost of batteries (and fuel cells) will probably always render electric
vehicles more expensive to purchase than comparable gasoline vehicles. On a
per-kilometer basis, however, the cost of an electric and internal-combustion
vehicle should eventually be about the same. Fuel for electric vehicles is
inexpensive, maintenance is minimal, and it appears that electric motors last
significantly longer than gasoline engines. Taking into account the cost of air
pollution, greenhouse gases and other market externalities (that is, factors that
society at large must now pay for) would tip the scale in favor of electric
vehicles in many circumstances.

<P>The challenge for policymakers and marketers is to assure that consumers take
into account these full costs, a goal that has thus far been difficult to pursue.
In California, where powerful air-quality regulators have led the way toward
electric vehicles, progress has been slowed by opposition from both auto
manufacturers and oil companies. On a national level, early hopes for the
Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles <A HREF="http://www.nas.edu/onpi/pr/mar96/pngv2.html">have foundered</A> on inadequate
funding, political infighting and excessive caution. As a result of this internal
conflict, vehicles to be built in 2004 will ostensibly have their designs set in
1997, making it likely that the partnership will embrace only the smallest of
incremental improvements rather than spearheading the introduction of fuel cells
and other radically new technologies.

<P>Nevertheless, it seems certain that electric-drive technology will eventually
supplant internal-combustion engines--perhaps not quickly, uniformly nor
entirely--but inevitably. The question is when, in what form and how to manage
the transition. Perhaps the most important lesson learned from the current state
of affairs is that government should do what it does best: provide broad market
incentives that bring external costs such as pollution back into the economic
calculations of consumers and corporations, and target money at innovative,
leading-edge technologies rather than fund work that private companies would be
doing in any case.

<P>The emergence of electric vehicles has important economic implications.
Whoever pioneers the commercialization of cost-competitive electric vehicle
technologies will find inviting export markets around the world. Electric
vehicles will be attractive where pollution is severe and intractable, peak
vehicle performance is less highly valued than reliability and low maintenance,
cheap electricity is available off-peak, and investments in oil distribution are
small. Indeed, if the U.S. and other major industrial nations do not act, it is
quite possible that the next generation of corporate automotive giants may arise
in developing countries, where cars are relatively scarce today.

<B>SPACE STATION UNDER SCRUTINY</B>

<P>In the article on the International Space Station ["Science in the Sky,"
June], Tim Beardsley and the editors at <I>Scientific American</I> would
have done well to resist the temptation to play the "my research is more
important (read: worthy of funding) than yours" game. Congressional
science funding is not a zero-sum game in which killing one program
results in a windfall for another. Our fortunes rise and fall together.

<P><I>James F. Buchli 
<BR>Boeing Defense &AMP; Space Group 
<BR>Houston, Tex. </I>
<BR>Buchli is a former shuttle astronaut.

<P><HR>The current cyberspace generation is attuned to more abstract forms
of exploration than following the doings of a few humans on the space
station. Hyperlinks to Martian landscapes or images of extrasolar
planets generated by sensors on telescopes, probes or rovers seem a lot
more compelling than experiments detailing long-term human performance
in space. I suspect citizens of the next century will vote with their
browsers to fund the unmanned designs Daniel S. Goldin has commissioned.

<P><I>Tomas Valis 
<BR>Toronto, Ontario</I>

<P><HR>I read with concern Beardsley's article because it presented a
one-sided perspective of the economics of space station science and
technology. For example, his comments on the Space Vacuum Epitaxy Center
imply a futility in our efforts to utilize the space station that is
simply unfounded. Beardsley writes that "no facility for orbital
molecular-beam epitaxy could operate within 50 miles of the space
station," yet we have successfully operated the Wake Shield Facility for
molecular-beam epitaxy as close as 15 miles from the space shuttle.

<P>He also indicates incorrectly that we have "not persuaded any
business to fund epitaxy research in space" and that the Centers for the
Commercial Development of Space (CCDS) "are being bankrolled by NASA."
Epitaxy research at the Space Vacuum Epitaxy Research Center has
received funds from industry of more than $2.3 million over the past
seven years. And in the 1994 fiscal year, other funding going to the
CCDS totaled more than $48 million, compared with the $18.6 million
allocated by NASA--a far cry from "bankrolling."

<P><I>Alex Ignatiev 
<BR>Director, Space Vacuum Epitaxy Center
<BR>University of Houston</I>

<P><HR><B>Beardsley replies:</B>

<P>The assessment that no manufacturing facility for molecular-beam
epitaxy could operate within 50 miles of the space station was offered
to me by a technical staff member of the Space Vacuum Epitaxy Center.
The staff member explained that experiments 15 miles from the shuttle
have failed to produce epitaxial material suitable for manufacturing and
that semiconductor companies have so far declined to initiate
substantial space epitaxy development efforts. This source also stated
that industry has restricted itself mainly to contributions of materials
and staff time.

<P>Regarding the subsidy that NASA provides to the CCDS, a National
Research Council report recently described the arrangement as
"fundamentally flawed" and recommended auctioning commercial facilities
on the space station to the highest bidder. The subsidy from NASA--and
government funds for science projects in general--are valid topics for
public debate and should not be left unexamined for fear that all
research grants might evaporate under scrutiny.

<P><HR><B>OLYMPIC GOLD</B>

<P>Just one look at the fancy bicycle featured on the cover of your June
issue and pictured in Jay T. Kearney's article, "Training the Olympic
Athlete," indicates just how unsuccessful regulation to encourage pure
athletic performance over technological (and financial) prowess has
been. International cycling rules specify that "bicycles shall be of the
type that is or could be purchased by anyone practicing cycling as a
sport." But this "anyone" should be prepared to spend at least $20,000
if he or she wants a Superbike II.

<P><HR><B>DAMAGE ASSESSMENT</B>

<P><I>"Confronting the Nuclear Legacy: Ten Years of the Chornobyl Era," by
Yuri M. Shcherbak [April], prompted considerable mail from readers
questioning the author's assessment of the number of casualties caused
by the Chornobyl nuclear power plant explosion. The commentary that
follows is adapted from an article that first appeared in </I>Swiat
Nauki, <I>the Polish edition of </I>Scientific American.

<P>Ambassador Shcherbak's article is one of many recent publications
presenting the Chornobyl catastrophe in black colors. The paper has
clear antitechnology motivations, describing the Chornobyl accident as
an example of an "ever growing threat of technology run amok." I do not
wish to correct all the errors and distortions in Shcherbak's paper, but
I will rather present the number of injuries and deaths as a result of
the accident as estimated by the international community of radiation
protection experts. I will base my comments on reports of the United
Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation
(UNSCEAR)--the most distinguished international scientific body on the
matters of ionizing radiation--as well as a recent report from the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the
proceedings of Chornobyl symposiums held recently.

<P>An assessment of the impact on human health caused by the meltdown at
Chornobyl should be limited to the effects of ionizing radiation and
heat, as well as mechanical injuries, excluding losses caused by
psychological factors such as hysteria. (Symptoms of psychosomatic
origin resulted from the stress of the evacuation of hundreds of
thousands of people, leading to disruption of community, family networks
and traditional ways of life.) During the first few hours of the
catastrophe, 237 people--employees of the nuclear power station and
rescue workers--were irradiated with doses of radiation ranging from
2,000 to 16,000 millisieverts. For comparison, the global average of
natural lifetime radiation exposure is 168 millisieverts, although in
some countries the average dose is much higher. For example, in some
districts of Norway, the lifetime dose is 1,500 millisieverts, in India,
2,000 millisieverts and in Iran, 3,000 millisieverts. The 237 people at
Chornobyl were hospitalized with suspected acute radiation sickness
(ARS). Doctors confirmed this diagnosis in 134 cases.

<P>During the first three months after the accident, 28 patients died of
ARS. Another two died from mechanical or thermal injuries, and one
person died from coronary thrombosis. Over the past 10 years, out of the
original 134 people diagnosed with ARS, 14 died, but probably because of
other causes. And among the general public, three children died of
thyroid cancer related to exposure to radioactive iodine released during
the accident. Thus, the total number of people who died from radiation
or injuries stemming from the heat or the explosion stands at 48.

<P>Between 1986 and 1989 the 270,000 residents of the contaminated areas
near Chornobyl received radiation dosages ranging from five to about 250
millisieverts, with the average dose falling at approximately 40
millisieverts. Among the 135,000 people evacuated in the first few weeks
after the event, the average exposure was 15 millisieverts. The 800,000
"liquidators" (who buried the most dangerous wastes and constructed the
building now surrounding the reactor) received on average 170
millisieverts in 1986 and 15 millisieverts in 1989. A small number of
these people received more than the emergency dose limit, which was set
at 250 millisieverts. How dangerous were these levels? Among residents
of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, malignant tumors were not observed in people
who received radiation doses to the whole body of less than 200
millisieverts. Furthermore, mortality from leukemia in these cities was
lower among people who were exposed to fewer than 100 millisieverts than
in nonexposed people. Thus, many experts did not expect an increase in
cancer rates after Chornobyl, and subsequent studies carried out by
teams in Ukraine, Belarus and Russia confirmed this prediction. In
regions contaminated with Chornobyl debris, the rising cancer rate is
identical to the increase observed in other regions of Ukraine and can
be explained by the growing elderly population.

<P>Irradiation of thyroid glands in children is a different story.
Because high doses of radioactive iodine can become concentrated in the
small mass of the gland, researchers expected a significant increase in
the rate of thyroid cancer six to eight years after the catastrophe;
instead the increase showed up after only four years. But whether the
increase was the result exclusively of radiation from Chornobyl or of
other agents as well is still a matter of discussion. In any event,
until the end of 1995, a total of 682 children with thyroid cancer had
been identified in Ukraine, Belarus and Russia. As previously noted,
three of these patients died.

<P>Economic losses in Belarus alone are expected to reach $55 billion in
1995, soaring to $190 billion by 2010. Most of these expenses--$86
billion--will be spent on pensions, rents and other compensations for
millions of people who will receive doses of radiation lower than the
natural levels present in many regions of the world. In terms of
economic devastation, the accident at Chornobyl qualifies as an enormous
industrial catastrophe. But in terms of human fatalities, it cannot be
regarded as a major one. After 10 years, fatalities total 48, a number
that pales in comparison to fatalities from other industrial
accidents--the 6,954 who died in the 10 years after the chemical
accident in Bhopal, India, to name just one example.

<P><I>Zbigniew Jaworowski 
<BR>Central Laboratory for Radiological Protection 
<BR>Warsaw, Poland</I>

<P><HR><B>Shcherbak replies:</B>

<P>In my numerous meetings with people who, like Jaworowski, call
themselves the "international community of radiation protection
experts," I could not but be surprised by their open cynicism. From the
very beginning, they denied any tragic consequences of the catastrophe
and hid information about radiation levels in certain areas. These
people did not want to notice the growth in children's thyroid cancer
and, following the mendacious Communist regime propaganda, proclaimed
those who physically and mentally suffered from the disaster as
experiencing hysteria.

<P>Dozens of highly qualified experts from the former U.S.S.R.--medical
doctors, radiobiologists, geneticists, nuclear physicists and
others--have convincingly shown that the disaster at Chornobyl had an
unprecedented and ominous character. I never belonged to the
"catastrophists" who thought that Chornobyl would cause millions of
deaths. As any unbiased reader could see, I was very cautious with
figures in my article, avoiding ungrounded conclusions and using only
verified data. But at the same time, I consider it absolutely immoral to
ignore the medical importance of this event.

<P>Finally, I have a proposal for Jaworowski: if he believes the
Chornobyl catastrophe "cannot be regarded as a major one," I could ask
Ukrainian officials to find a nice-looking home within the area
contaminated by strontium, cesium and plutonium where he could settle
down with his family. There he could demonstrate that one need not
describe the Chornobyl disaster in black colors but in rosy ones.

<BR><B>OCTOBER 1946</B>

<P>"Fuel costs are such a relatively small figure in the overall expense
of generating electricity that atomic power plants would reduce
residential electric bills only slightly, according to a recent
Westinghouse estimate. The investment required for central generating
stations and distribution stations, and equipment maintenance, far
outweighs the fuel bill."

<P>"Some unusual set-ups are being used to give an accelerated but
accurate measure of the way materials perform as parts of an entire
unit. A refrigerator door, for example, may have a fine appearance and
work well for a few times, but this is no assurance that it will
function satisfactorily over a period of years. Therefore, in place of
waiting for a housewife to open and close the refrigerator door to
death, a machine was made which performs that operation
continually--verging on the slamming side for good measure--24 hours a
day to failure. An equivalent door life of 15 years is compressed to
about 12 days by the robot door-slammer."

<P>"'Teacher, I can't see the board' used to be a familiar cry at the
Bowditch School in Salem, Massachusetts, before the establishment of
Room 4 as an experiment in schoolroom lighting. Keys to better seeing
include triangular fluorescent luminaires that produce an asymmetric
light distribution, with the greatest illumination facing the
blackboard, and when louvers on windows can not adequately control sky
glare, the fluorescent lamps are switched on or off by a 'monitor' pupil
according to the indications of a simplified light meter fastened to his
desk."

<P><HR><B>OCTOBER 1896</B>

<P>"Cycling, which was yesterday the fad of the few, is today the pastime
of the many. Unfortunately, this progress has been attended with
numberless casualties. One temptation to many cyclists is to see how
speedily they can sacrifice their lives on hilly ground. The moment the
brow of a hill is reached the reckless cyclist seems impelled to take
his feet from the pedals and to allow the machine to descend with all
the rapidity which gravity gives it. A good brake affixed to the back
wheel would considerably reduce the number of accidents from this cause;
but, unfortunately, there is an idea that a brake adds an inconvenient
weight to the machine."

<P>"Leydenia gemmipara Schaudinn is the name given to a parasitic
amoeboid rhizopod which Berlin professors have recently found in the
fluid taken from patients suffering from cancer of the stomach, and
which they think may possibly be the cause of the disease."

<P>"A new variety of window glass invented by Richard Szigmondy, of
Vienna, has the peculiar virtue of non-conductivity for heat rays. A
pane of this glass a quarter inch thick absorbs 87 to 100 per cent of
the heat striking it, in contrast to plate glass, which absorbs only
about 5 per cent. If Szigmondy's glass is opaque to heat rays, it will
keep a house cool in summer, but tend to make it warmer in winter."

<P><HR><B>OCTOBER 1846</B>

<P>"Animal magnetism, with all its boasted advantages in rendering people
insensible to pain, appears likely to be superseded by a discovery of
Dr. William T. G. Morton, of Boston. It is no other than a gas or vapor,
by the inhaling of a small quantity of which, the patient becomes
immediately unconscious, and insensible to pain, thus giving an
opportunity for the most difficult and otherwise painful surgical
operations, without inconvenience."

<P>"Jean-Baptiste Fourier, a French philosopher, established that there
are three states in which material bodies exist and proved that when a
solid body or a liquid (such as molten iron) becomes incandescent, the
light which it emits is polarized; and that the light of incandescent
gases, such as flame, is unpolarized. Now M. Franois Arago has, with
most beautiful sagacity, established that the light from the sun is not
polarized; the conclusion is inevitable, that the surface of the sun is
covered by an atmosphere of flame." [<I>Editors' note: Plasma, the
fourth state of matter, was not recognized until 1952. The surface of
the sun does give off unpolarized light but is actually composed of
plasma.</I>]

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">INVENTOR CHESTER F. CARLSON  re-creates the experiment that marked the advent of
xerography. The original machine never worked well, but it provided the
technological prototype for today's photocopiers.
</FONT>

<P>The term "xerography," the use of photoelectric phenomena to transfer
an image from one sheet of paper to another, comes from the Greek words
for "dry" and "writing." Chester F. Carlson, a New York City patent
attorney who had studied chemistry at the California Institute of
Technology, first demonstrated this technique 58 years ago in a
makeshift laboratory above a bar in Astoria, Queens, N.Y.

<P>Over the next six years, more than 20 companies turned down Carlson's
proposals to develop the technology. In 1944 Battelle Memorial
Institute, a nonprofit research organization, entered into a
royalty-sharing arrangement with Carlson. Battelle eventually signed a
development contract in 1947 with Haloid Company, a Rochester, N.Y.,
firm that produced photographic paper and later became Xerox
Corporation. The first xerographic machine came onto the market in 1949,
but it was slow, dirty and hard to use. Not until 1959 did Xerox
introduce an office copier, the 914, which became the basis for the
current multibillion-dollar industry.

<P>PHOTOCOPIER moves a document from the handler to the glass platen
(<I>not shown</I>), where the pattern of the image is projected by
lamps, mirrors and lenses onto a photoreceptor belt (or drum). The
electrostatic charge on the belt fades in areas receiving light from the
projected image. Magnetic rollers brush the belt with dry ink (toner),
which because of its static charge clings to the image area on the belt.
A sheet of copy paper approaching the belt is also given a static charge
sufficiently strong to draw the image pattern in the toner away from the
belt. Rollers then apply heat and pressure to fuse the toner image into
place. For color copying, a multistep process is used, which scans the
image through color filters and then applies separate toners for
magenta, cyan, yellow and black.</FONT>

<P>DRY COPYING exploits the principles that materials with opposite
electrical charges attract one another and that some materials conduct
electricity better after exposure to light. In the basic xerography
process, a photoconductive surface receives a positive electrical charge
(<I>a</I>). An image is then exposed on the surface; because the
illuminated sections (the nonimage areas) become more conductive, their
charge dissipates (<I>b</I>). Negatively charged powder spread over the
surface adheres through electrostatic attraction to the positively
charged image area (<I>c</I>). A piece of paper is then given a positive
charge (<I>d</I>) and placed over the surface, where it attracts the
negatively charged powder (<I>e</I>). Finally, heat fuses the image as
etched in powder to the paper (<I>f</I>).</FONT>

The controversy over Martian life <BR>is just beginning</center>

<P>Martian animal, vegetable or mineral?
</TD>
<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=336>
<BR>NEW HINT OF LIFE IN SPACE IS FOUND: Meteorites Yield Fossilized,
One-Cell Organisms Unlike Any Known on the Earth," shouted a headline in
the <I>New York Times. </I>"Something Out There," <I>Newsweek</I> chimed
in. Respected scientists told crowds of reporters that their work,
published in a prestigious journal, revealed complex hydrocarbons and
what looked like fossilized bacteria buried deep within a meteorite.
This, they claimed, was "the first physical evidence for the existence
of forms of life beyond our planet."

<P>That was 1961, and the meteorite in question was not the one from
Mars that has made recent headlines but another that had fallen a
century earlier in Orgueil, France. Under closer scrutiny, the
astonishing evidence was eventually thrown out of the court of
scientific opinion. The organic chemicals and "fossils" turned out to be
ragweed pollen and furnace ash.

<P>So it is with understandable skepticism that scientists are greeting
the bold assertions, made by David S. McKay of the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration Johnson Space Center and eight colleagues, that
the peculiar features they found in meteorite ALH84001 are best
explained by the existence of primitive life on early Mars. Despite
public enthusiasm about the conclusions, published in <I>Science,</I>
many leading researchers who study meteorites and ancient life have
weighed the evidence and found it unconvincing. "There are nonbiological
interpretations of McKay's data that are much more likely," concludes
Derek Sears, editor of the journal <I>Meteoritics and Planetary
Science</I>.

<P>On August 7 the nightly news recounted ALH84001's impressive rsum:
born 4.5 billion years ago in Mars's depths; splashed by a huge impact
into interplanetary space to drift for 16 million years; captured in
Earth's gravity and dragged  into Antarctic snow; buried in ice for 10
to 20 millennia until 1984, when meteorite hunters picked it up and made
it famous. That much nearly everyone agrees on; the controversy centers
on the rock's less glamorous inside story.

<P>McKay and his collaborators build the case for life on four lines of
evidence. The first are blobs, no bigger than periods, that dot the
walls of the cracks and crevices perforating the meteorite's shiny
crust. These multilayered formations, called carbonate rosettes, tend to
have cores rich in manganese, surrounded by a layer of iron carbonate
and then by an iron sulfide rind. Bacteria in ponds can produce similar
rosettes as they metabolize minerals. But "that is a perfectly
reasonable sequence to find in a changing chemical environment as well,"
counters Kenneth H. Nealson, a biologist at the University of Wisconsin.

<P>The second line of evidence centers on the discovery of organic
compounds called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, or PAHs, in and
around the carbonate. Richard N. Zare, a Stanford University chemist and
co-author of the <I>Science</I> paper, reports that the rock contains an
unusual mixture of certain lightweight PAHs. "In conjunction with all
the other data, it seems most likely to me that they all came from the
breakdown products of something that was once alive," he says.

<P>Critics suggest other possible explanations, however. "Hydrothermal
synthesis could take inorganic carbon and water and make aromatic
organics; you would get the same ones they report," points out Bernd
Simoneit, a chemist at Oregon State University. "And look at the
Murchison meteorite, thought to come from the asteroid belt," adds
Everett Shock of Washington University. "Hundreds of organic compounds
have been identified in it, including amino acids and compounds closer
to the things organisms actually use. It has carbonate minerals in it,
too--and real solid evidence of water--yet there isn't anybody saying
that there is life in the asteroid belt."

<P>Training high-power electron microscopes on ALH84001, McKay's group
found its third and most cogent bit of evidence: tiny, teardrop-shaped
crystals of magnetite and iron sulfide are embedded in places where the
carbonate is dissolved, presumably by some sort of acid. The authors
note that certain bacteria manufacture broadly similar magnetite and
iron sulfide crystals. Joseph Kirschvink, a biomineralogist at the
California Institute of Technology, agrees that the mineral formations
are intriguing. "If it is not biology, I am at a loss to explain what
the hell is going on," he says. "I don't know of anything else that can
make crystals like that." Shock remains unconvinced. "There are other
ways to get those shapes. And in any case," he continues, "shape is one
of the worst things you can use in geology to define things."

<P>The final thread of evidence has drawn the sharpest attacks.
Examining bits of ALH84001 under an electron microscope, McKay's team
found elongated and egg-shaped structures within the carbonate; the
researchers interpreted these as fossilized nanoorganisms. Many
scientists are unconvinced that such organisms ever existed on Earth,
let alone elsewhere. There is also a real danger of an observer effect
at work. "The problem," says NASA exobiologist Jack Farmer, "is that at
that scale of just tens of nanometers, minerals can grow into shapes
that are virtually impossible to distinguish from nanofossils." But
Everett K. Gibson, Jr., another of McKay's co-authors, responds that "we
eliminated that possibility for most of our examples by noting the lack
of crystal growth faces" and other mineralogical features.

<P>Some critics also find the small size of the "fossils" hard to square
with the other evidence. "These structures contain one one-thousandth
the volume of the smallest terrestrial bacteria," points out Carl R.
Woese of the University of Illinois, who studies the chemistry of
ancient life. "They really press the lower limit," he says, of how tiny
a living unit can be. Moreover, the putative Martian bacteria are hardly
larger than the mineral crystals they are supposed to have produced.

<P>If not life, then what can account for this odd collection of
features? One possibility is a hydrothermal process. "Imagine hot fluids
flowing through the crust," suggests John F. Kerridge of the University
of California at San Diego. "The crystallization of magnetite, iron
sulfides and carbonate with a change in the chemistry over time is
perfectly reasonable. If anywhere in the subsurface of Mars there are
PAHs, then they would be carried by this fluid and deposited where the
fluids crystallize. I think the nanostructures are most likely an
unusual surface texture resulting from the way in which the carbonate
crystallized."

<P>Then there is the specter of contamination. Jeffrey Bada of the
Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, Calif., notes that PAHs
have been found in glacial ice, albeit at very low concentrations; when
he analyzed a different Martian meteorite, he found that terrestrial
amino acids had worked their way into the rock. McKay and his colleagues
tried to avoid being fooled by contaminants by running the same tests on
several Antarctic meteorites. They showed, among other things, that
nothing was living inside ALH84001 at the time it was analyzed, that
most (but not all) of the carbonates harbored isotopes associated with
Mars and that PAHs were more concentrated inside the rock than on its
surface. "These arguments are flaky and simplistic," Sears rebuts.
"Weathering is a sloppy process. Things leach in, then leach out; they
do not do the obvious."

<P>The search for better answers is already under way. Researchers in
many disciplines are scrambling to obtain pieces of ALH84001 and the 11
other meteorites identified as Martian. Zare says he wants to search for
amino acids and to compare the carbon 13 in the PAHs with that of
Mars--work that some feel he should have done before going public with
his results. McKay has talked about obtaining electron micrographs of
thin sections of the nanofossils, but such efforts will push the limits
of present technology.

<P>If the results hold up, some suspect it may be just the tip of the
iceberg. "My impression is that bacterial life exists on planets around
one in 10 stars, maybe more," speculates Stanley Miller of U.C.S.D. "I
would view life on Mars not as a surprise but as a new frontier."

ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY

<center><H2>FISH FIGHT</H2>

A struggle over resources <BR>in Indian waters comes to a boil</center>

<P>On August 7, Thomas Kocherry of the National Fishworkers' Forum (NFF)
in India began an indefinite hunger strike; three days later fisherfolk
around the nation followed with a blockade of harbors. The protesters
were demanding the revocation of licenses granted to foreign vessels for
fishing within the Indian maritime zone. The enormous capacity of these
ships, they claimed, threatened the livelihood of more than eight
million traditional fishermen.

<P>This skirmish is only the latest in a decades-long war between the
government and the fishermen of India. In 1970 the Ministry of Food
Processing Industries subsidized the purchase of 180 high-tech trawlers
to exploit waters deeper than 50 meters. These vessels dragged weighted,
fine-mesh nets across the seafloor in search of shrimp, collecting
entire ecosystems. The ravaged seabed lost its ability to nurture fish,
and at least 350,000 tons of nontarget species, or "trash fish," were
tossed out annually. By 1990 the shrimp grounds were overfished and most
of the trawlers idle. Although the richer inshore waters were reserved
for small boats, Harekrishna K. Debnath of the NFF asserts that the
trawlers routinely encroached within 50 meters. The traditional sector
saw its catch drop precipitously.

<P>In 1991, when a wind of liberalization blew across India, the
ministry invited the owners of foreign fleets to team up with Indian
partners in joint ventures. Noting that the total catch in 1989 was 2.2
million tons, whereas the projected yield was 3.9 million tons, the
officials argued there was room for new fishing technology. A 1992
report by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) stated, however,
that most of the unharvested fish were noncommercial species, so that
only 164,000 additional tons could be profitably caught. According to
the NFF, 194 joint-venture licenses have been granted, many of them to
trawlers. (The ministry did not respond to <I>Scientific American</I>'s
requests for information.) The vessels are exempt from customs, sales
and excise taxes, are allowed up to 95 percent foreign equity, and
export 80 percent of their catch.

<P>As before, the foreign vessels are instructed to stay in deep waters,
but Debnath alleges that they do not. "The government says it is
transfer of technology. But it is a transfer of crisis from their place
to ours," he attests, referring to the overfishing of northern waters.
In 1995 the government convened an expert committee to study the
situation. By February the committee had handed down its
recommendation--cancellation of all joint-venture licenses.

<P>The actual damage done by the foreign ships is debatable. Sebastian
Mathew of the International Collective in Support of Fishworkers points
out that no more than 34 vessels have been sighted in Indian waters.
Snelling R. Brainard of Consolidated Seafood Corporation in Boston,
which holds licenses for 75 long-liners, explains that his fleet targets
big-eye tuna in international waters off the southern coast. One major
concern of the NFF is that the licensing of some foreign vessels makes
it harder for the Indian coast guard to identify unlicensed ones.
Purwito Martosubroto of the FAO concurs that the weakness of fishery
surveillance systems in South Asia leaves room for poaching.

<P>But also in dispute are the economics of the joint ventures. Each
license costs a maximum of $700, amounting to no more than $136,000 in
revenues from licensing fees. In contrast, the Seychelles islands earned
$6.7 million in licensing fees in 1989, from 55 foreign vessels fishing
in its waters. Because the foreign vessels can transfer their catch in
mid-sea, there are no independent estimates of its value. The government
claims, however, earnings of $11 million in annual royalties; in
addition, unspecified amounts are remitted to the Indian partners. These
partners, Debnath argues, help explain the policy: they reportedly
include some very well-connected individuals. Intriguingly, the Indian
partners for 125 out of 159 joint-venture vessels registered in 1994
were located in New Delhi--a landlocked city that is the seat of
political patronage in the nation.

<P>The class wars are exacerbated by one other aspect of industrial
fishing. The by-catch from the foreign trawlers and liners is nowadays
ground up to feed farmed shrimp, poultry or pigs--for consumption in the
developed world. These trash fish used to be a primary source of protein
for poor Indians. But because fishermen bring home less of the no-name
fish, prices have increased fivefold in the past decade, putting this
essential food out of reach of the poor.

<P>At the root of all this trouble is the lack of a coherent policy for
managing the fisheries. Although the Ministry of Food Processing
Industries has issued the licenses, the Commerce Ministry is responsible
for promoting marine products--and fisheries as a whole are run by the
Agriculture Ministry. The government's figures are not credible to
fishermen: Mathew contends that in 1990, after the protests first
gathered strength, the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute
changed sampling techniques to come up with an unprecedentedly high
catch in the state of Kerala. "One of the greatest contributions of the
movement," he states, "is that it exposes the mess."

I step out of my rental vehicle and get a lungful of the end product of
bovine digestion. There are flies buzzing around and cattle as far as
the eye can see, which is very, very far on the flat Texas Panhandle.
I'm about 20 kilometers southwest of Amarillo, in the Randall County
Feedyard, surrounded by about 60,000 cattle. There are Black Anguses,
Brahmins, Limousines, Herefords, Charolais, Simmentals, Holsteins and
countless intermixtures. Pretty soon, they'll all be steaks. But besides
meat, the carcasses of these animals will yield a wealth of data perhaps
only a cattle breeder could love.

<P>Such information is the stock-in-trade of Theodore H. (Ted)
Montgomery, who directs the Beef Carcass Research Center at nearby West
Texas A&AMPM University, as well as the associated Cattlemen's Carcass
Data Service, a unit of the <A HREF="http://ncanet.org/profile/ncba.html">National Cattlemen's Beef Association</A>.
Montgomery is an ample, affable, plainspoken man, notwithstanding his
Ph.D. and other credentials. (His first words to me are "You look like a
Yankee from New York City.")

<P>Montgomery notes that rigorous data collection already enables those
who raise chickens and pigs to exert considerable control over the
efficiency and consistency of meat production by tinkering with
breeding, feeding and veterinary treatments. Beef cattle, however, lead
a less sheltered and controlled existence, with several different owners
over their (typically) 14- to 24-month lifetime. Such factors work
against consistency--making one sirloin tender and another tough, even
in the same supermarket on the same day.

<P>Data collection can begin with the birth of a calf, when cowhands
give the animal an ear tag and note the animal's sex, parentage,
birthweight and any difficulties with the birth. Later, they record the
weaning weight--how big the calf is when it stops nursing--which is a
good indicator of how efficiently the animal converts food to edible
tissue. Information is also collected on inoculations and illnesses.
(The cattle industry being somewhat behind the technological vanguard,
the information may be scribbled on a piece of feed sack before making
its way to the computer.) The data could be useful in tracing any major
maladies--such as the "mad cow" disease that has affected British cattle
recently.

<P>The "bottom-line" data, as Montgomery calls them, are recorded after
the animal is slaughtered. They are used to compute the yield grade and
the quality grade; the former comes from measurements of the carcass
weight, the rib-eye area and the fat inside the body cavity. Those
figures are fed into an equation that estimates the percentage of
boneless primals--round, loin, rib and chuck--which tells the breeder
which animals produced the highest percentage by weight of lean meat. A
grade of one means that at least 52.3 percent of the animal's carcass
weight became trimmed steaks and roasts; five means that less than 45.4
percent did. The quality grade is a more subjective measure of the
meat's color, texture, intramuscular fat ("marbling") and the age of the
animal's skeleton.

<P>So far Montgomery's group collects such statistics on only one tenth
of 1 percent of the 25 million or so "fed cattle" in the U.S. His
long-term goal is to provide data to enough cattle breeders, feeders and
others to make more of the steaks purchased in supermarkets and
restaurants consistent, especially in tenderness and marbling. In the
meantime, as a reality check, he fondly harbors a secret plan: to
consume and compare 10 steaks (not all on the same day, of course) from
each of several restaurants. One presumes that martinis might be
necessary to make the experiments as realistic as possible. What some
people won't do in the name of science.

GEOPHYSICS

<center><H2>A SPINNING CRYSTAL BALL</H2>

Seismologists discover <BR>that the inner core rotates</center>

<P>Researchers are now probing what may turn out to be the most curious
small body the solar system has yet presented for scrutiny: a globe the
size of the moon that appears to be a well-ordered crystalline entity.
This body is poised little more than 5,000 kilometers away, yet it is
completely invisible. Located at the center of the earth, it is known
simply as the inner core. Two seismologists have just shown that this
strange crystal sphere is turning slowly within the rocky and liquid
metal enclosure that keeps it all but hidden from scientific
investigation.

<P>Geophysicists realized decades ago that a solid inner core exists,
but they knew precious little else about it. They believed the inner
core and the liquid shell surrounding it were made largely of iron, yet
other features of the heart of the planet remained enigmatic.

<P>But during the 1980s, seismologists examining earthquake waves that
pierce the inner core made a startling find. Rather than being
"isotropic" (the same in all directions) in its physical properties, the
inner core proved to be somewhat like a piece of wood, with a definite
grain running through it. Waves traveling along the planet's north-south
axis go 3 to 4 percent faster through the inner core than those that
follow paths close to the equatorial plane.

<P>Geophysicists have struggled to explain why this grain (or "seismic
anisotropy") should exist. The leading theory is that at the immense
pressures of the inner core, iron takes on a hexagonal crystal form that
has inherently directional physical properties. Some force apparently
keeps the hexagonal iron crystals all in close alignment.

<P>Lars Stixrude of the Georgia Institute of Technology and Ronald E.
Cohen of the Carnegie Institution of Washington note that whatever
texturing mechanism operates to form the anisotropic grain of the inner
core, it must be almost 100 percent efficient. Otherwise the seismic
anisotropy would not be as large as measured. "The very strong texturing
indicated by our results suggests the possibility that the inner core is
a very large single crystal," they boldly stated in a article published
last year in <I>Science.</I>

<P>The seemingly absurd notion--that a body the size of the moon could
be just one big crystal--is less ridiculous than it sounds. The central
core may have grown gradually to its present size as liquid iron at the
bottom of the outer core solidified and attached itself to the inner
core. That process would occur exceedingly slowly, with few outside
disturbances--just like the conditions that favor the growth of large
crystals in a lab. Slow solidification of iron might have allowed the
inner core to grow quietly for billions of years, becoming in the end a
gargantuan single crystal, more than 2,400 kilometers across.

<P>But slow crystal growth does not explain the alignment of the inner
core's axis of anisotropy with the earth's rotation axis. The process
also fails to account for the seismological evidence that the
anisotropic grain is not uniform. Xiaodong Song, a seismologist at
Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, says that the
anisotropy at the top of the inner core "is likely to be very weak--less
than 1 percent." So it would seem that some other physical mechanism
must keep the deeper hexagonal iron crystals in line.

<P>Although several explanations have been proposed, the most reasonable
theory calls on internal stress (generated by the earth's rotation),
which is strongest along the north-south axis. Thus, the hexagonal iron
that constitutes the inner core could crystallize (or recrystallize) in
parallel with the spin axis--as do the mica flakes that form in rocks
squeezed by tectonic forces. Internal stress could thus keep the inner
core's grain well aligned with the spin axis--perhaps too well aligned.
It turns out that the grain of the inner core is not exactly parallel to
the earth's rotation axis: in 1994 Wei-jia Su and Adam M. Dziewonski of
Harvard University reported that the axis of anisotropy is in fact
tilted by about 10 degrees.

<P>At about the same time, Gary A. Glatzmaier of Los Alamos National
Laboratory and Paul H. Roberts of the University of California at Los
Angeles were working on a <A HREF="http://ees5-www.lanl.gov/IGPP/EarthsMagneticField.html">computer simulation of how the earth's
magnetic field operates</A>. Although the tumultuous churning of the outer
core's liquid iron creates this magnetic field, Glatzmaier and Roberts
found that the influence of the solid inner core was needed for proper
stability. Their modeling also indicated that the inner core may be
shifting slowly eastward with respect to the earth's surface, impelled
by persistent fluid motions at the base of the outer core.

<P>Reading that result and realizing that the seismic grain of the inner
core was not wholly aligned with the spin axis, Song and his colleague
Paul G. Richards decided to look for seismic evidence that the canted
grain of the inner core was indeed swiveling around relative to the rest
of the earth. Their idea was to examine seismic recordings of waves that
traveled through the inner core decades ago and to compare them with
more recent signals. If the core rotates, the time it takes these waves
to traverse the inner core should change systematically. The challenge
was to find recordings of seismic waves that passed close to the
north-south axis and to devise a way to compare them precisely enough to
detect the slight differences that result from less than 30 years of
change (the span of seismic records). But they solved both problems and
found evidence of rotation quite quickly. "Everything happened in three
weeks," Richards notes.

<P>The team started by looking at seismic traces recorded in Antarctica
caused by nuclear tests made at Novaya Zemlya in the Soviet Arctic.
Traveling from one pole to another, these seismic waves penetrated the
core. Examining data that had been collected over the course of a
decade, Song and Richards observed what appeared to be a change of two
tenths of a second in the travel time of the waves that passed through
the inner core as compared with those that just skirted it. They then
scrutinized a set of seismic recordings made in Alaska of earthquakes
that occurred between the tip of South America and Antarctica and found
similar results to confirm that the inner core was in fact moving. They
presented their discovery in the July 18 issue of <I>Nature.</I>

<P>Although the detection of <A HREF="http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/song/pr.html">inner core movement</A> was itself a remarkable
experimental achievement, the correspondence in direction and speed of
this motion (eastward at a degree or two a year) with the predictions of
Glatzmaier and Roberts was more remarkable still. But geophysicists are
far from having figured out the workings of the inner core. No one yet
understands for sure what causes its anisotropic grain. Nor can
scientists explain why the anisotropy should be tilted. According to
Glatzmaier, "It's anybody's guess at this point."

METEOROLOGY

<center><H2>HURRICANE HULLABALOO?</H2>

Atlantic cyclones prove to be in decline</center>

<P>In a 1990 publication entitled <I>Windstorm, </I>Munich Re, one of the world's
largest reinsurance companies (firms that provide coverage to other insurers),
stated that <A HREF="http://cirrus.sprl.umich.edu/wxnet/tropical.html">tropical cyclones</A> "will increase not only in frequency and intensity
but also in duration and size of areas at risk." That notion echoes throughout
much media commentary on the effects of global warming, and just last year the
U.S. Senate's task force on funding disaster relief reported that such hurricanes
"have become increasingly frequent and severe over the last four decades as
climatic conditions have changed in the tropics." But this worrisome conclusion
has recently been challenged by four scientists. They looked carefully at the
long-term trend in the occurrence of Atlantic hurricanes and found that these
storms have become less threatening over the past half century.

<P>Christopher W. Landsea, a meteorologist with the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration Hurricane Research Division, and three colleagues
analyzed the history of hurricanes in the North Atlantic Ocean, the Gulf of
Mexico and the Caribbean Sea. They focused on these regions because their weather
patterns have been subject to aerial reconnaissance since World War II, whereas
reliable records for other tropical seas extend back only to the late 1960s.
Their results appeared in the June 15 issue of <I>Geophysical Research
Letters.</I>

<P>What these meteorologists found was a definite decline in the frequency of
intense Atlantic hurricanes. They also observed a modest slackening in the
highest winds sustained by each year's most intense hurricane, although that
slight decrease may not represent a statistically significant trend.

<P>With this evolution toward more benign conditions, why do so many in the
eastern U.S. perceive the situation as worsening with time? According to Landsea
and his colleagues, the reason is straightforward: the amount of damage from
hurricanes inevitably grows even if the storms are slowly moderating simply
because population and property development are on the rise along many stretches
of the Atlantic coast. As Landsea, himself a new resident of Florida, aptly
notes, "Miami is a great example of that."

<BR>Nitric oxide, former molecule of the year as pronounced by the
journal <I>Science, </I>has not just been resting on its laurels. For
one thing, it's been spewing out of car exhausts, inadvertently messing
up at least one laboratory's research and raising the intriguing
possibility that NO is better for you than Nancy Reagan could ever have
dreamed.

<P>Pharmacologists at the Free University of Berlin kept getting strange
results in their experiments with the enzyme guanylyl cyclase, which is
important in the biochemistry of lung tissue. Knowing that guanylyl
cyclase is a receptor for NO, the researchers, led by Doris Koesling,
began to wonder if their samples were being exposed to some NO wafting
in from outside. So Koesling took the lab on the road and measured
guanylyl cyclase activity at a site 30 feet from one of the city's main
highways. The enzyme's activity shot up as much as six times when
measurements showed an atmospheric NO concentration of 550 parts per
billion, according to Koesling's recent report in <I>Nature</I>.

<P>In the lung, NO stimulates guanylyl cyclase, which causes a chain of
biochemical events that ultimately relaxes smooth muscle, making it
easier for blood to flow. Koesling says the enzyme's response to
atmospheric NO furthers the case for using this compound as a treatment
for lung disorders. In 1993 a <I>New England Journal of Medicine
</I>paper showed that inhaling NO helped people with pulmonary
hypertension and acute respiratory failure.

<P>Guanylyl cyclase's sensitivity to NO--no matter its origin--raises
provocative questions for those persnickety breathers who prefer smooth,
rather than chunky, air. Could people who seek out the pure air of the
southwestern desert save plane fare and content themselves with two
weeks at the airport taxi stand? Might New Yorkers congregate outside
the gaping maw of the Lincoln Tunnel during the evening crush to suck in
life-giving exhaust fumes? Are some urban dwellers with lung conditions
already benefiting unwittingly from polluted air?

<P>"It cannot be ruled out," Koesling says. (Stop here when you read
this on the air, Mr. Limbaugh.) But don't take NO for an answer just
yet. "On the other hand," she continues, "these effects are going to be
counteracted by the other toxic constituents of air pollution." At last
report, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, ozone and nitrogen dioxide,
other major pollutants in the air, were still no NO's.

<center><H2>UNICORN HUNTS?</H2>

Searching for monopoles, <BR>free quarks and antimatter</center>

<P>Bigfoot and other legendary creatures remain popular in part because
they could exist--their presence does not necessarily violate any
natural law, and their discovery would cause a sensation. The same can
be said for long-sought, primordial beasts of physics. They need not
exist, and there are reasons to suspect they don't. But despite the
unlikelihood, some researchers find them too irresistible to pass up.

<P>The search for particles called magnetic monopoles is one example.
Rather than having north and south poles, magnetic monopoles would have
only one pole and could weigh as much as a few micrograms; they could
have emerged during the big bang from early defects in space. But
hundreds of searches in this century have come up empty. The most recent
disappointment came last year. Hunmoo Jeon and Michael J. Longo of the
University of Michigan sifted through 112 kilograms of meteorite, hoping
to locate some of the primordial stuff trapped within. "It's getting
harder and harder to believe we're going to find them," Longo admits.
The best bet may be underground neutrino detectors, which can also
record any monopoles zipping through. But if they don't appear, there is
no cause for any theoretical anxiety. Modifications to the big bang
theory (most prominently, inflation) obviate the need for monopoles.

<P>The same can be said for free quarks. Quarks are the fundamental
building blocks of matter, combining into pairs or triplets to form
protons, neutrons and other subatomic particles. They also remain
forever trapped within the particles they create. But some physicists
speculate that despite the strong arguments for quark bondage, free
quarks might have formed during the big bang (a few moments after
monopoles) and managed to remain unfettered. But three decades of
searching have proved fruitless. The late William Fairbank of Stanford
University reported positive results in the 1980s, but his work could
not be reproduced. The lack of success and, subsequently, funding has
forced physicists galore to drop out of the chase.

<P>Only Martin L. Perl of Stanford remains. Relying on a variation of
the famous Millikan oil-drop experiment, Perl sends micron-size droplets
between two charged plates; the plates deflect the droplets depending on
their charge. Quarks carry a 1/3 or 2/3 charge, so a free quark might
give a droplet an additional fractional charge. Searches begin next year
using ground-up meteorites.

<P>Perl knows finding free quarks is a long shot. "It's the kind of
thing a tenured professor can do. A young person wouldn't get money from
funding agencies," he notes. "It would wreck their careers." Winner of
the 1995 Nobel Prize for Physics, Perl does not have that worry,
although he plans to abandon the pursuit if nothing turns up in the next
four years.

<P>Leveraging his own prize, Samuel Ting of the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology has initiated an unlikely hunt, too--for primordial
antimatter. Created during the big bang (shortly after free quarks), it
might exist in distant pockets of the cosmos, producing an oppositely
charged, complementary universe. But no one has ever seen anything
resembling celestial antiobjects. (Antiparticles exist in cosmic rays,
but they emerge as by-products of collisions of particles in space.)
Theorists postulate that a slight asymmetry in the laws of physics early
in the big bang favored the production of matter over antimatter. That
asymmetry, observed in experiments in particle accelerators, has
convinced many that bulk antimatter is not around.

<P>Such thinking amounts to little more than theoretical prejudice,
claims Ting, who has organized an international effort to loft an
antimatter detector into orbit. The instrument consists of a giant
permanent magnet that would deflect charged particles to detectors. The
device, called the alpha magnetic spectrometer, or AMS, will be 100,000
times more sensitive to antimatter than current technologies are. Tests
begin on the space shuttle in May 1998; full-time operations are
scheduled to start on the International Space Station in 2001. "For the
first time, we'll have a particle detector big enough and up long enough
to cleanly distinguish particle from antiparticle," says AMS project
member Steven P. Ahlen of Boston University.

<P>Not that it matters, says Gregory Tarl&#233; of the University of Michigan
and a critic of AMS. If primordial antimatter existed within the
device's detection range of about one billion light-years, then certain
clues would be evident, most notably in the number of photons. The
universe would literally be a brighter place. Besides, if any antimatter
exists, the magnetic field between galaxies will keep antiparticles from
reaching the detector, Tarl&#233; concludes. "Primordial antimatter is not
going to be seen," he predicts. "It's like looking for monkeys on the
moon." A somewhat pricey trip to the zoo as well: $20 million, not
including labor and launch costs.

<P>In Tarl&#233;'s opinion, politics, not science, spawned AMS. The
Department of Energy, the project's sponsor, wanted to keep Ting busy
after Congress killed the Superconducting Super Collider, Tarl says.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration, too, stood to
benefit: Ting's project would be used to fend off criticism that the
space station has little scientific merit.

<P>"If all AMS was going to look for was antimatter, then maybe it's not
worth doing," Ahlen concedes. The project is worthwhile, he argues,
because AMS has secondary tasks: it will investigate the origin of
cosmic rays and the dark matter thought to permeate the universe.

<P>The quest for exotica stems partly from the state of particle
physics. "We're in a quiet, stagnant period," Perl comments, likening
the time to optics in the 1930s. Only after masers and lasers appeared
in the 1950s did the field boom. "I believe there will be
breakthroughs," he adds. "When, I don't know."  So don't hold your
breath.

<B>Hormonal Relief from Alzheimer's</B>

<P>Evidence from animal research and from studies on postmenopausal
women suggests that estrogen replacement might help fight Alzheimer's
disease. The finding has prompted federal funding of clinical trials in
38 medical centers around the U.S. Researchers, led by Sally Schumacher
of the Bowman Gray School of Medicine in North Carolina, will
investigate the effectiveness of estrogen supplements in preventing the
debilitating disease in women. (Preliminary evidence also suggests that
supplements of testosterone, which is converted to estrogen in the
brain, might delay or prevent the disease in elderly men.)

<P><HR><B>Garden of Earthly Stench</B>

<P>Anticipating a whiff of the notoriously malodorous <I>Amorphophallus
titanum </I>plant, hundreds of people crowded the Princess of Wales
Conservatory at Kew Gardens in London on July 31, only to have botanist
Peter Boyce tell them they had missed the "treat." The meter-high
Sumatran <A HREF="http://florawww.eeb.uconn.edu/acc_num\950115.htm">titan arum</A>, which last flowered 33 years ago, reportedly emits
an odor likened to a mixture of "rotting fish and burnt sugar with an
overtone of urine"--but only when ready to be pollinated. Boyce claims
the entire greenhouse reeked the night before, but the following day the
crowd couldn't smell a thing.

<P><HR><B>Remarkable Sight</B>

<P>True or false: (a) Falling anvils are harmless. (b) Spinach makes you
superhumanly strong. (c) Some animals can pop their eyes out of their
head at will. If you answered false to (c), zoologists at the University
of Michigan and Northern Arizona University have news for you. They
recently photographed <I><A HREF="http://www.sfo.com/%7Emorriss/eels.html">Scolecomorphus</A> kirkii </I>sticking its eyes out
of its head. This limbless amphibian from East Africa performs the trick
using protrusible tentacles on either side of its snout.

<P><HR><B>Ultraviolet Radiation on the Rise</B>

<P>Since 1972 the amount of damaging ultraviolet rays reaching the
earth's surface has risen dramatically, atmospheric scientists from NASA
report. Data from the <A HREF="http://jwocky.gsfc.nasa.gov/index.html">Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer</A> mounted on board
the <I>Nimbus 7 </I>satellite reveal that ultraviolet radiation has
risen an average of 6.8 percent a decade in the Northern Hemisphere and
9.9 percent a decade in the South. Dwindling protection from the
diminishing ozone layer is most likely to blame.

<P><HR><B>Choosing Abortion</B>

<P>About half of all U.S. women will opt to abort an unwanted pregnancy
at some point in their life, a survey from the <A HREF="http://www.social.com/health/nhic/data/hr0100/hr0145.html">Alan Guttmacher Institute</A>
finds. These women, two thirds of whom intend to have children in the
future, come from every age group, race, social class and
creed--including those thought to oppose abortion. Catholic women, for
example, had an abortion rate that was 29 percent higher than that of
Protestant women. Six out of 10 women having abortions used protection.

<P><HR><B>A Fish Smarter Than a Man</B>

<P>The human brain uses 20 percent of the oxygen that the body does--way
above the 2 to 8 percent common in other vertebrates. Now the diminutive
African elephant-nose fish has nudged humans aside: its brain needs
fully 60 percent of the oxygen that its body consumes. According to the
<I><A HREF="http://www.cityscape.co.uk/users/ag64/1996/jeb0101.htm">Journal of Experimental Biology</A>, </I>the large ratio comes from the
creature's being cold-blooded, as well as its enormous brain. Of the
fish's body mass, 3.1 percent is brain--compared with 2.3 percent for a
human.

<P><HR><B>Spinal Repairs</B>

<P>Researchers at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm have devised a
technique to <A HREF="http://science-mag.aaas.org/science/scripts/display/short/273/5274/451.html">repair severed spinal cords</A> in rats. After cutting the
spinal columns of two rats, they implanted tiny nerves in the gap and
applied acidic fibroblast growth factor. Within six months new axons had
bridged the spinal divide. Yet neither rat recovered coordinated
locomotion, leaving open the question of how much the technique would
help quadriplegic humans.

<P><HR><B>An Ocean on Jupiter's Europa?</B>

<P>Scientists have long wondered whether Europa, a moon of Jupiter,
harbors a liquid ocean beneath its icy crust. Fuzzy pictures from the
<I>Voyager </I>spacecraft revealed surprisingly few craters; perhaps
upwelling water filled them in. If so, conditions might have been
compatible at some point with the existence of life. Such speculation
got a boost in August when images retrieved from <I>Galileo </I>showed a
surface riddled with filled cracks similar to those seen in Earth's
polar ice floes. Closer flybys in December and February will gather more
detailed evidence. For more images, <A HREF="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/releases/europh20.html">click here</A>. 

<P><HR>FOLLOW-UP

<P><B>Software Gone Awry</B>

<P>Investigators appointed by the European Space Agency reported in July
that a software bug brought down the new $8-billion <I><A HREF="http://www.esrin.esa.it/htdocs/esa/ariane/ariane5.html">Ariane 5</A>
</I>rocket, which exploded in June and was supposed to have a major role
as a platform for space exploration. The team found that an unused,
unnecessary routine in the software controlling the rocket's engines was
ultimately responsible for the crash. Apparently, further testing of
this guidance software might have caught the glitch. (See September
1994, page 86.)

<P><HR><B>Halt, Aquatic Interloper</B>

<P>Ships currently change their ballast water at sea to prevent
species--such as the zebra mussel--from upsetting marine ecosystems that
they are not native to. But a recent <A HREF="http://www2.nas.edu/whatsnew/24b6.html">National Research Council (NRC)
report</A> found that the technique is dangerous because it can destabilize
ships. Further, the practice is not completely effective, as some
organisms remain glued to the bottom of the tanks. The NRC recommends
instead that ships filter their ballast water before it is taken in or
else treat it with heat or biocides to kill organisms before it is
discharged. (See October 1992, page 22.)

CANCER THERAPY

<center><H2>"X" (RAYS) MARK THE TUMOR</H2>

A technology used <BR>to develop nuclear weapons <BR>may lead to an effective
<BR>cancer treatment</center>

<P>One of the most seductive propositions in cancer therapy research is
that the body's immune system may somehow be stimulated or trained to
fight more effectively and even to destroy the cancerous tumors that can
spread throughout the body. From humble beginnings more than a century
ago, work on such treatments, which fall under a broad classification
known as immunotherapy, has lately benefited from revolutionary advances
in the understanding of the immune system.

<P>Now, in what is surely one of the most unusual twists in
immunotherapy, researchers in Amarillo, Tex., have taken an instrument
originally used in the development of nuclear weapons and applied it to
a key immunotherapeutic challenge: boosting the body's immune response
to a tumor. They say the technique could be used against any
adenocarcinoma, a category that includes the most deadly cancers, such
as those of the breast, prostate, lung, colon, liver and ovary.

<P>At the heart of the experiments is a technique called x-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Using this device, researchers bathe a
sample substance in x-rays. Atoms in the sample absorb the x-ray photons
and then eject electrons. Measurements of the kinetic energy of these
photoelectrons indicate which atoms are present at the surface of the
molecules in the sample. In other words, XPS allows investigators to
characterize the surface of the molecules in a certain substance.

<P>The team unites scientists from the Texas Tech University Health
Sciences Center, the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Amarillo and the
Mason &AMP Hanger Corporation. Under contract to the U.S. Department of
Energy, Mason &AMP Hanger runs the Pantex plant, a sprawling complex
northeast of Amarillo where the U.S. assembled most of its nuclear
weapons. Mason &AMP Hanger scientists used their $700,000 x-ray
photoelectron spectrometer to improve the way that conventional high
explosives were united to substances known as binders, which enabled the
explosives to be molded into the necessary shapes.

<P>In the cancer research, on the other hand, the scientists are
studying a substance called mucin, a component of mucus (mucin is what
makes mucus slippery). Mucin is a widely studied and fairly well
understood tumor-specific marker; these markers are proteins that are
distinctly altered when they are produced by cancerous cells. When
created by a healthy cell, a mucin molecule consists of a protein core
surrounded by a carbohydrate (sugar) coating. Ordinarily, the protein
makes up 20 percent of the mass of the molecule, and the coating makes
up the rest. When manufactured by a cancerous cell, however, the mucin
molecule partly or completely lacks its carbohydrate coating; this
absence lets the body's immune system recognize the molecule as an
antigen and to launch an immune response against it. Unfortunately, the
response triggered by an initial exposure is insufficient to eliminate
the cancerous cells associated with the aberrant mucin.

<P>By subtly altering such mucin molecules and testing the affinity of
isolated (laboratory) antibodies and white blood cells for them, the
Amarillo team was able to get an idea of how mucin interacts with the
immune system. Specifically, workers used XPS to study the surface of
the molecule, which let them begin figuring out the relation between the
molecule's coating--or lack thereof--and immune response.

<P>They then used this information to create mutated mucin core
proteins, which were exposed to the white blood cells and antibodies.
Antigens associated with some of these mutated mucin molecules initiated
cellular immune responses more vigorous than those associated with
unmutated molecules. In one startling assay, a mutated mucin protein
resulted in the production of 30 times more tumor-specific white blood
cells than did an ordinary mucin core in the same period. "People have
tried to do this in the past, but the resolution hasn't been there,"
says Kenneth E. Dombrowski, a biochemist at the Veterans Affairs Medical
Center and a professor at Texas Tech University. "Now we're seeing
things that haven't been seen before."

<P>To add more detail to their picture of mucin and its interactions
with white blood cells and antibodies, the Amarillo researchers are
collaborating with scientists at Duke University, who are using nuclear
magnetic resonance and mass spectroscopy techniques to determine the
structure and size of the mucin molecule. A molecule's structure, size
and surface features all seem to play a role in the intensity of the
immune response triggered by the molecule, Dombrowski notes.

<P>Treatments stemming from these findings could take one of at least
two forms. Mutated mucins could be used outside the body to stimulate
the production of tumor-specific white blood cells, so that there are
more of them available to destroy the cancerous cells; these white blood
cells could then be put back inside the body to reproduce and to battle
the tumor. Further in the future, a genetic vaccine might be engineered
to enter cells and induce the cells' own protein-making machinery to
make the desired mutated mucin, which would stimulate the heightened
immune response directly. Because the mutations needed to evoke the
immune response are the same regardless of malignancy, the same vaccine
would work for essentially any adenocarcinoma.

<P>While cautioning that it may be several years, at least, before
trials can be conducted in human patients, researchers are also quick to
note the advent of what appears to be a promising union. "The marriage
of XPS and protein biochemistry is in its infancy," Dombrowski asserts.

BIOTECHNOLOGY

<center><H2>PICKING ON COTTON</H2>

Engineered crops need fewer pesticides <BR>but may foster resistance</center>

<P>U.S. cotton growers who had hoped that gene technology would relieve
them of the need to spray their crops suffered a disappointment this
year. In many southern states, fields of cotton engineered to produce
their own supply of a naturally occurring insecticide--<I>Bacillus
thuringiensis</I> toxin, or <I>Bt</I>--have succumbed to an unusually
severe attack of the cotton bollworm.

<P>Farmers have had to dust off their chemical sprayers and treat the
infestation in the old-fashioned way. The bollworm's stand against the
insecticide has renewed concerns that the rapid adoption of
<I>Bt</I>-producing crops could encourage the evolution of <I>Bt</I>
resistance among pests. Mindful of that alarming prospect, the
Environmental Protection Agency recently restricted sales of a new
<I>Bt</I>-producing corn to states that do not produce cotton. The
combination of <I>Bt</I> corn and <I>Bt</I> cotton is worrisome because
several pests migrate between the two plants, making it all the more
plausible that having both crops in proximity might in some
circumstances in fact speed the development of resistance.

<P>According to <A HREF="http://www.monsanto.com/">Monsanto</A>, the developer of the <I>Bt</I> cotton, the
majority of the two million acres of the crop planted this year have not
required extra spraying. Randy Deaton, Monsanto's scientist in charge of
the product, estimates it is probably killing the same proportion of
bollworms as it did during testing, but because bollworm numbers are in
some areas the highest they have been in 20 years, the insect survivors
are more noticeable. Moreover, Deaton points out, <I>Bt</I> cotton is
still highly effective against another pest, the tobacco budworm, so
farmers who planted the high-tech crop are still likely to come out
ahead. Deaton maintains there is no evidence that <I>Bt</I> cotton,
which is sold by Delta and Pine Land Company under license, has failed
to produce the expected amounts of the toxin, a situation that might
foster resistance.

<P>That assurance does not satisfy Margaret Mellon of the <A HREF="http://www.ucsusa.org/textonly/textonly.index.html">Union of
Concerned Scientists (UCS)</A>, who argues that the bollworm's incursion
into <I>Bt</I> cotton fields means the resistance management plan that
Monsanto accepted as a condition for approval of its product has failed.
The UCS has accordingly asked the EPA to suspend <I>Bt </I>cotton sales.

<P>The agency sees no reason so far to justify such a move, and
researchers agree resistance is, in any event, unlikely to occur for
several years. Yet the severe restrictions that the EPA has placed on
sales of a new, high-<I>Bt-</I>producing  corn plant it approved in
August indicate that concerns about resistance may ultimately limit
cultivation of <I>Bt </I>crops. The <I>Bt</I> corn, sold by Northrup
King and also based on Monsanto technology, cannot be sold in nine
southern states and parts of four others. (The company is currently
appealing the restriction.)

<P>Fred L. Gould, an entomologist at North Carolina State University,
points out that resistance to conventional pesticides has become "a real
headache." In time, he believes, resistance to <I>Bt</I> will also
emerge, but if properly managed it should be possible to keep under
control. "Our concern," he declares, "is that they don't overuse it."

COMPUTING

<center><H2>PROGRAMMING WITH <BR>PRIMORDIAL OOZE</H2>

Useful software begins <BR>to crawl out of digital gene pools</center>

<P>Computer programmers ascended the economic food chain by inventing
clever algorithms to make manufacturing and service laborers redundant.
But some programmers may one day find themselves automated out of a job.
In university labs, scientists are teaching computers how to write their
own programs. Borrowing from the principles of natural selection, the
researchers have built artificial ecosystems that, for a few problems at
least, can evolve solutions better than any yet devised by humans.
Someday such systems may even be able to design new kinds of computers.

<P>The idea of evolving rather than inducing algorithms is not new. John
H. Holland of the University of Michigan worked out the method 21 years
ago. But Holland's strategy, based on a rigorous analogy to chromosomes,
is limited to problems whose solutions can be expressed as mathematical
formulas. It works well only if a human programmer figures out how many
numbers the computer should plug into the formula.

<P>In 1992 <A HREF="http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/%7Ekoza/index.html">John R. Koza</A>, a computer scientist at Stanford University,
extended Holland's method to evolve entire programs of virtually any
size and form. A field was born, and this past July several hundred
disciples gathered at the first Genetic Programming Conference to show
off their latest creations.

<P>Jaime J. Fernandez of Rice University, for example, reported evolving
a program to help control a prosthetic hand. The software analyzes the
erratic nerve signals picked up by three electrodes taped around a
subject's wrist and can tell, with perfect accuracy, which way he moved
his thumb. Fernandez's team is now collecting data from amputees missing
a hand to see whether the technique can be applied to them.

<P>Brian Howley of Lockheed Martin Missiles and Space guided the
evolution of a program that can figure out how to maneuver a spacecraft
from one orientation to another within 2 percent of the theoretical
minimum time--10 percent faster than a solution hand-crafted by an
expert. And researchers at University College in Cork, Ireland, grew a
system that can convert regular programs, which execute instructions one
at a time, into parallel programs that carry out some instructions
simultaneously.

<P>To create their software, Fernandez and Howley did not have to divine
insights into neurophysiology or rocket science. The task of the genetic
programmer is simpler. First, build an environment that rewards programs
that are faster, more accurate or better by some other measure. Second,
create a population of seed programs by randomly combining elements from
a "gene pool" of appropriate functions and program statements. Then sit
back and let evolution take its course. Artificial selection works just
like the natural variety: each program is fed data and then run until it
halts or produces a result. The worst performers in each generation are
deleted, whereas the best reproduce and breed--that is, swap chunks of
code with other attractive programs. Occasionally, a random mutation
changes a variable here or adds a command there.

<P>The technique can generate solutions even when the programmers know
little about the problem. But there is a price: the evolved code can be
as messy and inscrutable as a squashed bug. Fernandez's
gesture-predicting program consists of a single line so long that it
fills an entire page and contains hundreds of nested parenthetical
expressions. It reveals nothing about why the thumb moves a certain
way--only that it does.

<P>Just as in the real world, evolution is not necessarily the fastest
process either. Howley's speedy workstation churned for 83 hours to
produce a satellite-control program that beat human ingenuity in eight
test cases. And when it was presented with situations it had never
encountered, the program failed, a common problem with evolved software.
(Of course, the human expert's program failed on the new cases as well.)

<P>To address some of these limitations, computer scientists are
extending their technique. <A HREF="http://hamp.hampshire.edu/%7ElasCCS/Home.html">Lee Spector</A> of Hampshire College in Amherst,
Mass., allows the programs in his ecosystems to share a common memory as
they compete to demonstrate their fitness. "This means that a 'good
idea' developed by any individual may be preserved for use by all
others," Spector says--essentially, it allows the community of programs
to evolve a culture. He reports that the innovation reduced the
computational effort required to solve a tricky mathematical problem by
39 percent.

<P>"It is possible," Spector says, "to use genetic programming to
produce programs that themselves develop in significant, structural ways
over the course of their 'life spans'"--a strategy he calls ontogenetic
programming. He demonstrated one such system that can predict the next
value in a sequence of numbers so complicated that it has stumped
regular genetic programming systems.

<P>Ultimately, evolved software may lead to evolved hardware, thanks to
the recent invention of circuit boards that can reconstruct their
circuit designs under software control. Adrian Thompson of the
University of Sussex turned a genetic programming system loose on one
such board to see whether it could produce a circuit to decode a binary
signal sent over an analog telephone line. Using just 100 switches on
the board, the system came up with a near-perfect solution after 3,500
generations. Although the task is simple, "it would be difficult for a
designer to solve this problem in such a small area and with no external
components," Thompson says.

<P>"Hardware evolution demands a radical rethink of what electronic
circuits can be," he argues, because evolution exploits the
idiosyncratic behavior that electrical engineers try to avoid. Although
genetic programs are largely still fermenting in their primordial ooze,
it seems just a matter of time until they crawl out to find their niche.

<B>Snailmail Fights Back.</B> Starting this winter, the U.S. Postal
Service can stamp your e-mail with a time and date, according to Ken
Ceglowski of the USPS. Customers will be able to send their e-mail or
documents to a USPS server; the machine will electronically postmark the
correspondence, digitally sign it and forward it to an e-mail address or
World Wide Web site. The process--which will cost about 22 cents for
documents 50K in size or less--should take about two minutes, Ceglowski
says. Mail dispatched electronically by the USPS will probably travel
with legal protection similar to that guarding physical mail: the
electronic postmark will be analogous to an envelope's cancellation
mark, widely recognized as "proof" that the message existed at a
specific moment; the authentication routines will be equivalent to the
seal of a paper envelope, guaranteeing that the message has not been
altered since it arrived at the mailbox--in this case, the USPS server.
This legal protection may prove to be a strong selling point, for
garden-variety e-mail carries with it no penalties for tampering.

<P><B>Cookies Redux.</B> Cookie technology is still with us in Netscape
3.0. A "cookie" is a nugget of information about you that is established
by the Web site server when you go visiting--it provides information
about what pages you see, for instance, or what language you speak. The
cookie is stored on your hard drive; when you revisit a site, it is
retrieved by the machine that set it in the first place. This can be
very useful if, for example, you want information about, say, your
preferred method of payment immediately known when you reach a favorite
on-line shopping site. 

<P>But if cookies are handy for Web shoppers,
site developers, advertisers and trackers, they are irritating and
intrusive to many users who do not want to leave behind a digital
fingerprint. Cookie filters and browser proxies offer inventive ways to
avoid the files. <A HREF="http://www.privnet.com">PrivNet's Internet
Fast Forward</A> blocks the browser from sending cookies. (The program
can also block ads, eliminating not only the banners but the time spent
downloading them.) <A HREF="http://www.anonymizer.com">Anonymizer</A> is
similar to a proxy service; it acts as a go-between. Justin A. Boyan, a
graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University, wrote the software.
"Surfing feels anonymous, like reading a newspaper," he comments, "but
it's not." The latest version of Netscape Navigator--as well as other
browsers that support it, such as Microsoft Explorer--permits users to
reject cookies, but they must do so one by one. "What Netscape needs is
a feature saying, 'Look, I never want to see another cookie again,'"
Boyan advises.

<CENTER><H2>WAYNE B. JONAS</H2>

<B>Probing medicine's outer reaches</B></center>

<P>The high-speed Polaroid photograph has just emerged from the camera,
revealing the places where my fingers have touched the film. Joe Hall,
the president of Clarus Systems, a maker of "personal energy" products,
notes that the outlines of my fingertips form a series of broken dots
and not a continuous ellipsoid, indicating that my body's energy
centers, or chakras, are not resonating properly.

<P>Hall thinks I may have been exposed to excessive man-made
electromagnetic radiation, which has increased, he informs me,
100-millionfold since 1940. Broadcasts of Lucille Ball and Don Imus no
doubt bear the blame. But for $129, Hall is willing to sell me the
Q-Link--a microchip equipped with an antenna--that when worn around the
neck brings one into "harmonic resonance."

<P>Unfortunately, I have little time for the Q-Link at this
alternative-medicine conference in Alexandria, Va. Nor can I submit to
the tongue and fingernail analysis by a Dr. Chi or examine the
toothbrush he sells with the magnets that supposedly suck plaque off
teeth.

<P>The reason for my rush is an appointment at the massive National
Institutes of Health complex in Bethesda, across the Beltway. There, in
the same complex of buildings that houses the directors of institutes
that devote themselves to research pursuits ranging from cancer to
mental health is the <A HREF="http://www.aamc.org/research/adhocgp/alter.htm">Office of Alternative Medicine (OAM)</A>. The OAM
administers a $7.48-million-a-year program to assist the medical
establishment and the public in making sense of assorted nostrums,
potions and electromagnetic-field generators.

<P>Wayne B. Jonas is the tall, athletic-looking, 41-year-old head of the
OAM. His job--and that of about a dozen other NIH employees--came about
because of Congress's desire in 1991 to get the world's largest health
research institution to stop ignoring the potential benefits of
unorthodox remedies such as bee pollen for allergies and antineoplastons
(peptides originally derived from urine) for cancer. Jonas took over in
July 1995 from Joseph Jacobs, who had resigned nearly a year earlier
after complaining about being hounded by congressional staffers pushing
pet projects and an OAM advisory council that included many advocates of
unproved cancer cures.

<P>By many accounts, Jonas has built the administrative structure needed
to run a research program. On paper, he has the ideal background to
juggle the competing claims placed on the office by mainstream
researchers and the alternative-medicine community. He is a primary-care
physician, who, as a lieutenant colonel in the army, had the opportunity
to study and then teach research methods at the Walter Reed Army
Institute of Research in Washington, D.C.

<P>Alternative-medicine advocates are reassured by the fact that Jonas
has received training in practices ranging from homeopathy and
acupuncture to bioenergetics and spiritual healing. Moreover, he has had
no significant prior association with the NIH, the Food and Drug
Administration, the American Medical Association or the pharmaceutical
industry. (Advocates of alternative medicine sometimes characterize
officials at these institutions as "jackbooted thugs.")

<P>Still unclear, however, is whether Jonas can reconcile his commitment
to running a serious research program with his personal belief in the
merits of alternative medicine. When we first meet, his subdued,
no-nonsense manner reminds me more of an army logistics specialist than
of a lifelong student of alternative therapies, an impression he makes
little attempt to allay. "I came to the office to try to get this area
in shape and do good science, and what better way to do it than to apply
a little military discipline," remarks the lieutenant colonel, who once
headed a clinic on a military base in Germany.

<P>During his first year as head of the OAM, Jonas appears to have met
his self-set goal. He expanded the staff and put in place procedures and
guidelines for managing a program that had been described by observers
as chaotic. His low-key manner belies a forceful personality: after he
expresses irritation at some of my questions and comments, the OAM's
press officer, Anita Greene, calls <I>Scientific American</I> to ask
that another writer be assigned to the story.

<P>Like a mantra, Jonas repeats the idea that rigorous research will
separate the good from the bad in an environment that he likens to a
"circus." During the interview, his interest in homeopathy seems
objective and clinical. He acknowledges that homeopathy--which often
involves administering a substance in doses so small that, in theory,
not even a single molecule of it remains--may serve only as a placebo.
Even if it does, Jonas adds, the mechanism by which it works deserves
study.

<P>But Jonas is more of a true believer than he at first lets on. Most
practitioners of alternative medicine readily ply journalists with the
latest book they've written or promotional literature about their
favorite therapy. While I am in his office, Jonas omits to mention that
he has just co-authored a book--<I>Healing with Homeopathy: The Complete
Guide</I>--that was published in August by Warner Books.

<P>Jonas later says he had not wanted to promote his work on "official"
time, but this explanation seems somewhat disingenuous. The book's
narrator exudes an emotional depth and passion for alternative
medicine--feelings never expressed during the interview.

<P>In his writing, Jonas describes the Bowman Gray School of Medicine in
North Carolina, where his interest in alternative medicine led him to be
repeatedly rebuffed by his professors. After he suggested a homeopathic
remedy for a patient with severe antibiotic-resistant pneumonia, his
supervisors asked him to repeat his rotation in medicine. "Use of
nonconventional treatments, when appropriate, requires an open mind, a
skill usually not taught in medical school," Jonas remarks in one
chapter.

<P>In another passage, he forwards the notion--echoed by many
alternative-medicine practitioners--that his views may one day transform
medicine and science. "Just as the discovery of infectious agents
revolutionized our ability to care for many diseases at the turn of the
century," he states, "the discovery of what happens when a homeopathic
preparation is made and how it impacts the body might revolutionize our
understanding of chemistry, biology and medicine."

<P>The infrastructure established by the OAM that might allow
homeopathy, herbal remedies and Ayurvedic medicine (traditional Hindu
healing) to complement modern Western medical practices is built around
a nucleus of 10 university-based centers as well as a basic research
program at the NIH. The centers will conduct or manage research in areas
such as AIDS, cancer, women's health, pain and addiction. The challenge
faced by the centers--and by Jonas--is to get epidemiologists,
microbiologists and clinical investigators to work alongside alternative
practitioners whose view of the natural world does not necessarily fit
within the framework of scientific rationalism.

<P>This extrascientific perspective was in evidence at a recent meeting
at the NIH of the OAM advisory council--a group of alternative-medicine
advocates as well as mainstream researchers. There, council member
Beverly Rubik, an expert in bioelectromagnetic fields, asked a
researcher who had just reported the results of an acupuncture study
whether he had taken into account the variable of "external chi"--in
other words, did he evaluate the levels of vital energy circulating in
the environment around the subjects of the study? Jonas himself believes
that researching alternative methods might require an open-mindedness
that some scientists and physicians would characterize as naive,
gullible or simply wrongheaded.

<P>In his book, although he acknowledges that homeopathic effects might
be placebo-induced, he is also willing to entertain a number of other
explanations for why these approaches work: the transfer of a patient's
"unhealthy" electric field to the remedy by the coupling of "biophotons"
or the ability of thoughts to "nudge potential effects into existence."
His acceptance of these claims as worthy of study leaves critics aghast.
"What's happening here is that ancient religious practices are being
dressed up with New Age technobabble," remarks Robert L. Park, a
physicist at the University of Maryland and a frequent critic of the
OAM--one whose views probably reflect those of most establishment
scientists.

<P>Jonas's openness could undercut the credibility of the OAM's
findings. And despite his seeming administrative prowess, Jonas has
little experience managing an ambitious research endeavor. He has never
directed a large program and, except for literature reviews, has almost
no published research of his own. His main research training came during
a yearlong stint from 1990 to 1991 at the Walter Reed Army Institute of
Research. "One year in a laboratory does not a researcher make,"
comments Carol A. Nacy, executive vice president for the biotechnology
firm EntreMed. Nacy formerly supervised the laboratory at Walter Reed in
which Jonas worked.

<P>At Walter Reed, Jonas tried to pursue his interest in alternative
medicine. He performed a study that purportedly showed that a
homeopathically prepared solution of pathologic bacteria produced
immunelike protective effects in mice; three immunology journals
rejected the ensuing paper. Nacy and another manager at Walter Reed
declined to add their names to Jonas's report. "I couldn't find a
rationale for why it worked," Nacy says. "We told him," she adds, "that
there are many ways to do science, and the most difficult way is to try
to prove the rationality of a discredited scientific endeavor. To do so,
you'll always be swimming upstream."

<P>In response, Jonas stands firm in defending his pursuits. The search
through what he calls "fringe ideas," he says, is justified because it
holds the promise of bringing forth new types of knowledge that might
transform science. He adds that no researcher would have the breadth of
knowledge to encompass all the areas that fall under the OAM's purview.
His job, he emphasizes, is to fulfill the office's mandate of acquiring
the outside expertise to build a solid collaboration between the
mainstream and the alternative-research communities.

<P>Even those who question Jonas's methods do not doubt the sincerity of
his motivation. Skeptical superiors at Walter Reed acknowledged Jonas's
desire to provide patients with better care. Nacy remembers that Jonas
would often volunteer to minister to the needs of anyone in the
laboratory who had taken sick. Some people even took him on as a family
physician.

<P>Jonas's attraction to unconventional healing practices stems from
nostalgia for a more compassionate interaction between physician and
patient, the antithesis of the managed-care ethos. "People get treated
today as if they're a disease or an organ," Jonas says of
high-technology medicine. But whether Jonas and the OAM will be able to
humanize medicine by conducting studies on vanishingly dilute solutions
of elemental sulfur, poison ivy and bushmaster snake is far less
certain.

<center><H1>WORKING IN A VACUUM</H1></center>

<I>by Shawn Carlson</I>

<P>There's no way around it. Sooner or later, every serious amateur needs a
vacuum system. Vacuums are crucial if you ever want to experiment with particle
beams or make your own optical filters or radiometers, to name a few projects.
The systems, however, have a reputation for being complex and costly,
discouraging many amateurs from bringing vacuum techniques into their
laboratories. But this need not be the case. Vacuum systems adequate for many
scientific needs can be easily built and inexpensively maintained. Here's how to
construct a system capable of achieving pressures as low as one ten-millionth of
an atmosphere.

<P>When it comes to vacuum vessels, think small. Low volumes are easier to seal
and pump down. A smooth glass canning jar (having no designs, artwork or
scratches, which can weaken the glass) makes an adequate chamber for the vacuum.
From a scrap-metal yard, purchase a one-inch-thick aluminum plate to serve as a
base. It should be larger than the jar's lid. Secure the lid to the base plate
with a generous helping of aluminized epoxy. (If your local hardware stores don't
carry it, call <A HREF="http://www.netherlandrubber.com/">Devcon</A> in Danvers, Mass., at 508-777-1100, for the nearest
distributor.) The epoxy should ooze out evenly from around the lid when the lid
is pressed into place under the weight of a few old books. Wipe away the excess
and let the epoxy set.

<P>Next, drill a hole one quarter inch in diameter through the center of the lid
and the base plate. If possible, tap the hole to give it threads. Obtain a
one-quarter-inch-wide threaded pipe from a hardware store. Coat its threads with
epoxy, then screw it through the bottom of the base plate. If you can't tap the
hole, just glue in an unthreaded pipe. Draw a bead of epoxy around the pipe as it
is inserted to make sure the gap is completely filled with epoxy.

<P>Cut a half-inch-wide hole in an old card table and rest the base plate on the
table so that the pipe hangs down through the hole. The pipe's end should be
about 10 inches from the floor. If the pipe's end has threads, cut them off and
file the edge smooth.

<P>Canning jars are designed to hold a vacuum, so you will most likely be able to
screw the jar right into its lid. If you need pressures approaching 10 millionths
of an atmosphere, you may want to take special precautions against tiny leaks.
You can place a layer of Teflon tape (check your local hardware store) over the
threads on the jar's lip before screwing it in. It may be necessary first to put
a bead of vacuum grease along the rim of the jar's mouth to ensure an airtight
seal. The grease is available from Duniway Stockroom Corporation in Mountain
View, Calif. (800-446-8811 or 415-969-8811).

<P>Precautions are needed in case the jar implodes. (It eventually will if you
conduct enough vacuum experiments or if the jar has some structural weakness.) On
implosion, small glass fragments could hurtle out at nearly the speed of sound!
It is therefore absolutely vital that you always keep your vessel under a
protective shield whenever you pump it down. If you don't need to see inside, a
doubled pillowcase affords the necessary protection. Otherwise, cover the jar
with a clear, thick-walled plastic container, such as a three-liter plastic
soft-drink bottle with its neck cut off. Additionally, <A HREF="http://www.aceglass.com/">Ace Glass</A> in Vineland,
N.J. (800-223-4524 or 609-692-3333; catalogue no. 13100-10), sells a protective
plastic coating that will hold the glass together in case of a catastrophe. Half
a liter will run you about $28 and is well worth the cost for the protection. Use
it in addition to, not in lieu of, a shield.

<P>For many applications, sorption pumps are the vehicles of choice for creating
a good vacuum. They have no moving parts; instead they work by chilling a type of
substance, called a sorbent, to a temperature at which it absorbs gases.
Activated charcoal works, but a molecular sieve is better. Molecular sieves are
little pellets with so many microscopic nooks and crannies that they have
fantastically large surface areas; a one-gram pellet may have more than 1,000
square meters of surface.

<P><IMG SRC="IMG/amsci2.gif" ALIGN=right hspace=15 WIDTH="262" HEIGHT="275" BORDER="0">
<br clear=all><BR><FONT SIZE="-1">Credit: Bryan Christie</FONT>
<P><center><B>HEATING THE MOLECULAR SIEVE</B> drives off <BR>any moisture in the pellets.</center>

<P>When chilled, air molecules get caught in these microchasms. A 50-gram supply
can pump a one-liter volume down to 10 millitorr in 20 minutes. (Atmospheric
pressure is about 760 torr.) Half a gallon of molecular sieve from Duniway
Stockroom sells for about $35.

<P>To hold the sorbent, you need to obtain a Pyrex bulb approximately one inch in
diameter and three and a half inches long, with a one-quarter-inch glass tube
neck. A local glassblowing shop will probably make you one for less than $30.
Fill it with the sorbent, then stuff in a little glass wool on top to keep the
molecular sieve in place. Over the neck of the glass tube, slip a short length of
flexible tubing, called Tygon tubing (check your local hardware store).

<P>Before it can be used, the molecular sieve must first be activated--that is,
it must be baked. Wrap the bulb with heating tape, available from <A HREF="http://www.wateronline.com/storefronts/omega.html">Omega
Engineering</A> in Stamford, Conn. (800-826-6342 or 203-359-1660; model no.
FGS0031-010). The 12-inch-long piece sells for $20. Or cannibalize an old toaster
for its heating element. In either case, be sure that the heater does not cross
over itself and that all of it touches the bulb. Wire in a dimmer switch to
control the temperature of the heater.

<P>To monitor the temperature, use a <A HREF="http://www.wateronline.com/storefronts/omega.html">thermocouple</A> probe (Omega, model no.
5TC-GG-J-30-36, $33) wired to a digital voltmeter. Place the probe against the
bulb between windings of the heating tape and then wrap the bulb with aluminum
foil. Safely secure the bulb so that the neck points downward and turn on the
current. Adjust the current so that the voltage from the thermocouple increases
by 18 millivolts, the signal that the sieve has reached the correct baking
temperature of 350 degrees Celsius. The heat drives off the trapped molecules,
including water vapor, which will condense on the bulb's neck and drip out. Leave
the heater on until the neck is completely dry. Turn off the heater and pinch off
the Tygon tubing to prevent the sieve from absorbing moisture from the air while
the bulb cools. And you're ready to connect it to your vessel.

<P>You will need to chill the sorbent with liquid nitrogen. Don't worry--liquid
nitrogen is inexpensive (less than $1 per liter) and easy to obtain (try the
Yellow Pages under "Welder's Supplies"). It can be safely handled if you exercise
some common sense. Store it in a large plastic drink cooler--10 liters will last
a weekend. Make sure the container does not have a spigot at the bottom. Do not
put the lid on tight, or else pressure from the boiling nitrogen will build up
inside and burst the container.

<P>To pump the air out of the canning jar, immerse the Pyrex bulb in the liquid
nitrogen. The molecular sieve will suck the air out of the glass chamber,
producing a vacuum as low as 10 millitorr.

<P>A few hints. Thoroughly wash and dry the vacuum-vessel assembly before using
it, making certain not to touch the inside with your fingers. I'm told that a
fingerprint can outgas (evaporate under low pressure) for years if not removed.
To drive off moisture, bake the vessel above 100 degrees C for an hour. The epoxy
will also outgas, as will any plastic seals in the lid of the canning jar and any
coating on the inside of the lid. Minimize the surface area of these materials
exposed to the vacuum. If more than about one square centimeter of any of the
materials is exposed, consider coating it with vacuum grease, which outgases at a
much lower rate.

<P>You can insert a vacuum gauge between the sorption pump and vessel. To measure
pressure in the tens of millitorr range, you'll want a thermocouple gauge or a
Pirani gauge. These devices exploit the fact that the thermal conductivity of a
gas drops sharply from a constant at about one torr to essentially zero at one
millitorr. You can purchase a complete thermocouple gauge from <A HREF="http://www.lesker.com/">Kurt J. Lesker
Company</A> in Clairton, Pa. (call 800-245-1656 or 412-233-4200) for about $200. The
electronically inclined can save about $150 by buying a type 531 thermocouple
vacuum tube for $45 (part no. KJL5311) and then building a simple power supply
and amplifier circuit. Pirani gauges, however, are much more versatile and are
quite easy and inexpensive to build. I'll describe how to do that next month.

<P><HR>As a service to <I>Scientific American</I> readers, the Society for Amateur
Scientists is offering a complete sorption pump kit, including a Pyrex flask
packed with a molecular sieve, heating tape, a small liquid-nitrogen holder and
Tygon tubing. A vacuum vessel is not included. The cost is $60 for domestic
orders, $70 for international ones (shipping included). This offer expires
September 30, 1997.

experiments and the best amateur science quarterly I've seen.

<P><B>Editors' note:</B> In the power-supply circuit schematic in "Detecting
Micron-Size Movements" [August], the lower integrated-circuit chip is incorrectly
identified as a type 7805. It should be a type 7905. The upper chip is correct.

<center><H2>MISTAKES WERE MADE</H2>

Review by John Adams</center>

<P>THE LOGIC OF FAILURE: WHY THINGS GO WRONG AND WHAT WE CAN DO TO MAKE THEM RIGHT
<BR><I>by Dietrich D&#246;rner. Henry Holt and Company, 1996 (originally published in German in 1989) ($25)</I>

<P>WHY THINGS BITE BACK: TECHNOLOGY AND THE REVENGE OF UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES 
<BR><I>by Edward Tenner. Alfred A. Knopf, 1996 ($26)</I>

<P>Perhaps the human race carries a gene for hubris. The history of
technology, since the time of Icarus's ill-fated aviation project, is
littered with accounts of Man (it usually is the males) overreaching
himself. Accidents happen, and after nearly every major one there is an
inquest. With the benefit of hindsight, it is usually possible to
identify the human error, or chain of errors, that caused things to go
wrong. Most of the voluminous literature on risk management--with a few
exceptions, such as that aimed at venture capitalists--is devoted to
picking over the bones of past accidents and drawing lessons to ensure
that those particular mistakes can never happen again. It is a
frustrated literature. Things continue to go wrong, and there is little
evidence that we are learning from this catalogue of mishap and
disaster. Dietrich D&#246;rner's book demonstrates why.

<P><I>The Logic of Failure</I> is a prescriptive book, and not a modest
one: D&#246;rner sets out a five-step "schema for the entire problem-solving
process." Address the tasks laid out in each step, and whatever problem
is at hand will be solved in the most effective possible way. Or so one
might wish.

<P>First, D&#246;rner states, "We need to have clear goals in mind." Here is
the initial problem; rarely can individuals, let alone societies, define
clearly what they want. We are ambivalent. No one wants an accident, but
everyone appears to want to be free to take risks. And risks, by
definition, carry the possibility of adverse outcomes.

<P>Second, according to D&#246;rner's schema, we must have a model. "Can we
as citizens," he asks, "ever have a complete understanding of the
issues?" The answer is, clearly, "No," but he presses on: "Once we have
acquired enough information about a situation and have formed a model
that fits this information together, we should be in a position to
assess not only the status quo but also developments likely to follow
from the current situation." Perhaps we "should be," but we never are;
prediction routinely founders on inadequate information.

<P>Fourth comes planning, decision and action--activities that D&#246;rner
acknowledges to be challenging: "Decision making," he observes, "is
rarely an easy task," and "action is a difficult enterprise." The final
step is review and revision: "We must be prepared to acknowledge that a
solution is not working." Who could disagree with such an obvious
conclusion?

<P>D&#246;rner illustrates his prescriptions mostly by showing what happens
when people apparently fail to follow them. In one study, he and his
colleagues gave participants dictatorial powers to run "Tanaland," an
imaginary nation somewhere in the Sahel. They controlled key variables
such as infrastructure provision, medical care and birth control, water
and irrigation and agricultural methods. Most participants produced
simulated catastrophic famine, because their initial successes generated
increases in the human and cattle populations that soon overran
resources. D&#246;rner's analysis of these failures smugly presumes that the
developers of the computer simulation knew the "right answer" and that
their model was sufficiently realistic to constitute a fair test of the
participants' risk-management abilities. In fact, the study used a
simplistic Malthusian model certain to trip up players who did not share
the pessimism that was built into the game.

<P>When a Grand Prix driver has an accident, is it because he made a
mistake or simply because he was unlucky? D&#246;rner would almost certainly
answer that someone--a member of the pit crew, a competitor, the car or
track designer, the driver himself--made an error. As a result of that
attitude, he litters his book with impossible platitudes guaranteed to
bring a wry smile to the face of a racer entering a chicane or to anyone
else who must make a decision without adequate information--which is all
of us most of the time: "We must learn to cope with side effects";
"Taking the middle path between clinging stubbornly to a doomed plan and
giving up a fundamentally good one is not easy. Finding this path,
though, will give us greater chances for success."

<P>How can anyone manage these tricks in a nonlinear world characterized
by conflicting values and populated by billions of people acting on one
another and on their environment--and in the process constantly changing
one another and the world? D&#246;rner's ultimate answer is a bit lame: "What
matters is not, I think, development of exotic mental capabilities....
There is only one thing that does in fact matter, and that is the
development of our common sense."

<P><I>Why Things Bite Back</I> is a refreshing antidote to such earnest
risk-management orthodoxy. Edward Tenner has a keen nose for paradox and
irony and a very different idea of common sense. Given the catalogue of
errors that serves as his subject matter, he is remarkably
cheerful--partly, I suspect, because he is one of nature's optimists and
partly because like most of us he enjoys what happens when pomposity
steps on a banana skin.

<P>Although he presumably has not read <I>The Logic of Failure</I> (it
was published in German in 1989, but the English translation has just
been released), Tenner provides an excellent implicit critique of it. He
shows that our inability to articulate clear goals for the management of
risk is found even in sport, where arguments rage over the use of new
equipment and techniques that could improve safety and performance. It
is possible, for example, to devise procedures that permit mountaineers
to achieve the summit of a particular peak with less risk than before,
but many climbers resist "improvements" that diminish demands on their
skill.

<P>Things tend to "bite back" whenever we interfere with them in
ignorance--the state, Tenner amply demonstrates, in which the real world
usually compels us to operate. The same is true, only more so, of our
attempts to anticipate the future. Tenner devotes three chapters to
describing the way that insect pests bite back, often literally, when
nature's rules turn out to be much more complex than those understood by
the pests' would-be controllers.

<P>Tenner has enjoyable sport with the hubris implicit in calls for
perfect planning. Where D&#246;rner endorses a goal of gathering information
that will lead to an accurate model of future events, Tenner invokes
Paul Valry to telling effect: "Unpredictability in every field is the
result of the conquest of the whole world by scientific power. This
invasion by active knowledge tends to transform man's environment and
man himself--to what extent, with what risks, what deviations from the
basic conditions of existence and of the preservation of life we simply
do not know. Life has become, in short, the object of an experiment of
which we can say only one thing--that it tends to estrange us more and
more from what we were, or what we think we are, and that it is leading
us...we do not know and can by no means imagine where."

<P>Tenner covers an impressive range of "revenge effects" and shows
convincingly that unintended and undesired consequences are the norm
whenever new technologies are introduced: the revolution that now
permits information to be stored and transported electronically has
produced a proliferation of paper. Flood-control work by the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers has actually increased the damage caused by floods.
Helmets and other protective gear help to make football more dangerous
than rugby. Roads designed to relieve congestion are themselves clogged
with traffic. Clear, straight roads often have the highest fatality
rates.

<P>The more that we introduce conspicuous safety measures, Tenner
argues, the greater becomes the likelihood of a <I>Titanic</I>-style
disaster in which "belief in the safety of the ship [becomes] the
greatest single hazard to the survival of its passengers."

<P>Why can't we use reason to stamp out failure? Why do things bite
back? The brief answer appears to be that "things" are densely
interconnected. Whenever we intervene to change one specific item, we
set in motion innumerable other changes. Risk and uncertainty are
therefore inescapable.

<P>Perhaps the single most effective thing that we can do to improve our
luck is to devise ways of ensuring that the people responsible for
sweeping changes in the world (or any small part of it) are in the front
line when it comes to suffering the unintended consequences of their
actions. The irony at the heart of both books, vainly resisted by D&#246;rner
but thoroughly embraced by Tenner, is one appreciated more than 100
years ago by Herbert Spencer: "The ultimate result of shielding men from
the effects of folly is to fill the world with fools."

<CENTER><H2>BEING MEDICAL</H2>

Review by Sherwin B. Nuland</center>

<P>LIFE AFTER MEDICAL SCHOOL
<BR><I>by Leonard Laster. W. W. Norton, 1996 ($27.50)</I>

<P>A few months ago I received a telephone call typical of many that I
and other doctors have grown used to. A medical school junior had become
infatuated--that is the only word to describe the intensity of her
enchantment--with the idea of entering a training program in my
specialty. As I listened to this intelligent young woman describe the
aesthetic intensity of touch and sight that are the core of a surgeon's
working life, I remembered the magnetizing influence those very
qualities had held for me at a similar stage of my own professional
education. I also knew well--as she anticipated--the personal
satisfaction of witnessing the direct, curative outcome of one's
handiwork.

<P>But after more than 30 years of a busy career, I recognized that I
would have to temper the student's newfound fascination and tell her of
the sometimes harsh realities of a surgeon's daily portion. Joseph
Campbell's pop philosophy notwithstanding, I have seen more than one
young person follow an ill-considered bliss right up the garden path,
whether in matters of work or of the heart.

<P>I interrupted the cavalcade of enthusiastic adjectives rolling
through the receiver to speak of the rigors of training, the constant
urgencies of the surgeon's life and their effect on a family. I made the
point that precisely the solo responsibility that brings such
satisfaction when things go well becomes the source of much gnashing of
teeth when it does not. Adding to this tension is the fact that in many
cases a surgeon must make crucial decisions about diagnosis and
treatment before all necessary evidence is available--the internist's
leisure to contemplate is too often absent.

<P>I told my caller to speak to other surgeons, to visit training
programs at several different schools and to look carefully at other
specialties. Throughout our long conversation, I found myself wishing
for a single published volume I might recommend, one in which the
experiences of many specialties were condensed, compared and contrasted.
I know my own field of medicine well but cannot speak authoritatively
about alternatives.

<P>Those of us who have received more than a few of these calls (and
those who crave the insights of practitioners in the medical field) can
now relax, at least a little. <I>Life after Medical School, </I>compiled
by Leonard Laster, an internist and chancellor emeritus of the
University of Massachusetts Medical Center, is a collection of 32
interviews of experienced physicians who have spent their careers in a
particular specialty or in some offshoot of a medical career. It should
help guide the aspiring student, and it may also provide useful
understanding of the variety of medical experience for nonphysicians.

<P>Laster's subjects tell us about the background that made them choose
their fields, their experiences in training and practice, and their
reflections on the decades of work. He has assembled a remarkably mixed
group: some of them are academics, some in private practice, some are
superspecialists and others are in primary care. They are black, white,
male, female, married and single, born to wealth or raised in poverty.
Laster chose his interlocutors--friends, professional acquaintances or
simply interesting physicians--not so much for prominence as for the
wide range of the tales they tell. We read comments from the former
editor of the <I>New England Journal of Medicine</I> and from a former
U.S. surgeon general. We also learn about the careers of a general
practitioner in a small town in Massachusetts, an internist caring for
homeless patients in Baltimore and a salaried ophthalmologist working
for an HMO in Oregon. Several physicians' interests led them far afield:
one now runs a major corporation, and another oversees a charitable
foundation. A third is governor of the state of Vermont.

<P>In addition to explaining the reasons that they chose one specialty
over others, Laster's contributors have described why they ruled out
certain career choices. This information is almost equally important.
One urologist, for example, abandoned the idea of neurosurgery after
doing duty with a potential mentor who embodied the opposite of almost
everything the younger man wanted to be as a doctor. A radiologist and
an anesthesiologist both abandoned other specialties after realizing
that their healing talents did not include direct interaction with
patients.

<P>Within this diversity, all these doctors have a few things in
common--most clearly, their love of the art of healing. Without
exception, they agree that the medical life is both useful to society
and the source of great personal rewards. Although such attitudes are
not surprising in a group that has been found worthy of interviewing for
posterity, it does provide a good  counterpoint to the widespread media
coverage of doctors' dissatisfaction with their profession.

<P>Although a book like this calls out to be read in its entirety, I
must attach a caveat to that recommendation. Laster has constructed each
chapter by transferring a long interview from speech to print; the
result is a set of monologues all delivered--despite the differences
among the speakers--in a single voice. The reader may soon grow tired of
"listening" to one contributor after another "speaking" at the same pace
and with the same inflections in the transcribed and Laster-edited
sentences. Although the effort is more than repaid by the broad view of
the medical landscape a reader attains, the book is very difficult to
read in long sittings.

<P>This volume is no medical <I>Arabian Nights;</I> still, Laster
introduces such a sympathetic group of personalities doing work of such
a high degree of intrinsic interest that the end of each chapter only
stimulates the reader to brave the stylistic tedium and go on. <I>Life
after Medical School </I>will be of immense help to my young caller and
to countless others in and out of medicine. I have already phoned her
with the advice to buy her own copy, because I will be needing mine when
the next student calls.

<P><I>SHERWIN B. NULAND teaches surgery and the history of medicine at
Yale University. He is the author of </I>How We Die, <I>which won the
National Book Award for nonfiction in 1994.</I>

<P><B>I MAY BE SOME TIME: ICE AND THE ENGLISH IMAGINATION, </B>
<BR><I>by Francis Spufford. Faber and Faber, 1996 ($24.95).</I>

<P>Captain Oates's famous last words before perishing in the Antarctic
("I'm just going outside, and I may be some time") have set Francis
Spufford off on a lyrical rumination on the meaning and mythology of the
icy unknown--in science and in literature, in high society and in the
attitudes of the masses. The result is a wholly original concoction.
British fantasies of Eskimo life, the denouement of <I>Frankenstein</I>
and the bizarre hollow-earth theory of John Cleves Symmes blend together
naturally into a kind of neo-Victorian poetry.


<a name="empire"></a>
<P><HR><B>EMPIRE OF LIGHT, </B>
<BR><I>by Sidney Perkowitz. Henry Holt and
Company, 1996 ($25).</I>

<P>Using light as a unifying theme, Sidney Perkowitz roams widely
through classical and modern physics, the nature of vision, optics,
cosmology and fine art. The author displays an obvious love of breaking
down the boundaries between disciplines; artists and scientists alike
may discover some intriguing new personalities in the course of reading
this book. The trade-off is a superficiality that erodes the subtlety
behind some of the scientific anecdotes and reduces a few sections to
little more than name-dropping.

<a name="germs"></a>
<P><HR><B>A FIELD GUIDE TO GERMS, </B>
<BR><I>by Wayne Biddle. Anchor Books, 1996
($12.95).</I>

<P>Some are deadly, others crucial to sustaining modern life. Wayne
Biddle leads the reader from adenoviruses to Zika fever, with more than
five dozen stops along the way, including <I>Clostridium botulinum</I>
(from the Latin <I>botulus, </I>"small sausage," the food once most
likely to harbor the microbe's highly lethal neurotoxin). Given the high
price of even this paperback version, however, far too few people will
enjoy this lively book.

<a name="weather"></a>
<P><HR><B>WEATHER: DRAMA OF THE HEAVENS, </B>
<BR><I>by Ren&#233; Chaboud. Translated
by I. Mark Paris. Harry N. Abrams, 1996 ($12.95).</I>

<P>This unpretentious book packs a lot of glossy illustrations and
basics of weather research into a pocket-size format. The translation
from French has left behind an odd mix of English and metric units, but
the text itself could hardly be clearer. The extensive marginalia
(captions, quotes, anecdotes) encourage random browsing; a further
reading section provides useful grist for those whose interest grows
past the book's intentionally limited depth.

<a name="piltdown"></a>
<P><HR><B>UNRAVELING PILTDOWN, </B>
<BR><I>by John Evangelist Walsh. Random
House, 1996 ($25).</I>

<P>The famous Piltdown man fossils excited and confounded
paleontologists until they were exposed as fakes in 1953. The question
ever since has been, Who perpetrated this elaborate fraud? John Walsh
frames the story as a very entertaining whodunit. Disputing several
recent theories, he points the finger back at the most obvious culprit:
Charles Dawson, the amateur fossil hunter who allegedly discovered the
bones. The wrap-up is unsurprising and unsatisfying, however, as Walsh
supplies no persuasive motive and uncovers no smoking gun.

<a name="darwin"></a>
<P><HR><B>CHARLES DARWIN'S LETTERS: A SELECTION, </B>
<BR><I>edited by Frederick Burkhardt. Cambridge
University Press, 1996 ($21.95).</I>

<P>These letters, culled from the seven-volume <I>Correspondence of
Charles Darwin</I>, span the years from Darwin's student days to the
publication of <I>On the Origin of Species</I> in 1859. There are some
revealing personal insights, such as his battle with seasickness on
board the H.M.S. <I>Beagle, </I>but high drama is not much in evidence.
The real draw is the meticulous way the letters tell the inside story of
Darwin's energetic, 22-year quest for evidence in support of his theory
of evolution through natural selection.

<FONT SIZE=+2>WONDERS</font>

<BR>by <B>Philip Morrison</B>          

<H2>NEW WORLD AND OLD: <BR>A MATTER OF MAGNITUDE</H2>

Scientists and engineers map their world in numbers, a form of
expression that is as colorless as it is information-rich. Common speech
(apart from age, time and the arresting topic of money) hardly uses
numbers. Speech does draw its distinctions of quantity--few or many,
cheap or dear--but oddly enough, words rarely part any range into more
than three categories.

<P>One instructive exception is the list of six nouns that are used for
natural rock fragments: silt, sand, gravel, pebbles, cobbles, boulders.
Although most of these are everyday terms, they have been given
standardized meaning among geologists. Still, you don't have to be a
sediment scientist to grasp how much fine silt differs from big boulders
in a mountain stream. The words offer understanding over a scale of size
that extends a millionfold.

<P>Two terms that scale not space but time are quite widely used, the
New World and the Old World. They record the European surprise when 500
years ago the newly emboldened voyagers found an inhabited continent
that barred the seaway westward to the distant shores of the wealthy
Emperor of Cathay. In truth, each side then found that the other was new
enough. Novelty was fully reciprocal: the ruins that dot Eternal Rome
are not a bit older than those that awaited the Aztec entry to the
Valley of Mexico. The long-term consequences of conquest did not divide
an American New World from a Eurasian Old World, as we sometimes
imagine, but instead linked them tightly, for good and for ill.

<P>What endures is the fascinating fact that for human beings our
Americas are really new; the wider landmasses of Africa, Europe and Asia
are factually very much older, not in their rocks, but in human
experience. The true distinction between Old and New has nothing much to
do with the modern story of Admiral Columbus or even of lucky Leif a
mere thousand years before him, but rather with the chronology of our
prehistory. The protohuman evolutionary timescale can be set roughly but
firmly at some few million years, 100 times as old as Niagara Falls or
Great Salt Lake. We fix that long time not only by dating a few
excavations but by a diverse range of concurrent, datable fossil
markers, from the bones of extinct saber-toothed cats, cave bears and
odd little mice to multiple layers of volcanic ash and pollen, in valley
walls as deeply eroded as Olduvai in East Africa.

<P>The evidence of protohumanity lies within four corners of the Old
World: the shores of the North Sea, the Cape of Good Hope, the
southeastern tip of Java's island chain and north beyond the Great Wall
of China. Scores of excavations over that entire wide hemisphere have
shown us worked stones, old hearths and skeletal remains, all left by
our ancient forebears. They were not yet members of our own species, but
they are ancestral kinfolk of our own genus, the hominids, in all those
places.

<P>Across the Americas we can point out scrupulous excavations in plenty
to show who came here to the New World. A score of sites are found from
the Bering Sea south to the region of the Straits of Magellan. None
bears any witness to protohumans at all. All those bison hunters,
spearhead shapers and cunning basket weavers whose handiwork and
physical remains have been found in these Americas are of our very own
kind, that single species we self-servingly dub <I>Homo sapiens. </I>Our
living species is proved by long experience to be a single species,
fully interfertile. By no means anything like a million years old, <I>H.
sapiens</I> might go back a tenth of that time, possibly even as much as
a third of it. Contrast those protohominid fossils of the African Rift:
famous little Lucy, our apelike ancestor there, is about 10 times the
age of any <I>sapiens </I>find anywhere.

<P>That order of magnitude carries my point. All over the globe, Old
World and New, there are no living hominids save <I>sapiens. </I>All of
us today are united by one visible anatomy and by a whole catalogue of
common blood proteins. The languages that in some way part us
nonetheless share so much that we can conclude as a first-rate working
hypothesis that language is in general, like art, a common heritage of
our species. We are unsure how much of either language or art the
earlier species had. It is sure that some of them prepared effective
tools of stone according to very slow-changing patterns and that they
sometimes occupied cave shelters. Above all some were the Prometheans
who first came bravely to know the use of fire. But the Americas are a
New World, a new place for humans. No sign of humanity is found here
anything near a million years back. The true dates remain to be fixed
firmly, but no finds here are the work of another species. Distant
Australia as well belongs to our New World of humanity. Its oldest human
remains are also those left by clever <I>sapiens, </I>our siblings. Most
oceanic islands, like the three seagirt continents, have also never felt
the tread of any ancestral species. Big Madagascar and New Zealand were
first settled by seafarers from the Pacific only a couple of millennia
past, a timescale that overlaps familiar written history.

<P>Firmer, more precise dates indeed are important--just when did the
first people come to America?--but the inference from our wealth of
loosely dated clues is fully adequate to distinguish the Old from the
New. The difference between our own species and those who came before us
has as sharp a meaning in ordinary speech as the simple terms "silt,"
"sand" and "gravel." The terms "Old World" and "New World" therefore
broadly transcend any uncertainties in the precision of dating.

<P>We can offer a plausible explanation. Primates are land animals. Even
now, at any moment, not as many as one human out of 1,000 is to be found
afloat or aloft. Those ancestral folk could not cross the seas during
their million years of foraging afoot. The New World was reached
overseas only after the eventual appearance of a dynamic younger
species, our very own. It was only the sapient men and women who
journeyed a couple of hundred centuries ago along icy coasts and inland
valleys. So much water was locked ashore as glacial ice that the level
of the high seas dropped by hundreds of feet, and many islands were for
a while part of the main. A few daring sea passages probably demanded
the mastery of sailing canoe or raft.

<P>The remoter islands and the coasts of distant Antarctica were left
unvisited until explorers could arrive under big sails. Both ends of the
earth's axis remained for the 20th century itself as icy adventures by
foot and by sledge. At last our own kind has spread over all the
habitable lands, in both the Old and New Worlds.

<H2>MAKING YOUR MARK</H2>

I was watching the news the other night when I saw a story about
somebody being identified by the so-called DNA-fingerprinting technique.
On the screen were the now familiar black-and-white bands you're
starting to see in all the cops and robbers movies. Back in the 1930s,
it was the Swedish Nobel laureate Arne Tiselius who made all this fun
possible. He worked out how to make protein molecules line up according
to size, by putting them in a gel that he then zapped with various
charges. Electrophoresis.

<P>The hardly visible differences in the gel (caused by the migrating
proteins) were more easily seen with Schlieren photography. With it, the
slightest variations in density show up (because of changes in the
refractive index) in a transparent medium such as a protein-loaded gel.
Or turbulent air. Which is why, right from the start, the Schlieren
method was also a great success with airflow freaks such as Theodor von
Krmn, whose vortices you'll sometimes see curling away, like streaks
of fog, from the wings of an airplane taking off on a damp day.

<P>Both von K. and his streaks were well known to a pal of his, A.H.G.
Fokker, of the planes of the same name. But Fokker did something else
besides build great flying machines that would first cross the U.S.
nonstop in 1926 and in the same year take Byrd first over the North
Pole.

<P>During World War I, Fokker worked out a clever way to synchronize a
propeller with a machine gun, so fighter aces wouldn't shoot their own
props off. All you had to do with this new system was point the plane
and fire. The arrangement was so successful (particularly in the hands
of such hotshots as Manfred von Richthofen, the Red Baron, in his red
Fokker) that it became known as "the Fokker scourge." At the time,
machine guns were doing well on the ground, too. Especially against
thousands of infantry snagged on barbed wire during advances. Sitting
ducks, really.

<P>The amazing new invention called the tank was supposed to prevent
this, by crawling over (and knocking down) the barbed wire, thus
clearing a path for the troops. Irony was, that the tanks got taken over
by cavalry regiments. The majority of the horses had been requisitioned
from rural America for transport regiments in Europe, to haul supplies
(to the men who were now <I>also</I> missing from the farms). Which
caused the invention in the first place.

<P>Back in California, the shortage of horsepower and man power had
inspired a farmer named Ben Holt to invent an entirely new kind of
agricultural implement. Holt lived in the San Joaquin Valley, where a
lot of the land was so wet it wouldn't support anything on wheels (or in
some cases, hooves). He came up with a crawler tractor that ran on
tracks as it spread the load. A friend remarked that it looked like a
caterpillar, and the rest is farm-equipment history.

<P>Most of the early Holt tractors got sold to the Allies during the
war, which is how the military saw them and--bingo--came up with tanks.
The tractors ran on gasoline, but later Holt switched to the diesel
(after Rudolf Diesel) engine, which itself was so successful because it
was cheaper to run than gasoline engines and could start cold. Also,
people thought it would burn almost any junk for fuel; there was even
one that ran on peanut oil. It may have been this last selling point
that won Diesel his financial backing from the outset. Because right
from the start, when talking to anybody about his engine, he used the
magic word "coal."

<P>It was how the engine worked that made such talk possible. With a
diesel, all you do is compress air in a cylinder so its temperature goes
up to near 800 degrees Celsius. At the top of the piston stroke, when
the air is hottest, you inject a suitable liquid, gas or particulate.
Just the heat of the air causes it to combust, which pushes the piston
down and starts the cycle all over again. So the diesel looked as if
it'd burn anything that--well--burned. Like coal dust. In 1897 this
sounded like sweet music to a man who had a great deal of the stuff. And
so it would to you, if you ran the biggest steel plant in Europe and the
railways and, to top it off, owned all the coal mines that went with
this way of making money. In Friedrich Krupp's case, a lot of money.

<P>Not surprisingly, Friedrich's father, Alfred, who'd brought the firm
to greatness earlier in the century, was less than keen on the new wind
of Socialism sweeping through the industrial world just then. For him it
meant social anarchy. So he devised ways to keep his workers happy
enough not to want such inconveniences as trade unions. He gave them
canteens, pensions, housing, company discount stores and even uniforms
to wear at home (what would you expect from a guy who once said: "As
pants the deer for cooling streams, so do I for regulation"?).

<P>Such a "welfare" scheme (as well as his love of trees and dislike of
company) bonded him with the chap running Prussia at the time. This
person was, I suppose, regulation personified. Otto von Bismarck (also
an antisocial tree lover) and Krupp were meant for each other. After
all, Otto made war and Alfred made guns. Bismarck was also keen on
welfare (he started the first universal old-age pension) and statistics
and such, because the more numbers you had on all the average joes out
there in the streets, the better you could regulate people so as to
increase national output (or fight wars). Bismarck had developed this
passion for the average joe because Ernst Engel, the head of the
Prussian Statistical Bureau, greatly admired the Belgian astronomer who
had <I>invented</I> the average joe.

<P>Here's how. In 1835 Brussels, Lambert Adolphe Qu&#233;telet modified
the kind of math that astronomers used to calculate the probable path of
rarely sighted heavenly bodies to do the same thing for population
statistics. He believed if you applied this math to large numbers of
people you could develop what he called "social physics." This way, you
could work out what the average joe was up to and do statistically
meaningful sampling. Well, this was better than previous methods (like
multiplying the number of chimneys by an assumed average family size to
get the population), so it attracted the interest of such mathematical
biggies as Charles Babbage.

<P>Babbage's involvement with Qu&#233;telet led to the formation of
statistical societies in Britain and eventually motivated a young man
called Francis Galton to go looking for ways in which any individual
could be singled out from the masses. The result of his work was the
discovery of a surefire way to differentiate one person from another,
known as the fingerprint. Which was, until the advent of the DNA version
I saw on TV the other night, the ultimate ID.

<P>P.S. Ironically, given how valuable electrophoresis was to prove in
the original discovery of DNA, guess who Galton's cousin was? Charles
Darwin.

<BR>In the classic science-fiction movie <A HREF="http://us.imdb.com/M/title-exact?forbidden%20planet"><I>Forbidden Planet</I></A>, space
travelers from Earth land on a distant world, where they encounter the
remnants of a technologically advanced civilization. Remarkably, the
human visitors are able to communicate with one of the alien computers
that is still functioning. Connected through glowing head probes, the
men's thoughts and feelings are directly conveyed to the machine over a
neural link.

<P>Many similar examples of people having their minds coupled to
computers have appeared in other works of fiction. As often depicted, a
person simply thinks of a command, and the computer immediately
responds--a scheme analogous to the <A HREF="http://spwww.mcit.med.umich.edu/projects/voice/">computer voice recognition</A> in use
today. Thought recognition would be the ultimate computer interface, the
machine acting as an extension of the human nervous system itself.

Computer technology has advanced markedly in the 40 years since
<I>Forbidden Planet</I> was released, but constructing a versatile
neural junction between a human brain and an electronic one remains a
formidable challenge. Attempts to tie the nervous system to external
electronic circuits are, however, well worth pursuing because the
results may provide the means for effortless communication with
computers. This work is already extremely valuable to people with
devastating <A HREF="http://www.pitt.edu/%7Eneurolab/neumusc2.html">neuromuscular handicaps</A>--a group usually without access to
computers or indeed much opportunity to influence the world.

<P>Our work over the past decade has helped make such "hands free"
control of computers a reality. Neural linkages with computers can now
satisfy a variety of needs, and we expect that enterprising people will
soon find additional ways to harness this technique. A view of what the
future holds in store requires only some imagination--and a clear
understanding of how past work has led to today's accomplishments.

<P><B><A NAME="1">The Body Electric</A></B>

<P>The electrical nature of the human nervous system--the basis for
direct neural control of computers--has been recognized for more than a
century. In 1849 the German physiologist Emil Heinrich Du Bois-Reymond
first reported the detection of minute electrical discharges created by
the contraction of the muscles in his arms. He made these observations
using a primitive device for measuring voltages called a 
<A HREF="http://www.shss.montclair.edu/psychology/perera/s_thomp.gif">galvanometer</A>.
Du Bois-Reymond attached the wires of this instrument to his body using
pieces of saline-soaked blotting paper to keep electrical resistance in
the connection to a minimum. But he soon realized that the skin acted as
a barrier to the underlying muscle signals. So this dedicated researcher
induced a blister on each arm, removed the skin and placed the paper
electrodes within the wounds. Du Bois-Reymond was then able to capture
electrical signals that were about 30 times stronger than those he could
obtain with the skin intact.

<P>These early investigations built the foundation for a technique that
serves well today to monitor muscle contractions. With modern 
<A HREF="http://www.pasco.com/html-bin/computer/physsens.htm">silver
chloride electrodes</A> and sensitive electronic amplifiers, tiny muscle
impulses--even those muted by passage through the skin--provide easily
registered voltages. Medical researchers first exploited this phenomenon
during the 1970s to devise <A HREF="http://www.cs.ucla.edu/csd-grads-gs2/wingcat/public-html/prfb.html">mechanized prostheses</A> that could operate by
sensing muscle contractions. Other scientists realized that electrical
impulses from active muscle fibers could also help people who suffered
from diseases or injuries that left them too weak to move any of their
limbs: they needed only to have electrodes placed near unimpaired
muscles. Following that strategy, even profoundly handicapped
individuals can manipulate electronic equipment with the electrical
signal from muscles (called an <A HREF="http://nmrc.bu.edu/nmrc/detect/emg.htm">electromyographic signal, or EMG</A>, a name
borrowed from the term for a paper tracing of such impulses).

<P>But one cannot simply attach EMG sensors to a person's skin and plug
the wires into the back of a conventional computer. The task requires
specialized circuits and software to analyze and interpret the pattern
of muscle impulses. To aid others involved in these efforts, we have
designed equipment to serve as a general-purpose interface between a
computer and the body's various electrical signals. We dubbed our
creation the <A HREF="http://www.sni.de/public/uk_sys/whatsnew/prod2-96/biomuse.htm">Biomuse</A>.

<P>The work of translating muscle impulses to a form more appropriate
for a digital computer begins with the amplification of the raw signals
sensed by the electrodes, which increases these voltages by a factor of
about 10,000. Other circuits then convert the amplified EMG signals to
digital form. After much additional processing of these digitized
measurements, a computer can determine when muscle fibers near the
electrodes are contracting and by how much. In this way, the muscle
activity can direct the operation of a personal computer--just as one
might employ a computer mouse or trackball.

<P>Some arrangements to control computers using muscle signals have
proved particularly valuable to handicapped people. For instance, in
1993 David J. Warner, a neuroscientist at <A HREF="http://www.llu.edu/LLUMC/">Loma Linda University Medical
Center</A> in California, connected the electrodes from our EMG apparatus to
the face of a 10-year-old boy who had been completely paralyzed below
the neck in an automobile accident. By tensing certain facial muscles,
the young patient could move objects on the computer screen--the first
time since his injury that the child could manipulate a part of his
environment without aid.

<P>But people do not have to be physically impaired to benefit from the
ability of muscle signals to control a computer. We are, for example,
now experimenting with a hands-free EMG mouse. With it, a person can
adjust the position of a cursor on the screen using, for example,
forearm muscles. Such a device allows someone to move the cursor without
having to lift a hand from the keyboard.

<P><B><A NAME="2">Unrecognized Potential</A></B>

<P>Another approach to controlling computers with biological signals
depends on a completely different electrical phenomenon of the human
body: the corneal-retinal potential. This signal arises because the
retina, the site of most metabolic activity within the eye, exhibits a
slight negative voltage compared with the cornea. In a sense, the eye
acts as a weak electric battery. Electronic circuits can detect the tiny
voltage fluctuations on a person's face that arise when the eyes shift
in orientation. These impulses are called an electrooculographic signal,
or EOG (the name for recordings made of them).

<P>Measurement of EOG signals has served researchers for decades as a
convenient indicator of eye movement in various physiological studies.
In 1953, for example, <A HREF="http://bisleep.medsch.ucla.edu/htdocs/kleitman.html">Nathaniel Kleitman</A> of the University of Chicago
and Eugene Aserinsky of <A HREF="http://jeffline.tju.edu/SML/archives/history/index.html">Jefferson Medical College</A> in Philadelphia used
EOG recordings to document <A HREF="0267jouvet.html">eye movement during certain periods of sleep</A>.
These particular intervals were accompanied by intense brain activity
similar to that of the awake state, and so the investigators
distinguished this curious type of slumber by calling it
rapid-eye-movement, or <A HREF="http://www.dmv.com/%7Etom/dreams.html">REM, sleep</A>.

<P>Although investigators had previously used the EOG merely to record
the overall motion of the eyes, by the late 1980s it seemed feasible
that measurements of the corneal-retinal potential could also indicate
the direction of a person's gaze. With the proper arrangement of
electrodes, EOG voltages will vary proportionally with eye rotations
over a range of about 30 degrees from center. By 1990 several research
groups had reported some success in using this method to move a computer
cursor. Still, skeptics continued to believe that electrical "noise" in
the form of gradual changes in the voltage across the electrodes
("electrode drift") would render this approach unworkable for anything
other than a laboratory demonstration.

<P>Our efforts did, however, uncover a way to eliminate the interference
and construct a practical device for controlling computers. To
accomplish that result, we employed the same system we had used for
detecting muscle signals but this time configured the apparatus as an
EOG monitor. As with EMG processing, the EOG analyzer begins by
amplifying and digitizing the voltages obtained from several electrodes
(one pair of electrodes serves to detect vertical eye displacements;
another set indicates horizontal eye movements). The system then applies
so-called <A HREF="http://www.sciam.com/askexpert/computers.html#q1d">fuzzy logic</A> to discriminate between true eye movement and
electrode drift [see "Fuzzy Logic," by Bart Kosko and Satoru Isaka;
Scientific American, July 1993].

<P>With this equipment, a person can reliably <A HREF="http://www.diku.dk/%7Epanic/eyegaze/article.html">operate a computer with
eye movements</A>--for instance, by positioning the cursor at various points
on the screen. There are other <A HREF="http://www.diku.dk/%7Epanic/eyegaze/node8.html#SECTION0006">techniques for tracking a person's gaze</A>
that utilize infrared beams or video cameras. But EOG equipment proves
much less costly than alternative strategies, making it possible for
more people to consider using eye motion to operate computers--in
particular, as an aid for the disabled.

<P>At Loma Linda in 1991, Warner tried our eye-tracking system to help a
youngster who had sustained a serious injury to her spinal cord as an
infant. Because of her age at the time of her accident, the doctors at
the center were concerned that the girl's physical restrictions would
compromise the development of her brain. Fitted with a special EOG
headband and placed in front of a video monitor, the 18-month-old girl
quickly discovered that she could move an icon (a smiling face) about
the screen with just her eyes. She understood intuitively how to control
the display without having been told how the system worked.

<P>Other <A HREF="http://www.shepherd.org/disabl.html">institutions dedicated to the rehabilitation of paralysis
victims</A> have used similar equipment in conjunction with "visual
keyboard" software that displays a standard typewriter keyboard. Using
eye movements alone, an operator can select letters from the keys
presented on the screen. Although the process of forming words in this
way is slow, with practice (and some clever software aids) people can
complete multiple sentences, even whole documents, by a continuous
succession of glances.

<P>Tracking a person's gaze with EOG signals can be done so reliably
that a number of groups are also attempting to integrate this mechanism
in other settings. For instance, we have collaborated with physicians
from Stanford University to develop a way to adjust the fiber-optic
cameras used during endoscopic surgery (procedures performed remotely,
inside the body). Our EOG device allows a doctor to change the camera's
view with eye movements, while his or her hands are engaged in
manipulating other surgical instruments.

<P><B><A NAME="3">Mind Control</A></B>

<P>Devices that detect EMG or EOG signals have successfully linked
humans to computers for a wide variety of applications, but in each case
the process relies on tiny biological voltages from muscles or eyes. Is
it possible to make a neural connection without those intermediaries?
Indeed, some people have operated computers in a rudimentary fashion
using the underlying electrical activity of the brain itself.

<P>That the human mind produces measurable electrical signals is no
surprise. In 1929 the German psychiatrist <A HREF="http://jenameg10.meg.uni-jena.de/nostalg.html">Hans Berger</A> coined the term
"electroencephalogram," commonly known as <A HREF="http://www.ami-med.com/mhc/scr/003931sc.htm">EEG</A>, to describe recordings of
voltage fluctuations of the brain that can be detected using electrodes
attached to the scalp. These EEG signals arise from the cerebral cortex,
a several-centimeter-thick layer of highly convoluted neuronal tissue.
Neurophysiologists believe that the pyramidal cells of the cerebral
cortex are the source of EEG voltages. Each of these nerve cells
constitutes a tiny current dipole, with a polarity that depends on
whether the net input to the cell is inhibitory or excitatory. Hence,
the layer of densely packed pyramidal cells in the brain produces a
constantly shifting configuration of electrical activity as the nerve
impulses change. Measurements on the scalp can detect the underlying
electrical patterns, albeit in a form that is attenuated and unfocused
by passage through the skull.

<P>For decades, researchers have sought to correlate various EEG signals
with particular behaviors or sensations, and the results of these
studies have slowly outlined a functional map of the human cerebral
cortex. Scientists can now tailor their EEG experiments by placing
electrodes on one part of the scalp, directly over the source of
activity they desire to monitor. In order to use this electrical
activity to operate a computer, some workers have attempted to isolate
specific EEG signals that people can adjust at will. Unfortunately, the
electrical output of the brain is not easily controlled. A common
strategy calls for measuring a variety of EEG signals continuously and
filtering out the unwanted components.

<P>The analysis of continuous EEG signals, or brain waves, is something
of a science in itself, complete with its own set of perplexing
nomenclature. Different waves, like so many radio stations, are
categorized by the frequency of their emanations or, in some cases, by
the shape of their waveforms. Five types are particularly important.

<P>Alpha waves (those in the frequency band between eight and 13 hertz)
can be brought on easily by actions as simple as closing one's eyes;
these waves are usually quite strong, but they diminish in amplitude
when a person is stimulated by light, concentrates on vivid imagery or
attempts other mental efforts. Beta waves (typically from 14 to 30
hertz) are associated with an alert state of mind and can reach
frequencies near 50 hertz during intense mental activity. Theta waves
(four to seven hertz) arise from emotional stress, especially
frustration or disappointment. Delta waves (below 3.5 hertz) occur
during deep sleep. Mu waves (also known as the wicket rhythm because the
rounded EEG traces resemble the wickets used in the lawn game croquet)
appear to be associated with the motor cortex: they diminish with
movement or the intention to move.

<P>Most attempts to control a computer with continuous EEG measurements
work by monitoring alpha or mu waves, because people can learn to change
the amplitude of these two rhythms by making the appropriate mental
effort. A person might accomplish this result, for instance, by
recalling some strongly stimulating image or by raising his or her level
of attention.

<P>Over the past decade Jonathan R. Wolpaw and Dennis J. MacFarland of
the <A HREF="http://www.wadsworth.org/BMS/">New York State Department of Health Wadsworth Center</A> in Albany have
taught patients to control the amplitude of their mu waves by
visualizing various motor activities, such as smiling, chewing or
swallowing. With enough practice, the trainees could learn to manipulate
a computer cursor that was programmed to shift with changes in the
amplitude of the measured mu waves.

<P>We have also experimented with brain waves. In 1987 we first
configured one of our Biomuse devices to act as an EEG monitor and set
it to adjust a music synthesizer. That exercise provided a dramatic
demonstration of the power of this technique. We arranged the system to
detect bursts of alpha-wave activity, which can be brought on at will,
for example, by unfocusing one's attention. Such equipment constitutes a
brain-activated electronic switch, a device that even a person with
severe physical disabilities can trigger.

<P>For example, we have developed similar equipment for a Brazilian
patient immobilized with advanced 
<A HREF="http://www.caregiver.org/text/fs_als.html">amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</A> (also
known as Lou Gehrig's disease). To type words, he employs our alpha-wave
switch and a personal computer using special visual keyboard software.
It is a laborious process because he can make only yes or no responses
and must go through as many as six iterations before he can narrow the
search to a single key. Still, he now has an electronic aid that allows
him to communicate, a vital ability that had previously been completely
lost to him.

<P>Other handicapped people have benefited from a second type of
brain-wave-measuring apparatus, one that monitors what is called the
evoked potential, or EP, action of the brain. The EP signal arises in
response to certain stimuli--such as a loud noise or a flash of light--a
tiny fraction of a second after it is provoked. The method of EP
detection has been used by a number of researchers for controlling
computers with the brain's electrical activity. In particular, 
<A HREF="http://www.ski.org/EESutter_lab/default.html">Erich E.
Sutter</A> of the <A HREF="http://www.ski.org/">Smith-Kettlewell Eye Research Institute</A> in San Francisco
has developed a system that allows physically handicapped people to
select words or phrases from a menu of flashing squares on a computer
monitor. By keeping a gaze fixed on the appropriate square for a second
or two, a person wired with scalp electrodes can convey a choice to the
computer. The machine monitors the form and timing of the EP response
and so can discriminate which of the coded flashes caused the evoked
electrical activity in the brain. The computer can then pick out the one
item chosen from the group of words or phrases presented on the screen.

<P>Like Sutter, <A HREF="http://www.dtic.dla.mil/airforcelink/pa/new/airman/0296/look.htm">Grant McMillan</A> and his colleagues at the Alternative
Control Technology Laboratory of <A HREF="http://www.wpafb.af.mil/">Wright-Patterson Air Force Base</A> in
Dayton, Ohio, are similarly experimenting with EP signals. They hope to
help military pilots by teaching them how to modify the magnitude of EP
signals at will. This mechanism provides a coarse auxiliary control--one
that pilots can operate even when their hands and feet are busy flying
the airplane.

<P><B><A NAME="4">Future Shocks</A></B>

<P>Although it is clear that an immense amount of electrical activity
accompanies the thought processes of the human brain, researchers can
recognize only a few of these underlying patterns from voltage
fluctuations on a person's scalp. There has been little success, for
example, in pinpointing which particular set of brain waves will
consistently arise when a person thinks of something as specific as a
single word or letter of the alphabet. But more advanced systems for
unraveling complex brain waves might yet succeed in accomplishing this
feat.

<P>The prospects for controlling computers through neural signals are
indeed difficult to judge because the field of research is still in its
infancy. Much progress has been made in taking advantage of the power of
personal computers to perform the rapid-fire operations needed to
recognize patterns in biological impulses, and the search continues for
new signals that may be even more useful than those tapped so far. Newly
developed software is also just now being distributed that can use the
existing speed and sophistication of modern computer hardware most
effectively.

<P>If the advances of the next century match the strides of the past few
decades, direct neural communication between humans and computers may
ultimately mature and find widespread use. Perhaps newly purchased
computers will one day arrive with biological signal sensors and
thought-recognition software built in, just as keyboard and mouse are
commonly found on today's units. If so, computer buffs of the 21st
century may be surprised to find that this method of directing their
machines had first been developed in the 1990s through the efforts of a
handful of academic researchers and a determined group of physically
handicapped pioneers.

<BR>Single-celled organisms--<A HREF="http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/bacteria/bacteria.html">bacteria</A>, 
<A HREF="http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/fungi/fungi.html">fungi</A> and <A HREF="http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/alllife/eukaryotasy.html">protozoa</A>--thrive on all
parts of the earth's surface. Their habitats range from the boiling hot
waters of thermal springs to the pleasantly cool soils of backyard
gardens. Microorganisms provide essential services to other creatures by
decomposing waste products and forming nutrients. Some microbes also
inflict harm by infecting higher organisms and causing disease.
Fortunately, scientists have learned to control many of those damaging
effects and to expand on the ways microorganisms benefit humankind.

<P>Although people have used the metabolic activities of microorganisms
for thousands of years to produce cheese, wine and bread, it was not
until the mid-20th century that scientists harnessed microbes to create
antibiotics and other pharmaceuticals. Today people also employ
microorganisms for such diverse tasks as controlling pests, treating
sewage and degrading oil spills. With countless novel uses still
awaiting discovery, biologists continue to scour the surface of the
earth in search of microbes that might prove valuable in formulating new
drugs or improving industrial processes. But until recently, few such
bio-prospectors thought to look deep inside the earth. Long-standing
scientific dogma held that this realm was essentially sterile. But that
belief, as it turns out, was wrong.

<P><B><A NAME="1">It's Alive!</A></B>

<P>The first hints that microorganisms lived in the deep
subsurface--hundreds to thousands of meters below ground--emerged in the
1920s from the studies of Edson S. Bastin, a geologist at the <A HREF="http://geosci.uchicago.edu/">University
of Chicago</A>. Bastin questioned why water extracted from oil fields
contained hydrogen sulfide and bicarbonate. After puzzling for some
time, Bastin ventured an explanation. He knew that so-called
sulfate-reducing bacteria can exploit sulfate for respiration in places
on the surface where no oxygen is present. So Bastin reasoned that such
bacteria must also live in underground oil reservoirs and produce
hydrogen sulfide and bicarbonate when they degrade organic components in
oil. By 1926 Bastin and Frank E. Greer, a colleague at the University of
Chicago who specialized in microbiology, had succeeded in culturing
sulfate-reducing bacteria from groundwater samples extracted from an oil
deposit that was hundreds of meters below the surface. Bastin and Greer
speculated that these microbes might have been descendants of organisms
buried more than 300 million years ago when the sediments that
constituted the oil reservoir were deposited. But they had no way to
test this intriguing hypothesis. At the time, many scientists viewed
with skepticism the very idea of microorganisms living deep underground,
noting that oil-drilling techniques were not designed to obtain samples
uncontaminated by microorganisms from the surface. With little
acceptance or support in the scientific community, the views of Bastin
and Greer languished.


<P>Interest in the microbiology of petroleum deposits temporarily
revived during the late 1940s and 1950s, when Claude E. Zobell of the
<A HREF="http://sio.ucsd.edu/">Scripps Institution of Oceanography</A> and his colleagues investigated
microbial processes in sediments buried far below the seabed. But
research into subsurface microbiology again fell into dormancy during
the 1960s and 1970s. Despite the importance of rock formations as
reservoirs and conduits for water supplies, few considered the
possibility of microbial activity deep underground. Most researchers
believed that water underwent predominantly inorganic chemical
alterations as it passed through the earth and that biological
influences were restricted to near-surface soil layers. These scientists
routinely assumed that any microbes found in groundwater samples taken
from great depths were surface contaminants.

<P>Then, during the late 1970s and early 1980s, concerns about the
quality of groundwater stimulated some investigators at the <A HREF="http://www.usgs.gov/">U.S.
Geological Survey</A> and the <A HREF="http://www.epa.gov/">Environmental Protection Agency</A> to reevaluate
their understanding of <A HREF="http://gwrp.cciw.ca/education/gwfacts/c1.html">groundwater chemistry</A>. This work spurred them to
reconsider the possibility that microorganisms could inhabit
water-yielding rock formations. At the same time, the 
<A HREF="http://www.doe.gov/">U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)</A> faced the daunting task of cleaning up the industrial
facilities where nuclear materials had been produced. (As a cold war
expedient, the DOE had dumped vast quantities of waste--including
organic-rich solutions, metals and radioactive materials--into the
subsurface at these sites.) DOE scientists were also studying how to
build underground repositories that could isolate high-level radioactive
wastes for thousands of years.

<P>During this period, Frank J. Wobber, a geologist and manager at the
DOE, reasoned that if microorganisms were present well below the earth's
surface, they might helpfully degrade buried organic pollutants or
dangerously disrupt the integrity of closed chambers containing
radioactive waste. But a great deal of fundamental research needed to be
done before such practical concerns could be addressed. And so he began
a special effort, called the <A HREF="http://www.er.doe.gov/production/oher/EPR/subprog.html">Subsurface Science Program</A>, within the DOE.
His idea was to sponsor a diverse group of biologists, geologists and
chemists to search systematically for <A HREF="http://www.agu.org/deepbact.html">deep-seated life-forms</A> and examine
their activities.

<P>Because water brought up from deep drill holes is easily contaminated
with organisms living near the surface, the team assembled by Wobber
decided to study pieces of rock instead. But first the group needed a
way to collect clean, intact samples of rock <A HREF="http://www.er.doe.gov/production/oher/EPR/subprog.html#plate3">(cores)</A> from deep in the
crust.

<P>Tommy J. Phelps of <A HREF="http://www.esd.ornl.gov/sections/ebs/mi/">Oak Ridge National Laboratory</A> and W. Timothy
Griffin of <A HREF="http://www.golder.com/">Golder Associates</A> rose to the challenge by designing a
special drilling apparatus that minimized contact of the core samples
with the drilling fluid needed to provide lubrication in a borehole. And
James P. McKinley of Battelle, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory,
along with F. S. (Rick) Colwell of <A HREF="http://www.inel.gov/">Idaho National Engineering
Laboratory</A>, formulated special "tracers"--additives that could be mixed
with the drilling fluid to indicate whether this liquid (and any
microorganisms carried inside it) could have penetrated the core
samples.

<P><B><A NAME="2">Striking It Rich</A></B>

<P>The search for subsurface microbes began in 1987, when the DOE
arranged to drill several deep boreholes in South Carolina near the
<A HREF="http://www.srs.gov/">Savannah River</A> nuclear materials processing facility. With the operators
of the drilling rig there, a field team of scientists labored to avoid
microbial contamination. Researchers diligently added tracers and
monitored procedures around the clock as drilling proceeded. When the
drillers brought a core to the surface, a member of the team quickly
encapsulated the sample and placed it in a <A HREF="http://www.ca.sandia.gov/outreach/html/glove-bag.html">"glove bag"</A> for processing.
Those plastic containers provided a sterile environment filled with an
unreactive gas (nitrogen) as a precaution to protect any so-called
obligatory anaerobes--bacteria that would be quickly poisoned by the
oxygen in the air.

<P>Using surgical rubber gloves attached to the interior of these bags,
members of the team used sterile tools to pare away the outermost rind
of each core sample, leaving only the part that was least likely to have
been exposed to bacterial contaminants in the drilling fluid. If seepage
of the tracer chemical indicated that a particular specimen might have
been tainted, the scientist dissecting it noted that the core from which
it came was very possibly contaminated.

<P>Pristine inner core samples recovered in this way were then placed in
sterile containers filled with nitrogen, which were packed in ice and
shipped to research laboratories across North America. Within 72 hours
after the removal of the rocks from the subsurface, other members of the
research group based at many different institutions were subjecting the
samples to a battery of tests designed to evaluate the rocks and the
microorganisms they harbored. After these initial experiments,
researchers sent the microbes they had extracted from the subsurface
samples to special repositories in Florida and Oregon to be stored in
liquid nitrogen at -96 degrees Celsius.

<P>The first results of this quest for deep-seated life-forms were
extraordinary. The scientists involved quickly learned that diverse
types of microorganisms lived beneath the Savannah River site at depths
extending at least as far as 500 meters beneath the surface, the deepest
core taken. We and our many colleagues working under the aegis of the
DOE's Subsurface Science Program have since examined many other geologic
settings. Although we are still unsure of the extent of fungi or
protozoa, the results clearly indicate that subsurface bacteria are
ubiquitous. We have now recovered these organisms from formations with
temperatures as high as 75 degrees C (167 degrees Fahrenheit) and from
depths extending to 2.8 kilometers (1.7 miles) below the surface.

<P>What determines the maximum depth at which subsurface microbes can
exist? Mounting pressure exerts little direct effect on microorganisms
even several kilometers below ground level. It is the increasing
temperature that limits the depth of subsurface life. The maximum
temperature that such organisms can tolerate remains something of a
mystery, but biological oceanographers have found bacteria that are
capable of growing at 110 degrees C in deep-sea volcanic vents, and some
scientists estimate that subsurface microorganisms might be able to
withstand temperatures as high as 140 degrees C, at least for short
periods.

<P>For oceanic crust, where the temperature rises about 15 degrees C per
kilometer of depth, tolerance of 110 degrees allows microbial life to
extend (on average) about seven kilometers below the seafloor. For
continental crust, where the temperature is often near 20 degrees C at
the surface and typically increases by about 25 degrees per kilometer,
microscopic life should, on average, reach almost four kilometers
downward into the earth.

<P>The abundance of microbes will, however, vary considerably from place
to place, even at the same depth in the earth. For example, we have
discovered that samples obtained from 400 meters below the surface of
the ground can contain as few as 100 to as many as 10 million bacteria
in each gram of rock. <A HREF="http://www.gly.bris.ac.uk/www/teach/projects/geomicro">John R. Parkes and his colleagues</A> at the
<A HREF="http://www.gly.bris.ac.uk/">University of Bristol</A> have found somewhat higher concentrations of
microorganisms living in sediments beneath the ocean floor. In
comparison, agricultural topsoil typically contains more than one
billion bacteria in each gram of dirt.

<P>It seems that the richness of life in the deep subsurface depends not
only on tolerable temperatures but also on the capacity of the local
environment to support growth and proliferation. Crucial prerequisites
include the presence of water and the sheer availability of space in the
pores of the rock. The region hosting the microbes must also contain the
nutrients--such as carbon, nitrogen, phosphorous and various trace
metals--that microorganisms need to synthesize their cellular
constituents, including DNA and proteins. The environment also has to
offer some form of fuel to provide the energy required for this ongoing
activity.

<B><A NAME="3">From Sandstone to SLiMEs</A></B>

<P>The types of microbes found in the earth's deep realms depend on the
particulars of the local subsurface environment. Diverse bacterial
communities thrive in most <A HREF="http://www.science.ubc.ca/%7Egeol202/s/rock_cycle/rcsedim.html">sedimentary rocks</A>, which commonly contain a
rich supply of organic compounds to nourish microorganisms. These
nutrients were originally produced by plants at the earth's surface
before the loose sands, silts or clays that constitute most sedimentary
formations were buried and consolidated into solid rock. As long as
these nutrients remain available, microorganisms living within the pores
of the sediments can continue to survive and grow. Sedimentary rocks
also supply oxidized forms of sulfur, iron and manganese that can
provide the energy these microbes need. The chemical power sources here
are so-called reduction reactions (processes that involve the gain of
electrons).

<P>As sediments become more deeply buried over geologic time, they are
increasingly compacted. Much of the dwindling pore space eventually
becomes cemented with minerals that precipitate from fluids passing
through the rock. Consequently, as depth and pressure increase, the
opportunity for obtaining life-sustaining materials declines, and the
overall rate of metabolism of microbial communities gradually
diminishes, except in those spots that directly surround rich
concentrations of nutrients. The distribution of microorganisms in
sediments ultimately becomes quite patchy. Small colonies--or even
individual cells--live well separated from one another within the rock.
Not surprisingly, then, searching for microorganisms living in these
settings proves to be a hit-or-miss affair. Todd O. Stevens of Battelle,
Pacific Northwest National Laboratory has found, for example, that with
sediment collected near the DOE's <A HREF="http://www.hanford.gov/">Hanford</A> facility in Washington State,
the larger the sample tested, the better the chances of finding
microbial activity.

<P>Although quite inhospitable, such hardened sedimentary rock is not
the most challenging environment for subsurface microbes: some
environments appear far more hostile. The bulk of the continental crust
is composed of <A HREF="http://www.science.ubc.ca/%7Egeol202/s/rock_cycle/rcgenign.html">igneous rock</A> (that is, rock solidified from molten
magma), which contains little organic carbon. Nevertheless, Stevens and
McKinley discovered bacteria living within igneous formations that are
composed of layers of <A HREF="http://www.hf.uio.no/iakn/roger/lithic/basalt.html">basalt</A> (a dark, fine-grained type of rock).

<P>Microorganisms thrive in other igneous rock as well. Karsten Pedersen
of the University of G&#246;teborg in Sweden detected bacteria in water
flowing through deep fractures in granite--a light-colored,
coarse-grained variety of igneous rock. Because igneous rock is too hot
to support life when it is first formed, the microbes found within such
rock must have been carried there by the flow of groundwater sometime
after the parent magma cooled and solidified.

<P>Little buried organic matter is available within igneous formations,
and so Stevens and McKinley were surprised to find that microbes could
flourish in basalt. They eventually discovered the secret. The bacterial
communities living there include so-called autotrophs, organisms that
synthesize organic compounds (proteins, fats and other biological
molecules rich in carbon) from inorganic sources. Many types of
autotrophic bacteria capture energy from inorganic chemical reactions
involving iron or sulfur. The autotrophs living in these basalts use
hydrogen gas for energy and derive carbon from inorganic carbon dioxide.
These <A HREF="http://web.cnrs-orleans.fr/%7Egrivet/poster.html#Intro">"acetogens"</A> then excrete simple organic compounds that other
bacteria can in turn consume. In these basalts the hydrogen gas is
produced by the reaction of oxygen-poor water with iron-bearing
minerals. Many of us call such environments "SLiMEs," for subsurface
lithoautotrophic microbial ecosystems. Amazingly, SLiME microorganisms
can persist indefinitely without any supply of carbon from the surface.

<P><B><A NAME="4">Old as the Hills?</A></B>

<P>Like Bastin and Greer working decades before us, we wondered whether
subsurface bacterial colonies might survive for as long as the rocks
that host them. Such longevity is clearly not always possible. The
continuing burial of sediments can ultimately raise temperatures
sufficiently to purge an entire rock formation of live bacteria. More
local sterilization may also occur where fiery hot magma impinges on
sedimentary strata, leaving a body of igneous rock with some well-baked
sediments surrounding it. Once such newly solidified rock cools, or
tectonic forces lift hot, deeply buried sedimentary layers to a cooler
position closer to the surface, bacteria carried by groundwater will
then colonize the formerly sterile zones.

<P>Yet that process of infiltration can be exceedingly slow. <A HREF="http://terrassa.pnl.gov:2080/EESC_public/technical_groups/murphy.html">Ellyn M.
Murphy</A> of Battelle, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory has
determined, for example, that the groundwater now present deep beneath
the Savannah River facility has not been in contact with the surface for
thousands of years. In the deepest sites we have examined, our
measurements and computer modeling indicate that the groundwater has
been isolated from the surface for millions of years. Because
microorganisms could not have traveled downward from the surface faster
than the groundwater descended, some subsurface microbial communities
must be at least several million years old.

<P>How do microorganisms manage to persevere for so long? In some cases
(for example, SLiMEs), bacteria can survive because the essential
nutrients are constantly renewed; although in most other sorts of
formations, food and energy sources are relatively scarce. Nevertheless,
the resident bacteria appear to have adapted to these rather spartan
living conditions. Bacteria must rely on internal reserves during
periods of long-term starvation (as do higher organisms), and most types
of bacteria shrink from a healthy size of a few microns to less than a
thousandth of their normal volume as they use up their stores. Thomas L.
Kieft of the <A HREF="http://www.nmt.edu/">New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology</A> has found
that such tiny, starved microbes (called dwarf bacteria or
"ultramicro-bacteria") commonly inhabit the subsurface.

<P>The metabolic rate of such starved bacteria is probably much lower
than when they are well fed. As a result, the average frequency of cell
division for a subsurface microbe may be once a century, or even less,
whereas surface microorganisms reproduce in a matter of minutes, hours,
days or, at most, months. Microorganisms living in the deep subsurface
limit their metabolism in order to endure starvation for geologically
significant lengths of time. These bacteria can remain viable at little
or no metabolic cost.

<P>The sluggish pace of microbial metabolism in the subsurface makes it
difficult to define just how many of the bacteria found entombed in
these rocks are truly alive. One approach is to count only those
microbes that can be grown in the laboratory. More than 10 percent of
the cells extracted from sandy sediments where water and nutrients can
generally flow freely will proliferate when given a supply of nutrients
in the laboratory. In contrast, less than one tenth of 1 percent of the
cells drawn from sediments in the arid western U.S. (where the flux of
water is minimal) will grow in a culture dish.

<P>It may be that failure to culture most subsurface bacteria is a
result of our inability to properly reproduce necessary conditions in
the laboratory. Or perhaps these organisms are simply no longer alive.
In rocks where the flux of nutrients and water is low, dead cells
decompose exceedingly slowly, and so some of our biochemical assays
would count them along with the few living cells. Alternatively, most of
the organisms could be functioning but may have lost the ability to
replicate.

<P><B><A NAME="5">The Prospects Underground</A></B>

<P>So far our colleague David L. Bulkwill of <A HREF="http://www.fsu.edu/">Florida State University</A>
has catalogued and preserved more than 9,000 strains of microorganisms
from diverse subsurface environments. These isolates--containing a vast
assortment of bacteria and about 100 types of fungi--are a source of
novel microbial life that have not yet been fully tested for
commercially applicable properties.

<P>Of the small percentage of the collection that researchers have
examined in detail, a surprisingly high proportion show potentially
valuable capabilities. Examples of such traits include the ability to
degrade toxic organic compounds as well as to produce antibiotics,
heat-stable enzymes and even novel pigments. <A HREF="http://www.pfizer.com/nonfin/mainmenunf.html">Pfizer</A> is now screening
3,200 kinds of subsurface bacteria for the production of new
antimicrobial products, and <A HREF="http://www.bio.com/companies/ZymoGenetics.html">ZymoGenetics</A>, a biotechnology company, is
currently examining at least 800 isolates from this archive for
production of other useful substances.

<P>Perhaps many commercial products will result from these
investigations. But even without such quick practical returns, the
effort to probe the earth's interior for microorganisms will surely
reward scientists with a fuller understanding of how life can exist in
isolation from the surface. More study of subsurface communities may,
for instance, indicate how life functioned on the early earth, before
photosynthesis evolved. It may also provide insight into whether
microbes might be living even now under the surface of <A HREF="http://www.sciam.com/explorations/081996explorations.html">Mars</A> or below the
icy exterior of some of the larger moons of the outer solar system.
Seeing how microbes survive the rigors of deep burial on the earth, we
are more inclined to believe tiny extraterrestrials might indeed be
lurking out there.

<B>THE NUCLEAR LEGACY</B>
<P>As Yuri M. Shcherbak chronicles in the first part of your
series "Confronting the Nuclear Legacy," the accident at
Chornobyl was certainly a regional disaster ["Ten Years of the
Chornobyl Era," April]. My observation, both as a recent
resident of that region and as a nuclear engineer, is that
Ukraine has suffered much greater disasters. The collapse of the
economy after decades of mismanagement, the lost heritage during
the communist regime and the tens of millions of victims of
Stalin's purges nearly destroyed the region. And, as Shcherbak
notes, the number of people affected by the nuclear fallout is
much smaller than the doomsayers have reported. The current
troubles of Ukraine are largely unrelated to nuclear technology,
but in today's climate, nuclear technology is popular to blame.
<P><I>Kevan Crawford 
<BR>Salt Lake City, Utah</I>
<P><HR>I appreciated the article "Can Nuclear Waste Be Stored Safely
at Yucca Mountain?" by Chris G. Whipple, in the June issue. But
given that the "age of scientific inquiry" began only about 400
years ago, why do our government advisers select 10,000 or more
years as the period for which we must design storage now? Even as
short as a 400-year storage goal would seem a reasonable design
plan, possibly cheaper and, dare I say, more pragmatic?
<P><I>John Sorflaten 
<BR>Fairfield, Iowa</I>
<P><HR>We were dismayed to read in the May issue, as part of your
nuclear legacy series, the article "Hanford's Nuclear Wasteland,"
by Glenn Zorpette. It focused only on the problems of the distant
past and all but ignored the overwhelming progress we are making
at Hanford. In 1995 alone we saved $300 million through our
aggressive reengineering effort and are contributing toward a
$20-billion life-cycle cost savings in Hanford's cleanup. During
the past two years, we have, among other accomplishments,
resolved urgent safety issues associated with the storage of
highly radioactive waste, improved protection of the Columbia
River by accelerating the removal of spent nuclear fuel from
aging storage basins-at a savings of $350 million-and achieved 97
percent of cleanup schedule on time while downsizing by 32
percent. Perhaps your next story will incorporate the Hanford of
today rather than focus on its past. 
<P><I>W. C. Moffitt
<BR>Executive Vice President, Westinghouse Hanford Company
<P>R. E. Tiller 
<BR>President and General Manager, ICF Kaiser Hanford
<P><HR><B>Zorpette responds:</B></I> 
<P>The morass at Hanford is
impossible to understand without at least some historical
context, which, in any case, was limited to about one quarter of
the article. As I noted in the piece, the Department of Energy
itself says that cleanup projects started between 1989 and 1994
were 30 to 50 percent more expensive than their equivalents in
the private sector. So the alleged savings of $300 million in a
1995 budget of $1.576 billion means nothing more than gross
inefficiencies were reined in somewhat. And the figure of $350
million in presumed savings would be a possible result of taking
care of the spent-fuel problem in the relatively near future
rather than letting it languish unconscionably for a decade or
more. Only at Hanford, perhaps, would such a plan be considered a
fine example of thrift (or anything other than common sense).
<P><HR>
<B>RELATIVELY CONFUSING</B>
<P>It is highly unlikely that Einstein ever wrote the equation
"<I>EL</I> = mc<SUP>2</SUP>" and then crossed out the "<I>L</I>"
("Relatively Expensive," by Charles Seife, News and Analysis,
May). Instead a plausible scenario is that he first wrote
"<I>L </I>= mc<SUP>2</SUP>," with the "<I>L</I>" denoting "<I>Leistung</I>,"
which means "a piece of work." He then changed his mind,
substituting the "<I>L</I>" with an "<I>E</I>". 
<P><I>Joseph Sucher <BR>University of Maryland</I>
<P><HR>In quickly browsing the May issue, my eyes landed on a rather
familiar equation. After reading the brief item about the sale of
Einstein's manuscript, I was somewhat taken aback. Do they not
know what the "<I>L</I>" stands for? Although Einstein derived
the Lorentz term independently of Hendrik Antoon Lorentz, he did
honor the Dutch physicist by using the initial "<I>L</I>."
<P><I>Harold E. Blake <BR>Tupper Lake, N.Y.</I>
<P><HR>I was intrigued by Seife's remark that the "<I>L</I>" in
Einstein's manuscript should be a "superfluous constant." I
suspect that it stood for the Lagrange operator, which Einstein
presumably used in his calculations. For the famous end result,
he then replaced the abstract operator with the physical quantity
"<I>E</I>," for energy. If my hunch is off the mark, it would be
really interesting to know what the "<I>L</I>" stands for.

<B>CLARIFICATION</B>
<P>The Society of the Plastics Industry reports that it is
unaware of any scientific or technical documentation supporting
the claim made by Devra Lee Davis and H. Leon Bradlow ["Can
Environmental Estrogens Cause Breast Cancer?" October 1995] that
men in the plastics industry developed breasts after inhaling
Bisphenol-A. According to Davis, the statement was based on
reports from meetings in the 1970s in which the need to reduce
such exposures was discussed with the Environmental Protection
Agency. At this time, however, no published confirmation of
these reports can be found that suggests a connection between the
compound Bisphenol-A and growth of breasts in male workers.

<P>"Eyes that see the warmth of a man's body in the dark, that
locate ships at night, and find the chimneys of factories by
their heat radiation were recently demonstrated as potentially
valuable to industry. These devices use reflectors to focus the
'black light' radiation of a target onto tiny elements called
thermistors, substances which have such unusual electrical
sensitivity to heat that they can detect temperature variations
as small as one-millionth of a degree. Thermistors stem from a
group of materials known as semi-conductors, which are
interesting because their electrical reaction to temperature is
the reverse of that in normal conductors. As their temperature
increases, their resistance drops rapidly."

six and seven feet in diameter. Four to eight of these kites were
required to support the camera, depending upon the strength of
the wind. Distinct views were obtained of the Common and Beacon
Street, and Mr. Eddy estimates that in one of the views the
camera was, at the moment of exposure, 1,500 feet above the

"The extraordinary vessel shown in our engraving was launched

iron platform, 120 feet long, mounted on six hollow lenticular
rollers, each some 39 feet in diameter. Only about one-third of

screw propeller, each pair of wheels being slowly revolved by a
50 horse power engine. It is hoped that by the use of the rollers
the friction of the water will be reduced to the minimum, it
being the theory of the inventor that the boat should roll over
the water without cutting through it. Experiments made with a
small model, the rollers of which were moved by clockwork, showed
that the speed of the boat was doubled by an extra expenditure of
power of only one-quarter. The whole plan is so original that the

<CENTER><H2>FREEZE-DRYING</H2>
by Herbert Aschkenasy</CENTER>
<P>Freeze-drying is possible because under the right conditions,
a solid material such as ice can change directly into a gas
without first passing through a liquid phase. This process,
called sublimation, gradually removes all ice from food and other
biological matter or even from inorganic substances such as
ceramics.
<P>As a method of preserving many organic materials,
freeze-drying is ideal. The freezing immobilizes the object,
allowing it to retain its original shape. The absence of water
discourages the growth of microorganisms and prevents other
chemical changes associated with spoilage. Also, because water
sublimates so readily, the conditions needed to freeze-dry a food
will not eliminate most other constituents, such as the
acetaldehyde molecules that give citrus fruits some of their
flavor.
<P>The rudiments of freeze-drying were known to the Peruvian
Incas of the Andes, who stored their potatoes and other
foodstuffs on the heights above Machu Picchu. There the cold
temperatures froze the tubers, and the water inside slowly
vaporized under the low air pressure. Wide use of the process
commercially only began during World War II, to preserve blood
plasma needed at the front lines.
<P>Since the 1960s, it has been applied to upward of 400 foods,
from meat to fruits and vegetables. A few foods, such as lettuce
and watermelon, are not good candidates for freeze-drying;
consisting almost entirely of water, they disintegrate when
frozen and dried. The process does preserve desirable
microorganisms such as cheese cultures. It can even be used as a
form of taxidermy and for the preservation of flowers.
<P>Freeze-drying is more costly than simply chilling food to
preserve it. But freeze-dried food in an airtight container may
last for decades without spoilage; it only needs to be exposed to
water to reconstitute it. We once rehydrated a 23-year-old beef
stew military ration for a group of military officers, all of
whom found the meat to be palatable.

Albany, Ore.</I>

IN FOCUS
<P><CENTER><H2>HIV'S ACHILLES' HEEL</H2>
Drugs and education <BR>are 
starting to slow <BR>the AIDS virus</CENTER>
<P>The deadly spread of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
offers the world a challenge to rival the rampages of any
cinematic aliens. Twenty-two million people live with HIV today,
and five new victims are infected every minute. At the <A HREF="http://www.interchg.ubc.ca/aids11/AIDS96.html">Eleventh
International Conference on AIDS</A> in Vancouver in July,
researchers, politicians and patient-activists traded
progress reports.
<P>Top billing went to new <A HREF="http://www.aidsnyc.org/network/simple/combo.html">drug combinations</A> that have beaten the
virus down to virtually undetectable amounts in most patients for
a year-in one patient, for two years. The amount of virus in a
patient's plasma, as detected by viral RNA, indicates how many of
the patient's cells are infected and thus the intensity of "the
fire that burns up the immune system," in the words of David D.
Ho of the <A HREF="http://digitalweb.com/adarc/adarc.htm">Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center</A> in New York City.
<P>The problem that has dogged anti-HIV drugs is resistant mutant
forms that spread throughout patients within mere weeks. The
mutants gain the upper hand because of the extremely high
turnover of viruses. The latest numbers indicate that even in the
early stages of HIV infection, a patient produces 10 billion
particles a day, including millions of mutants. No single drug
can defeat all of them. Combinations of drugs, however, can slow
replication of the virus enough to delay resistance.
<P>One key study is being conducted by Roy M. Gulick of New York
University Medical Center and his colleagues. It employs a
combination of three drugs: AZT, <A HREF="http://www.kff.org/natip/3tc.html">3TC</A> and <A HREF="http://www.aidsnyc.org/network/simple/indi.html">indinavir</A>. AZT and 3TC
inhibit HIV's reverse transcriptase, the enzyme HIV uses when it
first infects a cell. Indinavir's target is the HIV protease,
which the virus needs later to assemble new particles. For almost
a year the combination suppressed HIV enough to slow-though not
prevent-the accumulation of mutations conferring resistance to
the drugs.
<P>Another triple combination that has shown long-lasting
antiviral activity consists of three reverse transcriptase
inhibitors: nevirapene, AZT and <A HREF="http://www.aidsnyc.org/network/access/drugs/dida.html">ddI</A>. And even more promising
drugs are in development. Researchers now believe physicians
should not treat patients with any single antiviral medicine,
because it encourages the evolution of resistant mutants. "If you
leave the door half open, the virus will push it open the rest of
the way," says Emilio A. Emini of <A HREF="http://www.merck.com/">Merck</A>.
<P>Combination therapy has raised the tantalizing hope that HIV
can be eliminated from patients. Ho calculates that if viral
replication could be suppressed for one to three years, all
significant pools of HIV in the body should become exhausted and
the infection perhaps conquered. He and others are testing the
idea by treating a group of patients with a protease inhibitor
called <A HREF="http://www.aidsnyc.org/network/simple/riton.html">ritonavir</A>, together with AZT and 3TC.
<P>The study focuses on newly infected patients, because they
have had less time to accumulate mutations-and have healthier
immune systems-than people with longer-established disease. If
the patients have no signs of virus in their lymph nodes after a
year, the therapy will be stopped. Even if the virus returns,
studies suggest it may persist at a lower level than it would
have without the early therapy.
<P>Most researchers are wary of talk about eradicating HIV. They
point out that even a small amount of virus lurking beyond the
reach of drugs-perhaps in the central nervous system-could reseed
an infection. No one can be sure for how long triple or
quadruple drug therapies can suppress HIV. Moreover, some
patients may be unable to tolerate the side effects.
<P>Another compelling practical problem is the cost of such
drugs. A triple therapy regimen costs more than $10,000 a year.
("Greed equals death" was the favorite slogan of demonstrators at
Vancouver.) Yet 94 percent of HIV infections occur in the
developing world, where such sums are completely beyond the reach
of patients or governments. Although drug companies have given
away other medicines-Janssen Pharmaceutica has donated
antifungal medicines for AIDS patients in Africa, and Merck has
given away a treatment for river blindness-antiviral agents are
far more expensive.
<P>Noting that all antiviral drugs have limitations, Robert C.
Gallo of the Institute of Human Virology in Baltimore, who first
showed that HIV causes AIDS, urged researchers to pursue
therapies based on how the body controls viruses. Such biological
treatments might be less toxic than antiviral drugs, Gallo
believes. He has identified some candidates: a class of chemicals
known as beta chemokines that occur naturally in the body and
inhibit HIV infection in the test tube. "I believe this has
opened up new possibilities for control," Gallo states. He plans
to investigate whether the compounds can prevent an HIV-related
virus from infecting monkeys.
<P>For a decade, Jay A. Levy of the University of California at
San Francisco has been studying another biological factor, one
secreted by <A HREF="http://sdchemw1.ucsd.edu/%7Ejmc/ve/cells.html">killer</A><I> T</I> cells. Levy maintains that the factor
suppresses HIV and is present in unusually large amounts in
patients whose disease progresses slowly, but so far he has been
unable to isolate and characterize it.
<P>Other, well-studied immune system molecules are also
demonstrating activity against HIV. Anthony S. Fauci, director of
the <A HREF="http://www.niaid.nih.gov/">National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</A>, says
injections of the immune system protein interleukin-10
strikingly decrease plasma levels of HIV for a few hours.
Interleukin-2 is already showing promise as a therapy.
<P>Perhaps the biggest prize would be a vaccine that could
prevent the spread of HIV infection. William E. Paul, head of the
office of AIDS research at the National Institutes of Health,
complains that current and past efforts to design vaccines do not
adequately exploit all the recent advances in biotechnology or
the approaches suggested by our greater understanding of the
immune system. Pharmaceutical companies are shying away from the
area, fearful of being held liable if a vaccine is ineffective or
causes harm.
<P>Yet a vaccine against HIV need not be high-tech. John Moore of
the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center says an HIV vaccine that
would probably be effective to some degree could be made now,
simply by inactivating live HIV. Although the strategy is risky,
some developing countries might see that as a risk worth taking,
Moore says.
<P>There was some good news for developing countries at
Vancouver. According to some published studies, treatment with
AZT alone has reduced the rate of transmission of HIV from
mothers to their children by about 65 percent. Yvonne J. Bryson
of the University of California at Los Angeles thinks more potent
drugs could reduce the transmission rate to 2 percent. For
example, nevirapene, which exerts its antiviral effect
immediately, could become a short-term treatment for pregnant,
HIV-positive women who do not seek medical care until they are
ready to deliver. The rate of infection among pregnant women has
fallen in Uganda in the past few years, presumably a result of
educational campaigns. Similar encouraging signs have been noted
in other African countries with high infection rates. One hope is
that vaginal anti-HIV washes or ointments might be developed.
<P>One third of HIV patients worldwide actually die of
<A HREF="http://www.cpmc.columbia.edu/tbcpp/">tuberculosis</A> (TB), which takes advantage of weakened immune
systems. Because TB spreads easily, HIV is indirectly spurring an
epidemic of the disease in HIV-negative people. Yet TB in
HIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals alike can be cured
easily with drugs costing just $11, says Peter Piot of the <A HREF="http://gpawww.who.ch/">Joint
United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS</A>.
<P>Erik De Clercq of the <A HREF="http://cc5.kuleuven.ac.be/rega/">Rega Institute</A> in Belgium, who studies
compounds showing anti-HIV potential, summarizes AIDS progress by
paraphrasing Winston Churchill. We have not reached the end of
the struggle against HIV, he notes, or even the beginning of the
end. But we have, perhaps, reached the end of the beginning.

When the <I>Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE)</I> satellite
produced its first <A HREF="http://arcturus.mit.edu/gallery/cobe.html">detailed measurements</A> of the cosmic microwave
background-the so-called echo of creation-cosmologists cheered.
It was a proud moment in the age-old effort to understand our
origins, taken as confirmation of the prevailing model of the big
bang. Four years later, however, the pages of the
<I>Astrophysical Journal</I> look much as they did before, full
of contentious debate over the age of the universe, the nature of
"dark matter" and the ways that mysterious physical laws may have
shaped the world around us. What happened?
<P>For one, astronomers such as Wendy L. Freedman of the Carnegie
Observatories in Pasadena, Calif., have continued to refine their
measurements of the Hubble constant, the rate of cosmic
expansion. The latest numbers indicate a universe roughly nine to
12 billion years old, just barely old enough to accommodate the
most ancient stars. A number of recent observations, however,
including work carried out by James S. Dunlop of the University
of Edinburgh and his colleagues, reveal oddly mature-looking
galaxies in the very early universe. This seeming
inconsistency-objects that appear older than the inferred age of
the universe-is commonly known as the age problem.
<P>Things get worse for inflationary cosmology, a popular
elaboration on the big bang that explains several puzzling
aspects of the universe. The <I>COBE</I> results are merely
consistent with-not proof of-inflation, and inflation has an
unfortunate corollary: it requires that the universe be denser
than it appears. In the simplest interpretation, more matter
means a younger universe, exacerbating the age problem. (Much of
this extra material must consist of unseen dark matter of
indeterminate nature, yet another uncomfortable unknown.)
<P>Not everyone takes the seeming conflict very seriously. "It is
not time to jump off the roof!" laughs Michael Turner of Fermilab
in Batavia, Ill. He is reassured both by the latest estimates of
the Hubble constant, which make the universe slightly older than
before, and by some slight downward revisions in the estimated
ages of the oldest stars. Turner, like a number of his
colleagues, also thinks the various elements of the big bang
model can be more readily reconciled by assuming a "cosmological
constant," a kind of energy woven in the fabric of space. The
cosmological constant, often known by the Greek symbol lambda,
hides some of the cosmic mass as an intrinsic form of energy.
<P>Yet the cosmological constant itself is the source of much
puzzlement. Indeed, Christopher T. Hill of Fermilab calls it "the
biggest problem in all of physics." Current big bang models
propose that lambda is small or zero, and various observations
support that assumption. Hill points out, however, that current
particle physics theory predicts a cosmological constant much,
much greater-by a factor of at least 1052, large enough to have
crunched the universe back down to nothing immediately after the
big bang. "Something is happening to suppress this vacuum
density," says Alan Guth of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, one of the co-developers of inflationary theory.
Nobody knows, however, what that something is.
<P>Paul Steinhardt of the University of Pennsylvania, who helped
to refine the concept of inflation, anticipates that improved
measurement of the cosmic microwave background will soon reveal
whether lambda has a role in shaping the universe. "In the next
five years we will know," he predicts. Guth hopes some unknown
symmetry principle will show that lambda must equal zero. On the
other hand, he admits, a small but nonzero lambda, though
unaesthetic, "would fit things perfectly from an astrophysical
point of view."
<P>Such obliging flexibility engenders a disturbing sense that
cosmological theory resembles an endlessly nested set of
Matryoshka dolls. Each refinement of the big bang delves deeper
into abstruse theory, which grows progressively harder to prove
or disprove. So far inflation is mostly notable for explaining
existing questions about the big bang, such as why the cosmic
microwave background looks the same in all directions. It did
predict <I>COBE</I>'s discovery that the background displays a
noisy pattern-but such patterns are common in nature. And
inflationary cosmology derives from the same kind of particle
physics that yields a huge cosmological constant.
<P>"Our prayer is that whatever makes lambda equal to zero
somehow commutes with the other kinds of physics that we can
think about," Hill reflects. This mixed message lies at the heart
of the ongoing cosmological controversies: the excitement about
exposing ever more intricate details of reality mingles with the
fear that we will never get to see the tiniest and most essential
doll at the center.

Confusion tore through the crew of the space shuttle
<I>Columbia </I>this past February when a tethered satellite
broke free and drifted into oblivion. But for Robert J. Charlson,
an atmospheric scientist at the University of Washington, the
aborted mission was a boon. An unexpected phone call from the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration told him that the
astronauts now had time to snap a few earthy photographs
especially for him.
<P>The photos, intended to help Charlson and others decipher how
atmospheric pollution affects the planet's climate, build on
those brought back from earlier shuttle missions and finally
confirm the geographic extent of the thick haze that covers many
industrial regions. Although scientists have yet to determine the
exact chemical composition of the haze, they do know that a large
part of it is made up of sulfates. Long thought of as a
greenhouse gas and contributor to global warming, sulfate haze is
now also known to cool climate-perhaps even completely
counteracting regional warming caused by such greenhouse gases as
carbon dioxide and methane.
<P>Sulfates lower temperature in two ways. Under clear skies,
sulfur dioxide-a gas commonly emitted by industrial
processes-forms sulfate aerosol, which reflects away incoming
solar radiation. Sulfates can also boost the number of cloud
droplets, thereby increasing cloud albedo, or reflectivity. These
reactions take place in the troposphere, that part of the
atmosphere that extends from the earth's surface up to about 10
kilometers. The temperature-lowering effect of sulfate aerosols,
however, is only regional. Unlike carbon dioxide, which spreads
throughout the atmosphere, sulfur dioxide stays put, and so only
those areas that it engulfs are cooled.
<P>So far estimates for the extent of this cooling effect have
come largely from theoretical calculations and computer modeling
and have varied substantially. Scientists now hope to gather
chemical data on the exact composition of the haze to quantify
the cooling more precisely. Photographs such as these, Charlson
says, are needed to determine how those chemical data, gathered
at a single point, apply to an entire region.
<P>An example is the photograph on page 26 of the Yangtze River
Valley from 400 kilometers away. Taken from the <I>Columbia,
</I>it is the first time that the atmosphere above this area has
ever been imaged. The valley empties into one of China's most
rapidly industrializing areas, the Red Basin in Sichuan Province.
Decades of radiometric measurements had shown that the amount of
sunlight hitting the area had steadily decreased as the
population increased. The captured scene implicates increasing
levels of sulfate-laden smog, most likely from coal burning, as
the reason.
<P>The camera also spied other kinds of aerosol clouds, such as
one that hovered over California's Central Valley. It consisted
of dust and smoke particles generated from burning organic
compounds such as wood and agricultural waste. Such particles
reflect sunlight and increase cloud albedo, although to a lesser
degree than sulfates do.
<P>Although haze offsets some of the greenhouse warming that
seems to be taking place, it has two other effects, both quite
nasty: it creates acid rain and depletes the ozone layer. Spewing
sulfates into the air isn't necessarily a cool thing to
do.

The sleep isn't quite out of my eyes when I am greeted by six
beefy guards with guns on their thighs and boots on their feet.
They hand me forms to fill out, scrutinize my credentials, affix
a radiation dosimeter to the lapel of my jacket and search me
with a metal detector. Another media day has dawned at the <A HREF="http://www.pantex.com/ds/pxgen001.htm">Pantex
plant</A>.
<P>For 42 years, Pantex, which is overseen by the U.S. Department
of Energy, was about as off-limits to journalists as it was to
Soviet spies. Here on the hot, flat Texas Panhandle, tens of
thousands of nuclear weapons were assembled during the cold war.
On this sunny day in July, 14 members of the press, some in
shorts and sandals, will traipse through the innermost recesses
of what remains one of the most heavily guarded sites on the
earth. Pantex is among the few places where the sight of people
carrying assault weapons is reassuring.
<P>Some 3,600 people work at Pantex, most of them for the site's
main contractor, the Mason &AMP; Hanger-Silas Mason Company, which
has run the site for the past 40 years. The U.S. government
stopped making new nuclear weapons several years ago, and in
1996, roughly 85 percent of Pantex's $250-million annual
operating budget will be spent on disassembly of weapons and also
on evaluation of weapons from an "enduring" stockpile, the size
of which is classified.
<P>We begin our tour with a visit to Zone 4, where 8,500
plutonium "pits" are stored in metal barrels housed in an array
of concrete bunkers. Surrounding the bunkers are three fences
topped with razor ribbon or barbed wire; two of these fences are
separated by a dusty no-man's-land of seismic, motion and
infrared sensors. Many of the pits-hollow spheres of plutonium
about the size of a bowling ball-will someday be disposed of, but
some are held in "war reserve," in case the unthinkable happens
after all.
<P>Moving along to Zone 12, we are ushered through labyrinthine
tunnels and past massive, conventional-explosion-proof doors into
a "gravel gertie." Inside these cells, each buried underneath six
meters of graded gravel, the plutonium pit and its outer shell of
conventional high explosive are separated. An accidental
detonation of the explosive could not realistically trigger a
nuclear blast, but it could scatter the deadly plutonium. The
purpose of the gravel at the top of the gerties is to lift in an
explosion, dissipating the energy of the blast, and to adsorb
plutonium and other contaminants.
<P>The cells, built in the 1950s, were named after "Gravel
Gertie," a character in the Dick Tracy comic strip. They are
perfectly round rooms, 10.36 meters in diameter and 6.5 meters
from floor to ceiling. The mechanical hiss of a powerful
ventilation system adds to the ambiance. A red telephone on the
wall lets technicians report their progress to a control center
as they disassemble or move a weapon.
<P>Technicians are now dismantling B-61 bombs, variants of which
have yields between 100 and 500 kilotons, according to the
authoritative <I>Nuclear Weapons Databook. </I>(A Pantex
spokesperson will say only that the yield is "between one kiloton
and 999 kilotons.") In comparison, Little Boy, which destroyed
Hiroshima at the end of World War II, had a yield of 13 kilotons.
Each B-61 has about 6,000 parts.
<P>The tour ends with a question-and-answer session, during which
someone asks the inevitable: When can all nuclear weapons in the
world be eliminated? An executive of Mason &AMP; Hanger does his
best with a question that has challenged some of the brightest
minds of this century. The short version of his answer is: no
time soon.

DISEASE
<P><CENTER><H2>MYSTERIOUS MALADIES</H2>
Separating real from imagined disorders 
<BR>presents
frustrating challenges</CENTER>
<P>As a physician in Tanzania in 1988, Robert Aronowitz struggled
to isolate the cause of the arthritislike joint aches and pains
he saw in dozens of his patients. Local doctors had also been
stumped by the condition-they named it <I>hapa-hapa, </I>or "here
and there," because the symptoms were so difficult to pin down.
Aronowitz, now a clinician and medical historian at the Robert
Wood Johnson Medical School in New Jersey, never could determine
what was behind his patients' complaints.
<P>Such confusion is not unusual: most of us have on occasion
left the doctor's office wondering if something important has
been missed. Explaining sickness can become especially
complicated when the medical community disagrees over whether a
particular disease even exists. Consider the condition known as
<A HREF="http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/publications/cfs/cfshome.htm">chronic fatigue syndrome</A> (CFS), characterized by fatigue, pain
and cognitive disorders, which has been riding a roller coaster
of medical opinion since it was first described in the mid-1980s.
A recent book-<I>Osler's Web: Inside the Labyrinth of the Chronic
Fatigue Syndrome Epidemic</I>-recounts the history of this
controversial ailment.
<P>The author, Hillary Johnson, a journalist and CFS patient,
traces the syndrome from its early connection with the
Epstein-Barr virus to the current search for a novel retrovirus
that some claim may cause CFS. Along the way, she criticizes
health officials for dismissing the syndrome as psychological and
notes that CFS is not the first condition to be overlooked-in the
early part of this century, for instance, multiple sclerosis was
known as "the faker's disease."
<P>People complaining of CFS and similarly disputed maladies,
such as Gulf War syndrome, multiple chemical sensitivity and the
complications supposedly connected to silicone breast implants,
generally blame stress on the immune system for their problems.
According to advocates of these syndromes, an overload of
toxins-nerve gas, insecticides, silicone gel or a virus-somehow
overwork the body's natural defenses, leaving its immune system
in disarray.
<P>Charles Rosenberg, a historian and sociologist of science at
the University of Pennsylvania, notes that immune disorders have
traditionally been difficult to identify. "Even well-established
diseases such as lupus are elusive and complicated to diagnose,"
he says. (On average, patients with lupus, a disease in which the
immune system attacks healthy tissue and damages the skin,
joints, blood and kidneys, go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed for
about four years.) Aronowitz suggests that because of science's
incomplete understanding of the immune system, physicians and
patients-no doubt influenced by the specter of AIDS-often
implicate immune disorders in mysterious illnesses. "They point
to things like environmental exposure and the battle of the
immune system" to explain why some people get sick and others do
not, Aronowitz says.
<P>Of course, not every ache and pain heralds a bona fide
disease. So how do doctors distinguish between hypochondria and
hidden illness? An organic agent, such as a bacterium, virus or
mutated gene, certainly establishes a disease as real. But many
diseases-multiple sclerosis, for example-lack a well-understood
biochemical cause yet are still considered legitimate. What makes
these disorders easier to accept? Edward Shorter, a medical
historian at the University of Toronto, observes that although
doctors may not always understand the cause of a disease, they
are good at finding organic changes triggered by the ailment,
such as the damage to nerve fibers seen in multiple sclerosis.
<P>Shorter goes on to argue that "these mystery diseases share
many of the same symptoms-chronic pain, chronic fatigue, slight
cognitive changes, maybe some dizziness," adding that  "these
symptoms are as common as grass." He notes that some patients
simply need the "gift of time" from family doctors who will
listen to these recurring complaints.
<P>Regardless of how the debates on CFS and other disputed
syndromes are resolved, physicians will no doubt continue to face
mysterious ailments as medical research and the health care
system both attempt to keep up. When pressed further to explain
the "here and there" problems of his Tanzanian patients,
Aronowitz turns philosophical, suggesting that an undercurrent of
as yet unexplained suffering may be at work in many ailments-a
frustrating diagnosis, to be sure.

ANTI GRAVITY
<P><CENTER><H2>PUT A SOCK ON IT</H2></CENTER>
<P>Consider the turkey. Most of us only do that briefly on the
fourth Thursday of each November, after which the bird once again
recedes from our consciousness. Ben Franklin was one of the last
scientists to give the turkey a second thought, and that was only
to nominate it as official symbol for the newly hatched United
States. It didn't win. "We know a whole lot about what eats
turkeys and what turkeys eat," says Richard Buchholz, an
ornithologist at Northeast Louisiana University-but not all that
much about turkeys. Thanks to a recent study published by
Buchholz in the journal <I>The Auk, </I>however, the turkey is
less of a black box bird than it used to be.
<P>Male wild turkeys have brightly colored, unfeathered heads
that ornithologists generally believed played a role in
attracting females. When his own hairline started to recede,
Buchholz began to wonder whether a turkey's bald pate might serve
important functions besides picking up chicks. Other studies
suggested that unfeathered regions might help some birds regulate
body temperature. Wood storks and turkey vultures, for example,
seem to get a radiator effect from their bare legs. They also
appear to achieve a greater heat loss by defecating on their own
legs, thereby promoting evaporation.
<P>Barring years of yoga, wild turkeys will probably never learn
the trick of defecating on their unfeathered regions. But
Buchholz decided to see if those unfeathered heads did indeed
have a role in thermoregulation. To conduct his trials properly,
however, he would need to compare normal, bald turkeys with
turkeys that somehow had lush layers of locks. Because such
animals do not exist naturally, and Monoxidil is not for the
birds, Buchholz needed fake feathers.
<P>His idea was to insulate a turkey's head to the same extent
that real feathers would. To find the right feather substitute,
he needed birds related to turkeys but with feathers on their
heads. Roosters fit the bill. Buchholz got some rooster heads,
froze them and measured the rate at which they warmed up. Then he
plucked them and repeated the process. Then he went to Wal-Mart
and bought socks. ("Hey, all good field biologists and lab
biologists rely on Wal-Mart," Buchholz asserts.) Tests on the
rooster heads revealed that their feathers' insulatory properties
could be simulated by a pair of Adler Casual Acrylic Crew socks,
75 percent hi-bulk acrylic, 25 percent stretch nylon. On to the
turkeys.
<P>Buchholz took measurements of oxygen consumption, metabolic
rate and other parameters for eight wild turkeys placed in a
metabolic chamber at 0 degrees Celsius, 22 degrees C and 35
degrees C. Wild turkeys range from southern Mexico to the
Canadian-U.S. border and are exposed to at least this temperature
variation. Each bird had a second chamber experience while
wearing the socks, with large holes for the eyes and entire bill.
<P>Cold turkeys, and even warm turkeys, did not show significant
differences in their response to the socks. But at 35 degrees C,
the dressed turkeys had a much higher average metabolic rate and
far greater trouble dissipating heat through evaporation. (One
can scarcely imagine the problems head socking could cause at,
say, 350 degrees Fahrenheit for 20 minutes per pound.)
<P>The wild turkey thus becomes the first bird species for which
the value of the unfeathered head in thermoregulation, as opposed
to sexual selection, has been demonstrated experimentally. Of
course, a previous Buchholz study showed that what really
attracts female wild turkeys isn't primarily the male's bald
head, anyway. It's the length of his snood. But that's another
story.

<B>Galileo's Travels</B>
<P>Kicking off its tour of Jupiter's moons, the space probe
<I>Galileo</I> sent the first <A HREF="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/galileo/ganymede/g1images.html">close-up images</A> of Ganymede to
Earth in July. The pictures clearly reveal Ganymede's strange
face, scarred with icy mountains and unusual craters.
<I>Galileo'</I>s instruments also detected a magnetic field,
suggesting that a molten core or a buried saltwater sea lies
below the moon's surface. 
<P><HR><B>Growing Pains</B>
<P>Emotional problems can stunt more than intellectual and social
development. In a study of 716 children, girls diagnosed with
anxiety disorders or depression at puberty were, on average, one
to two inches shorter than less troubled youths. The link did not
hold true for boys, perhaps because depression and anxiety are
less common among them after childhood.
<P><HR><B>Free Bits</B>
<P>In a recent paper, renowned IBM computing expert Rolf Landauer
asserts that energy need not be spent in sending data. The
examples he gives are not practical. But they do demonstrate how,
in certain scenarios, the energy and matter used to transmit
information can be recycled. If he's right and no minimum energy
expenditure for communications exists, creating smaller, faster
circuits in the future will be all the more feasible.
<P><HR><B>First Drug for Stroke Approved</B>
<P>The Food and Drug Administration has at last approved Activase
for treating acute ischemic stroke within three hours of symptom
onset. In this variety of "brain attack," which accounts for 80
percent of all stroke cases, a clot cuts off the brain's blood
supply. Clinical trials showed that patients given Activase, an
anticlotting agent, were 33 percent more likely to survive having
minimal or no disability than patients given a placebo.
<P><HR><B>Long Days' Night</B>
<P>As the moon moves away from Earth, it is stretching out our
days, a team of scientists now reports. They measured the
microscopic thickness of ancient tidalites-sediments left by the
rise and fall of lunar tides-at several sites in the U.S. and
Australia. The results indicated that 900 million years ago,
during the Proterozoic era, days were only 18.2 hours long, and
years were 481 days long.
<P><HR><B>Some Flies Have All the Luck</B>
<P>Female fireflies, a new study shows, prefer flashy dates. Marc
A. Branham, then at the University of Kansas, analyzed videotape
of <I>Photinys consimilis </I>and built a robot to mimic the
bug's behavior. In the field, he found that the rate at which the
robot flashed-and not the brightness or color of its
light-determined its success with the fairer sex: the faster it
blinked, the more attractive it seemed.
<P><HR><B>Polar Surprise</B>
<P>New data are helping geologists characterize a body of water
that lies four kilometers below central East Antarctica's ice
sheet. Updated satellite measurements and radio-echo surveys show
that the submerged lake is about a million years old, fresh and
much bigger than anyone thought. In fact, its dimensions rival
those of Lake Ontario. Workers calculate that the lake has a mean
depth of at least 125 meters. Their next step may be sampling
these waters for signs of ancient microorganisms.
<P><HR><B>Pedal Medals</B>
<P>Bamboo bicycles may have been featured in every fashion
magazine this summer, but the Kangaroo, made from glass
fiber-reinforced composites, won first prize at a recent design
competition. The task Owens Corning's 1996 Global Design
Challenge gave to university students around the world was
simple: devise an affordable bicycle for developing nations that
rely heavily on two-wheeled transportation. The Kangaroo's
creators, seven students from the University of S&#227;o Paulo in
Brazil, will split a $10,000 prize with their school.
<P><HR><B>Ungulates Uncovered</B>
<P>This past spring paleontologists offered proof that
ungulates-hoofed vertebrates related to deer-lived before the
Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction, which wiped out the dinosaurs 65
million years ago. Eighty-five-million-year-old jaws and teeth,
clearly from an ungulate ancestor, surfaced in the former Soviet
Union.
<P><HR><B>Resistance through an Atom</B>
<P>Physicists at IBM have recently measured the ease with which
an electron travels through "wires" made from single or double
xenon atoms. To do so, they fixed the atoms to the tip of a
scanning tunneling microscope over a nickel surface. The results
showed that conductivity at this scale can depend heavily on the
quantum state of an individual atom. The electrical resistance
for one xenon atom (<I>photograph</I>) was 100,000 ohms. The
value shot up to 10 million ohms for two xenon atoms.

<B>Imanishi-Kari Cleared</B>
<P>This summer an appeals panel from the Department of Health and
Human Services (DHHS) found Tufts University professor Thereza
Imanishi-Kari not guilty of scientific misconduct. The
immunologist made headlines two years ago, when DHHS's Office of
Research Integrity charged her with fabricating data for a paper
she co-wrote with Nobelist David Baltimore in 1986. The new
ruling derails the proposed punishment: a 10-year freeze on
federal funding for Imanishi-Kari. (See January 1992, page 33.)
<P><HR><B>Sweeter Dreams</B>
<P>Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) has become 30 percent less
prevalent since 1994, reports D. Duane Alexander, director of the
National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. He
attributes the decline to the "Back to Sleep" campaign fostered
by the National Institutes of Health, which began in 1994 and
teaches parents and sitters that babies should sleep on their
backs or sides, not on their stomachs. (See August 1995, page

BIOTECHNOLOGY
<CENTER><H2>ARTIFICIAL BLOOD QUICKENS</H2>
Several short-term substitutes 
<BR>approach final clinical trials</CENTER>
<P>Beneath the surgeon's scalpel, life's fluid seeps into pools
to be sopped up by sponges and vacuumed into suction pumps. Some
of the effluence can be cleaned and returned to the body, but
much is lost. Every year roughly 100 million units of donated
blood trickle into patients. Recently a small but growing number
of pioneers have allowed something other than human red blood
cells to fill the bags hanging above their hospital gurneys. Some
patients have accepted into their veins protein solutions
extracted from cow's blood or fermented from genetically
engineered bacteria. In others, a Teflon-like solution has
displaced, for a few hours, up to 40 percent of the blood from
their vessels.
<P>This year at least six companies in the U.S. are testing
so-called blood substitutes in human surgeries. "Substitutes" is
perhaps too ambitious a label for these solutions, because none
can replace the clotting and infection-fighting abilities of
whole blood. But all six liquids can, like red blood cells, ferry
oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body and carry carbon
dioxide back. Two of the products are on track to enter final,
phase III clinical trials in hundreds of patients next year.
<P>The rush to produce alternatives to blood may seem oddly
timed. Tighter screening prompted by the emergence of HIV has
made the blood supply safer than it has ever been. Yet donation
levels have never recovered from the initial AIDS scare, and
blood banks face periodic regional shortages.
<P>"The main benefit of these products will be to reduce the
amount of donated blood a patient receives. That can minimize the
risk of infection [because the chemicals can be sterilized more
rigorously than blood] and will preserve blood for cases where it
is really needed," says Steven A. Gould, president of Northfield
Laboratories in Evanston, Ill.
<P>Synthetic substitutes should have other advantages as well.
All will stay fresh for six months or more; red blood cells go
bad within six weeks. And the artificial compounds bear none of
the proteins and sugars that coat blood cells and separate them
into eight distinct types. Theoretically, substitutes could be
pumped into anyone, without fear of provoking a serious allergic
reaction.
<P>Of course, doctors had the same hope back in 1868, when they
first extracted hemoglobin, the oxygen-bearing protein in red
blood cells. Hemoglobin failed as a blood replacement because it
works only when intact and when assisted by a cofactor found in
red blood cells. Stripped from its protective cell and its
molecular teammate, hemoglobin is quickly snipped in two by
enzymes, and the fragments can poison the kidneys.
<P>Biotechnology firms are now trying to solve the problems of
raw hemoglobin in two ways: avoiding it and altering it. Oily
chemicals called perfluorocarbons can mimic hemoglobin's actions
without its side effects. Alliance Pharmaceutical of San Diego
has begun small-scale, phase II trials to demonstrate the
effectiveness of one such candidate, called Oxygent. Volunteers
are drained of a few pints of blood, then given a partial
transfusion of the substance-a by-product of Teflon
manufacture-during surgery. Their own blood is returned at the
end of the operation. Alliance hopes to announce later this year
whether the procedure reduced patients' need for donated blood;
final trials could begin in early 1997.
<P>Other companies are trying to modify hemoglobin so that it
works without its cofactor and resists the body's attempt to
split it into toxic halves. That's a tall order, but a decade of
research has brought several groups tantalizingly close to
success.
<P>Baxter Healthcare in Deerfield, Ill., has completed five phase
II trials of HemAssist, which it makes by extracting hemoglobin
from outdated human blood and chemically binding its pieces
together with a derivative of aspirin. In June, Baxter became the
first company to win approval in the U.S. for a phase III trial
of its blood substitute. The firm started a similar trial last
year in Europe and has already begun building a factory to
produce the drug in Switzerland.
<P>Baxter won't be the only firm making modified hemoglobin.
Northfield presented dramatic, though statistically shaky,
results in May for its PolyHeme preparation. Ten trauma patients
given, on average, 4.6 units of PolyHeme during surgery required,
on average, 4.6 fewer units of donated blood. "Even more
important," Gould adds, "we've replaced up to 60 percent of the
blood volume in patients with PolyHeme, and we have yet to see
any adverse affects from the product." Northfield asked the Food
and Drug Administration in June to approve a phase III trial to
begin later this year.
<P>Thomas M. S. Chang of McGill University, who has worked on
blood substitutes since 1957, expects to see "several
substitutes, some better for certain situations than others."
Their prices may compete as well, so some biotechnology companies
are pursuing cheaper sources of hemoglobin. BioPure in Cambridge,
Mass., starts with cow's blood. Somatogen in Boulder, Colo.,
ferments its product, now in phase II trials, out of a
genetically modified strain of <I>E. coli </I>bacteria.
<P>If the thought of having genetically engineered goo injected
into your arteries makes your skin crawl, fret not: the
substitutes will simply be options available-at premium
prices-for those who cannot use their own previously stockpiled
blood and do not trust others'. Unfortunately, prospects are slim
that substitutes cheaper than blood will be able to address
perhaps the greatest need for them: saving lives on battlefields
and in hospitals in the more remote corners of the world where
blood shortages are chronic.

MARINE BIOLOGY
<CENTER><H2>ALARMING NETS</H2>
Fishermen try acoustics to protect porpoises</CENTER>
<P>In search of a fish dinner, harbor porpoises range quite close
to shore. Unfortunately, that behavior can send the creatures
into the nets of commercial fishermen plying the same waters. In
New England the death of harbor porpoises in nets set along the
bottom seemed so rampant that wildlife conservationists
petitioned the federal government in 1991 to designate the local
population as officially threatened. That move would have
severely restricted fishing in the region. But instead of
challenging the porpoise advocates in court, some fishermen
joined with scientists, engineers and environmentalists to find a
technical solution. That effort resulted in an underwater
acoustic alarm-a "pinger"-that keeps the porpoises from
entangling themselves. Yet, despite tests that have shown the
efficacy of these devices, many scientists have remained
frustratingly slow in blessing the pingers.
<P>The problem stemmed from a general belief among marine
biologists that acoustic deterrents were ineffective. An
influential review article published in 1991 in <I>Marine Mammal
Science </I>stated flatly that "studies undertaken to determine
whether sound emitters reduce entanglement have been
inconclusive, and have so far failed to demonstrate better than a
marginal reduction in entanglement rates, if any."
<P>But some fishermen, scientists and environmentalists felt
otherwise. "We had been blinded by the literature that said it
didn't work," admits Scott D. Kraus, a marine biologist at the
New England Aquarium in Boston. Nevertheless, some members of an
informal <A HREF="http://seagrant.gso.uri.edu/riseagrant/noreaster/bycatchrefs_barnaby.html">"harbor porpoise working group"</A> decided to approach Jon
Lien, a professor of animal behavior at Memorial University in
St. Johns, Newfoundland, who had been using acoustic devices to
prevent whales from colliding with fishing gear.
<P>With their first attempt at using Lien's pingers in 1992, the
fishermen saw a remarkable reduction in the entanglement of
harbor porpoises. Whereas a set of control nets without pingers
snared 10 harbor porpoises, the nets set with Lien's sounders
entangled none. Yet naysayers complained that the fishermen had
placed the pingers in areas they knew would be free from porpoise
traffic.
<P>So with $9,000 from the U.S. National Marine Fisheries
Service, Lien and the New England fishermen mounted a more
elaborate experiment in 1993, using new pingers that they
constructed on the spot. "We went to Radio Shack and got a sound
generator and went to a hardware store and got some plumbing,"
Lien recalls. They also deployed their test nets in an
arrangement that kept the control nets in proximity, avoiding the
possibility of experimenter bias. Again the results were
positive. Nets fully outfitted with pingers trapped only one
harbor porpoise; those without caught 32 of the animals.
<P>But critics once more found reason to question the experiment,
noting that some of the harbor porpoises had been trapped close
to the juncture between pinger-studded and pinger-free sides. A
panel of experts convened by the National Marine Fisheries
Service determined that the fishermen's experiments, though
promising, were inconclusive.
<P>Only a large-scale, statistically controlled experiment would
produce a definitive answer. So the porpoise working group
appealed to Congress for the necessary funds. Their lobbying
efforts included a refreshing twist: the fishermen in the group
argued on behalf of the endangered porpoises, and the
environmentalists present argued on behalf of the endangered New
England fishermen. That tactic startled Congress into approving a
large-scale study.
<P>During their 1994 trials, the group monitored more than 10,000
fishing nets, each as long as a football field. To rule out any
possibility of bias, all the nets were fitted with pingers, but
only half of them had sounders that were operative. Special
switches powered up the devices after they were cast overboard,
and thus the participants could not distinguish live pingers from
duds while deploying the nets.
<P>As the experiment progressed, it soon became clear that the
pingers were deterring porpoises. In the final count, 25
porpoises became entangled in the control nets, whereas only two
suffered in an equal number of nets outfitted with working
pingers-and one of those animals was most likely deaf. Moreover,
the acoustic beacons did not scare away the desired fish.
<P>The New England fishermen are now even more confident that the
harbor porpoise problem can be solved with pingers. Some
scientists and conservationists, however, remain cautious. David
N. Wiley, a senior scientist with the International Wildlife
Coalition in Massachusetts, for example, warns that the pingers
"have not been shown to be without detrimental 'side
effects'...." Other scientists question how effective the pingers
will prove to be during different seasons and over long periods.
<P>But like doctors who have observed positive results in
clinical trials, the fishermen are reluctant to continue running
tests. And they wonder why some scientists and government
regulators have been so slow to pay attention to
pingers-something even porpoises seem able to do.

BIOTECHNOLOGY
<CENTER><H2>NEW CHIP OFF THE OLD BLOCK</H2>
Can DNA microprobes 
<BR>do for genetics what microprocessors
<BR>did for computing?</CENTER>
<P>In 1971 a small company in Santa Clara, Calif., perfected a
way to shrink 2,300 transistors onto a single integrated circuit
and began selling the first microcomputer chips. Through mass
production, Intel made microprocessors affordable, launching the
personal-computer industry and a multibillion-dollar business.
Now, 25 years later, a small start-up just a few miles from Intel
headquarters has adapted the same production methods to fabricate
microchips that process DNA rather than electrons. <A HREF="http://www.biospace.com/g/synd/__b859458b/exhib_script/exhibitors/Affymetrix.html">Affymetrix</A>
claims its GeneChip systems can boost the field of genetic
medicine the same way desktop computers helped business: by
gathering information much more quickly and cheaply than
previously possible.
<P>Held in the hand, a GeneChip looks unremarkable. A simple
plastic case small enough to conceal in one's palm holds a glass
slide the size of a small postage stamp, on the inside of which
is a dull, dark coating. But given a drop of blood and a few
hours, a GeneChip system can reveal not only whether a subject
has HIV but also whether the particular strain of the
AIDS-causing virus in his or her body carries mutations that make
it resistant to certain drugs. With a different chip (each costs
only a few dollars to mass-produce), the same system can screen
for any of the 450 or so mutations linked to cystic fibrosis. In
contrast, standard genetic testing would take 12 hours to screen
an HIV sample and perhaps a week to search for all the genetic
risk factors for cystic fibrosis.
<P>"We're approaching the postgenome world where we know the
sequence of all human genes," says David J. Lockhart, senior
scientist at Affymetrix. "The chip allows us to quickly lay down
probes that scan thousands of these sequences at once and reveal
overnight not only whether they contain mutations but also how
strongly the genes are expressed. In essence, it reduces hundreds
of experiments down to one."
<P>Such economies of scale are possible because of Affymetrix's
clever adaptation of photolithography, the technique routinely
used to make semiconductors. Instead of projecting ultraviolet
light through a series of masks to etch multilayered circuits
into silicon, Affymetrix's machines use the masks to build
chainlike DNA sequences that rise from a glass wafer. Each mask
limits where new links are attached, so adjacent chains can
contain completely different combinations of the four DNA
building blocks, called bases. In 32 steps, the automated process
can create on a single chip up to 65,536 unique probes, each
eight bases long. "We expect [the number of probes] to rise to
400,000 within a year or two," says Robert J. Lipshutz, the
company's director of advanced technology. "We have actually
produced a prototype chip containing a million probes."
<P>Reading the results of thousands of micron-size experiments
requires a little preparation. First the unknown DNA to be tested
is extracted from blood or tissue cells, unzipped from its double
helix into separate strands, then chopped into fragments.
Fluorescent molecules are attached to the fragments before they
are pumped underneath the glass slide in the chip, where they
flow over the probes, sticking to any that mimic the opposite
strand from which they were separated. Fragments that find no
mate are simply washed away.
<P>Once the bonding is completed, a technician moves the chip
into a reader. There a laser scans the slide row by row, exciting
the fluorescent molecules. Peering through a high-powered
microscope, a computer records the pattern of bright and dim
blocks, indicating which probes found matching DNA in the test
sample. Comparing the pattern to a map of known probe locations,
the system can reconstruct the unknown genetic sequence.
<P>In April, Affymetrix began selling the GeneChip system with
its first commercial chip, a test for AIDS research that can
identify any of the mutations within HIV associated with its drug
resistance. "We don't know enough yet about the genetic evolution
of HIV to use this for clinical decisions," says Thomas R.
Gingeras, the firm's director of molecular biology. "But the test
is helping us to acquire that knowledge quickly." Several other
chips are being developed as well, including one that will be
able to screen a gene called <I>p53</I> for more than 400 known
mutations that are closely associated with many types of cancer.
<P>Designing a chip for each new test does require time and
skill-although it is significantly easier than designing a new
microprocessor. But once the design is finished, production is
almost completely automated. And because the chips vary only in
the arrangement and length of the probes, all tests can be
performed and read using the same equipment.
<P>Officials at Affymetrix, aware of the controversy over genetic
screening, emphasize that they will be selling their systems to
research groups, not to hospitals and clinical laboratories. But
a prospectus the company issued before its first public stock
offering in June stated that "the company's longer-term strategy
is to seek regulatory approval for and to commercialize GeneChip
systems as diagnostic tests for clinical use." Clearly,
Affymetrix is betting that the GeneChip will do for its bottom
line what the microprocessor did for Intel's.

Privacy While You're Connected.</CENTER>
<P>If you prefer privacy when you telephone from your desktop or
notebook computer, consider <A HREF="http://web.mit.edu/network/pgpfone">PGPfone</A>, a software package that
permits a secure telephone conversation, modem to modem or on the
Internet. The package, which combines cryptographic protocols and
speech compression, is the creation of Phil Zimmermann, who is
also the author of the popular program Pretty Good Privacy (PGP).
(PGP-its name is a linguistic cousin of Ralph's Pretty Good
Grocery, found on Garrison Keillor's radio show "A Prairie Home
Companion"-uses encryption to protect the security of e-mail and
of files stored on a computer.) Unlike steganography, which might
conceal a telephone conversation as background noise in a
digitized sound file, PGPfone makes no secret that the message is
encoded. "We encrypt the data string," Zimmermann says. "Anyone
can tell there is traffic. They just can't decrypt it."
<P><B>These Key Words for Hire.</B>
<P>The Internet is becoming so commercialized that even key
words-the entries typed in on search engines-are up for sale.
IBM, for instance, has bought the words "Lou Gerstner" on the
search service Excite. Type "Lou Gerstner," and Excite may
respond not only with citations but with a sparkling blue
advertisement for IBM (Gerstner is the head of IBM). Another
search service, Lycos, has gone a step further: it sells key
words to competitors. Type "Windows 95," and you might see a
vibrant ad for IBM's rival operating system, OS/2.
<P>Sales of key words are the latest attempts by search services
to generate revenue. Excite, InfoSeek, Lycos, Magellan and Yahoo
each paid $5 million to Netscape to be featured choices, boosting
advertising sales for the search companies. In a recent quarter,
Lycos sold more than $1 million in advertisements, according to
Lycos vice president Bill Townsend. The company rotates the 120
million ads it shows a month so that 10 different ads appear per
second.

CRYPTOGRAPHY
<CENTER><H2>FOR YOUR EYES ONLY?</H2>
"Strong crypto" puts federal controls under pressure</CENTER>
<P>Rendering electronic messages into unbreakable code
is-depending on your point of view-either the ultimate guarantee
of privacy from snoopers or the stock-in-trade of Internet-savvy
terrorists, drug smugglers and other villains. As the computer
industry has sought to exploit the growing global market for
encryption, the U.S. government has been building a wall to stem
the tide, limiting exports of programs or devices that encrypt
well enough to stymie code breakers at the National Security
Agency.
<P>The dam is starting to crack. The latest embarrassment for
federal policy is <A HREF="http://www.rsa.com/">RSA Data Security</A>, the Redwood City, Calif.,
firm that holds patents on the widely used "public key"
encryption technique. RSA's recently established Japanese
subsidiary, Nihon RSA, has licensed rights for RSA encryption to
the Japanese communications giant NTT. The NTT chip offers far
more powerful encryption than any chip that can be exported from
the U.S. Exportable RSA products are in general limited to
512-bit keys, which are crackable by an expert with a powerful
computer. The new NTT chip, which has a 1,024-bit key and could
be used with even longer keys, is in the uncrackable realm.
<P>D. James Bidzos, RSA's president, predicts healthy sales for
the NTT chip, which the firm is authorized to sell in the U.S. as
well as other countries. He expects to see it in high-speed
Internet links as well as in private networks such as those
maintained by banks. Smaller versions, Bidzos foresees, will be
incorporated in "smart" cards that 21st-century shoppers and
travelers will use.
<P>Nihon RSA is not the only overseas source of RSA encryption
technology, Bidzos points out: manufacturers in Germany and the
Netherlands are making equivalent devices. But Bidzos says the
future for cryptography looks particularly bright in Japan, where
encryption is aggressively promoted by MITI, the national
technology ministry. The increasing availability of "strong
crypto," including cryptographic software available on the
Internet, means "the pressure is starting to build" to change
U.S. export controls, Bidzos argues.
<P>U.S. chipmakers could manufacture devices like the new NTT
chip for the domestic market, but export controls limit sales to
overseas markets. (There are exceptions to the 512-bit key limit
for specific areas, such as finance.) Bidzos and the U.S.
Association for Computing Machinery both support legislation
sponsored by Senator Conrad Burns of Montana that would roll back
current restrictions. A recent study by the National Research
Council also recommended that export controls be progressively
relaxed, though not eliminated.
<P>The administration appears to be feeling the heat. One
high-ranking official says some relaxation of current export
regulations-including expansion of both approvable destinations
and exempted applications-could occur as soon as this fall. But
in exchange, he adds, industry must agree to pilot-scale trials
of a scheme that would allow the government to gain access to
keys for law-enforcement purposes.
<P>In 1994 the administration failed to win support for a
proposal advocating that companies use a special "clipper chip"
for their cryptography and deposit keys with federal officials.
The latest scheme involves persuading companies to deposit keys
for their encryption systems with a "trusted" nongovernmental
organization. This party would promise to turn keys over to
federal investigators on receipt of a court order.
<P>Civil libertarians are not much happier with the present
proposal than they were with the clipper-chip idea. But according
to the administration official, staff-level representatives from
the nations of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development recently backed the principle of surrendering keys to
third parties. Will industry trade users' privacy for larger
markets?

Envisioning Speech</CENTER>
<P><A HREF="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/People/raman/raman.html">T. V. Raman</A> wants to show me what he has been building on the
nights and weekends when he is not working as a senior computer
scientist at Adobe Systems. So I have come down to his apartment
in Mountain View, Calif., to watch him play. As we sit in his
spartan living room, decorated only with a NordicTrack, a
partially solved five-by-five Rubik's Cube (adorned with Braille
stickers) and a single framed poster of wolves, Raman powers up
his laptop. The device comes to life with what sounds to my ears
to be a string of alien gibberish, like a compact disc on fast
forward. Raman smiles: to the blind engineer, that is the sweet
sound of connection. "I've gotten used to the thing talking very,
very fast. It keeps me efficient," he chuckles, before slowing
the speech rate down by about half so that I can follow along.
Gibberish turns to stilted, robotic English-a voice familiar to
me as that of Stephen W. Hawking, the renowned physicist, who
uses the same type of synthesizer.
<P>Feeling around the cushions of his couch for a telephone cord,
Raman plugs in his modem and dials up his workstation at Adobe.
As his hands fly over the keys, the movements of this 31-year-old
immigrant from Pune, India, remind me of a virtuoso pianist. Each
stroke elicits a distinct sound as his synthesizer intones a
cacophony of letters, words, chords. Cowbells jangle when the
computer has a question or a suggestion for him. As his World
Wide Web browser loads, Bach's toccata and fugue plays. Within a
minute or two, Raman is scanning the latest headlines from CNN
and checking out hot stocks at the <I>Wall Street Journal.
</I>His expression betrays a giddy adoration for this technology.
<P>Raman can be forgiven a touch of nerdy technophilia, for
without his work, it would be tedious if not impossible for the
blind to do these things with a computer. Software he designed
enables the sightless to read mathematical and scientific papers,
to surf the Internet and to write their own programs almost as
efficiently as the sighted do. Raman's ideas may soon find their
place in the mainstream as well: his research for Digital
Equipment and Adobe is wending its way toward the marketplace.
<P>The path from Pune to Mountain View could not have been easy
for Raman, but he waves off suggestions that he has overcome any
great handicap. Glaucoma dimmed Raman's sight gradually during
childhood. "By age 14, I couldn't see anything," he states
without any hint of bitterness. The baby in a middle-class family
of six, Raman-whose initials stand, respectively, for his
hometown and his father's name-showed an early affinity for
mathematics. He majored in the subject at the University of Pune,
then applied for a master's program in math and computer science
at the Indian Institute of Technology-the first blind student
ever to do so. "I convinced the dean to allow students to satisfy
their national social service requirement by reading the screen
for me," Raman recounts. "I had to line up 13 students each
semester."
<P>At Cornell University, where he did his doctoral work, Raman
got his first speech synthesizer, along with the most advanced
screen-reading software then available: it simply spoke the text
on display. "Imagine working with a one-line, 40-character
display, instead of a nice, big 60-line monitor. That's what
you're fighting against when you use a speech interface," Raman
says animatedly. Worse than the tedium, the device rendered many
of the mathematics texts Raman needed to read unintelligible.
"Most of these papers were written in LaTeX [a notation used to
typeset texts containing equations or symbols]. The program would
come upon the code for an equation and start saying, 'Backslash
backslash x caret something'-it was ridiculous," he laughs. "So I
decided to write a nice weekend hack that would read LaTeX to me
sensibly."
<P>Mukkai S. Krishnamoorthy, a computer science professor at
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, was taking his sabbatical at
Cornell at the time. "Raman was working on a very ambitious
thesis topic," he recalls. "He wanted to design a robotic guide
dog that could navigate using the Global Positioning System. But
it was going slowly, so I suggested he focus instead on improving
computers' reading abilities."
<P>Raman followed that advice as well as a clever approach
suggested by David Gries: he constructed a high-level programming
language that can control the way certain phrases and
mathematical expressions are spoken by the synthesizer. Then he
added a system that can take a file formatted in LaTeX, analyze
it and render it aurally. Raman designed his program to translate
the visual structure and style of the text into intuitive audio
cues. Italicized passages can be read louder than normal. Chapter
headings might be read by a baritone voice, footnotes by a
soprano. A short tone could precede each item in a bulleted list.
<P>Raman named the system AsTeR, ostensibly for "Audio System for
Technical Readings," but actually after the frisky black Labrador
that has guided him for six years.  AsTeR's power lies in its
ability to browse quickly through complicated material. Whereas
one can skim through a book, find a page of interest and take in
tables, fractions and integrals at a glance, audio is
frustratingly linear. Yet it need not be one-dimensional. "If you
have CNN on in the other room, you can always tell when the
financial news is on-they play a distinctive noise in the
background," Raman points out.  AsTeR uses similar techniques to
help listeners keep track of where they are. It also allows the
hearer to interrupt its monologue and skip to another section.
<P>Complex mathematical expressions can sound ambiguous or
incomprehensibly long even when read aloud by experts. AsTeR
relies on aural tricks to do the job. To speak the program uses
successively higher-pitched voices, rather than verbose
descriptions, to indicate the nested exponentials. When reading
tables or matrices, it can pan the sound left and right to convey
the position of each value. Most important, it can create all its
audio cues from unembellished LaTeX documents written by authors
who have never heard of AsTeR, and readers can customize AsTeR's
cues. Fittingly, Recording for the Blind and Dyslexic in
Princeton, N.J., used AsTeR to read Raman's thesis onto tape, the
organization's first fully synthesized recording.
<P>Although AsTeR helped Raman read and write technical papers,
it did nothing to simplify the more pedestrian functions of his
computer. The need for a better speech interface became even more
pressing when Raman left Cornell to join Digital Equipment's
Cambridge Research Lab. "A colleague, Dave Wecker, prodded me to
apply the principles of AsTeR to a more general computer
interface," Raman recounts. "But the challenge is that even
though your program may know what is on the screen, that screen
is not a simple paragraph of text but a complicated display with
title bars and menu bars and scroll bars and messages popping up
and cursors bouncing around. The amount of information is huge.
<P>"I figured I'd build something quickly on top of Emacs [a
text-based UNIX interface] to run on my laptop. After a few days,
I had a first version that did almost nothing: it would just read
the line beneath the cursor. But then I built an extension for
the calendar, and I finally figured out that this approach could
improve my life a hell of a lot."
<P>To demonstrate why, Raman grabs his laptop. Aster (the dog)
plops her head in my lap, and Raman scratches her back as he
fires up the calendar. "Now," he says, moving the cursor to the
beginning of a week, "this is how a screen reader interprets the
calendar." The voice begins reading the numbers in the row of
boxes, "Eight, nine, ten, eleven...." Raman cuts it off, giggling
at its inanity. "Useless. A more natural way to convey the same
information is like this." Another keystroke, and the computer
intones the cursor's position as he has taught it to: "Wednesday,
May 1, 1996."
<P>"Now the text of what it said does not appear on the screen,"
Raman explains. "In fact, the program did not refer to the screen
at all." Raman has exploited a way to modify the behavior of
programs without changing the programs themselves. "Emacs allows
you to 'advise' a function to run extra code after it is
finished. So I simply advise the calendar to speak the complete
date whenever I reposition the cursor. The great thing is," he
says, exploding with enthusiasm, "the guy who wrote the calendar
function has no idea I've done this, and when he releases a new
version of the software, the speech enhancements will still work.
It's a perfect parasite."
<P>Bit by bit, Raman added speaking capabilities to other Emacs
programs, such as the tools he uses to write and test software.
"A lot of people in the lab, including myself, started using
tools that he was evangelizing," Wecker reports. "They were
necessary for him, but they were improvements for us, because
they allow you to collapse subroutines, even whole programs into
outline form." Raman adapted a public-domain browser for the Web
to use his interface and distributes Emacspeak free on the
Internet.
<P>Meanwhile others are weaving new products from threads of his
invention. Krishnamoorthy built a prototype Web service at
Rensselaer that can run AsTeR for those who are unable to. "You
simply paste the document to be read into a form, then the server
processes it and sends you back a file for your speech
synthesizer," the professor explains. Unfortunately, the project
has been halted for lack of funding.
<P>Since 1994 the Science Accessibility Project, led by John
Gardner of Oregon State University, has continued to develop
AsTeR. "Raman really pioneered this area of audio formatting,"
says Gardner, who is also blind. "The [audio-enhanced] Web
browser is so much better than anything else I could possibly
use. But there is still an awful lot to be done." Gardner's group
just released a graphing calculator for the blind; he says the
next version will use audio formatting. "If we can develop audio
formatting for math and science, we can do it for bloody well
anything," Gardner says.
<P>Whether that includes mainstream applications remains to be
seen. Raman is not leaving the matter to chance. He is working
with Adobe to incorporate audio formatting into its popular
portable document format, and he is a frequent speaker at
conferences on the future of computer interfaces. On the
Internet, he seems omnipresent, adding to his inventions, pushing
the boundaries of technology and persuasively arguing for
standards that will ensure that the flood of information raises
all boats.

Of all the students in Mrs. Nickle's first-grade class, none
had a more refined appreciation of pollywogs than I. Our teacher
kept the school aquarium full of local pond life, and the class
delighted in observing the steady metamorphosis of tadpoles to
frogs. As the official pollywog monitor (a job I begged for and
got, much to my mother's horror), I was responsible for replacing
the amphibians that made the leap. I still remember those sunny
spring afternoons when, sporting my oversized safari hat and
carting a satchel brimming over with empty mayonnaise jars, I
trekked to our nearby pond intent on bagging a "gazillion"
tadpoles.
<P>For me, and I suspect for most amateur naturalists, ponds
remain a treasure trove of wonders. There are four spheres of
life around a country pond: the water itself, the mud beneath the
water, the air above it and the soil around it. A myriad of
creatures have evolved to exploit these special habitats. Water
snails stealthily patrol the bottom. Toads hunt insects and their
own smaller brethren in nightly melees along the banks.
Dragonflies skim the surface to deposit their payloads of eggs.
If you're lucky, you'll spy minnows, newts and diving beetles
taking refuge among the aquatic plants.
<P>Most nature books wax verbose on the habits of local species
but are disappointingly terse in the how-to details of specimen
collection and preservation. The shining exception to this gloomy
rule is Gerald Durrell's marvelous practical guide, <I>The
Amateur Naturalist</I> (David McKay Company, Random House, 1989,
$25, ISBN 0-679-72837-6). This book once so invigorated my
excitement for ecology that I almost abandoned my graduate
studies in physics to become a professional naturalist. Most
collection methods I've developed, including those described
here, are merely refinements on techniques I first learned in the
pages of <I>The Amateur Naturalist. </I>Armed with these methods
and a good field guide, an ambitious amateur can delight in and
advance the study of pond ecology.
<P>(City dwellers, take heart. Although not as diverse as the
perennial country pond, any standing pool of water will, if left
alone for a month, become home to a surprising number of living
things, such as algae and water insects. Natural streams from
heavy rains often bubble up in the heart of urban sprawl, and
pools along storm drains are regularly replenished with runoff.
Perhaps you can let a wading pool go native. And there are almost
certainly ponds, lakes and reservoirs within an easy drive.)
<P>Like moths to flame, some inhabitants of the murky depths are
attracted to light. You can catch many of these critters using
the light-baited trap shown above. A flashlight is safely housed
inside a sealed glass jar and placed within a simple trap. The
funnel opening guides creatures in. Once inside, they have little
chance of finding their way out again.
<P>I've used wastebaskets and large-diameter aluminum pipes for
the trap's main chamber. You can fashion the funnel out of an old
white T-shirt and coat-hanger wire. Situate the flashlight to
illuminate the cloth opening. Put the trap in the pond before
sunset and hoist it up later that evening to examine your catch.
<P>As a variation, try building a circuit that flashes the light.
Plans appear in <I>Getting Started in Electronics, </I>by Forrest
M. Mims III (Radio Shack, $4.99). I've always wanted to build
such a circuit to see which species come calling when lured by a
pulsating invitation, but I haven't managed to get to it. You can
also experiment with different pulse frequencies. Let me know
what you find.

</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>A homemade grappling hook is invaluable for snagging aquatic
plants. The tines can be fashioned from coat-hanger wire. Use
insulated electrical wire to lash the tines to the end of some
nylon cord. Next, saturate the electrical-wire wrappings with a
generous layer of epoxy and let it set. Wrap the assembly with
duct tape and slide a narrow piece of plastic pipe over it for
protection. Finally, seal out debris by filling the pipe with
epoxy. Deploy the grapple by swinging it around your head and
letting it fly into a shallow of water plants. Then pull the
plants toward you. You might also find some interesting guests on
the fronds and stems.
<P>To examine bottom-dwelling life, you'll need a dredge net.
Purchase 54 inches of three-quarter-inch diameter plastic
polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe from a plumbing supplier and cut it
into three 18-inch lengths. Next, you'll need nylon fishnetting.
Some fabric stores and bait-and-tackle shops carry it (look under
"Netting" in the Yellow Pages). The size of the mesh is not
critical. I buy three-quarter-inch web (diamond-shaped netting)
for 32 cents per square foot. It comes in bolts 20 feet wide by
300 feet long, although you will need only a 60- by 60-inch
square. Retailers are usually happy to trim it. From the square,
cut out an equilateral triangle 60 inches to each side.

</CENTER>
Using an old paintbrush, liberally coat one of the PVC pipes
with one-hour epoxy. Place the pipe at one base of the triangular
netting and carefully draw in the netting along both sides,
leaving clear one inch of pipe at either end. Roll the netting
around the pipe twice. Stitch the netting in place with a couple
of twist ties so the pipe won't unroll. Then hang the pipe over
some old newspapers and pour on more of the one-hour epoxy,
thoroughly covering the pipe.
<P>Split lengthwise three 14-inch sections of garden hose. These
protect the net while it is being dragged. Slip one of the split
lengths of hose over the pipe. Hose clamps will clasp the
assembly tight while the epoxy sets, but they are a pain to
attach. I prefer to smother the assembly under plastic trash bags
filled with sand. Repeat the same procedure with the two other
pipes, rolling them up on the other sides of the triangular net.
You will end up with a dredge net about 28 inches deep and 18
inches to a side. Next, fill one of the pipes with sand and cap
the ends with cotton wadding soaked in epoxy. This weighted side
drags along the bottom.
<P>Now you need to link the pipes together to form a rigid frame.
From a plumbing supply store, purchase a short length of
one-half-inch flexible (L soft) copper tubing and six unthreaded
bell reducers. They are fittings that join two different size
pipes-in this case, they should connect three-quarter-inch pipe
to one-half-inch pipe. Cut a two-and-a-half-inch section off the
copper tubing and thread two bell reducers over the ends of the
cut piece so the fittings are separated by about a half inch.
Epoxy the bell reducers into place with low-viscosity aluminized
epoxy-available from Devcon in Danvers, Mass.; call (508)
777-1100 for the nearest distributor. Before gluing, be sure to
roughen the ends of the tube and the inside surfaces of the bell
reducers with coarse sandpaper.
<P>Once secured, bend the tubing to form a 60-degree angle. You
can make the bent tube rigid by filling it completely with epoxy
and letting it set. Use a knife to score the ends of two adjacent
sections of pipe and epoxy the bell reducers over the ends
(again, use aluminized epoxy). Repeat the entire procedure twice
to finish the rest of the frame. Paint the copper tubings to
prevent corrosion.
<P>The dragline completes the assembly. Tie eight inches of nylon
cord to each point where a bell reducer meets a PVC pipe, then
tie the opposite ends to form three pairs. Melt these ends
together with a soldering iron. Tie these three points with nylon
cord so they come together about two and a half feet in front of
the assembly. Finally, tie this point off to at least 100 feet of
nylon line. Make sure to adjust the cords so that the opening of
the net tips backward about 10 degrees when dragged.
<P>The soil around a pond is host to millions of tiny roundworms
called nematodes. Only about one millimeter long, these nearly
microscopic organisms are second only to protozoans as the most
abundant creatures on the earth. A cubic meter of soil can harbor
12 million of them. A vital part of pond ecology, they can be
especially interesting to study. Just make sure you observe
strict sanitary practices-ingested, a few species are parasitic.
Wear rubber gloves and wash thoroughly after field trips.
<P>To collect nematodes, slip a small piece of rubber surgical
tubing over the end of a funnel and clamp the opening shut with a
clothespin. Place muddy soil into the funnel, pouring in enough
pond water so that some water stands free on the soil surface.
The nematodes will sink into the funnel's neck. Wait five minutes
before disgorging your booty into a container with a few gentle
shakes and a momentary release of the clothespin.
<P>A similar technique enables you to collect insects from most
soils. Carpet the bottom of a glass jar with blotting paper.
Insert a funnel, neck downward, into the jar's mouth and loosely
fill the funnel with collected soil. Place a bright, incandescent
desk lamp directly over the soil. To escape the light and heat,
the insects will tunnel deeper into the soil until they fall onto
the blotting paper. Try conducting an insect and nematode census
around a pond at different times of the year.
<P>There are a few rules that all naturalists must follow. Never
enter private property without permission. Never disturb
protected or endangered marshlands. Never collect specimens in
excess of your immediate needs. Clear your activities with
whatever authority may be responsible for the area. If you study
more than one pond, wash your equipment thoroughly with soap and
water to prevent transplanting microscopic organisms. Remember,
violating these rules will not only make things hard on you.
Landowners and park authorities may begin forbidding access to
all amateur naturalists, even those whose only wish is to study
the ecology responsibly.

<CENTER><H2>MORAL KIN?</H2>
<P>Review by William C. McGrew</CENTER>
<P><B>GOOD NATURED: THE ORIGINS OF RIGHT AND WRONG IN HUMANS AND OTHER ANIMALS </B>
<BR><I>by Frans De Waal. Harvard University Press, 1996 ($24.95)</I>
<P>Morality puts individuals into conflict with the community:
collective needs, set out as rules of right and wrong, constrain
the options of individuals striving for their own best advantage.
Yet modern Darwinian evolutionary theory is based on individual
reproduction, on "selfish" genes that have been selected at the
expense of others that might act for the greater good. How then
could survival of the fittest lead to empathy? Despite the
insights of sociobiologists, this profound paradox has led some
scholars in the past to assume that the emergence of morals must
be a transcendent process beyond the bounds of scientific
explanation.
<P>Frans de Waal, one of the world's best-known primatologists,
has set out to prove that assumption wrong. On the final page of
his startling new book, he asserts that "we seem to be reaching a
point at which science can wrest morality from the hands of
philosophers." How the author, a Dutch-born zoologist now at
Emory University and the Yerkes Regional Primate Research Center
in Atlanta, Ga., came to this conclusion makes for compelling
reading.
<P>De Waal starts by examining the apparent universality of moral
systems across humanity; given that all societies have ethics,
ethics must be integral to human nature. Any phenomenon that is
part of human nature must be a product of both nature (evolution)
and nurture (culture). Therefore, if morality has an evolutionary
component, he argues, it must have its roots in prehuman species,
in which the precursors of morality provided the raw material
that natural selection acted on in the process of human origins.
These ancestral life-forms are extinct, but closely related
species are available for study.
<P>In <I>Good Natured, </I>de Waal looks to other primates in
particular to model the emergence of morality, to "investigate
the extent to which aspects of morality are recognizable in other
animals, and try to illuminate how we may have moved from
societies in which things were as they were to societies with a
vision of how things ought to be." He sets out not only to
compare nonhuman beings with humans but also to explain how the
former evolved into the latter.
<P>De Waal likens the question of morals in other species to
similar inquiries about culture, politics, language, intelligence
and so on. Of course, other species do not have human morals,
culture or language, any more than a cat has the same view of
life as a dog. Yet animals do behave in ways that, if seen in
humans, would be automatically credited as having a moral basis:
they appear to express altruism, empathy, righteous indignation,
retribution, community concern and tolerance.
<P>But are the acts of other animals motivated by something
resembling moral concerns, or is any such belief just a replay of
romantic 19th-century anthropomorphism? De Waal argues that
modern ethological methods of observation, combined with
evolutionary theory focusing on the proximate causes of behavior
(rather than its ultimate functions), allow us to understand much
more than previous generations of animal behaviorists. By
limiting the scope of inquiry, researchers can attain greater
certainty about the questions they do answer.
<P>The key to this certainty lies in explicit and precise
definition of terms, so that investigators can make testable
predictions instead of adding multiple layers of interpretation
to everything they watch. For example, de Waal carefully defines
an "expectation": "familiarity with a particular outcome to the
degree that a different outcome has an unsettling effect, as
reflected in confusion, surprise, or distress." The mental state
is inferred on the basis of observable acts, and almost anyone
who sees a primate's behavior in a particular situation will be
able to tell whether its expectations were met. This ingenuity
emerges again and again in de Waal's arguments, lending them
crucial credibility.
<P>So what are the basic conditions necessary for the evolution
of morals? De Waal postulates two: an organism must live in
groups on which it depends for subsistence and defense, and these
group members must cooperate even though they also have disparate
individual interests. A school of fish will satisfy the first
condition, but only a few species of social mammals (among them
carnivores, cetaceans and primates) meet the second one. It is
from the resolution of conflicts that morality emerges.
<P>De Waal adduces a strong body of evidence that humans and
other animals share the following tendencies and capacities:
sympathy as expressed in succor, special treatment of the
disadvantaged, and cognitive empathy; norms exemplified in both
prescriptive and proscriptive social rules; reciprocity embodied
positively in the exchange of services and balanced negatively by
the punishment of violators; and concern for community, which
finds its expression in peacemaking and negotiation. Summed up in
this way, the above suite of demonstrated qualities sounds moral
indeed.
<P>Lest the reader begin to perceive stereotyped visions of the
"noble ape" from the pages of Edgar Rice Burroughs, I should
point out that <I>Good Natured</I> is not without its
limitations. De Waal himself studies only monkeys and apes
confined in zoos or laboratories-animals whose existence is
different in almost all respects from that of their free-living
counterparts. By definition, such experimental subjects do not
escape from predators, hunt for prey or search for food. Most
important, they do not have the chance to be alone, whether
temporarily on any given day or more enduringly over their
lifetime.
<P>Take chimpanzees, de Waal's favored species of study and
humankind's nearest living relations. In nature, they are
actually among the least social species of primates. At Gombe
(Jane Goodall's famous site in Tanzania), Stewart Halperin found
that adult males spent an average 30 percent of their waking
hours alone, and mothers and their offspring spent 65 percent on
their own.
<P>Captive groups-animals living at best in large enclosures, and
often in confined cages-are constantly in one another's presence.
Any immigration or emigration is under the control of their human
caretakers, and there are no intermediate states-the ape is
either in or out. This social hothouse presents a real challenge,
and the chimpanzees respond with ingenious social adaptations
that are unknown in the wild. For example, adult females may form
coalitions that can put even the most dominant male to flight. As
de Waal notes, such behavior is unnatural, but it demonstrates
the latent reserves of adaptive complexity and capacity that
these apes possess.
<P>This kind of social situation, and the moral choices that the
apes make when confronted with it, probably sheds little light on
the evolutionary past of either humans or chimpanzees. Our
ancestors and theirs never faced such crowded conditions.
Nevertheless, it can provide information that confirms and
refines models drawn from behavior in the wild. De Waal is in the
same position as an anthropologist trying to make deductions
about <I>Homo sapiens</I> from observations of travelers
suffering from jet lag: however relevant the condition is today,
it cannot be of evolutionary significance, because our ancestors
never faced rapid global travel as a selection pressure. Even so,
responses to jet lag can yield insight into adaptational
limits-as well as unexpected knowledge, such as a better
understanding of the function of melatonin in modulating patterns
of sleep and waking.
<P>The most important implication of the book is the one with
which de Waal concludes: if we must now add morality to the list
of capacities shown by monkeys and apes, then questions about the
morality of our own behavior toward them become even more
pointed. Nonhuman moral creatures should be preserved in nature
and treated better in captivity. For apes, de Waal calls for
special consideration-either phase out experimentation on them
altogether or at least enrich their lives and reduce their
suffering. It is the moral thing to do.

<CENTER><H2>THE MISMEASURE OF RISK</H2>
Review by Michael A. Kamrin</CENTER>
<BR><P><B>OUR STOLEN FUTURE</B>
<BR><I>By Theo Colborn, Dianne Dumanoski And John Peterson Myers. Dutton, 1996 ($24.95)</I>
<P><I>Our Stolen Future</I> hit the bookshelves accompanied by a
whirlwind of publicity about the putative health impacts of
environmental contaminants-specifically, a class of compounds
that may mimic the chemical activities of estrogen. These
hormonal mimics are being blamed for declining fertility and
behavioral changes in species as disparate as humans, polar
bears, beluga whales and alligators. Although the book bills
itself as a "scientific detective story," a careful examination
shows that it falls short of the scientific ideal in a number of
ways. Its logical shortcomings are all too familiar from the many
recent attempts to explain risks to public health from
environmental contaminants.
<P>The book is not scientific in the most fundamental sense,
because it aims to convince readers about what ought to be rather
than to explain what is or what is likely to be. Although <I>Our
Stolen Future </I>includes results and interpretations of
scientific studies, its goal is to arouse public outrage and
change public policy in a manner that the authors believe is
correct.
<P>The authors present a very selective segment of the data that
have been gathered about chemicals that might affect hormonal
functions. They carefully avoid evidence and interpretations that
are not in accord with their thinking. For example, they cite
articles that document falling sperm counts and rising rates of
prostate cancers, but they do not mention equally reputable work
that casts doubt on these supposed trends. Yet nature's puzzles
can be solved only by looking at all the pieces.
<P>The book is not unique in providing information that simulates
the qualities of science yet does not adhere to its rules of
rigor. Other environmental risks have also been presented in
misleading or incomplete ways-consider the scare about Alar, a
pesticide formerly used on fruit. The Natural Resources Defense
Council (NRDC) claimed that 6,000 preschoolers might get cancer
from exposure to pesticides (mainly Alar) on fruits and
vegetables, an assertion that later proved to be unwarranted.
<P>The NRDC estimate was in part based on government approaches
to estimating cancer potency, so it is worth closely examining
the risk assessment process used by the federal government in
deciding how to regulate chemicals. It appears that this process
has some characteristics that resemble those found in the book.
Like the authors of <I>Our Stolen Future, </I>risk assessors are
selective in the data they use. Maximum allowable levels of
chemicals in drinking water rely on tests conducted on the most
sensitive animal species. Similarly, government classification of
chemicals as probable human carcinogens gives much greater weight
to studies that find excess cancers than to those that do not.
<P>During the past decade, many environmental groups have made
claims in which policy masquerades as science. The National
Wildlife Federation asserted that the PCBs and other compounds in
one meal a month of large lake trout from the Great Lakes carried
about a one-in-100 risk of cancer, showing how risk assessment
techniques can be manipulated to produce shocking values that are
misleadingly represented as scientific estimates. (The authors of
<I>Our Stolen Future</I> purvey similar scaremongering about
Great Lakes fish.) Both the public and policymakers reacted to
many of these claims as if they were accurate, although later
reflection has led to a scientific consensus that they were
greatly overstated.
<P>Such manipulations of perceived risk are very dangerous.
Although this nonscientific behavior is supposedly in defense of
human and environmental health, it obscures the line between
science and policy to the detriment of both. Misuse of science
can lead to either too little regulation or too much; worse yet,
it disregards real differences among chemicals and so leads to
expenditures of large resources to reduce exposures that may have
little health impact while ignoring others that may pose a real
danger.
<P>For example, emphasis on chemical contaminants of questionable
health significance has taken attention away from microbial
contaminants that pose a far more immediate threat, including
bacteria in hamburger meat and parasites in the water supply,
which have killed and continue to cause illness in hundreds of
people across the U.S. every year. Likewise, the authors' warning
of threats to fertility distract from more serious, documented
environmental problems. Furthermore, when "scientific" claims are
later shown to be false, people become less likely to react when
a true threat is uncovered.
<P>Recent indications suggest that the situation is improving. It
appears that the public has become more wary of "scientific"
claims of health hazards of environmental contaminants. New
reports of the dangers of pesticides on fruits and vegetables and
about the risks of cancer from common household products such as
toothpaste aroused only minor public reaction. Indeed, the public
response to <I>Our Stolen Future</I> has been quite subdued.
Parents have not run after their children to retrieve sandwiches
in plastic wrap that is claimed to contain endocrine disrupters,
as they reportedly did to retrieve apples believed to be
contaminated with Alar.
<P>There are also indications that the federal response may be
changing. A draft report from the national Commission on Risk
Assessment and Risk Management proposes that the assumption that
cancer in rats is always indicative of cancer in humans be
scrapped and that data about the mechanism of action of a
chemical be considered in deciding whether the results of rodent
studies are applicable to human risk.
<P>The authors of <I>Our Stolen Future</I> portray their work as
a new <I>Silent Spring-</I>a call to action to protect people and
their environment from an insidious chemical scourge. In fact, it
appears that the book may serve quite a different purpose: it may
stimulate deeper discussion about how to improve the way that
science is used in evaluating environmental risks.

<P>This film buys wholesale into the proposition that the
power of science and technology knows no bounds. A series of
talking heads argue that genetic engineering, machine
intelligence and the like will enable us to fabricate
custom-tailored environments that are completely cut off from
nature. Iara Lee's breezy, fast-cut style keeps the story
entertaining and helps to gloss over the lightweight speculations
offered by some of her subjects (the performance artist Orlan
says she uses cosmetic surgery to achieve a "total change of
identity"). Only at fleeting moments, however, does the film's
thesis seem believable enough to feel truly chilling.

<BR><I>by John Horgan. Addison-Wesley, 1996 ($24).</I>

<P>At the opposite extreme is this book by the senior writer at
<I>Scientific American, </I>which examines the impulse to seek
ultimate answers and ponders whether attaining them will leave
science with nowhere to go. Notwithstanding the title, the book
is as much an exploration of epistemology as it is an exercise in
millennialism: Horgan interviews some of the foremost researchers
(many of whom he has profiled in this magazine) to show how the
growth of knowledge is both driven and limited by the quirky
creativity of the human mind.

<FONT SIZE=+2>WONDERS</FONT>
<BR>by Owen Gingerich
<BR><H2>Neptune, Velikovsky
<BR>and the Name of the Game</H2>
<BR>Then felt I like some watcher of the skies
<BR>When a new planet swims into his ken.
<BR>-<I>On First Looking 
<BR>into Chapman's Homer, </I>John Keats
<P>For young John Couch Adams, a new planet figuratively swam
into view when, as a University of Cambridge undergraduate, he
wrote, "Formed a design of investigating...the irregularities in
the motion of Uranus which are yet unaccounted for; in order to
find out whether they may be attributed to the action of an
undiscovered planet beyond it...."
<P>Uranus had been discovered 62 years earlier, in 1781, by
William Herschel. In 1843, with its period of 84 years, Uranus
had not quite made a complete cycle around the sun since its
detection. But a few "prediscovery" observations had turned up,
whereby astronomers had recorded its position under the
assumption that it was a star. By the early 1800s those positions
obtained before 1781 had become a problem-an orbit that could
represent the "modern" observations simply didn't fit.
<P>Adams was challenged to make sense of all the observations by
postulating an unseen planet whose gravitational influence was
perturbing the path of Uranus. And solve the puzzle he did.
Unfortunately, Adams had more success in resolving the
discrepancies than in persuading the English astronomical
establishment to look for the unknown perturber. He sent his
solution to the Astronomer Royal George Biddell Airy, who
eventually worked out a search plan with his colleague James
Challis at Cambridge. The idea was to map all the stars in a
rather large area around Adams's predicted path and then to remap
them later to see if any had moved.
<P>The same sort of mathematical attack on the recalcitrant
motion of Uranus had been undertaken by Urbain Jean Joseph Le
Verrier of the &#201;cole Polytechnique in Paris. In 1845 D. Fran&#231;ois
Jean Arago, director of the Paris Observatory, had suggested the
problem to him, and by August 1846, Le Verrier had also predicted
a position for the unknown perturber.
<P>Like Adams, Le Verrier apparently had trouble convincing his
countrymen to make a swift and decisive search for his predicted
planet. Consequently, in September 1846 he sent his prediction to
several observers who had large telescopes. J. G. Galle of the
Berlin Observatory had some difficulty securing the permission of
his director to search for the planet. A younger astronomer, H.
L. d'Arrest, overheard the discussion, and here fate played a
serendipitous role: d'Arrest remembered that a relevant new chart
had been drawn up though not yet distributed. With the aid of the
chart, it took only minutes to find the interloping object. It
was within a degree of Le Verrier's prediction and essentially at
the same distance from Adams's.
<P>Within a day, word reached Cambridge, where chagrin was
rampant. Challis searched his logbook and beside one entry wrote,
"This must have been the planet." The situation was especially
poignant because a few nights earlier he had already written,
"Seems to have a disk," which indeed marked the sought-after
quarry.
<P>In the end the honors were shared, although naval Britain won
out with the name "Neptune," after the mythological god of the
sea, as opposed to the more modern appellation "Le Verrier,"
espoused by the French (who were also disposed to rename Uranus
"Herschel").
<P>More significant than assigning priorities is to examine the
almost iconic importance the discovery achieved as a successful
prediction of Newtonian theory. To be sure, skeptics argued that
there were insufficient data for a genuine prediction and that
the whole business was a fantastic coincidence. Later, doubters
pointed to a garbled telegram about a comet discovery,
and-voil&#224;-another comet was found in the location specified by
the erroneous telegram!
<P>Nevertheless, the idea became firmly entrenched that the
hallmark of a satisfactory theory was successful prediction. But
to hold foresight, as opposed to understanding, as the touchstone
of genuine science is to miss half the game: the wonderful
connective fiber that constitutes our contemporary scientific
fabric.
<P>An illuminating example comes in the case of the late Immanuel
Velikovsky, whose 1950 <I>Worlds in Collision</I> created massive
consternation in the scientific community. His book argued that
many miraculous events described in the Bible were literally true
and could be explained by catastrophic events in the solar
system. Velikovsky sent the German translation of his work to his
fellow Princeton resident, Albert Einstein. Einstein, with his
well-known sympathy for proponents of unorthodox ideas, examined
the materials but soon lost patience, making marginal notes such
as "wilde Phantasie" and "Unsinn" ("nonsense"). "It would be
better," Einstein reputedly informed Velikovsky, "if your theory
could predict something."
<P>Velikovsky began to look for predictions his theory had made.
Now, Velikovsky's incredible scenario called for Venus to have
been born out of Jupiter within historical times, which suggested
that Venus should be hot and Jupiter should show signs of its
recent trauma, such as giving off radio noise. At the time, there
was division about the temperature of the Venusian surface. In
1962 the <I>Mariner 2</I> spacecraft found evidence of a high
surface temperature; meanwhile radio astronomers detected radio
static from Jupiter. Velikovsky was elated. Now would not the
scientists take his theory seriously? After all, it had passed
the test of successful predictions.
<P>Yet scientists were no more prepared than before to accept
Velikovsky's proposal after these predictions. Even Einstein
wrote to him, "Katastrophen <I>ja, </I>Venus<I> nein.</I>" The
problem was that Velikovsky's ideas about Venus seemed, within
the larger fabric of science, as preposterous as some of the
creationists' current claims that the strata of the Grand Canyon
were laid down by Noah's flood. The notion that Venus could, at
the time of the Exodus, come so near the earth as to drip manna
from its fiery tail defied all canons of celestial mechanics. It
was the fabric of science, its overall coherence of
understanding, that held the day.
<P>What is important about the discovery of Neptune 150 years ago
this month is not so much that it was a glorious prediction but
rather that it remains a particularly colorful strand in the rich
tapestry of science, the magnificent pattern that holds it all
together. Coherence, the power of the grand explanation, not
isolated proofs and predictions, gives science its strength and
cogency. Understanding is the name of the game.

<FONT SIZE=+2>CONNECTIONS</FONT>
<BR>by <B>James Burke</B>
<H2>Impressions</H2>
<P>Fortunately for me, at a recent reception to mark the opening
of an exhibition, there was a woman drinking a glass of
champagne, and I got the impression she was scrutinizing one of
those paintings you can only truly appreciate from a distance. I
say "fortunately" because the event provided me with the gist of
this column (and several glasses of champagne).
<P>Early in the 19th century, in the middle of a number of
battles against everyone else in Europe, Napoleon must have got
fed up with the fact that the massive levels of industrial output
by the enemy Brits meant that he was fighting them armed with
British-built cannon manned by troops wearing uniforms made in
England! <I>Zut!</I>
<P>So he set up a Society to Encourage French Inventors (very
rough translation), and in 1810 a total nobody called Nicolas
Appert stepped forward to collect the society's prize of 12,000
francs for a crazy idea he'd tried out on the French navy a year
or so earlier. Appert had come up with a scheme for preserving
food. All you had to do was seal the food in a champagne bottle
(Appert was a cook and champagne bottler), then immerse the
bottle in water brought to a boil for long enough to kill the
germs that caused putrefaction. As is so often the case with
these major advances in science and technology, Appert didn't
know that bactericide was what he was actually doing, germs not
having been named yet. But never mind.
<P>Poetic ravings about how M. Appert's bottled veggies "brought
spring and summer to winter" appeared in the French press, so the
Brits heard about it. In 1811 an Anglo-French go-between named
John Gamble, one of the British prisoner-of-war exchange team in
Paris--Gamble was also married to a Frenchwoman--managed to get
hold of Appert's patent. One year later, with partners Bryan
Donkin and John Hall, Gamble set up a business in Bermondsey,
South London, repeating the food-preservation trick, but this
time in tin cans (one of his buddies had experience in iron
making). Well, after the British royal family had sampled some of
the new products and pronounced them delicious, how could the
business fail?
<P>In 1818 canning got another boost when the exploratory captain
John Ross sailed off in a blaze of publicity to find the
Northwest Passage, carrying a large supply of cans of carrots and
gravy, soup, roast veal and peas. In 1829 the intrepid captain's
next, similarly provisioned expedition (funded by Felix Booth,
distiller of the eponymous gin) discovered the North Magnetic
Pole. And Ross named the northernmost tip of North America the
"Boothia" Peninsula. If truth be told, the magnetic discovery was
made by Ross's nephew and co-leader of the expedition, James, who
was so bitten by the polar bug that in 1839 he shot off in the
opposite direction, on the HMS <I>Erebus, </I>to spend four years
finding and mapping large bits of Antarctica, as well as other
spots en route.
<P>On this occasion, one member of his crew was a Joseph Hooker,
who later became famous by writing up the botanical finds from
the trip and then doing the same on assorted sorties to Nepal and
to Sikkim and Assam (now part of India). As a result of these
Himalayan ramblings, Hooker became known to gardeners all over
when he introduced to the West most varieties of rhododendron,
then, patiently, over years, catalogued more than 300 types of
impatiens. For such persistence, in 1865 Hooker was made director
of the British Royal Botanical Gardens at Kew (following his
father in the job) and proceeded to whip the place into the
international center for botanical research it is today. He also
saved many a latter-day tourist (and me) from the rigors of
frequently bone-chilling London afternoons when he commissioned
the tropically warm splendors of Kew's beautiful Palm House.
<P>Speaking of which, Hooker contributed at least two other
things that matter to the 20th century. He helped to organize the
smuggling of rubber tree seedlings out of Brazil (not at all
British) so they could be nurtured and transplanted to the Malay
Archipelago (mostly British at the time), thus laying the
foundations of the entire rubber industry and making possible the
invention of the raincoat (see the June column).
<P>Hooker went on to do the same trick for the African oil palm.
Palm oil really came into its own thanks to Napoleon's nephew
(Napoleon III) and <I>his</I> problems with feeding the troops
(and a rapidly rising population). In response to yet another
imperial call to the flag (and the offer of another fat prize), a
French chemist called Hyppolyte M&#233;ge-Mouri&#233;s changed the nature
of the sandwich with what was, in its final form, a mixture of
animal fat churned with milk and salt, which was then chilled,
kneaded and packaged. But poor old Hyppolyte never got his hands
on the prize money. To add insult to injury, certain others,
recognizing on which side their financial bread was buttered,
promptly took advantage of patent law loopholes to mass-produce
their own versions of his new food substitute (known as
margarine) and to become modern industrial giants (in later years
using palm oil in preference to animal fat).
<P>M&#233;ge-Mouri&#233;s had derived all he knew about fats (and probably
also the name he gave his invention) from the esteemed
Michel-Eug&#233;ne Chevreul. In 1889, when Chevreul died at the age of
103, France declared a day of national mourning, because
Chevreul's research into fats and oils had made the world a
brighter, sweeter place. He'd turned soap making into an exact
science, and he'd invented a better candle.
<P>Chevreul had also improved on French tapestry making. In 1824
he was the director of dyeworks at the great Gobelins factory
(the way organic dyes act on fabric has a lot to do with plant
oils). As part of his work on color (his word "margarine" comes
from the Greek for "pearl colored"), Chevreul produced his "Law
of Simultaneous Contrast," which postulated that the way a color
is seen has to do with whatever colors are placed next to it. So
might the Gobelins weavers have observed with their very first
throw of the shuttle, but, as far as I know, nobody had yet
looked at the matter scientifically.
<P>One final step--and if you recall the way I started this
column, you'll already be ahead of me. Because there was only one
bunch (apart from the weavers) who cared deeply about this
color-juxtaposition thing: Georges Seurat and his painter pals,
bowled over by what you could do with a lot of little dabs of
different color placed in proximity. Which is, I suppose, an
offensively oversimple way to describe what the art world
recognizes as Pointillism. Demonstrated brilliantly in 1886 by
Seurat in his <I>Un Dimanche &#224; la Grande Jatte, </I>one of the
more impressive works of the so-called Neo-Impressionist school
he founded.
<P>Another example of which was being examined by that woman I
mentioned (remember?), who was sipping champagne at the
exhibition reception.
<P>One last little touch. Guess where Seurat's family came from?
Champagne.

CAUSES AND PREVENTION

<CENTER><H2>WHAT CAUSES CANCER?</H2>

<P>The top two causes-
<BR>tobacco and diet-account for 
<BR>almost two thirds of all cancer deaths and 
<BR>are among the most correctable.</CENTER> 

<P><I><A HREF="#author">by Dimitrios Trichopoulos, Frederick P. Li and David J. Hunter</A></I>

<P>Cancer, a major killer throughout human history, changed its
grasp as humankind advanced industrially and technologically.
Although the risk of a few types of cancer has declined
dramatically in developed countries in this century, the
incidence of the most significant forms of the disease has
increased. Cancers of the <A HREF="0996twelvecancers.html#lung">lung</A>, <A HREF="0996twelvecancers.html#breast">breast</A>, <A HREF="0996twelvecancers.html#prostate">prostate</A> and colon and
rectum have all become more frequent in countries where risk
factors such as <A HREF="http://cancer.med.upenn.edu/causeprevent/smoking/">cigarette smoking</A>, unhealthful dietary habits and
exposure to dangerous chemicals at work or in the environment are
now more common.

<P>As industrialization has proliferated, so, too, have the
suspected <A HREF="http://wwwicic.nci.nih.gov/clinpdq/risk.html">causes</A> of cancer. In recent years, news accounts have
been full of warnings about all manner of modern conveniences,
from pharmaceuticals to cellular telephones. Meanwhile the pace
of technological advance makes it more vital than ever to single
out definitive causes of cancer from an ever expanding array of
possibilities.

<P>For this daunting task, researchers rely heavily on
epidemiology. Epidemiologists identify factors that are common to
cancer victims' history and way of life and evaluate them in the
context of current biological understanding. Ultimately, the
evidence may persuade researchers that one or more of these
factors or characteristics "cause" the disease-that is to say,
exposure to them significantly increases the odds of the illness
developing.

<P>Over the past half century, epidemiology has enabled
researchers not only to ferret out many of the <A HREF="http://www.cancer.org/environ.html">environmental
(that is, noninherited) causes</A> of cancer but also to estimate how
many annual cancer deaths can be attributed to each one. Although
the work cannot be used to predict what will happen to any one
individual, it nonetheless provides broadly useful information
for people seeking to minimize their exposure to known
cancer-causing agents, or <A HREF="http://ntp-server.niehs.nih.gov/Main_Pages/NTP_ARC_PG.html">carcinogens</A>.

<P>Cancer seems to arise from the effects of two different kinds
of carcinogens. One of these categories comprises agents that
damage genes involved in controlling cell proliferation and
migration. Cancer arises when a single cell accumulates a number
of these mutations, usually over many years, and finally escapes
from most restraints on proliferation. The mutations allow the
cell and its descendants to develop additional alterations and to
accumulate in increasingly large numbers, forming a tumor that
consists mostly of these abnormal cells. Another category
includes agents that do not damage genes but instead selectively
enhance the growth of tumor cells or their precursors. The
primary danger of malignancies is that they can metastasize,
allowing some of their cells to migrate and thus carry the
disease to other parts of the body. Finally, the illness can
reach and disrupt one of the body's vital organs.

<P>Hardly any researchers doubt that repeatedly exposing parts of
the body to, for example, chemicals in tobacco smoke, may
eventually bring about the cellular damage that can lead to
cancer. But the details of how most exposures give rise to such
damage remain elusive. One long-standing theory holds that many
environmental stressors, as well as aging and other life
processes, play a role by increasing the generation in the body
of so-called free radicals-chemically reactive fragments of
molecules. By reacting with a gene's DNA, these fragments can
damage and permanently mutate the gene. Other cancer-causing
agents, such as some viruses, seem to act differently, by
accelerating the rate of cell division.

<P>Of course, the <A HREF="http://www.gdb.org/Dan/DOE/intro.html">genes people inherit</A> from their parents also
influence cancer development. Some are born with mutations that
directly promote excessive growth of certain cells or the
formation of more mutations. Evolutionary pressure, however,
assures that such mutations are rare; they are responsible for
the development of fewer than 5 percent of fatal cancer cases.  Known
genes linked to inherited human cancers are listed in <A HREF="0996trichtable1.html">Genes and Cancer Risk</A>.

<P>On the other hand, more general inherited physiological
traits, in contrast to mutations in genes that regulate cell
growth, contribute in some way to the vast majority of cancers.
For example, inheriting fair skin makes a person more prone to
skin cancer. But although fair-skinned people are more
susceptible, they develop the disease only after extensive
exposure to sunlight, an environmental carcinogen. Further, if
someone inherits a normal genetic variant that causes the body to
eliminate certain carcinogens relatively inefficiently, that
person, after repeated exposure to the carcinogen, will be more
likely to acquire the cancer than will a person who has a more
efficient form of this gene.

<P>One common question about cancer concerns the number of cases
that would be expected to arise naturally in otherwise healthy,
genetically normal individuals who somehow had managed to avoid
all environmental carcinogens. Only a rough estimate is
available, arrived at by comparing populations with very
different cancer patterns. Perhaps a quarter of all cancers are
"hard core"-in other words, they would develop even in a world
free of external influences, simply because of the production of
carcinogens within the body and the occurrence of unrepaired
genetic mistakes.

<P>Epidemiologists have shown, however, that in most cases, the
environment (including lifestyle factors) plays a profound role.
How strong are these data? The weak link in cancer epidemiology
is the inability to conduct trials in which groups of people,
selected at random, are exposed to potential carcinogens or even
to potential cancer-preventing compounds. Randomized studies of
carcinogens are obviously unacceptable for ethical reasons;
unfortunately, lack of such studies can seriously complicate the
interpretation of the evidence.

<P>Consequently, we can consider epidemiologic studies to have
identified a cause of the disease only when people who have a
given type of cancer are consistently found to have a history of
unusually high exposure to a particular agent. Alternatively, a
link can be declared when a weak relation between an agent and a
form of cancer is consistently reported in a variety of
circumstances and backed by persuasive biological plausibility.

<P>Accordingly, we have based our assessment of the evidence for
what causes cancer either on overwhelming epidemiologic data for
which the precise biological mechanisms remain speculative or on
weak but consistent epidemiologic findings that are also
biologically credible. The <A HREF="http://www.usnews.com/usnews/nycu/tomato.htm">role of vegetables and fruits</A> in
cancer prevention, for example, tends to be in the former
category, whereas the carcinogenic potential of secondhand smoke
fits into the latter: relatively few people are afflicted with
lung cancer after exposure to secondhand smoke alone, but the
connection has been documented consistently and credibly
explained. We have culled the data presented here from hundreds
of studies, and the views we offer are shared by many, if not
most, researchers and health professionals. In keeping with the
standard practice in cancer epidemiology, our focus is on fatal
rather than all cancer cases, to avoid distortions introduced by
common cancers that only rarely become lethal. All the results we
discuss apply to the U.S. and to other industrial nations unless
we indicate otherwise. The data for developed countries do not
necessarily apply to developing countries, in which
cancer-causing infections and, increasingly, some occupational
carcinogens tend to be more prevalent.

<P><B><A HREF="http://www.cancer.org/tobacco.html" NAME="1">Tobacco Smoke</A> Is Top Carcinogen</B>

<P>More than half the cancer deaths in the U.S.-perhaps even 60
percent-can be attributed to tobacco smoke and diet. Smoking
causes 30 percent of cancer deaths, making tobacco smoke the
single most lethal carcinogen in the U.S. Apart from smoking and
diet, other environmental factors each contribute to only a few
percent of total deaths.

<P>Smoking, mainly of cigarettes, causes cancer of the lung,
upper respiratory tract, esophagus, bladder and pancreas and
probably of the stomach, liver and kidney. Smoking is implicated
in chronic myelocytic leukemia and may also cause cancer of the
colon and rectum and other organs. Whether smoking will result in
malignancy depends on several factors, including the frequency of
smoking, the cigarettes' tar content and-most important-the
duration of the habit. Taking up the habit while very young
substantially amplifies the risk. The risks vary from one type of
cancer to another; thus, on average, smokers are twice as likely
to be afflicted with cancer of the bladder but eight times more
likely to contract cancer of the lung.

<P><A HREF="http://www.idiom.com/%7Ebilofsky/smoking.htm">Passive smoking</A>, or inhalation of tobacco smoke in the
environment, causes much less lung cancer than active smoking
does. Nevertheless, a few thousand people die every year in the
U.S. from cancers attributable mainly to secondhand smoke. Thus,
passive smoking is as much a killer as general outdoor air
pollution or household exposure to the radioactive gas radon
(which is emitted naturally from the earth in some areas).

<B><A NAME="2">Eat Right, Live Longer</A></B>

<P>Only <A HREF="http://cancer.med.upenn.edu/causeprevent/diet/">diet</A> rivals tobacco smoke as a cause of cancer in the
U.S., accounting for a comparable number of fatalities each year.
Animal (saturated) fat in general and <A HREF="http://cnn.com/US/9604/30/meat.cancer/index.html">red meat</A> in particular are
associated with several cancers; both are strongly linked to
malignancies of the colon and rectum; <A HREF="http://cancer.med.upenn.edu/cancer_news/prost_fat.html">saturated fats have been
implicated in prostate cancer</A> as well.

<P>A few issues concerning dietary fat still puzzle researchers.
Investigations with animals have indicated that under specific
conditions certain types of polyunsaturated fat increase the risk
for cancer at some bodily sites, but we have little supportive
human evidence. Also, rigorous epidemiologic studies have not
supported some of the early and still popular hypotheses
concerning dietary fat and cancer. For example, high intake of
fats (typically, animal fat) in adults has not been shown to
increase risk for breast cancer in most investigations that have
followed large groups of women for up to a dozen years.

<P>Among nonnutrient food additives, only salt appears to be a
significant contributor to cancer. Studies of populations outside
the U.S. suggest that high intake can lead to stomach cancer.
Also, in Southeast Asia, very young children who eat a great deal
of salty fish tend to have excessive rates of cancer of the
nasopharynx (the upper part of the pharynx, which reaches the
nasal passages). Similarly, drinking beverages while they are
very hot, including mat&#233;, a South American tea-like drink, has
been shown to increase the risk of esophageal cancer.

<P>In contrast, most investigations of coffee (with or without
<A HREF="http://www.social.com/health/ific/food_additives/ir-caffh.html">caffeine</A>) have not linked it to human cancer. Moreover, it does
not seem to matter how the beverage is sweetened: there is ample
evidence that <A HREF="http://cancer.med.upenn.edu/pdq_html/6/engl/600319.html\">artificial sweeteners</A>, in reasonable quantities, do
not cause cancer.

<P>The <A HREF="http://206.135.37.254/library/articles/quillin/link.htm">links between diet and cancer</A>, however, may have as much
to do with what is <I>not </I>in a diet as with what is. Skimping
on vegetables and fruits can be a significant contributor to many
different kinds of cancer, for reasons that are not fully known.
The protective effects of these foods may derive from specific
constituents that block the carcinogenic activities of substances
made in our own bodies. For instance, <A HREF="http://www.smu.edu/%7Ebtavares/antioxidants/">antioxidants</A> in foods are
believed to neutralize free radicals. Other chemicals in
healthful foods, it has been suggested, block the signals that
such steroids as estrogen send-signals that cause cells in the
breast and elsewhere to proliferate. Yet foods contain thousands
of chemicals, and investigators remain unsure of which ones, and
which combinations, are most potent as cancer blockers.

<P>Diet can exert its effects not only through the type of
calories consumed but also through their quantity. Researchers
believe that taking in more energy than is expended can be
harmful throughout life, probably through different mechanisms at
different ages. Children who overeat and exercise too little
often grow more and seem to be at a higher risk of acquiring
certain cancers.

<P>These findings have been most striking for breast cancer.
Excessive childhood growth, as reflected in attained height and
weight, seems to push girls into menstruating when they are
relatively young, and early menstruation is a major risk factor
for <A HREF="0996breast.html">breast cancer</A> (it may contribute to other cancers as well).
Such early-life factors as excessive growth caused by overeating
and insufficient exercise could be a component cause in perhaps 5
percent of cancers of the breast and prostate, which become fatal
relatively frequently.

<P>Obesity in adult life is an important cause of cancer of the
endometrium (the lining of the uterus) and an established but
relatively weak cause of postmenopausal breast cancer. For
unknown reasons, obesity also appears to increase the risk for
cancers of the colon, kidney and gallbladder.

<P>Consumption of large quantities of alcoholic beverages,
particularly by smokers, increases the risk of cancer of the
upper respiratory and digestive tracts, and alcoholic cirrhosis
frequently leads to liver cancer. Although modest drinking does
seem to reduce the risk of heart disease, converging data suggest
that intake of as few as one or two drinks a day may contribute
to breast and perhaps colon and rectal cancer.

<P>Alcoholic beverages have been estimated to contribute to about
3 percent (beyond the 30 percent attributed to diet) of total
cancer mortality in the developed world. A sedentary way of life
contributes to an additional 3 percent. And food additives,
mainly salt, may contribute to another 1 percent.

<P><B><A NAME="3">Radiation and You</A></B>

<P>Unlike smoking and the dietary practices we have discussed,
many other threats, albeit less consequential ones, are rather
difficult to avoid. Various forms of radiation-from the sun,
electric power lines, household appliances, <A HREF="http://cancer.med.upenn.edu/pdq_html/6/engl/600323.html">cellular telephones</A>
and naturally occurring, radioactive <A HREF="http://cancer.med.upenn.edu/pdq_html/6/engl/600352.html">radon gas</A>-are the most
highly publicized of the threats that have been proposed.
Radiation causes perhaps 2 percent of all cancer deaths. Most of
these fatalities result from natural sources of radiation-the
majority can be attributed to melanoma skin cancer triggered by
the sun's ultraviolet rays.

<P>Within the ultraviolet spectrum that reaches the earth's
surface, the most troubling component consists of the
higher-frequency ultraviolet B rays, which can damage DNA.
Ultraviolet B rays alone cause more than 90 percent of skin
cancers, including melanomas, which are much more frequently
fatal than all other forms of skin cancer [see "<A HREF="0796leffell.html">Sunlight and Skin
Cancer</A>," by David J. Leffell and Douglas E. Brash; Scientific
American, July]. Many researchers now believe that the frequency
of sunburns during childhood, rather than the cumulative exposure
to sunlight, is the key factor in bringing about melanoma. People
who tan but do not burn, therefore, are at much less risk.

<P>Another natural source of radiation is radon, a colorless,
odorless and radioactive gas that is emitted from the earth in
some regions. It can seep into buildings and collect in
ground-floor or basement areas. Prolonged breathing of the gas at
very high levels, found mostly in underground mines, has been
tied to increased incidence of lung cancer. This is not a
significant cause of cancer in the general population, however,
and radon levels are usually lowered by improving the ventilation
of a building or mine.

<P>The electric and magnetic fields generated by power lines and
electric household appliances, which oscillate at 60 cycles per
second in the U.S., are known as extremely low frequency fields.
They have been intensively <A HREF="http://www.lbl.gov/LBL-Science-Articles/Archive/electromagnetic-radiation-study.html">studied</A> for possible cancer-causing
effects. So far the collective evidence is confusing, selectively
propagated and generally incorrectly perceived. Too often these
accounts sow fear by discounting basic science. A cancer-causing
genetic mutation cannot be induced by radiation, as far as anyone
can discern, unless molecules in the body become charged by
gaining or losing one or more electrons-in other words, unless
they become ionized. And the photons associated with extremely
low frequency fields would have to be a million times more
energetic before they could ionize molecules.

<P>Epidemiologic studies have indicated, however, that these
fields may somehow increase to a marginal degree the risk of
childhood leukemia; the evidence for other cancers is
considerably weaker. It is not possible to discount completely
the possibility that power lines contribute to some forms of
cancer, but the evidence, in our view, is scant. Even for
childhood leukemia, the collective evidence is so thin that it
can be interpreted either way-as showing a genuine link with the
disease or merely as reflecting flaws in the epidemiologic data.

<P>The fear of extremely low frequency fields seems to have
several underlying causes. One is the incorrect association made
between such fields and other forms of radiation. Another is the
wide publicity that has been given to relatively small and
preliminary studies.

<P>Radio-frequency electromagnetic radiation, which is emitted by
cellular telephones, microwave and other wireless systems and
even living creatures, is quite distinct from extremely low
frequency fields. Even at the much higher radio frequencies,
though, photon energy is still several orders of magnitude below
the level required to ionize a molecule. In urban settings, where
radio-frequency fields are strongest, ambient energy levels are
less than one one-hundredth of those emitted by a human being.
Investigators are currently studying the radio emanations
associated with cellular telephones for a possible link to brain
cancer, but so far no empirical evidence supports such a
connection. (The only major study so far did not establish a
connection.)

<P>On the other hand, the radiation that comes from nuclear
materials and reactions is sufficiently energetic to ionize
molecules and is unquestionably carcinogenic. But, again, the
general public tends to overestimate the risk posed by low levels
of radiation. Among Japanese residents of Hiroshima and Nagasaki
who survived longer than approximately one year after the atomic
bomb blasts-and who were exposed to radiation levels far higher
than most people will ever encounter-only 1 percent have died
from cancers known to be related to radiation. Epidemiologic
studies have failed to validate claims that the incidence of
leukemia is higher among those living near nuclear plants and
among children of nuclear reactor workers.

<P><B><A NAME="4">Of Work, Medications and Microbes</A></B>

<P>A number of substances now known to be carcinogenic, including
asbestos, benzene, formaldehyde, diesel exhaust and radon, were
initially revealed to be dangerous in unfortunate "natural
experiments" involving exposures to very high concentrations in
the workplace. In recent years,
however, the control of such occupational carcinogens, at least
in the developed world, has brought about a little known success
story in public health.

<P>Strict control measures in the workplace over the past 50
years have shrunk the proportion of fatal cancer cases caused by
occupational exposures to perhaps less than 5 percent. Before
1950 the proportion may have been twice as great. Unfortunately,
though, occupation-associated cancers, which occur mostly in the
lung, skin, bladder and the blood-forming (hematopoietic) system,
are likely to increase in developing countries as they rapidly
industrialize.

<P>Medical treatment, like workplace exposure, has generated
unintended insights into cancer causation, as some procedures or
medications have turned out to have carcinogenic effects. Ironic
as it may seem, medical products and procedures may be
responsible for about 1 percent of all cancers. Still, their
overall clinical usefulness far outweighs the risks. This is true
of many cancer therapies, including radiation and chemotherapy.
Some effective drugs or combinations of such drugs used to treat
cancers such as Hodgkin's disease can cause acute leukemia in
about 5 percent of survivors and, in rare cases, bladder cancer.

<P>Immunosuppressive drugs can also be carcinogenic, causing
certain types of lymphomas; supplemental estrogens taken to
offset menopausal symptoms have been linked to endometrial and
breast cancer. And steroids used for treatment of aplastic anemia
have been associated with rare cases of liver cancer.

<P>Early reports indicated that tamoxifen, an experimental breast
cancer drug, could occasionally cause endometrial cancer,
although recent studies are more equivocal. Fertility drugs that
mimic the effects of gonadotropins, including Pergonal, are
suspected of increasing the risk of ovarian cancer. Growth
hormones administered to children might elevate their risk of
leukemia. Some diuretics could increase the risk of kidney
cancer, and some cholesterol-lowering drugs may heighten the risk
of colon and rectal cancer, but for these, too, the evidence is
very tenuous.

<P><A HREF="http://cancer.med.upenn.edu/pdq_html/6/engl/600313.html">Oral contraceptives</A> slightly increase the risk of some types
of liver tumors and, under certain conditions, of pre-menopausal
breast cancer. Yet birth-control pills also reduce the risk of
ovarian and endometrial cancer and perhaps that of colon and
rectal cancer as well.

<P>Viruses and other infectious agents, overlooked as causes of
cancer only 30 years ago, may contribute to about 5 percent of
all fatal cases in developed countries.

<P><B><A NAME="5">Pollution's Share</A></B>

<P>Environmental pollution in the air, water and soil plays an
infrequent and difficult-to-document role in human cancer.
Harmful effects are hard to verify because they generally result
from exposure to several carcinogens at very low levels.
Nevertheless, it is reasonable to assume that pollutants could
contribute to about 2 percent of fatal cancers, mainly of the
lung and bladder.

<P><A HREF="http://www.lbl.gov/LBL-Science-Articles/Archive/ecological-hazard-evaluation.html">Ecological studies</A>, which are similar to epidemiologic ones
but with less specificity and detail, indicate that lung cancer
rates in polluted cities exceed those in rural areas. And, in
fact, data do suggest that urban smokers are more likely to
develop lung cancer than rural smokers-even after accounting for
smoking behavior (how heavily a person smokes, what kind of
cigarettes are smoked and so on). Yet urban nonsmokers do not
appear to be at increased risk for lung cancer.

<P>Taken together, such studies, emission inventories and
chemical analyses of air samples from urban areas suggest that
long-term exposure to high levels of air pollution could increase
lung cancer risk by about 50 percent, especially among smokers.
(Although this figure may seem like a great increase in risk,
heavy smoking, by itself, increases risk by about 2,000 percent.)
Diesel exhaust, which is probably more carcinogenic than
nondiesel exhaust, has been proposed as a likely carcinogenic
factor.

<P>Some researchers maintain that organic compounds whose
molecules contain chlorine and ring-shaped components increase
the risk of breast cancer and, perhaps, other malignancies
related to the female hormone estrogen. Among these compounds are
ones produced when certain <A HREF="http://oncolink.upenn.edu/pdq_html/6/engl/600312.html">pesticides</A>, such as <A HREF="http://oncolink.upenn.edu/pdq_html/6/engl/600335.html">DDT</A>, have been
altered in the body. The underlying hypothesis is that these
substances, called xenoestrogens, mimic the body's own
(endogenous) estrogens and thus stimulate cell division in the
breast and other reproductive organs. The empirical evidence in
humans is scant, however, and the estrogenic potency of
xeno-estrogens is much weaker than that of endogenous estrogens.

<P>Proximity to hazardous-waste sites or contaminated wells may
have health effects, but it has not been shown to impart a
measurable excess risk for cancer. It is not certain whether the
lack of association is genuine or a reflection of the limited
capacity of statistical methods to document a very weak
correlation.

<P>A few studies have suggested-without convincingly
demonstrating-a tenuous positive association between water
chlorination and cancer of the bladder. All over the world, but
especially in developed countries, chlorination is used to kill
germs in drinking water. Even if chlorination did present an
extremely small cancer risk-which is by no means certain-the
danger would be more than outweighed by chlorine's capacity to
prevent the spread of such waterborne diseases as cholera,
dysentery and typhoid fever. Investigations of water fluoridation
have been reassuring.

<P><B><A NAME="6">Reproductive and Gynecologic Factors</A></B>

<P>Among the body's natural processes, those related to
reproduction are most closely linked, epidemiologically, to
cancer. For women, early age at menarche, late age at first
pregnancy and late age at menopause tend to increase the risk for
breast cancer; the more offspring a woman has had, the less
likely she is to develop cancer of the endometrium, ovary or
breast.

<P>Physiological rationales for these observations are elusive,
for the most part. No one knows exactly why, for example, early
menarche and late menopause are associated with breast cancer.
Both may simply extend the period in a woman's life when she is
exposed to her own sex hormones, especially estrogen.

<P>The protective effects of having children early in life, on
the other hand, may accrue by causing breast cells to become more
differentiated. Differentiation restricts the ability of a cell
to grow abnormally, change its type and survive in other types of
tissue. A first pregnancy at a young age may differentiate breast
cells early in life, after which they would be much less
susceptible to carcinogens.

<P>In developed countries, reproductive behavior is determined
mainly by social and economic forces. Thus, for educational,
career-related and other reasons, millions of women in these
countries are putting off childbearing and are also having fewer
children, in general, than their mothers and grandmothers did.
Unfortunately, such life decisions will lead to higher rates of
breast and ovarian cancer. The postponing of first pregnancies by
younger women in the U.S. that has already occurred will increase
their breast cancer rates by about 5 to 10 percent within the
next 25 years.

<P>Induced abortions have been associated in some studies with a
slight increase in breast cancer risk, but the data are not
conclusive. Several other associations between cancers of the
reproductive tract and certain conditions or behaviors have been
noted, but they, too, are not conclusive, are of marginal
importance or are thought to be surrogates for actual causes. For
example, having multiple sexual partners was once believed to
increase a woman's risk of acquiring cancer of the cervix.
Instead the increased risk probably reflects greater exposure to
sexually transmitted, and potentially carcinogenic, human
viruses.

<P>Taking all these considerations into account, we might
attribute around 4 percent of cancer deaths to
reproduction-related factors.

<P><B><A NAME="7">Socioeconomic Differences</A></B>

<P>Differences in cancer rates among socioeconomic groups can
usually be attributed to differences in lifestyle.
Underprivileged people have higher rates of cancers of the mouth,
stomach, lung, cervix and liver and of a type of esophageal
cancer (squamous cell cancer). Poverty may be thought of as the
underlying cause, because it is almost universally associated
with higher rates of tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption, poor
nutrition and exposure to certain infectious agents-which,
together, can explain most of the cancer-risk propensities listed
above.

<P>In contrast, for reasons that remain largely unknown, cancers
of the breast, prostate and some other sites are more common
among higher socioeconomic groups. Some scientists have
speculated that excessive growth in early life, presumably
because of reduced physical activity and abundant nourishment,
may in some way increase the risk of these cancers. But this
hypothesis has not been evaluated rigorously.

<P>Most of the differences in cancer incidence between races,
too, can be attributed to socioeconomic factors. Some of the
differences between races might have a genetic basis, but genetic
variability is higher within than between races. In general, most
differences among blacks, whites and Asians can be traced to
diet, way of life and environmental exposure. For example,
<A HREF="http://www.cdc.gov/nceh/i%3a/cehweb/nceh/pubcatns/1994/cdc/brosures/breastca.htm#case">Japanese women</A> in Japan have 25 percent of the risk for breast
cancer that white women in the U.S. have. Yet third-generation
Japanese-American women contract breast cancer almost as
frequently as other American women do.

<P><B><A NAME="8">Elusive Mechanisms</A></B>

<P>Although many of the specific physiological and genetic
mechanisms by which environmental carcinogens cause cancer remain
elusive, scientists now have a good sense of the extent to which
various categories of agents contribute to lethal cancers. By and
large, in industrial nations tobacco consumption and dietary
habits are the dominant cancer-causing behaviors. In developing
nations, cancer cases stemming from infectious agents are more
common. But the rapid worldwide spread of the tobacco habit
promises to push smoking to the forefront of causes of cancer
deaths in these regions, too.

<P>Useful though they are for establishing preventive guidelines
and setting health policy objectives, epidemiologic data on the
relative significance of environmental carcinogens cannot predict
the fate of any given individual. A heavy smoker might avoid lung
cancer, a long-term carrier of hepatitis B virus may remain free
from liver cancer, and many healthy elderly people have lived
long lives on terrible diets. For many of the other factors
considered in this article, such as ionizing radiation or some
occupational factors, only extreme exposures (or carrying mutant
genes) put an individual at substantial risk. This is because
multiple, interacting factors are almost always necessary for
cancer to develop.

<P>At present, we have a very limited understanding of how these
interactions allow potential carcinogens to cause cancer. But in
time, research may reveal this crucial link, giving us a more
complete picture of what cancer is-and how it can be stopped.

CURRENT CONTROVERSY
<CENTER><H2>SHOULD WOMEN <BR>IN THEIR 40s <BR>HAVE MAMMOGRAMS?</H2></CENTER>
For at least four years now, breast <A HREF="http://www.nauticom.net/www/onsmain/">cancer specialists</A> have
been heatedly arguing among themselves about whether women in
their forties benefit from having routine mammograms. In 1993
the <A HREF="http://www.nci.nih.gov">National Cancer Institute</A> sparked the debate by proclaiming
that women in this age group need not undergo such screening-a
reversal of the NCI's previous position and the opposite of the
<A HREF="http://www.cancer.org/">American Cancer Society</A> and of the <A HREF="http://www.ama-assn.org">American Medical Association
recommendations</A>.
<P><A HREF="http://www.pslgroup.com/BREASTCANCER.HTM">Physicians</A>, radiologists, statisticians and public health
officials have made claims and counterclaims and-with sometimes
startling emotion-have accused one another of <A HREF="http://www.radonc.uchicago.edu/IWDM/IWDMa82.html">misreading</A> or
misrepresenting data, of performing faulty analyses and of
perpetuating <A HREF="http://www.feminist.org/other/bc/bcmyths.html">myths</A> that have dire consequences for women. Some
specialists, as well as <A HREF="http://www.pmedia.com/Avon/avon.html">cancer societies</A>, <A HREF="http://www.natlbcc.org">women's health
advocates</A> and manufacturers of mammography machines, have argued
that mass screening saves lives; others on the clinical front
lines and in policy-setting roles have contended that evidence
from a number of randomized controlled trials does not support
such a claim. Instead, they say, the data reveal that younger
women whose breasts are scanned by x-rays die at the same <A HREF="http://www.feminist.org/other/bc/bcfact.html">rate</A> as
those whose breasts are <A HREF="http://www.net-advisor.com/mammog/hints.htm">manually examined</A> by a physician on a
regular basis.
<P>Maybe the only true consensus to have emerged (at least among
epidemiologists) from the protracted and politicized dispute is
that it is not possible, given the current data, to prove beyond
a statistical shadow of a doubt that mammography lowers the
breast cancer death rate in women ages 40 to 49, although there
are some who would challenge even this assertion. Given the
disagreement, what's a woman to do?
<P>For now, it appears that there are no unequivocal answers.
Perhaps a woman's best bet is to educate herself about <A HREF="http://mystic.biomed.mcgill.ca/MedinfHome/MedInf-CAE/Desaulniers/MD_MAM1.HTML">what
mammography can and cannot do</A> and then, with the aid of her
physician, decide for herself what course to follow.
<P>One key point to consider is that<B> </B>mammography, though
apparently posing little (if any) risk of causing cancer, is not
foolproof. By some estimates, 10 to 15 percent of women in any
age group who walk away from a mammogram assured that they are
free of cancer go on to acquire it within a year. In some cases,
the disease stems from rapidly growing malignancies that emerged
after screening; in others, from tumors that just failed to show
up on the film. In addition, false negatives may result from a
radiologist's lack of <A HREF="http://sunsite.unc.edu/jksmith/UNC-Radiology-Webserver/Mammography.html">skill</A> or experience, from too few readers
(studies have shown that more cancers are caught by two
independent readers than by a solo reader), from use of older
equipment and because women in their forties often have dense
breasts, which are harder to read clearly.
<P>Mammography also results in a substantial number of false
positive readings, and anyone undergoing the exam should brace
herself for the possibility that her mammogram will fall among
the 5 to 10 percent considered suspicious enough to warrant
further investigation. And of these, the majority (between 60
and 93 percent) turn out to be associated with benign conditions.
<P>But reaching a final determination may also require one or
more <A HREF="http://www.wp.com/bicbs/gdiag.html#bx">biopsies</A> under local or general anesthesia. Aside from the
expense and time it takes, this process can also be physically
taxing and anxiety-provoking. If the positive reading produces a
diagnosis of <A HREF="http://www.wp.com/bicbs/gunder.html#cis">ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)</A>-and some 15 to 20
percent of "cancers" discovered by mammography fall into this
category-the woman faces yet another decision for which medical
science can offer only marginal assistance.
<P>DCIS, which was virtually unknown before the development of
mammography, does not proceed inevitably to invasive cancer. But
with no way of telling when or whether the abnormal cells will
escape from the constraining ducts and flare into deadly disease,
most physicians recommend excising the affected area or, in
some cases, the whole breast.
<P>Yet even if a mammogram reveals an invasive malignancy that is
still so small it cannot be felt, no one has been able to
demonstrate indisputably that early detection reduces mortality.
Which puts us back in the thick of the <A HREF="http://nysernet.org/bcic/acs2/pro.ed/proc.wkshp.young.women/conf.summary.html">debate</A>.
<P><A HREF="http://nysernet.org/bcic/acs2/pro.ed/proc.wkshp.young.women/bc.detect.mamo.detrimental.html">Daniel B. Kopans</A> of Massachusetts General Hospital insists
that faulty interpretations have muddied the picture and that
when eight major studies of mammography are correctly analyzed,
they show a clear benefit in terms of mortality reduction. Kopans
has also written, in the volume <I>Important Advances in Oncology
1995 </I>(J. B. Lippincott), that "screening for breast cancer is
not, primarily, a public health issue, but a question for the
woman who is interested in reducing her risk of dying from breast
cancer."
<P>Taking the opposite view, <A HREF="http://nysernet.org/bcic/acs2/pro.ed/proc.wkshp.early.detect/bse-bpe.html">Cornelia J. Baines</A> of the University
of Toronto has made the case that catching cancers early, often
before they can be felt, does not reduce the overall toll of the
disease. Women trying to decide whether to undergo mammography,
Baines wrote in the same volume, face an "uncomfortable choice.
Will they choose to know they have breast cancer for the last 10
years of their life and to have a small tumor treated? Or will
they choose to know they have breast cancer for the last five
years of their life and to have a larger tumor treated?"
<P>Despite reluctance to support broad-based screening programs,
most experts in the field agree that women at high risk should
receive regular mammograms. A strong factor raising a woman's
risk is having a mother or sisters with breast cancer. Weaker
factors include commencing menstruation before 12 years old;
being childless or bearing one's first child after turning 30; or
being obese.
<P>Given that a woman's likelihood of acquiring breast cancer in
her forties is less than 2 percent and that her chance of dying
from it within a decade is even smaller, most women in this age
group are unlikely to have to confront the disease. For those who
do fall prey, the disquieting word from some specialists is that
medicine can offer slim solace to those with the most aggressive
form of the disease.

CURRENT CONTROVERSY

<CENTER>
<H2>DOES SCREENING 
<BR>FOR PROSTATE CANCER 
<BR>MAKE SENSE?</H2>
</CENTER>

Since 1990 the reported number of new cases of prostate cancer
has tripled, from fewer than 100,000 annually to an estimated
317,100 this year. The jump in incidence is largely the result of
the <A HREF="http://www.oncolink.upenn.edu/cancer_news/fda_psa_2.html">introduction of tests</A>, beginning in the late 1980s, that can
signal the presence of previously undetectable cancer. By
measuring the amount of a protein called <A HREF="http://www.comed.com/Prostate/PSA.html#PSA">prostate-specific
antigen (PSA)</A> in a male adult's blood, the tests may unmask a
cancerous prostate five years or more before other symptoms
arise.

<P>On its face, extending PSA testing to all men seems an
obviously desirable goal. As a rule, the earlier someone's cancer
is <A HREF="http://www.roxane.com/Roxane/RPI/Newsletters/MDA/v10n3.html">detected</A>, the better the person's prospects for cure. And this
cancer now takes a high toll: more than 40,000 men will die of it
in 1996, making it the second leading cause of cancer death
(after lung cancer) and the sixth leading cause of death overall
among American men. Prostate cancer is often characterized as a
disease that older men die <I>with </I>rather than <I>of
</I>(because it often progresses more slowly than other cancers
do). Its incidence, mortality rate and mean age at diagnosis are
in fact very similar to <A HREF="http://www.vyne.com/prototype/0996issue/0996breast.html">breast cancer</A> statistics. Furthermore,
once prostate cancer reaches an advanced stage, there is no
effective therapy.

<P>Yet many physicians, policymakers and patients are questioning
the wisdom of widespread PSA screening. In addition to the
billions of dollars required for universal screening and
subsequent potential treatment, they are deterred by the fact
that no one actually knows whether such testing would benefit the
average man or reduce overall mortality for the population as a
whole.

<P>The favorable arguments are many. PSA is an <A HREF="http://www.comed.com/Prostate/partin/introduction.html">effective
screening tool</A>: biopsies reveal cancer in about a third of men
with elevated PSA levels. Screening clearly detects many tumors
that would be missed by the traditional <A HREF="http://www.comed.com/Prostate/PSA.html#DRE">rectal examination</A>, in
which a physician feels the prostate. In addition, cancers
detected by PSA screening are almost always larger and more
aggressive than the indolent tumors found incidentally at autopsy
in men who die of other causes.

<P>PSA testing also often detects cancer at an early stage, when
it is most likely to respond to treatment. Before PSA testing was
introduced, two thirds of prostate cancers found had already
spread beyond the prostate, making them essentially incurable.
Most patients faced a choice between <A HREF="http://www.comed.com/Prostate/TreatmentOverview.html#HormoneTherapy">hormone therapy</A> and removal
of the testes, neither of which conferred more than a few years
of survival. Today nearly two thirds of prostate cancers detected
in screening programs and treated surgically are confined to the
gland and can thus be eradicated by <A HREF="http://www.capcure.org/patient.htm">surgery</A> or <A HREF="http://www.comed.com/Prostate/TreatmentOverview.html#RadioTherapy">radiation</A>.

<P>For such reasons, both the <A HREF="http://www.cancer.org">American Cancer Society</A> and the
American Urological Association currently <A HREF="http://rattler.cameron.edu:80/ww/">recommend</A> that healthy
men older than 50 years who have a life expectancy of at least 10
years undergo both rectal examination and PSA testing annually.
<A HREF="http://www.oncolink.upenn.edu/pdq_html/6/engl/600624.html">Men at high risk</A> for prostate cancer, including African-Americans
(whose diet and average health care status appear to predispose
them to the disease) and those with a family history of the
disease, should begin testing at age 40.

<P>At the same time, there is no unequivocal evidence that early
detection through periodic screening with PSA measurements (or
rectal examinations, for that matter) in fact reduces the chances
of death from prostate cancer.

<P>Some critics point to mortality figures as evidence that PSA
testing does not save lives. They note that the enormous rise in
early detection through PSA has not yielded a substantial change
in death rates during the past decade. But this argument does not
hold water. Because prostate cancer often progresses more slowly
than other cancers, <A HREF="http://pathfinder.com/@@NnoVAwYAQPtcAL2%2A/time/magazine/domestic/1996/960129/medicine.html">taking 10 years or more to become deadly</A>,
decreases in death rates would not be expected to show up for
many years. If PSA screening does influence mortality, the effect
probably will not be noticeable until after the turn of the
century.

<P>Other concerns about the value of PSA screening arise from the
perhaps surprising fact that most growths of cancerous cells
within the prostate do not lead to serious illness or death. A
third of men over age 50 harbor some form of the cancer, but only
between 6 and 10 percent will acquire the type likely to lead to
death or disability. And only about 3 percent eventually die of
it.

<P>Most prostate tumors are tiny and consist of
well-differentiated or moderately differentiated cells; they are
unlikely to cause clinical disease within the remaining life
expectancy of a man older than 70 years. A small proportion are
large and contain highly irregular cells that metastasize early,
killing patients within a few years of their spread to other
parts of the body. Unfortunately for simple medical decision
making, most malignancies detected today, especially by means of
PSA tests, fall into an intermediate range whose variable natural
history makes it <A HREF="http://www.oncolink.upenn.edu/disease/prostate/stamey.html">difficult to distinguish</A> those likely to
progress rapidly from those that can safely be left alone.

<P>Computer models of the value of early detection and treatment
suggest that screening millions of men may offer little overall
benefit to society in terms of either improved health or
allocation of scarce medical resources. Critics worry about
unnecessary costs and distress to patients. The two thirds of men
who undergo <A HREF="http://cancerguide.org/pathology.html">biopsy</A> as a result of elevated PSA only to learn that
they have no apparent cancer are exposed to unwarranted stress
and anxiety as well as some risk of infection and bleeding. To
these negatives must be added the hazards of treatment (which can
include <A HREF="http://www.comed.com/Prostate/Central/">urinary incontinence and impotence</A>) for a further
minority whose cancer would otherwise have remained undetected
for the rest of their lives. The widespread use of PSA testing to
screen men with no symptoms of prostate cancer, then, could mean
that many tumors that would previously have had no effect on
people's lives will now be detected and treated at substantial
costs in dollars and in suffering. Only time will tell whether
the count of significant yet treatable cancers uncovered-and the
resulting survival benefits-outweighs these costs.

<P>Assuming that a prostate cancer, once detected, is both
dangerous and still potentially curable, there remains
considerable controversy about how to treat it. The three best
understood alternatives are "watchful waiting," external
irradiation and surgical prostatectomy. The choice of treatment
for any given case is a divisive issue for both physician and
patient. Each has its pros and cons, and there is no consensus on
which is best.

<P><A HREF="http://prostate.urol.jhu.edu/surgery/surg.html">Radical prostatectomy</A> has been used to treat prostate cancer
since 1903. Since 1984 the number of operations performed each
year has increased more than sixfold, with an estimated 160,000
done in 1995. Its major advantage is that if the disease is truly
localized, cancerous cells can be removed completely, effectively
curing the patient in as many as 70 percent of cases. More than
four out of five patients who have no detectable PSA five years
after surgery never show signs of recurrence.

<P>The immediate price a patient pays for this effectiveness is a
major operation with a stay in the hospital and an extended
recovery. Longer-term side effects may include several months of
urinary stress incontinence (with a chance of permanent
incontinence between 3 and 5 percent) and six months to a year of
erectile impotence (with a chance of permanent loss between 30
and 50 percent). The rate at which function returns (if it does)
depends on the patient's age, previous state of sexual function
and the extent of the operation to remove the cancer. Medical
centers that have extensive experience with prostate surgery also
tend to produce better results.

<P><A HREF="http://www.comed.com/Prostate/TreatmentOverview.html#RadioTherapy">External irradiation</A> can eliminate the cancer for the
remaining life of the patient while avoiding some of the
immediate postoperative side effects. It has its own risks,
including diarrhea from radiation-induced inflammation of the
rectum in the short term and chronic radiation injury to the
rectum and gradual decline of sexual function over the long term.
Newer conformal radiation therapy employs carefully shaped beams
to maximize the destruction of cancer cells while limiting damage
to surrounding tissue. The technique reduces the risk of bowel
damage to about one in 100 and that of impotence to about one in
three. <A HREF="http://www.nci.nih.gov">The National Cancer Institute's</A> consensus conference on
prostate cancer, held in 1987, concluded that the survival rates
for surgery and for radiation were indistinguishable at both five
and 10 years after treatment.

<P><A HREF="http://www.comed.com/Prostate/TreatmentOverview.html#WatchfulWaiting">Watchful waiting</A>, the most conservative option, avoids
treatment-related risks, but it subjects a man to constant
anxiety about progression of his cancer and the possibility of a
protracted, painful death. Such conservative treatment does not
imply postponing therapy but rather a deliberate decision to
forgo attempts to cure the cancer in the belief that a patient
may well die of old age or some other cause before the malignancy
leads to debility or death. Such patients should expect to need
palliative treatment, including hormones or radiotherapy, if the
cancer progresses. Some studies have suggested that no treatment
results in survival rates equal to those of surgery or of
radiation, but those studies all suffer from flaws that make them
inconclusive [<A HREF="0494garnick.html">see "The Dilemmas of Prostate Cancer," by Marc B.
Garnick; Scientific American, April 1994</A>].

<P>Cancerous prostate tissue can also be treated by <A HREF="http://www.comed.com/Prostate/TreatmentOverview.html#Cryotherapy">cryotherapy</A>
(insertion of a probe cooled with liquid nitrogen) or
interstitial seed implantation, which employs tiny radioactive
pellets whose intense radiation does not penetrate far enough to
reach other tissue. Not enough is known thus far about the side
effects or success rates of either method to permit comparison
with established therapies.

<P>PSA testing has revolutionized our understanding of prostate
cancer and led to a dramatic increase in its detection. As a
result, prostate cancers are being detected far earlier than
before, at a time when most cancers can be treated with a <A HREF="http://www.capcure.org/Welcome.htm">high
probability of cure</A>. Nevertheless, such screening, and the
treatment of tumors once detected, remains among the most
controversial subjects in medicine.

<P>Appropriate studies to determine the value of PSA testing in
reducing the overall rate of death from prostate cancer-or in
extending life in general (given that so many prostate patients
die of other causes)-have simply not been done. Some large,
long-term randomized trials and studies of easily tracked
populations are now under way, including the NCI's Prostate,
<A HREF="0996twelvecancers.html#lung">Lung</A>, <A HREF="0996twelvecancers.html#colon">Colon</A> and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial. Even so, results
will not be available for at least 10 years. Until then, men must
decide for themselves whether the potential life-extending
benefits of PSA screening and treatment outweigh the risks.

The pages that follow provide facts and figures about the 12
cancers that affect the most Americans (excluding basal cell and
squamous cell skin cancers, which are very common but rarely
fatal). Cancer is most successfully treated if detected early.
For this reason, many physicians recommend that people over age
40 have annual health checkups, which can often catch disease
before it produces any symptoms. (People between the ages of 20
and 40 should have checkups every three years.) People who do
have any of the symptoms described are wise to consult a doctor.
None of these symptoms prove that someone has cancer, however-a
firm diagnosis can be made only by a trained oncologist. Readers
wishing to learn about the latest research on particular cancers
can find resources listed in "<A HREF="0996information.html" TARGET="_top">Finding More Information</A>."
<P>Certain characteristics are shared by virtually all cancers.
The risk of the disease developing usually increases with
advancing age. Curing a solid tumor-eliminating all traces of
cancer from the body-generally becomes more difficult the larger
the tumor has grown. Metastasis to distant body locations is more
worrisome than local spreading or no spreading. (The extent of a
cancer's spread is referred to as its stage.) In addition,
examining detailed features of the tumor cells under a microscope
is usually important in evaluating their aggressiveness.
<P><B>Broad categories of cancer treatments include:</B>
<P><UL>
<LI><B>Surgery</B> to remove a tumor or diseased tissue.
It is the primary mode of treatment for most solid tumors. 
<LI><B>Chemotherapy,</B> the use of drugs to kill tumor cells. It,
too, has a role in most cancer treatments. The several classes of
chemotherapeutic drugs act by various means, most frequently by
inhibiting the ability of tumor cells to replicate correctly.
Many drugs are commonly used in combination because tumors may be
unable to defend themselves against a variety of agents attacking
in different ways. The compounds may be introduced into the body
as a whole, or they may be concentrated at the tumor site. 
<LI><B>Radiation</B> to kill tumor cells. Sometimes used as a primary
form of treatment, it is more often an adjunct to other
therapies. The radiation may be aimed at a tumor from outside the
body, or it may be delivered by placing radioactive pellets or
liquid at the cancerous site. 
<LI><B>Biological therapies,</B>
which are based on complex substances found in living
organisms. They include immunotherapies, which attempt to turn
the body's immune system against a cancer. 
<LI><B>Hormone-blocking and hormone-supplementing therapies,</B>
which affect the rate at which tumor cells grow, multiply or die.
<LI><B>Bone marrow transplantation,</B> which is not a therapy
in itself but is sometimes used to strengthen the depleted
blood-making system of a patient weakened by high, potentially
curative doses of radiation or chemotherapies [see "When Are Bone
Marrow Transplants Considered?" by Karen Antman, page 124].
Healthy cells for the transplants may come from other people
(allogeneic donations) or from samples of blood or bone marrow
collected previously from the patient (autologous donations).

<BR>Throughout, survival figures are expressed as relative rates. The
numbers refer to the proportion of people with a disease who are
expected to be alive at a later time, compared with a similar
population that is free of cancer. If the five-year relative
survival rate for a type of cancer is 50 percent, for instance,
there will be half as many survivors in a group of patients as in
a comparable cancer-free group. Relative survival thus reflects
mortality from the cancer alone, correcting for deaths from other
illnesses or accidents. Sadly, survival five years after
diagnosis does not equate with a cure. Some intractable cancers
continue to progress over extended periods, and others may recur
after they seem to be eliminated.

LIVING WITH CANCER
<CENTER><H3>FINDING MORE INFORMATION</H3></CENTER>
Fortunately, access to incisive knowledge about cancer and its
treatment is easier to obtain than ever before. The catch is
knowing what information can be trusted. This problem is
particularly acute on the Internet, where only a fraction of what
is on-line is true, accurate, reliable and up-to-date.
<P>The following resources serve as a good starting point for
beginning a search for more information. When using the World
Wide Web, remember that interlinked sites are not always equally
trustworthy. Patients should discuss the information they find
with their health care providers.

<B>HELIUM FOR SALE</B>
<P>As a reader of <I>Scientific American </I>for two decades, I
appreciated the article "No Light Matter," by Corey S. Powell
[Science and the Citizen, March]. But the writer erred in
claiming that President Bill Clinton and Congress will squander,
rather than conserve, helium. The truth is, the government now
squanders both helium and taxpayers' money. The Bureau of
Mines's helium operation is $1.4 billion in debt, as it competes
with private industry, which produces 90 percent of the world's
helium.<BR><BR>
In April the Helium Privatization Act of 1996, sponsored by
Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts and myself, passed
the House. Under this legislation, the federal government will
sell its helium operation and inventory-not for immediate
consumption but to be maintained in the same underground dome in
Texas where it is stockpiled. The helium will remain available
for scientific and commercial use, just as it is today. One
thing, however, will be different: the millions of dollars in
annual losses will stop, and the $1.4-billion debt to taxpayers
will be repaid.<BR><BR>

<P><HR><B>MEGA-DISCORD OVER NANOTECH </B>
<P>Congratulations on a fine Trends article by Gary Stix
["Waiting
for Breakthroughs," April]. As
much as I liked Richard Feynman's work, including his amusing
1959 lecture, I can't resist drawing parallels between the
frequent appeals to the authority of Feynman by the
nanotechnology crowd with similar claims by the cold-fusion mafia
in the name of Nobel laureate Julian Schwinger. In his last years
Schwinger became isolated from the mainstream scientific
community, and shortly before his death, he wrote down some
theoretical ideas about cold fusion. Thus, every cold-fusion
propaganda piece drips with references to "Nobel laureate Julian
Schwinger." Feynman gave his "nano" lecture at the height of his
intellectual powers, but he did not intend to become a
nano-Moses. Were he still with us, he would either vehemently
reject the appeal to authority or, more likely, play along until
he could turn it into a prank.<BR><BR>
The motivation behind too much of the current promotion of
nanotechnology can be summed up with a quote from the Foresight
Institute Web site: "If you'd like a higher level of involvement,
you may wish to join our Senior Associate program. By pledging an
annual contribution of $250, $500, $1,000, or $5,000 for five
years, you are brought into the circle of those most committed to
making a difference in nanotechnology." I think that says it
all.<BR><BR>
<I>James F. Haw

<P><HR>I was dismayed to read an extended quotation from Feynman's
essay
"Cargo Cult Science" used as a critique of nanotechnology. I am
sure he would have found such misuse of his idea quite
objectionable. I should know because I talked with my father at
length about the prospects of nanotechnology. As the article
itself points out, Feynman saw no basis in physical laws that
would preclude realization of the concepts of nanotechnology. To
claim that nanotechnology is cargo cult science because its
proponents analyze the capabilities of devices not yet
constructed is as absurd as saying that astronautics was cargo
cult science before <I>Sputnik.</I><BR><BR>
If my father were still alive, I think he would have been pleased
to have his name associated with a large cash prize that seeks to
accelerate the realization of one of his most exciting ideas.
That is why I have participated in defining the conditions for
winning the Feynman Grand Prize and have agreed to naming the
prize in his memory.<BR><BR>

was used out of context to ridicule nanotechnology and the
conference we both attended. With a graduate degree in biomedical
engineering as well as dentistry, I do not consider myself an
"aesthete of science and technology."<BR><BR>

Reifman, who was quoted as saying that Drexler is the
messiah, maintains that his comment was made in jest. But he
confirmed the sense of the quote when he was contacted for
fact-checking prior to the article's publication. And with
apologies to Drexler, we think that readers of the critique will
find little in the way of specific cited errors.
<P><HR><B>BLINDED BY THE LIGHT</B><BR><BR>
James Burke's column "Connections" is uniformly a pleasure to
read, but I would like to call your attention to a small slip in
his April piece ["What's in a Name?", Reviews and Commentary,
April]. He correctly describes the Fraunhofer lines in the sun's
spectrum-which are caused by atomic absorption-as dark lines. In
the Kirchhoff-Bunsen flame, however, the lines are not dark but
bright, as they result from atomic emission. I hope this mistake
will fade unnoticed into oblivion, but for a spectroscopist, it
is literally a glaring error.<BR><BR>

<P> "According to one contention, magnesium will eventually replace iron as the world's basic constructional
raw material. Hence, it might be feasible to call the next age of man the 'magnesium age.' The element
appears to be the only 'basic' material of which the supply is inexhaustible: one cubic mile of sea water
contains 9.2 billion pounds of metal in the form of magnesium chloride. It is the lightest of the structural
metals, and magnesium's so-called 'fire hazard' is only a factor when handling fine powders or the molten
metal. However, if magnesium is to become the prime raw material it is not likely to do so for centuries.
Its competitors-iron and steel, aluminum and structural plastics-would have to reach a state of depleted
supply and high prices."

"Interest in the compressed air motor has been shown by the Third Avenue Railroad Company, of New
York, which has adopted the system invented by Mr. R. Hardie. In earlier systems, when the air was
expanded from the storage flasks, the corresponding reduction of temperature was so great as to cause
freezing and choking up of the exhaust passages. In the Hardie system, the cars, one of which is shown in
the accompanying illustration, are similar in their general appearance to an ordinary street car. But
underneath the seats are sixteen air reservoirs, rolled steel flasks 9 inches in diameter and 20 feet long,
and a hot water tank, by means of which the air is heated before it enters the two cylinders of the motor,

we allowed our ship, the Fram, to be closed in by the ice. As anticipated, we drifted northwest during the
autumn and winter. Lieut. Johansen and I left the Fram on March 14, 1895, to explore to the north and
reach the highest latitude possible. We had twenty-eight dogs, two sledges and two kayaks for possible open
water. However, by April 7 the ice had become so rough that I considered it unwise to continue.' They
headed south and after a winter of living on bear and walrus meat in a stone house they had built, the two

been subjected to a more critical examination than ever before. It is stated that there were no vestiges of
architectural remains to show that the moon is or ever was inhabited by a race of mortals similar to
ourselves. The moon presented no appearance that it contained anything like the green-field and lovely

According to one view, there is therefore no doubt that immense quantities of this inflammable substance
abound in the upper regions, and that a spark of electric fire would envelope the world in flames. The only
circumstance preventing such conflagration is that the region of excitable electricity is several miles below

<P><CENTER><H2>PAYING ATTENTION</H2>
The controversy over ADHD <BR>and the drug Ritalin is obscuring a
real look <BR>at the disorder and its underpinnings</CENTER>
<P>When Tom was born, he acted like a "crack baby," his
mother, Ann, says. "He responded violently to even the slightest
touch, and he never slept." Shortly after Tom turned two, the
local day care center asked Ann to withdraw him. They deemed his
behavior "just too aberrant," she remembers. Tom's doctors ran a
battery of tests to screen for brain damage, but they found no
physical explanation for his lack of self-control. In fact, his
IQ was high-even though he performed poorly in school.
<P>Eventually Tom was diagnosed with
attention-deficit/hyperactivity
disorder <A HREF="http://www.nimh.nih.gov/publicat/adhd.htm">(ADHD)</A>-a condition that typically manifests in young
children as inattention or impulsivity and sometimes
hyperactivity. These traits make it difficult for ADHD kids to
sit
still, concentrate and learn. The psychiatrist told Ann that in
terms of severity, Tom was 15 on a scale of one to 10. As
therapy, this doctor prescribed methylphenidate, a drug better
known by its brand name, <A HREF="http://www.mentalhealth.com/drug/p30-r03.html">Ritalin</A>.
<P>Tom is now in fifth grade and lives with his father, Ned, and
his
problems have worsened. Ned has come to doubt that ADHD exists
and took Tom off medication last fall. Many parents have in fact
become suspicious of Ritalin after a recent surge in the number
of children diagnosed with ADHD. By some estimates, as many as 5
to 6 percent of all school-age boys in the U.S. now take Ritalin
for the condition. And production of the drug has shot up some
500 percent since 1990. Ninety percent of the current annual
total, approximately 8.5 tons, is made by Ciba-Geigy and is used
in the U.S.
<P>Skeptics suggest that psychiatrists are too ready to diagnose
a
range of behavioral problems as ADHD and to dismiss them with a
quick chemical fix. This past February the United Nations's
<A HREF="http://www.emory.edu/EMORY_REPORT/erarchive/1995/December/ERdec.4/12.4.95pet.ima">International Narcotics Control Board</A> reported that overdiagnosis
of ADHD was very possibly taking place. In addition, the board
declared that more teenagers were inhaling the stimulant-which is
related to cocaine but is far less
potent-to get high. (Addiction is exceedingly rare.)
<P>No one denies that abuse and misuse arise. Anecdotes abound
about
parents who seek an ADHD diagnosis for their child so that he or
she can study more intently, take more time on tests and get
better grades. Yet many of the pediatricians and psychiatrists
treating ADHD kids believe the real explanation for the seeming
increase in ADHD is far less complex: treatment is just now
catching up to true prevalence. In the meantime, the media circus
surrounding ADHD and Ritalin, they say, is hurting kids, like
Tom, who need medication.
<P>"The number of cases has more than doubled in the past five
years,
and so the chance that overdiagnosis is occurring needs to be
considered," says James M. Swanson of the University of
California at Irvine, "but even so, we are just now reaching the
accepted range of the expected prevalence." Swanson and others
cite several reasons why ADHD may have been previously
underdiagnosed. First, physicians used to take children off
medication when they reached adolescence for fear of long-term
side effects. Now, though, most feel Ritalin is the safest
psychotropic drug available and prescribe it even into
adulthood. Also, ADHD was seldom recognized in girls before 1994,
when the fourth edition of the <I>Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders </I>(<I>DSM-IV</I>) noted a subtype
of ADHD that appears without hyperactivity. ADHD girls are often
not as antsy as affected boys, but they are restless mentally.
<P>"Ritalin use is clearly more common now than ever before, and
so
people are saying that there is some implicit scandal afoot-that
we are giving kids medication rather than dealing with their real
problems," says Russell A. Barkley of the University of
Massachusetts Medical Center. "But that's just blowing smoke."
Edward Hallowell, a child psychiatrist at Harvard University who
treats ADHD and has it himself, agrees: "This sort of criticism
is just another example of what Peter Kramer, author of
<I>Listening to Prozac, </I>calls psychopharmacological
Calvinism." We live in a society that expects you to fix things
yourself, he explains. Relying on any help, be it counseling or
medication, is considered a weakness.
<P>It will be difficult, though, to move from making moral
diagnoses
to medical ones because all the available tests for mental
illness are so subjective. The criteria set forth for ADHD in the
<I><A HREF="http://web.cs.mun.ca/%7Ejamie/dsm4.html">DSM-IV</A></I> require that a child display a range of symptoms,
such as distractibility and a short attention span, that are
excessive for his or her mental age. Moreover, these symptoms
must persist for at least six months and significantly impair
the child's ability to function.
<P>Nearly all children exhibit some of these symptoms some of the
time. And ADHD falls along a spectrum, as do all psychological
disorders. "Where we draw the line along that spectrum determines
how many people have it," Barkley notes. Making diagnosis even
more difficult is the fact that ADHD frequently appears with
other
disorders, including Tourette's syndrome, lead poisoning, fetal
alcohol syndrome and retardation. In addition, many other
conditions-such as depression, manic-depressive illness,
substance abuse, anxiety and personality disorders-share similar
symptoms. 
<P>Nevertheless, the biology behind ADHD is beginning to surface.
"We cannot say which structure or which chemical is wrong,"
emphasizes Alan Zametkin of the National Institute of Mental
Health (NIMH). "ADHD is like fever-any number of causes can be
to blame." But he has found, for example, that a small subset of
ADHD people have a different receptor for thyroid hormone and
that 70 to 80 percent of all people with this very rare
difference in their thyroid receptor have ADHD.
<P>Other studies have found an association between ADHD and three
genes encoding receptors for the neurotransmitter dopamine.
Collaborating with molecular biologists and geneticists at Irvine
and at the University of Toronto, Swanson examined the so-called
novelty-seeking gene, which codes for the dopamine receptor
DRD4. One series of base pairs repeats two, four or seven times.
More repeats are associated with a blunted response to dopamine
signals and less inhibited behavior. "We found that the
seven-repeat variety of the gene is overrepresented among ADHD
children," Swanson says.
<P>Neurochemistry is not the whole story. Scientists have also
discovered structural abnormalities. F. Xavier Castellanos of
the NIMH used magnetic resonance imaging to measure the total
brain volume and several different brain regions in 57 ADHD boys
and 55 healthy control subjects. His team found that the anterior
frontal part of the brain was on average more than 5 percent
smaller on the right side in ADHD boys. The right caudate and the
globus pallidus, too, were smaller. These structures form the
main neural circuit by which the cortex inhibits behavior, and so
damage there might well manifest itself as a lack of impulse
control. Castellanos warns that this result offers but part of
the puzzle: "It's only slightly better than phrenology. Now we're
just measuring the bumps on the inside of the brain."
<P>Another facet of ADHD malfunctioning comes from positron
emission tomography <A HREF="http://www.emory.edu/EMORY_REPORT/erarchive/1995/December/ERdec.4/12.4.95pet.ima">(PET) studies</A>. Julie B. Schweitzer of Emory
University monitored brain activity in ADHD and unaffected men
while they completed a task. Participants heard a series of
numbers, one every 2.4 seconds, and were asked to add the last
two digits they heard. Looking at the PET scans, Schweitzer saw
two major differences between the groups. First, the ADHD
individuals maintained high levels of blood fiow, whereas the
controls displayed deactivation in the temporal gyrus
region-indicating some kind of learning. 
<P>The ADHD group also activated brain areas used for visual
tasks.
"I went back and asked the ADHD subjects if they used some
strategy," Schweitzer says. "Instead of repeating the numbers to
themselves, as some of the controls did, many ADHD patients had 
visualized them." She suggests that this visualization represents
some kind of compensation for impaired cognition elsewhere.
Zametkin, too, has used PET scans to study ADHD. He took images
of parents of ADHD children and found that they exhibit less
brain activity. He concludes, "These kids really are born to be
wild."

Spy satellite technology may <BR>assist government watchdogs</CENTER>
<P>Last year President Bill Clinton signed an order declassifying
hundreds of thousands of photographs taken by the first-generation
of military spy satellites in a program that ended in 1972.
Within another two years, commercial satellite companies plan to
deliver pictures of better quality to anyone with a credit-card
number and a Federal Express or an Internet account. They intend
to sell snapshots from space that can show details as small as a
meter-a close enough view to delineate boats, bridges or houses
anywhere on the planet.
<P>The companies have already publicized the imminent arrival of
high-resolution satellite images as a boon for business. Real

panoramic look at a neighborhood. Travel agents may provide
vacationers with a dramatic overview of a chateau in the Alps.
<P>But perhaps the most intriguing application for this erstwhile
spy technology may be for public-interest groups and news
organizations to keep an eye on government. "When one-meter
black-and-white pictures hit the market, a well-endowed
nongovernmental organization will be able to have pictures better
than [those] the U.S. spy satellites took in 1972 at the time of
the first strategic arms accord," comments remote-sensing and
arms-control expert Peter D. Zimmerman. A case that immediately
comes to mind is the stunning U.S. government satellite and spy
plane images that showed a group of people herded onto a field
near the town of Srebrenica in Bosnia and a newly dug mound of
earth there that suggested the location of a mass grave. A
public-interest group, unencumbered by internal policy debates,
would likely move more quickly than a government in making
similar pictures available.
<P>Human Rights Watch communications director Susan Osnos remarks
that satellite imagery could prove a valuable adjunct to on-site
monitoring visits and testimonials from witnesses when
investigating cases of rights abuses. "Last year when it became
clear that more than 7,000 men were not going to reappear, we
talked about the fact that there were all these surveillance
satellites and that there must therefore be photographic
evidence," Osnos says. "Had we been able to put our hands on the
photos at that time it would have been a very powerful advocacy
tool."
<P>One organization, the Federation of American Scientists (FAS),
has recently launched an initiative, called <A HREF="http://www.fas.org/eye/">Public Eye</A>, to
promote the use of intelligence technologies, including one-meter
imagery. "Information is power," says John E. Pike, an analyst
with the FAS. "But before it was only available to a superpower.
Now it will be available to any organization or individual for a
few thousand bucks. This has the potential to expand the range of
issues on which nongovernmental actors make news."
<P>The work of a Norwegian graduate student, Einar Bj&#248;rgo,
presages how remote sensing may help <A HREF="http://www.nrsc.no:8001/~einar/UN/refmon.html">international relief
efforts</A>. Bj&#248;rgo, a student at the Nansen Environmental and
Remote Sensing Center at the University of Bergen, has used 1992
images with two-meter resolution from a Russian spy satellite to
show how the size of refugee camps in the Sudan can be estimated.
Bj&#248;rgo obtained
the pictures from a Russian company that has marketed slightly
out-of-date satellite imagery for several years.
<P>The news media will also benefit from improved views from on
high. For the past decade, some journalists have offered more
incisive coverage with satellite pictures. ABC News has merged
less distinct satellite images with digital map information to
create computerized landscape representations for stories on the
Persian Gulf War or North Korean nuclear facilities. But Mark
Brender, a producer at ABC News, still laments not having access
in 1990 to high-resolution images, which would have shown Iraqi
tank columns moving into Kuwait. Lower-quality pictures, procured
by ABC from the Russians, were not enough to elicit the necessary
detail. 
<P>These same images, with roughly five-meter resolution, did
provide enough information for remote-sensing expert Zimmerman
to ascertain that overall Iraqi troop buildups had been
overstated by the Bush administration, a fact subsequently
acknowledged by government officials. Zimmerman was working
under contract to the <I>St. Petersburg Times, </I>which
published a story on his findings. One-meter imagery would have
made his job much easier. "I would have been able to make
conclusions with extremely high confidence," he declares. "I
would have been able to see individual vehicles on the road."
<P>The growing interest in satellite news gathering has gained
enough momentum for American University professor Christopher
Simpson to set up the Project on Satellite Imagery and the News
Media at the university's School of Communication. The group
has put together <A HREF="http://gurukul.ucc.american.edu/earthnews/">guides for journalists</A> that contain legal
background relating to satellite imagery usage and public sources
of satellite data available on the Internet.
<P>Whatever the uses, the future of one-meter imaging will depend
on a successful launch by at least one of three companies-Space
Imaging, Orbital Sciences and EarthWatch, all of which plan
during the next two years to put up satellites that will circle
the earth at an altitude of a few hundred miles. The fate of the
high-resolution commercial market will also rely on a measure of
government leniency.
<P>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which
licenses commercial satellites, held hearings in mid-June on
updating a regulation that gives the government broad latitude in
imposing "shutter control"-that is, the right to restrict
satellite data deemed to compromise national security or foreign
policy. Media representatives want satellite pictures to be
guaranteed First Amendment protections that will make it difficult
to bar access to the images. Besides domestic limits, satellite
companies may have to contend with blackouts imposed overseas.
Citing national security, Israel has reportedly asked the U.S.
government to restrict the resolution of detail in commercial
satellite pictures of its territory to no less than three meters.
Only time will tell whether governments get a bad case of cold
war feet.

<CENTER><H2>THE WALL FALLS</H2>
A half-century-old equation <BR>for fiuid dynamics is in doubt</CENTER>
<P>Alexandre Chorin and Grigory Barenblatt had been studying
turbulence from different perspectives for more than 30 years
when they met this past February at the University of California
at Berkeley. Chorin works in computational fiuid dynamics,
calculating the theoretical properties of idealized turbulent
fiow. Barenblatt is a mathematician who studies the "scaling
laws" that engineers employ to extrapolate results from
wind-tunnel tests and other small-scale experiments to the real
world.
<P>But the two saw ground for collaboration: theoretical studies
of turbulence have been limited for some years by the
mathematical formulations of fiuid fiow. Even after extensive
refinement of experimental apparatus, discrepancies remained
between predicted results and actual measurements. The only way
to go forward was to go back and reexamine the foundations of the
field, Barenblatt recalls.
<P>The foundation they revisited was the Law of the Wall, an
equation formulated in the 1930s by Theodor von Karman to
describe the forces that turbulent fiows exert on solid objects.
In doing so, Barenblatt claims, von K&#225;rm&#225;n made a simplifying
assumption that seemed so obvious no one questioned it for nearly
50 years: while investigating the viscosity, or resistance to
fiow, caused by turbulent eddies, von K&#225;rm&#225;n and others ignored
the minuscule viscosity added by the random thermal motion of
individual molecules.
<P>This tiny molecular viscosity sometimes has disproportionate
effects. When Chorin and Barenblatt rederived the law to take the
jostling molecules into account, they found that under some
conditions-particularly, at higher speeds and pressures-the
force exerted by a turbulent fiow was significantly higher than
that predicted by the old equation. The new version's predictions
for the transfer of heat in a turbulent fiow differ even further
from earlier ones. In a way, molecular viscosity behaves like the
notorious butterfiy wing of chaos theory, whose delicate fiapping
could trigger a chain of events leading to monsoons half a world
away.
<P>Reaction to the new formula has been mixed. Older fiuid
dynamists have spent their careers adhering to the old Law of the
Wall, Barenblatt says, and some of them are unwilling to see it
pass without rigorous examination of its replacement. If it is
confirmed, the revised version could have significant implications
for systems as disparate as industrial heat exchangers and global
climate models. Boilers, air conditioners and other devices
might have to be redesigned with new proportions to improve their
efficiency and lengthen their working lives.
<P>Luckily, one application of fiuid dynamics that will be less
affected is aircraft design-aeronautical engineers have never
used the Law of the Wall directly, Barenblatt says. (Instead they
have relied on extensive experimental data backed by tried and
true scaling rules.) What the new law may do, he predicts, is to
make turbulence easier for many engineers to understand-creating
a smoother fiow from theory to practice.

<CENTER><H2>MUSSEL MAYHEM, CONTINUED</H2>
Apparent benefits of the zebra mussel <BR>plague are anything
but</CENTER>
<P>When the first <A HREF="http://www.science.wayne.edu/%7Ejram/zmussel.htm">zebra mussels</A> were spotted in Lake Erie in 1988,
the Cassandras had a field day. Within weeks, there were
predictions that the incredibly hardy, prolific creatures would
bring on ecological and financial disaster as they wreaked havoc
with the lake's food chain and clogged the water-intake systems
of electric power stations, boat motors and drinking-water
facilities.
<P>In fact, in many ways the disaster did not live up to
expectations. Chlorine and other chemicals have kept the pesky
crustaceans away from intakes at far lower costs than were
feared. Moreover, there have even been some apparent benefits. The
fat little critters are prodigious filterers, absorbing surprising
amounts of a variety of pollutants from the water and storing
them in their lipids. They have also consumed so much algae,
their main food, that large parts of the lake have become visibly
clearer. 
<P>Previously scarce aquatic plants, which were fighting a losing
battle to the pollution-nourished algae, are thriving once again.
Eel grass-an indigenous plant that Ohio was on the verge of
declaring endangered in 1988-has rebounded so thoroughly that
huge, tangled underwater forests of it now gently sway over the
lake bed. The vegetation snags on the propellers of pleasure
boats near Put-in-Bay, a tourist town on South Bass Island in the
lake's western basin. Can it be that the zebra mussel infestation
has actually been a boon?
<P>Alas, no, say local zoologists studying the infestation. Yes,
zebra mussels have absorbed so much pollution that experts now
estimate that 50 percent of the contaminants that had been in
Lake St. Clair, a 1,200-square-kilometer body of water between
Lake Erie and Lake Huron, are now in zebra mussel tissue. And,
yes, in great sections of Lake Erie, the water is 600 percent
clearer than it was. But if these facts seem like bright spots in
a dark cloud, they are more lightning than silver lining.
<P>Zebra mussels are living filters, says Susan W. Fisher, a
professor in the entomology department at Ohio State
University. Each adult mussel sucks in as much as a liter and a
half of water a day, retaining algae and other nutrients and,
incidentally, PCBs, dioxins, polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons
and whatever other contaminants happen to be in the water and
sediments where the mussels feed. (The current population filters
the entire western basin of Lake Erie every five to seven days.)
Some of the toxins wind up in the animals' fat tissue-the mussels
are a rather ample 15 percent fat by weight, Fisher notes.
<P>Billions of mussels with contaminated fat may not seem like a
big problem, but ecologists are concerned. For example, the
mussels' corpses and feces, which are also contaminated, are
important links in a food chain extending to anyone who eats fish
from the Great Lakes. "The point is, it may have been safer to
have the contaminants in the sediments," says Jeffrey M. Reutter,
who is director of Ohio State's Stone Laboratory, the oldest
freshwater biological field station in the U.S.
<P>Fisher is now trying to determine whether the contaminants are
reaching dinner tables in concentrations high enough to be
troubling. "It may take a couple of years to know if there's a
wholesale rearrangement of contaminant concentrations going on in
the lake," she says.
<P>The mussels' reduction of artificially high levels of some
kinds of algae in Lake Erie may also have had devastating
repercussions. Algae is the base of the food chain for all the
lake's creatures, so its rapid loss on such an enormous scale may
have caused fundamental changes, Reutter and Fisher suggest. For
example, not only zebra mussels but also zooplankton subsist on
algae. And the lake's food fish-walleyes, bass, trout and yellow
perch-eat zooplankton at critical points in their lives but very
rarely consume zebra mussels.
<P>Before the infestation, Lake Erie, which is by far the most
heavily fished of the Great Lakes, supported fisheries with an
economic value of $600 million a year. During the early 1990s,
with food fish apparently much scarcer, the value was down to
$200 million a year. Reutter comments, however, that scientists
have not yet conclusively linked zebra mussels to declining
zooplankton populations or fisheries or to a few other baffling
phenomena, such as the appearance of gigantic blooms of certain
toxic algae species not eaten by zebra mussels. Scientists are
also trying to determine if these and other changes have
endangered the lake's entire ecosystem.
<P>Whether the invertebrate intruder is ultimately blamed or not,
Fisher has already reached one conclusion on her own. "Every
little benefit you get out of them," she warns, "is not worth the
problems."

Space weather forecasting <BR>comes of age</CENTER>
<P>On March 26 of this year, the <I>Anik E1</I>
telecommunications satellite lost power in one of its solar panel
arrays, temporarily interrupting voice, video and data service
for its owner, Telesat Canada. In the past, such a mishap might
have been vaguely attributed to component failure. But this time,
Daniel Baker of the University of Colorado identified a more
specific culprit: a bout of inclement space weather.
<P>Outbursts of magnetic fiux and charged particles from the sun
episodically roil interplanetary space and agitate the earth's
magnetic field. These disturbances have long been known to induce
surges in power grids and to interfere with long-distance
navigation and communications signals. Improved understanding of
space weather is revealing the true magnitude of the problem, as
experienced by <I>Anik E1. </I>Ernest Hildner, director of the
<A HREF="http://www.sel.noaa.gov/">Space Environment Center</A> (SEC) in Boulder, Colo., warns that the
situation is only going to get worse. With their miniaturized
circuits and reduced overall size, modern satellites are
increasingly vulnerable, even as their total number continues to
grow. Meanwhile the sun is likely to turn ever more restless as
it progresses through its current 11-year activity cycle. 
<P>To help ameliorate the potential losses, the SEC collects
data on the space environment around the clock. It relies in part
on a new generation of scientific probes-most notably <I>POLAR,
WIND</I> and <I>SOHO,</I> spacecraft residing upstream of the
earth in the solar wind-that monitor the behavior of the sun and
relay information about conditions in interplanetary space. The
SEC can now predict general space weather up to three days in
advance. Anyone doubting how far the study of space weather has
come need only visit the SEC site on the World Wide Web, which contains detailed, constantly
updated records and forecasts.
<P>The SEC is now working in collaboration with the National
Weather Service's "weather wire" to warn via radio of severe
space weather, much as the weather service would send out an
alert for a hurricane or tornado. In addition, the National
Science Foundation recently organized a National Space Weather
Program to coordinate and disseminate research from several
agencies, primarily the U.S. Air Force and the SEC.
<P>A key goal of that program is to make space weather
information available in a format that is useful to the
companies and individuals who could most benefit from it. "Right
now there is a problem in reporting to the public," notes Captain
Amanda Preble, chief of space weather programs at the air force's
Directorate of Weather. "This is not like a tornado that you can
show people." That situation is beginning to change; the rich
data streams coming from the spacecraft will soon make it
possible to construct interactive, three-dimensional models of
space weather. 
<P>As a result, engineers facing turbulent space weather can
think more carefully about their options. Utility companies are
starting to monitor geomagnetic activity and may set aside
additional reserve capacity during solar storms; cellular
telephone companies could warn customers about potential
transmission failures; in extreme cases, operators might place
satellites in "sleep" mode or prepare to retransmit software
commands that could be lost in a storm of charged particles.
"People used to laugh, to consider our work very 'farfetched,' "
Preble recalls, "but it is already proving to be
useful." <I>-Corey S. Powell</I>

<P>Poor <I>Tyrannosaurus rex</I> has been dwarfed, again. Fossils
unearthed in the Kem Kem region of Morocco point to the existence
of a dinosaur whose head was five feet, four inches long (1.6
meters), just slightly larger than that of <I>T. rex. </I>The
discovery of <I>Carcharodontosaurus, </I>or "shark-toothed
reptile," by Paul C. Sereno of the University of Chicago and his
colleagues comes right after the finding last year of
<I>Giganotosaurus</I> in Argentina. The South American giant and
its new African counterpart-along with Sereno's other Moroccan
find, a smaller species called <I>Deltadromeus, </I>or "delta
runner"-are also helping scientists understand exactly when the
continents split apart.
<P>Paleogeographers believe that by the end of the Jurassic, some
150 million years ago, the ancient supercontinent Pangaea split
into a section called Laurasia, which moved north, and Gondwana,
which remained in the south. This idea is supported by fossils
showing an evolutionary schism: species unique to each landmass
sprung up at about the same time. But until now, this evidence
had been restricted to Asia, Europe and South America.
<P>The Moroccan bones-the first major dinosaur fossils to be
unearthed in Africa-provide data suggesting that Pangaea's
initial subdivision was not complete. <I>Carcharodontosaurus</I>
and <I>Deltadromeus</I> both appear to have lived during the
Upper Cretaceous, approximately 100 million years ago. Because
this date is 50 million years after the purported
Laurasia-Gondwana divide, scientists expected the African
dinosaurs to be more closely related to those from the southern
continents, such as South America. That, however, is not what
they found.
<P>Both African species are very similar to dinosaurs that roamed
what is now North America some 100 million years ago. This
discovery, along with the age of the new fossils, suggests that
land bridges and shallow seas between Laurasia and Gondwana
allowed dinosaur species to move and intermix throughout the
Upper Cretaceous-some 90 million years ago and 60 million years
later than was thought.

<CENTER><H2>MOUSE TO FATHER RAT?</H2>
Renewable reproductive cells <BR>could transform fatherhood</CENTER>
<P>Mary had a little lamb-and the doctors were surprised," runs a
warped version of the nursery rhyme analyzed by the linguist
Steven Pinker in his book <I>The Language Instinct. </I>Today the
doctors would still be very surprised. But the prospect of a
mouse siring a rat, at least, has suddenly become an imminent
reality, thanks to a technique developed at the University of
Pennsylvania. The process-transplantation of cells that produce
sperm-could also allow mammals, including humans, to father
multiple offspring years after their death.
<P>The researchers describe in the May 30 issue of <I><A HREF="http://www.nature.com/">Nature</A></I>
how they transplanted sperm-producing cells called spermatogonia
from rat testes into mice testes, where the cells made seemingly
normal rat sperm that may be capable of fertilizing rat eggs. A
companion paper in the June issue of <I><A HREF="http://medicine.nature.com/">Nature Medicine</A></I>
reports that the spermatogonia can be deep-frozen in liquid
nitrogen for long periods-156 days, so far-before they are
successfully implanted. The transplanted cells were genetically
marked to prove that they were indeed the progenitors of sperm in
the recipient testes. The investigators suppressed the immune
systems of the mice so they would not reject the foreign rat
tissue.
<P>These findings, made by a group headed by Ralph L. Brinster,
are being hailed as a breakthrough that could have far-reaching
applications in medicine, livestock breeding and the preservation
of endangered species. They are all the more remarkable because
they are, by the standards of modern biological research, fairly
simple. The microinjection of the spermatogonia into the mice was
done by Mary R. Avarbock, a postgraduate student in Brinster's
lab. Recognizing the implications, the university has moved
quickly to file patent applications.
<P>Veterinary and medical researchers learned decades ago how to
freeze and store sperm for later use. But thawed sperm often
loses much of its fertilizing capacity. The spermatogonia used in
Brinster's experiments include stem cells that may represent an
inexhaustible supply. Moreover, they appear to be fairly robust,
which is one reason why researchers are rhapsodizing about the
possibilities raised by Brinster's research. Men facing
chemotherapy that causes sterility may be able to bank some
spermatogonia, then have them reimplanted later. Spermatogonia
from an endangered species might be used to generate sperm in
the testes of a more common species. The resulting sperm could
be used to create embryos via in vitro fertilization, and the
embryos might then be implanted into the uterus of a closely
related foster species.
<P>Another tantalizing possibility is that spermatogonial stem
cells from many species might be susceptible to gene targeting, a
technique in which biologists design molecules to "knock out" a
specific gene in a cell that is incorporated into a developing
animal. Some of the animal's offspring lack the targeted gene
entirely. Gene targeting can be done now in mice, but "it is a
problem with other species," says David E. Clouthier, a member
of the Pennsylvania team who is now at the University of Texas
Southwestern Medical Center. The difficulty is that gene
targeting makes use of embryonic stem cells, which have proved
impossible to isolate in livestock and in humans.
<P>If spermatogonia from most mammals can be propagated and used
for gene knockouts, livestock breeding may never be the same
again. And if the technique works in humans, artificial genetic
manipulation of the germ line-long the province of science
fiction-will suddenly become a perfectly feasible prospect.
Addressing the ethical implications of the new developments in
reproductive biology "is an ongoing process," Clouthier says.
Not many years ago ethicists were declaring that manipulation of
the germ line was unthinkable, but that, in any case, it wasn't
feasible in the foreseeable future. That future now seems a lot
more foreseeable. <I>-Tim Beardsley in Washington, D.C.</I>

Worried that you have bad breath? Unless vultures are actually
circling your mouth, there's good news. The problem may not be
your breath at all, but your personality.
<P>Researchers at Tel Aviv University decided to study just how
bad the breath really was of 38 people whose concerns about their
oral malodor drove them to seek medical attention. The
researchers published the results in a recent issue of
<I>Psychosomatic Medicine</I>. Sixteen patients had themselves
come to the conclusion that they had a problem. Another 12 were
driven to this conclusion-they claimed that others had
complained. The last 10 were getting input from both sides,
having decided for themselves that they reeked but having also
found the telltale gift-wrapped bottle of mouthwash in their desk
drawer.
<P>As part of the study, the 38 subjects rated their own breath
on a scale of zero to 10, where zero was presumably something
like minty roses and 10 must have been whatever Linda Blair
ejected onto the priest in <I>The Exorcist</I> that made him lose
his faith. They also mouth-breathed from a distance of 10
centimeters right into the face of an "odor judge," who similarly
rated the scent from zero to 10. To put the whole thing in
perspective, the odor judge produced a baseline bad-breath value
by assigning a rank rank for a control sample: dung-based
fertilizer. The study subjects likewise rated the fertilizer, to
prove that they did not suffer from anosmia-loss of sense of
smell.
<P>When the dust settled and the bodies were carted off, the
ratings got analyzed, leading to some fascinating insights. Both
the odor judge and the subjects rated the fertilizer at about
nine on the stink scale. But whereas the odor judge rated the
subjects on average to be far closer to mint than to manure, at
2.7, the study group assigned itself an average score suitable to
grow a decent corn crop with-6.7.
<P>Because the patients completed a psychological profile, the
researchers were able to note higher than normal values for
interpersonal sensitivity and obsession-compulsion. Increased
interpersonal sensitivity may cause some to blame breath for
their "self-consciousness and negative expectations regarding
interpersonal communications," the study states, whereas
obsession-compulsion can lead to "increased involvement with
personal hygiene in general and with oral odors in particular."
Either way, it may be of some comfort to know that bad breath,
unlike beauty, may be in the mind of the nose holder. <I>-Steve
Mirsky</I>

<CENTER><H2>INSECTS OF GENERATION X</H2></CENTER>
<P>A dozen reporters gather in New Haven, Conn., at Yale
University's Peabody Museum of Natural History to hear Charles L.
Remington speak in animated tones about the momentous event that
is under way. In a nearby park, a group  of astonishingly
long-lived insects is about to make a rare appearance. And
Remington, an entomologist of diverse interests, is doing all he
can to enlist the help of journalists to ensure that people far
and wide take notice.
<P>The insect in the spotlight is the cicada. But the
entomological star is not the ordinary, late-summer variety (the
so-called dog-day cicada that noisily visits suburban backyards
every year). The focus is on <I>Magicicada septendecim, </I>a
species that is unique to the eastern U.S. <I>M. septendecim
</I>lives most of its 17-year life underground, tapping fluids
from tree roots for sustenance. With an uncanny sense of timing,
these insects dig their way to the surface in the late spring of
their 17th year, shed their final nymphal skin and populate a
patch of forest. During their few weeks of adult life, they mate,
deposit eggs in twigs and provide a feast for the birds that
happen to notice that something special is occurring.
<P>The emergence of such a brood is indeed quite something for
local predatory birds-and for scientists. Returning to the cicada
colony after the formal media tour has ended, I encounter Stephen
A. Marshall, an entomologist from the University of Guelph in
Ontario, who has driven for 20 hours to visit the site.
Marshall's research involves fly systematics, but he nonetheless
desired to see this extraordinary phenomenon firsthand. He likens
the event unfolding around us to other classic wonders of the
insect world, such as the bioluminescent glowworm of New Zealand
or the sacred scarab beetle of Egypt.
<P>"It's a big, pretty animal that appears once every 17 years,"
notes Marshall, in an attempt to convey some insect aesthetics.
He reminds me that this species is a textbook example of how
insects adopt complicated mechanisms to avoid being preyed on.
Cicadas are a particularly enticing food for birds, which tend to
gorge on them: "We've had several reports of birds vomiting
cicadas," Remington explains, "like a little kid with Grandma's
cookies." Periodical cicadas, which live for either 17 or 13
years (depending on location), appear to have evolved their
underground existence in an effort to escape being devoured into
extinction. The strategy relies on outliving one's foes. Should
bird populations expand as a result of the availability of these
meaty insects, the predator's numbers will then fall over the
next decade or more while the cicadas remain safely underground.
<P>Watching the cicadas crawl over scattered shrubs, I find it
difficult to acknowledge fully the longevity of these insects.
(This species is perhaps the longest-lived insect in the world.)
Indeed, I must constantly remind myself that the creatures
drawing our attention are as old as many of Yale's incoming
students. Marshall, positioning himself to take a close-up
photograph, coaxes his young son not to disturb a nymphal cicada
that has just emerged from the ground. Yes, Alexander, I murmur
to myself, do show some respect for your elders.

<B>Debunking Bad Anthropology.</B> Irked by the half-baked
anthropology on view at many World Wide Web sites, Candice
Bradley, a cultural anthropologist at Lawrence University,
started her own page: <A HREF="http://www.lawrence.edu/dept/anthropology/classics.html">Classics of Out(land)ish Anthropology</A>. 
On it
she lampoons the scientific solecisms that catch her eye, from
news of Bigfoot to a Web site offering "evidence"-aired on
NBC-that humans lived at the time of the dinosaurs ("Human
footprints found side-by-side with dinosaur tracks"). One of her
favorite targets is the Project Candide Web site; it contains the
saga of a trip to Tanzania and Kenya that begins with the
voyagers having pizza for the "last time" before departing the
U.S. "This is typical of the biased representations of Africa on
the Web," Bradley says. "In fact, there are more good restaurants
in Nairobi than in most U.S. cities. Pizza is abundant." She
also remarks on the safari's maps. They "are tinted with a
sienna background so that they resemble 17th- or 18th-century
maps of Africa. They are classic examples of the nostalgia for
precolonialism and colonialism so prevalent in depictions of
things African." 
<P><B>Faxing to E-mail.</B> Two years ago Jaye Muller, a
German-born rapper and rock singer, searched for a handy way to
receive his faxes with his e-mail. No such service existed, so he
created one. Now 24 years old and living in New York City, Muller
is president of <A HREF="http://www.jfax.net">a company that links personal fax numbers to
e-mail addresses</A>-fax to the number, and the document, including
graphics and signatures, will appear in the recipient's e-mail
in-box. Received as a compressed graphic bit-map file, the fax
arrives as a MIME-encoded e-mail attachment. (MIME is the
emerging Internet standard for binary attachments to e-mail-that
is, for attachments other than plain text, which is sent in
ASCII.) His company plans to add voice-mail messages that will
also arrive as MIME-encoded e-mail attachments, neatly providing
a unified service for fax, voice and e-mail transmission.

<B>The Other White Fish</B>
<P>Sea lamprey. These slimy, eellike parasites normally suck the
life out of trout and salmon fisheries in the Great Lakes. The
Great Lakes Fishery Commission traps 50,000 to 100,000 lamprey
every year-sterilizing and releasing the males and sending the
females to the landfill. But researchers from the Sea Grant
Program at the University of Minnesota at Duluth have a new plan:
sell them to the Portuguese! There lampreys are considered a
tasty meal. Sea Grant will send a sampler of 80 females overseas
this summer.
<P><HR><B>Making Memories</B>
<P>As people age, an enzyme called prolyl endopeptidase (PEP)
increasingly degrades the neuropeptides involved in learning and
memory. In Alzheimer's disease and senile dementia, the process
is accelerated, causing memory loss and a shortened attention
span. But now researchers in Suresnes, France, have found
compounds that prevent PEP from breaking neuropeptides apart. In
tests, these chemicals almost completely restored memories in
amnesiac rats.
<P><HR><B>Destruction of Smallpox Postponed...</B>
<P>Until the summer of 1999 at least, now say officials from the
World Health Organization. The killer bacterium was eradicated
in 1977, but samples of it have remained under guard in the U.S.
and in Russia. The new deadline for destroying those remaining
vials is in fact the third to be set. Two earlier dates passed
while scientists debated the value of thoroughly studying the
virus's genetics before eliminating it.
<P><HR><B>Pesticides on the Rise</B>
<P>A draft report from the Environmental Protection Agency
issued this past May states that the use of active pesticide
ingredients rose from 1.23 billion pounds in 1994 to 1.25 billion
pounds in 1995. Many environmental groups fear the numbers are
somewhat misleading because the EPA did not take into account
inert ingredients, wood preservatives or disinfectants, which can
also be toxic.
<P><HR><B>Case Closed</B>
<P>After 84 years, the Piltdown hoax may be solved. In 1912
Arthur Smith Woodward-keeper of paleontology at London's Natural
History Museum-hailed bones from Piltdown, England, as the
Missing Link. But some 50 years later it became clear that a
criminal-and not evolution-had joined the human skull and
orangutan jaw. Recently two scientists analyzed similarly stained
specimens in an old trunk bearing the initials M.A.C.H. and, at
last, fingered the perpetrator: Martin A. C. Hinton, a curator of
zoology, who had warred with Woodward over wages.
<P><HR><B>Cooperative Crustacea</B>
<P>A new study shows that <I>Synalpheus regalis</I>-snapping
shrimp that dwell within sponges on Caribbean coral reefs-are
eusocial. Colonies contain a single reproductive female and
workers that help to defend her. Many eusocial creatures, such
as bees and ants, are a haplodiploid species-that is, males
develop from unfertilized eggs and females from fertilized ones.
But <I>S. regalis </I>males and females both come from
fertilized, or diploid, eggs-as do naked mole rats, another
eusocial creature. The discovery marks the first case of
eusociality in crustaceans.
<P><HR><B>Budget Woes</B>
<P>The American Association for the Advancement of Science
(AAAS) has recently analyzed the budget plans for fiscal year
1997 put forth by the president and the House of
Representatives. Both proposals, the AAAS says, mean a reduction
of nearly 25 percent by the year 2002 in nondefense research and
development-a dramatic cut.
<P><HR><B>Letting Loose</B>
<P>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the
Italian Space Agency have at last released a 358-page report
explaining why, on the space shuttle <I>Columbia</I>'s most
recent mission, the Tethered Satellite broke free. Something
caused a break in the insulation surrounding the tether's
conductor. Current from this copper wire then jumped to a nearby
electrical grounding site. The current burned through much of the
tether until, finally, it snapped.
<P><HR><B>Name That Bug</B>
<P>To identify annoying garden pests, northern Californians can
now call 1-900-225-BUGS between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. Set up and
staffed by members of the entomology department at the University
of California at Davis, the hot line costs $2 for the first
minute and $1 for each additional minute. This program is modeled
after a successful one in Minnesota. And remember, you must be
infested to call.
<P><HR><B>Catching Cervical Cancer</B>
<P>The Food and Drug Administration recently approved a better
method for cervical cancer screening. The disease, which kills
some 4,900 women annually, is highly treatable when caught early.
To examine cervical cells, doctors have traditionally smeared a
tissue sample-containing blood cells and mucus-against a glass
slide (a Pap smear). In the new technique, cervical cells are
filtered from the tissue sample first and then applied in a thin
layer to the slide, making detection far easier.
<P><HR><B>FOLLOW-UP</B>
<P><HR><B>Ozone Depletion Decreasing</B>
<P>Chemists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration say the average concentration of ozone-depleting
chemicals in the lower atmosphere is falling off fast. Based on
their calculations, the amount had decreased some 1 percent by
the middle of last year. The decline suggests that the Montreal
Protocol-a treaty banning the production of CFCs and other
halogenated compounds-is having a real effect. (See September
1995, page 18.)
<P><HR><B>Canned Software</B>
<P>According to a letter written in June by Congressman Floyd D.
Spence, chairman of the House National Security Committee, the
U.S. Army will terminate its Sustaining Base Information Systems
program at the end of fiscal year 1997. The program was to have
replaced some 3,700 computer systems by 2002. To date, the army
has spent more than $150 million yet has received only a handful
of replacement systems. (See April 1996, page 34.)

<CENTER><H2>MAGNET ON THE BRAIN</H2>
Safer neurosurgery <BR>with magnetically steered implants</CENTER>
<P>Children often learn about magnetism by dragging a
paper clip through a paper maze with the aid of a magnet held
below. Researchers now hope that before long they will accomplish
a similar feat in the maze of the human brain with a refined
version of a procedure called stereotaxis. The technique, being
tested by workers at Stereotaxis, a firm in St. Louis, and at the
Washington University School of Medicine, would allow physicians
to reach diseased areas of the brain with the least possible
damage to healthy tissue.
<P>Stereotaxis is the procedure in which surgeons plunge, say,
needles or electrodes straight through the brain to treat a
trouble spot deep within. In the process, they tear
healthy and perhaps essential neural tissue-a risk complicated if
several needles or electrodes need to be inserted, as is
sometimes the case. (For instance, to treat Parkinson's disease
stereotaxically, six drug-delivering needles would be inserted in
different spots to saturate fully the deep-seated striatum, which
contains the defective tissue.) Physicians try to minimize
surgical damage by first reviewing a brain-scan image and then
avoiding the most crucial areas.
<P>The magnetic version of stereotaxis is in principle less
destructive. Surgeons would insert a magnetic pellet the size of
a rice grain into a small hole drilled into the skull of a
patient. The patient's head would then be placed in a housing the
size of a small washing machine, which contains six
superconducting magnets. Using a magnetic resonance image as a
guide, surgeons would then direct the pellet through the brain by
adjusting the forces of the various magnets. The pellet could tow
a catheter, electrode or other device to minister to the
troublesome neural tissue.
<P>With magnetic steering, surgeons can dodge especially critical
neurons. Moreover, they would also be able to move the pellet
around within the entire damaged area. A patient being treated
for Parkinson's would, therefore, have only one path of neurons
damaged, as opposed to six with the conventional method.
<P>The chief obstacle to applying this technique in the past,
notes Ralph G. Dacey, Jr., of Washington University, who
directs the stereotaxis research team, has been accurately
controlling the magnetic fields. A decade ago, however, Matthew A.
Howard III, then a physics student at the University of
Virginia, realized that the precise instruments physicists use to
measure gravity could be applied to the control of magnetic
fields. That recognition, coupled with improved computers and
brain-imaging devices, enabled investigators to fashion the
magnetic stereotaxis system, explains Howard, now a neurosurgeon
who assists the researchers in St. Louis from his base at the
University of Iowa.
<P>The team has demonstrated the technique on brains from dead
mammals and one from a live pig, as well as on a block of
gelatin, which has about the same consistency as the human brain.
For the moment, other neurosurgeons remain cautious about the
system's prospects, and Stereotaxis, which holds the patent on
the technique, is the only company committed to this kind of
magnetic neurosurgery.
<P>Howard says that although the hardware for magnetic
stereotaxis will probably cost more than the conventional
technology, it might nonetheless save money by reducing
operating time by one half to two thirds. The technology could
also be broadened to include use in other parts of the body, such
as the liver or blood vessels.
<P>"The challenge," Dacey remarks, "is to find the best
complementary use of conventional stereotaxic surgery and specific
situations for magnetic stereotaxis." He plans to apply to the
Food and Drug Administration before summer's end for approval to
start tests with the new method on humans. The first
clinical trials, probably for biopsies, could begin next
year.

<CENTER><H2>TOO MUCH FOR TOO LITTLE</H2>
The Patent Office is swamped with<BR>gene sequences it can't
afford to check</CENTER>
<P>Every gene sequence that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office
receives must be checked for novelty and obviousness. The PTO
uses two massive parallel-processing computers that compare the
sequences against five databases; this electronic search is then
evaluated by an examiner and, often, a senior examiner. All
fairly straightforward.
<P>The problem is that to do this the PTO needs tens of millions
of dollars and 100 years-and that's just to review the pending
patents. According to John Doll, head of the PTO group that
handles gene patents, it takes about 65 hours and $5,000 to
examine a batch of 100 sequences. But the application fee is only
about $800, and some applicants, including Incyte Pharmaceuticals
in Palo Alto, Calif., and Human Genome Sciences in Rockville,
Md., submit thousands of sequences in an application. As
equipment becomes more powerful and automated analysis enables
sequences to be tested more quickly for potential
pharmaceutical uses, even more applications will be submitted.
<P>In April the PTO held hearings on this crisis in La Jolla,
Calif., and Arlington, Va. Commissioner Bruce A. Lehman and
attendees suggested possible remedies: raising application fees,
bringing in additional examiners or seeking assistance from other
agencies. Industry representatives testified that part of the
difficulty is that the PTO is doing excessive sequence analysis
and that its databases have redundant sequences that slow down
analysis. 
<P>A similar muddle is slowing down another division of the PTO
as well. When a software idea is submitted, it has to be compared
with more than a million "prior art" items from the past 30
years. (Prior art is any earlier patent, journal article, book or
news story that anticipates the invention.) Examiners have yet to
be provided access to the databases and tools they need. The
Patent Office seems to be suffering from too much of a new thing.

<P>With just a tap of your finger, imagine unlocking your house,
withdrawing money from your bank account or even shopping. It may
seem like a futurist fantasy, but electronic fingerprint
identification can no longer be relegated to the realm of science
fiction.
<P>Although the technology has been in the works for a few
years-and New York City-area airports have used it on a limited
scale since 1994-it is finally becoming widespread. This past
April the New York City police department contracted with two
companies specializing in biometric security systems-MORPHO
Systems and <A HREF="http://206.66.64.21/Index.htm">Identix</A>-to install a fingerprint identification
system. Now an officer will be able to scan a suspect's
fingerprints into a database, take a digitized mug shot, type in
other details and then electronically send the entire package to
headquarters. The system is expected to be more accurate than
current paperwork procedures, sparing police thousands of hours.
<P>Other government agencies have already jumped on the
electronic identification bandwagon, and many state social
services departments, including those in New York, New Jersey and
Connecticut, have such systems for identifying welfare
recipients. (To date, for instance, New York's Suffolk County has
documented saving more than $1 million, mostly by blocking false
claims.)
<P>The technology works by photographing the swirls and whorls
of each fingertip. A computer tabulates and records the locations
of specific ridges, indentations and patterns known to be unique
to each person. Identix reports that its scanning equipment is
nearly 100 percent effective in matching the right person with
the right fingerprint-but the computer has also rejected a
correct match 3 percent of the time. (The chance of any two
people having the identical fingerprint is estimated to be less
than one in a billion.) If the technology keeps reaching wider
and wider audiences, you, too, may soon be asked for your hand.

<CENTER><H2>ONE SMALL STEP</H2>
The next big advance in chip<BR>design arrives one year early</CENTER>
<P>With grand fanfare, the electronics giant Texas Instruments
announced in May that it had perfected a process that can produce
silicon microchips of far greater detail and complexity than any
currently available. Newspapers widely marveled at the
innovation; many pointed out that TI is the first to produce chips
with features as small as 0.18 micron (millionths of a meter)
wide. Some predicted that the microchips would launch a
generation of wonderfully smart and compact contraptions.
<P>Such reports were wrong on two counts, but correct on the third.
TI was not first. Although that company has prototypes on hand and
hopes to have a factory constructed by next year, IBM began
shipping small quantities of equally detailed integrated circuits
in May. And both TI's and IBM's processes create tiny transistors
that are 0.25, not 0.18, micron in width. (The much misunderstood
0.18-micron measurement refers not to feature size but to the
distance current must travel to switch a single transistor.) This
long-expected advance is the logical next step beyond the
0.35-micron features that make up the Pentium Pro and PowerPC
chips now on the market, but it was not anticipated to occur
until 1997.
<P>Hyperbole aside, the new semiconductors may indeed have a
dramatic impact on computers over the next five years or so, for
several reasons. First is power consumption. TI claims its
devices run on as little as one volt-about one third the voltage
required by Intel's Pentium. Such low-power chips could
significantly extend battery life in portable gadgets. The
second benefit is sheer size. 
<P>Whereas a Pentium Pro today spreads about 3.3 million transistors
across four layers, the new processes draw smaller switches onto
six layers, with even more layers to come in the near future. All
told, TI estimates it can turn out chips with up to 125 million
switches, a number that was expected to be beyond reach until
about 2005, based on historical trends. Whether it can do so
without also charging 10 times more for its chips than Intel does
for the Pentium Pro remains to be seen.
<P>Greater breadth and depth lead directly to the final advantage:
speed. Smaller transistors always switch faster, but the real
boost will come from combining into a single chip functions that
previously required several processors. "A lot of speed is lost
when you have to move signals between chips," observes G. Dan
Hutcheson, an industry consultant at VLSI Research. In
particular, he suggests, chip designers will want to combine
memory with logic circuits in ways they never could before.
<P>For all its promise, the advance also represents a threat to the
computer industry. "As we push below 0.25 micron, the software
tools available to design integrated circuits are not going to be
able to keep up with the added complexity," Hutcheson warns. If
manufacturers have to add dozens of engineers to produce each new
design, chips will not remain cheap-and fast-evolving-for long.
To head off what it calls a "productivity gap," the industry
consortium SEMATECH awarded a multimillion-dollar contract to Synopsys in May
for an advanced design system that can handle circuits of 0.25
micron and the next two or three smaller increments. Beyond that
lie limits that will force chipmakers to look for great
technological leaps rather than small, safe steps. [See

Dan Hutcheson and Jerry D. Hutcheson; Scientific American,

<CENTER><H2>COAT OF MANY COLORS</H2></CENTER>
<P>Conventional wisdom has it that red cars attract more speeding
tickets. But what about cars that change color? Several new
coatings may soon permit drivers to test their legal luck. 
<P>Taking cues from nature, chemists have been able to develop
paints that derive their colors from interference patterns. The
brilliant colors of butterflies, for example, result from
multiple layers of extraordinarily thin fibers found in the
insects' wings. When light falls on the wings, the top layers
reflect the rays at a slightly different angle than the bottom
layers do. The different reflected wavelengths then interfere
with one another, producing new wavelengths that appear as
shimmering colors.
<P>The use of such coatings has been limited to small objects,
until now. Several companies have recently described their
efforts to create car paint based on this principle. Researchers
at Nissan and the Tokyo Institute of Technology spun tiny strands
of polyester that gave rise to interference patterns-and the
iridescent blue seen in certain butterflies. Mercedes-Benz is
offering European customers paint that changes color depending on
one's viewing point: light reflects off layers of liquid-crystal
polymers at different angles, producing various colors. And Ford
offers a limited-run 1996 Mustang with paint that can appear
green, purple, gold or amber.
<P>Not surprisingly, these unusual paint jobs remain a luxury
option: Mercedes charges 10,000 deutsche marks (that's
U.S.$6,600) for the customized work. The vacuum technology that
is needed to produce the paint is very expensive, and the
coatings themselves can be difficult to handle because the
microstructures that produce the colorful interference patterns
can break, particularly in the application process. No word yet
on how well they tolerate fender benders.

<CENTER><H2>SHELLEY A. HARRISON</H2>
<P>Exploring the Business of Space</CENTER>
<P>The curving tower of yellow smoke that just lofted
<I>Endeavour</I> into the morning sky over Cape Canaveral on
Florida's east coast is beginning to disperse, and Shelley A.
Harrison, whose company has entrusted much of its assets to the
space shuttle's cargo bay, is beaming. Although he missed a
night's sleep schmoozing and talking business, Harrison,
chairman and CEO of <A HREF="http://hvsun4.mdc.com:1025/SPACEHAB/SPACEHAB.html">Spacehab</A>, exudes confidence. The commercial
space business is poised to take off, he believes, and Spacehab
has-for now-no competition. "I believe human habitation of space
is going to happen, and Spacehab's objective is to support it,"
Harrison declares.
<P>Harrison, possibly the only person at the Kennedy Space Center
wearing a suit and tie, is a high-tech venture capitalist with a
mission to commercialize the space frontier. His voice is
academic-precise, rather than big-business-brash, harking back to
his days as a university scientist. But Harrison has the kind of
record that commands attention in the world of commerce: one of
his early ventures helped to establish the bar codes that now
adorn products throughout the developed world. Harrison thinks
low earth orbit is a territory as ripe for technological
development as the retail stores of the 1970s.
<P>Although few companies to date have invested much effort in
space-based research-and almost none are contemplating
manufacturing in space-Harrison believes that will change. As he
sees it, opportunities to put payloads in orbit on the shuttle
have been too infrequent for most businesses to evaluate the idea
seriously. Spacehab aims to jump-start orbital industry by
providing customers with room in laboratory modules that fit in
the shuttle's cargo bay. The company, which leases space on
shuttles from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration,
has won a contract to carry supplies for the Russian <I>Mir</I>
space station into orbit. Harrison has an even more ambitious
long-term target: privatizing operations on the planned
International Space Station.
<P>Harrison's parents, who named him after the poet, hoped he
would become a rabbi. He studied the Talmud and says the logic
and argumentation taught him "to think on multiple levels." But
it was the post-Sputnik era, and so after a year studying physics
in Israel, Harrison decided to accept a NASA scholarship that
enabled him to earn a bachelor's degree in electrical
engineering. He went on to work on military phased-array radars
at AT&AMP;T Bell Laboratories. 
<P>While working in the 1960s toward a doctorate at Brooklyn
Polytechnic (now Polytechnic University), Harrison had the
opportunity to observe at close quarters the firm Quantronix,
which was struggling, without much success, to develop lasers
for exotic applications. The experience taught him an important
lesson about business. "I realized that were I ever to do that-go
and form a company that might involve lasers-I'd look for a very
pervasive, wide market application, not little niche markets."
<P>Ph.D. in hand, Harrison became a professor at the State
University of New York at Stony Brook, where he was in charge of
developing the quantum electronics curriculum. He learned the art
of grantsmanship and also formed a nonprofit concern, Public
Systems Research, to allow students and faculty to supplement
their incomes through consulting. Among the clients were NASA,
which was designing combustion experiments for the Skylab
missions fiown in the 1970s, and the Universal Product Code
Council, an organization that was seeking a machine-readable way
to represent product information.
<P>By the early 1970s, supermarket clerks were entering an
increasing amount of data into machines, but they were still
doing it by hand and thus making many errors. Lasers, Harrison
realized, could provide "eyes for the computer" in an automated
system. He teamed up with Jerome Swartz to establish Symbol
Technologies and then to "conquer the world," as Harrison puts
it.
<P>Symbol's goal was to develop portable laser bar-code
scanners, but first there had to be bar codes to scan. Harrison
and Swartz, joined later by Harrison's wife, Susanne, started
(in, yes, a garage) using a computer-driven device to print bar
codes onto film and incorporating the result into product
packaging. Symbol introduced a handheld laser scanner attached to
a fixed station that printers and packagers could use to check the
readability of bar codes.
<P>Symbol then automated the magazine-returns industry with an
expanded code that made issue dates machine readable, and the
inventors later perfected more portable "gun scanners" that have
since invaded record and bookstores and even department stores.
(They avoided supermarket checkout desks, Harrison explains,
because it became clear that cash-register manufacturers were
better positioned to corner that market.)
<P>Symbol made investors "a ton of money" after it went public in
1979, Harrison says. But he quickly realized he was more
interested in blazing new high-technology trails than managing a
fast-growing company. In 1982 he and Susanne formed their own
venture-capital business, Harrison Enterprises. In the late
1980s, together with Herman Fialkov and others, Harrison created
Poly Ventures, which raised $53 million to invest in start-up
semiconductor, laser and software companies, several of which
are now publicly traded. (Under a profit-sharing arrangement, $1.5
million of his profits to date have gone to his alma mater,
Polytechnic University.)
<P>Meanwhile Harrison had formed a close relationship with Robert
Citron, a "visionary, explorer type" who had been an
international projects administrator at the Smithsonian
Institution and then went on to found Spacehab. Citron asked
Harrison to help him boldly go where no business had gone
before. Citron's original vision of space tourism on the shuttle
soon evolved into a plan to provide laboratory space. Whereas
most aerospace companies content themselves with bidding for
government contracts to supply hardware, Spacehab was founded on
the principle that it would own its hardware and lease to the
government.
<P>Because NASA officials originally envisioned the shuttle as
merely a vehicle for carrying cargo to a space station, it had
little room for experiments. But when it became clear the station
would be long delayed, Harrison and Citron began playing with the
notion of doing research on laboratory modules in the capacious
cargo bay. Astronauts could gain access to a module through a
tunnel connected to the shuttle's mid-deck. Citron reckoned that
by avoiding unnecessary bureaucracy, a private company could
provide modules for less money than NASA could.
<P>Harrison raised the idea with aerospace executives, who
approved of the concept but declined to invest. In 1987 Citron
convinced Harrison, who had already put some of his own money in
Spacehab and had a seat on the board, to devote himself to
raising capital. It was by now clear that the first three
laboratory modules-the minimum number worth building-would cost
more than $120 million. Harrison found believers in Europe, where
Daimler-Benz and Alenia Spazio are investors, and in the Far
East, where Mitsubishi, wealthy investors in Taiwan and the
government of Singapore's venture arm have sizable stakes.
<P>But the entrepreneur was still short of the target when a
NASA-commissioned study concluded that the agency would have to
spend $1.2 billion to build fiight hardware with the capabilities
that Spacehab was offering for $185 million. Spacehab got the
contract, bridged the capital gap and started building. Harrison
became chairman in 1993, the same year as Spacehab's first
fiight. <I>Endeavour</I>'s mission this past May was the fourth
for a Spacehab laboratory module and the fifth for the company
(a storage module carried supplies to <I>Mir</I> earlier this
year).
<P>Spacehab has increased annual profits since its initial
fiight, although it is still showing a cumulative loss since its
inception. But if Harrison's vision is borne out-and if the U.S.
keeps the shuttle fieet in service-the company could reap large
returns. Harrison is now negotiating places for Spacehab modules
on NASA's existing space shuttle manifest. A little shuffiing
around of payloads in the shuttle, he maintains, can free up room
that can be sold to companies as well as NASA's partners in the
International Space Station for testing station equipment.
Spacehab has recently introduced a new double module that extends
the possibilities, he points out.
<P>Harrison's two children seem to have acquired from their
father an enthusiasm for technology. Rachel is a systems engineer
and artist who is now developing interactive multimedia, and
Daniel is training to be an electrical engineer. The senior
Harrison scorns those academic scientists who sneer at
space-based research but have never put money at risk. "If I'd
listened to all the naysayers about the prospects for turning
technology into profit with respect to my ventures, I wouldn't
have done any of them," he grumbles. He trusts his "gut" to sense
opportunities.
<P>Harrison maintains that although commercial space research has
been conducted sporadically in the past decade, it got under way
"in earnest" only with Spacehab's first fiight. So it is
impressive, he argues, that in 1995 industry and academia put up
$38 million in cash and "in-kind contributions"-which include
materials-for commercial space research. NASA put up about half
that amount and provided free launches, but Harrison defends the
subsidy as appropriate for a fiedgling industry.
<P>He sees grounds for optimism in the 100 companies on the books
as commercial space affiliates of NASA as well as the five new
space-related patents granted and 11 filed in 1995. "The
commercial microgravity research conducted to date clearly has
demonstrated that there is value," he states, noting its
"iterative nature." He points to Kennametal, an industrial tool
manufacturer that has fiown four experiments on Spacehab modules
to learn more about liquid-phase sintering of alloys, as well as
the orbital activities of some pharmaceutical companies that may
lead to new drugs. Where many observers find fragmentary results
and tepid interest, Harrison sees the start of a trend.
<P>Harrison's hunch is that industry will embrace experiments in
space-and possibly even manufacturing-when it can negotiate with
a commercial partner and be sure that standardized orbital
facilities will be available. "The way things work now, is it
viable to carry out commercial activity and research in space for
some benefit on the earth? Hardly likely," he concedes. Now the
venture capitalist is warming to his subject, and he raises his
voice just a little. "Is it evolving into something better? Yes,
and I think Spacehab is doing it. Can it be good and worthwhile?
Yes. We believe it, or we wouldn't be putting our money and the
company on the line to develop it." -<I>Tim Beardsley at Cape Canaveral</I>
