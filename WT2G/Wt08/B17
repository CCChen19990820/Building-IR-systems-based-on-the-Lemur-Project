<H3>''Education, information and communication strategies in the
drugs sphere''</H3>

<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P>
Developments in the presentday world are moving inexorably towards
the internationalisation of the production, trading and distribution
of a growing number of consumer goods and services.  This fact,
the result of progress in the industrial, transport and communications
fields, has led to the exponential growth in the quantity and
variety of products available to a now worldwide consumer population.
<P>
The international expansion of production and trade obeys no rules
other than those of supply and demand.  This applies as much to
the production of foodstuffs, arms, cultural products, garments
and electronic equipment as to that of drugs.  So geographical
regions and populations completely unfamiliar with certain products
are now being attracted to these new markets, which are becoming
part of their consumption patterns.
<P>
Tribal warfare and local disputes in Africa, Asia and Latin America,
until recently conducted with axes, knives and ancient firearms,
are now efficiently resolved using Kalashnikovs, antipersonnel
mines and shells fired from long range.  In many remote corners
of the planet, illnesses to which traditional medicine and medicaments
were once applied are starting to be treated through modern pharmacy
and medicine.  It would take too long to list the changes under
way in everyday human life, but it would be enough to say that
not only consumer goods and services are affected, but also other
more profound and more complex manifestations of the human being,
such as religious beliefs and practices.
<P>
It is against this background of farreaching change and universalisation
of ways and customs that we have to consider the invasion of our
societies by drugs.  While the developed countries flood the planet
with their highperformance, efficient industrial products, the
disappearance of borders and reduction of distances bring us into
contact with often mysterious and exotic products from elsewhere,
used as perfect instruments for escape.
<P>
As these products are not part of its culture, the western world
lacks the knowhow applied to their use in their places of origin.
 Most of them being prohibited products, they are never marketed
with a &quot;dosage&quot; or &quot;instructions for use&quot;,
unless &quot;word of mouth&quot; gives some guidance rendered
more obscure by its clandestine nature.  A current trend accompanying
the growth in consumer goods is also linked to the appearance
of drugs in our daytoday lives.  Psychologists report sustained
and constant efforts to find a way of overcoming the pitfalls
of ordinary life.  Our contemporaries are less and less willing
to put up with the constraints of illness, pain, old age, distance,
loneliness and boredom.  They think they have found the solution
to every one of these problems, a response all the more effective
for being rapid, complete and absolute.  Psychotropic drugs are
at the fore in this context.
<P>
These developments have led to some concepts being superseded
by others more appropriate to the way in which the world is now
structured.  Citizens now tend to identify with consumer's participation
with consumption, and development with integration into the market.
 Communication, information and - very much so - the failings
of education have played a leading role in this conceptual change
and in these new social practices.
<H3>Current education, information and communication policies
</H3>

<P>
We shall first analyse these three fields, from the general to
the specific.
<P>
<I>Communication:</I> this encompasses every method of transmitting
a message and all the forms it can take: written, oral, audiovisual,
and so on.  It also covers the various approaches used, involving
advertising, teaching, entertainment, etc.  Communication about
drugs problems is part of this, so it is subject to the same rules
as those which govern communication about other aspect of life
in society.  Before turning our attention to communication in
relation to drugs and drug addiction, we shall describe the three
main features of communication in general at the moment: proliferation,
nonspecificity and lack of originality.
<P>
<I>Proliferation:</I> the numbers of messages for &quot;communication&quot;
are proliferating to an extraordinary extent.  This expansion
on every front leads to unstructured jumbles of information, resulting
in confused and garbled messages.  This just makes it more difficult
for an uninitiated audience to understand.  The introduction of
thematic channels might go some way to resolving this problem.
 However, it might well give rise to &quot;elitist&quot; communication
and leave the population groups in greatest need even more cut
off from information.
<P>
<I>Non-specificity:</I> one of the consequences of communication's
role in consumption is that the message is put across to the general
public.  This has at least two consequences.  One is that the
signal given does not go exclusively to its target, leading to
&quot;undesirable&quot; sideeffects.  The best example of this
is films showing violence or sex, which &quot;nonspecific&quot;
transmission makes available to children.  The second is that
the message, often tinged with &quot;consumerism&quot;, reaches
a broader audience than that with access to consumption.  Frustration
and marginalisation may ensue.
<P>
<I>Lack of originality:</I> there being no hierarchical structure
in modern communication, some of the messages deserving particular
treatment and methods lack originality.
<P>
The above three elements only make communication about such a
complex and new problem as that of drugs and drug addiction more
opaque.  Dangerous inefficacity is the inevitable result of the
disorderly and unstructured accumulation typical of this kind
of communication, coupled with a lack of clarity about targets
and a lack of originality in the message.
<P>
<I>Information:</I> this is more than communication, but a message
intended to be received by someone who thereby obtains a certain
amount of data.  This is already an area where there is more of
a target, and of which more direct use may be made for preventive
purposes.  It is nevertheless the case that information on the
subject of interest to us is extremely polarised and fragmentary.
 After studying the information about drugs provided by a good
number of Spanish media, a journalist called Milagro P&eacute;rez
Oliva, who works on the daily &quot;El Pa&iacute;s&quot;, states
that the information given by the media is processed in a way
which corrupts and distorts it.  This is said to happen in three
stages: simplification, homogenisation and generalisation.  The
end result after all three is an extremely inaccurate and tendentious
vision of the problem.  In P&eacute;rez Oliva's view, there are
two reasons for this: the fact that virtually all information
about drugs comes from police sources and the almost irreversible
tendency of &quot;information providers&quot; to regard drugs
issues as purely a matter of crimes or offences.  From this ensues
the advice that a &quot;media moratorium&quot; be adopted in this
field, enabling the conditions for fair and objective reporting
to be restored.
<P>
Noray and Parvex [addressing a seminar on drugs and the mass media
in Vitoria, Spain, in 1993] added a third factor to those mentioned
by P&eacute;rez Oliva.  These are the economic constraints and
requirements to which the media are subjected.  The simplification,
homogenisation and generalisation of drugs information, together
with the police sources and processing thereof, combine to give
a response which matches current trends in the information market
perfectly.  That market is subject to advertisers' dictates and
to the profitability constraints imposed by those in the media
who bear financial responsibility.  Apart from a simplified, not
to say simplistic, reading and a Manichaean treatment of events
with a view to high audience figures, large numbers of readers
and consequently profits from advertising, there is no hope for
information.  In the circumstances, there is no hope for information
intended to educate and raise awareness.
<P>
<I>Education:</I> this means not just informing, but putting information
across on a specific subject with a view to educating a selected
audience and giving it what it needs.  It always involves teaching
with a view to providing a public service.  Drugs and drug prevention
are problems which have been covered by large numbers of educational
efforts, from long-term health education campaigns to more specific
activities intended to prevent drug addiction.  With very few
exceptions, the main weapons so far used in such educational activities
have been fear, the moral aspect and health.  Fear and morality
created a real &quot;educational vacuum&quot;, preventing the
target audience (young people, atrisk groups, etc) from gaining
genuine knowledge of what is involved.  The drug situation was
shown to be independent of our own responsibility, like another
plague visited upon Egypt, bearing more resemblance to a divine
curse than to human behaviour.  This vision gave rise to <U>two
major failings in the educational effort</U>: on the one hand,
drugs seemed to be endowed with a life of their own, making them
unmanageable and quite out of human control; on the other, a stigma
was attached to drug addicts, as if they should be banished from
society.  The resulting impotence and discrimination merely make
the prevention of drug addiction even more difficult.  Good health
advocates abstinence, although it is known that people at risk,
who ought to be the main target of preventive action (weak persons,
drug addicts suffering from illnesses, etc) by definition have
little or no psychological capacity to resist.  If the health
argument were to have any degree of success, this would be vis&agrave;vis
individuals with little inclination to dependency, and certainly
not those who are susceptible.  It is a rather like taking coals
to Newcastle...
<H3>Alternative education policies and recommendations</H3>

<P>
Sensible education about the origins and history of drugs would
make the problem understandable in its historical context, consistent
with the development of our society.  Drugs and drug addiction
must finally be included as aspects of our real world and accepted
as a new part of our culture.  If they are no longer treated as
alien to our civilisation, the ills afflicting us become understandable.
 I shall now highlight a few of the practical ideas we hope to
contribute to the debate:
<UL>
<LI>efforts to dissociate from any ideology both health education
and drugs prevention.  It is a prerequisite that drugs be accepted
as part of our society.  Only by adopting this attitude can there
be ongoing preventive action, rather than temporary, oneoff activities;
<LI>elimination of the demon element so that drugs are treated
as inert and controllable, rather than as something with a life
of its own exempt from the general rules of society.  A prerequisite
is a demonstration and knowledge of every aspect.  This kind of
objective and scientific effort to spread the word should cover
themes such as original raw materials (synthetic or plantderived),
chemical formulae, means of action, pharmaceutical uses, beneficial
uses, risks and contraindications, the context in which they are
produced, manufactured and trafficked, and so on;
<LI>inclusion of such educational activities on official syllabuses
(primary and secondary schools, universities, military academies,
etc);
<LI>publicity for the views of (present or former) victims of
drugs, thereby restoring their citizenship and showing that the
problem is not just one which affects ''other people&quot;;
<LI>obtaining of funds, assistance and support from states and
international institutions for all educational activities (magazines,
films, publications, awareness campaigns, etc) in line with the
principles set out above.

<H3>Can the media take part in prevention?</H3>

<P>
The media are regularly the target of accusations by those dealing
with drug addicts: &quot;they only speak of the punitive aspects&quot;;
&quot;drug addicts are always shown as human wrecks&quot;; &quot;they
always aim for sensationalism&quot;, etc.  To that we should add:
&quot;What can be done so that the media can take part in prevention?&quot;.
<P>
Is this the right question?  Because the media can, to a certain
extent, put pressure on both the public and the authorities, should
they be seen as having to answer to the public, like an elected
representative or a government department.
<P>
The media have no vocation to look after public health or carry
out preventive measures.  Newspapers and magazines are seen, in
simplified terms, as companies doing business by selling news.
 As a result, their survival depends heavily on sales of advertising
space and maintaining a steady readership.  Certain magazines
have no aim other than to make a profit, deliberately focusing
on very specialised markets and exploiting the seedier aspects
of life (violence, sex, gossip, etc).
<P>
As for those famous press ethics, a media safety net, in every
country we have regular evidence that this hardly does anything
to prevent the media sliding into biased information, manipulation,
put-up jobs, etc.
<P>
Should we therefore give up any hope of conveying prevention messages
in the press?  No.  The modern media are formidable mouthpieces
but they are not - at least the mass media - the natural allies
of those who are involved in the field of drugs and drug addiction.
 At most, they are tools or go-betweens and the way to use them
optimally, with all their limitations, must be learnt.
<P>
Also there are media and media.  Television is a visual medium
and therefore ephemeral by nature, incurring considerable risks
but with a major potential for fascination.  Generally speaking,
the public have only limited confidence in it; the radio, the
immediate news medium par excellence, is able to deliver messages
to a very big audience; the press, more in the background, is
weighed down by the fact that it is printed, in our societies
where people swear by the written word.  But public confidence
in the press has been seriously eroded in recent years.
<P>
The media with the biggest audience - and therefore of greatest
interest if we are to convey prevention messages to the most people
- are often the least accessible for this type of exercise: the
bigger the audience, the vaguer and more slender the expectations
and the greater the risk of the audience growing tired of a prevention
campaign, rarely very entertaining, it has to be said, especially
in the case of drugs and drug addiction.
<P>
Furthermore, a prevention message, almost by definition, must
be repeated endlessly if it is to strike home.  Yet, short of
regularly buying pages of advertisements, it is out of the question
for the media to keep coming back to a given subject, however
interesting that subject might be.  News - this is a dogma of
journalism - is necessarily ephemeral and constantly changing.
<H3>Do the media manipulate information and messages?</H3>

<P>
We are all tempted to believe so.  Trick images, sound bites quoted
out of context and provocative articles are not rarities.  Yet,
deliberate malpractices aside, we are sometimes faced with a more
insidious situation: involuntary manipulation by the media.
<P>
Since they tend to meet the expectations of their readers in the
choice of subjects covered or in the way of presenting events,
the media may often be tempted to reproduce conventional or simplistic
rhetoric.  By adopting the prevailing arguments, and elaborating
on them, without detachment, they themselves help to form public
opinion, which then supports the prevailing arguments, which are
taken up again by the media, and so forth.  This leads to a kind
of media &quot;Larsen effect&quot;.
<P>
In turn, we may ask the question: do the media reflect public
opinion or do they help to create it?  Researchers have analysed
the way in which the subject of immigration was presented in 1993
in a daily newspaper published in south-western France.  They
discovered that it was frequently linked to other issues - petty
crime, violence, drugs and drug addiction.  Nothing overtly scandalous,
but an obsessive and regular correlation, working on public opinion
covertly. 
<P>
In an area as full of pitfalls as that of drugs and drug addiction,
this risk is permanent: whether consciously or not, an Algerian
selling cannabis with his uncles and brothers will tend to be
referred to as &quot;the head of an <U>Algerian</U> drug ring&quot;
(whereas a Frenchman in this situation would be referred to as
&quot;the head of a family drug ring&quot;).  Whether consciously
or not, drug addicts tend to be presented in terms of their failing
rather than as human beings worthy of respect, etc.
<P>
On the other hand, the media themselves may be manipulated.  The
fictitious mass graves of Timisoara in Romania or coverage of
the Gulf War are spectacular and disturbing examples.
<P>
This is a result, in particular, of the balancing act imposed
by working methods where urgency dominates but also of the choice
of information sources.  In the field of drugs (in France, in
any case), there are two main sources: the &quot;punitive&quot;
side, the police (along with customs and the courts); and the
&quot;treatment&quot; side, bodies dispensing health care.  For
the media the former source is often the more &quot;attractive&quot;:
it offers opportunities to witness spectacular operations (shadowing
suspects, arrests, seizures, etc) whereas health organisations
are shy of excessive publicity and prefer to work more discreetly.
<P>
It should, therefore, come as no surprise that certain media convey
a biased image of the phenomenon of drugs and drug addiction.
<H3>Is it possible to work with the media? </H3>

<P>
In France, the &quot;Grande Ecoute&quot; association has forged
working links with magazines and radio and television programmes
in order to have articles printed or to work jointly on regular
features.  They mainly work with magazines about the family or
problems facing society, by nature more open to prevention issues.
 Not only drugs are dealt with but wider-ranging issues, connected
with the search for well-being or difficulties facing young people:
How to be an adult.   Why do people commit suicide? etc.
<P>
The much maligned popular television channels do dare however,
albeit only from time to time, to undertake prevention operations.
 In France, for example, the yearly &quot;Sidathon&quot; (AIDS
Telethon) is now becoming a regular television event.
<P>
Apart, of course, from buying advertising space, it may therefore
be possible to work together with the media in the field of prevention.
 Generally speaking, success depends on having a good understanding
of how they work, what their interests are and what constraints
are put upon them.  First of all, they must be considered as partners
and not just recording studios, expected unquestioningly to pass
on the messages delivered to them. 
<H3>Some ideas:</H3>

<UL>
<LI><U>Learning to communicate with the media</U>: how to draft
a good press release, how to present our actions to turn them
into &quot;events&quot; attractive to journalists.  This does
not mean adapting chameleon-like to the demands of the press,
but bringing out the strong points of our activities, highlighting
them, clarifying presentation documents, using clear and direct
language, etc.  Far too often those involved in drug addiction
complain that &quot;the press did not turn up&quot;, even though
nothing had been done to attract it: no press kit, clumsy invitations,
a reluctance to communicate, etc.  As if, amid the mass of news
bombarding it every day, the &quot;press&quot; in question should
have guessed for itself the interest of a particular prevention
activity!
<LI><U>Training journalists</U>, regularly inviting them to seminars,
conferences or working groups. We must learn to see journalists
covering these subjects as &quot;drug/drug addiction&quot; workers
in their own right.
<LI><U>Setting up our own media</U>: very few media cover these
issues, yet the need for basic information is great.  It is interesting
to note that the most evangelistic groups, such as the Patriarch
Community, have their own magazines to publicise their ideas.
 The San Patrignano community, in Italy, publishes a superb monthly
colour magazine, produced to a fully professional standard.
</UL>

<H3>Magazines specialising in information about drugs</H3>

<P>
In 1990, we started up &quot;INTERDEPENDANCES&quot;, a news magazine
about drugs and drug addiction, in order to fill a yawning information
gap, make up for the lack of public awareness and instigate a
responsible debate in this area.  It is a <U>news</U> medium rather
than an <U>opinion</U> medium, because we feel this is what the
public needs most, in an area so full of partisan position-taking.
 The magazine offers balanced information, calling on the public
to accept its responsibilities vis-&agrave;-vis drugs: so that
everyone - as a parent, adolescent, citizen, drug-user, etc -
can have a better understanding of the risks for society and individuals,
going beyond simplistic views, so that they are better equipped
to tackle the issue.
<P>
Early on, the &quot;INTERDEPENDANCES&quot; magazine contemplated
the idea of taking on a European and international dimension.
In 1992, &quot;INTERDEPENDENCIAS&quot;, its Spanish cousin, saw
light of day, with the same basic aims.  In 1995 the first issue
of &quot;INTERDEPENDENZEN&quot;, the German-language version,
came out and three thematic issues of &quot;INTERDEPENDENCES&quot;
have been published in English since 1992.
<P>
Broadly speaking, we are set on showing that drug and drug-addiction
phenomena are complex: they must involve a number of professions
(health, justice, economics, police, education, research, finance,
etc) which must learn to work together in order to come up with
healthier approaches than mere punishment, which has easily shown
its limits, or simple liberalism, whose abuse would lead (if it
were tried out) to similar excesses.  They take a particular interest
in the alternatives to repressive policies being carried out in
Europe, as well as in the Third World or anywhere else.
<P>
For this phenomenon is not only complex, it is also global.  We
have detected several forms of interdependences, linking the individual
to society (the drug addict to anti-drug policies), the globe
to the neighbourhood (from production and trafficking to street-corner
deals).  No social category is safe, no country is exempt.  On
this final point, our various publications emphasise, in particular,
one aspect which tends to be forgotten, ie North-South relations.
 Drugs are a powerful reminder of the flaws in the world economy.

The need for up-to-date information on the political, economic
and ecological aspects of drug production
<H3><A HREF="#bianco">Lucia BIANCO - Italy </A> </CENTER></H3>

<H3><A NAME="theme3"></A>Contribution by Lucia BIANCO - Italy
</H3>

<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P>
In theory, at least, the connection should by now be established
between activities linked to the production of, and illicit trafficking
in, drugs and economic, political, social, cultural and ecological
environmental factors concerning the relationship between rich
and poor countries, between North and South.  But this has not
been translated into practical policy or other measures.  Only
a comprehensive approach to the problem of the production, trafficking,
use and abuse of drugs, which also takes into account the relationship
between North and South and global prospects for economic, social
and cultural development, can lead to positive results - whereas
the sectoral and almost exclusively punitive policies pursued
so far are only making the problem worse.
<P>
From this point of view, the dissemination of reliable, rapid
and constantly updated information on the subject is of the utmost
importance, so that increasingly global, integrated strategies
may be adopted for combatting illicit drugs at the following levels:

<UL>
<LI>policy-makers and officials;
<LI>technicians and specialists in the sector;
<LI>the grassroots.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
In order to achieve this aim, it is essential to tackle a number
of fundamental problems:
<P>
1. First of all, it must be acknowledged that scientific data,
relating to illicit drugs and traditional indicators of their
production, trafficking and use, are vital but not sufficient
for understanding all of the problems linked to drugs, both in
producer countries and in consumer countries - even though producer
countries are consuming more and consumer countries are producing
more, especially the synthetic drugs now invading international
markets.
<P>
2. Secondly, it must be established how, in the framework of media
strategies, it is possible to obtain a global and broad view of
the problem, that can bring out the inter-connection between the
production of illicit drugs, economic and social development policies
(in both producer and consumer countries), environment protection
policies, the cultural and anthropological aspects of the use
of such substances, the rights of minorities, the strategies of
criminal organisations and the mafia and, last but not least,
the machinery for laundering money earned through drug trafficking.
 For this purpose, the quantitative data available are highly
reductive and susceptible to manipulation, and must necessarily
be assessed along with qualitative data.  For example, when assessing
the ecological impact of coca cultivation in Andean countries,
it is not enough to consider only the area used to grow coca;
this quantifiable fact must also be put into perspective with
qualitative data: the regions where it is grown, the people growing
it, the means they use, etc.
<P>
3. It must also be established how accurate, correct and reliable
information may be obtained on goods illegally produced for illicit
markets and consumption, for example those drugs considered as
illegal by the 1988 United Nations Convention against Illicit
Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances; which information
sources may be considered reliable in this field: the governments
of producer countries, those of consumer countries, international
organisations (United Nations, WHO, UNESCO, etc), the police,
NGOs, specialised research and study centres, journalists, etc;
and who, and on the basis of which criteria, should select, monitor
and establish the reliability of those sources.
<P>
4. It must also be decided who may have access to this information
and how the information may be disseminated, not only among policy
makers or police forces but also among the grass roots who, in
this way, can be involved in monitoring the strategies implemented
by governments and international organisations to combat the misuse
of legal and illegal drugs - covering not only the stamping out
of narcotics trafficking, prevention and the social rehabilitation
of those involved but also development alternatives in producer
countries.
<P>
5. Finally, ways must be found of keeping open as many information
sources as possible while making them comparable, since data are
often collected in accordance with the aims of the organisations
doing the collecting and the analyses carried out are often founded
on preconceptions or partial data instead of being based on a
scientific research method.  The more approaches there are to
the problem, the broader the vision, the less the bias and the
smaller the risk of an ideological assessment of these phenomena.
<H3>Strategies implemented nationally and internationally</H3>

<P>
Although our list is by no means exhaustive, we shall be outlining
certain strategies and initiatives for the collection, comparison
and exchange of information used so far at various levels.  In
any case, it must first be stated that, despite the national European
and worldwide projects launched, the statistics available to date
have not been homogenous, have often been gathered according to
criteria which render comparison impossible, are often not scientifically
reliable and are difficult to come by.  In many cases, they have
proved limited, as they are essentially based on quantitative
rather than qualitative information.
<P>
At the same time, the data that are available concern, above all,
the phenomenon that we might define as &quot;the tip of the iceberg&quot;,
in other words the number of arrests and convictions for the production,
trafficking and sale of illicit drugs, the quantity of substances
confiscated by the police, not forgetting drug addicts being treated
by public or private bodies and statistics on deaths from drugs
overdoses.  On the other hand, when it comes to what might be
described as the &quot;submerged part of the iceberg&quot;, in
other words, the amount of land cultivated for the production
of illicit drugs, the economic dimensions of the market and trafficking
in narcotics and the overall scale of drug use, we only have estimates,
of varying reliability, or data which are often contradictory.
<P>
We often find a great lack of homogeneity between data from official
sources (governments, police forces, international organisations)
and data gathered by specialists in the sector, special centres,
NGOs and the grass roots.
<P>
In fact, there is virtually no pooling of or complementarity between
the various types of data which might help to build up a complete
picture of the phenomenon, ie:
<UL>
<LI>specific quantitative indicators relating to the &quot;tip
of the iceberg&quot;;
<LI>contextual or qualitative data: information on social, political,
economic, cultural and environmental variables conditioning developments
in the production, trafficking and use of illicit drugs in different
parts of the world;
<LI>data concerning localised operations conducted by the grass
roots and NGOs, facilitating a more qualitative approach based
on the actual experience and perceptions that local organisations,
&quot;producers&quot;, &quot;consumers&quot;, etc may have of
the problem.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
But, as mentioned before, experiments and attempts at liaison
or the comparison, continuous updating and dissemination of information
are being carried out at various levels.  An important example
is undoubtedly the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug
Addiction (EMCDDA), through the activation both of national networks
of special centres by &quot;focal points&quot; and of the European
REITOX network, which are due to be linked up with other international
bodies dealing with this subject: UNDCP, WHO, Pompidou Group,
CCC, EUROPOL and INTERPOL.  There are also other information exchange
systems dealing with the prevention of drug trafficking, such
as Teledrug, Dosis, Interpol, Europol and others, all accessible
to the police forces of the countries linked to them.
<P>
The United Nations, on the other hand, publishes yearly Human
Development Reports compares and contrasts social, political and
economic data as well as information on the respect of rights,
in order to determine the level of human development in various
countries in the world.
<P>
Among NGOs, in the North and South alike, several gather data,
focusing on their activities in the sector - the Northern and
Southern countries where they work - and there have been experiments
in their liaison aimed at a continuous exchange of data, nationally
or at European or international level, such as the European Committee
of Drugs and Development NGOs, the network of NGOs which took
part in the European Information Campaign &quot;Coca 95&quot;,
the Geopolitical Drugs Observatory, Acci&oacute;n Andina, NGO
Committees (including the NGOs recognised by the United Nations)
etc.  Alongside them, UNESCO, thanks to dissemination of the ISIS
data gathering programme, has offered an efficient instrument
for collecting and exchanging information: through it, information
exchange networks have already been established, mainly for exchanges
between NGOs.
<P>
Another reality which must be taken into account is that of the
information already available on INTERNET:
<UL>
<LI>a number of activists involved in the reform of drug policies
are linked up to information about their own organisations and
activities (the Cannabis Action Network, the Multidisciplinary
Association for Psychedelic Studies, The Drug Reform Co-ordination
Network, etc);
<LI>In the field of drugs policies, one of the most comprehensive
networks is the one run by the International Foundation for Drug
Policy and Human Rights, which contains information on the relevant
policies pursued by The Netherlands and those of other European
countries and the United States.  The United Nations support the
International Narcotics Control Board Web, in liaison with the
Commission on Narcotic Drugs, etc;
<LI>as for the use and abuse of drugs, networks have been set
up by official organisations such as the National Clearing House
for Alcohol and Drug Information, a section of the United States'
Department of Health and Human Services, and others set up by
NGOs or even anonymous persons, such as the WWW Drug Information
Server;
<LI>there are other information pages on risk limitation strategies,
such as the Habit Smart Agency and the Netherlands Drug Text Site.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
What all of these information systems have in common is that they
rely on sources that cannot be checked, since it is not clear
who rung the Internet services or who guarantees the reliability
of the data entered into them.  Most of the initiatives we have
listed offer no global and qualitative information on the production,
trafficking and use of illicit drugs and nor are they able to
set up connections between North and South.
<H3>Some ideas on alternative strategies and practices</H3>

<P>
Both locally and internationally, where there is an overdose of
information and sources distributing information, it is increasingly
difficult to find adequate information -by which we mean information
on the production of illicit drugs, although the same goes for
other fields - and strategies must be developed for liaison, and
the comparison, updating and dissemination of data, designed to
guide everyone, at various levels (local and national government,
international organisations, public and private social workers,
NGOs, grass roots associations), involved in the effort to find
responses to the problems linked to the production, distribution
and use of narcotic drugs, legal or illegal.
<P>
It is not easy to find global solutions to the problem - and it
would be extremely arrogant to think that we can - or out of the
blue to activate information resources that are coordinated and
founded on the same scientific bases or methods for data collection.
 Yet, it is possible to establish a procedure for the collection
and dissemination of information on the production of drugs making
proper use of and developing the existing information networks
and taking account of the following elements, vital for constructing
the methodology:
<UL>
<LI>a global approach to the phenomenon of the production, trafficking
and use of legal and illegal drugs, taking into account the political,
cultural, social, economic and ecological aspects of the problem;
<LI>a co-ordinated assessment of qualitative and quantitative
data on the phenomenon;
<LI>constant comparisons between governmental and nongovernmental
sources;
<LI>constant comparisons between North and South, between producer
countries and consumer countries;
<LI>the data and information collected must be operational; in
other words, they must be designed so that those using them can
determine coherent actions to deal with the gravity of the phenomenon
and assess their impact;
<LI>the scientific reliability of the collection of data;
<LI>accessibility to data.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
Undoubtedly, for this purpose we must bring into operation as
soon as possible the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and
Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) and develop it.  At European level and
internationally, this Centre could become an increasingly important
reference point for creating a culture, influencing opinion and
ensuring the reliability of data, and enabling everyone working
in North and South, governments, NGOs and international organisations
alike to coordinate their efforts.
<P>
However, on this score, it must be made clear that NGOs in North
and South working on the subjects of the production, marketing,
trafficking and use of drugs should be granted a fundamental role
at the EMCDDA.  Until now, their role and their possibility of
liaising with the Centre have been mainly left to local governments,
often guilty of partiality and not always willing to accept a
plurality of information or of assessment of data on the phenomenon,
since that might throw their own policies into crisis.  Such an
approach, often ideological rather than practical, makes it difficult
to find effective responses to the ever more serious problems
arising in these fields.  After all, by their very nature, NGOs
are able to collect information that could meet the criteria of
usability, globality and high quality which, as we have already
said, are vital for the construction of a network for disseminating
information on the subject.  At the same time, they are a mouthpiece
of the grassroots and the general public and, as such, may genuinely
represent those who experience the problems linked to the production,
use and trafficking of drugs, as well as those who want to play
an active part in the process of change.
<P>
We must also hope for the creation of an NGO committee in the
ECMDDA - representing both European and Southern or Eastern countries
- which could ensure liaison and oversee the assessment and dissemination
of information on the subject gathered in the North and South.
 Since the NGO community working in the sector represents a very
wide range of ideologies and since ideology influences their practical
activities, criteria for selecting NGOs for membership of this
committee must be established.  
<H3>Recommendations</H3>

<P>
By way of conclusion, in response to the questions analysed in
the previous paragraphs, we would like to make some recommendations
concerning the collection, continuous updating and dissemination
of information on the production of drugs.
<P>
1. A global approach must be adopted for dealing with the production,
trafficking and use of legal and illegal drugs, taking into account
the political, cultural, social, economic and ecological aspects
of the problem.  We feel it is important to emphasise that the
phenomenon of the use of substances defined as narcotics because
of the way they act on the individual (physically, psychologically,
in terms of relationships, etc) cannot be understood in all its
complexity if analysis is limited to illicit substances.
<P>
2. It is crucial to analyse together quantitative and qualitative
data on these phenomena in order to reduce the risk of bias and
manipulation and to make sure that they are useful for developing
appropriate intervention strategies.
<P>
3. It is crucial to effect constant comparisons between data from
governmental agencies (central and regional offices of national
governments, police forces, international organisations) and non-governmental
agencies between North and South, between producer countries and
consumer countries.  This can guarantee a genuine pluralism of
information sources and also make it possible to move from a multicultural
approach to another approach, transcultural or intercultural,
so that exchanges on these subject can transcend cultural, ideological
and ethnic barriers, etc.
<P>
4. Constant care must be taken to ensure that the data and information
collected are usable, in other words that they are such as to
enable those handling them to work out coherent measures for dealing
with the gravity of the phenomenon and assess the impact of strategies
already pursued to deal with the problem.
<P>
5. The scientific accuracy of data collection must be guaranteed,
in other words information or data may be integrated in an information
dissemination circuit only if the source, methodology, cultural
and ideological premises and goals for which the information was
collected are declared.
<P>
6. Data accessibility must be guaranteed, in other words politicians
(both government and opposition), civil servants, technicians,
those working in the public and private social services, NGOs
and the grass roots must be able to access the sources and monitor
the information.
<P>
7. The fundamental role played by grass roots NGOs, especially
local NGOs in the producer countries of the South, in the collection
and dissemination of information on this subject must be recognised
and encouraged.
<P>
8. The capacity of existing information networks must be increased
and fully used, and they should be brought into communication
with each other.
<P>
9. The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction
must be brought into action more quickly in order to create a
nerve and reference centre, amid the often chaotic plurality of
information sources on the subject of drugs.  The EMCDDA could
act, not only Europe-wide but also internationally, as a reference
centre increasingly creating a culture, influencing opinion, ensuring
the reliability of data and providing co-ordination between those
working in the North and the South, governments, NGOs and international
organisations.
<P>
10. It is fundamentally important to establish, through a committee
of NGOs working as a main partner of the ECMDDA, a system for
the communication and exchange of information between the European
Centre and non-governmental bodies and individuals in the North
and South which can be independent of national governments, so
as to avoid ideological bias and provide a link between the European
Union, local structures and ordinary citizens.

<H3>Drug dealing patterns</H3>

<P>
The relationship between conflicts and drugs is as old as man's
use of &quot;mind-altering substances&quot;. Their use is mentioned
in the &quot;Iliad&quot;. From the Inca conquests to the &quot;Opium
Wars&quot;, with the <I>hashishiyun</I> guerillas in between,
drugs have been at the core of many conflicts throughout history.
Two facts account for this relationship: firstly the effect of
the substance on the warrior, whether to raise his fighting mettle
or blind him to danger, or after battle to dispel the extreme
tension born of contests often fought hand to hand. This relationship
still exists in modern local conflicts such as those in Lebanon,
Afghanistan, former Yugoslavia or Liberia. But today, owing to
the added value which drugs acquire through prohibition, warfare
and drugs are related essentially at the economic level.
<H3>Impact on the situation of producers</H3>

<P>
The drug-conflict relationship is dependent on one of the main
characteristics of trade in these prohibited substances, namely
profit escalation: in the production, processing and sale of drugs,
each stage (itself broken up into a multitude of intermediate
operations) has a large profit margin. The more numerous the processing
phases, the higher the profit escalation. In the case of cocaine,
from the producer to the consumer, the price is multiplied by
a thousand on average, and by one thousand five hundred for heroin.
According to the sociologist Alain Joxe, each of these stages
constitutes a nucleus of power, of military might, for soldiers
can be fed with any surpluses.
<P>
For Third World farmers living in conflict-stricken zones, drug
economics have several implications:
<P>
a) given that it is impossible for them to attain the upper echelons
of processing and marketing, they are paid only a tiny proportion
of the profits generated by the drug trade.
<P>
b) they must nevertheless pay the armed factions dues, in general
10%, on the proceeds of sale of the substances destined for use
as drugs (cannabis and khat) or transformation into drugs (coca
leaf, cocaine base, opium) [Colombia, Afghanistan, India, Philippines,
Senegal, Ethiopia].
<P>
c) they may even be forced to grow crops against their will [Peru,
Liberia, Burma].
<P>
d) they must try to survive in crop-growing areas which are often
fought over by the various contenders [Colombia, Peru, Afghanistan,
Burma].
<P>
e) it is notable that the forces of repression [when not actually
associates in the traffic - Peru, Burma] victimise drug farmers
doubly as producers of illicit substances and as accomplices of
the rebel movements (despite the &quot;protection&quot; which
the latter are supposed to give them [Colombia, Peru, Burma, Philippines].
<H3>Impact on the populations at large</H3>

<P>
Most guerilla movements are not content to levy dues on farmers'
production:
<P>
a) They extract levies from the collectors of the base product,
the processing laboratories and the transport networks [Colombia,
Peru, Burma, Afghanistan, India, Turkey, Somalia]. These practices
tend to criminalise the entire population of the areas where rebel
groups operate, and to aggravate the conflicts taking place there.
<P>
b) Other groups have assumed direct control of the laboratories
where drugs are prepared, with the same effect as in point a)
[Colombia, Burma, Turkey, Azerbaijan].
<P>
c) Certain groups look after transport and sale of drugs up to
and including the consumer countries [Sri Lanka, Turkey, former
Yugoslavia, Algeria]. In so doing they take advantage of overseas
communities with which they can merge. Because of this, their
activities do much to fuel the racism and xenophobia afflicting
their compatriots in the consumer countries.
<P>
d) Some of these groups come to form links with criminal organisations,
in particular to obtain weapons in exchange for drugs [Algeria,
Sri Lanka], thereby casting discredit on the cause of their entire
movement.
<P>
Implication of state secret services
<P>
Yet rebel groups are not alone in being implicated in the drug
trafficking associated with conflicts. Even during the Cold War,
the secret services of major powers (especially the United States)
covered up the activities of their allies in Vietnam, Central
America, Afghanistan and Lebanon. The novelty is the democratisation
of these practices, which tend to be adopted by the secret services
of the Third World countries themselves since the end of the Cold
War.
<P>
Use of narcotics trading profits by sectors of state administrations
may primarily serve ends of personal gain. This would seem to
be the case with the Peruvian troops fighting the Sendero Luminoso
(&quot;Shining Path&quot;) movement in the Huallaga valley of
the Amazon region, or certain Nigerian army officers. Usually,
however, drug money goes either to finance arms purchases - the
case of the Burmese junta (SLORC) using the arms to oppose ethnic
insurgency - or for operations to destabilise the enemy, as conducted
by the Pakistan army intelligence (ISI) to subvert India by the
supply of drugs and arms to the Sikh insurgents in the Punjab
and the Muslim rebels in Kashmir.
<H3>Alternative policies</H3>

<P>
Use of drugs as the sinew of conflicts is perhaps one of the fields
where it is most difficult to envisage alternative strategies,
as the root causes of war have to be tackled before all else.
<P>
a) For instance, the international community needs to abandon
the view that the war in Chechnya is exclusively a matter of Russian
internal affairs. There is no doubt that the continuation of this
conflict will influence the formation of criminal networks exploiting
the large Chechen diaspora (Jordan, Turkey) with the aim of funding
resistance. One means of combating drug trafficking is therefore
to rally civil society in the European countries behind a peaceful
solution to this conflict. The same applies to the Kurdish conflict
in Turkey.
<P>
b) Many countries' territories are the scene both of conflicts
and of activities linked to drug production and trafficking. Where
the governments of these countries or sectors of their state administration
are presumed to be implicated in the traffic, the international
community and the nations concluding political and/or economic
agreements with the countries concerned should make it a rule
to subject such agreements to conditions regarding drug traffic
and money laundering. [This type of approach, already employed
in the human rights and environment fields, is to be distinguished
from pressure to implement eradication policies aimed essentially
at the peasant producers].
<P>
By way of a practical example of situations where such policies
could apply in a multilateral relations context, let us mention
the negotiations surrounding Turkey's accession to the European
Union. This country has become the leading producer and exporter
of heroin for Europe, and its gangs play a prominent part in the
process of economic privatisation. In the context of bilateral
relations, there are the French arms sales to Pakistan and the
US and French oil investments (Total-Unocal) in Burma. Since government
policies are dictated as often as not by economic and geo-strategic
interests, the civil society of the European countries must press
for action on these issues by the politicians and the various
governments.
<P>
c) There is far more limited scope for action by the international
organisations and governments where the rebel movements are concerned.
Nonetheless, government and NGO support for demands which are
often legitimate (social or religious rights, respect for minorities,
etc) should be accompanied by pressure to refrain from certain
tactics, recourse to drug money included.
<P>
d) Civil society can avail itself of the argument that the arms
used in local conflicts are more and more frequently paid for
with drug proceeds to pressure governments into exercising more
stringent control over arms sales.<HR>

</H3>

<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P>
The vast region of South-West Asia which includes India, Pakistan,
Iran, United Arab Emirates, Oman and the Arabian Sea/Gulf Regions,
has lately been considered as a precursor for international terrorism.
In this complicated configuration of religious, ethnic and sectarian
turmoil, which feeds a whole international market of political
and criminal violence, Pakistan is marked for its religious and
criminal hospitality for international terrorists and criminal
groups. The early beginning of unabated violence in the region
started along with the Iranian Islamic Shia change which claimed
more than 50.000 lives between the late 1970's and the early 80's.
<P>
It was followed by the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan and
the assorted geopolitical interests by the USA and its NATO allies
in Europe and the Middle Eastern royalties that launched the largest
intelligence operation, since the Vietnam war, amounting 6 US
billion $ in 8 years. The war in Afghanistan still continues though
officially the Soviet Union has fallen apart. A new trend of violence
has emerged escalating several wars between ethnic, sectarian
groups and nationalities. It was also during the years of the
Afghan war that the world's largest drug trafficking rings were
established dealing in heroin and morphine based processing amounting
to roughly up to 25 billion US $ per year from the region in South-West
Asia now identified as the &quot;Golden Crescent&quot;.
<P>
The result, emerging from the fifteen-year old Afghan conflict,
is the beginning of multi-conflicts in the region on ethnic, sectarian,
religious and nationalist grounds overflowing into Pakistan, India,
China, Iran and Kashmir, proves the massive use of drug money,
heroin production, opium harvesting and affiliated arms trafficking
in the region. What had begun, in the words of US Republican President
George Bush in 1980, &quot;God is with Afghans to defeat infidels&quot;,
in 1995 turned into several regional wars under controlled conditions
limiting to regional territorial disputes. In these existing conflicts,
the motivating reasons are external geopolitical interests and
the huge sums of money transacting from Europe, USA to the United
Arab Emirates and a perpetual effort for destabilisation.
<P>
These geopolitical interests, which range from petroleum companies
to small arms industries, to locate large water resources and
military routes to Central Asia, have created a social disorder.
Pakistan's only port city, Karachi, has witnessed massacres of
5000 persons in two years including those of women and children.
In Baluchistan, bordering Afghanistan, the Gulf and Iran, almost
the same number of massacres has been reported due to diverse
political, ethnic and government interests. In the North West
Frontier Province, nearly 2000 persons die every year in such
conflicts and this does not include Afghan conflict victims on
Pakistani soil. In Punjab, the largest province of the country,
revenge, territorial disputes and sexual discrimination claim
as many lives. This figure does not include political, sectarian
and ethnic rivalries. It is interesting to explain that the total
illiteracy rate in Pakistan is not more than 24% of the total
population of 112 million. Literacy here means those who can sign
their names. An average study shows that the total literacy rate
in the region does not exceed 30%.
<P>
In India, Kashmir could trigger a wave of ethnic, sectarian and
religious conflicts extending as far as the Chinese provinces.
Also in India, East Punjab could be explosive for Pakistan and
India because of the existing terrorist cooperation between Kashmiri,
Sri Lankan, Sikh and African fundamentalist and Muslim integrists.
Indian Narcotics control Board sources claim that in 1994, 154
kilos of heroin were seized from mujahideen routes of infiltrators
in Kashmir from the Pakistani border. On the Iranian frontier
with Pakistan, the Sunni minority movement, Sunni Milli Tehrik&eacute;
Iran, controls strategic zones against the Shia majority. Pakistan's
army is accused of protecting drug barons and trafficking, turning
the region into a pivotal point. At least 39 groups and parties
with theocratic tendencies could be alleged to be involved in
drug-trafficking in South-West Asia, following the fatwa by the
chief clergy of Kaaba, Saudi Arabia. He decreed the use of drug
money legible to combat infidels in a &quot;Mullah jirga&quot;
(Council of Clergy) in Jalalabad in 1983, beside the Pakistani
frontier in Afghanistan.
<H3>Current policies and conventions</H3>

<H4>Internal policies</H4>

<P>
It is more than ten years since different governments in Pakistan
started making amendments to the criminal penal code to include
severe punishments ranging from arrests, long-term prison sentences,
confiscation of properties of the accused and that of their relatives,
seizures of bank accounts and an under-studying proposal of capital
punishment. Furthermore, the creation of the Pakistan Narcotics
Control Board, its annexation in 1994, the creation of the Anti-Narcotics
Task Force, managed by the army, could be considered an integral
part of the anti-narcotics policy.
<H4>Regional conventions and accords</H4>

<P>
The regional states in South-West Asia have signed several anti-narcotics
accords and conventions within different regional cooperation
frame-works. These include the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), South
Asian Alliance on Regional Cooperation (SAARC), Gulf Countries
Cooperation (GCC), Organisation of Islamic Conference (OIC), Regional
Cooperation and Development between Iran, Pakistan and Turkey
(RCD), and Central Asian Economic Cooperation (CAEC).

Pakistan has signed informal and formal protocols and conventions
with India, Mauritius, Iran, United Arab Emirates, Iran, Afghanistan,
Bangladesh, Sri-Lanka, Russia, Central Asia, Azerbaijan, Saudi
Arabia, Thailand and Nigeria. There are also accords between the
Central Asian republics and Turkey, Iran, India and Mauritius,
etc.
<H4>International conventions</H4>

<P>
Pakistan, India, Iran, Afghanistan, United Arab Emirates and Saudi
Arabia are also signatories of international accords such as the
UN Vienna Convention, USDEA, British Customs, European Community,
Organisation of African Countries (OAC) trafficking monitoring
and Francophone states.
<H3>Impact</H3>

<P>
There is no impact or very little impact by the nearly 20 such
treaties, accords, protocols and charters signed by the regional
states on drug-trafficking. There are multiple reasons for this
failure. However, the major issue remains the corruption in the
region which also affects anti-drug units of the &quot;developed
countries&quot; operating in the area. The best example could
be the failure by the USDEA, British intelligence and the French
authorities to come out with an open policy on drug traffickers
in the region regarding their international political affiliation.
Furthermore, the jargon of the &quot;national security interests
- NSI&quot; has been able to keep in safe custody explosive dossiers
on such mysterious cooperations and un-explained factors of the
NSI.
<P>
<B>Examples -</B> The drug trade is operating through two distinct
official and un-official channels today. The startling scenario
that is increasingly emerging is that the official organisations
set up to combat the illegal drug trade are being the means of
perpetuation through clandestine activities. The Pakistani counter-espionage
Inter-Services-Intelligence mounted an operation code-named &quot;jihad&quot;
and created the National Logistics Cell to traffic arms and heroin
during the Afghan war. This strategy, which brought in huge sums
of money, helped to buy new-age weapons demonstrated in two racist-neo-nazi
exhibitions in the USA between 1983-88. In Europe, notably in
Switzerland, such expos were organised by neo-nazi groups, fascist
organisations and extreme right wing anti-Semitic militants. The
South-West Asia freedom fighters are understood to have participated
and purchased short-range weapons amounting to nearly US$ ten
billion. It could be safely estimated that there could be more
than 4 million heroin addicts in the region in South West Asia.
<H3>Alternative policies and practices</H3>

<P>
Expert opinion suggests that the international, regional or inter-state
protocols are obsolete, dating back to the first General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) from the 1890s when the USA, China,
India, Turkey and Iran competed for the international narcotic-drugs
makers. These protocols started taking the shape of an International
Charter from The Hague Convention of 1911, and other such treaties
were politically motivated for colonial access to production and
consumer zones. The rest of the later treaties and charters are
only a prolongation of the colonial accords.
<P>
Treaties and agreements signed to curtail the drug problem have
taken no notice of the reality-based account of the growers. These
landless peasants, who work on a crop price percentage basis actually
get nearly 5% of the total cost of work. They are also like &quot;bonded
labourers&quot; who, from generation to generation, keep multiplying
mortgages to the area chiefs of tribes, or middle-men speculating
on future crops. Most of the middle-men or area chiefs are linked
to political-power lobbies within the governments as seen in Pakistan,
Thailand, India, Bolivia, Peru, Nigeria, Senegal, USA, etc. These
lobbies are linked with groups and lobbies of arms manufacturers,
members of parliaments and secret service agents at the international
level.
<P>
<I>The alternative crop schemes</I> are also a complete failure
with the exception of the pilot projects where international donor
agencies have vested interests to protect certain experiments
in a controlled environment or for data collection. Alternative
schemes like the farming of potatoes, onions or other fruit or
vegetable crops do not bring enough money for a bonded grower
even to buy a square meal a day, let alone the clothes, medicine
or arms to protect themselves from traditional tribal or ethnic
animosities. The result, in most cases, is a widening gulf between
the politico-military governments and those citizens considered
below the international level of poverty. This leads to military
operations for eradication and the money donated by developed
countries for reimbursement to growers, is embezzled by the area
chiefs with the complicity of government officials.
<P>
<I>Anti-Narcotics Agencies</I>, in order to demonstrate their
efficiency to their respective governments and parliamentarian
committees to acquire funds, recruit networks of unaware mules
with the complicity of drug barons as seen in cases in Britain
between 1983-1992. This method is used often when a certain agency
is in the process of making the demand for augmenting its budget
to fight consumption, drug abuse or trafficking. In this sort
of corruption, evidence is erased to protect the chain of drug-barons
who also work as informers and are often known to have political
or military clout in the producing or trafficking state. This,
in return, leads to an informal understanding permitting a certain
amount of drug trafficking in the consumer country. The USDEA
and the French anti-drug agency have also used such techniques.
The victims are recruited on a low percentage like a plane ticket
or hotel expenses. These mules are usually uneducated un-employed,
illiterates and those who simply are given a pocket or a suitcase
at the airport &quot;for a friend&quot;.
<P>
<B>It would be hard to counter such international mal-practices
and corruption among officials.</B> It is also necessary to develop
methods for an out-reach amongst the target-communities. Harsh
penalties have not stopped drug trafficking in states where capital
punishment is common. The difference between classes while planning
a communication or alternative strategies by officials also plays
an important role. The infrastructure of the constitution, administration,
bureaucracy, army, workers rights, human rights and economic policy
do not correspond to the native culture and ethics. In brief,
 a colonial structure which has been personalised on a country-to
-country basis becomes the main obstacle. This might require the
study of the local judicial system and social definitions organised
by councils (panchayat), jirga, fines, economic and barter practices.
<P>
This could only be made possible by establishing a communicator
between bodies' officials, district administrations and effected
groups. The economic gap in such countries has created a class
of experts with little field experience and very little knowledge
of regional, local and cross-border communication patterns. Even
if they are aware of such patterns, it is used against the will
of existing traditions. Traditions such as street theatres, folklore,
its concurrent interpretation and negligence of the social trends
needs to be corrected.
<H3>Strategies</H3>

<H4>Introduction</H4>

<P>
It is evident that <I>the colonial infrastructure cannot be abolished</I>
as this would mean the re-thickening of already existing regional
conflicts based on local, tribal, ethnic, sectorial and religious
norms. Several wars would be needed to settle these issues which
is not the purpose here. To formulate a comprehensive strategy,
it is imperative to devise subtle NGO workings, simplified communication
patterns and message-based economic ideas. This could be achieved
by the creation and use of the field groups to collect intelligence
which should be helpful in communicating the issues to the consumer
states. This would mean the dialogue at three levels: a) Between
the North and the South on an informal basis involving NGOs formed
on meagre resources and run by the local population, recommended
by the North-South field group; b) Between the government and
its functionaries to amend certain laws which only help in providing
large sums of financial assistance from donor agencies contributing
to the high level of corruption; c) To establish a simple communication
pattern already existent in regions between the above-categorised
NGOs to develop cooperation on a barter basis and to form larger
groups of jirga, panchayat and ethnic, caste and sectarian basis.
<H4>Local strategies</H4>

<P>
Such strategies would permit communities, groups and tribes to
start a dialogue, in return for controlled financial assistance
by the donor agencies thus eliminating the possibility of corruption.
These strategies would function through simple, small and controllable
NGOs formed in regions where linguistic dialects differ from one
region to another but the language remains the same. Several test
pilot projects should be envisaged on a controlled risk basis.
These NGOs, formed on recommendations by the North-South Centre,
should be controlled by the experienced and expert field staff
with higher degrees in international relations, ethnology, geopolitics,
micro-macro economic planning with Third World work experiences
in urban / rural transition areas. Students must be included as
part of the <B>alternative administration and communication strategy
training programme (AACTP).</B>
<H4>National level</H4>

<P>
This step could be considered difficult because of the prevalent
mistrust embedded in cultures of certain poverty-stricken regions.
To make things worse, these miseries are a lucrative exploitable
market for the federal, provincial governments and certain donor
agencies. In certain cases, the opposition to such ambitious projects
has come from the parliamentarians, police and the army who see
their zones of influence slipping away. To counter this, instead
of arm twisting through diplomatic effort, out reach is advised
by including in pilot projects members of low income groups from
the ruling tribe or area chief in order to allow cross-flow of
information / intelligence. A comprehensive communication plan
should be made available at the national level through the existing
infrastructure, maybe corrupt, of local government schemes launched
in the regions by the government on a need-to-know basis.
<H4>Regional strategies</H4>

<P>
Following the same infrastructure, a North-South Centre (NSC)
bureaux should be formed on a regional basis to study all social,
ethnic and religious differences existing in a cross-border format.
One example comes from India and Pakistan in a particular zone
of Kashmir which has been the cause of three wars between these
two countries. Another example is the differences between ethnic
Pashtoun and Uzbek identities in Afghanistan and Pakistan. To
achieve this, a maximised level of impartiality would have to
be maintained in order to let the population and the governments
themselves evaluate the staff involved in such projects.
<H4>International level</H4>

<P>
At this level, the North-South Centre is advised to circulate
inter-EU confidential memoranda in order to draw interest. Philanthropic
donor and human rights organisations / institutions are advised
to be contacted to form a protection blanket for pilot projects.
It is strongly advised to include in such projects 60% of women.

<H3>''Can we stamp out illegal drug crops in the Third World?''
</H3>

<P>
Despite the crackdown on illicit drug producers and dealers, increasingly
large areas are given over to the production of cannabis, poppies
and coca in the poorest regions of the Third World.
<P>
For a long time, these plants were sown or propagated for individual
consumption by the growers in the same way as many cereals, tubers
and fibre plants. Even today, many of the rural communities in
the &quot;Golden Triangle&quot; (Myanmar, Laos and Thailand) still
smoke opium for its analgesic effects in the event of severe pain.
Similarly, coca is traditionally grown in the low Andean valleys
of the Amazon Basin (Peru, Bolivia, etc.) for strictly medicinal
or religious purposes. Coca leaves, which are rich in vitamins
and minerals, are used to make herbal teas, providing a completely
legal remedy for altitude sickness. Coca leaves are also frequently
chewed by undernourished communities to stave off hunger.  Similarly,
khat is grown in Ethiopia and Yemen to suppress the hunger of
the poorest farmers, and enable them to work all day without too
much discomfort.  As for cannabis, it is often used to flavour
soups in south-east Asia, a practice which is in no way frowned
upon.
<P>
In recent decades, the farmers of the most isolated regions have
become involved in international trade.  The &quot;drug&quot;
plants which they used to grow for their own use, and to sell
in local markets, have now become true &quot;cash crops&quot;,
grown for export in the same way as tea, coffee and cocoa in other
parts of the world.  The sale of the drugs made from these plants
has not always been illegal; up until 1956 the French government
awarded itself the monopoly of the trade in opium from French
Indochina, via a body set up specifically for this purpose; the
<I>&quot;r&eacute;gie indochinoise de l'opium&quot;</I>, which
for a long time worked in a similar way to the <I>&quot;r&eacute;gie
des kifs et tabacs&quot;</I> in Morocco.  The fact is that new
outlets have been created by the internationalisation of trade
and the increasing demand for new derivative products (morphine,
heroin, cocaine, etc.), dealing in which is now strictly illegal.
<P>
Small Third-World farmers, whose equipment, in many cases, is
still manual (hoes, spades, picks, machetes, etc.), or drawn by
draught animals (ploughs, etc.), can no longer compete with cereal
farmers in large, industrialised countries whose farming methods
have long included mechanised, motor-driven and chemical systems.
 The productivity of poor farmers growing wheat, corn and rice
in inter-tropical regions is often a hundred times lower than
that of the major producers of the Paris Basin, the North-American
&quot;corn belt&quot; and the Mississippi Delta.  It is therefore
in the interest of many of these farmers to turn to the specialised
production of exclusively tropical commodities, for which there
is less direct competition from temperate regions, i.e. coffee,
bananas and rubber, but also opium and coca.
<P>
This kind of specialisation runs counter to the food security
of the populations in question, whose food is then largely dependent
on the importation of grain and flour which can be delivered for
less cost, even to the least accessible places.  However, it is
a direct result of the &quot;free&quot; trade policies followed
by governments and encouraged by international financial organisations
such as the IMF, World Bank, whose aim is to increase the variety
of types of agriculture in accordance with the &quot;comparative
advantages&quot; of different regions.  The problem is that the
most profitable products for export in the most remote regions
are, therefore, those for which a high price can be obtained for
the smallest volume possible, i.e. hashish, gum opium, cocaine
base paste, etc.  Is it not therefore contradictory to advocate
&quot;free&quot; exchange while at the same time prohibiting the
production and sale of commodities which best meet the criteria
of specialisation according to comparative advantages?  Is it
logical to impose the &quot;free&quot; importation of foodstuffs
on those whose production is declared to be &quot;illicit&quot;?
<P>
The fight against illegal drugs therefore presupposes that Third
World countries have the possibility of protecting their national
agriculture by means of tariffs (customs duty), in order to re-evaluate
(initially upwards) the price of food crops produced for domestic
markets.  However, this selective protection runs counter to the
structural adjustment plans recommended by international financing
organisations, and presupposes real political courage on the part
of the governments concerned, as the resulting rise in the cost
of food would first affect the urban population, who could be
expected to protest in anger at this.  However, this would be
much less traumatic than monetary devaluation, which would immediately
put up the cost of all imported goods, including equipment required
by farmers to update their farming methods.
<P>
Rural credit and input subsidy schemes must be resolutely implemented
to enable the poorest farmers to have access, at last, to the
equipment they need if they are gradually to increase their productivity
without adversely affecting the environment.  Real technological
research and development policies should also be encouraged for
those farmers in the poorest, most remote regions.  These farmers
need a relatively wide range of equipment, and must be able to
set up farming systems with high added value, combining rural
crafts, livestock and crop farming, without excessive specialisation.
 Priority must be given to anti-risk practices and to techniques
aimed at increasing the production of biomass and the recycling
of organic matter.  The increase in productivity obtained by using
new equipment should serve to generally increase the income of
farmers without resulting in the work force being driven out to
urban centres or virgin-forest areas.  In this way, the low-income
Andean farming communities would be able to improve their standard
of living without having to emigrate to the shanty towns of Lima
or La Paz or go down into the &quot;yungas&quot; to crush coca!
<P>
True land reform aimed at redistributing large estates to small
farmers would enable these farmers to set themselves up on the
most fertile land, which they have been deprived of for too long.
<P>
Productivity can be considerably increased by making intra-regional
transport easier.  All projects which aim to make it easier to
acquire beasts of burden, draught animals and carts serve to increase
production, and thus farmers' income, since the time saved in
travel and transport can be turned to good account in the fields,
for the direct purposes of production.  Facilitating intra-regional
trade between farmers whose productivity is much the same almost
always turns out to be more effective than opening up major roads,
the first result of which is to expose the least equipped farmers
to international competition.  Combatting the production of illicit
drugs presupposes that the ways in which small-scale farmers are
involved in trade are reconsidered so that these farmers can effectively
emerge from their &quot;underdevelopment&quot;.<HR>

<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P>
In the field of North-South relations, three subjects are the
source of considerable tension: migration, drugs and the environment.
 Recent South-North migration in the post-war period and migration
from country to town in the south were initially the result of
a demand for cheap, unskilled labour and then became a way of
escaping poverty.  This paper does not deal with migration as
such, although it underlies much of what is said since immigrants
and their descendants, the marginalised groups ''par excellence'',
have brought natural drugs with them into the developed countries,
passing on the drug-taking habit, acting as import and distribution
agents and making up a sizeable proportion of users.
<P>
The drug problem becomes an international one - Shanghai Conference
of 1909 - once production is sited in one location catering for
consumption in another - ie the West, or in other words once a
world drug market has been established.  In addition, the delocalisation
of drug production shows that the growing demand by the West over
the last thirty years (1) has been satisfied almost exclusively
by natural drugs such as marijuana, cocaine and opiates, whereas
synthetic psychotropic drugs would appear to have a marginal role
in the illegal use and supply of drugs, in spite of the considerable
development of these substances by the pharmaceutical industry
over the same period (2).
<P>
For developing countries, the &quot;naturalisation&quot;, as it
were, of the use of psychotropic substances and the fact that
they are produced on their own territory has made the drug problem
a largely agricultural one, falling outside the economy.  However,
the agricultural production of drugs has not been caused by international
demand for psychotropic substances alone; a contributory factor
has been the poverty in the rural areas of developing countries
and the failure of traditional forms of agriculture on which they
depend economically.
<P>
There are two aspects to the failure of agriculture in the developing
countries: (a) the loss of food security and (b) the increasing
plundering of their renewable natural resources.  Thus, at the
end of the last decade, out of the 207 countries recognised by
the United Nations, only 28 did not have a deficit in cereals:
13 of the 23 industrialised countries and 15 of the 184 developing
countries.  Of these only Argentina, Hungary, South Africa and
Thailand are exporters whereas the US, Canada, France and Australia
account for 85% of net cereal exports.  In the last ten years,
the world has lost 1.8% of its forests, with the US losing 1.1%;
Canada regained 5.8% and the European Union 3.4%, whereas South
America lost 4.6%, Africa 3.6% and Asia 5.3%.  Forests are therefore
being replaced with inefficient farming and stockbreeding (forestry
operations in fact account for only 1-3% of tree felling in the
developing countries).
<H3>Local impact of international policies</H3>

<P>
In response to the constant increase in the use of and demand
for psychotropic substances, control policies in the post-60s
period were focused predominantly on suppressing the supply (production
and trafficking) of drugs - which proved effective in the industrialised
countries.  The reaction from the drug traffickers has been delocalisation
of the production of psychotropic substances in relation to traditional
markets and naturalisation of consumption.  This has proved to
be a very effective strategy for controlling the risks of legal
sanctions and minimising the costs.  Although the unit cost of
synthetic substances is much lower than that of natural drugs,
the cost of investing in equipment, installations and raw materials,
skilled labour and pharmaceutical technology is considerable in
comparison with the cost of sub-contracting agricultural production
and small or large-scale extraction of natural psychotropic substances
(3).  Moreover, control of these unlawful activities by the criminal
courts is clearly much more lax in the developing countries where
corruption costs are lower.  In short, the delocalisation and
naturalisation of the production and consumption of drugs, which
create the illicit international market and give the developing
countries a role to play in it, are consequences of international
control policies which have put greater emphasis on cutting off
supply than on prevention and treatment of drug abuse.
<P>
The main feature of international agricultural trade, where technically
speaking the production and trafficking of natural drugs fit in,
is the continual fall in food prices  there has been a 50% drop
in the last forty years due to the fact that industrialised countries
have been subsidising farmers and livestock breeders over the
last twenty years, on average to the tune of 44%.  When international
agricultural prices fall below their production costs, farmers
in developing countries, who receive few or no subsidies, and
who furthermore have to compete on their local and national markets
with subsidised imports, have no other &quot;logical&quot; option
but to minimise production costs by cutting down on the use of
agricultural technology available, and then, if they wish to achieve
&quot;economic viability&quot;, to make extensive use of land
and water resources, constantly extending the area they use for
farming and destroying in the process the forests and biodiversity
found therein.
<P>
The general answer from developing countries to the agricultural
policies of the developed countries has been to abandon agricultural
technology and over-exploit renewable natural resources.  The
specific answer from those countries which have the necessary
soil and climate has been to produce natural drugs.  Furthermore,
the great paradox of drug production is that it has a smaller
impact on the environment, since it offers a higher market value
while using fewer natural resources.
<H3>Proposals for alternative polices: towards a new agenda</H3>

<P>
In international relations, the question of psychotropic drugs
has been approached in two different ways: first, the view prevalent
in the industrialised countries that consumption cannot be controlled
unless the supply  ie production in the developing countries 
is cut off; secondly, the view in the developing countries that
drug production and supply cannot be controlled while there is
still a demand in the industrialised countries.  Operationally,
both arguments are valid for the current illicit market, but conceptually,
they are inadequate since they overlook two basic explanatory
facts: (i) suppression of illicit production in industrialised
countries generates demand and (ii) the agricultural and environmental
crisis in developing countries generates supply.
<P>
The illicit production of psychotropic substances has not been
relocated from industry to agriculture in developed countries,
because farmers in those countries have not become impoverished
nor have rural areas been untouched by modern technology.
<P>
Neither the problem of the illicit production of natural drugs
nor the problem of protecting the environment and natural renewable
resources can be resolved outside the international agricultural
market.  The new agenda in North-South relations must deal with
the problem of the production of natural drugs and the plundering
of renewable natural resources in the developing countries in
tandem with the agricultural policies of the developed countries
based on subsidised agricultural production.  It is this which
has led to the developing countries losing their competitive advantages
and has turned them from food exporters into food importers.
<P>
It should not be forgotten that if the supply of natural drugs
and psychotropic substances were to be controlled effectively
but without any control on demand in the developed countries,
then consumers would resort to solvents, petrol and alcohol to
satisfy their desire or need to alter their state of consciousness
or behaviour in the same way as the marginalised and children
do today in the developing countries.  All these substances  alcohol,
psychotropic and natural drugs, solvents and petrol - have the
same function, the ability to satisfy needs.  Consequently, if
there is no real efficient and proactive way to prevent the desire
and deal with the need for psychotropic substances and the only
approach is to seek to suppress the problem, we will witness a
constant change in the pattern of use  naturalisation or artificialisation
 and delocalisation of the production of psychotropic substances
depending on what the situation is regarding the suppression and
illegal supply of these drugs.
<H3>Recommended strategies for a new agenda</H3>

<P>
Alternative development is the only possible strategy for controlling
illegal drug cultivation since it is only in this way that the
poor farmers in the tropical regions of the Third World can escape
from the stranglehold put on them by international drug traffickers.
 Only then will drug traffickers be obliged to take over the risks
and costs involved in directly managing illicit drug cultivation
(which has already happened in some areas of the Andes) or be
obliged to take over the substantial industrial and financial
risks involved in the production of synthetic drugs (which has
also recently been seen).  However, it is not possible to achieve
any significant successes with alternative development, ie lasting,
environmentally-sound successes which can continue indefinitely
if there is no change in the current conditions of the international
agricultural market, which depend on the agricultural policies
of the industrialised countries.
<P>
A strategy for action should present the ecological advantages
of alternative development over drug cultivation, showing the
devastating impact which the agricultural policies of the north
have on the south.  The areas where this needs to be brought home
are primarily the ecological movement and the authorities responsible
for the environment.  Debates on these issues have given greater
prominence to environmental problems which have a less serious
impact on nature or which entail fewer risks for humanity such
as the green label campaign for wood products, the ban on hunting
aquatic mammals, nuclear tests, etc. thereby glossing over more
important and threatening problems such as the destruction of
forests and steppes (land biodiversity) as a result of inefficient
farming and stockbreeding, the over-fishing of seas, rivers and
lakes (aquatic biodiversity) and the pollution caused by processing
of catches, the increasing pollution of all environments caused
by industrial, agricultural, household and other waste, etc.
<H3>NOTES:</H3>

(1) A demand which began at the turn of the century and escalated
with the first signs of the current economic and cultural crisis
during the 60s and 70s.
<P>
(2) Of the psychotropic substances subject to control, some 180
are synthetic products or derivatives and only half a dozen or
so are natural.
<P>
(3) It should be stressed that the current expansion in the illicit
production of psychotropic substances, or their precursors, is
taking place primarily in the poorer countries of the Third World,
or in the new Third World made up of the former socialist countries
which are also producing natural drugs.

<H3>Drug dealing patterns</H3>

<P>
The relationship between conflicts and drugs is as old as man's
use of &quot;mind-altering substances&quot;. Their use is mentioned
in the &quot;Iliad&quot;. From the Inca conquests to the &quot;Opium
Wars&quot;, with the <I>hashishiyun</I> guerillas in between,
drugs have been at the core of many conflicts throughout history.
Two facts account for this relationship: firstly the effect of
the substance on the warrior, whether to raise his fighting mettle
or blind him to danger, or after battle to dispel the extreme
tension born of contests often fought hand to hand. This relationship
still exists in modern local conflicts such as those in Lebanon,
Afghanistan, former Yugoslavia or Liberia. But today, owing to
the added value which drugs acquire through prohibition, warfare
and drugs are related essentially at the economic level.
<H3>Impact on the situation of producers</H3>

<P>
The drug-conflict relationship is dependent on one of the main
characteristics of trade in these prohibited substances, namely
profit escalation: in the production, processing and sale of drugs,
each stage (itself broken up into a multitude of intermediate
operations) has a large profit margin. The more numerous the processing
phases, the higher the profit escalation. In the case of cocaine,
from the producer to the consumer, the price is multiplied by
a thousand on average, and by one thousand five hundred for heroin.
According to the sociologist Alain Joxe, each of these stages
constitutes a nucleus of power, of military might, for soldiers
can be fed with any surpluses.
<P>
For Third World farmers living in conflict-stricken zones, drug
economics have several implications:
<P>
a) given that it is impossible for them to attain the upper echelons
of processing and marketing, they are paid only a tiny proportion
of the profits generated by the drug trade.
<P>
b) they must nevertheless pay the armed factions dues, in general
10%, on the proceeds of sale of the substances destined for use
as drugs (cannabis and khat) or transformation into drugs (coca
leaf, cocaine base, opium) [Colombia, Afghanistan, India, Philippines,
Senegal, Ethiopia].
<P>
c) they may even be forced to grow crops against their will [Peru,
Liberia, Burma].
<P>
d) they must try to survive in crop-growing areas which are often
fought over by the various contenders [Colombia, Peru, Afghanistan,
Burma].
<P>
e) it is notable that the forces of repression [when not actually
associates in the traffic - Peru, Burma] victimise drug farmers
doubly as producers of illicit substances and as accomplices of
the rebel movements (despite the &quot;protection&quot; which
the latter are supposed to give them [Colombia, Peru, Burma, Philippines].
<H3>Impact on the populations at large</H3>

<P>
Most guerilla movements are not content to levy dues on farmers'
production:
<P>
a) They extract levies from the collectors of the base product,
the processing laboratories and the transport networks [Colombia,
Peru, Burma, Afghanistan, India, Turkey, Somalia]. These practices
tend to criminalise the entire population of the areas where rebel
groups operate, and to aggravate the conflicts taking place there.
<P>
b) Other groups have assumed direct control of the laboratories
where drugs are prepared, with the same effect as in point a)
[Colombia, Burma, Turkey, Azerbaijan].
<P>
c) Certain groups look after transport and sale of drugs up to
and including the consumer countries [Sri Lanka, Turkey, former
Yugoslavia, Algeria]. In so doing they take advantage of overseas
communities with which they can merge. Because of this, their
activities do much to fuel the racism and xenophobia afflicting
their compatriots in the consumer countries.
<P>
d) Some of these groups come to form links with criminal organisations,
in particular to obtain weapons in exchange for drugs [Algeria,
Sri Lanka], thereby casting discredit on the cause of their entire
movement.
<P>
Implication of state secret services
<P>
Yet rebel groups are not alone in being implicated in the drug
trafficking associated with conflicts. Even during the Cold War,
the secret services of major powers (especially the United States)
covered up the activities of their allies in Vietnam, Central
America, Afghanistan and Lebanon. The novelty is the democratisation
of these practices, which tend to be adopted by the secret services
of the Third World countries themselves since the end of the Cold
War.
<P>
Use of narcotics trading profits by sectors of state administrations
may primarily serve ends of personal gain. This would seem to
be the case with the Peruvian troops fighting the Sendero Luminoso
(&quot;Shining Path&quot;) movement in the Huallaga valley of
the Amazon region, or certain Nigerian army officers. Usually,
however, drug money goes either to finance arms purchases - the
case of the Burmese junta (SLORC) using the arms to oppose ethnic
insurgency - or for operations to destabilise the enemy, as conducted
by the Pakistan army intelligence (ISI) to subvert India by the
supply of drugs and arms to the Sikh insurgents in the Punjab
and the Muslim rebels in Kashmir.
<H3>Alternative policies</H3>

<P>
Use of drugs as the sinew of conflicts is perhaps one of the fields
where it is most difficult to envisage alternative strategies,
as the root causes of war have to be tackled before all else.
<P>
a) For instance, the international community needs to abandon
the view that the war in Chechnya is exclusively a matter of Russian
internal affairs. There is no doubt that the continuation of this
conflict will influence the formation of criminal networks exploiting
the large Chechen diaspora (Jordan, Turkey) with the aim of funding
resistance. One means of combating drug trafficking is therefore
to rally civil society in the European countries behind a peaceful
solution to this conflict. The same applies to the Kurdish conflict
in Turkey.
<P>
b) Many countries' territories are the scene both of conflicts
and of activities linked to drug production and trafficking. Where
the governments of these countries or sectors of their state administration
are presumed to be implicated in the traffic, the international
community and the nations concluding political and/or economic
agreements with the countries concerned should make it a rule
to subject such agreements to conditions regarding drug traffic
and money laundering. [This type of approach, already employed
in the human rights and environment fields, is to be distinguished
from pressure to implement eradication policies aimed essentially
at the peasant producers].
<P>
By way of a practical example of situations where such policies
could apply in a multilateral relations context, let us mention
the negotiations surrounding Turkey's accession to the European
Union. This country has become the leading producer and exporter
of heroin for Europe, and its gangs play a prominent part in the
process of economic privatisation. In the context of bilateral
relations, there are the French arms sales to Pakistan and the
US and French oil investments (Total-Unocal) in Burma. Since government
policies are dictated as often as not by economic and geo-strategic
interests, the civil society of the European countries must press
for action on these issues by the politicians and the various
governments.
<P>
c) There is far more limited scope for action by the international
organisations and governments where the rebel movements are concerned.
Nonetheless, government and NGO support for demands which are
often legitimate (social or religious rights, respect for minorities,
etc) should be accompanied by pressure to refrain from certain
tactics, recourse to drug money included.
<P>
d) Civil society can avail itself of the argument that the arms
used in local conflicts are more and more frequently paid for
with drug proceeds to pressure governments into exercising more
stringent control over arms sales.<HR>

</H3>

<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P>
The vast region of South-West Asia which includes India, Pakistan,
Iran, United Arab Emirates, Oman and the Arabian Sea/Gulf Regions,
has lately been considered as a precursor for international terrorism.
In this complicated configuration of religious, ethnic and sectarian
turmoil, which feeds a whole international market of political
and criminal violence, Pakistan is marked for its religious and
criminal hospitality for international terrorists and criminal
groups. The early beginning of unabated violence in the region
started along with the Iranian Islamic Shia change which claimed
more than 50.000 lives between the late 1970's and the early 80's.
<P>
It was followed by the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan and
the assorted geopolitical interests by the USA and its NATO allies
in Europe and the Middle Eastern royalties that launched the largest
intelligence operation, since the Vietnam war, amounting 6 US
billion $ in 8 years. The war in Afghanistan still continues though
officially the Soviet Union has fallen apart. A new trend of violence
has emerged escalating several wars between ethnic, sectarian
groups and nationalities. It was also during the years of the
Afghan war that the world's largest drug trafficking rings were
established dealing in heroin and morphine based processing amounting
to roughly up to 25 billion US $ per year from the region in South-West
Asia now identified as the &quot;Golden Crescent&quot;.
<P>
The result, emerging from the fifteen-year old Afghan conflict,
is the beginning of multi-conflicts in the region on ethnic, sectarian,
religious and nationalist grounds overflowing into Pakistan, India,
China, Iran and Kashmir, proves the massive use of drug money,
heroin production, opium harvesting and affiliated arms trafficking
in the region. What had begun, in the words of US Republican President
George Bush in 1980, &quot;God is with Afghans to defeat infidels&quot;,
in 1995 turned into several regional wars under controlled conditions
limiting to regional territorial disputes. In these existing conflicts,
the motivating reasons are external geopolitical interests and
the huge sums of money transacting from Europe, USA to the United
Arab Emirates and a perpetual effort for destabilisation.
<P>
These geopolitical interests, which range from petroleum companies
to small arms industries, to locate large water resources and
military routes to Central Asia, have created a social disorder.
Pakistan's only port city, Karachi, has witnessed massacres of
5000 persons in two years including those of women and children.
In Baluchistan, bordering Afghanistan, the Gulf and Iran, almost
the same number of massacres has been reported due to diverse
political, ethnic and government interests. In the North West
Frontier Province, nearly 2000 persons die every year in such
conflicts and this does not include Afghan conflict victims on
Pakistani soil. In Punjab, the largest province of the country,
revenge, territorial disputes and sexual discrimination claim
as many lives. This figure does not include political, sectarian
and ethnic rivalries. It is interesting to explain that the total
illiteracy rate in Pakistan is not more than 24% of the total
population of 112 million. Literacy here means those who can sign
their names. An average study shows that the total literacy rate
in the region does not exceed 30%.
<P>
In India, Kashmir could trigger a wave of ethnic, sectarian and
religious conflicts extending as far as the Chinese provinces.
Also in India, East Punjab could be explosive for Pakistan and
India because of the existing terrorist cooperation between Kashmiri,
Sri Lankan, Sikh and African fundamentalist and Muslim integrists.
Indian Narcotics control Board sources claim that in 1994, 154
kilos of heroin were seized from mujahideen routes of infiltrators
in Kashmir from the Pakistani border. On the Iranian frontier
with Pakistan, the Sunni minority movement, Sunni Milli Tehrik&eacute;
Iran, controls strategic zones against the Shia majority. Pakistan's
army is accused of protecting drug barons and trafficking, turning
the region into a pivotal point. At least 39 groups and parties
with theocratic tendencies could be alleged to be involved in
drug-trafficking in South-West Asia, following the fatwa by the
chief clergy of Kaaba, Saudi Arabia. He decreed the use of drug
money legible to combat infidels in a &quot;Mullah jirga&quot;
(Council of Clergy) in Jalalabad in 1983, beside the Pakistani
frontier in Afghanistan.
<H3>Current policies and conventions</H3>

<H4>Internal policies</H4>

<P>
It is more than ten years since different governments in Pakistan
started making amendments to the criminal penal code to include
severe punishments ranging from arrests, long-term prison sentences,
confiscation of properties of the accused and that of their relatives,
seizures of bank accounts and an under-studying proposal of capital
punishment. Furthermore, the creation of the Pakistan Narcotics
Control Board, its annexation in 1994, the creation of the Anti-Narcotics
Task Force, managed by the army, could be considered an integral
part of the anti-narcotics policy.
<H4>Regional conventions and accords</H4>

<P>
The regional states in South-West Asia have signed several anti-narcotics
accords and conventions within different regional cooperation
frame-works. These include the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), South
Asian Alliance on Regional Cooperation (SAARC), Gulf Countries
Cooperation (GCC), Organisation of Islamic Conference (OIC), Regional
Cooperation and Development between Iran, Pakistan and Turkey
(RCD), and Central Asian Economic Cooperation (CAEC).
<H4>Interstate conventions</H4>

<P>
Pakistan has signed informal and formal protocols and conventions
with India, Mauritius, Iran, United Arab Emirates, Iran, Afghanistan,
Bangladesh, Sri-Lanka, Russia, Central Asia, Azerbaijan, Saudi
Arabia, Thailand and Nigeria. There are also accords between the
Central Asian republics and Turkey, Iran, India and Mauritius,
etc.
<H4>International conventions</H4>

<P>
Pakistan, India, Iran, Afghanistan, United Arab Emirates and Saudi
Arabia are also signatories of international accords such as the
UN Vienna Convention, USDEA, British Customs, European Community,
Organisation of African Countries (OAC) trafficking monitoring
and Francophone states.
<H3>Impact</H3>

<P>
There is no impact or very little impact by the nearly 20 such
treaties, accords, protocols and charters signed by the regional
states on drug-trafficking. There are multiple reasons for this
failure. However, the major issue remains the corruption in the
region which also affects anti-drug units of the &quot;developed
countries&quot; operating in the area. The best example could
be the failure by the USDEA, British intelligence and the French
authorities to come out with an open policy on drug traffickers
in the region regarding their international political affiliation.
Furthermore, the jargon of the &quot;national security interests
- NSI&quot; has been able to keep in safe custody explosive dossiers
on such mysterious cooperations and un-explained factors of the
NSI.
<P>
<B>Examples -</B> The drug trade is operating through two distinct
official and un-official channels today. The startling scenario
that is increasingly emerging is that the official organisations
set up to combat the illegal drug trade are being the means of
perpetuation through clandestine activities. The Pakistani counter-espionage
Inter-Services-Intelligence mounted an operation code-named &quot;jihad&quot;
and created the National Logistics Cell to traffic arms and heroin
during the Afghan war. This strategy, which brought in huge sums
of money, helped to buy new-age weapons demonstrated in two racist-neo-nazi
exhibitions in the USA between 1983-88. In Europe, notably in
Switzerland, such expos were organised by neo-nazi groups, fascist
organisations and extreme right wing anti-Semitic militants. The
South-West Asia freedom fighters are understood to have participated
and purchased short-range weapons amounting to nearly US$ ten
billion. It could be safely estimated that there could be more
than 4 million heroin addicts in the region in South West Asia.
<H3>Alternative policies and practices</H3>

<P>
Expert opinion suggests that the international, regional or inter-state
protocols are obsolete, dating back to the first General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) from the 1890s when the USA, China,
India, Turkey and Iran competed for the international narcotic-drugs
makers. These protocols started taking the shape of an International
Charter from The Hague Convention of 1911, and other such treaties
were politically motivated for colonial access to production and
consumer zones. The rest of the later treaties and charters are
only a prolongation of the colonial accords.
<P>
Treaties and agreements signed to curtail the drug problem have
taken no notice of the reality-based account of the growers. These
landless peasants, who work on a crop price percentage basis actually
get nearly 5% of the total cost of work. They are also like &quot;bonded
labourers&quot; who, from generation to generation, keep multiplying
mortgages to the area chiefs of tribes, or middle-men speculating
on future crops. Most of the middle-men or area chiefs are linked
to political-power lobbies within the governments as seen in Pakistan,
Thailand, India, Bolivia, Peru, Nigeria, Senegal, USA, etc. These
lobbies are linked with groups and lobbies of arms manufacturers,
members of parliaments and secret service agents at the international
level.
<P>
<I>The alternative crop schemes</I> are also a complete failure
with the exception of the pilot projects where international donor
agencies have vested interests to protect certain experiments
in a controlled environment or for data collection. Alternative
schemes like the farming of potatoes, onions or other fruit or
vegetable crops do not bring enough money for a bonded grower
even to buy a square meal a day, let alone the clothes, medicine
or arms to protect themselves from traditional tribal or ethnic
animosities. The result, in most cases, is a widening gulf between
the politico-military governments and those citizens considered
below the international level of poverty. This leads to military
operations for eradication and the money donated by developed
countries for reimbursement to growers, is embezzled by the area
chiefs with the complicity of government officials.
<P>
<I>Anti-Narcotics Agencies</I>, in order to demonstrate their
efficiency to their respective governments and parliamentarian
committees to acquire funds, recruit networks of unaware mules
with the complicity of drug barons as seen in cases in Britain
between 1983-1992. This method is used often when a certain agency
is in the process of making the demand for augmenting its budget
to fight consumption, drug abuse or trafficking. In this sort
of corruption, evidence is erased to protect the chain of drug-barons
who also work as informers and are often known to have political
or military clout in the producing or trafficking state. This,
in return, leads to an informal understanding permitting a certain
amount of drug trafficking in the consumer country. The USDEA
and the French anti-drug agency have also used such techniques.
The victims are recruited on a low percentage like a plane ticket
or hotel expenses. These mules are usually uneducated un-employed,
illiterates and those who simply are given a pocket or a suitcase
at the airport &quot;for a friend&quot;.
<P>
<B>It would be hard to counter such international mal-practices
and corruption among officials.</B> It is also necessary to develop
methods for an out-reach amongst the target-communities. Harsh
penalties have not stopped drug trafficking in states where capital
punishment is common. The difference between classes while planning
a communication or alternative strategies by officials also plays
an important role. The infrastructure of the constitution, administration,
bureaucracy, army, workers rights, human rights and economic policy
do not correspond to the native culture and ethics. In brief,
 a colonial structure which has been personalised on a country-to
-country basis becomes the main obstacle. This might require the
study of the local judicial system and social definitions organised
by councils (panchayat), jirga, fines, economic and barter practices.
<P>
This could only be made possible by establishing a communicator
between bodies' officials, district administrations and effected
groups. The economic gap in such countries has created a class
of experts with little field experience and very little knowledge
of regional, local and cross-border communication patterns. Even
if they are aware of such patterns, it is used against the will
of existing traditions. Traditions such as street theatres, folklore,
its concurrent interpretation and negligence of the social trends
needs to be corrected.
<H3>Strategies</H3>

<H4>Introduction</H4>

<P>
It is evident that <I>the colonial infrastructure cannot be abolished</I>
as this would mean the re-thickening of already existing regional
conflicts based on local, tribal, ethnic, sectorial and religious
norms. Several wars would be needed to settle these issues which
is not the purpose here. To formulate a comprehensive strategy,
it is imperative to devise subtle NGO workings, simplified communication
patterns and message-based economic ideas. This could be achieved
by the creation and use of the field groups to collect intelligence
which should be helpful in communicating the issues to the consumer
states. This would mean the dialogue at three levels: a) Between
the North and the South on an informal basis involving NGOs formed
on meagre resources and run by the local population, recommended
by the North-South field group; b) Between the government and
its functionaries to amend certain laws which only help in providing
large sums of financial assistance from donor agencies contributing
to the high level of corruption; c) To establish a simple communication
pattern already existent in regions between the above-categorised
NGOs to develop cooperation on a barter basis and to form larger
groups of jirga, panchayat and ethnic, caste and sectarian basis.
<H4>Local strategies</H4>

<P>
Such strategies would permit communities, groups and tribes to
start a dialogue, in return for controlled financial assistance
by the donor agencies thus eliminating the possibility of corruption.
These strategies would function through simple, small and controllable
NGOs formed in regions where linguistic dialects differ from one
region to another but the language remains the same. Several test
pilot projects should be envisaged on a controlled risk basis.
These NGOs, formed on recommendations by the North-South Centre,
should be controlled by the experienced and expert field staff
with higher degrees in international relations, ethnology, geopolitics,
micro-macro economic planning with Third World work experiences
in urban / rural transition areas. Students must be included as
part of the <B>alternative administration and communication strategy
training programme (AACTP).</B>
<H4>National level</H4>

<P>
This step could be considered difficult because of the prevalent
mistrust embedded in cultures of certain poverty-stricken regions.
To make things worse, these miseries are a lucrative exploitable
market for the federal, provincial governments and certain donor
agencies. In certain cases, the opposition to such ambitious projects
has come from the parliamentarians, police and the army who see
their zones of influence slipping away. To counter this, instead
of arm twisting through diplomatic effort, out reach is advised
by including in pilot projects members of low income groups from
the ruling tribe or area chief in order to allow cross-flow of
information / intelligence. A comprehensive communication plan
should be made available at the national level through the existing
infrastructure, maybe corrupt, of local government schemes launched
in the regions by the government on a need-to-know basis.
<H4>Regional strategies</H4>

<P>
Following the same infrastructure, a North-South Centre (NSC)
bureaux should be formed on a regional basis to study all social,
ethnic and religious differences existing in a cross-border format.
One example comes from India and Pakistan in a particular zone
of Kashmir which has been the cause of three wars between these
two countries. Another example is the differences between ethnic
Pashtoun and Uzbek identities in Afghanistan and Pakistan. To
achieve this, a maximised level of impartiality would have to
be maintained in order to let the population and the governments
themselves evaluate the staff involved in such projects.
<H4>International level</H4>

<P>
At this level, the North-South Centre is advised to circulate
inter-EU confidential memoranda in order to draw interest. Philanthropic
donor and human rights organisations / institutions are advised
to be contacted to form a protection blanket for pilot projects.
It is strongly advised to include in such projects 60% of women.

This International Conference will focus on the drugs issue from
a global interdependence perspective. It will have an important
educational, information and media component and will take an
integrated approach to this major cause of social disintegration.
The Conference will examine questions in a global interdependence
context and will culminate in policy and action proposals which
will take into account social and environmental objectives as
well as those concerning development and human rights.

<H3><A NAME="background">BACKGROUND</A></H3>

<P>
A number of factors have led to the organisation of this event,
namely:
<UL>
<LI>The North-South Centre's history of promoting an integrated
approach to North-South issues, its experience in fostering dialogue
among different partners and its effective awareness-raising activities
in Europe;
<LI>The Council of Europe Pompidou Group's history of adopting
a multidisciplinary approach to drugs and of playing a unique
role as natural intermediary between the various regional groupings
of countries in Europe;
<LI>The European Commission's meetings with policy-makers, scientists,
industry, NGOs, and others; its development of European policy
in this field and its establishment of the European Monitoring
Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA).
<LI>The European Parliament's debate on European drugs policy
and its expressed interest in organising an International Conference
to review drugs policies and programmes in a broader and integrated
context.
<LI>NGO interest in such a Conference and, in particular, the
interest shown by members of the European NGO Committee on Drugs
and Development as a forum for interaction with the European Commission,
the EMCDDA, the European Parliament, the Council of Europe and
relevant United Nations agencies.
</UL>
<HR>

<H3><A NAME="objective">OBJECTIVES</A></H3>

<UL>
<LI>To provide an overview of the various issues from different
perspectives (economics, development, environment, human rights,
etc.) with regard to the global interdependence dimension of the
drugs issue. This will add a new dimension to work developed to
date as it puts drugs in a wider international context. The Conference
will also introduce a new type of co-operation between a wider
variety of partners, given that it will involve the North-South
Centre's quadrilogue partners (governments, parliamentarians,
local authorities and NGOs) as well as the media. One of the key
elements for the success of the Conference will be the full participation
of partners from the South who will have the opportunity to put
forward their views and proposals.
<LI>To provide a meeting ground where key policy-makers, researchers,
local authorities and citizens' associations can debate present
and future policy options for Europe on the question of drugs
and development issues. The aim of the meeting is to outline concrete
policy options and proposals for implementation. It should be
action-oriented and aim to change the current reality. In order
to avoid duplication, it should take into consideration all the
work already undertaken by other organisations in this field.
<LI>To provide a framework for a more institutional relationship
between NGOs and international organisations on drugs issues.
The Conference could result in the strengthening of the European
NGO Committee on Drugs and Development as one of several vehicles
for collaboration between NGOs and the European Monitoring Centre
for Drugs and Drug Addiction, the Council of Europe and other
institutions.
<LI>To reinforce the policies of citizens' organisations in the
North (East and West) and in the South with the aim of improving
governmental and international drugs policies and addressing aspects
not covered by public organisations.
<LI>To seek ways to change the current reality, North and South,
East and West, through public information campaigns, educational
programmes, media coverage and appropriate environmental, development
and social programmes and projects.
</UL>
<HR>

<H3><A NAME="participation">PARTICIPATION</A></H3>

<P>
More than 100 participants from all over the world are expected
to attend the Conference. Participants will include:
<UL>
<LI>Local, national, regional and international policy-makers
and officials.
<LI>Citizens' associations (from both the North and the South)
including local organisations concerned with drugs supply or demand,
environment and development NGOs, representatives of indigenous
peoples, women's organisations, youth groups, consumers' associations,
trade unions, religious leaders, educators, etc.
<LI>Representatives of local indigenous peoples' groups in drug
producing areas.
<LI>Scientists and other experts in such fields as international
relations, micro- and macro-economics, agriculture, anthropology,
sociology, history, human rights, health and social issues, law,
etc.
<LI>Media representatives from both the North and the South.
</UL>
<HR>

<H3><A NAME="working">WORKING METHOD</A></H3>

<P>
This will be a working meeting with most of the proceedings taking
place in small working groups, designed to build upon the background
papers, refining policy proposals and developing action strategies.
The Conference will be organised over three days, with opening
and closing plenary sessions at which dignitaries will be invited
to speak.In a period leading up to the Conference distinguished
specialists from different backgrounds from the North and the
South have been asked to provide background papers on the issues
which will be debated during the Conference. Each paper concludes
with recommendations, including policy proposals directed towards
Europe. <BR>
The topics include local economics, trade and agriculture, debt
and structural adjustment, development aid, environment, new producers
and traders, control measures, education and media, international
conventions and information-sharing.<HR>

<H3><A NAME="output">OUTPUT</A></H3>

<P>
The key working group recommendations, including policy proposals,
will be compiled in a Summary Report to be forwarded to the Parliamentary
Assembly of the Council of Europe and to the European Parliament
as well as to all Member States of the Council of Europe. The
background papers, proceedings and outcome of the Conference will
be published in a Final Report for distribution to a wider audience
of concerned citizens and organisations with specific policy proposals
directed towards NGOs in the North (East and West) and in the
South.<HR>

<H3><A NAME="followup">FOLLOW-UP</A></H3>

<P>
Immediately after the Conference, a core group of participants
will begin planning an action strategy to promote the Conference
proposals among various target groups, including local, national,
regional and international policy-makers, industry, trade unions,
consumers' organisations and other citizens' associations especially
in Europe.<BR>
It is expected that, in addition to the policy approach, the Conference
will also result in practical proposals for information, media,
development, environmental, educational and social programmes,
and projects which can be implemented by various actors.<HR>

<P>
The European Centre for Global Interdependence and Solidarity
- the North-South Centre - of the Council of Europe opened its
doors in Lisbon in May 1990. The Centre was created on the basis
of a Partial Agreement of the Council of Europe with the aim of
raising public awareness of Europe's many relations and complex
inter-linkages with the other continents in a world where local
activities are rapidly assuming planetary dimensions.<BR>
<BR>
Although the Centre has member States, it is not run exclusively
as an intergovernmental operation. Instead, it functions on the
basis of a so-called &quot;quadrilogue&quot;, a unique system
of quadripartite management by parliamentarians, governments,
non-governmental organisations and local and regional authorities.
These four partners participate in the planning and implementation
of the Centre's programmes.<BR>
In order to attain its objectives, the Centre organises core projects
and partnership projects. Its activities are divided into the
following three programme &quot;windows&quot;: Public Information
and Media Relations, Education and Training for Global Interdependence,
Dialogue for Global Partnership.<BR>
 
<H3><A NAME="edrc">The Environment &amp; Development Resource
Centre</A></H3>

<P>
The Environment &amp; Development Research Centre is an international
non-profit association established in 1988. Membership consists
of individuals working on the interface between ecology and economics.
The purpose of the Centre is to promote global sustainable development
- in our view a development which is ecologically sound, socially
just and respectful of cultural diversity.<BR>
EDRC promotes co-operation between the environment and development
movements -North, South, East and West - as well as co-operation
between activists and researchers, between NGOs and the private
sector, and with policy makers.<BR>
Other activities of EDRC concern European environment and development
policies related to Amazonia, Africa, Asia and Central and Eastern
Europe as well as global NGO action organised as a follow-up to
the 1992 &quot;Earth Summit&quot;. EDRC also serves as the secretariat
for the European NGO Committee on Drugs and Development. <BR>

<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P>
On the illicit drugs front, the 1990s have been marked by two
phenomena: an explosion of production and trafficking in their
&quot;traditional&quot; areas and resultant contamination of new
regions, chiefly the territories of the former Communist countries
in Eastern Europe and the African countries south of the Sahara.
In both regions, these phenomena occur against a background of
political and economic upheaval whose salient feature is the establishment
of democratisation processes and ultra-liberal policies. While
action at the political level is difficult, at the economic level
a number of adjustments would avert the undesirable effects of
liberal policies on drug production and dealing.
<H3>The former Communist countries' role in the trade</H3>

<P>
The former communist countries, whose respective yields were once
intended for local consumption, have a tendency to be caught up
in international dealing: Kazakhstan for cannabis derivatives,
Tajikistan, Uzbekistan or Ukraine for opium poppy derivatives.
These two types of production, though expanding extremely rapidly,
have not yet attained significance on the world drug market. The
main changes in the trading processes in fact stem from the break-up
of the Soviet-dominated Eastern Bloc. The first effect is that
the confined space of the bloc, ruled by its own internal logic,
has been restored to a wide-open state both for the previous marketing
traditions and the new polarities of international commerce. Secondly,
tendencies towards completely unregulated trade practice have
been strongly accentuated by this sudden opening-up and by the
infirmity of economies and societies abruptly subjected to the
elementary laws of predation and survival. Furthermore, drug trafficking
as a quick source of capital gain and the interpenetrating arms
traffic which it finances revolve around the markets created by
war in the former Yugoslavia and conflict in the Caucasus and
Central Asia.
<P>
The Turkish organisations are present on the terminal portions
of these drug pipelines. Albanians from Kosovo and the Former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia are also active on the route through
the Balkans and the Italian Adriatic ports. Bulgaria and Romania
are transit points for the Turkish, Russian and Caucasian connections.
Turkish narcotics dealers are present not only along the older
Mediterranean routes dominated by the Italian Mafia, but also
the more independent new Balkan routes, the preserve of the Russians
and Caucasians. The Balkan trade has overland and seaborne variants
which are endlessly multiplied by the involvement of Lebanese
and Kurds to the South and Serbs and Croats to the North.
<H3>African drug growing and distribution</H3>

<P>
Cannabis, introduced into East and Central Africa as from the
14th century, did not reach most West African countries until
after World War II. In all parts its use was of a folk nature.
Deterioration of national economic situations in the 1970s and
remedial application of structural adjustment programmes in the
1980s brought rapid expansion of the crops. In many African countries
today, they represent the sole expedient enabling farmers to weather
the recession, especially as the local authorities turn a blind
eye or are implicated in the traffic. Certain countries - Nigeria,
Ghana, Ivory Coast, Senegal and others - supply the regional markets
and export increasing quantities of their production to Europe.
<P>
Since the early 1980s, Africa has also become a major transit
route (air and sea) for heroin being delivered from Southwest
and Southeast Asia to the USA and Europe, as well as cocaine from
America bound for Europe. The initial leadership of the Nigerian
rings has given way to a trend towards multinational structuring
of networks: Kenyans, Tanzanians, Zairians, Senegalese, etc. Although
the traffickers long preferred East African ports for transhipping
consignments, particularly hashish originating from Southeast
Asia, growing use of West African ports where customs officials
are very readily bribed is observed. It has also been noted that
the Moroccan traffickers use the coasts of the Cape Verde Islands
and Senegal, handy to the Spanish and North African coasts.
<H3>Alternative policies</H3>

<P>
Both regions of the world, though very different in many respects,
are affected by situations with a number of points in common which
account for the development of illicit activities.
<P>
1. Conflict situations in a number of countries: [Tajikistan,
Azerbaijan, Armenia, Chechnya, former Yugoslavia; Somalia, Rwanda,
Chad, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Senegal]. (See text on conflicts).
<P>
2. Elsewhere, it is the democratisation process which gives rise
to the illicit tradings. Indeed, the new democratic parties are
looking for alternative resources whether legal or illegal to
counter the old single parties which usually retain part of the
resources monopolised by the state structures [Russia, Georgia,
Ukraine, Romania, etc.; Mozambique, Guinea, Chad, Ivory Coast,
etc.].
<P>
3. All these countries are nevertheless alike in being under constraint
from the international financial organisations to accept economic
liberalisation policies: privatisation, application of structural
adjustment plans, etc. This is the level where it may well be
possible to act by making alterations in these policies which
would remedy their ill-effects:
<P>
a) privatisation: ensure that it is not carried out through laundering
of mafia money [East Germany, Russia, Bulgaria, Romania, etc].
<P>
b) ensure that branches of European banks in these countries do
not take advantage of their location to engage in practices forbidden
them in the West [Hungary].
<P>
c) possible proposals for agricultural policy:
<P>
giving poor farmers access to production resources subsidised
by means of inexpensive loans;
<P>
maintaining arable acreage and safeguarding land tenure;
<P>
hedging the prices of local produce against imports;
<P>
guarding against fluctuations in world rates for exported agricultural
products;
<P>
diversifying revenue sources by diversifying agricultural and
non-agricultural activities;
<P>
founding agricultural organisations which are not empty shells
that merely act as political relays but can form real countervailing
powers which give farmers a firmer footing on which to negotiate.
<P>
Needless to say, all these proposals run counter to the policy
laid down by the World Bank and the international finance bodies.

<H3>''New Producers and Traders: The Emergence of New Criminal
Organisations, particularly in Central and Eastern Europe''</H3>

<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P>
One of the more remarkable aspects of the expansion of the drug
trade has been the spread of addiction and the drug economy to
the Third World and to the former socialist countries in Central
and Eastern Europe. In my paper, I am going to concentrate on
the latter region.
<P>
Drug abuse has been a fact of life in Eastern and Central Europe
since the late 1960's, but although illegal drug abuse is far
from uncommon, illegal trafficking and organised crime have yet
to take hold.
<P>
Before speaking about the new producers, traders and consumers,
let me take a brief look at the old ones, I mean, the drug-scene
during the socialist period.
<P>
In that time, the main features of the drug problem were the following:
owing to the nature of the economy (planned economy run by the
state), the political system (one-party state) and the strict
social control of every day life, the drug trade to fulfil the
demand of the market had not been formed. Drug trafficking was
small, the 'real drugs' (such as opium, heroin, cocaine, and cannabis
derivatives) were missing and the drug problem was not linked
to criminality. (For example, in Hungary, the wide- spread form
of drug abuse was 'glue-sniffing'). We could say the drug problem,
particularly the demand for drugs, had already started in Central
and Eastern Europe during the socialist period. I think the most
important finding of that time is that drug abuse in a society
can come to exist without the supply of 'real' drugs.
<P>
The above-mentioned features of the drug scene in the region have
changed since the collapse of the former regime. Today, all elements
of the drug problem in the Western countries are present in the
countries in question. Thus, for example, illicit trafficking
to meet the domestic demand has started and there has been an
attempt to produce home-made drugs. There is an extremely wide
variety of illegal drugs available, and money-laundering actions
related to the illegal drug business have appeared in Central
and Eastern Europe. However, I must add that 'Central and Eastern
Europe' is just a geographical and political common name for a
territory. In this territory, there are many countries with the
same social difficulties, but with many differences from the point
of view of culture, development, and the facts of social life,
like the drug problem, Let us examine a few examples of the common
features and differences in the field of the drug problem, which
in addition, illustrate the new producers and the new criminal
organisations.
<P>
According to the official figures, the number of drug consumers
is 1.5 million in Russia. In Moscow, you can get all kinds of
drugs. The narcotics Mafia of organised drug sellers and buyers
have controlled over-trafficking in the country. The estimated
income of the Mafia was more than 0.5 billion dollars in 1995.
''Cannabis sativa'' has grown to roughly 1 million hectares, for
producing marijuana (about 1 million tons per year). For Colombian
cocaine cartels, the target country, or at least the distributive
country, is Russia. The law enforcement agencies have discovered
two university laboratories which manufactured synthetic drugs
for the Mafia. 
<P>
In Hungary, we have had another kind of problem. Although the
number of consumers has been increasing (their number is about
25-30,000), our country is mainly a way station for the movement
of drugs, given that its borders are no longer secure. The other
reason: the so-called Balkan-route, that is, the route of smuggling
heroin from South-Eastern Asia to Western Europe, has been transferred
to Northern countries so that Hungary (and the Czech and the Slovak
Republics) have become the predominant transit countries for drug
trafficking. (In Hungary, less than 4 kg heroin, 2.5 kg hashish
were seized in 1990, while in 1995 more than 500 kg heroin and
also more than 500 kg hashish were seized). The territorial monopoly
of the Balkan-route belongs to the Mafia's in Turkey, and the
Albanian Mafia's are also quite involved in the illicit drug smuggling
that is crossing Hungary. Further new features of the drug trafficking
and producing in Hungary: the production of amphetamines in illegal
laboratories, or in an illicit way, to transport to the Netherlands
and Sweden, ''cannabis tours'' to the Netherlands, domestic production
of cannabis, cocaine trafficking headed by a Nigerian network,
and newer drugs on the market are amphetamine derivatives (i.e.
metaphetamin: Ecstasy-pill).
<P>
By the mid-nineties, illicit drug trafficking, which is a part
of international organised crime, had reached Hungary. Hungarian
citizens are involved in this business. So far, national organised
crime has appeared in different territories mainly in the field
of tourism, trafficking in foreign currencies, prostitution, theft
of cars, and smuggling people. Hungarian and foreign dealers sell
drugs on the domestic market. Distribution of drugs ordinarily
takes place indoors, particularly in restaurants; very few sales
occur on the street.
<P>
The situation is basically the same in the Czech and Slovak Republics
and Poland as in Hungary, with the difference that, in the latter,
synthetic drugs (mainly amphetamines), are produced in large quantities
to be smuggled in Scandinavia.
<H3>Drug policy issues</H3>

<P>
Central and Eastern European countries have joined the UN Conventions
on the drug issue (1961, 1974) and have ratified the UN Covenant
of 1988 Against Illicit Traffic on Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic
Substances. In addition to the mentioned international conventions,
these countries have taken into account the documents of the Council
of Europe, when forming their drug policy. For example, when Hungary
modified the articles on the Criminal Code concerning the drug
problem in 1993, the experts who prepared the Bill took into consideration
Recommendation n&#186;1085 of the 40th Plenary Session of the
Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. Based upon the
mentioned international and regional documents, the goal of the
drug policies of these countries is ''harm reduction'', and they
implement the ''double strategy'' in criminal law. It means there
are huge differences between the severity of punishment of the
consumer and the trafficker.
<P>
What is the impact of this policy in the region? First of all,
the drug problem is treated as a legal issue, which could be controlled
mainly by means of criminal law. Because of this feature, the
law enforcement agencies have had the central role in the drug
policy in Central and Eastern Europe. Among the total number of
criminals, are an increasing number of drug offenders, particularly
traffickers. (For example, in Hungary, the number of registered
offenders was 37 in 1990, and 324 in 1994). In spite of the fact
that, on the one side, most of the consumers belong to disadvantaged
social groups, and on the other side, drug trafficking is good
business, the drug policy of these countries has neglected the
social policy and economic aspects of the drug problem.
<H3>Alternative policies and practices</H3>

<P>
If we are looking for alternative policies, we should take into
consideration the actual social and economic process in the region,
namely the privatisations of the economy and the social consequences
of this process. These countries do not have enough financial
resources and capital for privatising the economy. The governments
make efforts to cut the social policy budget in order to obtain
resources to revitalise the economy.
<P>
Certain groups of individuals, who do not have the necessary financial
resources either to become legal participants in the business
life, join in the ''black economy'', of which drug trafficking
is a very fruitful field. Both efforts have influence on the drug
problem. If we take into consideration the above-mentioned processes
and the results of the latest general elections in these countries,
we have to understand: these countries need financial sources
to revitalise the legal economy and to ensure money for social
policy and welfare is available, because one of the most important
values for their citizens is the right to social security.
<P>
Alternative policy should mean an alternative international finance
policy which should respect the above-mentioned situation and
value of the given region. 
<H3>Recommendations </H3>

<P>
Today, we do not have a comprehensive and real picture of the
drug problem in Central and Eastern Europe. For this reason, the
fundamental recommendation is that we should carry out a comparative
epidemiological, criminological, and legal research on this issue.
<P>
International NGOs should monitor and evaluate the loan and credit
policy of the international organisations.
<P>
Local NGOs should monitor the features of the ''black market''
organised crime, and the relationship between these social facts
and the tendency of the drug problem, as well as the legal regulations
in relation to these issues.

<H3>''Global Debt and the Criminalisation of Economic Activity''
</H3>

<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P>
Global debt has favoured the rapid growth of illicit trade and
the criminalisation of economic activity on a world scale. Globalisation
is marked by a parallel process of &quot;internationalisation
of the criminal economy&quot;. The national mafias increasingly
operate as transnational business entities within the global marketplace.
There is ample evidence of expanded levels of &quot;business transactions&quot;
and exchange between the various criminal organisations. Moreover,
a significant part of this criminal economy is fully integrated
into the workings of international banking and finance.
<P>
There are several, and often contradictory, estimates pertaining
to the size of the criminal economy. A recent estimate of the
United Nations suggests that total worldwide revenues of transnational
criminal organisations (TCOs) are of the order of one trillion
dollars representing an amount equivalent to the combined GDP
of the group of low income countries (with a combined population
of 3 billion people). The United Nations estimate includes the
trade in narcotics, arms sales, etc. as well as the earnings derived
from the mafia controlled services economy (eg. prostitution,
hotels, gambling, exchange banks, etc.). What these estimates
do not adequately convey is the magnitude of routine investments
by the criminal mafias in &quot;legal&quot; business ventures.
<H3>The Role of Economic Restructuring</H3>

<P>
The evidence confirms that the macro-economic reforms imposed
by external creditors on developing countries have been conducive
to a weakening of both the export sector and the internal market.
In turn, the crisis affecting the <I>&quot;legal economy&quot;</I>
has created an environment which favours the rapid development
of illicit production and trade.  In other words, the vacuum created
in the legal economy and the consequent collapse in the standard
of living tends to encourage, in many developing countries, the
concurrent development of an <I>&quot;alternative economy&quot;</I>
based on the narcotics trade and a growing number of illicit activities.
In many countries in the Third World and in the former Eastern
bloc, export and domestic markets collapse simultaneously creating
a situation where illicit production becomes the dominant &quot;leading&quot;
sector as well as the main source of foreign exchange.
<H3>The Reforms in International Banking</H3>

<P>
This restructuring of the real economy (at national and world
levels) is also accompanied by profound changes in the global
monetary system. National and global patterns of economic growth
are conditioned by the internationalisation of macro-economic
reform. The latter are not only conducive to the restructuring
of the real economy, they also favour the removal of barriers
to the movement of money within the international banking system.
<P>
The reforms of international currency markets (including the development
of electronic transfers and the deregulation of foreign exchange
markets) tend to facilitate the circulation and recycling of &quot;dirty
money&quot; in the international banking system. Major international
commercial banks not only constitute an outlet for money laundering,
they also provide credit to the agents of illegal trade (often
to the detriment of legal agriculture and manufacturing).
<P>
Offshore banking and the global laundering of dirty money have
become inherent features of the international banking system.
At the global economic level, the evidence suggests that legal
and illegal business activities are increasingly interlocked.
 Illicit trade permeates the fabric of normal financial and business
operations as well as the organs of State power. The evidence
would suggest that the economic mafias also exercise control over
major banking interests.
<P>
Conversely, legal business activities invest in the criminal economy
through the acquisition of banks, commercial companies, etc. which
are involved in the laundering of dirty money and/or have business
linkages to criminal organisations. The process operates in both
directions: criminal organisations (eg. with interests in the
narco-economy) acquire banking and productive assets in the legal
economy; conversely legal economic and financial interests have
a financial stake in the illicit economy.
<P>
The foregoing process also affects the structure of the national
State: prominent political figures and senior officials in national
governments have ties of allegiance to criminal organisations.
There is, in this context, a consequent &quot;distortion&quot;
in political structures and social relations which has a direct
bearing on policy formulation by national governments, including
the articulation of macro-economic and financial reforms. Criminal
organisations involved in illicit trade increasingly constitute
a powerful undercover lobby operating both at the national and
international levels influencing the scope and direction of government
policy.
<H3>Offshore Banking</H3>

<P>
Offshore banking shields corporations from taxation and provides
a safe-haven for the laundering of dirty money 1. The banking
havens are not limited to the many tropical island republics,
offshore facilities are now firmly established within the boundaries
of the European Union: Luxembourg, the Channel Islands, Dublin,
Madeira and Gibraltar. The offshore havens are an appendage of
the Western Banking system.  With deregulation, they have become
an integral part of the workings of the global financial marketplace
2. The magnitude of offshore banking is overwhelming. The Cayman
Islands constitutes the fifth largest banking centre in the world
with more banks and registered trust companies than the number
of its inhabitants 3.
<P>
Vast amounts of <I>&quot;black money&quot;</I> (namely money which
has escaped taxation) can be moved rapidly through electronic
transfer from one offshore safe haven to the next.  Corporations
can also use the banking havens to <I>&quot;recycle their profits&quot;</I>
towards a variety of business activities including speculative
investments and <I>&quot;hot money deposits&quot;</I> in the &quot;emerging
financial markets&quot; of south-east Asia and Eastern Europe.
 Large amounts of dirty and black money are channelled towards
the purchase of State assets in the so-called &quot;countries
in transition&quot;. The purchase of large amounts of government
debt in the form of bonds and securities is also transacted directly
from the island havens. The island safe havens have also been
extensively used by criminal organisations to launder <I>&quot;dirty
money&quot;</I> including the proceeds of the drug trade. <I>&quot;Dirty
money&quot;</I> - which routinely transits through the island
havens - is in turn converted into <I>&quot;clean money&quot;</I>
enabling the criminal mafias to acquire control over banking and
productive assets in the &quot;legal economy&quot;. Conversely,
the billions of dollars of <I>&quot;dirty money&quot;</I> deposited
in bank accounts (by these criminal organisations) enable the
&quot;legal&quot; banking system to considerably expand its lending
activities including the purchase of government bonds, which signifies
that the public debt is also financed by the proceeds of illegal
trade...
<P>
Moreover, with electronic transfers, the nature of money has changed.
Money becomes an intangible which moves at high speed within the
system. The rapid circulation and internationalisation of money
movements is an essential feature of the evolving World monetary
system. These innovations in banking also contribute to enlarging
the activities of money laundering. The convenience and speed
at which dirty money transactions can be undertaken tend to facilitate
the development of illicit trade and the narcotics economy.
<H3>The Role of Macro-Economic Reform</H3>

<P>
The restructuring of the real economy is paramount to an understanding
of the growth of illicit trade. Since the early 1980s, the <I>&quot;macro-economic
stabilisation&quot;</I> and <I>&quot;structural adjustment&quot;</I>
programmes imposed by the IMF and the World Bank on developing
countries (as a condition for the renegotiation of their external
debt) have led to the impoverishment of hundreds of millions of
people. Contrary to the spirit of the Bretton Woods agreement
which was predicated on &quot;economic reconstruction&quot; and
stability of major exchange rates, the structural adjustment programme
has largely contributed to destabilising national currencies and
ruining the economies of developing countries.  Internal purchasing
power has collapsed, famines have erupted, health clinics and
schools have been closed down, etc. These conditions have in turn
favoured the development of illicit trade and the criminalisation
of economic activity.
<P>
In the case of Peru and Bolivia, for instance, the IMF sponsored
reforms have contributed to undermining the role of legal commodity
exports while providing a boost to the narcotics economy. In Bolivia,
the 1985 IMF-sponsored macro-economic stabilisation programme
was conducive to the collapse of mineral exports and the restructuring
of the mining economy. The reorganisation of the state mining
consortium COMIBOL had a direct impact on the development of the
illegal coca economy: severance payments to redundant miners were
invested in the acquisition of land in the coca producing areas
by workers who had been laid off to the extent that both capital
and labour were redirected towards the coca economy.
<P>
In Peru, the development of the narco-economy under President
Alberto Fujimori also bears an intimate relationship to the conduct
of macro-economic policy: the August 1990 economic shock created
the conditions for the further growth of the drug trade.  First,
the contraction of internal demand coupled with the lifting of
tariffs on imported food staples, contributed to a serious recession
in agricultural production.
<H3>Macro-economic Reform and Illicit Trade in the Eastern Block
Countries</H3>

<P>
Since the late 1980s, the IMF-World Bank &quot;economic medicine&quot;
has been imposed on Eastern Europe, Yugoslavia and the former
Soviet Union with devastating economic and social consequences.
Also of significance is the extent to which the economic measures
in the former Soviet Union contribute to destroying civil society
and distorting fundamental social relations: the criminalisation
of economic activity, the looting of State property, money laundering
and capital flight are bolstered by the reforms. Dirty and black
money from offshore havens are recycled towards the acquisition
of State assets in the former Soviet Union. Luxembourg and the
British Virgin Islands are respectively ranked third and fourth
among &quot;foreign investors&quot; in the Russian Federation...
4
<P>
In other words, the privatisation programme (through the public
auction of State enterprises) favours the transfer of a significant
portion of State property to organised crime. The latter permeates
the State apparatus and constitutes a powerful lobby broadly supportive
of Yeltsin's economic reforms. According to a recent estimate,
half of Russia's commercial banks are under the control of the
local mafias, and half of the commercial real estate in central
Moscow is in the hands of organised crime. 5
<H3>The Real Economy: The Shift from Legal to Illicit Production
</H3>

<P>
While the legal commodity economy declines as a result of the
macro-economic reforms, illegal commodity exports are expected
to play an expanded role in generating the revenues required to
service the external debt. The creditors do not distinguish between
clean and dirty money. The recycling of dirty money towards debt
servicing is a necessary consequence of the weakening of the legal
economy and the incapacity of developing countries to service
their debt from shrinking export revenues.  Various institutional
mechanisms which favour the recycling of dirty and black money
towards debt servicing have been established by national governments.
The repatriation of capital flight to meet debt servicing obligations
is encouraged by the Bretton Wood institutions.
<P>
The application of the IMF economic reforms tends to further depress
world commodity prices because they force individual countries
to simultaneously gear their national economies towards a shrinking
world market thereby creating a situation of oversupply on world
markets. In turn, the dollarisation of input prices, the reforms
in the structures of credit to agriculture and manufacturing further
exacerbates the decline in the real economy.
<P>
World prices collapse for legal primary commodity exports in a
global economy characterised by surplus output. In turn, &quot;alternative&quot;
exports unfold within the spheres of the illicit economy. With
legal commodity prices plummeting, illicit trade and the narco-economy
often become the main source of the country's foreign exchange.
<H3>The Collapse of the Internal Market</H3>

<P>
The collapse of the legal domestic manufacturing and agriculture
(for the internal market) including the informal sector is engineered
through the liberalisation of trade and the lifting of tariff
barriers. Trade liberalisation destabilises internal markets and
undermines domestic production geared towards the internal market.
The dumping of food surpluses in Sub-Saharan Africa, for instance,
has contributed to the demise of food farming and livestock production
for the local market. The latter are replaced by imports from
the European Community and North America. The development of illegal
production results from the displacement of food agriculture.
<P>
Two processes are taking place concurrently: exports collapse
and the internal production for the domestic market is replaced
by imports. In the extreme case, the restructuring process leads
to the collapse of the entire legal economy. Legal exports are
replaced by illicit trade and imported consumer goods replace
goods produced by domestic producers. Namely, the national economy
is reduced to illicit production, in turn, the latter becomes
the main source of foreign exchange which funds debt servicing
and imports. In many developing countries, illicit production
has become the dominant activity overshadowing the legal economy
and replacing legal exports.

<I><B>INTRODUCTION</B></I>
<P>
Following decades of rapid technological development, information
technology (IT) enters into a new phase of growing applications
in most areas of human life. The lower cost and increasing performance
of hardware, as well as the power and easy use of software, have
all come together in a way that will fundamentally alter the way
most people live and work. 
<P>
Diplomacy like many other human activities is profoundly transformed.
Moreover, since the key ingredients of diplomacy - <B>information
</B> and <B>interaction </B>- are nowadays highly automated through
digitalization and networking, the changes in diplomacy is even
more substantial. The development of IT will compel diplomats:
<UL>
<LI>to work in <I>the new social,  political and economic environment
</I>characterized by the changes in the concept of sovereignty,
the emergence of the global economy and global information infrastructure;
<LI>to deal with  <I>new topics</I>  such as protection of intellectual
property on a multilateral and bilateral level, and 
<LI>to use <I>the new tools </I>made available by information
technology, such as automation of office activities, global networking,
 etc..
</UL>

<P>

<P>
These three areas of the interaction between diplomacy and  information
technology are the  conceptual foundation of the Unit for Computer
Applications in Diplomacy.  The Unit's Programme for 1995 focuses
on the following major activities:
<UL>
<LI>Course in Diplomacy and Information Technology
<LI>Research Projects on Diplomacy and Information Technology
<LI>Application Development and Electronic Publishing for Diplomacy

<P>
<I>PART I</I>
<P>
<I><B>COURSE IN DIPLOMACY AND INFORMATION </B></I>
<P>
<I><B>TECHNOLOGY</B></I>
<P>
The Course is based on the comprehensive and interdisciplinary
approach to information technology and diplomacy.  Beside providing
training in the use of the computer as a working tool,  the Course
focuses also on various issues raised through the use of information
technology. Thus the main objective of the Course is to provide
participants with proper conceptual and methodological skills
for working in the new international environment which is shaped,
to a large extent, by information technology.
<P>
The Course is divided into the following three areas:
<OL>
<LI>New political, social and economic environment for diplomatic
activities;
<LI>New topics on diplomatic agendas;
<LI>New tools for diplomats.
</OL>

<P>
<I>1</I><HR>

<P>
<I><B>NEW POLITICAL, SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT FOR DIPLOMATIC
ACTIVITIES</B></I>
<P>
The development of  IT  has made the modern world increasingly
interdependent and interconnected. Today's trends and characteristics,
which are likely to endure, will bring about deep changes of economic,
political and social structures in nation states as well as in
international relations.  The impact of these changes on diplomacy
is in the focus of this part of the Course.
<P>
<I>IT AND CHANGES IN MODERN SOCIETY</I>
<P>
The key question:<I><B> How will IT affect the way people live,
work and learn?</B></I>
<P>
Diplomats should have an understanding of the profound changes
in the production processes, and social structure. They  should
also be aware of conceptual  frameworks and tools for  the analysis
of the modern world. These issues are analyzed in proper economic,
political, philosophical and sociological perspectives. The main
schools of thought explaining these phenomenon is presented and
reviewed.
<P>
<I>IT AND SOVEREIGNTY</I>
<P>
The key question: <I><B>To  what extent will the development of
IT  affect the ability of states to assert their sovereignty in
the international arena and over their national destiny? </B>
</I>
<P>
Diplomacy is directly affected by the changes in the concept of
sovereignty. One of the main function of traditional diplomacy
has been to protect the sovereignty of states. Is this going to
remain the main function of diplomacy? Given that sovereignty,
the key element of state, has been seriously challenged by modern
processes, it is necessary to provide diplomats with a general
understanding of these processes as well as of the future of diplomacy
in new constellation of power. 
<P>
<I>2</I><HR>

<P>
<I>IT AND INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS (CONCEPT OF POWER</I><B>)</B>
<P>
The key question: <I><B>Is it likely that &quot;provinces&quot;
and &quot;backwaters&quot; in the forthcoming period will not
be countries with geographical disadvantages, but countries without
access to the networks, or, for instance, with IT-illiterate elites?
</B></I> 
<P>
Professional education of diplomats and foreign-policy decision
makers has been based on the traditional approaches to international
relations (e.g. realist and idealist). The main purpose of this
module of the Course is to provide some alternative approaches
and to bring the diplomats' attention to new perspectives of analyzing
international relations.  Special emphasis is paid to the importance
of geographical elements  in international relations.  It is likely
that the predominant determinant of a country's economic and overall
success is, among others, the skills in managing information and
data instead of controlling territory or important geographical
locations like it used to be during the history of mankind.<B>
</B>
<P>
<I>IT AND CULTURAL DIVERSITY</I>
<P>
The key question: <I><B>How will the growing movement of information
in digital form across national borders affect cultural, religious
and other values. Is Huntington's clash of civilization going
to happen in cyber-space? What should be the function of diplomacy
in this respect?</B></I>
<P>
Artifacts in digital form imposes a new form of communication
between individuals within the society as well as between societies.
IT will endanger traditional means for protection and promotion
of national culture and, at the same time, create new ones. The
special importance to this question is in multi-cultural societies
and regions (the Mediterranean), where the issue of the protection
of national cultures has a high political importance.
<P>
<I>3</I><HR>

<P>
<I>IT AND INTERNATIONAL ECONOMY</I>
<P>
<I>The key question</I>:  <I><B>How will the transition from a
commerce/industry economy towards an &quot;information economy&quot;
influence the diplomats'  task to promote the economic interests
of their countries?</B></I>
<P>
Classical economic theory and practice was build upon commerce/industry
economy. &quot;Information economy&quot; will require a new theoretical
and practical framework The features of this new framework are
in the focus of  this part of our Course. 
<P>
<I><B>NEW TOPICS ON DIPLOMATIC AGENDAS</B></I>
<P>
The growing centrality of IT-issues in international relations
has raised new and complex topics for diplomats and foreign policymakers.
Information Technology, which already takes a huge share of economic
transactions, requires proper international legal and political
framework.  Creating this framework, both on bilateral and multilateral
level, is one of the major tasks of diplomats.  In order to perform
this important function, diplomats should have a broad knowledge
of the various aspects of IT-related issues from a technological,
economic and legal point of view.
<P>
<I>IT COMMODITIES AND SERVICES</I>
<P>
The key question: <I><B>What are the most important IT commodities
and services? What are their major characteristics?</B></I>
<P>
The major aim of this part of the Course is to provide the basic
knowledge of IT commodities and services with special emphasize
on those that have or will have high importance in international
trade. The brief survey of major IT commodities and services is
provided, with special consideration of the protection of software.
 As far as software is concerned the special attention is paid
on various components of the protection of software such as: source
code, operation systems, compilers, executable elements of software,
etc.
<P>
<I>INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS, FORUMS AND CHANNELS FOR REGULATION
IT-RELATED ISSUES</I>
<P>
The key question: <I><B>What are the major international organizations,
forums and channels for discussing and regulating IT-related issues?
</B></I>
<P>
This part focuses on  international institutional framework for
regulating IT-issues. The survey will start with the established
international organizations and forums such as International Telecommunication
UNION (ITU), The World Telecommunication Forum, International
Standard Organization (ISO), American National Standards Institute
(ANSI), European Computer Manufacturers' Association (ECMA), etc.
It will also consider existence of the number of important NGOs,
such as  Electronic Frontier Foundation.
<P>
<I>TRANSFER OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY</I>
<P>
The key question<B>:</B><I> What are the various channels for
the transfer of IT from developed to developing countries?</I>
<P>
Transfer of technology, including IT, is one of the core topics
of the modern international economy. It has special importance
for north-south relations, development, etc. The major task of
this part of Course is to make a survey on the current policy
of transfer of technology and to identify all those aspect which
have a special importance for diplomacy and international relations.
Special emphasize is given to GATT activities and the newly-established
 WTO (World Trade Organization).
<P>
<I>PROTECTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IN BILATERAL </I>
<P>
<I>RELATIONS (SPECIAL EMPHASIS ON SOFTWARE)</I>
<P>
The key question: <I><B>What are the methods used for the protection
of software in bilateral relations between states? </B></I>
<P>
Analysis of the current practice of the United States and other
developed countries in this respect is provided. Special emphasis
is placed  on the position of developing countries in their attempts
with developed countries to enable bilateral protection of software.
 The problem of linking bilateral protection of software to the
transfer of technology is also addressed
<P>
<I>PROTECTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IN MULTILATERAL </I>
<P>
<I>CONTEXT (SPECIAL EMPHASIS ON SOFTWARE)</I>
<P>
The key question: <I><B>What are the safeguards used for the protection
of software in the available multilateral mechanisms (e.g. GATT,
World Intellectual Property Organization, EU, etc.). </B></I>
<P>
The Uruguay Round of GATT and  the formation of the World Trade
Organization is taken as a case study on multilateral protection
of software.  Positions of developed and developing countries
with regards to the protection of intellectual property is tackled
with special considerations on the  pros and cons for certain
forms of protection of intellectual property.
<P>
<I>OTHER  INTERNATIONAL LEGAL AND POLITICAL TOPICS RAISED BY THE
DEVELOPMENT OF IT</I>
<P>
Besides  the above mentioned topics the development of IT will
bring a number of a new issues that should be tackled on the international
level (e.g. transboundary disputes related to IT, protection of
privacy, limiting of free communication in the interest of international
public order, etc. )
<P>
<I>7</I><HR>

<P>
<I><B>NEW TOOLS FOR DIPLOMATIC ACTIVITIES</B></I>
<P>
Today, computers are more widely available to a large community
of users due to its lower cost. In diplomatic circles, the use
of computers was the privilege of the most developed countries.
Now, the use of computers in diplomacy can be afforded by any
country. Moreover, small States and other countries with limited
economic means for running their foreign affairs will find computers
a real necessity.
<P>
This part of the Course considers the practical use of computers
in conducting diplomatic activities. It focuses on  the use of
computer technology for:
<UL>

<I>PART III</I>
<P>
<I><B>RESEARCH ON DIPLOMACY AND INFORMATION</B></I>
<P>
<I><B>TECHNOLOGY</B></I>
<P>
Research projects  are directed towards exploring the dynamic
interaction between diplomacy and IT. They are interlinked with
the Course in Diplomacy and IT and developing applications for
diplomacy. The major focus in this period is on the following
two research projects:
<P>
<I>CREATING THE MODEL FOR THE COMPUTERISATION OF MINISTRIES OF
FOREIGN AFFAIRS</I>
<P>
The Model of the Computerization of Ministries of Foreign Affairs
is based on the analysis of diplomatic activities and their adaptation
to information technology. The  knowledge and experience developed
for business information systems are suited  to the needs of diplomatic
activities. Model focuses on:
<UL>
<LI>the automation of traditional methods of performing diplomatic
functions; and
<LI>the re-engineering of traditional diplomatic procedures when
it is possible. 
</UL>

<P>

<P>
Major parts of this Model are:
<UL>
<LI>automation of routine and repetitive activities
<LI>supply of data and information
<LI>automation of knowledge-intensive activities; and
<LI>human resource building
</UL>

<P>

<P>
The Model provides a general framework that could be  adjusted
to the particular needs of Ministries of Foreign Affairs and other
institutions involved in performing diplomatic activities.
<P>
<I>THE IMPACT OF TECHNOLOGY ON INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS</I>
<P>
This research project which is still in initial phase should tackle
the following issues:
<UL>
<LI>the increasing integration and disintegration of the international
system - a highly paradoxical environment
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>the impact of information technology and real-time access
to information on the international system;
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>the increased importance of networking netweing for new systems
of governance
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>the emergence of a new moral order from the transcendence
of the environment-development paradox
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>integration theory and neo-functionalism as a theoretical
framework for analysing the role of networks in international
relations.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
<I>PART III</I>
<P>
<I><B>APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT AND ELECTRONIC PUBLISHING FOR DIPLOMACY
</B></I>
<P>
One of the major objectives of the Unit for Computer Applications
in Diplomacy is to create tools that will help diplomats in their
training and performing diplomatic functions. Based on these starting
points the Unit developed the following applications:
<P>
<I>DATABASE OF INTERNATIONAL LAW</I>
<P>
The main motto in creating this database has been the need to
have a complete coverage of international legal rules, starting
from their adoption on the international level to their implementation
in relations among/between states or within states. Thus each
international legal instrument (convention, treaty) in the Database
has:
<UL>
<LI>basic information (title, date of acceptance, place of acceptance,
etc.);
<LI>full text;
<LI>list of countries that signed and/or ratified particular instrument
with texts of reservations, declarations, notifications, etc.;
<LI>indication of implementation of the instrument within the
internal legal system (solutions for both, monistic and dualistic
legal systems);
<LI>theoretical explanations for political and legal concepts
used in instruments;
</UL>

<P>

<P>
Technically speaking this application uses database and hypertext
technology. The current version of Database has 2000 international
legal instruments.<HR>

<P>
<I>15</I><HR>

<P>
<I>COMPUTER-ASSISTED LEARNING (CAL) COURSE IN DIPLOMACY </I>
<P>
CAL Course in Diplomacy is developed in order to support the teaching
of Diplomacy at the Mediterranean Academy of Diplomatic Studies.
It uses hypermedia technology for presenting teaching material.
 This application will be further developed in order to become
a self-contained Computer-based course in Diplomacy.
<P>
<I>COMPUTER-ASSISTED LEARNING (CAL) COURSE IN DIPLOMACY &amp;
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY</I>
<P>
It is considered appropriate to have the Course on Diplomacy and
IT taught by using new tools made available by IT. Consequently
the application for the support of this course has been developed.

</H3>

<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P>
Drug trafficking has existed in Andean countries, particularly
in Peru, for a quarter of a century.  From the outset, in the
1970s, the illegal drug economy using the coca leaf as its raw
material, has had a devastating effect on the legal economy, social
and cultural organisation, politics, the environment and ecology.
<P>
In the specific case of Peru, the illegal coca economy has been
and still is linked to guerilla movements such as the Sendero
Luminoso (Shining Path) and the MRTA (Tupac Amaru Revolutionary
Movement).  This illegal activity has also infiltrated the armed
forces and the police, which are supposed to be fighting it.
This considerable economic force, which injects an average of
one billion dollars every year (30% of Peru's exports) into the
Peruvian economy, distorts the economic process in the region.
<P>
The effect on the environment and regional ecology is very negative.
 Peru, the world's leading producer of coca leaves, with roughly
300,000 hectares of plantations, has had to clear more than one
million hectares of rainforest in the tropical region of the Amazon,
where coca plants are grown on natural terraces between 600 and
1500 metres above sea-level.  The damage caused by this deforestation
is not confined to erosion and impoverishment of tropical soil
but includes also a progressive and rapid depletion of biodiversity.
<P>
There is also very extensive contamination of rivers and soil.
 The engineer Buenaventura Marcelo Tadeo calculated that in order
to process the production from 160,000 hectares of coca plants
(yielding an average of 2,400 kilos per hectare per year), in
1987 alone, 57 million litres of kerosene, 32 million litres of
sulphuric acid, 16,000 tonnes of quicklime, 3,200 tonnes of carbide,
16,000 tonnes of toilet paper, 6,400,000 litres of acetone and
a similar amount of toluene were needed.  All these chemical wastes
are dumped into the rivers and lakes of the Amazon valley and
are extremely harmful to wildlife and human health.
<H3>Regional, national and international policies</H3>

<P>
Unfortunately, national and international policies are not working
on a global solution to the problem of drug trafficking.
<P>
United States' government policy, particularly since the Republicans
took control of Congress in December 1994, has concentrated on
a strategy to eradicate coca, marijuana and opium poppy plantations,
and has ignored the economic and social parameters of the problem.
<P>
This pressure to eradicate plantations has tended to militarise
the drugs war, which, in turn, has eroded the democratic foundations
of Andean countries and brought about increased corruption in
state structures and frequent human rights abuses in the region.
<P>
International macro-economic policies, structural adjustment programmes
and the unbridled application of the neo-liberal model have served
to stimulate the illegal economies in Andean countries.  In Peru,
Bolivia and Colombia the expansion of coca, opium poppy and marijuana
cultivation is directly linked to the opening up of the free market,
the decrease in customs tariffs and the protectionism of the North.
 The prices of legal crops such as rice, maize and others have
fallen because of unfair competition from imported produce.  This
has forced farmers into illegal activities.
<P>
Since the second half of 1995, coca leaf prices have fallen in
Peru to their lowest level for a quarter of a century.  The reasons
can be found in the overproduction of raw materials and processed
drugs, the increasing autonomy of national cartels and &quot;businesses&quot;
and the partial dismantling of the production, supply and transport
systems.
<P>
In Peru, the government of President Fujimori has decided to withdraw
the army from the war against drug trafficking giving, as one
of its reasons, the many corruption scandals that have been uncovered.
 The national police have once again been made responsible for
this activity.  However, no effective economic and social policy
has been implemented to deal with the crisis among coca plant
producers and help the country reach a structural solution to
the problem.
<H3>Alternatives</H3>

<P>
A quarter of a century after the beginning of the drug trafficking
era, particularly cocaine trafficking, policies to control and
reduce both demand and supply have proved ineffective.  Drug trafficking
today is pandemic.
<P>
All these policies and their underlying philosophical concepts
should now be reviewed, at international, national and regional
level.
<P>
In the case of Andean countries, United States' policy (&quot;Andean
drugs war&quot;) should be the first to be reviewed.  After more
than a decade of implementation of this policy, the problem of
coca leaf, opium poppy and marijuana production and their export
to the United States and Europe has not been resolved;  in fact,
quite the reverse, the problem has worsened.
<P>
One example is the expansion of land used for coca plant crops
in the Peruvian valley of Huallaga, which is the biggest coca
leaf production area in the world.  In 1970 at the beginning of
the drugs era, there were only 7,000 hectares of coca plants in
this valley, whereas today there are more than 200,000.  It is
important also not to forget the frequent human rights abuses
and corruption scandals that occur.
<P>
The concepts of shared responsibility and globality should also
be reviewed.  The debate should be approached from an economic
angle with a view to resolving the problem of rural poverty in
Andean countries and in all countries which grow illegal crops
as raw materials for natural drugs.  Mostly these are Third World
countries, except in the case of the United States, which is the
world's leading producer of marijuana.
<H3>Strategies</H3>

<P>
Given the wide range of interests at stake, most countries, particularly
those in the North which are the biggest consumers of drugs, refuse
to review or change their drugs policies.  National and regional
bodies are not sufficiently powerful to urge them to take the
necessary decisions.
<P>
The countries concerned could have an opportunity to negotiate
radical changes in their policies at the World Drugs Summit to
be held in 1997.  Consensus on the need for this Summit exists
among all the countries except the United States.
<P>
Structural adjustment policies, the unrestricted opening up of
our borders and protectionism among the rich nations of the North
have all contributed to the spread of poverty and consequently
to the expansion of illegal crops just as the recession has contributed
to expansion in the demand for drugs in industrialised countries.
 The only option is to redefine these policies and try to establish
a balanced relationship with developing countries.
<P>
As far as the Andean countries are concerned, a programme or strategy
for the whole region is needed urgently to enable them to negotiate
with the United States.  It is only in consensus that the Andean
countries will be able to resist the pressure for eradication
and militarisation from the United States.
<P>
Another step, particularly for Peru and Bolivia, would be to secure
the decriminalisation of the coca leaf and its withdrawal from
the list of narcotics drawn up by the 1961 Single Convention in
Vienna.
<P>
For the tropical regions of the Andes where the coca plant is
grown, it is essential to start a process of crop conversion.
 The damage caused to the environment by the production and processing
of coca plants is a threat to the greatest biodiversity of our
planet.

<H3>Illegal accumulation and world economy</H3>

<P>
In the recent past, the international drug market has further
spread and has become more complex. New consumption markets have
formed in the Third World and in the former socialist countries,
new criminal groups were born and the number of psychoactive substances
has grown. Drug trafficking is one of the most important fields
of transnational crime, because the activities of this traffic
(production, trade, laundering of illegal capital) have a world-wide
scale.
<P>
Even if the estimates are uncertain and contradictory, it is certain
that the illegal accumulation, derived not only from drugs but
from many activities (arms, nuclear materials, toxic waste, counterfeit
products, control of illegal immigration, &quot;organ commerce&quot;,
etc.) is comparable to that of big multinationals. According to
data from research institutes and the UN, the annual proceeds
of drug trafficking would be between 300 and 500 billion dollars
(but UNDCP indicates values between 500 and 1000 billion) and
the annual turnover of the large criminal organisations would
be 750 billion dollars.
<P>
The laundering of illegal money is promoted by the computerisation
of the financial channels and by the peculiarities of the international
economy. Last March, the DDA (Direzione Distrettuale Antimafia)
of Catania arrested a man above suspicion, making a banking transaction
of 1 billion dollars. The liberalisation of the circulation of
capitals, the creation of large regional markets (UE, NAFTA, APEC)
and the world-wide financial economy increase the possibility
of symbiosis of dirty and clean money. Every day in the world
financial market, there are transactions amounting to about 1.000
billion dollars, but the real exchanges are only a small part.
The majority is wandering capital going in search of more remunerative
income and an undeterminable share is formed by illegal capital.
<P>
In the opinion of the international organisations (e.g. the UN
World Conference on Organised Transnational Crime in Naples, 21-23
November 1994), the main cause of transnational crime is the anomalous
development of capitalism in new areas, notably different from
the &quot;classical&quot; countries (Western countries, USA, Japan).
In many countries, for instance in the former socialist countries,
there is a sort of &quot;jungle&quot;, i.e. a market without State
and without law. This analysis overlooks the fact that organised
crime started first in Western countries, both in peripheral-semiperipheral
areas, for instance Sicily and Southern Italy, and in central
areas, for instance USA. In this context, the new capitalist countries
follow the example of the Western countries.
<P>
My working hypothesis is that transnational crime is not pathological-anomalous
but a structural aspect of capitalist economy in its current phase,
definable as &quot;capitalism without alternatives&quot;. The
capitalistic globalisation and the international organisations'
policies (structural adjustments, dismantling of economic branches,
privatisation of public properties, unemployment, exchange liberalisation)
increase territorial disequilibria and social gaps and offer considerable
advantages to the illegal capital.
<P>
Therefore, we can say that, in marginal areas (the Souths of the
world, even the Souths in the Norths), illegal accumulation is
the &quot;criminal way to capitalism&quot; and in the central
areas (the Norths), it is the &quot;criminal way of capitalism&quot;.
<H3>Official policies</H3>

<P>
On 8 November 1990, the Council of Europe approved the Strasbourg
Convention on laundering, research, sequestration and confiscation
of criminal proceeds, signed by about 20 States. The European
Community studied the problem of organised crime through a board
of inquiry in 1991 and, in June of the same year, approved directive
n.328 on laundering the proceeds of illicit activities. Only a
few countries (Bulgaria, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom,
Switzerland, Italy, i.e. only three of the members of the EU)
ratified the Strasbourg Convention and, among the States that
have accepted the directive, some (France, Spain, Portugal) limited
the application to the proceeds of narcotraffic. Only Italy, Germany,
Belgium, Ireland, The Netherlands and the United Kingdom consider
as crime the laundering of the proceeds of all criminal activities.
The United Kingdom has excluded Jersey and Guernsey, the British
Isles best known as tax havens.
<P>
The international conference on prevention and control of laundering
dirty money and use of the proceeds of crime (Courmayeur 18-20
June 1994) showed the general lines of anti-crime world policy
resuming the Vienna Convention, the Basel Declaration and the
recommendations of FATF.
<P>
The Conference identified some priorities: introduction of the
crime &quot;laundering proceeds of drug traffic&quot; in the legal
system of the States subscribers of the Vienna Convention; restrictions
of banking secrecy; application of the rule of the Basel Declaration
&quot;Know your client&quot; and of FATF recommendations, especially
the abolition of the anonymous accounts and the identification
of the &quot;front men&quot;; the notification of suspicious transactions;
the control of the financial companies and professional offices
that offer financial services; the confiscation of proceeds of
illicit activities.
<P>
The UN Conference (Naples 21-23 November 1994) proposed the internationalisation
of the Italian crime &quot;associazione a delinquere di tipo mafioso&quot;.
However, the participants didn't come to an agreement on the abolition
of banking secrecy and on the laundry of dirty money. The opposers
were, above all, the small States that acted as tax havens, near
the United States and Europe.
<P>
It is impossible to treat problems so complex with precarious
committees and episodic recommendations, mostly doomed to remain
on paper, or with meetings whose utility is inversely proportional
to their cost. It is necessary to establish permanent organisations,
for instance a European monitoring centre on organised crime and
the laundering of dirty money; to bring into operation Europol,
until today paralysed by the divergences of the Member States;
to institute the formation of a European and international criminal
law.
<H3>Alternative Policies</H3>

<P>
An alternative policy must place the accent on prevention, acting
on the causes and on the forming process of illegal accumulation.
For this claim, it is necessary:
<P>
1) to change the economic policies of the frame the abolition
of prohibition, which acts as an incentive for criminal groups
to share out the drug business and criminalises the consumers.international
organisations. We must change from the present phase, which we
can name the &quot;dictatorship of profit and transnational corporations&quot;
to a new phase of &quot;economic democracy&quot;, based on local
development. Obviously, an economic democracy is impossible without
political democracy. All this is valid both for the UN and for
the EU. We must work to change from the superpower of some States
to the peoples' and citizens' community;
<P>
2) to develop the legal economy in the more marginalised countries,
starting from the local resources: raw materials, cultural goods,
human abilities;
<P>
3) to redefine and strengthen international cooperation, as collaboration
among equals and not as an imposition from the outside of foreign
and distorted patterns;
<P>
4) we must put inside this
<P>
Regarding the laundry of dirty money, it is necessary to stop
or at least to control the liberalisation of capital circulation,
reduce the circulation of speculative capital (tax forms, stock
exchange regulation, etc), abolish any form of obscurity of the
financial system: banking secrecy, tax havens, financial innovations,
etc.
<P>
It is evident that these policies are in counter-trend regarding
the present policies. If we do not want to cultivate a pious hope,
we must state a problem: with what forces, what means, what modalities
can we carry out such an ambitious alternative plan?
<P>
To set off on this way, we must strengthen the grass-roots organisations
(NGOs, citizens' associations) and help to create local, national
and international organisations based on real participation.
<H3>Proposals</H3>

<P>
1. To create a permanent network of NGOs and citizens' associations,
a grass-roots EU, open to other countries and continents, which
concentrate on the problems of alternative development, identifying
financial resources, collaborating in projects, forming the necessary
skills. This network must be at European, national and local levels.
We can name them: Alternative Development Laboratories.
<P>
2. To found alternative financial channels (for instance, the
Green Banks in Germany, the Italian Banca Etica and MAG: Mutua
Auto Gestione) for development projects in marginalised areas.
<P>
3. To bring into operation the network among the documentation
centres of European NGO Council on Drugs, and
<P>
4. to found, within this framework, a European monitoring centre
on the illegal accumulation and laundering dirty money. The tasks
of this centre could be the following:
<UL>
<LI>examining critically the laws in force and the international
conventions;
<LI>putting forward proposals to reform rules and conventions;
<LI>collecting documents: judicial and investigative acts, press
reviews (newspapers and magazines skilled on financial problems),
other sources;
<LI>publishing a bulletin;
<LI>organising information and education campaigns;
<LI>elaborating a project for the use of confiscated properties
to finance development projects and even the centre.

<H3>&quot;Drug capital in a neo-liberal world&quot;</H3>

<P>
Ten years after Ronald Reagan signed an executive order declaring
&quot;war on drugs&quot; the figures speak for themselves: far
from shrinking, the consumer market worldwide has expanded; it
has levelled off in the United States and Europe but new &quot;national
markets&quot; have been won in the cities of South America and
Africa. Drugs supply has been diversified with new synthetic drugs
coming onto the market, and a trend towards a more sophisticated,
in other words more destructive and deadly, consumption.
<P>
The area given over to poppy growing in Colombia has grown considerably
in only three years and cocaine production in Peru, Ecuador and
Bolivia has remained steady, despite the policy of destroying
crops and replacing coca plantations.
<P>
Major drug seizures have fallen in absolute terms while, simultaneously,
new drug trade routes have appeared and the number of outlets,
especially on the Atlantic side of South America, has increased.
<P>
The dismantling of the Medellin cartel and the supposed neutralisation
of the Cali cartel have not had any marked effect on Colombian
exports of drugs; quite the contrary, the huge increase in heroin
production confirms that producers are competing for European
markets, traditionally supplied from south-east Asia. Similarly,
there is an attempt to promote diversification of consumption
in the United States. In addition, other mafias, especially in
Bolivia, Brazil and Mexico, have enjoyed a meteoric rise.
<P>
Political and administrative corruption have led to new and even
juicier scandals, but this problem has kept on growing worldwide
and is now directly linked to illicit capital flows, especially
of drug capital.
<P>
The combination of these factors has stimulated, as in any self-respecting
free market, a trend towards higher prices, defying the very laws
of that free market since supplies have grown and there are rarely
any temporary shortages.
<P>
The general evolution of the drugs market reveals the ineffectiveness
of the current policies intended to &quot;eliminate the problem&quot;.
One possible explanation for this failure is that, whereas repressive
measures are concentrated in the areas of production or distribution
(increasingly involving massive participation by the military),
the financial aspect, ie the mobilisation of capital, its legalisation
and the use of profits, is somewhat lax. This discrepancy is baffling
to say the least, since it is now widely accepted that capital
is the driving force of the drugs trade and that its high rate
of return explains its vitality.
<P>
Drugs always have been, and still are, an excellent trade product,
booming despite the apocalyptic tone of official rhetoric, calling
into question the effectiveness of repressive strategies. Together
with smuggling and the arms trade, with which it has many connections,
it is one of the most profitable forms of trade. Drugs trafficking
is a decisive factor in maintaining certain driving forces of
some regional economies, cycles which tend to consolidate so-called
&quot;marginal economies&quot;. Capital from the drugs trade supports
a social structure where the state is conspicuous by its absence,
as is the case in the forests of eastern Peru, in the Chapare
(Bolivia), in some Amazonian regions of Brazil and central-eastern
Colombia. In these rural regions (as well as some inner-city neighbourhoods),
drug money is the cornerstone of consumption, funding production
and trading activities.
<P>
Laundering drug capital is the main medium of this trade, the
keystone to the whole structure, a factor even more vital than
the availability of production resources or other prerequisites
for the production process.
<P>
Both these factors - the industrial factor of production resources
and the financial factor of profit and investment - are directly
related to the will (or lack of will) demonstrated in world centres,
wherever they are, to give priority to tackling drugs trafficking
and drugs consumption.
<P>
The steady growth of large-scale drug-capital laundering and the
remarkable inability of developed countries to prevent, repress
and eliminate the laundering of drug money, points to contradictions
in attitudes whereby determination fails, impetus is undermined
and good intentions undone whenever attempts are made to intervene
in that murky and deliberately complex universe called the world
financial system. If it were possible to describe those paralysing
contradictions, even only sketchily, it might be possible to offer
an explanation for the failures of policies designed to combat
the problem of drugs trafficking and consumption.
<P>
As long as there is no orchestration of effective action plans
to put a stranglehold on financial movements of drug capital,
it will be difficult to stamp out the other manifestations of
the phenomenon. This, at least, is what can be deduced from ten
years of declared war on drugs trafficking.
<P>
This aspect of the problem which offers a decisive role to financial
operations must first be dealt with thoroughly, even if it seems
obvious: those responsible for financial transactions linked to
drug trafficking are not the same people who oversee production
and organise the traffic. The former work in the business world
and enjoy the prestige resulting from their legal activities,
an increasingly elastic and &quot;pragmatic&quot; legality.
<P>
Laundering capital takes advantage of a certain impunity given
that the borderline between legality and illegality is vague in
the world of finance, a world which worships a new religion whose
first commandment is success. Arms manufacturers never give a
thought to the consequences of their use and rarely bother to
find out how certain arms end up in the hands of people who should
never have received them. The same goes for chemical agents and,
in particular, money: the universally accepted norm is an attempt
to turn secrecy into a sacred value as far as the identity of
the investor, capitalist or holder of a bank account is concerned.
Since no norm is a norm unless it is widespread or universalised,
the risk of illegal manipulation is accepted and considered an
exceptional consequence.
<P>
But in practice, it is by no means an exceptional consequence:
experts think that larger and larger proportions of worldwide
financial activity are accounted for by the movement of proceeds
from illegal activities. Certain codes distinguish between &quot;grey
capital&quot; and &quot;black capital&quot;, in order to differentiate
between money produced by tax evasion, fraud linked to over-invoicing
or under-invoicing of merchandise, on the one hand, and kickbacks
in government spheres, the capital raised from smuggling merchandise
and arms, drug trafficking and the white slave trade.
<P>
The very existence of this distinction encourages the gradual
abandonment of scruples: certain money laundering operations are
not seen as criminal and are not condemned by society; they are
seen as a tolerable means of increasing profits, i.e. a way of
achieving more success.
<P>
The explicit discrimination practised by American anti-drug agencies
is not unrelated to this situation: they focus their effort and
pressure on governments to tighten up their legislation against
drug dollars but rule out any initiative aimed at stamping out
any other kind of money laundering. The bilateral agreements signed
over the last two years between the United States and Latin American
governments, in order to bring about practical judicial co-operation,
clearly limit initiatives to crimes related to drug money laundering.
<P>
Incidentally, this attitude - accepted by most Latin American
governments - has led to embarrassing situations. For example,
in the recently-created Mercosur organisation (the Common Market
of the South), the process of economic integration suffers from
periodic problems because Uruguayan legislation on the free circulation
of capital facilitates tax evasion in Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay.
The consequences are not only regional: the advantages of the
Uruguayan tax haven made possible the biggest-ever tax evasion
operation in Belgium's history.
<P>
A number of recent episodes in Latin America point to flaws in
the South American approach: tax evasion, trade racketeering and
drug dollars often form capital laundering circuits and deliberately
use multiple transfers, bank deposits and financial investment
to cover up the origin of the money and so make it &quot;clean&quot;.
<P>
Certain triangular financial operations between Argentina, Uruguay
and Bosnia have made possible arms sales and, at the same time,
the laundering of capital identified as coming from drugs traffic.
Money laundering has become a cornerstone of financial movements
in Latin America whereas official statistics reveal a steady fall
in investment and production.
<P>
Speculation flows of &quot;hot money&quot; have led to competition
for attracting it, so that there is now a trend towards the progressive
liberalisation of capital movements, the gradual removal of all
control mechanisms and the strengthening of secrecy, be it banking,
administrative or registration secrecy. Since this &quot;hot money&quot;
disappears as quickly as it appears, Latin American financial
markets maximalise this play of facilities. Since money laundering
goes hand in hand with certain kinds of political and administrative
corruption there has been an increase in the mechanisms for protecting
information to counter demands for greater transparency.
<P>
The need to preserve institutional stability has led to a trend
towards greater secrecy. Banking secrecy is now seen as necessary
for the stability of the financial system, but it can also be
used to ward off crises in the political system rocked by corruption
scandals. The message being sent by governments is clear: the
facilities given to capital transfers are in step with the economic
trend towards total deregulation.
<P>
Although this strategy has not borne the fruit expected of it
and macro-economic indicators are disappointing, the policies
pursued have amplified this trend so that in Latin America, at
least, speculative activity has dominated the financial sector.
<P>
Inevitably, capital laundering has increased to a point where
capital of illicit origin is used to finance certain essential
aspects of current economic policies. In certain countries it
has been claimed that capital raised from the drug trade has been
used to support the privatisation of public undertakings; in other
cases, the steady flow of this capital has made it possible to
implement monetary policies designed to reduce inflation; in yet
other cases, it has been used to end the in-fighting between different
sectors of authority or used to fund fraudulent operations for
implementing politico-military strategies at regional level.
<P>
In this way, the proceeds from drug trafficking have been used
to finance economic policies designed to promote the full liberalisation
of markets as well as a deregulation of the commercial and financial
sectors. Behind these strategies we can detect the hand of multilateral
lending bodies or the guidance of American specialist agencies,
which in turn highlights a new paradox: while certain American
agencies are putting pressure on governments to limit banking
secrecy vis-&agrave;-vis drug trafficking offences, others oppose
any change designed to slow down any opening of the market or
liberalisation.
<P>
This has been the case, for example, of certain international
loans which have been subjected to a restructuring of central
banks towards deregulation of the financial system.
<P>
In Latin America, at least, those involved in drug trafficking
are fervent defenders of so-called neo-liberal policies because
they undoubtedly are in their interests. Of course, it is not
our intention to establish a cause-and-effect relationship between
neo-liberalism and drug trafficking, but it cannot be ignored
that these neo-liberal policies have resulted in record levels
of corruption.
<P>
The strategy to weaken the state and encourage the privatisation
of public companies has fostered kickbacks: witness the organised
systems of pay-offs for authorising certain transactions between
state bodies and private companies. This corruption boom has boosted
the influence wielded by the drug cartels' money-men.
<P>
Inevitably, drug trafficking capital seems to be linked to the
major financial scandals and, as is the case in Colombia or Mexico,
they even seem to be involved in manipulation for the purpose
of forming governments or influencing the outcome of electoral
campaigns.
<P>
Consequently, it could be said that drug capital takes the front
seat in economic processes, leading to yet another paradox inherent
in the worldwide drug problem: maintaining neo-liberal strategies,
supporting the principle of deregulation and extreme liberalisation
tends to strengthen the role of drugs traffic two-fold. It props
up the marginal aspects of official markets as well as providing
a source of financial resources in long periods of recession.
Some analysts believe that drug dollars are also used, occasionally
to honour external debt repayments.
<P>
Certain Latin America specialists and analysts claim that the
role played by illegal capital in national and regional economic
processes has reached a point where to do without it would probably
trigger total collapse. Others try to play down this role, qualifying
it as influential but not decisive. Whatever the conclusion, there
does not appear to be a genuine desire in official circles to
stamp out the problem, whether in international decision-making
centres or national governments.
<P>
To do something effective, a determined action plan is needed
in order to lift certain legal smokescreens designed to increase
all kinds of secrecy, the basis of financial activities linked
to drugs trafficking.
<P>
The abolition of banking secrecy and the installation of controls
on capital movements would be the main planks of any strategy
designed to stifle the drug traffickers' financial activities.
But this would entail co-ordination at various levels between
governments and major private financial institutions, on the basis
of solid and sincere agreements.
<P>
Otherwise these habits will continue in Latin America, especially
in tax havens: governments will introduce control rules but they
will not be applied. Following their example, private institutions
will tend to relax their own preventive controls instead of tightening
them. Is it possible to implement such sincere and solid agreements?
In theory, yes, although for that purpose it will be necessary
to eliminate political obstacles associated with current economic
models. The challenge is all the greater because these obstacles
are highly structured, and based on economic and political correlation
and dependence.
<P>
Any other solution, such as the definition of new economic crimes,
together with sanctions (many countries do not consider money
laundering a crime) may prove partial and inadequate and, even
worse, may be scorned by the drug traffickers. They have already
demonstrated &quot;genius&quot;, audacity and shamelessness in
dodging armies, deriding controls, violating borders and corrupting

<P>
In a few days time, the international community will be gathering
in Rio de Janeiro to take crucial decisions on two important area
relating to the wellbeing of our planet Earth and to our societies.
The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED),
to be held in Brazil from the 3rd to 15th June 1992, will be the
climax of a process which began in December 1989 by the adoptive
of resolution 44/228 by the Session of the United Nations General
Assembly. The main objective of the conference is to take steps
to reverse trends and establish the basis for a sustainable way
of life on the planet as we move into the 21st century.
<P>
It will be an exercise in international diplomacy to review the
overall situation of the environment and its interrelationship
with development already recognized twenty years ago at the United
Nations Conference on the Human Environment, heId in Stockholm,
Sweden, in 1972. Fifteen years later in 1987, in its report &quot;Our
Common Future&quot;, the World Commission in Environment and Development
concluded that &quot;environment&quot; and &quot;development&quot;
must be integrated to achieve &quot;sustainable development&quot;
which &quot;meets the needs of the present without compromising
the ability of future generations to meet their own needs&quot;.
<P>
UNCED, or the Earth Summit as it is now called, will hopefuIIy
bring to a conclusion a threeyear exercise on a number of issues,
mapping out a strategy with builtin mechanisms to address the
degradation of and threats to the environment and create a more
balanced and equitable sustainable development.
<P>
Among the issues which the Earth Summit will address are:
<P>
protection of the atmosphere (climate change, depletion of the
ozone layer, transboundary air pollution);
<P>
protection of land resources (combating deforestation, soil loss,
desertification and drought);
<P>
protection of freshwater resources;
<P>
protection of oceans, seas and coastal areas, and the rational
use and development of their living resources;
<P>
environmentally sound management of biotechnology and hazardous
wastes (including toxic chemicals);
<P>
prevention of illegal traffic in toxic products and wastes;
<P>
improvement in the quality of life and human health; and
<P>
improvement in living and working conditions of the poor by eradicating
poverty and stopping environmental degradation.
<P>
The Rio Conference will also consider the underling patterns which
cause stress to the environment, addressing issues like poverty
in developing countries, levels of economic growth, unsustainable
patterns of consumption, demographic pressures and the impact
of the international economy.
<P>
The Conference is expected to adopt:
<P>
the Rio Declaration that will embody basic principles that must
govern the economic and environmental behaviour of peoples and
nations to ensure &quot;our common future&quot;;
<P>
Agenda 21, a blueprint for action in all major areas affecting
the relationship between the environment and the economy, focusing
on the period up to the year 2000 and extending into the 21st
century;
<P>
the means to carry out the Agenda by making available to developing
countries the additional financial resources and environmentally
sound technologies they require to participate fully in global
environmental cooperation and to integrate environmental considerations
into development policies and practices;
<P>
agreement on strengthening institutions in order to implement
these measures; and
<P>
a Framework Convention on Climate Change. a Convention on Biological
Diversity and a Convention on Forestry
<P>
But you may ask, why have I introduced my intervention by giving
prominence to the forthcoming Rio Conference. The answer is simple.
For Malta, the agenda of the Conference presents a challenge,
a vision for the future, a compliment to the initiatives taken
by Malta at the United Nations in the protection and conservation
of the environment, that which represents today the fundamental
concept of the &quot;common good&quot;, which in the words of
the Maltese Prime Minister &quot;was traditionally considered
the object of political activity for the individual State, (and)
should now be seen to be and become the good of all human kind.&quot;
<P>
It was precisely on this concept that already twentyfive wears
ago, Malta introduced the concept of the Common Heritage of Mankind
to the international seabed and ocean floor and the subsoil thereof,
underlying the high seas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction,
and that this area would be used exclusively for peaceful purposes
and its resources would be used for the common benefit of all
mankind. The adoption of the U.N. Convention on
<P>
the Law of the See in 1982, heralded the first allencompassing
international legal regime that brought together, in an unprecedented
achievement, ideals for the conservation of the environment with
those of &quot;equitable and economic development.&quot;
<P>
In 1988, another concept was launched by Malta and accepted by
the community of nations in the UN General Assembly resolution
43/53. I am referring to the Common Concern of Mankind attributed
to Climate Change. This in turn started a process that will reach
its climax at the Rio Conference by the adoption of a Framework
Convention on Climate Change that will serve to protect global
climate for present and future generations of humankind.
<P>
A year later, Malta submitted for the consideration of the 44th
Session of the United Nations General Assembly yet another environmental
issue on the &quot;Protection of ExtraTerritorial Spaces for Present
and Future Generations&quot;. Malta's request to establish a Group
of Eminent Persons to prepare a study on this problem did not
attract sufficient attention and it was decided to adjourn the
debate on this issue. However, I am glad to point out that the
International Law Commission has taken up the matter in its consideration
of the topic &quot;International liability for injurious consequences
arising out of acts not prohibited by international law&quot;.
<P>
Professor Guido de Marco, in his capacity as the President of
the 45th Session of the General Assembly, put forward a proposal
whereby the United Nations Trusteeship Council would be given
an additional function under the United Nations Charter to hold
in trust for humanity its common heritage and its common concerns:
the environment, the protection of the extraterritorial zones,
the resources of the sea and of the seabed, the climate and the
rights of future generations.
<P>
The proposal to give additional functions to the UN Trusteeship
Council would create a complementing mechanism that would strengthen
and manage those parts of the planet that fall outside notional
jurisdiction &quot;through international cooperation and agreed
regimes for surveiIIance, development and management in the common
interest.&quot;
<P>
The ongoing discussions on environment and development should
make us pause and take a closer look at the two initiatives launched
by Malta on the protection of extraterritorial zones and the UN
Trusteeship Council which in my view merit further consideration,
perhaps even suggesting what action con be taken to promote them
further.
<H4><B>Extraterritorial spaces </B></H4>

<P>
On 24 July 1989, following a Cabinet decision to accept a proposal
put foreword by Professor David Attard, Malta, through its Permanent
Representative to the United Nations, on 11th August 1989, addressed
a letter to the SecretaryGeneral of the United Nations requesting
the inclusion in the provisional agenda of the 44th Session of
the General Assembly under item 83, entitled &quot;Development
and international economic cooperation&quot;, of a supplementary
subitem entitled &quot;Environmental protection of extraterritorial
spaces for present and future generations&quot; in the agenda
of the 44th session of the General Assembly.
<P>
In an explanatory memorandum annexed to the proposal, Doc. A/44/193
dated 17th August 1989, Malta spelled out the rationale for the
effective and comprehensive environmental protection of extraterritorial
spaces, such as the high seas, which Malta viewed as vital to
safeguard the global environment. The memorandum went on to explain
that &quot;the human urge to improve, coupled with increased population
growth, and the remarkable developments in technology may cause
substantial, irreparable environmental harm to an increasing number
of 'extraterritorial spaces'. This harm, to a greater or lesser
extent, would adversely affect all States and would prejudice
the interests which the international community as a whole may
have in the said spaces.&quot;
<P>
In view of the magnitude and complexity of the issue, the Government
of Malta, proposed that the 44th Session of the General Assembly
&quot;should request the SecretaryGeneral to establish, through
the Executive Director of UNEP, a group of eminent persons to
prepare or study, which would,
<P>
interalia, make recommendations with respect to the identification
and extent of 'extraterritorial spaces,' the state of the environment
in such spaces, the rights and duties of States and the international
community therein, and possible strengthening of relevant existing
legal instruments, and which would make proposals on how the effective
and comprehensive environmental protection of such space can be
best achieved&quot;.
<P>
On 14th September 1989, the Prime Minister of Malta wrote a letter
to a number of eminent persons requesting their personal support
in order to ensure the smooth passage of this proposal. On his
letter, the Prime Minister highlighted the fact that &quot;it
is pointless to protect the environment in areas that fall within
notional jurisdiction, but, at the same time, neglect the environmental
integrity of the ExtraTerritorial Spaces. The current state of
the High Seas, for example, demonstrates that this ExtraTerritorial
Space con no longer continue to safely accommodate all human needs
and uses. There is also the question of interdependence between
the various ExtraTerritorial Spaces.
<P>
Letters were sent. among others to, President Mugabe of Zimbabwe.
Prime Minister Lubbers of the Netherlands, Prime Minister Brundtland
of Norway, Prime Minister Rocard of France, Prime Minister Gandhi
of India. President Mubarak of Egypt and Prime Minister Mulroney
of Canada.
<P>
The Executive Director of UNEP, Dr. Mostafa Tolba, characterized
the proposal as &quot;'timely and necessary&quot; and encouraged
the Government of Malta to put forward its proposal.
<P>
The former United Nations SecretaryGeneral, Javier Perez de Cuellar,
in a letter to the Prime Minister of Malta, stated that the proposal
clearly indicated that &quot;this is an area which deserves serious
attention.&quot; He also paid tribute to the Government of Malta
for the forwardlooking approaches which it continued to take with
regard to environmental issues that are of such major concern
to the international community as a whole.
<P>
On 20th September 1989, the General Committee of the General Assembly
approved the inclusion of the item 43 part of the Agenda of the
Assembly, allocating the discussion and consideration of the issue
to its Second (Economic) Committee.
<P>
Immediately afterwards, intensive informal consultations began
on a draft text of a resolution based primarily on the points
contained in the Explanatory Memorandum presented previously.
<P>
The initial reactions to the draft were not encouraging, and as
had happened on many other instances at the United Nations, questions
were raised as to how much the proposal was valid or whether such
an initiative cost money or whether it infringed on the sovereignty
of a State. It was therefore of no surprise that Malta's proposal
did not receive that enthusiastic support which it merited even
though many others recognized that the problem did exist. After
all one still remembers the air of initial scepticism and uncertainties
that surrounded the initiatives introduced by Malta on the Law
of the Sea and on Climate Change.
<P>
During the informal consultations concerns were expressed on the
definition of the phrase 'extraterritorial spaces' as according
to certain delegations this was a completely new terminology and
because it was used in reference to a concept that was not fully
understood. Others questioned the appropriateness for the setting
up of an Eminent Persons Group, the difficulty in defining its
terms of reference and the fact that such a Group would have entered
into uncharted or sensitive and controversial waters (such as
Antarctica). The point was also made that already too many activities
and initiatives relating to the environment were being undertaken
and therefore some questioned whether the time was opportune to
open up in a new direction.
<P>
The Maltese Delegation, taking into account most of the points
raised, formally submitted to the Secretariat on 15 November 1989,
a revised draft resolution which was circulated under the reference
A/C.2/44/L.41. The Maldives, Mali, Vanuatu, Paraguay and Togo,
joined as cosponsors of the draft resolution.
<P>
The draft resolution was formally introduced in the Second Committee
of the General Assembly on 20 November 1989, after which it was
examined in informal consultations in one of the Working Groups
of the Committee chaired by one of its ViceChairmen.
<P>
Very extensive and elaborous consultations were held which could
not be concluded because of the limited time available and when
it seemed thus some form of a consensus could be reached, the
process was suspended.
<P>
The reactions following the decision not to press for action highlighted
the complexity of this topic. The consultations held helped delegations
to be enlightened in their thinking on this topic which deserved
all that attention. France, on behalf of the European Community,
stated that although the time was not ripe, the initiative was
useful and could be raised later.
<P>
In its decision 44/51, the General Assembly on the recommendation
of the Second Committee, decided to take no action on the draft
resolution &quot;at the present time&quot; thus leaving the door
open for further consideration of the Maltese initiative.
<P>
In retrospect, one can realize the difficulties faced by a number
of delegations to come to grips with the portent of the Maltese
proposal. Precisely because of the concerns raised and the questions
made that the proposal could have been addressed if the draft
text of the resolution had been successfully negotiated and adopted
giving the mandate to an eminent person group to study the matter.
<P>
The failure of the General Assembly to adapt a text on this important
subject, was fortunately enough mitigated by an important development
in the International Low Commission and in the Preparatory Committee
for UNCED.
<P>
The International Law Commission, for some time now, has been
exploring the possibility of extending the topic of liability
for acts not prohibited by international law to harm caused to
the socalled &quot;global commons&quot;. The
<P>
Special Rapporteur, Prof. Julio Barboza, in his sixth report contained
in document A/CN.4/428/Add.1, deals extensively and in detail
on the liability for harm to the environment in areas beyond national
jurisdiction that which Malta has described in its proposal to
the United Nations cis &quot;extraterritorial spaces&quot;.
<P>
Prof. Barboza's report unequivocally ascertains that &quot;we
have now reached the point where cumulative effects, on the one
hand, and major accidents, on the other, are causing harm to the
environment which is having and appreciable (significant) impact
on States, their nationals and their property&quot;. The report
continues that &quot;'the effects usually are not concentrated
in one place: they are dispersed by water or aircurrent and disappear
into the vastness of the seas or the atmosphere. The harm is intangible
for now potentially threatening, and no longer just for the environment
but also for mankind itself.
<P>
It is of great satisfaction to note that the International Law
Commission's recommendation that this question be put on its agenda
has been endorsed by the 46th Session of the General Assembly.
<P>
Yet another development which has to be recorded here, is the
text that is being considered for discussion at UNCED relating
to the sustainable use and conservation of the high seas living
resources. This proposal, if adopted, would promote rules for
management and conservation of the marine living resources on
the high seas so as not to cause damage to the living resources
within the 200mile limit of national jurisdiction of coastal States.
<H4><B>The U.N. Trusteeship Council</B></H4>

<P>
The evolvement of the environmental protection of our planet and
the fact that &quot;the atmosphere and the oceans are not the
property of any particular State or group of States, but are a
common property of all nations on the globe&quot;, should create
a new conscience to control the contamination of these environmental
resources that effect the present and future generations of mankind.
<P>
It is a well known fact that the creation of new mechanisms or
institutions within the United Nations system has always raised
eyebrows and objections particularly when it relates to their
organizational and financial structures. These in fact are the
two major stumbling blocks which have caused divisiveness among
and between participants of the preparatory process for UNCED
where agreement has still to be reached particularly on how to
finance Agenda 21 and what institutional arrangement should be
established to monitor the implementation of Agenda 21.
<P>
One therefore appreciates the timely and valid proposal put forward
by Prof. de Marco during the Fortyfifth Session of the United
Nations General Assembly and later expounded in a number of lectures
he delivered in Genoa, Moscow, Beijing, Turin and Prague, on giving
an additional role to the UN Trusteeship Council, transforming
it into a guardian and supervisor of matters &quot;affecting the
Common Heritage and Common Concerns of an everlasting humanity.&quot;
<P>
During his Presidency, Prof. de Marco emphasized the need to revitalize
the United Nations General Assembly and through it the United
Nations. In mapping out a twelve point proposal on the future
role of a Second Generation United Nations, he spoke on the Trusteeship
Council, one of the the five major organs of the United Nations
System, as follows:
<P>
&quot;I feel that with a slight correction this body can be made
to function for the common wealth of man. I suggest that from
an administrator of territories, this Trusteeship Council be converted
into a guardian and supervisor of the common heritage of mankind.
The resources of the sea and of the seabad, the climate, the environment
particularly the protection of the extraterritorial zones and
the rights of future generations, all these priceless possessions
of humanity, invoke the creation of such a Council if they are
to be handed down to future generations&quot;.
<P>
It is a known fact that the role of the Trusteeship Council has
been reduced as a result of the attainment of independence by
those NonSelfGoverning Territories administered by a number of
Member States. It will also be
<P>
recalled that the Trusteeship Council was established under Chapter
XIII of the United Nations Charter to supervise the administration
of Trust Territories and to ensure that Governments responsible
for their administration took adequate steps to prepare them for
the achievement of the Charter goals. In the early years of the
United Nations, 11 Territories were placed under the Trusteeship
System. By 1975, all except the Trust Territory of the Pacific
Islands had either attained independence or were united with neighbouring
State to form an independent country.
<P>
Furthermore, the Trusteeship Agreements of three entities of the
Pacific Islands the Federated States if Micronesia, the Marshall
Islands and the Northern Mariana Islands were terminated by Security
Council resolution 683 on 22 December 1990. While the Northern
Marianas opted for Commonwealth status in 1975, the Federated
States of Micronesia and the Marshall Islands became full Members
of the United Nations Organization. Palau the lost remaining entity
of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands has yet to determine
its future status. Until then, the United States remains the Administering
Authority of Palau reporting periodicaIIy to the Trusteeship Council.
<P>
Now that the major goals of the Council have been achieved, consideration
could be given to the adaptation of the International Trusteeship
System under Article 75 to 91 of the UN Charter to guard and supervise
'the global commons' for the benefit of all nations. The Council
could align its present procedure of considering and examining
reports on matters affecting the Common Heritage and Common Concerns
thus ensuring cooperation on those critical and uncontrolled areas
described as the global commons.
<P>
In a 1977 report prepared for UNEP/IOC, Dr. Michael Waldichuk,
a leading Canadian marine scientist, stated that:
<P>
<I>Because the atmosphere and the oceans are not the property
of any particular State or group of States, but are a common property
of all the notions on the globe, there must be some control of
contamination of these environmental resources.</I>
<P>
While it must be recognized that since Dr.Waldichuk's report national
legislation as well as international multilateral conventions
and protocols have been adopted and mechanisms established for
safeguarding what man has, since his creation, considered as his
common property, there remains a need for a central authority
or organ that can truly assess the state of these global commons,
give guidance and examine how the norms of international cooperation
in the protection and preservation of the &quot;possessions of
humanity&quot; can be advanced and promoted further.
<P>
The relevance of such an &quot;authority&quot; is further accentuated
by the fact that no agreement was reached during the preparatory
phase of UNCED on the institutional arrangements concerning the
body that will be in charge of the detailed implementation of
Agenda 21.
<P>
In the light of this impasse, Malta intends to pursue its proposal
made at the last Fourth Preparatory Committee on giving an additional
assignment to the United Nations Trusteeship Council, by promoting
this initiative at the forthcoming session of UHCED in Rio next
month. This would give a broader institutional framework which
would ensure in the longer term the political momentum envisaged
to be generated in Rio.
<H4><B>A Proposal</B></H4>

<P>
As a complementary measure to the steps envisaged to be taken
at UNCED, it is my view that further enhancement of this initiative
could be achieved if a parallel process of momentum building is
undertaken at the earliest. In this regard, I wish to propose
a three stage plan that would sensitize and amplify the proposal
on the Trusteeship Council.
<P>
The first stage would be for this Mediterranean Academy of Diplomatic
Studies to prepare an indepth study on how the United Nations
Trusteeship Council could involve itself as a guardian for specific
environmental concerns. In the preparation of this study, the
assistance should be sought of UN bodies and programmes such as
UNEP, WMO, IMO, IOC and ILC
<P>
which could provide inputs at the experts and technical level.Once
this study is completed, an international expert meeting could
be organized where this report could be presented to a wider audience,
preferably composed of Government representatives. NonGovernmental
Organizations could also be involved in this review.
<P>
The third stage would be to submit the findings of the study plus
the views of Government representatives and NGO's, to a meeting
to be convened under the auspices of the United Nations and its
relevant Specialized Agencies that would prepare a final report
to the United Nations General Assembly for a decision.
<P>
This process should be seen as a translation into practical terms
of the discussions being held to revitalize and restructure the
work of the General Assembly, to reform and improve the efficiency
and effectiveness of the United Nations, particularly of its principal
organs.
<H4><B>Conclusion</B></H4>

<P>
The former Commonwealth SecretaryGeneral, Sir Shridath Ramphal,
in his address made at St. John's College in 1989, during the
inauguration of the Cambridge Lectures on Environment and Development:
Our Common Future, stated:
<P>
<I>Some international problems those concerned with the global
commons, the oceans and the ocean bed, the atmosphere, Antarctica,
which no one owns present particular problems. Unless access is
regulated in some way, rising demand will result in overuse. For
the global commons this means internationally agreed controls.
</I>
<P>
He further underlined the Brundtland Commission's message of a
&quot;common future&quot; in that the &quot;unspoken premise that
we must think of our planet not only as a world of many States
but also as the state of our one world; thus we
<P>
must be ready to nurture tomorrow's concepts of global governance,
not have them stifled at birth by yesterday's notions of national
sovereignty; that our common future may not be secured save by
the reach of enforceable law across environmentally invisible
frontiers.&quot;
<P>
The strengthened awareness and utility of the United Nations in
solving international political issues has increased the commitment
of all Member States to abide more scrupulously with the provisions
of the Charter of the Organization. While serious problems will
always exist, there is recognition that with determination and
will, collectively we can find durable solutions to these problems.
The problems faced by humanity in the protection and preservation
of our environment are many. A revitalized and restructured United
Nations can contribute towards this end. Some of its bodies may
no longer reflect the needs of present day commitments and could
be improved, if not reformed.
<P>
This is the case of the Trusteeship Council. Its effectiveness
has diminished if not disappeared. It can still play a role as
a Keeper of the Global Commons for Future Generations. Are we
ready to assist in bringing this idea to fruition?<A NAME="mark2">

<H3><B>THE EVOLUTION OF AN INTERNATIONAL REGIME OF ENVIRONMENTAL
PROTECTION IN THE AREAS BEYOND NATIONAL JURISDICTION</B></H3>

<P>
Statehood implies absolute sovereignty over a particular territory.
Matters within the competence of states under international law
are said to belong to the &quot;reserved domain&quot; and therefore
falling under the national jurisdiction of States. During these
last three decades a number of issues were internationalised and
politicised to become part of the international agenda. In this
context the environment has become a matter of international concern
rather than pertaining solely to the domestic jurisdiction of
States. The reasons for this are mainly twofold: first the degradation
of the environment knows no national boundaries and secondly the
effects of such degradation are not only transgressing boundaries
but also evident in areas lying beyond the limits of national
jurisdiction. The international legal framework relating to the
environment has evolved rapidly since the 1972 Stockholm Conference
on the Human Environment. However conflicts of interests between
States have often been the cause of sporadic efforts and ineffectual
results.
<P>
International Environmental Law attempts to achieve an equilibrium
between the protection of the environment and the sovereign right
of States to development. This entails the creation of a system
of rights and obligations in order to strike a proper balance
of interests and, where this equilibrium is disturbed, in order
to provide an adequate remedy. Efforts to protect the environment
mainly deal with activities which have a negative effect on areas
within State jurisdiction. This is understandable due to the fact
that a large number of environmentally harmful activities are
carried out within the territories of sovereign States, effective
enforcement
<P>
jurisdiction has traditionally belonged to States and the absence
of an effective international institutional authority, have further
encouraged this tendency. This approach, however, has proved to
be highly inadequate, because environmental harm is not only transnational
in scope but has also negative effects on areas beyond the limits
of national jurisdiction.
<P>
In this context, the international community has not yet succeeded
in developing an effective international regime which recognizes
the importance of regulating anthropogenic activities that have
an adverse effect on areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction,
whether these activities occur <U>within</U> or <U>outsidenational
borders</U>. Various treaties regulating these areas such as the
Outer Space Treaties and the Antarctica Treaties do exist; the
approach however is rather haphazard and piecemeal, despite the
interdependence which exists between these extraterritorial spaces.
<P>
Having participated in the various negotiating sessions for a
framework convention on climate change I have chosen to concentrate
particularly on this part of the environment which falls beyond
the limits of national jurisdiction but it can be said that the
legal regime established to protect climate from change can be
viewed as an example which may be adopted to safeguard other areas
lying outside territorial jurisdiction. It is therefore pertinent
to examine emerging issues during the sessions of negotiations,
to analyse whether the regime has met with expectations and where
it has failed, and what are the international regimes and mechanisms
needed for the future.
<H4><B>Sovereignty</B></H4>

<P>
Sovereignty has been the main stumbling block in achieving appropriate
commitments. Sovereignty has been defined as the State's absolute
and exclusive authority and control over its territory. The main
rule of this sovereign equality of States is the duty of each
State within the international community to refrain from intervention
in the external and internal affairs of
<P>
other States. Sovereignty is therefore an obstacle to provide
a solution to problems which are transnational in scope.
<P>
To qualify as an issue pertaining to the domestic jurisdiction
the matter has to be beyond the cognizance of International Law.
It is debatable whether a matter which falls essentially within
the domestic jurisdiction of States can be removed from the reserved
domain by becoming subject to a treaty obligation. In real fact
with respect to certain issues considered to be of international
concern by the United Nations General Assembly, the international
community has witnessed the erosion of the notion of the reserved
domain, i.e the domain of State activities where the jurisdiction
of the State is not limited by International Law. The notion of
reserved domain is relative because a State cannot plead provisions
of its Law or its deficiencies as a defence, whilst international
obligations may refer to national law as a means of describing
a status to be created and protected.
<P>
The traditional concept of sovereignty is often interpreted in
such a way as to be the root cause of marginality and residuality
of International Law as if a State owes duty to its citizens and
neighbouring States but not to the International Society as a
whole.
<P>
Sovereignty is used as a term to describe the legal personality
of a State and incidences of that personality in International
Law. In the <U>Island of Palmas Case</U>, it was held that concomitant
to the right of territorial sovereignty, a State has the duty
to protect within its territory the rights of other States. The
<U>Trail Smelter Arbitration</U><B> </B>case lays down that a
State has an obligation not to use its rights to the extent of
injuring the rights of others and the <U>Corfu Channel Case </U>confirms
this by acknowledging that the principle of sovereignty embodies
the obligation of every State not to allow its territory to be
used for acts contrary to the rights of others.
<P>
A proper balance between external competence and international
responsibility has not yet been attained. Sovereignty continues
to be abused of and used as a guise by States to avoid commitments
of an international nature. It has to be finetuned by States and
restructured to
<P>
meet with the needs of the formulation of a global strategy to
protect the International Commons.
<P>
In the preamble to the Climate Convention the parties agreed that:
<P>
States have in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations
and the principles of International law the sovereign right to
exploit their own resources, pursuant to their own environmental
policies and the responsibility to ensure that activities within
their jurisdiction or control do not cause damage to the environment
of other States or of areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction.
<P>
This first paragraph recalls Principle 21 and 22 of the Stockholm
Declaration. These two principles were the first attempt in International
Law to regulate environmental protection on a global scale. It
took these two principles, formerly considered as &quot;soft law&quot;,
twenty years to be embodied in a multilateral convention even
if they are only preambular rather than substantive in nature:
<P>
The parties reaffirm the principle of sovereignty of States
<P>
in international cooperation to address climate change.
<P>
This second paragraph is a blanket provision which was embodied
into the preamble after considerable debate. A number of States
insisted that nothing contained in the Convention could impinge
on the notion of sovereignty and therefore it was fallacious to
consider the need to reaffirm the principle of sovereignty of
States in the convention. But most of the developing States misinterpreted
this stand as a threat to this fundamental principle, a loophole
for the richer OECD States to stultify the development of the
poorer States.
<P>
As international concern for the environment increases, States
should move away from the primacy of the community of nations
and the primacy of government in stressing the paramount duty
of the heads of all States throughout the world to guarantee the
right to live in an environment fit to
<P>
sustain life. The negotiations for a Framework Convention on Climate
Change proved that the traditional concept of sovereignty remains
a formidable obstacle when tackling problems of an international
nature. These negotiations also brought to light an even greater
challenge to the traditional concept of State sovereignty which
is likely to cause a tremendous upheaval in the evolution of modern
International Law, as certain areas, although lying within the
territorial jurisdiction of a State, were identified to be of
international environmental concern the Amazon forest for instance
is an excellent example.
<H4><B>The sources of international environmental law</B></H4>

<P>
Although International Environmental Law, is still in an embryonic
stage, there exist various rules, standards and guidelines which
regulate to some extent the protection of areas beyond national
jurisdiction. The innovative nature of these rules is that they
are also preventive and precautionary besides being responsive.
<P>
In the <U>Antarctica Treaty</U> and the <U>Treaty on Principles
Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use
of Outer Space</U> the parties attempted in some way to regulate
the environment on a universal level and acknowledged that effective
results in protecting the international commons can only be achieved
through coordination between governments and other policy makers.
<P>
Two fundamental legal principles emerge from the Convention on
Marine Pollution from Land-Based Sources: first, the obligation
of States to protect the environment and their corresponding strict
liability and secondly the requirement to study alternative measures
for attaining environmental objectives.
<P>
<U>UNCLOS III</U> builds upon the principles found in the Stockholm
Declaration. It proposes a balance of interests by recognizing
that countries shall take all necessary measures &quot;to ensure
that activities under
<P>
their jurisdiction or control are so conducted as not to cause
damage by pollution to other States and that pollution arising
from incidents or activities under their jurisdiction or control
do not spread beyond the areas where they exercise sovereign rights
in accordance with the convention&quot;. The convention requires
environmental impact assessments of the potential effects, when
countries believe that their planned activities may cause substantial
pollution or harmful changes to the marine environment. It also
states that countries shall cooperate in studies, research, exchange
of information and data and in establishing appropriate scientific
criteria. It grants preferential treatment to developing countries
in the allocation of funds, technical assistance and specialized
services.
<P>
The &quot;<U>Convention on LongRange Transboundary Air Pollution
</U>&quot; defines 'air pollution' and 'long range transboundary
air pollution' for the purposes of the convention in its very
first article. These definitions are of fundamental importance
as they determine what falls within the ambit of international
law for the purposes of the convention. This definition takes
into consideration that pollution is transboundary if it has adverse
effects in other areas beyond the jurisdiction of the polluter
and:
<P>
it is not generally possible to distinguish the contribution of
individual
<P>
emission sources or groups of sources.
<P>
The Parties to the Convention based their considerations upon
the Declaration of the <U>UN Conference on the Human Environment
</U>particularly <U>Art.21</U>, namely, that States have the sovereign
right to exploit their natural resources according to their own
environmental policies and the responsibility not to cause damage
to the environment of other States or of areas beyond the limits
of national jurisdiction by activities carried out within their
jurisdiction or control. Although this ECE Convention dutifully
invokes <U>Principle 21</U> of the <U>Stockholm Declaration</U>in
its preamble, during the negotiations the Government of the Federal
Republic of Germany reportedly stipulated that preambles have
no force of law and that in any case it does not hold itself to
be legally bound by <U>Principle 21</U>. Another weakness in the
convention is the fact that it does not contain any rules on State
liability, but with regard to settlement of disputes, <U>Art.13
</U>states that:
<P>
If a dispute arises between two or more contracting parties to
the present convention as to the interpretation or application
of the convention, they shall seek a solution by negotiation or
by any other method of dispute settlement acceptable to the parties
to the dispute.
<P>
The Convention is the first international accord on air pollution,
its Chairman Johnson, hailed it as &quot;a breakthrough in the
development of International Environmental Law&quot; but not all
consider it so. It has been critizised because it includes no
mechanism for the enforcement of its terms, nor does it delineate
the responsibility of member States to abate pollution causing
damage in another State or to award compensation for such damage.
<P>
The <U>Vienna Convention on the Protection of the Ozone Layer
</U>sets down general principles and a series of specific protocols
including the <U>Montreal Protocol</U>. The Convention shows that
the international community is able to deal effectively on a multilateral
level with the serious problem of ozone depletion. in its preamble,
the <U>Vienna Convention</U> recalls <U>Principle 21</U> of the
<U>Stockholm Declaration</U>. It lays down a number of legal principles
which have come to be considered as the basics of International
Environmental Law.
<P>
Under the general obligations, the convention lays down that the
parties should cooperate in the scientific, technical and legislative
fields and requires the use of measures of a predetermined standard
to combat pollution, in particular the adoption of administrative
and legal measures. The Convention obliges countries to cooperate
in the formulation of agreed measures, standards and procedures
and with the competent international bodies. The Convention states
that developing nations are to receive information on alternative
technologies, necessary equipment, facilities for research and
training of scientific personnel. Perhaps this is one of the reasons
which made the <U>Vienna Convention</U> a success, because often
developing countries cannot afford to adopt new technical measures
due to financial problems. Receiving assistance from industrialised
countries would help them to overcome such difficulties.
<P>
The <U>Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone
Layer</U> (1987) has been described by US President Reagan as
a &quot;<U>monumental achievement</U>&quot; and by UNEP's director
Mostafa Tolba as &quot;<U>the beginning of a new era of environmental
statesmanship</U>&quot;. It is an agreement reached by representatives
of countries from every region of the world, an achievement which
has always been deemed to be impossible in the diplomatic sphere.
But it is remarkable mostly because of its preventive nature,
rather than its being simply a response to an environmental disaster
on a global scale, because the Protocol establishes international
controls on certain chemicals that destroy the stratospheric ozone
and aggravate the greenhouse effect. The parties not only established
controls with the full knowledge that these might have serious
repercussions on the chemical industry but also agreed upon target
dates for emissions reduction, even though technology has not
yet offered alternative solutions to be able to accomplish these
goals.
<P>
Amongst the emerging legal principles we find once again the recognition
of the transboundary nature of pollution. The protocol emphasizes
that States have the responsibility to prevent, minimise and eliminate
pollution from land based sources and it establishes joint programmes
of scientific and technical research to determine the best methods
of reducing pollution. As in the case of the Vienna Convention,
special attention was given to developing States. The Protocol
in fact entitles developing States to delay compliance with control
methods for ozone depletion, whilst promising them assistance.
<P>
Although at first negotiating parties were far apart in their
positions, political consensus was achieved as a result of the
development of a commonly accepted body of data and analysis.
The initial framework agreement in the <U>Vienna Convention on
the Protection of the Ozone Layer</U> provided a useful model.
It has helped governments to launch coordinated scientific research
which served as a guide to the formulation of a common policy.
The Protocol is a dynamic and flexible instrument with many innovative
features. There are provisions which represent creative resolutions
that can lead the way for the future protocols or resolutions,
<P>
such as the trigger mechanism for entry into force, fixed target
dates for reductions, twostage voting to reflect the large shareholders
interests and transitional provisions for developing countries.
The Protocol is not a static solution but an ongoing process.
The parties to the Protocol considered the risks of waiting for
more complete evidence to be too great. Consensus was achieved
irrespective of uncertainty which seems to be omnipresent in international
environmental relations. This global threat has demonstrated that
the international community is capable of accepting the common
responsibility to safeguard present and future generations and
of undertaking complex cooperative actions despite the ambiguity
of the situation. The <U>Montreal Protocol</U> serves as a prototype
for the development of new diplomatic approaches to emerging global
issues such as climate change. The problem of climate change is
even more complex than the protection of the ozone layer, because
there are more contributing factors, more wide ranging and uncertain
consequences and above all more economically painful choices.
The framework Convention on Climate Change provides for various
protocols which are likely to be negotiated in the near future.
It is through these protocols that adequate measures to protect
the climate would be formulated.
<P>
Besides these multilateral conventions there are also a number
of bilateral treaties or treaties between small groups of States.
These treaties are usually 'contractual' in nature, as opposed
to 'lawmaking treaties' which lay down rules of universal and
general application. Contractual treaties deal with special matters
concerning the parties exclusively but although not a direct source
of International law they may still have a lawmaking effect. Contractual
treaties in fact, may constitute 'particular rules' between the
parties, or contribute to the formation of international law by
establishing norms which may later crystallize into custom. Examples
of contractual treaties on pollution are: the <U>Nordic Convention
</U>signed by Scandinavian countries which provides a framework
for abatement and for compensatory relief for persons injured
by transboundary air or water pollution and the <U>Tripartite
Agreement</U> between the US, France and the UK.
<P>
Treaties concerning air pollution may be split into two groups.
There are treaties imposing obligations on a contracting party
to inform and consult with other States when activities within
the jurisdiction of the former cause harmful affects to the environment
of the latter or to the global commons. Such treaties lay down
coordinated research programs and data exchanges. An example would
be the <U>Convention on Long Range Transboundary Air Pollution
</U>(1979). Other treaties go one step further and include provisions
for settlement of disputes, such as the right of access to administrative
bodies or municipal courts. In other cases an impartial commission
is set up. This is mostly the case with bilateral agreements such
as the USCanadian Joint Commission. The <U>Vienna Convention of
the Protection of the Ozone Layer </U>(1985), belongs to the latter
category. There are two main queries regarding the position of
treaties in Public International Law. The first is whether treaties
are of legal significance only as between the parties and the
second is whether they play a role in the evolution of customary
law or whether they are declaratory of it.
<P>
It is always a problem to confirm whether a customary rule exists
or not in International Law, particularly when it comes to environmental
issues. The existence of a customary rule which regulates protection
of the environment, whether damage is transboundary or extraterritorial,
has always been traditionally based on the maxim &quot;sic utero
tuo ut alienum non laedas&quot;. However the legal nature of this
principle has at times been challenged by States as not being
legally binding. The <U>Trail Smelter Arbitration</U> case however
acknowledges this principle on the part of the sovereign State
not to use its territory to cause damage to another sovereign
State whilst the <U>Stockholm Declaration</U> adopted and elaborated
this obligation to include also these areas beyond national jurisdiction.
A useful antecedent for the formation of legal principles concerning
the protection of the environment on a global scale emerges from
the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in the <U>Corfu Channel
Case</U>, when it recognized that every State has the obligation
not to allow knowingly its territory to be used for acts contrary
to the rights of other States. In this context extra-territorial
spaces are also covered because these areas, although beyond national
jurisdiction, are the patrimony of the whole
<P>
international community. This is also the case with another emerging
legal principle, this time from the <U>Lake Lanoux Arbitration
</U>. The Tribunal in this case strived to achieve a balance between
rights and duties in international law, and established that a
State has a right to make use of its resources but not to the
extent of ignoring the rights of others.
<P>
Although in International Law the decisions of the ICJ and its
predecessor the PCIJ, are not considered as binding legal precedents
they are considered by international lawyers to be the expression
of what the most authoritative international judicial body holds
to be the position in International Law under those particular
circumstances. Even international arbitral tribunals commonly
act according to judicial principles rather than basing their
arbitral adjudications on a compromise. Besides all this, the
ICJ may play another role in the formation of International Law
through an advisory opinion sought by other UN organs. This would
prove to be very valuable particularly in the face of all the
uncertainty which surrounds the international legal principles
regulating the protection of those areas beyond national jurisdiction.
<P>
It is not my intention to enter into the merits of whether soft
law should be considered as a source of International Law or not.
Its importance however should not be undermined, particularly
during the negotiations for the drafting of multilateral treaty.
Principles embodied in UNGA resolutions or other declarations
emanating from international meetings have undisputable weight,
particularly when adopted unanimously. The notion of &quot;common
concern&quot; for example was at times attacked and a few delegations
sought its deletion from the draft text during the negotiating
sessions for a framework Convention on Climate Change. The very
fact that the climate had been unanimously acknowledged as a &quot;Common
Concern of Humankind&quot; in four consecutive UNGA resolutions
(43/53; 44/207; 45/212; 46/169), gave this new concept a special
status and, although not acknowledged as a substantive principle
of International Law, it was established as the first preambular
paragraph of the Convention on Climate Change. The Climate Convention
promotes
<P>
cooperation between States in taking measures to implement the
convention providing financial and technological assistance to
developing countries.
<P>
It has as its objective &quot;the stabilisation of greenhouse
gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent
dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.&quot;
<P>
The convention acknowledges the need that the parties &quot;should
take precautionary measures to anticipate, prevent or minimise
the causes of climate change and mitigate its adverse effects&quot;.
<P>
It is sad to note however that one of the basic rules and standards
in International Environmental Law, namely Principle 21 and 22
of the Stockholm Declaration have been embodied only in the preamble.
The Convention does not in fact account for liability elsewhere
except in this preambular paragraph:
<P>
Recalling that States have, in accordance with the Charter of
the United Nations and <U>The Principles of International Law
</U>, the sovereign right to exploit their own resources pursuant
to their own environmental and development policies, and the responsibility
to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction or control
do not cause damage to the environment of other States or of areas
beyond the limits of national jurisdiction.
<P>
The wording of the paragraph recognizes this right and duty to
be a principle of International Law. The parties however were
reluctant to include it in Article 3 as one of the principles
to the Convention.
<H4><B>State responsibility</B></H4>

<P>
The question of liability brings us to examine the notion of State
responsibility under International Environmental Law. The responsibility
of States for internationally wrongful acts arises out of the
nature of the international legal system.
<P>
The existing sources of International Environmental Law do imply
that there is an obligation upon States to protect the environment
of other States and also of the International Commons. Even if
there is no specific positive rule forbidding environmentally
harmful activities under International law, liability results
from the nonapplication of principles of a preventive character
and the obligation of international cooperation among States for
the protection of the environment. As International Environmental
Law evolved from various sources and State practice over these
last decades, it has begun to generate subsidiary principles of
behaviour in the environmental field that tend to have substantive
implications or effects. The main subsidiary norms can be grouped
thus:
<P>
(a) The duty to conduct environmental impact studies before launching
on a project that may adversely effect the environment.
<P>
(b) The duty to inform and consult other States which may have
an interest in the effects of a particular project or activity.
<P>
(c) The duty to warn other States in the event of an accident
with environmental implications.
<P>
(d) The duty to deal on the basis of nondiscrimination and equality,
with persons, whether, they are nationals or foreigners because
they may have an interest in some environmental question either
as victims after the event, or as individuals providing suggestions
on the prevention of environmental damage.
<P>
(e) The obligation to avoid harmful environmental damage has been
said to include also the obligation to take all the necessary
measures to ensure that activities within the jurisdiction or
control of a State conform to international rules and standards
for the protection of the environment of other States or areas
beyond national jurisdiction, as they arise from various treaties
dealing with the common waters, marine areas, outer space and
Antarctica.
<P>
However, it has never been put to test as to whether these norms
are considered to be binding among States. The Chernobyl Nuclear
Accident brought to light the inadequacy of International Law
on the subject. The existence of an international obligation upon
sovereign States to refrain from carrying out activities within
and outside their jurisdiction which might have an impact on extra
territorial spaces is likely to prove rather difficult to assert.
<H4><B>The Common Concern Concept</B></H4>

<P>
It is clear that the classical issues of State to State liability
and the traditional notion of legal standing under the present
system of International Law are inadequate to deal with the devastating
damage which State activities are causing in areas beyond national
jurisdiction. Such an issue, which concerns the very existence
of mankind and life as we know it on our planet, cannot remain
part of the &quot;reserved domain&quot; of States. It is on this
basis that the UNGA Resolution 43/53 recognises specifically that
Climate Change is a &quot;Common Concern of Mankind, since climate
is an essential condition which sustains life on earth.&quot;
<P>
The Maltese initiative to request the inclusion of the item entitled
&quot;<U>Conservation of Climate as part of the Common Heritage
of Mankind</U>&quot; in the provisional agenda of the 43rd Session
of the General Assembly, attracted widespread support both at
the General Assembly plenary meeting and at the 2nd Committee,
where Malta formally presented its draft resolution.
<P>
Malta's draft resolution was adopted in the 2nd Committee, following
some amendments which were acceptable to Malta. In fact, due to
the unhappy history of the 'Common Heritage' concept a number
of States objected to the idea of classifying climate as part
of the &quot;Common Heritage of Mankind&quot;. Malta's intentions
however were not to speak in terms of appropriation of any part
of the climate but in terms of protecting it. Its ultimate aim
was to ensure that by addressing the problem of climate change
on a multilateral basis, it would lead the international community
towards the formulation of an effective and comprehensive strategy
to protect the global climate from change as a result of State
activities. The Assembly's General Committee accepted Malta's
request and on the 6th December 1988, Resolution 43/53 entitled
&quot;<U>Protection of the Global Climate for Present and Future
Generations</U>&quot; was adopted unanimously in the plenary.
<P>
The international community sustained this innovative concept
and unanimously classified climate change as a Common Concern
of Mankind in the Resolution adopted by the General Assembly.
This concept of &quot;Common Concern&quot; is closely related
to other international concepts, such as the &quot;common interest&quot;,
the &quot;international commons&quot;, the concept of &quot;intergenerational
rights&quot; and to the concept of the &quot;Common Heritage of
Mankind&quot;. The latter concept has been incorporated in a 1979
agreement governing the <U>Activities of States on the Moon and
other Celestial Bodies </U>with respect to the moon and its natural
resources and in the 1982 <U>Convention on the Law of The Sea
</U>(UNCLOSIII) with respect to certain areas of the seabed, ocean
floor and subsoil. It has been applied to areas and resources
found outside the national jurisdiction of States, as it proposes
the common management of the earth's resources. But in the political
sphere it has always caused much debate and has also been defined
as &quot;a rush consent by the hungry, to gobble down sundry goods,
spread out on somebody's else's table.&quot;
<P>
Areas beyond national jurisdiction are certainly an integral part
of mankind's heritage. Such areas are a natural resource to be
utilised by all States but which cannot be abused or tampered
with to the detriment of
<P>
present and future generations. Consequently, it cannot be left
to individual States to unilaterally decide whether, and which,
conservation measures should be taken to protect them. The concept
of &quot;Common Heritage&quot; refers to &quot;patrimony&quot;,
whilst the term &quot;concern&quot; is more general. It speaks
of concerted action rather than benefit sharing: it is closer
to &quot;interest&quot; implying a series of rights and obligations.
<P>
The Common Concern concept is traceable in various Resolutions
and Declarations of the General Assembly. The debates of the UN
Charter speak of matters considered to be of &quot;international
jurisdiction because they are of an international concern.&quot;
In 1972, the <U>Stockholm Declaration on the Human Environment
</U>expressly referred to the &quot;common good of mankind.&quot;
Two years later the UN Charter on Economic Rights and Duties stressed
that &quot;the duty of protection and preservation of the environment
for present and future generations was the responsibility of all
States.&quot; In 1980, the General Assembly adopted a resolution
on the historic responsibility of States to protect the environment
for the benefit of present and future generations. In 1989, UNGA
Resolution 44/228 convened a UN Conference on Environment and
Development and the General Assembly pointed out that environmental
problems in their global dimension required action at all levels
involving the commitment and participation of all countries.
<P>
To understand the legal implications of the Common Concern concept,
it is necessary to analyse its two component elements. The first
element of &quot;common concern&quot; could be interpreted as
an analogous to the term &quot;common interest&quot;, which means
that the issue is a matter which concerns all States and all the
members of the world community. In the <U>Barcelona Traction Case
</U>, the ICJ held that there are two types of obligations under
International law those obligations arising between a number of
States because of some agreement considered to be binding, under
international law and <I>erga omnes</I> obligations. Defining
extra-territorial spaces as a &quot;Common Concern of Mankind&quot;
(as already is the case with Climate Change) implies that, any
obligations in this respect run <B>erga omnes</B>. The International
Law Commission itself, in its draft articles on State
<P>
Responsibility recognized the superiority of fundamental interests
of the international community, stating that the breach of an
international obligation, so essential for the protection of such
interests, constitutes an international crime. In <U>Art 19</U>of
the same draft, it stated that &quot;an international crime may
result inter alia from .....a serious breach of an international
obligation of essential importance for the safeguarding and preservation
of the human environment, such as prohibiting massive pollution
of the atmosphere or of the seas.&quot; Consequently, any State
should have a standing to make representations to any other State
concerning the latter's activities and policies which are harmful
to the human environment without having to allege that it is directly
affected.
<P>
This is in fact the position with respect to legal standing in
the case of pollution of the marine environment in the convention
on Marine Pollution from Land Based sources.
<P>
Any significant pollution of the marine environment is of concern
to all States. Any State may complain to the offending State or
to an appropriate international agency, against the violation
of generally accepted international rules and standards for the
protection of the marine environment by another State or its nationals
or ships.
<P>
The possibility of development of customary rules, that with respect
to the natural resources there exists a collective interest which
may be vindicated by any State, was mentioned by the International
Law Commission in its Draft on State Responsibility. This approach
links the whole issue of environmental protection with the protection
of human rights, also classified as an <I>erga omnes</I> obligation.
States have a legal standing in such cases even if events happening
within the jurisdiction of other States do not directly involve
or jeopardise their interests.
<P>
Defining areas beyond national jurisdiction as &quot;A Common
Concern of Mankind&quot; may also be interpreted as extending
the fundamental human right to life to include the right to a
healthy and safe environment. If this
<P>
aspect of the Common Concern concept is developed, it would also
be possible to say that there is a standing to complain about
prospective harm to extra territorial spaces anywhere in the world
by means of an <I>Actio Popularis<B>,</B></I> which under International
Law is only possible under <U>Art 24</U> of the <U>European Convention
on the Protection of Human Rights</U>. Although this would create
new problems with the possibility of over-zealous complaints,
such harm would be legitimised by broadened notions of standing
which is likely to create less harm than that which results from
activities which cannot effectively be challenged unless particularised
effects on individual States are apparent.
<P>
The second element &quot;Humankind&quot;, is more controversial
as it does not only refer to vindication for a collective interest
but also to the temporal aspect of the whole concept. The term
&quot;Humankind&quot; includes all those who influence international
decision-making: that is, not only governments but also NGOs,
citizen groups, the scientific community and public opinion.
<P>
The Common Concern concept has three facets. The spatial facet
implies that there must be co-operation between all States on
matters being similarly important to all nations and to the whole
international community. Another facet is the social aspect of
the concept. All structures of society are involved in the process
of combating global environmental threats, but legal guarantees
are also required to support it. The third facet is the temporal
aspect which is two-fold. Protection of the international environment
therefore, may be classified as an inter-generation right, described
as : &quot;the right of every human being and of all human beings
taken collectively&quot;. This aspect of the Common Concern concept
evokes the idea of &quot;public trust&quot; extending protection
to the beneficiaries of future generations in terms of International
Law, but the scope of this concept comprises the protection of
the well-being and viability of future generations.
<P>
These facets of the Common Concern concept can be traced in positive
International Environmental Law. The <U>World Heritage Convention
</U>of 1972, in its preamble, refers to &quot;the heritage of
all nations of the world.&quot; The <U>Convention on International
Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and</U>
<P>
<U>Fauna</U>, 1973 recognizes in the preamble that &quot;wild
fauna and flora... are an irreplaceable part of the natural system
of the earth which must be protected for this and the generations
to come.&quot;
<P>
The Commonwealth countries which represent one fourth of the world's
population in the <U>Langkawi Summit</U> of October 1989, expressed
their deep concern &quot;at the serious deterioration of the environment
and the threat this poses to the well-being of the present and
future generations&quot;, and also that the &quot;current threat
to the environment which is a common concern of all mankind, stems
essentially from past neglect in managing the natural environment
and resources.&quot;
<P>
The wide application of this new notion in International Law by
the world community reflects a consensus which in the long run
may reach an <B>opinio iuris</B> on the applicability of the concept
to a wide range of global environmental issues. The <U>Declaration
of the UNGA Special Session on Development and Co-operation</U>states:
<P>
The current threat to the environment is the common concern of
all. All countries should take effective measures for the protection
and enhancement of the environment, in accordance with their respective
capacities and responsibilities and taking into account the specific
needs of developing countries.
<P>
The provisions of this declaration might serve as a description
of the common concern concept as it includes important aspects
essential to the concept itself. These are:
<P>
1. Sustainable Development
<P>
2. Subsequent Rights and Obligations
<P>
3. Inter-relations between developed and developing States.
<P>
Also when one analyses all these international documents which
have referred to the concept, it is evident that the notion of
&quot;common concern of mankind&quot; serves as a consolidating
factor between all the countries of the world despite the geographical,
economic and political differences existing between them. This
obligation to co-operate should involve all countries and all
levels of concerted actions; the concept of ecological interdependence
has obtained not only spatial but also temporal parameters. The
concept of common concern should develop into a principle which
allows the international community to act on matters which are
of common interest. The principle of domestic jurisdiction can
no longer be allowed to be used as a defence when the global well-being
is at stake. The joint efforts of governments, the scientific
community, legal experts and the public opinion are of crucial
importance for the concept of &quot;Common Concern of Humankind&quot;,
such that it does not remain a vague political formula but should
be interpreted in terms of legal rights and duties, to become,
for the international community, a source of action-oriented,
binding obligations.
<P>
The object of International Environmental Law is to regulate inter-State
relations or the activities of International Organizations, which
involve environmental issues. As we have seen, the current situation
however, does not adequately regulate State activities which have
a harmful effect on the international commons. The magnitude of
the problem requires the development of innovative, legal and
conventional proposals to meet this threat facing humankind. Despite
the widespread recognition of the catastrophic effects on these
areas, this is far from an easy task, particularly because of
the very nature of International Law.
<P>
The methodology adopted to implement these goals must be framed
in such a way as to gain the adherence of a large number and a
balanced range of States. It might include the adoption of uniform
standards or choosing flexible approaches to accommodate developing
States, such as transferable allowances and incentives.
<P>
Environmental damage to areas beyond national jurisdiction would
affect directly or indirectly all strata of society. The international
community therefore should continue to strive towards a broader
understanding of the issue, so as to facilitate the adoption and
the implementation of an effective and comprehensive legal strategy
intended to protect the very existence of life on earth.
<P>
&quot;No species has ever had such wholesale control over everything
on earth, living or dead as we now have. That lays upon us, whether
we like it or not an awesome responsibility. In our hands now
lies not only our own future, but that of all other living creatures
with whom we share the earth.&quot;<A NAME="reference"></A><HR>

<H3><B>DISCUSSION</B></H3>

<P>
<B>Professor Attard</B> said the two Maltese proposals are complementary
because the proposed group would identify and assess the environment
of extra-territorial spaces whilst the Trusteeship Council would
be given the task to protect them.
<P>
<B>Dr. Boldirev</B> noted that, as the Trusteeship Council proposal
is a Maltese initiative, the steps envisaged in the first paper
could be undertaken by the Maltese Government without the Rio
Conference's endorsement. But where does the group of eminent
persons fit in?
<P>
<B>Professor Attard </B>explained that the two concepts are indeed
complementary but should be dealt with separately during a first
stage. They should not be dependent on each other because if one
does not materialise, this should not affect the other.
<P>
<B>Dr. Boldirev</B> noted that in this case the Colloquium could
reaffirm its support for the group of eminent persons and also
support the Trusteeship Council initiative.
<P>
<B>Professor Attard </B>suggested that one could go one step further
and add that in its discussions the group could also consider
the possible role of the Trusteeship Council.
<P>
<B>Dr. Boldirev</B> proposed the following:
<P>
1. In respect of Prof Attard's proposal, if such a group is to
be established, then it should be &quot;in consultation with ther
executive heads of the other specialised agencies concerned&quot;.
<P>
2. With respect to the Trusteeship Council proposal, in the second
paragraph there is mention of assistance. This should be changed
to &quot;scientific and technical advice and any assistance...&quot;
<P>
<B>Dr. Keckes</B> said that most of the problems in extra-territorial
spaces have their origins in national jurisdictions. Control here
is within the hands of governments. Thus what would be the best
strategy to follow?
<P>
1. Demonstrate that there is a real problem with solid arguments.
<P>
2. Identify problems of spaces, activities and resources which
are beyond national jurisdiction in one respect but within it
as regards others in a limited way. (Some are of the opinion that
these have already been identified).
<P>
3. Create a very competent group of people to prompt the United
Nations General Assembly into action. This would necessitate a
variegated composition of the group which should include legal
experts as well as scientists and specialists in other fields.
For many studies separate groups would be necessary which in some
cases already exist.
<P>
4. Try to merge the advice obtained from the experts into political
action. Here someone has to examine the adequacy of existing law
and judge what has to be done.
<P>
How to get it done is the diplomatic process but this should be
separate from the legal and scientific approach.
<P>
<B>Mr. Savior Borg</B> said that the transformation of the Trusteeship
Council would necessitate amending the UN Charter which is obviously
very difficult.
<P>
<B>Professor Kappeler</B> noted that what was being proposed merged
beautifully together. The group of eminent persons could be the
perfect people to see where the advice is located and how to obtain
it.
<P>
<B>Professor Birnie</B> asked how the group of eminent persons
is to be funded and how the role of the Trusteeship Council could
be changed without amending the Charter?
<P>
<B>Mr. Saviour Borg </B>said that the three stage approach he
had suggested might help in paving the way for overcoming the
final difficulty of amending the Charter.
<P>
<B>Professor Attard</B> noted that if the General Assembly decides
to set up the group a budgetary provision would be made for it.
<P>
<B>Professor Birnie</B> suggested that UNCED should prove to be
a very fertile ground for other proposals.
<P>
<B>Professor Attard </B>asked Dr. Boldirev whether member States
would have the capacity to request the Secretary General of the
World Meteorological Organization to produce a study on the atmospheric
environment of the extra-territorial spaces.
<P>
<B>Dr. Boldirev</B> answered that if a statement is requested
the Executive Council of the Organization would definitely have
to be involved, but if the requeste comes from a State, one would
have to see. Whatever proposal will be endorsed by Rio and accepted
by the General Assembly, this would help the aim of this Colloquium.
Should everything fail the group of eminent persons would remain
the only available option. The Colloquium could suggest that:
<P>
1. A high level organ of the UN be made to support the proposal
to appoint a group of eminent persons;
<P>
2. The proposal to enlarge the mandate of the Trusteeship Council
should be considered.
<P>
<B>Professor Attard</B> was of the opinion that a group of persons
with special expertise in their field was necessary to produce
a report and to ascertain whether there is a problem and whether
it should be tackled or not.
<P>
<B>Professor Birnie</B> suggested that any conclusion should take
into account that:
<P>
1. Further studies are required urgently.
<P>
2. This is a very complex problem.
<P>
3. Any initiative for such a study should be endorsed but one
cannot neglect any of the various proposals being made.
<P>
A draft conclusion was then proposed by <B>Professor Kappeler
</B>and circulated for consideration by the participants.

<B>Subject</B>: The Diplomacy of protecting the Environment beyond
National Jurisdiction<A NAME="mark1"></A><HR>

<H3><B>Professor Kappeler presents his paper on the subject:</B>
</H3>

<H3><B>Introduction</B></H3>

<P>
 Spaces beyond the limits of national jurisdiction are land, sea
and air spaces as well as outer space<A HREF="#endnotes" >(1)  
</A>. The only land space within this category is the Antarctic
continent, removed from national jurisdiction by the Antarctica
Treaty. Sea spaces are the maritime surfaces beyond territorial
seas and the seabed beyond the limits of the continental shelves.
Air space beyond national jurisdiction is the air space covering
land and sea spaces which are themselves beyond national jurisdiction.
The delimitation of outer space with regard to air space is controversial.
<P>
Antarctica has no territorial neighbours, so that protection of
its land surfaces, territorial waters and continental shelf is
obviously a common concern, not only of the parties to the Antarctica
Treaty but of humanity in general, as shown by the impact of the
yearly ozone hole that appears over the continent. Favourable
and unfavourable impacts on the maritime and atmospheric environment
tend to circulate freely, being carried onwards by maritime currents
and atmospheric winds. They may produce their effects in places
far removed from their origin.
<P>
In consideration of the above, it is obvious that no single State,
no bilateral arrangement will be able to protect the environment
beyond the limits of national jurisdiction with any effectiveness.
Only multilateral treaties imposing rules on all concerned, which
often means the international community as a whole, can provide
effective protection. This is why the Rio Conference has been
convened. Within the framework of global conventions, regional
and subregional arrangements may be possible and even desirable,
and within both global and regional or subregional frameworks
bilateral arrangements may make sense or even be necessary. One
may mention here the need of environmental clauses in bilateral
agreements on development cooperation.
<P>
The diplomacy of protecting the environment beyond the limits
of national jurisdiction is thus inevitably multilateral. This
means that the possibilities of individual actors, even big and
powerful ones, are limited. Moreover, the subject-matter, i.e.
protection of the environment, means that cooperation of all concerned,
the willing and the unwilling ones, is required to produce the
desired result. It will not suffice to draft nice treaties that
States will be free to ratify or accede to or not. Only treaties
which will be ratified or acceded to by all concerned will be
useful. This will immensly complicate negotiations. There are
of course treaties that anyone will accept to become party to
because they only contain pious recommendations and platitudes,
are so vague that eveyone can interpret provisions to suit his
purposes, and lack any form of sanction. This again will not do
because the desired effect will then not be achieved. One might
as well forgo the costly exercise of convening lengthy international
conferences if the result will only be this.
<P>
This paper considers the preparation of environmental negotiatons,
the required briefs, the actual negotiating process as well as
the drafting of the treaties which should be the outcome of such
negotiations. This is being done with special regard to the issue
at hand: the protection of the environment beyond the limits of
national jurisdiction.
<H4><B>Preparing the negotiators</B></H4>

<P>
Grounding in international law
<P>
Desirable negotiators for our purpose should have a solid background
in international law, both as regards its principles and with
respect to State practice, past and present. This is essential
if treaties negotiated are to be easy to understand, do not offer
loopholes permitting escape from apparently binding obligations,
and provide the kind of sanctions that will ensure their actual
implementation by the parties. Special familiarity will be required
with international environmental law, as this is the branch of
international law which deals with the regulation of often complex
scientific issues in a manner that will ensure that they are properly
handled.
<P>
Grasp of scientific issues
<P>
Understanding of the scientific issues involved is also essential.
This does not only mean some failiarity with terms like global
warming, climate change, ozone layer depletion, maintaining of
biological diversity. It means that the issues and principles
underlying these terms must be grasped, so that even the course
of scientific argumentation can be understood. Of course there
will be scientists available as consultants<A HREF="#endnotes" >(2)  
</A>. But their explanations and advice can only be understood
if the diplomat has a general grasp of the issues discussed. Scientific
knowledge is all the more important as there are constant attempts
at demagogic obfuscation, using isolated bits of evidence to defeat
those who argue for concerted action against such matters as the
use of fluorcarbones or the uncontrolled escape of sulphuric gases.
One should be able to understand for example how the penetration
of volcanic dust from the recent Pinatubo eruption produces a
layer that prevents the effects of global warming from being felt
for several years.
<P>
Understanding of environmental diplomacy
<P>
Just as essential as familiarity with underlying scientific issues
is an understanding of the peculiarities of environmental diplomacy.
There is for instance the economic aspect. Countries are asked
to forgo some types of development because of its negative ecological
implications. Tropical countries are asked to stop overexploiting
and burning down virgin tropical forests and to replant exploited
surfaces in the interest of humanity, much of which lives a lot
better than their own population. Conversely, developed countries
are asked to pay penalties for having spoilt the world environment
during their own industrialisation, including where, at the time
of the damage, the environmental implications were unknown. Proposing
and promoting global solidarity that would lead to a generally
acceptable form of burden sharing must be done in a manner that
carries conviction and does not sound like lofty preaching of
the rich to the poor or the supposedly victimised poor to the
rich.
<P>
Levels and institutions of training
<P>
This raises the question of how environmental diplomats can be
produced and traditional diplomats can be re-trained for the purposes
of environmental diplomacy. The answer varies to some extent according
to the countries concerned. In a country like the USA, Japan or
even China, where a great number of persons should be trained
or re-trained, national programmes can easily be worked out with
the cooperation of a plethora of qualified scientific and ordinary
training institutions. At the other end of the scale, we have
small and often poor countries, mini-States with minuscule diplomatic
services. These must obviously rely on facilities elsewhere to
enhance the preparedness of their diplomats. But would the Maldives
wish to train their diplomats in the USA, when their basic concern
is physical survival of their islands in rising sea-levels, whereas
the US economy is likely to be very adversely affected by most
measures taken to reduce global warming?
<P>
It is in this context that regional training facilities can be
of considerable help. They can produce programmes tailored to
the requirements of different types of countries. At the same
time, by bringing together diplomats from a number of countries
with similar or differing outlooks and aims, they can provide
a forum for sharpening conceptions and approaches or, in the case
of diplomats from countries with different outlooks, they can
help to promote better mutual understanding. With time permitting,
certain types of negotiations could even be simulated, thus providing
participants with better views of the kind of outcome that could
be expected. UNITAR is currently seeking to promote programmes
for the training of environmental negotiators. In so doing it
is considering the differing needs and goals of various types
of countries and attempting to devise different programmes tailored
to their needs. This could be pushed further by deliberately bringing
together diplomats from countries with very antagonistic approaches,
e.g. least developed tropical countries and OECD countries of
some size. In a quasi-academic environment such diplomats could
for once speak freely and, after having done so, seek ways of
solving their differences without having to consider narrow national
interests.
<H4><B>Briefs</B></H4>

<P>
National briefs
<P>
When preparing for any type of environmental negotiation, each
country has of course to prepare a national brief. This brief
will contain as precise as possible an assessment of the country's
ecological situation, of the causes of degradation and damage,
of the type of action required and the forseeable cost of preventing
further damage and remedy existing degradation. It will then consider
how the required action can be exercised. In the case of the environment
beyond the limits State jurisdiction, any action that can be expected
to be effective will have to be multilateral. In closed or nearly
closed regional environments such as the Mediterranean, considerable
useful
<P>
action can be taken by the regional countries. Regarding global
issues, only the combined efforts of the international community
as a whole can bring remedy. This means that national briefs must
assess the manner in which alliances could be forged to promote
common causes and defeat negative policies of others. Sub-briefs
must be prepared for the requisite preliminary bilateral and multilateral
contacts aiming at building up the necessary alliances.
<P>
Let's take the extreme case of the Maldives. Their very physical
survival is menaced by the expected rise of the sea level as a
result of the global warming process. The only remedy available
to the country itself would be the building of dykes to protect
their islands from being flooded into extinction. Such remedial
action is clearly beyond the means of the country. Thus the national
brief would have to stress the need of strong measures to slow
down and possibly reverse global warming with a view to delaying
and possibly even preventing the previsible catastrophe. Allies
would have to be sought among countries with similar plights such
as Bangladesh and the Netherlands. Together such particularly
menaced countries might conceivably persuade a larger group of
others that it would be cheaper for the international community
in the long run to slow down, stop and reverse global warming
than to face the exorbitant costs of remedial action once the
sea level starts to rise significantly.
<P>
Group briefs
<P>
In environmental matters the traditional groups, mainly based
on geography, will often not have a common interest. If we take
Africa, its landlocked countries are not affected by the rising
of the sea level. Only adverse effects of global warming on their
climate would awaken their concern with the phenomenon. Thus new
alliances, cutting accross traditional groupings and whose members
may be spread far apart over the globe are likely to emerge. To
be able to properly influence the outcome of global negotiations,
such groups will have to consider the likely attitude of other
groups and the kind of deals that might induce them to accept
compromises they would otherwise
<P>
reject. Such alliances are already in evidence as the Rio Conference
approaches and preparatory work progresses. But one wonders whether
this evolution is always clearly understood and assessed. Let's
just consider a few likely groups whose common interest is strongly
affected by global issues:
<P>
a. Countries with tropical forests: All of them are over-exploiting
these forests and in many the forests will disappear in the near
future. These countries are asked to cut down or even forgo exploitation
in the interests of humanity, which needs those &quot;global lungs&quot;
to prevent further accumulation of carbon dioxide and possibly
reduce the atmospheric content of this gas in the long run. These
countries feel that they are in a strong position to exact compensation
from the rest of the world and particularly the rich countries.
They tend to overlook the fact that the destruction of their forests
is an ecological desaster for themselves and their own population
as well and represents in many cases the loss of one of the country's
major sources of income.
<P>
b. Archipelagos and continental countries with low coastal
<P>
areas, especially if these are heavily populated, have a vital
<P>
interest in fighting global warming and the consequent rise of
<P>
sea levels. Some such countries are quite rich while others
<P>
are among the poorest of the world. But the group cannot
<P>
produce remedial action on its own. It must persuade all
<P>
other nations that the effects of global warming will be
<P>
generally more detrimental than helpful. In so doing the
<P>
group must realise that certain regions of the globe might
<P>
actually benefit from global warming and that the countries
<P>
situated there may be aware of this or will certainly realise
<P>
the fact in the very near future.
<P>
c. Countries menaced by desertification may or may not derive
some benefit from global warming. In most cases, desertification
is likely to be accelerated and such countries would be natural
allies of group (b). The others are likely to form a separate
group asking for consideration of the economic impact for them
of forgoing possible benefits of global warming.
<P>
d. A number of countries, both among the most developed (USA)
and those embarking on forced development (China) are reticent
to fight global warming. They do not feel that it would affect
them very adversely, wherea the cost of measures to reduce production
of carbon dioxide and sulphurous gases by their often oldfashioned
industrial complexes are staggering. Some of the countries in
this group may be able to make a case for obtaining economic compensation
for undertaking remedial action. Others, especially the USA, clearly
cannot do so.
<P>
So far we have considered alliances that are likely to be stable.
But there will be others that will only form occasionally around
a specific issue like the conservation an protection of fishing
grounds, whereas their members may very much disagree on others.
Developing countries are claiming that much of the emissions which
are causing global warming are the result of early industrialisation
processes in Europe and North America, at a time when they themselves
had no industries whatsoever and were mostly under-populated.
As a result they feel that industrialised countries should first
pay for the damage they did in the past before asking for economic
sacrifices by the developing world. But in matters of conserving
tropical forests or preventing global warming these same developing
countries are often far from united.
<H4><B>The negotiating process</B></H4>

<P>
The overall approach
<P>
Regulating the environmental situation beyond the limits of national
jurisdiction is a job that can only be tackled collectively. Thus
all countries concerned must seek solutions that they can accept
together. This means that only the package approach used initially
at the Law of the Sea Conference can be conducive to positive
results. Consequently, regulations must be adopted as a whole
and by consensus, so that each individual State and each group
of States with a special interest has a stake in their being actually
observed.
<P>
Stages of negotiation
<P>
Experience of the last few years shows that there is much merit
in having environmental issues identified for regulation discussed
at a preliminary meeting of expert scientists. Their findings
help environmental diplomats to identify those points where the
present state of the art allows precise conclusions and projections
and those where a degree of uncertainty or even wide divergence
among opinions still exist. In this last case it may be preferable
to postpone the drafting of rules until more certainty has been
achieved, as negotiators will inevitably exploit divergent scientific
conclusions in order to pick out the ones which favour their country's
or their group of countries' position.
<P>
The preparation of the Rio Conference shows us that a meeting
of plenipotentiaries empowered to sign a convention should be
presented with drafts that enjoy wide consensus achieved in earlier
discussions at expert level. In this context we mean by &quot;experts&quot;
diplomats rather than scientists. These diplomats would be the
ones who have undergone special training and briefing before tackling
their task, whereas the plenipotentiaries at the final conference
may be more inclined to consider national political and economic
<P>
interests rather than the future of humanity as a whole. What
negotiating may have to be left to the final conference would
be the conciliation of powerful group interests that may imply
concessions that diplomatic experts at preparatory meetings were
in no position to make.
<P>
Especially because of the last point mentioned, the final conference
should be composed of delegations enjoying full powers to adopt
decisions with far-reaching effects for their country. This may
mean that senior decision-makers and even heads of State or government
would have to attend. Moreover they should be made aware of the
need of having gone through sufficient consultation and concertation
processes at home to be able to make instant decisions which would
have a good chance of being ratified by the competent organs in
their country.
<H4><B>Drafting of treaties</B></H4>

<P>
Substantive clauses
<P>
Such clauses must be clear and unequivocal. Differences cannot
be allowed to be overcome by adopting wordings that can be interpreted
by each side according to its own views and preferences. Where
&quot;soft law&quot; is stated it must be done in such a manner
as to ensure that States will actually have to do their utmost
to implement its exhortations and cannot get away with claiming
that their economic situation or other circumstances prevent them
from taking any meaningful action.
<P>
Particular care must be given to ensure that versions in different
languages actually say the same thing. Evasive action by relying
on divergent interpretations based on a lack of concordance of
treaty texts must be effectively prevented.
<P>
The texts adopted by the final conference must be definitive and
complete. The practice followed by the Law of the Sea Conference
which gave the drafting committee a mandate to review certain
clauses should not be followed. The issues at hand when dealing
with the global environment are of such momentous importance that
many countries would be only too happy to seize the pretext of
a drafting committee having gone beyond its mandate to go back
on their consent. And this of course would in most cases make
the whole attempt at regulation useless.
<P>
Only reservations discussed and approved by the final conference
should be permitted and participating States should openly undertake
not to seek to dilute their undertaking by means of additional
reservations or so-called interpretative statements. The convention
should clearly state that such reservations and statements will
be without effect.
<P>
Dealing with disputes
<P>
Problems that must be settled may consist of bona-fide difficulties
in interpreting certain clauses inspite of careful drafting, or
they may arise out of conflicts of interests which are not rooted
in the text of the treaty as such. Especially in the last case,
much freedom should be available to parties to the conflict for
attempting to settle it by negotiations and other consensual means.
It is less clear whether allowance should be made for agreements,
where a conflict has been finally decided, to amend the content
of this decision, as this may give rise to new problems and controversies.
<P>
Because rules governing the global environment or the environment
of a specific region can only work when all countries concerned
abide by them, conventions setting up such rules must provide
for a compulsory way of settling disputes if all other attempts
at solving them have failed. Moreover provision must be made for
enforcement should one of the parties concerned refuse to abide
by the compulsory settlement.
<P>
Entry into force
<P>
Countries which are not happy with the final outcome of a negotiation
dealing with the global environment may be tempted to delay ratification
or accession in order not to have to implement clauses they dislike.
Such attitudes are much in evidence as reagrds the Law of the
Sea Convention. It might be useful therefore to attempt to introduce
clauses in treaties dealing with the environment beyond the limits
of State jurisdiction which provide for provisional implementation
pending ratification or accession. In this manner all countries
concerned would have to begin with the implementation of at least
the essential clauses of the treaty, however long they delay the
constitutional steps leading to full expression of consent to
be bound.
<H4><B>Concluding remarks</B></H4>

<P>
More even than when attending meetings of collective organs of
international institutions, State representatives negotiating
rules for the protection of the environment beyond the limits
of national jurisdiction are in fact participants in a community
effort. All national and group interests must be subordinated
to the overall purpose of the negotiation and interpreted in that
light. This, for many diplomats, will constitute a considerable
departure from attitudes they are accustomed to and for which
indeed they may have been specifically trained. But only the full
realisation and conscious adoption of the required attitude will
allow any significant progress in adopting rules that preserve
the global environment for future generations.
<P>
In order to produce the kind of diplomat required for environmental
negotiations curricula for training and re-training diplomats
at national and regional levels must be reviewed. A habit must
be generated to consider the common interest before examining
in what way national interests can be made to fit into it. This,
to some extent, is quite a reversal of traditional attitudes.
But as the world shrinks, multilateral diplomacy will ever more
resemble parliamentary deliberations at the national level.
<P>
Very small and/or poor countries face a special plight when entering
important environmental negotiating processes. They cannot afford
to use the sort of experts that are found in delegations of larger
countries, and indeed such experts may not be available to them
even at home. The only remedy to their plight appears to be a
sharing of resources. Small countries with similar problems, e.g.
small island States, could share the same experts and thus have
access to the kind of knowledge easily available to bigger delegations.
<A NAME="mark3"></A><HR>

<H3><B>DISCUSSION</B></H3>

<P>
<B>Mr. Micallef</B> suggested that in addition to legal and scientific
knowledge the environmental diplomat should also have a sound
knowledge of the workings of his country's administrative processes
in order to be credible. This means that the diplomat should have
had a long exposure to those processes.
<P>
<B>The Chairman</B> wondered if managerial knowledge might help
in this regard.
<P>
<B>Dr. Pernetta</B> pointed out the difficulties of getting sound
scientific advice. In his view even the International Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC) is flawed by the fact that scientists sitting
on it are government appointees and thus not free to voice scientific
views which clash with government policies. Moreover scientists
hardly ever agree fully on the scientific interpretations of a
phenomenon. Their advice should therefore be considered in the
light of these shortcomings. In the case of small countries not
only the diplomats but also the experts must have a broad knowledge
as specialists in a number of fields may not be available. It
is regrettable in this regard that the Alliance of Small Island
States is content to be a pressure group. It should consider setting
up a scientific secretariat able to properly brief its various
members.
<P>
<B>Mr. Mifsud Bonnici</B> noted that environmental diplomacy may
already be an obsolete notion, as current emphasis is on combining
environmental and development issues.
<P>
<B>Professor Attard</B> wondered what the alternative to government-appointed
scientists on the IPCC would be. States will only act on advice
proffered if their governments are involved. Even when acting
only as a pressure group, the Alliance of Small Island States
has managed to exert much more influence than the combined weight
of its members would normally warrant. As regards experts working
for small delegations, one must realise that there are already
firms and other entities which simultaneously advise a considerable
number of delegations, as a result of which they may influence
the outcome of a negotiation more than might be acceptable.
<P>
<B>Mr. Micallef</B> felt that good relations between the administrations
in charge of environmental matters and the foreign service would
be a considerable asset.
<P>
<B>Professor Birnie</B> wondered whether instead of concentrating
on the training of diplomats one should not consider more urgently
the provision of diplomatic knowledge to the numerous officials
of technically competent ministries which tend to lead delegations
to international conferences on their own.
<P>
<B>Professor Kappeler</B> noted that this issue has already been
given a lot of consideration by training institutions, some of
which have admitted officials from ministries very active in external
relations to their regular training courses. Another possibility
is the organisation of short ad hoc training courses tailored
to the needs of individual ministries.
<P>
<B>Professor Attard</B> noted that when the moment comes to negotiate
issues of key importance for States, diplomats tend always to
replace experts from other administrations who might previously
have attended discussions.

<B>Chair</B>: Professor Kappeler
<P>
<B>Subject</B>: Adoption of a preliminary report with conclusions
and closing of the Colloquium
<P>
The Chairman guided participants through the draft document which
had been circulated to them. A number of amendments were proposed
and accepted. As time did not suffice, the Chairman suggested
that participants submit such further amendments as they might
wish to suggest in writing. For this purpose the revised document
was circulated after the end of the Colloquium.
<P>
The Chairman then welcomed Dr. Stanley Zammit, Parliamentary Secretary
for the Environment and invited him to deliver the closing speech.
<A NAME="mark1"></A><HR>

<H3><B>CLOSING SPEECH BY THE PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY IN THE MINISTRY
OF THE ENVIRONMENT, THE HON.DR. STANLEY ZAMMIT M.D, M.P.</B></H3>

<P>
Mr. Chairman, distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen. I
have been informed of and followed with great interest the deliberations
made during this colloquium and I am indeed, to say the least,
surprised with certain data which your good work has unfolded.
Information of this nature is the one which has set the world
community to think about our future as well as that of generations
to come.
<P>
A marked difference is easily noticeable from the results of colloquia
such as this and other international fora where the representative
delegates are more often than not faced with the laborious task
of reaching compromises with the obvious resultant effects. In
meetings such as this, however, the personal views of the participants
have a key role and do in fact provide the opportunity to discuss
issues which are not on the agenda of international meetings.
This forum again departs from the necessary formalities of international
conventions by successfully hosting a dialogue between the scientist
and the drafter. The scientist who, alarmed by the findings of
certain data and who logically expects an immediate action to
halt further harm to the environment, is more often than not overwhelmed
by the number of hurdles which obstruct his path: development,
politics, negotiations and funding among many others. Indeed the
dangers unfolded by the scientist must necessarily be given a
meaning by enacting legislation which would create sanctions against
the promoting of such dangers. The drafter's role then becomes
indispensable. He is the representative, the lawyer and the negotiator
of his country faced with various issues which present themselves
as hurdles to the creation of a legally binding instrument, possibly
the same obstacles faced by the technical person whose preoccupations
would have, by then, reached unprecedented dimensions.
<P>
We all know and understand the difficulties present in the creation
of international treaties and it comes as no surprise that a number
of these instruments are devoid of any sanctions against an offending
party. However at this late hour, should we not be less concerned
about issues of sovereignty beyond the areas of national jurisdiction?
Recent history of mankind has proved beyond any doubt that activities
within areas of national jurisdiction are the main source of damage
to the environment of those extraterritorial spaces. That which
occurs within the areas of national domain and which is harmful
to the environment without, is of common concern of mankind a
phrase which has bounced back and forth within the four walls
of this same venue. In UNEP's Meeting of Senior Government Officials
Expert in Environmental Law held in Rio de Janeiro in October/November,
1991, some of the delegates put forward a proposal to include
in UNEP's programme for this decade, the development of legislation
against environmental crime.
<P>
The Kuwaiti oil wells set on fire before the withdrawal of Iraqi
troops and the deliberate spillage of oil in the Gulf were all
too recent examples of voluntary damage to the environment which
inspired, indeed motivated, this proposal. I was informed however,
that other delegations turned down this idea on the basis that
UNEP should not be concerned with the laws of war and that other
remedies exist for such eventualities. If I may be allowed to
speak with the same frankness as you have been doing in these
past two days, I do not share the same opinion on the matter and
I do believe that the time is ripe to move towards the concept
of accountability a concept which relies heavily on the work of
the diplomat for its success, for it will have to break the old
traditions of sovereignty in some degree or other.
<P>
You have been discussing the Legal Protection of the Environment
Beyond the Limits of National Jurisdiction and it results quite
clearly that the protection of the environment immediately addresses
the issue of effectiveness or otherwise of present legislation.
But, to borrow a few lines from our mutual friend Dr. Tolba, there
is a tendency to measure success in the field of environmental
law more in terms of legal acts than in terms of actually improving
the environment. The most basic question in this regard was whether
the situation on the ground was better now or at least likely
to be better than it was before the signing of a convention. Dr.
Tolba was quoted as saying in the Rio Conference that in the last
Governing Council of UNEP he was forced to conclude that &quot;the
efficiency and effectiveness of environmental legal regulations
leaves much to be desired&quot;. Where does this take us, ladies
and gentlemen? I must admit that I am happy to hear of an alternative
which could implement the work achieved to date. I say &quot;implement&quot;
because I believe that all that has been achieved to date, with
all its merits and demerits, should not go to waste. It is not
a matter of starting afresh but rather of finding other methods
of enhancement.
<P>
You have dealt with the subject of environmental diplomacy an
alternative which is of recent origin and which I believe to be
an indispensable tool for the creation of mechanisms for the protection
of the environment beyond the areas of national jurisdiction.
This meeting has given due recognition of the need to resort to
this new area. The environmental diplomat must be trained to bring
together the various facets involved not only in negotiating treaties
of environmental nature but also be instrumental in implementing
notions of accountability of States towards environmental issues.
<P>
In bringing an end to this colloquium, may I thank you for having
devoted so much of your precious time to bring forward your knowledge
and experience.
<P>
As one of the speakers stated, a good lawyer always starts by
a quoting an excerpt from some literature. Well, I am not a lawyer,
but I will quote Tennyson who said in one of his works that &quot;the
old order do the change the yielding place to new&quot;. If this
were a fact in Tennyson's time then it is a perplexing uncertainty
today and should commit the world community to strive in order
to save the environment for the future generations.
<P>
Ladies and Gentlemen, I bring this meeting to an end and I thank
you again for your valuable endeavour.
<P>
After the speech the Chairman thanked Dr. Zammit in the name of
the participants. He also congratulated and thanked the latter
for the important work they did over the two days of the Colloquium.

<H3><B>SUMMARY REPORT AND CONCLUSIONS</B></H3>

<P>
The Colloquium was convened by the Mediterranean Academy of Diplomatic
Studies and co-sponsored by the Graduate Institute of International
Studies in Geneva. The organiser and convenor was David J. Attard,
UNEP Professor of Environmental Diplomacy at the Academy.
<P>
The Colloquium considered the following agenda:
<P>
1. Which are the spaces beyond national jurisdiction?
<P>
2. Scientific aspects of environmental degradation and remedies
for it.
<P>
3. The current status of the law relating to environmental protection
in general and in the Mediterranean in particular.
<P>
4. Strategies likely to produce international regimes and mechanisms
for the future.
<P>
5. The role of diplomacy in implementing effective legal environmental
protection.
<P>
The Colloquium noted that most environmental processes transcend
the distinction between national spaces and areas beyond national
jurisdiction, both as regards their causes and their effects.
The relevance of the distinction only lies in the fact that States
still are attached to the concept of national sovereignty and
therefore tend to conduct their diplomacy accordingly. As any
remedies against environmental damage must be decided and implemented
by States, and as most damaging events have their source on State
territory, the
<P>
delimitation between the latter and spaces beyond State jurisdiction
still matters.
<P>
Understanding environmental processes is a multi-disciplinary
affair which involves many scientific disciplines. Dealing with
prevention and remedy of degradation is essentially the business
of diplomats, national decision-makers and officials and international
institutions which mainly function as providers of data, monitors,
fora and advisers. Dealing with environmental issues therefore
can only make sense when following a holistic approach, which
means communication and mutual understanding of all involved.
<P>
Scientific understanding of environmental processes progresses
rapidly. This does not mean that predictions regarding the outcome
of such processes and their interaction are easy. Often more knowledge
only leads to the need for more research. But even fully understood
phenomena can produce diverse results depending on time and location.
The valuation of possible outcomes is obviously a subjective matter
which depends on the organ or even individual entrusted with it,
its priorities and its general outlook, and its regard for the
cautionary principle.
<P>
Although there is no comprehensive legal coverage of environmental
issues, there is a great number of more or less sectoral or even
specific regulations, some in the form of legal obligations undertaken
pursuant to a treaty, others adopted as resolutions and recommendations
of a persuasive nature. One reason for this situation is that
the urgency of dealing with such problems as climate change and
preservation of the ozone layer is such that immediate action
is required which cannot wait until the complex process of negotiating
global regulations can be completed.
<P>
The Colloquium noted with concern that whereas States are often
willing to negotiate and sign treaties, they do not always implement
them, both as regards legal and administrative action and providing
the necessary financial means. One can even note an accumulation
of regimes with similar or even overlapping aims none of which
results in much practical action being undertaken by those concerned.
<P>
As in the case of regulations there is equally a plethora of institutions
dealing with environmental matters both at national and international
levels. The
<P>
Colloquium noted that very often these institutions do not communicate
properly or even ignore each other deliberately. Very often lack
of communication and coordination at international level has its
source in the same lack of communication at national levels, as
a result of which different institutions get different signals
from the same countries.
<P>
In the Mediterranean region, the Barcelona Convention System constitutes
a framework of comprehensive cooperation between coastal States.
Whereas the Convention only concerns itself with the waters of
the Mediterranean, several Protocols are both more precise and
broader in territorial scope, concerning themselves with land-based
sources of pollution as well as with their impact on the sea.
Under the Barcelona Treaty system progress appears to have been
made in stressing the persuasive aspect of the law and the public
interest aspect of actions undertaken, wherein the concept of
public trust could be usefully employed. The Mediterranean Action
Plan has contributed a lot to help individual countries take the
required steps to implement their treaty obligations. This has
lately been facilitated by the availability of funds from the
World Bank and the European Development Bank.
<P>
The Colloquium was provided with detailed information on the initiatives
Malta has undertaken at the United Nations to promote strategies
concerned with global environmental protection. It supports the
proposal that a Group of eminent specialists, including scientists,
consider the requirements for the proper protection of the environment
beyond national jurisdiction and in areas under partial State
control and to propose possible strategies and institutional arrangements
to meet these requirements. The Colloquium also noted with interest
the proposal of Malta's Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of
Foreign Affairs to transform the role of the UN Trusteeship Council
into that of a Guardian of the &quot;Global Commons&quot; for
present and future generations. Although its realisation is likely
to raise many problems, this proposal should be further studied,
among other possible institutional arrangements.
<P>
The Colloquium discussed the specific characteristics of environmental
diplomacy and of the diplomats required for the purpose. It noted
the
<P>
importance of proper understanding of scientific issues and of
proper briefing by all national agencies concerned. It also noted
that environmental negotiations are difficult because overall
consensus must be achieved without prejudicing the clarity and
effectiveness of regulations adopted. A greater sense of solidarity
of mankind is required in this context, in order not to allow
strictly national interests to block discussions.
<P>
As regards strategies, the Colloquium identified the following
salient issues:
<P>
1. Identification of spaces, resources and activities under limited
national jurisdiction or beyond it.
<P>
2. Identification of environmental problems of such spaces, resources
and activities.
<P>
3. Assessment of the adequacy of the present international legal
agreements to deal with the environmental problems thus identified.
<P>
4. Formulation of proposals for legal and institutional arrangements
such as changing the mandate of the UN Trusteeship Council, elaboration
of new overall conventions etc.
<P>
The Colloquium also adopted the following conclusions:
<P>
1. The Colloquium supports the idea that environmental problems
of areas beyond national jurisdiction be examined within the United
Nations framework at a high level. It supports the proposal made
by Malta to appoint a Group of eminently competent persons for
this purpose and suggests the following:
<P>
a. The persons should be selected through the Executive Director
of UNEP and in consultation with the executive heads of all other
specialised institutions and agencies
<P>
concerned. They should be chosen on account of their high level
of expertise in the various relevant scientific and other areas
involved.
<P>
b. The Group should as a first step gather all relevant scientific
information from the various specialised institutions and agencies
able to provide this. For this purpose, it could establish sub-committees.
On the basis of the data thus accumulated, the Group should then
consider strategies and the legal and institutional framework
for their implementation.
<P>
c. Due regard should be paid to existing legal regimes and institutions
and the manner in which they might be used to implement the strategies
identified. Insofar as any need for additional UN structures may
be ascertained, the Maltese proposal that the Trusteeship Council
assume responsibility for the preservation of the &quot;Global
Commons&quot; for present and future generations should be given
due consideration.
<P>
2. The Colloquium considered the proposal made by the Deputy Prime
Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of Malta to enhance the
role of the UN General Assembly as regards the safeguarding of
the &quot;Global Commons&quot; for present and future generations
and his suggestion to entrust that task to the UN Trusteeship
Council. While aware of the serious difficulties involved in amending
the UN Charter, the Colloquium felt that the proposal merits further
consideration and it welcomed the suggestion that the Mediterranean
Academy of Diplomatic Studies be asked to prepare a detailed study
of it. <HR>

<H3>Regulations governing drugs and psychotropic substances</H3>

<P>
Legislation on drugs, which serves as a framework for policies
aimed at controlling the production, distribution and use of certain
natural and also synthetic substances, legally defined as &quot;drugs&quot;
and medically defined as &quot;psychotropic substances&quot;,
has gradually taken form during this century, partly due to a
number of international conventions.  These international conventions
(firstly on opium, then other drugs and, later, psychotropic substances)
aimed to restrict the trade in such products to solely medical
purposes.  They represent a trend moving from administrative control
to control through criminal law measures and from the prohibition
of the products to the &quot;indirect&quot; prohibition of their
use.
<P>
Without going into the details of international regulations, it
can be said that prohibition has been gradually configured around
three main axes:
<UL>
<LI><I>the prohibition of the production and distribution extraneous
to the qualities authorised for therapeutic purposes</I>, enshrined
little by little in the first international conventions (from
the Shanghai Conference on Opium in 1909 to the Single Convention
on Narcotic Drugs and the Convention on Psychotropic Substances,
both of 1971);
<LI><I>enforcement measures against trafficking</I>, enshrined
in the single Convention and firmly reinforced by the Vienna Convention
on illicit trafficking in drugs and psychotropic substances of
1988;
<LI>enforcement measures against purchase, possession and growing
for personal use, introduced by the Vienna Convention of 1988.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
National legislation has evolved in parallel to and sometimes
ahead of international law.  In Western countries, particularly
in Europe, the different national legislations form a relatively
coherent whole, which can be outlined as follows:
<UL>
<LI><I>enforcement measures against consumption</I>, either directly
or indirectly, through the punishment of possession, eased by
various forms of alternative treatment;
<LI>increasing enforcement efforts against trafficking;
<LI><I>extension of control through criminal law</I>, through
the definition of new offences.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
This means that prohibition of the production of natural base
substances is shaped by international conventions and the individual
legislation of the producer countries.  Prohibition of the transformation,
distribution and consumption of substances is conditioned by international
conventions (including European treaties) and the individual legislation
of both producer and consumer countries.
<H3>The application of international and national law</H3>

<P>
Paradoxically, despite the failures of enforcement policies aimed
at curbing production, trafficking and consumption, there was
an all-out offensive of enforcement measures in the 1980s.  Declarations
of war on drugs abounded.
<P>
Every war has its victims.  In this case, it is the farmer-producers,
small-time smugglers, user-suppliers and users, and in particular
the intravenous users of &quot;hard drugs&quot;, known as drug
addicts: in a nutshell, the weak links of the chain.  Other victims
have been certain principles of international and domestic law,
together with certain human rights which were trampled upon or,
in any case, not taken into account in this war, in which, increasingly,
any means serving the end of eliminating drugs is permissible.
<P>
Other documents will focus on the negative effects generated in
producer countries by limiting crop production to medical purposes,
eradication programmes and measures against trafficking.  To give
just a few examples, we could mention the development of a kind
of right of interference by the countries of the North (there
are the interventions by the United States in Latin America but
also the conditions sometimes attached to European development
aid policies), the militarisation of anti-production and -trafficking
measures, entailing a generalised restriction of freedoms (eg
in Colombia in the 1990s) and, more recently, the substitution
of heroine consumption for traditional opium consumption, giving
rise to eradication programmes in some Asian countries.
<P>
In Europe, and Western Europe in particular, measures to combat
trafficking have failed to curb this phenomenon, according to
national and also international police forces, which link the
increased number of confiscations to the increased flow of substances.
 The demands of this combat have produced three kinds of negative
or even harmful effects, however:
<P>
a) exceptions made to the general principles of law and human
rights violations arising from the introduction of national emergency
legislation;
<P>
b) the assertion of the need to punish consumers as a means of
persecuting traffickers;
<P>
c) the deterioration of health and socio-economic circumstances
of users, particularly addicts.
<P>
We can illustrate this with a few examples:
<P>
a) laws aimed at combatting drug trafficking seem to be evolving
towards an ever greater number of exceptions to the principles
of national legislation and violations of international and national
human rights norms.
<P>
For example, certain extensions of police powers (custody, night-time
house-searches, delivery surveillance etc) common to the legislation
of most European countries, introduce differential treatment between
drugs offenders and other offenders, violating the <I>principle
of equality before the law</I>;  the shift in the burden of proof,
provided for in the area of money laundering for example, limits
the <I>rights of the defence</I> and cancels the <I>presumption
of innocence</I>.  This constitutes a violation of three fundamental
principles of criminal law established by both national legislation
and human rights conventions.
<P>
b) national policies on drug use have alternated in the past between
an approach focusing on law enforcement and an approach with greater
emphasis on medical aspects.  Since the Vienna Convention, there
seems to have been a trend towards stronger law enforcement in
different countries: in Italy and Sweden, which introduced new
criminal legislation against drug users (later repealed in Italy);
in Spain, which introduced an administrative penalty for consumption
in public; and even in the Netherlands which, while maintaining
the most liberal policy of all European countries, are showing
less tolerance towards foreign drug users.
<P>
Only AIDS seems capable of reversing this trend, as it obliges
countries to develop policies of risk reduction.  Such policies
are operated in parallel with criminal measures against users
however, and in particular there seems to be an increasing divergence
between the users benefiting from substitution programmes and
those who do not, exacerbating the situation of the latter.  While
the Vienna Convention advocated the punishment of users as a means
of combating trafficking, the most recent European meetings have
revealed a consensus that punishment is a useful means of making
users seek treatment.  Thought should be given to the real reasons
for this attitude, as it contrasts so starkly with the consensus
established in medical circles that access to socio-therapeutic
programmes which are not freely decided is ineffective.
<P>
c) In all European countries, drug users are subject to criminal
proceedings and imprisonment, either for actual use or for minor
trafficking or other such offences.  In France, 66 to 76% of drugs
arrests between 1972 and 1994 concerned users and 13 to 24% user-suppliers.
 In Italy, in the first half of 1994, drug addicts accounted for
32.6% of the prison population.
<P>
The penal environment has a definite repressive impact on the
living conditions of these subjects, particularly those dependent
on heroine.  Furthermore, it hampers the monitoring of socio-therapeutic
projects.  Drug consumption develops above all in underprivileged
environments and when users encounter penal measures, they fall
into a downward spiral of increasing marginalisation and worsened
socio-economic circumstances, job prospects and health conditions.
 On this latter point, it must be stressed that the countries
which clamp down most firmly on users seem to be those which are
the last to introduce policies to prevent the risk of HIV contamination.
 The proportion of intravenous drug users among known HIV-positives
and AIDS sufferers and the high percentage of users contaminated
with HIV and AIDS are indicative of the perverse effects of strong
enforcement policies.  The high and known risks of overdose following
forced severances in prison are also worth underlining.
<P>
Nowhere, except perhaps in the Netherlands, are drug users considered
as citizens.  Being a community with reduced rights, often before
they begin consuming, they are crushed by repressive policies,
instead of receiving support through policies fostering their
access to fundamental rights.  Yet rights to the free development
of one's personality, social life, work, housing, freedom and
health are recognised both at national level (in certain constitutions
or domestic laws) and international level (Universal Declaration
of Human Rights of the United Nations, European Convention for
the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, European
Social Charter etc).
<H3>For an alternative policy</H3>

<P>
In both North and South, the drugs issue masks complex and often
serious situations.  Although the phenomena linked to it differ,
they all seem to be symptomatic of unsuitable social and economic
models and a lack of equality where the enjoyment of fundamental
rights by individuals and peoples are concerned.
<P>
An alternative policy ought therefore to take a global approach,
striking at the causes as well as the symptoms.  In which case,
it seems obvious that policies aimed at reducing unemployment,
cleaning up and integrating suburbs, general education and youth-oriented
policies would be far more effective than specific anti-drug policies.
<P>
However, these specific policies are <I>a priori</I> not without
their uses: the problem is to make them effective and ensure that
they respect the rights of those targeted.  Nevertheless a new
model is needed, and we must think in terms of alternative policies.
 A change of pattern in Western countries means a) attaching priority
to health, regarded as both a medical and social condition, and
b) considering drug users as citizens with full rights.  This
would engender a necessary diversification of policies geared
to the different substances, user populations and modes of use,
and a generalisation of risk reduction policies, extended to cover
the social and economic risks run by users.
<P>
It is not just a matter, therefore, of intensifying prevention
programmes to combat consumption as a health risk and providing
a range of socio-therapeutic support mechanisms but also of devising
policies to provide users with concrete assistance and support
for resolving problems in their everyday lives and finding their
place in society and working life.  Finally, it is necessary to
foster a positive image of users which, by replacing the negative
image of drug addicts, encourages firstly the users to think that
they can &quot;kick the habit&quot; and secondly the public not
to resist integration policies.
<P>
But these policies are not enough to ensure that the new model
will be effective, if the users are still forced underground,
partly by the need to supply their habit from illegal markets
and partly by the necessity of raising money for these extremely
expensive supplies through crime.
<P>
Various options are open to us, and they do not necessarily require
the legalisation of the products.  All the legal rules in force
are aimed at restricting the movement and consumption of drugs
and psychotropic substances to medical use.  If it is accepted
that the mental and physical health of drug-using citizens must
be protected and is as much under threat from the spells of detention
which are bound to befall an &quot;addict&quot; as the consumption
of substances in illegal circumstances, the provision of substances
within a medically-controlled circuit to users who cannot do without
them is compatible with the existing rules.
<P>
The examples set by Switzerland and England show that it is possible,
not only to develop substitution programmes (eg with methadone)
but also to dispense heroine which, if monitored for quality,
used with uncontaminated instruments and followed by more general
socio-therapeutic supervision, can help users gradually regain
their place in society (as demonstrated by the initial assessment
of the experimental heroine distribution programmes in Switzerland)
and, perhaps, even halt their consumption.
<P>
The reinsertion of users into a context of legality does not only
entail their reinstatement as persons recognised in law but would
also reduce risks to society; it is society, after all, which
suffers from offences related to the use of certain substances
and from the cost of law enforcement policies which, in many countries,
is considerably higher (and substantially linked to the punishment
of users) than the cost of prevention and care.
<P>
It may be assumed that the reduction of drug-related delinquency,
the redirecting of expenditure and also the gradual disappearance
of users from the context of illegality would change public opinion
in the long term and, consequently, generate more respect for
the rights of drug-using citizens.
<P>
Within such a policy framework, it would be a good idea to distribute
drugs and not just substitution products for two reasons: a) gaining
the loyalty of users, so that they do not return to the illegal
drugs market (it is known that users on methadone programmes often
continue to consume heroine on a more or less occasional basis)
and, consequently, b) gradually reducing the room available for
illegal drugs selling, making it less and less attractive for
trafficking networks.
<P>
Finally, it must not be forgotten to review the transgressions
perpetrated by anti-trafficking (and also anti-demand) policies
against the fundamental principles of criminal law.  Even if we
were obliged to admit (which is not the case) that the end justifies
the means, it must be pointed out that the value of such transgressions
is far from proven.  Nevertheless, they continue to spread into
new areas, calling into question one of the base institutions
of democracy, namely justice.
<H3>Paving the way for effective strategies</H3>

<P>
Current political conditions, both nationally and internationally,
suggest that the adoption of a new model will not be easy.  It
requires a change of mentalities and a change of tune, but also
more knowledge and less mystery as regards common ground.  This
seems to require working links between at least four sectors:
the NGOs on the ground (focusing on drugs, poverty, suburbs etc),
human rights NGOs (rarely dealing with drug-related problems),
academic circles and local administrations committed to alternative
policies within their catchment areas.
<P>
One of the obstacles to policy changes is the opportunistic use
of false truths in order to justify current policies and conceal
the real issues.  An effort to rationalise, pass on and possibly
expand upon existing verifiable knowledge is a prerequisite for
any action.  This knowledge exists but is fragmented at present.
 A comparison of alternative practices existing in various countries
at local and national level is also essential, to gauge the feasibility,
effectiveness and reproducibility required to form a basis for
a shift to other policy models.  We believe that grassroots operatives
and theoreticians must join forces in:
<P>
a) analysing the <I>real issues</I> of existing policies;
<P>
b) analysing and evaluating the <I>effects</I> of these policies;
<P>
c) devising and proposing <I>alternative</I> policies:
<P>
at institutional level, through lobbying
<P>
at public opinion level, by involving and enlisting the media
<P>
The first step is therefore to create a forum where these protagonists
can meet, work together and gradually extend their network, free
from institutional constraints.  This would pave the way for concerted
and co-ordinated activities and could provide a collecting point
for data gathered at grassroots level, which might supplement
information collected by institutional bodies and shed more light
on it.  This will give such a body the legitimacy it needs to
become a real partner for national and international decision-makers
and thus influence the framing of policies themselves.<HR>

<H3>Role of the United Nations</H3>

<P>
Since its creation in 1945, the UN (the United Nations Organisation),
has developed actions aimed at promoting the respect of human
rights in the world.  The negotiation of international treaties,
the approval of numerous political declarations and the recent
initiatives to avoid or stop wars and other armed conflicts which
are affecting world peace all bear witness to the enormous efforts
made by this international organisation throughout the world.
<P>
Furthermore, the UN has established an entire structure of agencies
and bodies responsible for human rights and other objectives contained
in the San Francisco Charter.  Among the six committees which
comprise it, there is one concerned with human rights and one
concerned with drugs.  In addition, organisations like UNESCO
(United Nations Organisation for Education, Science and Culture),
UNDP (United Nations Development Programme), WHO (World Health
Organisation) and HCR (Office of the United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees) have certain responsibilities for trying to solve
various specific types of problem facing humanity.
<P>
Nevertheless, in 1945, the UN also inherited a further task from
its predecessor, the League of Nations: control of the growing,
trafficking and consumption of illicit drugs.  For this purpose,
it has created the Commission on Narcotic Drugs, the Financial
Action Task Force on Money Laundering (GAFI), while the WHO takes
action in the fields of prevention and prohibition on the world
scale.
<P>
Thus, the UN drew up a list of 107 psychotropic substances (among
them the coca leaf, from which human industry extracts the alkaloid
of cocaine).  UNO also ratified three treaties of universal scope
(1961, 1971 and 1988) establishing a world legal structure for
the fight against drug trafficking.  Lastly, UNO has various mechanisms
which should now be evaluated from the standpoint of rationality
and effectiveness in relation to the principles which govern a
state under the rule of law and the international system of human
rights, at least as regards actual practice.
<P>
I refer here to the application of extradition, (in Bolivia, there
have been examples of simple kidnappings), surveillance of deliveries,
aerial spraying with herbicides of dubious quality, the detention
of consumers, the creation of many offences, special and emergency
laws and procedures (this was the case in Peru between 1978 and
1991, and is still the case in Bolivia with the unconstitutional
law 1008, and the Statute against drugs in Colombia).
<H3>Conflicts between human rights and the fight against drug
trafficking</H3>

<P>
The prisons are full, in both rich and poor countries, of not
yet sentenced and hence formally innocent people arrested for
drug-related offences (but, despite this, these prisons have become
supply centres for legal and illegal drugs).  A single example
suffices: in the United States in 1994, of the 82,127 prisoners
held for federal offences, 50,394 (or 59,4%) were in prison for
offences connected with drug trafficking or consumption.
<P>
However, the big drug barons who have colossal fortunes have several
alternatives when faced with prison: repentance, submission, collaboration
with the police.  Lastly, the very widespread corruption among
the police, the judiciary and the prisons constitutes a final
way - and frequently indeed the first - to obtain illegal release
and freedom.
<P>
Democracy in the countries in which drugs are produced or through
which they transit has been, and still is being, weakened.  The
military in my country are in political and military control -
under a state of emergency - of the majority of the producer regions
where some 200.000 hectares are under coca.  It is here that there
are the most serious cases of corruption and the management of
dirty money to permit drugs to be exported.  To combat this situation,
Fujimori's democratic government has decided that all drug trafficking
offences committed by the military should be judged by military
law and not by the judiciary.
<P>
Elsewhere, corruption and the infiltration of the money and influence
of traffickers' organisations have ended up corrupting various
civil authorities, at the highest levels, and affecting electoral
processes at all levels.  Mexico and Colombia are clear examples
of this.
<P>
Curiously enough, other processes at work in this &quot;global
village&quot; of ours are having a negative effect on anti-drug
efforts.  The globalisation of economic relations, the financial
stabilisation of certain countries of the South and the opening
of world markets constitute the three biggest successes of the
world economic community in recent years.  However, these successes
have brought about a situation in which the production of drugs
has become the only means of economic survival for millions of
small farmers on the Rif, in the mountains of Thailand and in
the Andes.  In this connection, we draw attention to the fundamental
contradictions between the policy of openness in the South, the
maintenance of strict protectionist measures in the OECD economies,
and the subordination to drug trafficking of broad social, economic
and financial sectors.
<P>
Subordination (others call it addiction) to the consumption of
drugs has not changed one iota.  The producers of coca and poppies
in the Andes are increasing at the same rate as the queues of
unemployed and redundant workers.  This situation is the consequence
of the structural adjustment programmes and reforms of the State,
notably in Peru and Bolivia.
<P>
On the other hand, the bands of traffickers find their illegal
trade facilitated by the opening of international markets, the
consolidation of trading blocs between drug producing countries
(Andean group), transit countries (MERCOSUR) and consumer countries
(NAFTA and the European Union), and by the increased flows of
goods and persons.  Lastly, young consumers find no answer to
the serious disintegration of the family, and seek escape in drugs
as their only response, despite the enormous amounts of money
involved.
<P>
The anti-drug actions frequently carried out in many countries
end up directly affecting the human rights situation in the countries
concerned: frequent arbitrary imprisonment, essentially of mere
consumers who are classified as traffickers; compulsory uprooting
of plants with no micro- or macro-economic alternative available;
indiscriminate spraying which has a serious impact on biodiversity
in Amazonia and on legal crops (Guaviare, in Colombia); violent
police raids as in Bolivia (Chapare, in the Cochabamba region).
 All this to be able to achieve the objectives set in agreement
with the United States and to go on receiving the &quot;collaboration&quot;
of this country and its support for any request for credits from
the IMF (International Monetary Fund) and the World Bank.
<P>
The theory according to which there is only one way to approach
the problem of the supply, trafficking and consumption of illegal
drugs - formal prohibition and rhetoric - has proved a resounding
failure over recent decades.
<P>
At the same time, such efforts have seriously affected democratic
processes in certain countries of the South, and have restricted
in them the possibilities for the effective enforcement of human
rights as recognised in the Charter of the United Nations itself
and in the Universal Conventions.
<P>
At the individual level, i.e. concerning civil and political rights,
various obstacles have arisen, such as the states of emergency
declared in regions where coca and poppies are cultivated (Huallaga,
Guaviare and Chapare valleys).
<P>
Second, there are problems resulting from the application of arbitrary
and unjust legislation, such as the special laws in Colombia and
Bolivia: carte blanche, trials which violate the basic principles
of the rule of law, and harsh if not arbitrary sentences such
as life imprisonment in Peru or the death penalty in Asian countries.
<P>
As regards the implementation of economic, social and cultural
rights, anti-drugs policies not only constitute an obstacle -
together with structural adjustment, stabilisation and financial
rehabilitation policies - but also work against the possibilities
for sustainable development as proposed by the international community
at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, and at the meeting
on Social Development in Copenhagen in 1994.
<P>
Collective rights are also weakened by the application of the
anti-drug actions, because the illegal drugs economy becomes a
way of escaping from poverty.  The results of these actions hit
the weakest links in the drug chain; the law is applied against
producers, and the economic losses shift towards the centres of
production and consumption.
<P>
For these reasons it is essential to redefine world objectives
and policies in such a way that the standpoint of the South is
given more weight than it has received in the past.  It is essential
not to dissociate the problem of drugs and trafficking from the
problems of poverty, North-South international trade in agricultural
products and the protection of the Andean and Amazonian environments.

<H3>Consequences of repressive anti-drug policies and relationship
between drugs and human rights</H3>

<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P>
The strengthening of the prohibition as a basis for approaches
and decisions in the battle against drugs is directly and indirectly
affecting human rights in those countries with illegal drug economies.
This situation is experienced differently at the three levels
of the drug economy: production, distribution and consumption
of narcotics.
<P>
At the production level the effects are closely related to the
presence of illegal crops, grown in a context of crisis-ridden
rural economies, of occupation of farm land belonging to the indian
communities, and generally in those areas of the farming sector
worst hit by the globalisation of the economy. Illegal crops have
become the primary alternative solution for defending the jobs
and incomes of peasant families, and the principal means of access
to goods and services such as health care and education, as well
as non-essential consumer items.
<P>
Government decisions to destroy the crops, and the producers'
response to such decisions are resulting in a tendency towards
the militarisation of the zones concerned, under the control of
armed guerillas, with little state presence. The result is a complex
conflict in which producers are caught up in a war, in the name
of the battle against drugs and subversive activities, that is
having unforeseen effects in terms of human rights and the violation
of international humanitarian law.
<P>
Furthermore, in its fight against drug trafficking, the Colombian
Government has decreed a series of measures under cover of the
State of Emergency, legislative measures that affect many aspects
of everyday life and make for a &quot;faceless&quot; justice system
that undermines legal guarantees and citizens' right to due process.
The state is also guilty of serious human rights violations that
it conceals by laying the blame on drug trafficking, thereby prolonging
its time-old impunity in such matters.
<P>
Finally, in connection with the consumption of illegal substances,
the Government is attempting, through legislative reform, to undo
the progress made by the Constitutional Court when it declared
certain provisions in the Narcotics Bill unconstitutional because
they denied rights to people who chose to consume drugs. The reform
would criminalise drug consumption again, which would only further
marginalise groups with problems of drug addiction.
<H3>Institutional policies and agreements at the national, regional
and international level and their impact in Colombia</H3>

<P>
While Colombia's anti-drug policy is based on prohibition, it
is strongly influenced by the pressure periodically brought to
bear by the Unites States. The imposition of a bilateral agenda
demanding anti-drug actions to keep Washington happy actually
results in a total lack of co-operation between the two countries,
with Washington trying to call the cards unilaterally.
<P>
This is a violation of Colombia's national sovereignty, preventing
it from handling the problem in its own way. It is apparent in
the lack of participation of civil society in decisions on drug
issues. The state has monopolised the decision-making process,
and any attempts at independent action have been in vain.
<P>
At the production level, overtures were made by the communities
concerned, but their offer to phase the crops out gradually were
ignored in favour of the total crop destruction policy imposed
by the United States, turning production areas virtually into
war zones. 
<P>
At the distribution level, Colombia has suggested subjecting dealers
to Colombian law, but this offer lacked credibility in the eyes
of Washington, and the threat that extradition or other means
of detaining and trying drug bosses in the United States will
be reintroduced is taken very seriously.
<P>
Finally, at the drug consumption level, a decision of the Constitutional
Court decriminalised possession of small doses of narcotics for
personal consumption, but Washington rejected this decision, leading
to pressure in Colombia to return to the old prohibitionist regime
under which consumption was considered as a criminal offence.
<P>
Colombia, therefore, has lost its sovereignty in the field of
anti-drug policy; decisions are taken on the basis of international
pressure, which is all the heavier today as the President's credibility
wanes in the light of his alleged dealings with the drug barons.
<P>
This state of affairs is affecting criminal law policy with regard
to traffickers, with legislation bowing to the whims of external
pressure for the sake of an international image in keeping with
the prohibitionist approach. It is also obstructing Alternative
Development policies, since repression prevails over consultation
with the communities concerned, and drug users' rights are violated
by exposing them to criminal prosecution.
<H3>Recommendations on alternative policies and actions</H3>

<P>
1. The Colombian Government must stop treating producers (peasants,
settlers, indians) as criminals. It must help them strengthen
their organisations, and make room for dialogue, so that environment-friendly
regional development solutions may be proposed and further violence
avoided.
<P>
2. The Colombian Government must not confuse the armed conflict
in the country with the drug problem. It must develop separate
policies on these two issues, while bearing in mind that certain
problems are common to both, and that dialogue and negotiations
should also be encouraged to produce a peaceful solution to the
internal conflict.
<P>
3. The U.S. Government must accept that there are socio-economic,
cultural and political problems in the production zones which
are incompatible with the pressure it is exerting on Colombia
to destroy all the illegal crops indiscriminately. Solutions must
be found to the basic problems facing populations in the production
areas, and to the environmental aspects of the question.
<P>
4. The international community must strengthen the Alternative
Development solutions and urge the Colombian Government to make
room for participation by the local communities through their
organisations, and to assume its responsibilities concerning the
protection of the environment.
<P>
5. The U.S. Government must respect Colombia's sovereignty and
stop interfering in its internal affairs by pressing for the militarisation
of the battle against drugs and for the reintroduction of extradition,
which will merely prolong the violence. The legal economy in Colombia
is already under threat from the certification system, and this
further jeopardises the chances of promoting viable alternatives
to illegal crop production.
<P>
6. The international community must strive to strengthen the Colombian
justice system in respect of fundamental rights, due process and
the elimination of all extra-judicial measures that constitute
a threat to human life or personal freedom.
<P>
7. The international community must encourage serious and impartial
analysis of the drug issue, in order to propose solutions other
than prohibition and the resulting repression among citizens caught
up in the drug problem in one way or another.
<P>
8. The Colombian Government must respect the decision of the Constitutional
Court concerning the decriminalisation of personal consumption,
and develop and strengthen its drug abuse prevention and treatment
policies.
<P>
Alternatives and proposals concerning the impact of the anti-drug
measures
<P>
The alternatives are directly related to social factors at each
level of the illegal economy. At the production level, more value
should be attached to the role of the local peasant and indian
communities, with machinery for consultation with the Government
in the context of a regional development dynamic.
<P>
At the distribution level, solutions may lie in legalisation and
in the country's own, sovereign criminal law system, developed
to cater for the nation's interests in a context of joint responsibility,
reciprocity and interdependence at the international level. A
special regime should consequently be developed for this type
of offence, based on respect for each country's internal decisions
and independently of other, unrelated issues on the international
agenda.
<P>
At the consumption level, what Colombia needs is the decriminalisation
of personal consumption, a liberal victory that would encourage
preventive measures and treatments based on individual self-determination,
and above all an alternative to the present atmosphere of criminality
and social stigma that merely exacerbates the social exclusion
of drug users.
<P>
All these proposals mean making provision for full participation
by the communities concerned, who have thus far been excluded
from the decision-making process, which has been monopolised by
the Government, under considerable pressure from external influences
and in particular from U.S. interference in Colombia's domestic
affairs.
<P>
Hence the need for international fora where the social aspects
of the drug issue can be discussed impartially, without interference
from political interests in the countries concerned. This would
help Colombia to improve its public image at home.
<P>
Furthermore, there is a serious lack of information in Colombia
concerning alternatives to prohibition currently being developed
and tested at the international level, and exchanges of experiences
at various levels, a lack of information that merely serves to
strengthen the position of those who deny the need for serious
reflection on the subject.<HR>

<H3>Contribution by Ricardo SOBER&Oacute;N GARRIDO - Peru</H3>

<H3>Role of the United Nations</H3>

<P>
Since its creation in 1945, the UN (the United Nations Organisation),
has developed actions aimed at promoting the respect of human
rights in the world.  The negotiation of international treaties,
the approval of numerous political declarations and the recent
initiatives to avoid or stop wars and other armed conflicts which
are affecting world peace all bear witness to the enormous efforts
made by this international organisation throughout the world.
<P>
Furthermore, the UN has established an entire structure of agencies
and bodies responsible for human rights and other objectives contained
in the San Francisco Charter.  Among the six committees which
comprise it, there is one concerned with human rights and one
concerned with drugs.  In addition, organisations like UNESCO
(United Nations Organisation for Education, Science and Culture),
UNDP (United Nations Development Programme), WHO (World Health
Organisation) and HCR (Office of the United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees) have certain responsibilities for trying to solve
various specific types of problem facing humanity.
<P>
Nevertheless, in 1945, the UN also inherited a further task from
its predecessor, the League of Nations: control of the growing,
trafficking and consumption of illicit drugs.  For this purpose,
it has created the Commission on Narcotic Drugs, the Financial
Action Task Force on Money Laundering (GAFI), while the WHO takes
action in the fields of prevention and prohibition on the world
scale.
<P>
Thus, the UN drew up a list of 107 psychotropic substances (among
them the coca leaf, from which human industry extracts the alkaloid
of cocaine).  UNO also ratified three treaties of universal scope
(1961, 1971 and 1988) establishing a world legal structure for
the fight against drug trafficking.  Lastly, UNO has various mechanisms
which should now be evaluated from the standpoint of rationality
and effectiveness in relation to the principles which govern a
state under the rule of law and the international system of human
rights, at least as regards actual practice.
<P>
I refer here to the application of extradition, (in Bolivia, there
have been examples of simple kidnappings), surveillance of deliveries,
aerial spraying with herbicides of dubious quality, the detention
of consumers, the creation of many offences, special and emergency
laws and procedures (this was the case in Peru between 1978 and
1991, and is still the case in Bolivia with the unconstitutional
law 1008, and the Statute against drugs in Colombia).
<H3>Conflicts between human rights and the fight against drug
trafficking</H3>

<P>
The prisons are full, in both rich and poor countries, of not
yet sentenced and hence formally innocent people arrested for
drug-related offences (but, despite this, these prisons have become
supply centres for legal and illegal drugs).  A single example
suffices: in the United States in 1994, of the 82,127 prisoners
held for federal offences, 50,394 (or 59,4%) were in prison for
offences connected with drug trafficking or consumption.
<P>
However, the big drug barons who have colossal fortunes have several
alternatives when faced with prison: repentance, submission, collaboration
with the police.  Lastly, the very widespread corruption among
the police, the judiciary and the prisons constitutes a final
way - and frequently indeed the first - to obtain illegal release
and freedom.
<P>
Democracy in the countries in which drugs are produced or through
which they transit has been, and still is being, weakened.  The
military in my country are in political and military control -
under a state of emergency - of the majority of the producer regions
where some 200.000 hectares are under coca.  It is here that there
are the most serious cases of corruption and the management of
dirty money to permit drugs to be exported.  To combat this situation,
Fujimori's democratic government has decided that all drug trafficking
offences committed by the military should be judged by military
law and not by the judiciary.
<P>
Elsewhere, corruption and the infiltration of the money and influence
of traffickers' organisations have ended up corrupting various
civil authorities, at the highest levels, and affecting electoral
processes at all levels.  Mexico and Colombia are clear examples
of this.
<P>
Curiously enough, other processes at work in this &quot;global
village&quot; of ours are having a negative effect on anti-drug
efforts.  The globalisation of economic relations, the financial
stabilisation of certain countries of the South and the opening
of world markets constitute the three biggest successes of the
world economic community in recent years.  However, these successes
have brought about a situation in which the production of drugs
has become the only means of economic survival for millions of
small farmers on the Rif, in the mountains of Thailand and in
the Andes.  In this connection, we draw attention to the fundamental
contradictions between the policy of openness in the South, the
maintenance of strict protectionist measures in the OECD economies,
and the subordination to drug trafficking of broad social, economic
and financial sectors.
<P>
Subordination (others call it addiction) to the consumption of
drugs has not changed one iota.  The producers of coca and poppies
in the Andes are increasing at the same rate as the queues of
unemployed and redundant workers.  This situation is the consequence
of the structural adjustment programmes and reforms of the State,
notably in Peru and Bolivia.
<P>
On the other hand, the bands of traffickers find their illegal
trade facilitated by the opening of international markets, the
consolidation of trading blocs between drug producing countries
(Andean group), transit countries (MERCOSUR) and consumer countries
(NAFTA and the European Union), and by the increased flows of
goods and persons.  Lastly, young consumers find no answer to
the serious disintegration of the family, and seek escape in drugs
as their only response, despite the enormous amounts of money
involved.
<P>
The anti-drug actions frequently carried out in many countries
end up directly affecting the human rights situation in the countries
concerned: frequent arbitrary imprisonment, essentially of mere
consumers who are classified as traffickers; compulsory uprooting
of plants with no micro- or macro-economic alternative available;
indiscriminate spraying which has a serious impact on biodiversity
in Amazonia and on legal crops (Guaviare, in Colombia); violent
police raids as in Bolivia (Chapare, in the Cochabamba region).
 All this to be able to achieve the objectives set in agreement
with the United States and to go on receiving the &quot;collaboration&quot;
of this country and its support for any request for credits from
the IMF (International Monetary Fund) and the World Bank.
<P>

rights, anti-drugs policies not only constitute an obstacle -
together with structural adjustment, stabilisation and financial
rehabilitation policies - but also work against the possibilities
for sustainable development as proposed by the international community

<H3>''From ancestral routes to informal trade on the streets''
</H3>

<H3>&quot;A delinquent is someone who pursues goals that society
values by means that it does not&quot;. R.K.Merton</H3>

<H3>&quot;Couriers&quot; and consumers</H3>

<P>
The last three decades in western urban centres have been characterised
by two constants: the impoverishment of working-class suburbs,
hit by ever-increasing unemployment, and the influx of immigrants
of various origins, today accounting for a large proportion of
the urban population. Since the late 1980s, the homelands of these
scattered populations from central and eastern Europe, the Middle
East or the Maghreb countries have seen a worsening of their troubles
and, especially, a growing autonomy vis-&agrave;-vis the major
powers.
<P>
Having lost their source of funds when the Cold War ended, local
conflicts are now financed from the informal economy. But the
quest for profits, especially where drugs are concerned, has pushed
the warring parties to extend their control of trade from production
to retail sale. Conflicts as distant as those in Kurdistan, Abkhazia
and Algeria therefore have, in this respect, a direct influence
on the streets of Germany, the Netherlands or France.
<P>
All these (often unwitting) messengers of disorder find, at the
end of their journey, another equally dislocated society, that
of deprived urban areas. Paradoxically, these stricken populations
from afar seem closer to that society than the consumer society
alongside it. Drugs therefore enable these &quot;couriers&quot;
to achieve the myth of success and they help those living in deprived
areas to tolerate their exclusion.
<H3>The &quot;short circuits&quot; of the Schengen area</H3>

<P>
So, alongside traditional trafficking by established criminal
organisations, there is now a fragmented drugs economy: in Europe,
Kosovo clans, Chechens or Moroccans; &quot;Afghan&quot; fundamentalists
and Turkish &quot;grey wolves&quot;; Nigerian &quot;students&quot;
and Senegalese immigrant workers; Croatian, Serbian or Bosnian
&quot;fighters&quot;; and Latin-American, Polish or Russian &quot;businessmen&quot;
form networks of dealers outside the traditional distribution
circuits. The party, the brotherhood, family friends, old army
friends or colleagues from information services tell them what
they need to know : the size of the city, local dealers, potential
customers. In most cases, they own the drugs they are selling.
They buy them in Albania, Bulgaria, Turkey, Spain, Egypt or the
Ukraine, and sometimes directly from central Asia. They consider
the whole of Europe a potential market, a target which sometimes
becomes a bone of contention. The fact is that where drugs are
sold, where they bring in the necessary cash, the distribution
channels are fought over. So PKK militants and &quot;grey wolves&quot;,
Danhnak Armenians and Lebanese, Kosovo or Turkish networks are
constantly renegotiating distribution territories, sometimes going
as far as armed battle, as we saw recently in Zurich, Frankfurt
and Berlin. These are not straightforward gangland killings but
military operations conducted by trained troops, brought in specially
for the job, who, after fierce fighting, will dislodge a distribution
network from a whole neighbourhood.
<P>
Others, who are permanently on the move and act as &quot;raiders&quot;,
do not disturb local dealers. Unless they are unlucky (as was
the case in Savoie and in Brittany in 1995), by the time the locals
and the police react to their presence, they are long gone.
<P>
These &quot;short circuits&quot; can be found all over Europe.
In the Netherlands they go from restaurant to restaurant with
false-bottomed cans of orange juice. In France, they tour the
bars, while in Germany it is the caf&eacute;s and saunas. Trains,
stations, gaming rooms and hotel lobbies all become points of
sale. Or, there are those that stay put in high-class hotels,
for example in Salonika, and work by phone, waiting to be contacted;
sometimes they even apply for legal status. They prefer the provinces.
After deprived urban areas, provincial towns, and more particularly
those sleepy, out-of-season tourist resorts such as Deauville,
Verona and Karlovy-Vary (spa towns, ski resorts, seaside resorts
and so on) are beginning to make a name for themselves alongside
Tirana, Sofia and Istanbul.
<H3>Poor man's laundering</H3>

<P>
The symbiosis between immigrants and victims of social exclusion
democratises, to a certain extent, the profits from informal trade,
permeating the neighbouring environment. While the drugs trade
continues, as always, to make a few big shots very rich, it is
also part of a micro-economy resulting from the profits from street
dealing. The negative consequences, particularly among young people,
are well-known: loss of family authority, appeal of easy money,
life in a criminal environment, contempt for knowledge and education,
often leading to unemployment, etc. But on the streets, in the
crisis-stricken family, the immediate effects of the redistribution
of profits from drugs trafficking are not to be under-estimated:
small shops and services reap the benefits. The financial pressure
on families and even on local authorities is relieved. At the
same time, traffickers exert pressure to ensure that the neighbourhood
presents a facade of legality in order to ward off checks: rents
are paid, petty crime stamped out and so on.
<P>
In fact, this redistribution of profits is simply laundering on
a small-scale, corresponding to the situation of the very poor.
It merely reproduces, in miserabilist form, a mechanism which
in other spheres reintroduces far larger profits into the formal
economy.
<H3>Globalisation and micro-economy</H3>

<P>
At both worldwide and local level, drugs today, beyond their more
traditional characteristics, have become a means of escaping from
recession or achieving desirable goals. They are part of a more
global informal trade which is a response to the failures and
marginalisation of some members of our western societies, and
to the confusion of the world in general. The immigrants and the
victims of social exclusion are both hunters and hunted in this
process.
<P>
Just as the gap is widening between words and action within our
inner cities and suburbs, so the psychological constraint of an
all-out war against drugs is increasingly met with a stereotyped
response. Such fixed attitudes stand in the way of any genuine,
global talks on drugs, for as long as we remain increasingly attached
to our national borders and our certainties.
<P>
Before proposing alternative policies, it would be better therefore
to begin with these observations. As simple as they may be, they
do not seem for the moment to be clearly perceived.
<H3>The visible and the invisible</H3>

<P>
This situation focuses our action and reactions around visible
facts. Racism and xenophobia use drugs as a tool and find convenient
solutions by replacing the word xenos with drugs. Once again drugs
become a pretext, a justification for other phobias. Street dealers
and &quot;short circuit&quot; operators tend to be people with
&quot;ethnic&quot; origins, working in horizontal structures where
profits are, always invisibly, both made and spent, whereas the
drugs barons, wholesale dealers and launderers are usually westerners.
Their identity is rarely known, although they are occasionally
unmasked: the most recent example was in January 1996 when several
tons of hashish were seized in Galicia, Spain, and the organisers
and kingpins turned out to be Dutch and Spanish businessmen.
<P>
In fact, the very structure of drugs trafficking tends to be a
joint venture. Its visible parts, fragile and connected to street
dealing, are ingredients of an illegal environment of both users
and dealers. Its invisible parts, like modern businesses, blend
into a legal environment and the formal economy. According to
the World Customs Organisation, the bigger the haul, the fewer
the number of arrests made. While the number of arrests on the
streets among both users and dealers is on the increase, arrests
for international trafficking are stagnant.
<P>
Despite opposing principles, according to which either supply
or demand is regarded as the crucial factor, they must be examined
together as interacting elements.
<H3>Proposals</H3>

<P>
Beyond the universally-approved action to revitalise and rehabilitate
the economic, social and cultural life of deprived urban areas,
it is necessary to examine more closely the nature, extent and
impact of the informal economy on these areas, in the following
ways:
<P>
explain, in order to find solutions, why street dealing attracts
&quot;ethnic&quot; populations and networks;
<P>
break up the rings through which operators exchange drugs;
<P>
guard against certain perverse effects of administrative decisions
which affect user habits and directly influence trafficking; for
example, the introduction of methadone programmes in France caused
an increase in crack use.<HR>

<H3>&quot;The micro-economics of drugs in the marginalised regions
of the Amazon in Colombia</H3>

<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P>
Contrary to all expectations, coca leaf production has risen significantly
over the last three years in Caquet&aacute;, an Amazonian region
in southern Colombia which stretches over some 90,000 square kilometres
and is the focus of this paper.
<P>
By the end of 1995, between 40 and 45,000 hectares of coca had
been planted in the region (this is at odds with the naive figure
quoted by the Colombian Government of 38,000 hectares for the
whole country). This makes it one of Colombia's leading coca regions.
<P>
On the micro-economic front, this paper will attempt to reply
to the following question: Are there viable alternatives to coca?
Are government operations effective and, if not, what steps need
to be taken? The relationship between poverty, coca and damage
to the environment is clear.
<P>
The Amazon region's coca growers have, as a rule, been expelled
from richer areas as they did not own any land and thus find themselves
in absolute poverty. What is more, this trend is on the rise,
with the population of Caquet&aacute; climbing by 12% in 1994.
<P>
The region's natural environment is vulnerable and there is scarcely
any government presence, which, in turn, means no regional planning,
credible production alternatives or basic transport, supply and
market infrastructure.
<P>
Coca, on the other hand, has not only adapted miraculously to
the Amazon soil and climate, but would currently appear to be
the only viable crop. Profitability and a weekly cash-flow, albeit
fluctuating, are by far its most attractive features. What is
more, in spite of the major risks inherent in the coca economy
- for one thing it is illegal, and for another, everything is
controlled by &quot;guerrilleros&quot; groups and drug traffickers
- the crop offers unparalleled logistics in terms of financing,
technical assistance, production facilities and markets.
<P>
In January 1996, the total production cost (guerilla fees included)
of one kilo of coca base in Caquet&aacute; was US$ 393 and it
could be sold for US$ 1100, providing a return of 250%.
<P>
Of the US$ 1100 it fetches, 65% goes to the producer, 20% to the
labourer and 15% on production costs. That means that a family
of four with an average of four to five hectares of land can make
US$ 690 a month per person from coca, which is much better than
the barely tapped alternatives. Cocoa, for example, provides a
monthly income of US$ 90 and rubber US$ 225. Colombia's current
minimum wage lies somewhere in the region of US$ 142. Although
coca prices fluctuate more, the crop can easily be stored while
producers await better days.
<P>
Yet coca has a social cost and is synonymous with illegality,
total state neglect, crime, loss of civic responsibility, violence,
family breakdown, prostitution and alcoholism. It also has certain
indirect economic costs stemming from the inflationary trend triggered
by over-consumption of goods that are not produced locally, thereby
forcing the whole population to take up the coca trade, whether
to be able to keep up with wage levels or to respond to the increase
in wages in the countryside or to buy basic goods imported from
other regions.
<P>
Clearly the coca economy has brought no benefit to the region.
A telling example is provided by the people of Remolinos del Cagu&aacute;n,
which boasts the region's most dynamic coca trade, who are poorer
now than they were 20 years ago when the illegal trade did not
exist. There is minimal provision of education, health care and
services and no community and civil organisation. What is more,
people live in a climate of fear for the region's future.
<P>
Many peasants are willing to forego coca profits provided they
can rewrite the script of the tragedy which they are currently
experiencing.
<H3>Current policies and trends</H3>

<P>
Forced eradication (military persecution and fumigation) coupled
with substitution programmes (the PLANTE national alternative
development plan, the PNR rehabilitation plan and the INCORA Agrarian
Reform Institute) are the only policies the Colombian Government
has managed to come up with, under pressure from the US administration.
But everything has remained at the stage of well-meaning intentions
with no effective implementation and the only results have been
a temporary fall-off in the intensity of the coca trade and its
shift to the darkest depths of the forest. The peasants have learned
by themselves to predict the behaviour of coca prices and increase
or reduce their crops accordingly. In the meantime, they have
refined agronomic techniques for growing coca and have boosted
output figures.
<P>
The government has no regional planning blueprint to reverse the
ongoing trend of the local economy. The measures it did sketch
out were paternalistic, inconsistent, weak and out of step with
reality.
<P>
Other productive sectors in the region apart from coca, whether
extensive livestock rearing or logging (activities that are extremely
harmful to the environment), are becoming less and less attractive.
Unemployment is on the rise because of the scarcity of suitable
wood, the drop in demand for cattle both locally and internationally
and the fact that people are scared off from investing in the
region for fear of kidnapping or extortion and a general lack
of safety.
<P>
At regional level, there are neither development plans nor sources
of funding. The &quot;regional government&quot; simply does not
exist and the local political classes work only on the basis of
patronage. Local governments are very weak and have no steering
body that can plan ahead; they thus map out short-term strategies
with no effective sustained policy to achieve credible regional
development. This being the case, coca still remains the only
means of survival.
<P>
The main government programme for replacing and eradicating coca
is called PLANTE, but parts of it are strikingly paternalist and
populist. What is more, it is not at all clear and enjoys neither
local backing nor local participation. The programme, which is
to run over three years (1995-7), is based on vague figures, and
is targeted more at forced uprooting than substitution. It is
actually divided into two phases: the &quot;stick&quot; (fumigation
and armed intervention) and the &quot;carrot&quot; (loans, technical
assistance and the market). Loans do not work because the body
which is responsible for them (the Caja Agraria) is hampered by
the many formalities blocking access to credit. Technical assistance
comes under the municipal technical assistance units (Umatas),
which are totally ineffective and bereft of alternatives, given
that the Amazon regions do not have a credible production system
and that the professionals are not up to standard as they are
appointed on the basis of political quotas.
<P>
The market is still the main bottleneck for all peasant economies.
There is no infrastructure or transport network in the forest.
A region of 90,000 km2 has only some 800 kilometres of roads,
which are in a pitiful state and located only in a livestock-rearing
area. Under the PLANTE programme, the market is planned over two
years, which is far too short a time-frame to stabilise production
and write off the cost of the infrastructure needed for such a
project. At the end of the day, PLANTE is nothing more than a
policy to generate figures, be they accurate or not, for the United
States Government, which naively insists that thousands of hectares
of coca be destroyed without suggesting any alternative.
<H3>Practical alternative policies</H3>

<P>
Setting in motion a development process is the only way to eliminate
coca and avert an ecological tragedy. Without coca, peasants would
be forced to destroy vast swathes of forest to make room for traditional
crops and grow enough to earn as much as they did with coca. Attempting
to eradicate coca by armed force in a region where the guerilla
reigns supreme is a sign of acute naivety.
<P>
A logical and effective substitution plan calls above all for
long-term planning. In this scenario, the first and most urgent
thing to be done is to plug the gap in terms of production, processing
and marketing techniques. With no processing industry, the Amazon
regions will never manage to export their products. Technical
staff must therefore be trained to oversee the planning, transfer
and management of production systems at different levels of production,
processing and marketing. Clearly, substantial financial resources
are vital for implementing such programmes, which can, on no account,
be scheduled over the short-term but only over long periods. If
such a scheme were not feasible, legalisation would seem the most
appropriate alternative, yet even if coca were legalised, the
process outlined above could not be put off indefinitely.
<H3>Recommendations</H3>

<P>
People are increasingly coming to speak as one on the need for
any effective illegal crop eradication strategy to be &quot;mainstreamed&quot;,
that is to say to cover all aspects of people's lives in Amazon
regions.
<P>
<I>Priority should therefore go to:</I> 
<P>
programmes to encourage a return to civic and ethical values;
<P>
encouraging the growth of community organisations by fostering
an economy based on solidarity and a sense of belonging to the
country and the whole of its judicial, economical and political
system;
<P>
identifying and introducing Amazon products which can generate
a reasonable level of liquid assets and profitability. This would
involve basic research and technology transfer operations;
<P>
expanding national and international markets for legal products.
This would include upgrading technical facilities, road links,
storage capacities and transport;
<P>
working towards the industrialisation and processing of Amazon
products, without which the enthusiasm of farmers for new crops
would be dampened;
<P>
providing social infrastructure (schools, bridges, hospitals,
water etc). Such amenities may help integrate people into civil
society and limit peasants' resistance to substitutes for coca
by making up for income lost from new alternative crops.
<P>
At international level, the technology required means that foreign
backing and investment as well as sufficient human resources are
needed to work out forms of production tailored to the Amazon
region, along with assistance from and training for national and
local professionals, who might take charge of arranging, establishing,
adapting and transferring such systems.
<P>
At national level, what is urgently needed is an integrated regional
development blueprint consonant with the socio-cultural and agro-ecological
features of the area.
<P>
At regional level, it is crucial to set up and strengthen government
and non-governmental bodies which are capable of bringing production
systems into line with the situation on the ground.
<P>
What are needed locally are integrated training schemes for the
transfer of technologies to suit the community.
<H3>Conclusion</H3>

<P>
Failing this, the likely scenario for the whole of the Amazon
region is another 20 to 25 years of the grim and tragic existence
that goes hand in hand with coca growing, with all its grave implications
for the region, the country and the world.

<H3>''Education, information and communication strategies in the
drugs sphere''</H3>

<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P>
Developments in the presentday world are moving inexorably towards
the internationalisation of the production, trading and distribution
of a growing number of consumer goods and services.  This fact,
the result of progress in the industrial, transport and communications
fields, has led to the exponential growth in the quantity and
variety of products available to a now worldwide consumer population.
<P>
The international expansion of production and trade obeys no rules
other than those of supply and demand.  This applies as much to
the production of foodstuffs, arms, cultural products, garments
and electronic equipment as to that of drugs.  So geographical
regions and populations completely unfamiliar with certain products
are now being attracted to these new markets, which are becoming
part of their consumption patterns.
<P>
Tribal warfare and local disputes in Africa, Asia and Latin America,
until recently conducted with axes, knives and ancient firearms,
are now efficiently resolved using Kalashnikovs, antipersonnel
mines and shells fired from long range.  In many remote corners
of the planet, illnesses to which traditional medicine and medicaments
were once applied are starting to be treated through modern pharmacy
and medicine.  It would take too long to list the changes under
way in everyday human life, but it would be enough to say that
not only consumer goods and services are affected, but also other
more profound and more complex manifestations of the human being,
such as religious beliefs and practices.
<P>
It is against this background of farreaching change and universalisation
of ways and customs that we have to consider the invasion of our
societies by drugs.  While the developed countries flood the planet
with their highperformance, efficient industrial products, the
disappearance of borders and reduction of distances bring us into
contact with often mysterious and exotic products from elsewhere,
used as perfect instruments for escape.
<P>
As these products are not part of its culture, the western world
lacks the knowhow applied to their use in their places of origin.
 Most of them being prohibited products, they are never marketed
with a &quot;dosage&quot; or &quot;instructions for use&quot;,
unless &quot;word of mouth&quot; gives some guidance rendered
more obscure by its clandestine nature.  A current trend accompanying
the growth in consumer goods is also linked to the appearance
of drugs in our daytoday lives.  Psychologists report sustained
and constant efforts to find a way of overcoming the pitfalls
of ordinary life.  Our contemporaries are less and less willing
to put up with the constraints of illness, pain, old age, distance,
loneliness and boredom.  They think they have found the solution
to every one of these problems, a response all the more effective
for being rapid, complete and absolute.  Psychotropic drugs are
at the fore in this context.
<P>
These developments have led to some concepts being superseded
by others more appropriate to the way in which the world is now
structured.  Citizens now tend to identify with consumer's participation
with consumption, and development with integration into the market.
 Communication, information and - very much so - the failings
of education have played a leading role in this conceptual change
and in these new social practices.
<H3>Current education, information and communication policies
</H3>

<P>
We shall first analyse these three fields, from the general to
the specific.
<P>
<I>Communication:</I> this encompasses every method of transmitting
a message and all the forms it can take: written, oral, audiovisual,
and so on.  It also covers the various approaches used, involving
advertising, teaching, entertainment, etc.  Communication about
drugs problems is part of this, so it is subject to the same rules
as those which govern communication about other aspect of life
in society.  Before turning our attention to communication in
relation to drugs and drug addiction, we shall describe the three
main features of communication in general at the moment: proliferation,
nonspecificity and lack of originality.
<P>
<I>Proliferation:</I> the numbers of messages for &quot;communication&quot;
are proliferating to an extraordinary extent.  This expansion
on every front leads to unstructured jumbles of information, resulting
in confused and garbled messages.  This just makes it more difficult
for an uninitiated audience to understand.  The introduction of
thematic channels might go some way to resolving this problem.
 However, it might well give rise to &quot;elitist&quot; communication
and leave the population groups in greatest need even more cut
off from information.
<P>
<I>Non-specificity:</I> one of the consequences of communication's
role in consumption is that the message is put across to the general
public.  This has at least two consequences.  One is that the
signal given does not go exclusively to its target, leading to
&quot;undesirable&quot; sideeffects.  The best example of this
is films showing violence or sex, which &quot;nonspecific&quot;
transmission makes available to children.  The second is that
the message, often tinged with &quot;consumerism&quot;, reaches
a broader audience than that with access to consumption.  Frustration
and marginalisation may ensue.
<P>
<I>Lack of originality:</I> there being no hierarchical structure
in modern communication, some of the messages deserving particular
treatment and methods lack originality.
<P>
The above three elements only make communication about such a
complex and new problem as that of drugs and drug addiction more
opaque.  Dangerous inefficacity is the inevitable result of the
disorderly and unstructured accumulation typical of this kind
of communication, coupled with a lack of clarity about targets
and a lack of originality in the message.
<P>
<I>Information:</I> this is more than communication, but a message
intended to be received by someone who thereby obtains a certain
amount of data.  This is already an area where there is more of
a target, and of which more direct use may be made for preventive
purposes.  It is nevertheless the case that information on the
subject of interest to us is extremely polarised and fragmentary.
 After studying the information about drugs provided by a good
number of Spanish media, a journalist called Milagro P&eacute;rez
Oliva, who works on the daily &quot;El Pa&iacute;s&quot;, states
that the information given by the media is processed in a way
which corrupts and distorts it.  This is said to happen in three
stages: simplification, homogenisation and generalisation.  The
end result after all three is an extremely inaccurate and tendentious
vision of the problem.  In P&eacute;rez Oliva's view, there are
two reasons for this: the fact that virtually all information
about drugs comes from police sources and the almost irreversible
tendency of &quot;information providers&quot; to regard drugs
issues as purely a matter of crimes or offences.  From this ensues
the advice that a &quot;media moratorium&quot; be adopted in this
field, enabling the conditions for fair and objective reporting
to be restored.
<P>
Noray and Parvex [addressing a seminar on drugs and the mass media
in Vitoria, Spain, in 1993] added a third factor to those mentioned
by P&eacute;rez Oliva.  These are the economic constraints and
requirements to which the media are subjected.  The simplification,
homogenisation and generalisation of drugs information, together
with the police sources and processing thereof, combine to give
a response which matches current trends in the information market
perfectly.  That market is subject to advertisers' dictates and
to the profitability constraints imposed by those in the media
who bear financial responsibility.  Apart from a simplified, not
to say simplistic, reading and a Manichaean treatment of events
with a view to high audience figures, large numbers of readers
and consequently profits from advertising, there is no hope for
information.  In the circumstances, there is no hope for information
intended to educate and raise awareness.
<P>
<I>Education:</I> this means not just informing, but putting information
across on a specific subject with a view to educating a selected
audience and giving it what it needs.  It always involves teaching
with a view to providing a public service.  Drugs and drug prevention
are problems which have been covered by large numbers of educational
efforts, from long-term health education campaigns to more specific
activities intended to prevent drug addiction.  With very few
exceptions, the main weapons so far used in such educational activities
have been fear, the moral aspect and health.  Fear and morality
created a real &quot;educational vacuum&quot;, preventing the
target audience (young people, atrisk groups, etc) from gaining
genuine knowledge of what is involved.  The drug situation was
shown to be independent of our own responsibility, like another
plague visited upon Egypt, bearing more resemblance to a divine
curse than to human behaviour.  This vision gave rise to <U>two
major failings in the educational effort</U>: on the one hand,
drugs seemed to be endowed with a life of their own, making them
unmanageable and quite out of human control; on the other, a stigma
was attached to drug addicts, as if they should be banished from
society.  The resulting impotence and discrimination merely make
the prevention of drug addiction even more difficult.  Good health
advocates abstinence, although it is known that people at risk,
who ought to be the main target of preventive action (weak persons,
drug addicts suffering from illnesses, etc) by definition have
little or no psychological capacity to resist.  If the health
argument were to have any degree of success, this would be vis&agrave;vis
individuals with little inclination to dependency, and certainly
not those who are susceptible.  It is a rather like taking coals
to Newcastle...
<H3>Alternative education policies and recommendations</H3>

<P>
Sensible education about the origins and history of drugs would
make the problem understandable in its historical context, consistent
with the development of our society.  Drugs and drug addiction
must finally be included as aspects of our real world and accepted
as a new part of our culture.  If they are no longer treated as
alien to our civilisation, the ills afflicting us become understandable.
 I shall now highlight a few of the practical ideas we hope to
contribute to the debate:
<UL>
<LI>efforts to dissociate from any ideology both health education
and drugs prevention.  It is a prerequisite that drugs be accepted
as part of our society.  Only by adopting this attitude can there
be ongoing preventive action, rather than temporary, oneoff activities;
<LI>elimination of the demon element so that drugs are treated
as inert and controllable, rather than as something with a life
of its own exempt from the general rules of society.  A prerequisite
is a demonstration and knowledge of every aspect.  This kind of
objective and scientific effort to spread the word should cover
themes such as original raw materials (synthetic or plantderived),
chemical formulae, means of action, pharmaceutical uses, beneficial
uses, risks and contraindications, the context in which they are
produced, manufactured and trafficked, and so on;
<LI>inclusion of such educational activities on official syllabuses
(primary and secondary schools, universities, military academies,
etc);
<LI>publicity for the views of (present or former) victims of
drugs, thereby restoring their citizenship and showing that the
problem is not just one which affects ''other people&quot;;
<LI>obtaining of funds, assistance and support from states and
international institutions for all educational activities (magazines,
films, publications, awareness campaigns, etc) in line with the
principles set out above.

<H3>Can the media take part in prevention?</H3>

<P>
The media are regularly the target of accusations by those dealing
with drug addicts: &quot;they only speak of the punitive aspects&quot;;
&quot;drug addicts are always shown as human wrecks&quot;; &quot;they
always aim for sensationalism&quot;, etc.  To that we should add:
&quot;What can be done so that the media can take part in prevention?&quot;.
<P>
Is this the right question?  Because the media can, to a certain
extent, put pressure on both the public and the authorities, should
they be seen as having to answer to the public, like an elected
representative or a government department.
<P>
The media have no vocation to look after public health or carry
out preventive measures.  Newspapers and magazines are seen, in
simplified terms, as companies doing business by selling news.
 As a result, their survival depends heavily on sales of advertising
space and maintaining a steady readership.  Certain magazines
have no aim other than to make a profit, deliberately focusing
on very specialised markets and exploiting the seedier aspects
of life (violence, sex, gossip, etc).
<P>
As for those famous press ethics, a media safety net, in every
country we have regular evidence that this hardly does anything
to prevent the media sliding into biased information, manipulation,
put-up jobs, etc.
<P>
Should we therefore give up any hope of conveying prevention messages
in the press?  No.  The modern media are formidable mouthpieces
but they are not - at least the mass media - the natural allies
of those who are involved in the field of drugs and drug addiction.
 At most, they are tools or go-betweens and the way to use them
optimally, with all their limitations, must be learnt.
<P>
Also there are media and media.  Television is a visual medium
and therefore ephemeral by nature, incurring considerable risks
but with a major potential for fascination.  Generally speaking,
the public have only limited confidence in it; the radio, the
immediate news medium par excellence, is able to deliver messages
to a very big audience; the press, more in the background, is
weighed down by the fact that it is printed, in our societies
where people swear by the written word.  But public confidence
in the press has been seriously eroded in recent years.
<P>
The media with the biggest audience - and therefore of greatest
interest if we are to convey prevention messages to the most people
- are often the least accessible for this type of exercise: the
bigger the audience, the vaguer and more slender the expectations
and the greater the risk of the audience growing tired of a prevention
campaign, rarely very entertaining, it has to be said, especially
in the case of drugs and drug addiction.
<P>
Furthermore, a prevention message, almost by definition, must
be repeated endlessly if it is to strike home.  Yet, short of
regularly buying pages of advertisements, it is out of the question
for the media to keep coming back to a given subject, however
interesting that subject might be.  News - this is a dogma of
journalism - is necessarily ephemeral and constantly changing.
<H3>Do the media manipulate information and messages?</H3>

<P>
We are all tempted to believe so.  Trick images, sound bites quoted
out of context and provocative articles are not rarities.  Yet,
deliberate malpractices aside, we are sometimes faced with a more
insidious situation: involuntary manipulation by the media.
<P>
Since they tend to meet the expectations of their readers in the
choice of subjects covered or in the way of presenting events,
the media may often be tempted to reproduce conventional or simplistic
rhetoric.  By adopting the prevailing arguments, and elaborating
on them, without detachment, they themselves help to form public
opinion, which then supports the prevailing arguments, which are
taken up again by the media, and so forth.  This leads to a kind
of media &quot;Larsen effect&quot;.
<P>
In turn, we may ask the question: do the media reflect public
opinion or do they help to create it?  Researchers have analysed
the way in which the subject of immigration was presented in 1993
in a daily newspaper published in south-western France.  They
discovered that it was frequently linked to other issues - petty
crime, violence, drugs and drug addiction.  Nothing overtly scandalous,
but an obsessive and regular correlation, working on public opinion
covertly. 
<P>
In an area as full of pitfalls as that of drugs and drug addiction,
this risk is permanent: whether consciously or not, an Algerian
selling cannabis with his uncles and brothers will tend to be
referred to as &quot;the head of an <U>Algerian</U> drug ring&quot;
(whereas a Frenchman in this situation would be referred to as
&quot;the head of a family drug ring&quot;).  Whether consciously
or not, drug addicts tend to be presented in terms of their failing
rather than as human beings worthy of respect, etc.
<P>
On the other hand, the media themselves may be manipulated.  The
fictitious mass graves of Timisoara in Romania or coverage of
the Gulf War are spectacular and disturbing examples.
<P>
This is a result, in particular, of the balancing act imposed
by working methods where urgency dominates but also of the choice
of information sources.  In the field of drugs (in France, in
any case), there are two main sources: the &quot;punitive&quot;
side, the police (along with customs and the courts); and the
&quot;treatment&quot; side, bodies dispensing health care.  For
the media the former source is often the more &quot;attractive&quot;:
it offers opportunities to witness spectacular operations (shadowing
suspects, arrests, seizures, etc) whereas health organisations
are shy of excessive publicity and prefer to work more discreetly.
<P>
It should, therefore, come as no surprise that certain media convey
a biased image of the phenomenon of drugs and drug addiction.
<H3>Is it possible to work with the media? </H3>

<P>
In France, the &quot;Grande Ecoute&quot; association has forged
working links with magazines and radio and television programmes
in order to have articles printed or to work jointly on regular
features.  They mainly work with magazines about the family or
problems facing society, by nature more open to prevention issues.
 Not only drugs are dealt with but wider-ranging issues, connected
with the search for well-being or difficulties facing young people:
How to be an adult.   Why do people commit suicide? etc.
<P>
The much maligned popular television channels do dare however,
albeit only from time to time, to undertake prevention operations.
 In France, for example, the yearly &quot;Sidathon&quot; (AIDS
Telethon) is now becoming a regular television event.
<P>
Apart, of course, from buying advertising space, it may therefore
be possible to work together with the media in the field of prevention.
 Generally speaking, success depends on having a good understanding
of how they work, what their interests are and what constraints
are put upon them.  First of all, they must be considered as partners
and not just recording studios, expected unquestioningly to pass
on the messages delivered to them. 
<H3>Some ideas:</H3>

<UL>
<LI><U>Learning to communicate with the media</U>: how to draft
a good press release, how to present our actions to turn them
into &quot;events&quot; attractive to journalists.  This does
not mean adapting chameleon-like to the demands of the press,
but bringing out the strong points of our activities, highlighting
them, clarifying presentation documents, using clear and direct
language, etc.  Far too often those involved in drug addiction
complain that &quot;the press did not turn up&quot;, even though
nothing had been done to attract it: no press kit, clumsy invitations,
a reluctance to communicate, etc.  As if, amid the mass of news
bombarding it every day, the &quot;press&quot; in question should
have guessed for itself the interest of a particular prevention
activity!
<LI><U>Training journalists</U>, regularly inviting them to seminars,
conferences or working groups. We must learn to see journalists
covering these subjects as &quot;drug/drug addiction&quot; workers
in their own right.
<LI><U>Setting up our own media</U>: very few media cover these
issues, yet the need for basic information is great.  It is interesting
to note that the most evangelistic groups, such as the Patriarch
Community, have their own magazines to publicise their ideas.
 The San Patrignano community, in Italy, publishes a superb monthly
colour magazine, produced to a fully professional standard.
</UL>

<H3>Magazines specialising in information about drugs</H3>

<P>
In 1990, we started up &quot;INTERDEPENDANCES&quot;, a news magazine
about drugs and drug addiction, in order to fill a yawning information
gap, make up for the lack of public awareness and instigate a
responsible debate in this area.  It is a <U>news</U> medium rather
than an <U>opinion</U> medium, because we feel this is what the
public needs most, in an area so full of partisan position-taking.
 The magazine offers balanced information, calling on the public
to accept its responsibilities vis-&agrave;-vis drugs: so that
everyone - as a parent, adolescent, citizen, drug-user, etc -
can have a better understanding of the risks for society and individuals,
going beyond simplistic views, so that they are better equipped
to tackle the issue.
<P>
Early on, the &quot;INTERDEPENDANCES&quot; magazine contemplated
the idea of taking on a European and international dimension.
In 1992, &quot;INTERDEPENDENCIAS&quot;, its Spanish cousin, saw
light of day, with the same basic aims.  In 1995 the first issue
of &quot;INTERDEPENDENZEN&quot;, the German-language version,
came out and three thematic issues of &quot;INTERDEPENDENCES&quot;
have been published in English since 1992.
<P>
Broadly speaking, we are set on showing that drug and drug-addiction
phenomena are complex: they must involve a number of professions
(health, justice, economics, police, education, research, finance,
etc) which must learn to work together in order to come up with
healthier approaches than mere punishment, which has easily shown
its limits, or simple liberalism, whose abuse would lead (if it
were tried out) to similar excesses.  They take a particular interest
in the alternatives to repressive policies being carried out in
Europe, as well as in the Third World or anywhere else.
<P>
For this phenomenon is not only complex, it is also global.  We
have detected several forms of interdependences, linking the individual
to society (the drug addict to anti-drug policies), the globe
to the neighbourhood (from production and trafficking to street-corner
deals).  No social category is safe, no country is exempt.  On
this final point, our various publications emphasise, in particular,
one aspect which tends to be forgotten, ie North-South relations.
 Drugs are a powerful reminder of the flaws in the world economy.

The need for up-to-date information on the political, economic

<H3><A NAME="theme3"></A>Contribution by Lucia BIANCO - Italy
</H3>

<H3>Introduction</H3>

<P>
In theory, at least, the connection should by now be established
between activities linked to the production of, and illicit trafficking
in, drugs and economic, political, social, cultural and ecological
environmental factors concerning the relationship between rich
and poor countries, between North and South.  But this has not
been translated into practical policy or other measures.  Only
a comprehensive approach to the problem of the production, trafficking,
use and abuse of drugs, which also takes into account the relationship
between North and South and global prospects for economic, social
and cultural development, can lead to positive results - whereas
the sectoral and almost exclusively punitive policies pursued
so far are only making the problem worse.
<P>
From this point of view, the dissemination of reliable, rapid
and constantly updated information on the subject is of the utmost
importance, so that increasingly global, integrated strategies
may be adopted for combatting illicit drugs at the following levels:

<UL>
<LI>policy-makers and officials;
<LI>technicians and specialists in the sector;
<LI>the grassroots.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
In order to achieve this aim, it is essential to tackle a number
of fundamental problems:
<P>
1. First of all, it must be acknowledged that scientific data,
relating to illicit drugs and traditional indicators of their
production, trafficking and use, are vital but not sufficient
for understanding all of the problems linked to drugs, both in
producer countries and in consumer countries - even though producer
countries are consuming more and consumer countries are producing
more, especially the synthetic drugs now invading international
markets.
<P>
2. Secondly, it must be established how, in the framework of media
strategies, it is possible to obtain a global and broad view of
the problem, that can bring out the inter-connection between the
production of illicit drugs, economic and social development policies
(in both producer and consumer countries), environment protection
policies, the cultural and anthropological aspects of the use
of such substances, the rights of minorities, the strategies of
criminal organisations and the mafia and, last but not least,
the machinery for laundering money earned through drug trafficking.
 For this purpose, the quantitative data available are highly
reductive and susceptible to manipulation, and must necessarily
be assessed along with qualitative data.  For example, when assessing
the ecological impact of coca cultivation in Andean countries,
it is not enough to consider only the area used to grow coca;
this quantifiable fact must also be put into perspective with
qualitative data: the regions where it is grown, the people growing
it, the means they use, etc.
<P>
3. It must also be established how accurate, correct and reliable
information may be obtained on goods illegally produced for illicit
markets and consumption, for example those drugs considered as
illegal by the 1988 United Nations Convention against Illicit
Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances; which information
sources may be considered reliable in this field: the governments
of producer countries, those of consumer countries, international
organisations (United Nations, WHO, UNESCO, etc), the police,
NGOs, specialised research and study centres, journalists, etc;
and who, and on the basis of which criteria, should select, monitor
and establish the reliability of those sources.
<P>
4. It must also be decided who may have access to this information
and how the information may be disseminated, not only among policy
makers or police forces but also among the grass roots who, in
this way, can be involved in monitoring the strategies implemented
by governments and international organisations to combat the misuse
of legal and illegal drugs - covering not only the stamping out
of narcotics trafficking, prevention and the social rehabilitation
of those involved but also development alternatives in producer
countries.
<P>
5. Finally, ways must be found of keeping open as many information
sources as possible while making them comparable, since data are
often collected in accordance with the aims of the organisations
doing the collecting and the analyses carried out are often founded
on preconceptions or partial data instead of being based on a
scientific research method.  The more approaches there are to
the problem, the broader the vision, the less the bias and the
smaller the risk of an ideological assessment of these phenomena.
<H3>Strategies implemented nationally and internationally</H3>

<P>
Although our list is by no means exhaustive, we shall be outlining
certain strategies and initiatives for the collection, comparison
and exchange of information used so far at various levels.  In
any case, it must first be stated that, despite the national European
and worldwide projects launched, the statistics available to date
have not been homogenous, have often been gathered according to
criteria which render comparison impossible, are often not scientifically
reliable and are difficult to come by.  In many cases, they have
proved limited, as they are essentially based on quantitative
rather than qualitative information.
<P>
At the same time, the data that are available concern, above all,
the phenomenon that we might define as &quot;the tip of the iceberg&quot;,
in other words the number of arrests and convictions for the production,
trafficking and sale of illicit drugs, the quantity of substances
confiscated by the police, not forgetting drug addicts being treated
by public or private bodies and statistics on deaths from drugs
overdoses.  On the other hand, when it comes to what might be
described as the &quot;submerged part of the iceberg&quot;, in
other words, the amount of land cultivated for the production
of illicit drugs, the economic dimensions of the market and trafficking
in narcotics and the overall scale of drug use, we only have estimates,
of varying reliability, or data which are often contradictory.
<P>
We often find a great lack of homogeneity between data from official
sources (governments, police forces, international organisations)
and data gathered by specialists in the sector, special centres,
NGOs and the grass roots.
<P>
In fact, there is virtually no pooling of or complementarity between
the various types of data which might help to build up a complete
picture of the phenomenon, ie:
<UL>
<LI>specific quantitative indicators relating to the &quot;tip
of the iceberg&quot;;
<LI>contextual or qualitative data: information on social, political,
economic, cultural and environmental variables conditioning developments
in the production, trafficking and use of illicit drugs in different
parts of the world;
<LI>data concerning localised operations conducted by the grass
roots and NGOs, facilitating a more qualitative approach based
on the actual experience and perceptions that local organisations,
&quot;producers&quot;, &quot;consumers&quot;, etc may have of
the problem.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
But, as mentioned before, experiments and attempts at liaison
or the comparison, continuous updating and dissemination of information
are being carried out at various levels.  An important example
is undoubtedly the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug
Addiction (EMCDDA), through the activation both of national networks
of special centres by &quot;focal points&quot; and of the European
REITOX network, which are due to be linked up with other international
bodies dealing with this subject: UNDCP, WHO, Pompidou Group,
CCC, EUROPOL and INTERPOL.  There are also other information exchange
systems dealing with the prevention of drug trafficking, such
as Teledrug, Dosis, Interpol, Europol and others, all accessible
to the police forces of the countries linked to them.
<P>
The United Nations, on the other hand, publishes yearly Human
Development Reports compares and contrasts social, political and
economic data as well as information on the respect of rights,
in order to determine the level of human development in various
countries in the world.
<P>
Among NGOs, in the North and South alike, several gather data,
focusing on their activities in the sector - the Northern and
Southern countries where they work - and there have been experiments
in their liaison aimed at a continuous exchange of data, nationally
or at European or international level, such as the European Committee
of Drugs and Development NGOs, the network of NGOs which took
part in the European Information Campaign &quot;Coca 95&quot;,
the Geopolitical Drugs Observatory, Acci&oacute;n Andina, NGO
Committees (including the NGOs recognised by the United Nations)
etc.  Alongside them, UNESCO, thanks to dissemination of the ISIS
data gathering programme, has offered an efficient instrument
for collecting and exchanging information: through it, information
exchange networks have already been established, mainly for exchanges
between NGOs.
<P>
Another reality which must be taken into account is that of the
information already available on INTERNET:
<UL>
<LI>a number of activists involved in the reform of drug policies
are linked up to information about their own organisations and
activities (the Cannabis Action Network, the Multidisciplinary
Association for Psychedelic Studies, The Drug Reform Co-ordination
Network, etc);
<LI>In the field of drugs policies, one of the most comprehensive
networks is the one run by the International Foundation for Drug
Policy and Human Rights, which contains information on the relevant
policies pursued by The Netherlands and those of other European
countries and the United States.  The United Nations support the
International Narcotics Control Board Web, in liaison with the
Commission on Narcotic Drugs, etc;
<LI>as for the use and abuse of drugs, networks have been set
up by official organisations such as the National Clearing House
for Alcohol and Drug Information, a section of the United States'
Department of Health and Human Services, and others set up by
NGOs or even anonymous persons, such as the WWW Drug Information
Server;
<LI>there are other information pages on risk limitation strategies,
such as the Habit Smart Agency and the Netherlands Drug Text Site.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
What all of these information systems have in common is that they
rely on sources that cannot be checked, since it is not clear
who rung the Internet services or who guarantees the reliability
of the data entered into them.  Most of the initiatives we have
listed offer no global and qualitative information on the production,
trafficking and use of illicit drugs and nor are they able to
set up connections between North and South.
<H3>Some ideas on alternative strategies and practices</H3>

<P>
Both locally and internationally, where there is an overdose of
information and sources distributing information, it is increasingly
difficult to find adequate information -by which we mean information
on the production of illicit drugs, although the same goes for
other fields - and strategies must be developed for liaison, and
the comparison, updating and dissemination of data, designed to
guide everyone, at various levels (local and national government,
international organisations, public and private social workers,
NGOs, grass roots associations), involved in the effort to find
responses to the problems linked to the production, distribution
and use of narcotic drugs, legal or illegal.
<P>
It is not easy to find global solutions to the problem - and it
would be extremely arrogant to think that we can - or out of the
blue to activate information resources that are coordinated and
founded on the same scientific bases or methods for data collection.
 Yet, it is possible to establish a procedure for the collection
and dissemination of information on the production of drugs making
proper use of and developing the existing information networks
and taking account of the following elements, vital for constructing
the methodology:
<UL>
<LI>a global approach to the phenomenon of the production, trafficking
and use of legal and illegal drugs, taking into account the political,
cultural, social, economic and ecological aspects of the problem;
<LI>a co-ordinated assessment of qualitative and quantitative
data on the phenomenon;
<LI>constant comparisons between governmental and nongovernmental
sources;
<LI>constant comparisons between North and South, between producer
countries and consumer countries;
<LI>the data and information collected must be operational; in
other words, they must be designed so that those using them can
determine coherent actions to deal with the gravity of the phenomenon
and assess their impact;
<LI>the scientific reliability of the collection of data;
<LI>accessibility to data.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
Undoubtedly, for this purpose we must bring into operation as
soon as possible the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and
Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) and develop it.  At European level and
internationally, this Centre could become an increasingly important
reference point for creating a culture, influencing opinion and
ensuring the reliability of data, and enabling everyone working
in North and South, governments, NGOs and international organisations
alike to coordinate their efforts.
<P>
However, on this score, it must be made clear that NGOs in North
and South working on the subjects of the production, marketing,
trafficking and use of drugs should be granted a fundamental role
at the EMCDDA.  Until now, their role and their possibility of
liaising with the Centre have been mainly left to local governments,
often guilty of partiality and not always willing to accept a
plurality of information or of assessment of data on the phenomenon,
since that might throw their own policies into crisis.  Such an
approach, often ideological rather than practical, makes it difficult
to find effective responses to the ever more serious problems
arising in these fields.  After all, by their very nature, NGOs
are able to collect information that could meet the criteria of
usability, globality and high quality which, as we have already
said, are vital for the construction of a network for disseminating
information on the subject.  At the same time, they are a mouthpiece
of the grassroots and the general public and, as such, may genuinely
represent those who experience the problems linked to the production,
use and trafficking of drugs, as well as those who want to play
an active part in the process of change.
<P>
We must also hope for the creation of an NGO committee in the
ECMDDA - representing both European and Southern or Eastern countries
- which could ensure liaison and oversee the assessment and dissemination
of information on the subject gathered in the North and South.
 Since the NGO community working in the sector represents a very
wide range of ideologies and since ideology influences their practical
activities, criteria for selecting NGOs for membership of this
committee must be established.  
<H3>Recommendations</H3>

<P>
By way of conclusion, in response to the questions analysed in
the previous paragraphs, we would like to make some recommendations
concerning the collection, continuous updating and dissemination
of information on the production of drugs.
<P>
1. A global approach must be adopted for dealing with the production,
trafficking and use of legal and illegal drugs, taking into account
the political, cultural, social, economic and ecological aspects
of the problem.  We feel it is important to emphasise that the
phenomenon of the use of substances defined as narcotics because
of the way they act on the individual (physically, psychologically,
in terms of relationships, etc) cannot be understood in all its
complexity if analysis is limited to illicit substances.
<P>
2. It is crucial to analyse together quantitative and qualitative
data on these phenomena in order to reduce the risk of bias and
manipulation and to make sure that they are useful for developing
appropriate intervention strategies.
<P>
3. It is crucial to effect constant comparisons between data from
governmental agencies (central and regional offices of national
governments, police forces, international organisations) and non-governmental
agencies between North and South, between producer countries and
consumer countries.  This can guarantee a genuine pluralism of
information sources and also make it possible to move from a multicultural
approach to another approach, transcultural or intercultural,
so that exchanges on these subject can transcend cultural, ideological
and ethnic barriers, etc.
<P>
4. Constant care must be taken to ensure that the data and information
collected are usable, in other words that they are such as to
enable those handling them to work out coherent measures for dealing
with the gravity of the phenomenon and assess the impact of strategies
already pursued to deal with the problem.
<P>
5. The scientific accuracy of data collection must be guaranteed,
in other words information or data may be integrated in an information
dissemination circuit only if the source, methodology, cultural
and ideological premises and goals for which the information was
collected are declared.
<P>
6. Data accessibility must be guaranteed, in other words politicians
(both government and opposition), civil servants, technicians,
those working in the public and private social services, NGOs
and the grass roots must be able to access the sources and monitor
the information.
<P>
7. The fundamental role played by grass roots NGOs, especially
local NGOs in the producer countries of the South, in the collection
and dissemination of information on this subject must be recognised
and encouraged.
<P>
8. The capacity of existing information networks must be increased
and fully used, and they should be brought into communication
with each other.
<P>
9. The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction
must be brought into action more quickly in order to create a
nerve and reference centre, amid the often chaotic plurality of
information sources on the subject of drugs.  The EMCDDA could
act, not only Europe-wide but also internationally, as a reference
centre increasingly creating a culture, influencing opinion, ensuring
the reliability of data and providing co-ordination between those
working in the North and the South, governments, NGOs and international
organisations.
<P>
10. It is fundamentally important to establish, through a committee
of NGOs working as a main partner of the ECMDDA, a system for
the communication and exchange of information between the European
Centre and non-governmental bodies and individuals in the North
and South which can be independent of national governments, so
as to avoid ideological bias and provide a link between the European
Union, local structures and ordinary citizens.

<H4><B>OPENING SESSION</B></H4>

<P>
<I>Paper of Professor David Attard: &quot;Environmental Protection
of Areas beyond national jurisdiction: Proposal for international
action&quot;</I>
<P>
<B>Chair</B>: Professor Kappeler
<P>
Professor Attard, in his capacity of convenor, expressed his thanks
to the participants and his conviction that this Colloquium would
help in drawing attention to the environment issues beyond national
jurisdiction.
<P>
Professor Attard then read his paper:<HR>

<H4><B>ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION OF AREAS BEYOND NATIONAL JURISDICTION:
A PROPOSAL FOR INTERNATIONAL ACTION</B></H4>
<HR>

<H5><B>Introduction</B></H5>

<P>
The urge to improve the human condition coupled with rapid population
growth and the remarkable technological developments risks upsetting
the global environmental balance upon which, to a greater or lesser
degree, all life depends. Unless timely action is taken, the generations
of the next century - just over 2,500 days away - may inherit
a planet wherein even the very existence of life will be threatened.
In the face of this grave danger, it is not difficult to understand
that environmental protection has become one of the main concerns
of the international community.
<P>
Whilst considerable international action has been taken, or is
under way, there is a major deficiency in this process which has
to be remedied if the battle against environmental degradation
is to succeed. It is useless to improve the environment in areas
falling under national jurisdiction if the so called &quot;commons&quot;,
or, more precisely, areas beyond national jurisdiction (hereafter
referred to as &quot;Extra-Territorial Spaces&quot;) remain inadequately
protected.
<P>
Efforts to protect the environment deal mainly with activities
occurring in areas within State jurisdiction. This is understandable,
particularly as: (i) until recently, a large number of environmentally
harmful activities occurred mainly within States' territories;
and (ii) affective enforcement jurisdiction has traditionally
belonged to States. The absence of an effective international
institutional authority has further encouraged this tendency.
<H5><B>The Problem</B></H5>

<P>
Increasingly, however, it is becoming evident that environmental
damage caused to Extra-Territorial Spaces is a common concern
not just of a State or group of States, but of mankind as a whole.
Activities which cause damage to these spaces may cause prejudice
either to States or the international community as a whole. Polluting
activities occurring in Extra-territorial Spaces could easily
affect areas falling under the national jurisdiction of a State
or States. Even when this occurrence does not take place, it is
still reasonable to argue that such activities may cause harm
which could adversely affect the interest of the international
community as a whole in the said spaces.
<P>
Consequently, improved environmental protection within national
boundaries may eventually prove to be inadequate unless Extra-Territorial
Spaces are subject to effective environmental control. Furthermore,
it is no longer reasonable to argue that any State or entity that
pollutes Extra-Territorial Spaces should not be held accountable
to the international community. The traditional freedom of access
to these spaces and their uses has too often been translated into
freedom to pollute.
<P>
Given the increasing demands of mankind and its rapidly developing
technologies, the areas of common use can no longer be considered
vast enough to accommodate all human uses and needs. The current
state of the High Seas, regulated by the freedom of the seas regime,
demonstrates that intensive shipping, large-scale dumping, greater
resource exploitation and insensitive onshore developments are
threatening to disrupt the delicate ecological balance of this
immense space which covers over 45% of the globe's surface.
<H5><B>Extra-territorial spaces</B></H5>

<P>
There is no general widespread agreement as to which areas can
be characterized as Extra-Territorial Spaces. The area known as
the High Seas, its superjacent air-space, and the international
sea-bed area, are generally considered to be Extra-Territorial
Spaces. More controversial has been the status of Antarctica,
certain parts of the atmosphere, celestial bodies and the geosynchronous
orbits. There are also problems with respect to establishing the
exact geographical extent of these spaces. The extent of the High
Seas, for example, depends largely upon the maritime claims of
coastal States.
<H5><B>International law</B></H5>

<P>
It would be folly if the international community, in its efforts
to develop an effective international environmental law, failed
to fully recognize that the legal regimes regulating mankind's
use of Extra-Territorial Spaces provide inadequate comprehensive
environmental protection. Despite the interdependence of these
Spaces, the said regimes do not reflect this relationship. Furthermore,
even the most evolved - that of the High Seas - is unsatisfactory.
The development of freedom of the High Seas was largely based
on the premise that man could not cause serious, irreparable environmental
damage due to the vastness of oceans in the face of the relatively
limited human uses thereof. The validity of this premise is today
no longer tenable.
<P>
The environmental balance of the High Seas is in danger of being
irreparably upset due to activities ranging from the continuous
disposal of radioactive wastes (adding to the existing radiation
caused by nuclear weapons testing) to oil pollution (some 1.5
million tons of oil are spilled annually). Even the 1982 Convention
on the Law of the Sea does not contain effective institutional
or legal measures to ensure the effective and comprehensive environmental
protection of the High Seas. In fact, the Convention sets up an
institutional framework which is largely concerned with the sea-bed,
ocean floor and subsoil thereof, beyond the limits of national
jurisdiction. Article 135 states that the legal status of the
superjacent waters and air space remain unaffected. Despite some
innovations found in the environmental provisions of the Convention,
the envisaged protection of the High Seas remains insufficient.
<P>
A similar, if not greater, inadequacy exists with respect to the
regulation of other Extra-Territorial Spaces. On the other hand,
it would not be reasonable to deny that some progress has been
made. Reference, for example, can be made to the series of IMO
Conventions, the Outer Space Treaties, the Antarctica Treaties,
the 1963 Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, the 1976 Environmental Modification
Convention, and the 1985 Ozone Layer Convention and its related
1987 Protocol. Neither should the conclusion of these treaties
be overestimated for they raise innumerable social, economic,
political and technical differences.
<P>
Furthermore, this process deals with the problem in a fragmentary
manner often producing haphazard, piecemeal and disconnected measures.
This approach contradicts the interdependence which exists between
Extra-Territorial Spaces. Any response of the international community
to protect these spaces in the interests of present and future
generations must take into account this intimate relationship
and must be global in scope.
<P>
Finally, in considering regimes to protect the environment of
Extra-Territorial Spaces it is particularly important to remember
that a delicate balance has to be struck &quot;between regulating
activities too late and regulating non-existent activities too
soon&quot;. Thus, for example, it does not seem unreasonable to
seek to regulate the use of nuclear materials in outer space,
and the disposal of
<P>
space debris in the region between 160 and 1760 kilometres above
Earth. Similarly, space industry's plans to establish a lunar
colony for 12 astronauts by 2005 to exploit lunar resources for
oxygen, energy and building materials may require more immediate
attention and possible amendments to the Outer Space Treaties.
On the other hand, action with respect to the proposed manned
flight to Mars by 2010 would seem, at least at this stage, premature.
<H5><B>Proposed action</B></H5>

<P>
The magnitude and complexity of the problem calls for immediate
action of a global scale. It is proposed that the United Nations
is the proper forum wherein such action can be planned.
<P>
In this respect, it is suggested that the UN Secretary-General
should be requested - as a first step - to establish (through
the Executive Director of UNEP) a Group of Eminent Persons to
prepare a study which would <I>inter alia</I> make recommendations
with respect to the identification and extent of Extra-Territorial
Spaces, the environmental state of such spaces, the rights and
duties of States and the international community therein, possible
strengthening of relevant existing instruments, and make proposals
on how the effective environmental protection of such spaces can
be best achieved. <HR>

<B>Course Objective</B><HR>

<P>
Developing countries, especially those with limited financial
and human resources, find it difficult to meaningfully participate
in today's intensive multilateral and bilateral diplomatic activities
which increasingly tackles issues that have great impact on national
interests and policies. Moreover, maintaining diplomatic network
is a big financial and organizational burden for most of the developing
states. The development of Information Technology makes diplomatic
activities less costly but more efficient.
<P>
<B>This Workshop is aimed at introducing use of Information Technology
in International Relations to small, developing and other states
with limited resources</B>. The Workshop will be a significant
contribution to the overall strengthening of the capacity of the
countries concerned in both conducting their external relations
and participating in a meaningful manner in subregional, regional
and worldwide diplomatic activities. Participants will acquire
both theoretical and practical knowledge on the use of Information
Technology in International Relations.
<P>
<B>Training Approach</B><HR>

<P>
The teaching method will be based on traditional and computer-based
approach. and will include lectures, seminars and computer simulation.
The Internet-module of the Workshop will be covered through conceptual
introduction as well as through practical activities such as:
on-line presentations, developing of home-pages, etc. Participants
will be introduced to the experience of other countries in their
efforts towards the computerisation of diplomatic activities.
Special attention will be paid to Malta's experience in the use
of Information Technology in international relations.
<P>
MEDITERRANEAN ACADEMY OF DIPLOMATIC STUDIES
<P>
The Mediterranean Academy of Diplomatic Studies was established
in 1990 as a joint undertaking between the University of Malta
and the Graduate Institute of International Studies of Geneva,
Switzerland. The Academy is an autonomous institution with its
own statute, established within the framework of the University
of Malta. It offers diplomats and officials from the Mediterranean
region a degree programme that leads to a Master in Diplomacy,
which is an internationally recognized university degree.
<P>
The Academy established in 1992 a Unit for Computer Applications
in Diplomacy. Its objective is to provide diplomats with conceptual
and technical skills for working in today's rapidly changing international
environment, that is increasingly influenced by information technology.
The Unit also assists Foreign Ministries in their computerisation
efforts.
<P>
The Unit have had the following major projects in last 3 years:
<OL>
<LI>Workshop on Computer Applications in Diplomacy (sponsored
by UN and Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Malta) 24-28 January
1994;
<LI>Database of International Legal Documents with texts of all
international legal agreements legally binding to Malta (June
1994);
<LI>Course in &quot;IT and Diplomacy&quot; for the students at
the Academy;
<LI>&quot;Internet Corner&quot; Project with main task to familiarize
students and staff members with new forms of communication through
Internet;
<LI>Computer-based Package for Learning Diplomacy
</OL>

<P>
THE COMMONWEALTH NETWORK OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY FOR DEVELOPMENT
<P>
The Commonwealth Network of Information Technology for Development
(COMNET-IT) is a Network Organisation aimed at fostering the building
and enhancing of networks of institutions (and networks of people)through
the mediation of computer networks. Its aims to promote informed
dialogue and communication between institutions to encourage and
empower individuals within them to become active participants
in the development process. It also acts to facilitate the sharing
of information about development related issues, existing skills
and expertise, and available products and services. COMNET-IT
uses a variety of means, including training, information databases
and various forms of human-computer communications, to enhance
linkages between sources and users of information and knowledge.
<P>
The Management Systems Unit, the Malta Government's Agent for
Reform, has been mandated with managing the International Secretariat
of this new Commonwealth Foundation.
<P>
THE MANAGEMENT AND TRAINING SERVICES DIVISION OF THE COMMONWEALTH
SECRETARIAT
<P>
The Management and Training Services Division (MTSD) of the Commonwealth
Secretariat came into existence in July 1993 when the Management
Development and the Fellowships and Training Programmes were amalgamated
as a result of reorganisation of the Secretariat. The MTSD has
a mandate to provide a lead role in Commonwealth activities in
the following areas:
<P>
Administration and managerial reform
<P>
Human resource development through skills enhancement
<P>
Supporting development of information and new technologies
<P>
Human resource development for post-apartheid South Africa.
<P>
The MTSD targets its training to the specific skills needs of
senior and mid-level officials, managers and technologists through
specalised group training programmes, work attachments or study
visits in multifarious sectors including management and administration,
entrepreneurship and business development, science and advanced
technologies and the environment, to name a few. Each year, some
4.000 persons, most of them middle-level managers, officials,
technologists or technicians, pursue courses both in the former
sector of training (certificate, diploma and masters degree courses)
and in the non-formal sector of training (workshops and seminars,
training attachments and study visits as well as academic exchanges)
on training awards for training in over 300 institutions. The
majority of the training programmes in the formal sector and supply-oriented,
being generally offered by relevant institutions for individual
and group awards, whilst nearly all those in the non-formal sector
category are demand-oriented.
<P>
MTSD's funding resources for assistance to member countries come
from the Commonwealth Fund for Technical Co-operation (CFTC),
which is the Commonwealth's sole multilateral agency for development.
The CFTC is a unique mechanism for development co-operation, set
apart from traditional aid agencies by being a system of mutual
assistance.
<P>
CFTC's resources, expertise and training facilities as well as
money, are contributed by both developed and developing countries,
the latter playing a dual role as donors and recipients. MTSD

some developing member countries have experience, expertise and
facilities to share with others who may not have the requisite
capabilities and facilities.

<TITLE>Barcelona Conference establishes a Euro-Mediterranean partnership</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>

<H1 ALIGN=center>Barcelona Conference establishes a Euro-Mediterranean partnership</H1>

<P>
A new chapter in the history of relations between the European
Union and the countries of the eastern and western Mediterranean
has been opened by a major ministerial conference in Barcelona.

<P>
After two days of intense discussion and negotiation in Barcelona,
the 15 Members of the Union, 11 Mediterranean nations and the
Palestinian Authority have launched a process of political and
economic cooperation with ambitious development and trade objectives.
In addition to the Palestinian Authority, the Med12 includes Algeria,
Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, the Palestinian
autonomous territories, Syria, Turkey, Cyprus and Malta. 
<P>
The conference achieved virtually all of its major objectives,
from targeting a free trade area between the 27 nations by 2010,
to new pledges of cooperation across a broad range of political,
social and economic fields. 
<P>
One of the most remarkable features of the conference was the
new-found spirit of cooperation between former enemies in the
Mediterranean group. They endorsed a Declaration pledging to promote
peace and stability in their region, to respect the right to self-determination,
to settle their disputes by peaceful means and to strengthen their
cooperation in preventing and combating terrorism. 
<P>
&quot;This represents the culmination of ancient aspirations and
the start of a new relationship. With perseverance, vision and
the will to overcome, we shall achieve our objectives,&quot; said
Felipe Gonzalez, Spanish prime minister and President of the European
Union's Council of Ministers. 
<P>
The Declaration comprises four chapters and an annex setting out
priorities for a work programme. 
<OL>
<LI><A HREF="#a">Political and Security Partnership </A>
<LI><A HREF="#b">Economic and Financial Partnership </A>
<LI><A HREF="#c">Partnership in Social, Cultural and Human Affairs. </A>
<LI><A HREF="#d">Follow-Up </A>
<LI><A HREF="#e">Work Programme </A>
</OL>
<HR>
<A NAME="a"><H3 ALIGN=center>Political and Security Partnership</H3> </A>
<P>
The participants stressed their conviction that the peace, stability
and security of the Mediterranean region are common assets which
they pledged to promote and strengthen &quot;by all means at their
disposal.&quot; In this spirit they declared the following principles:

<UL>
<LI>respect for human rights and fundamental liberties - including
the freedoms of expression, thought and of association; 
<LI>the equal rights of peoples and the right to self-determination;

<LI>non-interference in the internal affairs of other partners;

<LI>settlement of disputes by peaceful means; 
<LI>stronger cooperation in the fight against terrorism; 
<LI>enhance regional security by working, among other things,
for the non-proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological
weapons through adherence to, and compliance with, international
agreements; 
<LI>a Middle East free of weapons of destruction - nuclear, chemical
and biological as well as their delivery systems. 
</UL>

<P>
The Declaration addsthat the signatories will take practical
steps to prevent arms proliferation. They will also avoid developing
a military capacity greater than their legitimate defence needs.
<HR>
<A NAME="b"><H3 ALIGN=center>Economic and Financial Partnership</H3></A>
<P>
For the Mediterranean region, participating countries fixed three
long term objectives for their partnership: 
<OL>
<LI>to speed up the pace of lasting social and economic development;

<LI>to improve peoples' living conditions: by raising employment
and closing the development gap in the Euro-Mediterranean region;

<LI>to promote cooperation and regional integration 
</OL>

<P>
The main vehicle for progress in these directions will be the
gradual establishment of a free trade area between the EU and
the Med12 by 2010. This will involve the progressive elimination
of tariff and non-tariff barriers on manufactured products and
a progressive liberalisation of trade in farm products and in
services. 
<P>
The Declaration also refers to a &quot;substantial increase&quot;
in the financial assistance to be provided by the EU and its partners.
Last June, the European Council in Cannes agreed that ECU4,685
billion should be provided from the EU budget between 1995 and
1999. In addition, European Investment Bank loans will be available
to the Med12 together with bilateral assistance from the Member
States of the Union. 
<P>
The Barcelona conference agreed that a key factor in developing
free trade will be cooperation and the growth of trade between
the Med12 themselves. Participants decided that they would encourage
companies to make cross-border agreements and to give a high priority
to improving and protecting the environment. They will also to
decided to increase cooperation in the energy field and in modernising
and restructuring agriculture.<HR>
<A NAME="c"><H3 ALIGN=center>Partnership in Social, Cultural and Human Affairs</H3></A>
<P>
Recognising that mutual understanding can be greatly enhanced
by human exchanges and a dialogue between cultures , the conference
agreed to establish a wide range of cooperation between their
peoples, not only in the world of politics but also in culture,
religion, education, the media, as well as between trade unions
and public and private companies. 
<P>
The Declaration also recognises the challenges posed by current
population trends in the Med12 and says they must be counterbalanced
by &quot;appropriate policies to accelerate economic take-off&quot;.
Participants agreed to strengthen their cooperation to reduce
migratory pressures and illegal immigration. They also acknowledged
the principal that source countries had &quot;a responsibility
for readmission&quot; of illegal immigrants to Europe.<HR>
<A NAME="d"><H3 ALIGN=center>Follow-Up</H3></A>
<P>
Foreign Ministers from the 27 nations will meet periodically to
review progress in implementing the Barcelona Declaration and
to agree on actions which will achieve its objectives. Their first
meeting will be in the first half of 1997 in a Mediterranean Member
State of the Union. 
<P>
Various sectoral meetings at ministerial level will be organised
together with ad hoc conferences. 
<P>
The first gathering of Ministers will be those responsible for
Industry and Energy in Italy during the first half of 1996; the
second a conference of Ministers of the Environment and also,
possibly, Agriculture, in the second half of 1996 in Ireland.

<P>
At the end of 1996, a special conference of ministers and leaders
from business and finance will be organised in London to discuss
how to boost private sector investment in the Med12. Britain and
the European Commission will prepare a joint study on the problem
for the conference. 
<P>
The overall tasks of coordination, management of the work programme
and preparation of the next Conference of Foreign Ministers will
be handled by senior officials on a &quot;Euro-Mediterranean Committee
for the Barcelona Process.&quot; 
<P>
For its part, the European Commission will take charge of preparing
and following up on meetings connected with the work programme
and with the conclusions of the Process Committee.<HR>
<A NAME="e"><H3 ALIGN=center>Work Programme</H3></A>
<P>
The purpose of this programme is to translate the Barcelona Declaration
into concrete actions. Initially, it consists of: 
<P><UL>
<LI><I>The Political and Security Partnership</I> 
<P>
Senior officials will meet in the first quarter of 1996 to begin
work on an action plan. Foreign policy institutes will be encouraged
to create a cooperation network 
<P>
<I><LI>The Economic and Financial Partnership </I>
<P>
Periodic meetings at the levels of ministers, officials and experts
to establish cooperation in many areas including: 
<UL>
<LI>developing the free trade area; 
<LI>creating the right climate for investment; 
<LI>encouraging European private sector involvement in industrial

<LI>development;

by such means as 
<LI>sponsored performances and coproductions; 
<LI>encouraging greater interaction between the media of the EU15
and the 
<LI>Med12; 
<LI>health care training and management;

External Relations, Council of Europe, Strasbourg</FONT>
<HR>

<P>
First of all, allow me to say a few words about the Council of
Europe. It is the oldest European institution, created in 1949
with the aim to &quot;achieve a greater unity between its Members
for the purpose of safeguarding and realising the ideals and principles
which are their common heritage and facilitating their economic
and social progress&quot; (art. 1a of the Statute of the Council
of Europe).<BR>

<P>
To become a member of the Council a country must accept the principles
of the rule of law and the protection of human rights and meet
the requirements of genuine pluralistic parliamentary democracy.
Within the Council of Europe the respect of the rights of minorities
has also become an important aspect of human rights protection.
<BR>

<P>
Since the accession of Russia on 28 February 1996, our Organisation
counts 39 member States. It is expected that in the coming years
the Council will group all the European countries, thus becoming
a truly pan-European organisation. Moreover, in December 1995
the United States obtained observer status with the Council of
Europe, and Canada and Japan have applied for similar status.
<BR>

<P>
Co-operation in the Mediterranean has been a long-standing feature
of the Council of Europe's activities. However, this co-operation
has until now benefited mainly the Mediterranean member States.
We would have to go a long time back in history to trace the beginning
of our activities on behalf of the Mediterranean countries. Let
me cite, as an example, the creation in 1962 - on the initiative
of the Council of Europe and the OECD - of the International Centre
for Advanced Mediterranean Agronomic Studies, the main purpose
of which is to provide complementary training of technical and
scientific staff in agriculture and development.<BR>

<P>
As far as the Parliamentary Assembly is concerned, it has focused
much attention on environmental issues, proposing several actions
designed to combat the deteriorating environmental situation.
This has led, among other things to the 1975 Treaty of Barcelona
on the protection of the Mediterranean sea, a UN initiative signed
by almost all Mediterranean member States of the Council of Europe,
to an information campaign of the &quot;Centre for documentation
and information on the Environment and Nature&quot; between 1988
and 1991, and to the launching in 1991 of the &quot;Blue Europe&quot;
programme on the elaboration of a pan-European policy on the management
of water resources. <BR>

<P>
The Parliamentary Assembly has organised four major Mediterranean
conferences in Co-operation with the Congress of Local and Regional
Authorities of Europe. The first such Conference was held in Marseille
in 1985 and adopted the Declaration of Marseille, focusing on
the elaboration of several proposals for the resolution of the
environmental problems and the institutionalisation of the dialogue
between the two shores of the Mediterranean. The second, held
in Malaga in 1987, led to a final declaration covering the questions
of tourism, transport and communication in the Mediterranean basin,
and the means to reinforcing interregional co-operation. In 1993
the third Conference of Mediterranean regions was held in Taormina
and the main subjects dealt with were the promotion of dialogue
between the two Mediterranean shores, co-operation in the field
of democracy and human rights in order to guarantee the &quot;Democratic
security in the Mediterranean&quot;, as well as in the field of
environment and immigration. Finally, the fourth Conference was
held in Cyprus in 1995 and focused on the &quot;sustainable development
in the Mediterranean Basin: environment, demography and migrations&quot;,
underlining for the member states of the Council of Europe, the
importance of including North-South co-operation in their Mediterranean
policy and, by means of regional and local authorities and NGOs,
promoting intercultural dialogue, tolerance and the integration
of immigrants in their societies. The fifth Conference is planned
to be held in Languedoc-Roussillon, in 1997.<BR>

<P>
A Parliamentary hearing on co-operation in the Mediterranean is
scheduled to be held in Thessaloniki on 27 May 1996.<BR>

<P>
On the Intergovernmental side, the Council of Europe and the Greek
Ministry of Regional Planning are organising a Seminar in Athens
on 25 and 27 April 1996 on the subject of &quot;The Challenges
facing European Society with the Approach of the Year 2000: Strategies
for the sustainable development of European States in the Mediterranean
Basin&quot; in preparation for the Conference of European ministers
responsible for regional planning, to be held in Cyprus in 1997.
<BR>

<P>
The Council of Europe has also paid much attention to political,
economic and immigration issues in the Mediterranean. <BR>

<P>
One major point of concern has been the conflict over Cyprus.
Whereas a solution to this problem must be found under the a egis
of the Secretary General of the United Nations, the Council of
Europe has closely followed the situation, devoted much energy
and time to efforts of reconciliation and to making constructive
proposals for a solution [cf. Recommendation 1259 (1995) and Resolution
1054 (1995) of Parliamentary Assembly on the situation in Cyprus
-recent political developments]. The Assembly's Rapporteur, Lord
Finsberg, very recently visited Cyprus in preparation of new proposals,
in support of the UN's Secretary General's proposals on a bi-communal
structure, to be presented to the Parliamentary Assembly in June
1996.<BR>

<P>
The second major problem is the instability in the Middle-East
over the Palestinian question. The Assembly has made great efforts
to promote the peace process through visits and goodwill missions
and by fostering contacts between the Israelis and the Palestinians.
This led in 1993 to the adoption of the Recommendation 1221 and
the Resolution 1013 on the Peace Process in the Middle-East.<BR>

<P>
As a result of this initiative, both Mr Yitzhak Rabin and Mr Yasser
Arafat addressed our Assembly on 26 January and 13 April 1994
respectively. More recently, the Assembly has set up five Task
Forces on economic reconstruction and development, youth and education,
local democracy, democratic institution-building, and human rights,
the judiciary and the penitentiary in the Middle -East in order
to prepare a major assembly debate on the peace process next June.
In the meantime, three Task Forces have held their first meetings
with the participation of Israeli, Palestinian and European delegations.
<BR>

<P>
The third major challenge to Europe consists in creating better
co-operation with the countries of the Southern Mediterranean.
In this connection I would like to draw your attention to the
Assembly's work in favour of a better intercultural and interreligious
understanding, which led to the adoption of Resolution 885 (1991)
and 1202 (1993). 
<P>
In Vienna, at the summit meeting of Heads of State and Governments
of the Council of Europe member States, it was declared that &quot;the
deepening of Co-operation in order to take account of the new
European situation should in no way divert us from our responsibilities
regarding North-South interdependence and stability&quot;. In
this spirit, Europe has a responsibility towards the countries
of the Southern littoral, which are not eligible to join the Council
of Europe or the European Union. The Committee of Ministers is
fully aware both that the future of these nearby countries has
a vital bearing on Europe's democratic security and stability
and that it is essential to promote their political, economic,
social and cultural development, in order to contribute to a greater
respect for human rights. For these reasons, the Committee of
Ministers decided, among other things, to set up a working party
of Ambassadors in order to follow up the Parliamentary Assembly's
Recommendation 1249 (1994) on &quot;Co-operation in the Mediterranean
basin&quot;. This group, which is chaired by Dr. Buttigieg Scicluna,
the Ambassador of Malta, has identified a number of areas where
the development of the Council of Europe's relations with the
Mediterranean countries seem potentially useful. The main areas
are: the establishment of democratic institutions, the promotion
of the rule of law and human rights, including minority rights
and equality between women and men, emigration, the fight against
drug-trafficking and drug-use, action against racism and intolerance,
as well as the environment and the common cultural heritage.<BR>

<P>
This contribution also identified a number of Council of Europe
conventions and partial agreements open to accession by non-member
countries and likely to be of interest for the purposes of Mediterranean
co-operation. These concern culture, the environment and wildlife,
and the legal field. Moreover it was proposed that Mediterranean
non-member States could benefit from the accession to two partial
agreements of the Council of Europe, that is to say the &quot;Open
Partial Agreement on the prevention of, protection against, and
organisation of relief in, major natural and technological disasters&quot;
and the one on &quot;the European Centre for Global Interdependence
and Solidarity&quot; or more poignantly referred to as &quot;the
North-South Centre&quot; of the Council of Europe.<BR>

<P>
This Centre could indeed become one of the focal points for Mediterranean
co-operation. For this purpose, the Centre has already set up
a Transmed Programme which includes a youth programme, co-operation
between the media, the setting up of an information system on
Internet for the Mediterranean called Medgate, confidence-building
measures in the Middle-East, cultural exchanges, and co-operation
with organisations of local and regional authorities. In fact,
the initiative for the Transmed activities was taken at the &quot;international
Symosium on Trans-Mediterranean Interdependence and Partnership&quot;,
organised by the North-South Centre in Rome in 1994.<BR>

<P>
For the future I can see three major lines of action. <BR>

<P>
Firstly, the Parliamentary Assembly will continue to play an essential
role in promoting co-operation and political dialogue in the Mediterranean
area. This concerns in particular the Eastern part of the Mediterranean
and the Middle-East. The Assembly will not accept the non-respect
by any member State of the fundamental principles and values of
the Council of Europe in respect of human rights, democracy and
the rule of law. It will also seek to foster a dialogue with the
non-member States on the Southern shore. In this respect, I refer
to the recent participation of the Speaker of the Egyptian Parliament
in the Assembly, when he underlined that: 
<P>
&quot;Europe as a shrine of democracy has on its shoulders double
responsibility, one is internal, and the other is external toward
its Southern neighbours&quot;.<BR>

<P>
Secondly, the Council of Europe could contribute to the implementation
of the Declaration adopted by the Euro-Mediterranean Conference
held in Barcelona in November 1995, in specific fields of its
competence such as culture, education, human rights, immigration,
and the fight against intolerance, xenophobia and racism.<BR>

<P>
Thirdly, increased co-operation among the Mediterranean countries
could be fostered by the North-South Centre.<BR>

<P>
However such existing or new forms of co-operation are contingent
on the political will on all sides, and on whether or not stability
and peace can be maintained in the more troubled parts of the
Mediterranean. <BR>

<P>
In all events, the Council of Europe's contribution will have
to be modest in financial terms, but may be very significant in
political terms. One cannot underestimate the vital role of the
Council of Europe in maintaining and strengthening human rights,
democracy and the rule of law in its member States and its effects
on the Council's immediate neighbours. The need for improved forms
of Europe-Mediterranean co-operation exist. The Council of Europe's
efforts can only act as a catalyst. They will have an effect only
if made in conjunction with the political will and development
efforts of all the Mediterranean partners.

<B>EUROPEAN SECURITY AND THE MEDITERRANEAN<BR>
<BR>
</B>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Guido LENZI</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>, Director,
Institute for Security Studies, Western European Union, Paris</FONT>
<HR>

<P>
Here in Malta, a few months ago, we heard President Arafat state
that &quot;security is a way of life&quot; : an important recognition
of the new international attitude in the post-Cold War era, where
confrontation and ideological intransigence have given way to
participation, co-operation and compromise. International security
has undergone radical changes, not only in posture but also in
mentality. Deepening and enlargement are the two directions of
the systemic change that is underway in Europe, with the intent
of projecting security eastward in Mitteleuropa, but also southward
in the Mediterranean. The Barcelona conference, which established
the Euro-Mediterranean partnership, mentioned security only in
its preventive aspects, political and diplomatic, assuming that
the relevant co-operative defence mechanisms would follow suit.
They now have to be addressed openly, without the ambiguities
and misunderstandings of the past.<BR>

<P>
The OSCE established European security mechanisms, which evolved
after the fall of the Wall. Are they suitable for the whole Mediterranean?
And if not, what adjustments could be made to satisfy regional
specificities? The first step can only be broader transparency
and dialogue. Barcelona set a similar framework and method, embracing
the whole region, regardless of the obvious local differences
of situations and perceptions. Security as such was kept aside,
on hold, until other practical prerequisites are in place. The
field should be opened before it can be leveld, and multifaceted
interconnections established, as a prerequisite for transparency,
mutual understanding and trust.<BR>

<P>
In Europe and elsewhere, defence is no longer so much a matter
of territorial defence, but rather of co-operative endeavours,
along the lines drawn by the WEU &quot;common concept&quot;, by
the new &quot;enlargement concept&quot; of NATO, and by OSCE behavioural
principles. This requires, in each country, North and South, not
only more specific commitments and training for peace support
operations, but mainly a more extensive information of public
and parliamentary opinions, to ensure the support that is necessary
for consistency, political sustainability and financing purposes.
<BR>

<P>
This presupposes a more coherent multilateral context, in which
national production of and contribution to security is as important
as the consumption of it, from which many benefitted in the fifty
years under the bipolar stalemate. Furthermore, the new multi-dimensional
and transnational challenges produce at the same time a globalisation
and a fragmentation of the responses. The erosion of state authority
under the pressure of the most varied &quot;self-determinations&quot;
can only be restored by international co-operative endeavours,
in many fields that were up to now the preserve of sovereign national
prerogatives.<BR>

<P>
Today, once a crisis has erupted, it is difficult to intervene,
contain and reabsorb. Prevention and mediatory interposition is
the name of the new game, which implies also interventions in
internal affairs. The UN itself, after the experiences of Somalia
and Bosnia, with their mixture of Chapter 6 and Chapter 7 of the
Charter, is not willing to engage directly in peace enforcement
any more, and will increasingly rely on regional arrangements
duly mandated under the provisions of Chapter 8. Sub-regional
aggregation and agreements are therefore indispensable for stability
and security purposes, which external interventions can only supplement,
not substitute. Especially in the many so-called &quot;out-of-area&quot;
contingencies, ad hoc mechanisms by the &quot;willing and able&quot;
are the most adequate to adjust to the shifting and unforeseeable
combinations and variable factors. Variable geometries and hard
cores apply to every country, whether it already belongs or aspires
to European security architectures (which should in itself dispel
any misperception of a Western hegemonic fortress).<BR>

<P>
This is how things stand in continental Europe. The same principles
and mechanisms should apply to the areas contiguous to it, first
and foremost to the Mediterranean. Strategically, the Mediterranean
area is not a coherent system, its problems are not military in
nature, sub-regional diversities are great. But a common mentality
must spread, similar to that which is applicable to Europe.<BR>

<P>
The WEU &quot;Common concept 27&quot; states that &quot;the Mediterranean
basin is a high priority for European security ... (calling for)
guidelines for co-operation (and) permanent dialogue&quot;, recognising
that there is no direct military threat from the South. Barcelona
has indicated the same initial stepping-stones. Soft security
measures, dispelling misperceptions, could consist in exchanges
of information, an inventory of the commitments undertaken, a
comparison of experiences, a review of co-operative models (for
peacekeeping operations, crisis prevention, consultation, assistance
- in particular within OAU; for non-proliferation; for the containment
of new risks). <BR>

<P>
An evolutionary process is underway, rather than a state of affairs,
in each of our countries, in continental Europe as well as in
the Mediterranean. For mutual relations to develop, the rediscovery
of one's own and each others' identities is a prerequisite, that
must involve the participation of all of the strands of our civil
societies.<BR>

<P>
Even the military instrument is nowadays subjected to these multiple
factors, as it adapts to a new preventive role, under conditions
of greater transparency. Prevention is the overriding requirement,
involvement rather than containment the new imperative. Transparency
and exchange of views and experiences are the essential instruments.
Pluralism of contributions constitute at the same time the goal
and the prerequisite for further advances.<BR>

<P>
In the Mediterranean, the North-South relationship must expand,
but it presupposes a South-South two-way street. European states
individually and the Commission must evolve beyond their bilateral
relationships with North African states. The Fifteen cannot however
deal with the North Africans one by one, lest they be accused
of ganging up: Europe, as Kissinger used to remind Europeans,
needs to dial &quot;one telephone number&quot; to reach most usefully
its North African partners.<BR>

<P>
After the Ministerial Council of Petersberg in June 1992, the
Mediterranean Group of the WEU indicated seven principles that
should inspire the Euro-Mediterranean endeavour in the security
field. They are: dialogue, transparency, confidence, conflict
prevention, sufficiency, peaceful settlement of conflicts and
non-proliferation of armaments.<BR>

<P>
Now that a broader concept of security is being accepted also
in the Mediterranean, the opportunity exists of addressing the
relevant military concepts, starting with CSBMs. They should achieve
transparency (through communications, exchanges, common strategic
language), co-operation (in PKOs also within OAU, humanitarian/civil
protection, nonproliferation and the tackling of new risks), working
groups (for bilateral, trilateral co-operative purposes), and
multinational operational endeavours (such as manoeuvres and exercises).
<BR>
<BR>

<P>
With such CSCMs, collective security would develop, as a process,
incrementally, in the Mediterranean as usefully as in continental
Europe, in the context of the partnership established in Barcelona.
<BR>

<P>
Since Barcelona, WEU within EU and the Mediterranean have a clear
road ahead of them. Political will should combine the evolving
events to provide the energy for all parties concerned to proceed
with a converging purpose, even if with different national contributions.

<B>Subject</B>: Spaces Beyond National Jurisdiction
<P>
Professor Kappeler presents the following paper:<A NAME="intro1">
</A><HR>

<H3><B>WHICH ARE THE SPACES BEYOND NATIONAL JURISDICTION?</B>
</H3>

<H4><B>Introduction</B></H4>

<P>
The expression &quot;spaces beyond the limits of State jurisdiction&quot;
appears to imply that there is a clear limit to spaces under State
jurisdiction. This, increasingly, is no longer the case. States
exercise residual jurisdiction beyond the limits of spaces traditionally
attributed to them, and they continue to exercise jurisdiction
over objects and human beings in spaces beyond their jurisdiction
as a result of which their responsibility may be engaged by incidents
caused by such objects or human beings. Conversely, their jurisdiction
over spaces traditionally attributed to them is increasingly restricted
by rules of international law. Moreover, the physical limits of
the spaces under State jurisdiction are often in doubt, or there
are different limits for different aspects of State jurisdiction.
<P>
Before considering the spaces which essentially escape State jurisdiction,
we would thus like to briefly consider the limits of spaces traditionally
under the jurisdiction of individual States.
<H4><B>The physical limits of State jurisdiction</B></H4>

<P>
States exercise their jurisdiction over their territory which
comprises land, inland waters and, in most cases, a stretch of
territorial sea, as well as over the air space covering this land
and waters. On land and inland waters, borders delimit the jurisdiction
of one State with regard to that of others. This may also be true
on sea, as regards the jurisdiction over territorial waters of
geographically adjacent States as well as where the sea space
separating two States is so narrow as not to exceed the width
of their combined territorial waters.
<P>
Where a State faces a wider sea space the limits of its jurisdiction
are gradual. Full jurisdiction ends at the outer limit of territorial
waters<A HREF="#footnotes" >(1) </A><B>.</B> Residual jurisdiction
ends for the most part at the outer limit of the contiguous zone
<A HREF="#footnotes" >(2) </A>. However a few elements of jurisdiction
remain up to the outer limits of the exclusive economic zone<A HREF="#footnotes" >(3)  
</A>. Finally, where the continental shelf<A HREF="#footnotes" >(4)  
</A>extends beyond the limits of the exclusive economic zone of
the waters covering it, the coastal State retains jurisdiction
over that shelf in spite of the fact that the waters covering
this part are definitely beyond such jurisdiction.
<P>
The limits of the air space over a State's territory and territorial
waters with respect to outer space are in dispute<A HREF="#footnotes" >(5)  
</A>. Several theories have been advanced in this regard and,
for the purposes of codification of law, arbitrary limits have
been proposed by some but rejected by others. This means that
for different purposes the upper limit of a given State's air
space may be set at different altitudes. As regards air space
over seas beyond the outer limits of the territorial waters, it
is no longer under the jurisdiction of the coastal State<A HREF="#footnotes" >(6)  
</A>.
<H4><B>The Antarctic Continent<A HREF="#footnotes" >(7) </A></B>
</H4>

<P>
Over time many States have claimed slices of Antarctica. Such
claims are however frozen as long as the Antarctica Treaty of
1959 remains in force. As a result the legal regime of the Antarctic
Continent is determined by international law and State jurisdiction,
as far as it is allowed to exist, is determined and limited by
that law.
<P>
Most legal norms governing Antarctica are found in the Treaty
itself and in the growing number of secondary texts adopted pursuant
to it. The current list of legal texts governing Antarctica is
as follows:
<P>
- Antarctic Treaty or 1959
<P>
- Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals, 1972
<P>
- Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources,
1980
<P>
- Convention on the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resource Activities,
1988
<P>
- Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty,
1991, with annexes<A HREF="#footnotes" >(8) </A>
<P>
As can be seen from the above, the legal regime of Antarctica
extends beyond its land mass and covers a sizeable expanse of
the waters surrounding it, at least as far as protection of living
resources and the environment is concerned.
<H4><B>The Arctic Ocean<A HREF="#footnotes" >(9) </A></B></H4>

<P>
Not so long ago, this region was governed only by the international
law of the sea. However, the fact that large parts are covered
with more or less permanent ice and the discovery that, like the
Antarctic Continent, this maritime region plays a fundamental
role in the ecological equilibrium of the world, have led to the
adoption of special rules by coastal States surrounding the Arctic
Ocean and joint endeavours to further develop the nascent specific
legal regime. Besides a number of bilateral treaties dealing with
specific parts of the Ocean such as the Barents Sea and the and
the Spitsbergen (Svalbard) Archipelago<A HREF="#footnotes" >(10)  
</A><B>,</B> representatives of Arctic countries have met since
1989 to review the problems of the region and the possibilities
and means of dealing with them. In June 1991 they adopted a lengthy
document known as Arctic Environmental Protection Strategy<A HREF="#footnotes" >(11)  
</A>.
<H4><B>The High Seas<A HREF="#footnotes" >(12) </A></B></H4>

<P>
Until the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea becomes legally
binding on most maritime nations as a result of its entering into
force with regard to them, or until such time as its essential
provisions have become universal customary law, both the delimitation
and the regime of the high seas are in a state of confusion and
controversy. For the moment, only the four conventions
<P>
adopted in Geneva provide rules accepted by a seizable number
of maritime countries:
<P>
- Convention on the Territorial Sea and Contiguous Zone
<P>
- Convention on the High Seas
<P>
- Convention on Fishing and Conservation of the Living Resources
of the High Seas
<P>
- Convention on the Continental Shelf
<P>
Otherwise the only rules that are generally applicable are those
of traditional customary international law, and these mainly provide
for more or less unlimited freedom. There are of course conventions
on fishing and the protection of certain species as well as regarding
marine pollution which have been widely accepted by maritime nations
and thus provide a more acceptable legal regime in the fields
they cover:
<P>
- International Convention on the Regulation of Whaling, 1946
<P>
- International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution of
the Sea by Oil, 1954
<P>
- Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapons Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer
Space and under Water, 1963
<P>
- International Convention Relating to Intervention on the High
Seas in Case of Oil Pollution Casualties, 1969
<P>
- International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution
Damage, 1969
<P>
- Treaty on the Prohibition of the Emplacement of Nuclear Weapons
and Other Weapons of Mass Destruction on the Seabed and Ocean
Floor and in the Subsoil Thereof, 1971
<P>
- Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping
of Wastes and Other Matter, 1972
<P>
- International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from
Ships, 1973, amended in 1978
<P>
As for the air space covering the seas beyond the territorial
waters of coastal States<A HREF="#footnotes" >(13) </A>, the main
concern of legal regimes adopted so far is aviation. Only recently
have efforts been initiated to deal with the protection of this
part of the globe's air space against pollution and other undesirable
immissions. In particular, efforts to protect the ozone layer
and to prevent global warming and other forms of climate change
affect air space over the seas as much as national air spaces.
<H4><B>Outer Space<A HREF="#footnotes" >(14) </A></B></H4>

<P>
This part of the universe became relevant in legal terms only
since humanity developed the means of entering it with technical
devices and even vessels carrying human beings. As far as the
Earth's environment is concerned, only a tiny segment of outer
space can be affected by human technology. But that part, because
it interacts with the atmosphere and the Earth's surface itself,
is of course of greatest importance for the future of our globe
and its inhabitants.
<P>
Legal norms governing outer space seek to remove it and the natural
objects it contains from any attempts at accaparation by individual
States or groups of States while at the same time preventing States
from using those regions for military purposes or polluting them
with man-made objects sent into it. In both these latter regards,
international efforts so far have only been partly successful.
The main legal texts are:
<P>
- Declaration of Legal Principles Governing the Activities of
States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, 1962
<P>
- Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the
Exploration and Use of Outer Space, Including the Moon and Other
Celestial Bodies, 1967
<P>
- Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space
Objects, 1976
<P>
- Agreement Governing the Activities of States on the Moon and
Other Celestial Bodies, 1979
<H4><B>The relevance of regimes as regards environmental protection
</B></H4>

<P>
In the case of the arctic and antarctic regions, regimes already
set up or in the making will probably allow for comprehensive
systems to regulate the protection of the local environment. However,
because these regions are very much affected by what happens elsewhere,
in particular in the seas, in the air and in outer space, the
effectiveness of such overall regulatory systems is dependent
on how environmental problems are handled in other parts of the
world.
<P>
As regards these other parts, the absence of generally applicable
legal norms seems to militate in favour of the punctual approach
followed so far. Specific aspects of environmental protection
and rehabilitation must be tackled in such a manner that rules
adopted also apply to terrestrial and celestial spaces beyond
State jurisdiction or regarding which the existence and extent
of State jurisdiction is in doubt or a subject of controversy.
Another approach which has proved useful in the past and merits
to be pursued in the future is the regional approach<A HREF="#footnotes" >(15)  
</A>. The Mediterranean is a good example in this regard<A HREF="#footnotes" >(16)  
</A>.
<P>
Its coastal States have come to realise that survival of the Sea
itself as a living entity is only possible if they act in concert,
irrespective of political, economic and military conflicts which
otherwise may divide them. One must hope that this Colloquium
will help to add new impetus to efforts currently under way to
further strengthen and develop measures to safeguard and even
rehabilitate the Mediterranean Sea. Success achieved in a geographically
limited area may also become a stimulant for similar efforts elsewhere
and even at the global level.<A NAME="discus1"></A><HR>

<H3><B>DISCUSSION</B></H3>

<P>
<B>Mr. Micallef</B> noted that scholars, lawyers and diplomats
can not work credibly if they are ignorant of how their national
government and administration function.
<P>
<B>Professor Serracino Inglott</B> asked Professor Attard whether
it would not be better to adopt a general regime of the atmosphere
as in the case of the Law of the Sea rather than a convention
on climate change alone.
<P>
<B>Professor Attard </B>agreed that a general regime should be
the objective. In Ottawa there was however a lot of hostility
to such a venture, whereas there existed some feeling of urgency
with regard to the need to protect the climate worldwide. What
was unusual in the proceedings was that the UN imposed a deadline
for the completion of a draft as a reflection of the urgency of
the situation. Existing sectorial regimes however already contain
some elements for an overall regime to be adopted later. One should
also note that the draft convention on climate change mostly contains
principles which will have to be implemented by more detailed
rules to figure in protocols.
<P>
<B>Professor Birnie</B> wondered whether one should be talking
about boundaries at all. She suggested discussion of regimes rather
than areas. She disagreed with Prof. Kappeler's statement that
boundaries are not properly defined in law as there is a lot of
solid customary law in this field.
<P>
<B>Dr. Keckes</B> agreed that one should not concentrate on the
definitions of boundaries but more on the regulating activities.
Even the Mediterranean Action Plan found it impossible to define
the limits of its spatial scope.
<P>
<B>Dr. Raftopoulos</B> felt that this is not a question of technicality
but responsibility. In environmental matters one should stress
the functional aspects of international law.
<P>
<B>Professor Birnie</B> also disagreed with the idea that only
pollution matters in extraterritorial spaces. Due attention must
be given to living resources.
<P>
<B>Dr. Simone Borg</B> noted that international law is still too
immature not to consider boundaries in diplomacy. We have to deal
with sovereign States and boundaries are needed to delimit areas
of jurisdiction.
<P>
<B>Professor Serracino Inglott</B> reminded the participants that
the sovereignty concept is not part of the essence of international
law. In medieval times it hardly played a role.
<P>
<B>Dr. Mifsud</B> pointed out that there are other impacts on
extra-territorial and faraway areas than pollution of air and
water. Certain technologies can unleash hurricanes over great
distances and also cause floods.
<P>
<B>Dr. Raftopoulos</B> agreed with Professor Serracino Inglott
that the concept of sovereignty was unknown to the founders of
international law.
<P>
<B>Professor Attard</B> said that he could sympathise with the
diplomat's dilemma of having to respect sovereignty while dealing
with problems transgressing this concept. This is why he had suggested
to consider the climate a common concern of mankind, as a means
to overcome the sovereignty impasse. This was largely accepted.
<P>
<B>Professor Kappeler </B>concluded that whereas problems, concern
and solutions to be sought as regards the preservation of the
environment are universal, yet those who have to deal with them
are States still attached to their sovereignty. As their responsibility
may be engaged for areas under their control, the delimitation
of the latter remains necessary.<A NAME="footnotes"></A><HR>

in Encyclopedia, loc.cit., vol. 11, p. 303 on p. 307. Physical
criteria have mainly been used, e.g. the point where aircraft
is no longer carried by the too rarefied air or the point where
orbiting satellites are slowed down by the resistance of air particles.
Modern space technology which has produced spacecraft that can
also be used as aircraft (like the space shuttle) makes such criteria
difficult to apply. Arbitrary limits of 100 and 300 km have also
been postulated. Matters are further complicated by the claim
of equatorial countries to the space segment in which geostationary
satellites can be stationed.

<B>Subject</B>: Scientific Aspects of Environmental Degradation
and Remedies to it
<P>
The chairman singled out the following key points to be considered
from a scientific perspective:
<OL>
<LI>What is degradation? How should one define it? For example
there are some views that climate changes do not necessarily cause
a degradation of the environment.
<LI>How do we learn about changes likely to produce a degradation
of the environment?
<LI>How can degradation be measured?
</OL>

<P>
The attempt to answer these questions raises the problem of certainty
in science that has important implications on legal administrative
and political fields.
<P>
Dr. Pernetta at the request of the Chair, made some preliminary
remarks which he later consolidated in the following study:<A NAME="intro2">

<H3><B>ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION OF SPACES BEYOND THE LIMITS OF
NATIONAL JURISDICTION: SCIENTIFIC AND MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS
</B></H3>

<H4><B>Introduction<A HREF="#endnotes" >(1) </A></B></H4>

<P>
This paper considers only the scientific and managerial aspects
of environmental degradation of the oceans and atmosphere (including
the troposphere). Issues relating to inner and outer space beyond
the limits of the atmosphere, and space &quot;litter&quot; are
not discussed. The particular environmental problems of the Antarctic
Continent which is subject to special
<P>
treaty arrangements and where territorial claims are currently
suspended under the present Antarctic Treaty, are also excluded
from this brief overview.
<P>
At the outset it is worth noting that from a scientific or environmental
perspective the limits of national jurisdiction are artificial
boundaries which in most cases have no environmental reality.
Regulation of human activities and environmental management actions
therefore take place within a framework based on social, legal
and cultural systems which have been generally developed for purposes
other than protection of the environment and maintenance of natural
productivity.
<P>
The failure of management units to follow natural system boundaries
leads to difficulties of sustainable use and maintenance of environmental
quality. In addition legal boundaries are normally static, derived
from some spatially fixed point or recognisable, agreed baseline,
whereas environmental boundaries are generally dynamic, changing
on diurnal, seasonal, annual and longer term bases. Anthropogenic
activities in one compartment of the biosphere can and do have
impacts and consequences at considerable distance from their sources;
due in part at least to natural cycles, such as the hydrological
cycle; and processes, both physical, such as basin scale ocean
currents, and biological, such as long distance migration.
<P>
It is important to recognise in the first instance that all living
organisms affect their physical surroundings, and indeed that
the first photosynthetic organisms to appear on earth had a major
effect both on the composition of the atmosphere and the chemistry
of the oceans (Siever, 1975). Pre-life atmosphere was dominated
by water, methane and ammonia; both oxygen and tropospheric ozone
were absent. The emergence of simple photosynthetic organisms
around a billion years ago, resulted in production of atmospheric
oxygen which, by the beginning of the palaeozoic era 600 million
years ago, was at sufficiently high concentrations to permit the
evolution of consumer organisms, which fed upon the autotrophic
photosynthesing organisms. On much shorter time scales the actions
of animals affect the rate and direction of plant succession and
hence the characteristic vegetation of an area.
<P>
Changes to the vegetation in turn affect the cycling of water
and nutrients and the rate of soil formation and loss through
erosion and transport to the marine environment.
<P>
It should come as no surprise therefore that a species as abundant
and widespread as humanity impacts the environment resulting in
physical and biological changes to the world's ecosystems and
global processes. A priori one should have anticipated this. Whilst
the scale of human impacts may now appear obvious, particularly
in the light of present ideas concerning global climate change
and ozone depletion, such a possibility received little attention
in the last century when Arrhenius first postulated the idea that
man might have an effect on global climate. The relatively recent
acceptance of this idea that the scale of human-induced changes
could affect global processes and systems, reflects the rapid
improvement in scientific knowledge and the recent development
of tools and technologies which enable us to measure different
kinds of environmental change.
<H4><B>Environmental Degradation: Causes and Effects</B></H4>

<P>
In general the sources of environmental degradation of spaces
beyond the limits of national jurisdiction result from:
<P>
- Landbased activities occurring within national jurisdiction;
<P>
- Maritime and aerial transport activities;
<P>
- Living marine resource exploitation;
<P>
- Offshore mineral exploration and exploitation;
<P>
- Marine dumping and incineration.
<P>
These result in:
<P>
- Contamination and pollution;
<P>
- Changes in atmospheric composition and chemistry;
<P>
- Changes in ocean chemistry;
<P>
- Marine resource depletion;
<P>
- Global climate change and sea level rise.
<H4><B>The Atmosphere</B></H4>

<P>
Sources of change
<P>
Changes in atmospheric composition result from a variety of human,
landbased activities. Agriculture increases atmospheric methane
concentrations both from paddy rice and stock production. Global
estimates of the rate of increase in atmospheric methane demonstrate
a clear relationship with increasing human populations (UNEP,
1987). Forest clearance for alternate land use reduces the biomass
sink of carbon dioxide and if accompanied by burning results in
increased flux of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere.
<P>
Agrochemicals including both pesticides and fertilisers, applied
in intensive agriculture may enter the atmosphere and be transported
over considerable distances prior to subsequent degradation and/or
deposition on land or in the ocean. Through the processes of leaching
and runoff such chemicals may also enter the coastal ocean, ultimately
finding their way into water masses beyond the exclusive economic
zones of the originating State.
<P>
Industrial development results in an increased rate of consumption
of fossil fuels and hence an increased rate of carbon dioxide
production into the atmosphere. In addition industries create
a wide variety of atmospheric pollutant gases such as sulphur
dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrous oxide and xenobiotic gases such
as chlorofluorocarbons together with fine particulate matter and
aerosols of varying chemical composition and toxicity.
<P>
Pathways
<P>
Whilst many of the gaseous contaminants and pollutants entering
the atmosphere have a short lifespan, being quickly dissolved
in water droplets and subsequently deposited on land or ocean,
others may have long residence times in the atmosphere, causing
changes to its overall gaseous composition and chemistry. In general
shortlived contaminants have greater impacts
<P>
within the areas of national jurisdiction, whilst longerlived
contaminants can and do impact environmental spaces beyond the
limits of national jurisdiction.
<P>
Contaminants can travel in the atmosphere either as gases or as
aerosol particles; phosphorus and all trace metals except mercury
travel in association with aerosol particles while fixed organic
nitrogen can travel as gases or as aerosols. Generally contaminant
substances are injected into the atmosphere at or near the surface
of the earth, are mixed vertically and transported hundreds to
thousands of kilometres from the site of emission. Because most
sources are generally in northern midlatitudes, most transport
is from west to east with North America contributing to the north
Atlantic and the Asian areas contributing to the North Pacific.
In the trade wind zones however transport may be from East to
West, resulting in for example transport of contaminants from
Latin America across the Pacific towards Hawaii.
<P>
The state of the atmosphere
<P>
There can be no dispute that the gaseous composition of the atmosphere
is changing, with measurable increases in radiatively active gases
such as carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and chlorofluorocarbons
(Siegenthaler &amp; Sanhueza, 1991). Tropospheric ozone is continuing
to decrease in concentration, and these changes are observable
throughout the atmosphere. The concentration of shortlived atmospheric
contaminants and pollutants is highly variable from region to
region.
<P>
The issues of transboundary air pollution are addressed within
the context of a number of regional conventions and international
declarations. The issues of widespread changes to atmospheric
quality in terms of ozone depletion and greenhouse gas buildup
are addressed through the Vienna Convention, the Montreal Protocol
and the Climate Convention. By and large the wording of these
conventions is related solely to controlling the effects of one
State's actions or omissions on the areas under the jurisdiction
of another State.
<P>
The protection of the environmental quality of spaces outside
national jurisdiction is by and large not directly addressed in
the context of international legal agreements. Where the state
of extranational environments is addressed in the context of international
agreements, consideration is limited to human use and enjoyment
of such space and the possible consequences of human-induced changes
to such use and enjoyment.
<H4><B>The Ocean</B></H4>

<P>
Contaminants and pollutants enter the ocean via leaching, runoff
and discharge from land, via dumping and incineration, maritime
transport and offshore production and via the atmosphere (44%;
10%; 12%; 1%; &amp; 33% respectively; GESAMP, 1990).
<P>
Not all landbased sources of change in the ocean fit a strict
definition of contamination or pollution, since human activities
may merely increase the rate of natural processes such as erosion.
It is interesting to note in this regard that human landbased
activities such as forest clearance, overgrazing, mining and construction
have dramatically increased the flux of sediments to the ocean.
It has been estimated that human induced changes have resulted
in a doubling of sediment inputs into the coastal ocean since
the industrial revolution. Such a change is measurable in geological
terms. More recently widespread dam construction for hydropower
and freshwater management has had the reverse effect, reducing
sediment and nutrient inputs to coastal waters and resulting in
the collapse of fisheries such as the sardine fishery off the
Nile Delta in the Mediterranean.
<P>
Landbased sources of marine pollution
<P>
The most recent GESAMP report on the State of the Marine Environment
(GESAMP, 1990) states that dissolved nutrient fluxes in rivers
resulting from human activities are at least comparable to and
probably significantly larger than the natural fluxes (15, 1,
&amp; 100 Mt yr1 for nitrogen, phosphorus and silicon respectively).
The bulk of these are removed or retained within
<P>
estuarine and continental shelf areas under national jurisdiction
and in the case of nitrogen and phosphorus only an estimated 0.44
and 0.3 Mt yr are thought to enter the open ocean. Estimates of
trace metal contaminants entering the open ocean are variable,
depending upon the database and the method of estimation employed,
while global estimates of synthetic organic compounds are not
possible due to the complex chemistry of the substances involved
and their heterogeneous distribution.
<P>
Atmospheric pathways of marine pollution
<P>
Sources of atmospheric trace metals include natural and manmade
inputs and both global and regional estimates of emissions are
available (Pacnya, 1986). Atmospheric fluxes of trace metals to
the ocean vary regionally, depending on proximity to continental
sources, with the North Sea and Mediterranean generally displaying
the highest values and the tropical South Pacific the lowest.
In the case of mercury there is little regional variation since
mercury is transported in the gaseous phase as opposed to aerosol
particles. Organic substances of concern include pesticides and
Polychlorinated Biphenols (PCB's) and polyaromatic hydrocarbons
(PAH's). In the latter case no reliable global estimates are available.
<P>
Comparison of atmospheric and riverine inputs of pollutants
<P>
The relative importance of the two possible routes for contaminant
and pollutants entering the marine environment varies considerably
from region to region, and for many regions data are not available.
However available information suggests that river inputs are generally
more important in areas of the ocean under national jurisdiction
whilst atmospheric inputs are more important in open ocean areas.
In the case of the North Atlantic and North Sea however it would
appear that atmospheric inputs of lead, zinc and cadmium substantially
exceed those of rivers. In the case of nutrients such as nitrogen
most of the river based inputs are trapped within the coastal
zone resulting in atmospheric inputs of nitrogen to the open ocean
dominating. In contrast riverine inputs of phosphorous are more
important than atmospheric sources.
<P>
Marine based sources of pollution
<P>
Marine based sources of pollution associated with international
shipping, maritime transport and offshore mineral production have
generally declined over the last two decades although accidents
involving oil well blowouts and tanker spillages may have major
impacts locally. In general marine based sources of pollution
have their greatest impacts in coastal waters under national jurisdiction,
although oil slicks and plastic litter are found in all major
sea lanes and ocean incineration and dumping continue in some
areas.
<P>
Exploitation of marine resources
<P>
Changes to the marine environment have resulted from the use of
marine species largely for human and animal feedstuff. It has
been estimated by FAO (1985) that around 75% of all marine resources
are taken from within 9 Kilometres of the shore, and that the
present yield of around 100 million metric tonnes per annum represents
the maximum sustainable yield from presently exploited global
fisheries resources. It is further estimated that by the year
2000 the total increase in demand for fisheries products will
equal around an additional 20 Million metric tonnes annually.
To-date the impacts of harvesting marine resources have therefore
been felt in areas under national jurisdiction, and include overexploitation,
habitat degradation and changes to species composition.
<P>
Although the existence of unexploited stocks is probably limited,
the possibility that technologies will be developed for exploiting
bathypelagic fish stocks and mesopelagic stocks of squid must
be considered. In addition stocks of nontraditional species such
as krill, may be exploited at much higher levels in the future
for animal feed. Such stocks are by and large found in areas of
the open ocean outside national jurisdiction. Current open ocean
fisheries involve exploiting shallow swimming transboundary and
migratory species such as the pelagic tunas. The use of environmentally
damaging technologies, such as the massive drift nets employed
by Asian longdistance fishing fleets in the Pacific, is a cause
of particular concern to small coastal and archipelagic States
for whom such resources represent one of the major if not the
sole source of development income.
<P>
State of the open ocean
<P>
The 1989 GESAMP report on the State of the Marine Environment
states:
<P>
1. In 1989 man's fingerprint is found everywhere in the Oceans.
Chemical contamination and litter can be observed from the poles
to the tropics and from beaches to abyssal depths. But conditions
in the marine environment vary widely.
<P>
2. The open sea is still relatively clean. Low levels of lead,
synthetic organic compounds and artificial radionuclides, though
widely detectable, are biologically insignificant. Oil slicks
and litter are common along sea-lanes, but are, at present, of
minor consequence to communities of organisms living in openocean
waters.&quot; (Executive summary, GESAMP, 1990).
<P>
It further suggests that no area or resource has yet been irrevocably
damaged or destroyed and that in the immediate future increasing
rates of environmental degradation might be expected to occur
primarily within the coastal zones; that is areas within national
jurisdiction. It might be inferred from the above discussion,
however that degradation of the environmental quality of ocean
areas beyond national jurisdiction will follow as a logical consequence
of dispersal and movement of contaminants and pollutants from
coastal to off shore waters; and as a consequence of rapid industrialisation
and development increasing the flux of airborne contaminants.
<P>
Threats posed by climate change and ozone depletion
<P>
In terms of general marine productivity open ocean areas are the
watery equivalent of deserts and most marine productivity is centred
in zones of upwelling where cold nutrient rich water is brought
to the surface and in coastal zones where nutrient inputs from
landbased sources are high. The overall impact of reduction in
the marine primary productivity of open ocean areas as a consequence
of increased UV radiation is likely to be small and of greater
concern are potential impacts in the more productive coastal areas,
at high latitudes.
<P>
The relationship between changes in major ocean circulation and
current patterns and the distribution and productivity of many
stocks of marine resources is well known and demonstrated as in
the case of the Japanese sardine fishery associated with the Kyushu
current and the Peruvian anchovetta fishery associated with the
Humboldt current (Kawasaki, 1991). In the latter case the pelagic
fishery collapses during El Nino years when warm surface water
from the western Pacific dominates the offshore areas (Escobar,
et al., 1988). Quite apart from the impacts that changes to global
air temperature may have on weather and climate, changes to ocean
surface water temperatures are likely to have major consequences
for the distribution and abundance of marine organisms including
planktonic species. Changes in species composition are likely
to occur at all levels of the food chain; the magnitude and duration
of primary production in temperate and higher latitude ocean areas
can be expected to change; and, spring peaks of production may
occur earlier in the year.
<P>
Such examples suggest the changes to major ocean currents and
oceanic primary productivity, which might arise as a consequence
of global warming and could affect the distribution and abundance
of marine resources in the open ocean. It is virtually impossible
to predict with any certainty, the scale and magnitude of such
impacts at the present time.
<P>
Scientific uncertainty
<P>
Although it is now possible to identify many of the point sources
of emission or discharge and the nature of pollutants and contaminants
entering the oceans and atmosphere considerable scientific uncertainty
continues to surround the fate and flux of such materials. In
addition the identification of diffuse sources of contaminants
and pollutants, or those which disperse widely through the atmosphere
or ocean is difficult and often such sources cannot be positively
pinpointed. Although the impacts, both potential and actual of
certain contaminants can be predicted with some accuracy, in the
case of others risk assessments and potential impacts are less
certain. The impacts of global climate change and ozone depletion
on environmental quality and the productivity of natural environments
outside national jurisdiction are as yet unclear.
<P>
In part this uncertainty reflects inadequate knowledge and understanding
of the foodwebs and natural productivity of marine systems, particularly
those occurring at depth, and in part uncertainties surrounding
the actual magnitude and extent of predicted changes in physical
variables such as water temperatures and ocean current patterns.
In addition recruitment rates of currently exploited stocks of
pelagic fish, their standing stocks, turnover-times and present
harvest rates are not sufficiently well quantified to permit accurate
modelling and prediction of sustainable yields.
<P>
For planning and management purposes science is expected to produce
accurate, precise and detailed statements in answer to questions
of what if ... ? Such an expectation on the part of decision-makers
is unrealistic at the present time and would require considerable
investment in data collection, modelling and analysis. It is imperative
therefore that any management regime, whether national, regional
or international take adequate account of existing scientific
uncertainties.
<P>
In the early days of the application of Environmental Impact Assessments
for example, the stance of the developer was often based on the
attitude &quot;the environmental scientist must prove that impacts
will occur before we concede the need for action&quot;. In general
the position of environmental science confronted with the need
to make predictions is well summarised by Jackson (1982) in writing
about the impacts of a major copper mine development in New Guinea
who states:
<P>
But the facts available are very few, casting perhaps as much
light as might a crescent moon on a man searching a medicine cabinet
full of poison for an aspirin to relieve a worrisome headache
....... the experts, if they are honest, will be keeping their
fingers crossed and their environmental monitoning systems under
constant scrutiny.
<P>
Increasing recognition of scientific uncertainties not only surrounding
global issues such as climate change impacts, but single development
activities involving resource exploitation has lead increasingly
to the adoption of a
<P>
precautionary approach. This approach assumes that where impacts
are likely to occur mitigatory measures should be adopted. This
approach differs significantly from the initial approach of industry
to EIAs outlined above; the onus is now on the developer or potential
polluter to prove that impacts will not occur.
<H4><B>Scientifically based management systems</B></H4>

<P>
Modern environmental science has its roots in the scientific discipline
of ecology whose most prominent founding exponent, Charles Elton,
recognised the vital imperative of understanding the linkages
between physical, and biological processes in shaping the environment
(Elton, 1927). The approaches of the science of ecology are essentially
holistic, a recognition that the sum of natural systems is greater
than the sum of their component parts. In concentrating on what
one might call human ecology, environmental science has lost this
holistic view, the environment is seen as the product of human
interaction with natural systems, and yet humanity is not seen
as being both dependent on, and an integral part of, the system
itself. Indeed the very concepts of sustainable use, wise management,
and integrated environmental management imply that humanity &quot;controls&quot;
what happens to environments rather than recognising that human
actions &quot;affect&quot; environments and vice versa.
<P>
The inability of science to accurately model and predict future
changes to natural and manmade systems with any degree of certainty
means that in reality we can neither, manage nor control environments
as environments, but only manage and control human actions which
we know will result in some impact on the physical and biological
surroundings. The limits to these effects both in spatial and
temporal terms are thus vitally important components of any management
system.
<P>
It is possible within the biosphere to recognise boundaries and
edges between different systems. Within the boundaries of any
one system energy and matter flow and circulate, whilst considerably
less energy and matter are exchanged across the boundaries of
such ecosystems. Human actions inside such a
<P>
system, whether these involve producing pollutants, changing habitats
or exploiting a natural resource will therefore have greater impacts
within the system than on neighbouring systems.
<P>
Ideally therefore scientifically based environmental management
systems must adopt two basic philosophical approaches:
<P>
a) Holistic (sometimes inaccurately referred to as integrated)
approaches to managing, controlling and regulating all human activities
simultaneously;
<P>
b) Recognition of environmental limits and boundaries in time
and space; and consequent adoption of management units which correspond
as closely as possible to &quot;real&quot; environmental units.
<P>
Implications for future management of areas beyond the limits
of national jurisdiction
<P>
It is important to recognise that existing national and internationally
agreed boundaries generally do not correspond to the boundaries
of environmental units (see p 190 In Elder &amp; Pernetta, 1991).
Thus the areas of the open ocean beyond the 200 mile exclusive
economic zones have no real integrity as functioning environmental
systems. Migratory stocks of important fish routinely move between
areas of the high seas and areas under national jurisdiction,
whilst pollutants and contaminants are transported and mixed by
atmospheric and ocean processes which are determined by factors
such as physical topography and climate.
<P>
Most boundaries adopted for legal purposes at all levels are the
result of historical, social, cultural and other human factors,
and the consequences for environmental protection and management
are frequently disastrous. The failure of countries in the GangesBrahmaputra
catchment to jointly regulate and manage their use of the watershed
and freshwater resources has profound consequences for downstream
neighbours and illustrates the problems of
<P>
reconciling environmental management with existing legal regimes
and national interests even within small regional and subregional
areas.
<P>
Often transboundary and migratory stocks are subject to exploitation
not only within a number of EEZ's but by distant water fishing
fleets. Whilst regional fisheries bodies attempt to advise governments
on the rates of sustainable harvest they have no power to enforce
exploitation rates and not all States involved in a fishery are
necessarily part of the regional fisheries body. Sustainable management
of such stocks is only possible when all parties involved in the
exploitation of such stocks cooperate in pooling data relating
to the stock itself and in determining total harvest limits and
their allocation between users.
<P>
It is salutary to realise that most individual States are incapable
at the present time of integrating their management and use of
environments and resources over which they have sole jurisdiction.
Many of the current widespread environmental problems of coastal
zones result directly from the sectoral approaches to development
and use which have been applied in the past. As noted elsewhere
(Pernetta, &amp; Elder, in press) such approaches work, only when
one use does not conflict with another. As human populations grow,
and resource consumption increases the potential and actual conflicts
between competing sectoral interests within States result in accelerating
rates of degradation. Although the need for integrated coastal
zone management is widely recognised internationally, no country
has successfully implemented such a programme to date. This does
not augur well for international management of spaces outside
national jurisdiction.
<P>
Whilst some international agreements and declarations attempt
to control the actions and omissions of one State which affect
neighbouring States, their effectiveness is limited. Legal mechanisms
including laws, conventions, protocols and other tools for regulating
actions can only function when the parties to the instrument agree
on the principles which form the basis for the agreement. This
viewpoint contrasts sharply with that of science. The view of
science is that facts are facts and that predictions can only
be made with a certain level of probability. The level of scientific
certainty depending on the nature of the available data and the
models, it is normal for scientists to
<P>
disagree on the consequences of particular courses of action.
Indeed agreement is rare and at least in environmental science
is normally based on the absence of evidence to refute a view
or theory rather than on the existence of absolute proof that
the theory is indeed correct.
<P>
Despite assertions to the contrary, there is not an &quot;international
scientific consensus&quot; that global warming will actually occur.
There are significant dissenters from this view and it is perhaps
salutary to remember that following the cooling which occurred
in the sixties scientific attention was directed towards the possibilities
of the next ice age rather than towards the prospects of a warmer
world. What currently exists is a majority opinion that warming
will occur and although the differences between these two expressions
might appear slight and semantic they are nevertheless significant
in terms of planning and management. Consensus implies the absence
of any possible alternative future whilst majority opinion implies
that real alternatives exist which must also be taken into account.
<H4><B>Conclusions</B></H4>

<P>
Despite the various scientific uncertainties action must be taken
in the face of global changes which are to some extent predictable:
including growing human populations; industrialisation and development;
and increasing consumption of the limited resource base of the
world. All too often the scientific uncertainties are used as
a basis for not agreeing to the principles, or as a basis for
failing to take action. Regrettable as it is, science does not
operate on the basis of consensus, hence there exists a need to
integrate the development of consensus based international legal
regimes with the probabilistic approaches of environmental science.
<P>
In the case of ocean and atmospheric spaces beyond national jurisdiction
it is possible to clearly and definitively state that changes
will occur in these areas as a consequence of growing human populations
and increasing consumption of natural resources. An ultimate precautionary
approach would be to take action designed to limit both the magnitude
and the direction of such changes despite our inability to predict
the impacts and consequences which such
<P>
changes might have on the environmental quality and productivity
of such areas.
<P>
Such actions should include:
<P>
a) The minimisation of waste emissions and discharge;
<P>
b) Storage and retention of waste emissions and discharges within
the environmental compartment or system in which they are produced;
<P>
c) Restriction of human activities which increase the natural
flux of materials and energy between environmental units (e.g.
land to sea);
<P>
d) Development of appropriate management systems and regimes for
resources currently or potentially exploited in extranational
spaces; and,
<P>
e) Integrated planning of sectoral use of environments and resources.
<HR>

<H3><B><A NAME="disco2"></A>DISCUSSION</B></H3>

<P>
<B>Dr. Boldirev</B> opened the discussion saying that scientists
should give initial signals for legal action which should result
in international regulations. He emphasised the problem of adequacy
of information and knowledge for successful actions. As regards
the relations between scientific and policy spheres, he mentioned
the additional difficulty that politicians demand to have precise
options, among which they can make a choice. From the scientific
point of view this is difficult to achieve.
<P>
<B>Professor Kappeler</B> stressed the problem of clear definition
of degradation. He said that it will be necessary to distinguish
evolution and normal processes from degradation. There is also
an interaction between the problems and attempts at remedying
them. Sometimes the solution adopted produces worse effects than
the problem itself. There is an need for constant dialogue between
science and law if one is to avoid shortcomings based on lack
of coordination.
<P>
<B>Mr. Micallef </B>said that the quality of legal rules is a
necessary but not sufficient condition for effective action. Bottlenecks
delaying environmental action are very often found at the administrative
level in States. Without effective administrative implementation
at national level many valid ideas and international legal instruments
become ineffectual. For example, although the Mediterranean Action
Plan (MAP) is considered a model of regional action by UNEP, there
are a lot of difficulties as regards its implementation due to
a lack of efficient action within member States. This is often
due to the absence of means for enforcement at both national and
regional levels.
<P>
<B>Dr. Spiteri </B>noted the usefulness of environmental auditing,
especially if done jointly by lawyers and scientists.
<P>
<B>Dr. Keckes</B> said that the problem of implementation is real.
The Barcelona Convention for example does not provide for effective
mechanisms of control and implementation. Mostly it relies on
voluntary implementation. To some extent this is due to the fact
that sovereignty-conscious States were pushed by
<P>
popular pressure to adopt regimes that do not reflect political
and economic realities. Moreover poor countries were sometimes
persuaded to accept a regime by the promise of financial assistance,
which then failed to materialise.
<P>
<B>Dr. Raftopoulos</B> confirmed that the Barcelona Convention
only requires reporting. Contributions to the trust fund might
be a means of enforcement, but this is prevented by the permissive
language used. Nevertheless the Convention anticipates the holistic
approach now favoured by stressing the mobility of boundaries.
<P>
<B>Professor Birnie</B> noted tendencies in the regional treaties
not to use enforcement mechanisms provided for by international
law. Parties are invited to &quot;take necessary measures&quot;.
Such tendencies reflect the need to accommodate many divergent
interests. On the other hand, newer regimes provide scientific
criteria for measuring their implementation and for serving as
basis for national rules to be enacted. The Convention on the
Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) unfortunately does not provide for mutual
inspection by the parties as do earlier more specific regimes.
More prominence should be given to the cautionary principle which
aims at preventing damage rather than providing remedies when
it already has happened.
<P>
<B>Dr. Mallia </B>deplored the absence of commonly agreed definitions
of what constitutes pollution and degradation and of minimum standards
for environmental protection at national level. Degradation of
the environment should be seen as a threat rather than an impediment
to development, although this is sometimes disputed. International
agencies often compete with one another rather than cooperating
in search of a joint approach.
<P>
<B>Ms. Spiteri</B> noted that the situation has improved thanks
to the availability of new technological tools such as computers
and observation satellites. This particularly applies to extra-territorial
spaces. Computer technology can improve the exchange of information.
<P>
<B>Dr. Keckes </B>said that lack of information is no longer a
problem. What is often missing is the political will at State
level to take appropriate action. Lack of cooperation and competition
between international agencies and institutions is mostly due
to competition among State agencies which send out conflicting
signals.
<P>
<B>Mr. Micallef </B>also agreed that there is no lack of knowledge.
What is missing is coordinated action at national levels, based
on cooperation of all concerned agencies.
<P>
<B>Professor Attard</B> said that there is indeed a proliferation
of treaties without effective implementation. Partly this is the
result of a lack of follow-up processes, including monitoring
systems at national and international levels. There is an important
role for science in creating such systems. Diplomats make treaties,
scientists should monitor their implementation. On the other hand,
the accumulation of declarations and resolutions constitutes a
type of international pressure that may produce action. Diplomats
should be backed by adequate environmental knowledge. UNITAR is
currently considering means of training diplomats in environmental
negotiations.
<P>
<B>Dr. Raftopoulos</B> said that vagueness of treaty provisions
reflects the need to accommodate divergent interests. It is necessary
to use a step-by-step approach, beginning with the establishment
of a global framework based on consensus. Thereafter concrete
measures of implementation, entailing strict legal obligations
can be adopted by way of protocols. Such an approach was adopted
in the case of the Barcelona Convention.
<P>
<B>Dr. Pernetta</B> noted that there area often misunderstandings
as regards scientific data. There is not a lack of information
but often the impossibility of any valid prediction that could
be derived from it. The concept of degradation implies a value
judgement which makes a scientific definition impossible.
<P>
Summing up the discussion, <B>Dr.Boldirev</B> noted the following:
<P>
1. Changes in extra-territorial spaces have occurred and can be
measured. Thus a monitoring system that would estimate what has
happened and what might happen is possible;
<P>
2. In dealing with environmental matters, a holistic approach
is needed, involving all disciplines;
<P>
3. Recommendations for national and international actions should
be worked out with those who will have to implement them;
<P>
4. Science cannot always identify who is responsible for a given
development. More reliance should therefore be put on damage prevention
and limitation through properly planned action (cautionary principle).

<P>
<B>Subject</B>: Scientific aspects of environmental degradation
and remedies to it: consideration of specific issues<A NAME="intro3">
</A><HR>

<P>
The Chairman opened the discussions by identifying four issues
for consideration:
<P>
1. The Open Sea
<P>
2. The Mediterranean
<P>
3. Climate as a global concern
<P>
4. Biodiversity
<P>
How much do we know about environmental state? What kind of recommendations
could be made for governments to establish international policies?
<A NAME="disco3"></A><HR>

<H3><B>DISCUSSION</B></H3>

<P>
<B>Professor Kappeler</B> asked whether the scarcity of fish on
the high seas as described by Dr. Pernetta in the morning also
applies in the Mediterranean.
<P>
<B>Professor Attard</B> wanted to know which are the primary sources
of pollution of the high seas from the atmosphere.
<P>
<B>Dr. Pernetta </B>answered that 33% of the pollution of the
high seas comes from the atmosphere, which acts as vehicle of
pollutants produced on land. Pollutants carried by the atmosphere
are aerosols and gases. Aerosols are dropped close to coastal
areas whereas gases can be transported over vast distances. Aerosols
consitute the bulk of pollutants which means that coastal
<P>
waters are more affected than high seas. As regards fishing, the
high seas can be considered the equivalent of deserts on land.
Lack of proper nutrients does not allow important fish populations
to exist.
<P>
<B>Dr. Keckes </B>added that the fisheries situation in the Mediterranean
is the same as worldwide. In addition there is a great difference
between northern and southern shores of that sea. The latter are
nearly devoid of prosperous fishing grounds. Most of the species
are currently overfished, so that depletion is a distinct menace.
<P>
<B>Mr. Micallef</B> noted that as far as pollution with heavy
metals is concerned, studies show that in the Mediterranean these
are carried mostly through the atmosphere. Land-based sources
of such pollutants have been identified.
<P>
<B>Dr. Keckes </B>explained that present models do not allow for
proper identification of the sources of pollutants carried by
air. A great part is likely to originate from distant hinterlands,
especially from northern Europe.
<P>
<B>Dr. Boldirev</B> wondered whether, in view of the modest living
resources of the high seas and of the fact that most airborne
pollutants do not reach them, there is much urgency in adopting
a legal regime for them.
<P>
<B>Professor Attard</B> pointed out that, as no country in the
Mediterranean has yet declared an exclusive economic zone, national
jurisdiction effectively ends at the limit of their contiguous
zone. This leaves a much larger proportion of high seas than on
the oceans.
<P>
<B>Dr. Boldirev</B> concluded from what had just been said that
the Mediterranean is more polluted than the oceans and that a
large proportion of its fishing areas are still beyond national
jurisdiction.
<P>
<B>Dr. Keckes </B>explained that the Mediterranean could be considered
as a small model for the oceans. Most fish caught are migratory
species whose spawning grounds are far removed from where it is
caught and lie mostly within areas of national jurisdiction (fishing
zones). Those spawning grounds therefore need international protection.
<P>
<B>Dr. Mallia</B> wondered whether the Black Sea should be considered
as part of the Mediterranean. She also drew attention to proposals
to tax tourists in order to raise funds for protecting the marine
environment.
<P>
<B>Mr. Micallef</B> reminded participants that the Mediterranean
represents less than 1% of the global maritime surface. As there
is very little exchange of waters with the Atlantic, anything
that happens within the Mediterranean remains there for a long
time. Sometimes phenomena do occur that attract the attention
of all Mediterranean States like the 1983/4 jellyfish invasion,
whose origin was never fully determined. It is however likely
that it lies in areas beyond national jurisdiction.
<P>
<B>Professor Kappeler</B> asked for information regarding the
importance of absorption of carbon gas by the oceans.
<P>
<B>Dr. Boldirev </B>replied that absorption capacity increases
with lower temperatures. It is estimated that about 50% of man-made
CO2 emitted into the atmosphere is absorbed by the oceans. This
might change with higher temperatures. The impact and final fate
of absorbed CO2 in the oceans is not yet known. This whole issue
underlines the importance of a holistic approach to environmental
phenomena and their consequences.
<P>
<B>Professor Attard</B> said that the IOC draft did not consider
CO2 absorption by the oceans because of the complexity of the
issue but instead only considered the impact of deforestation
on atmospheric CO2 content.
<P>
<B>Dr. Boldirev</B> noted that a warming of ocean temperature
could modify currents along the South American coasts to the detriment
of the hinterland. This should draw the attention of Amazonian
countries to the interest of stopping deforestation.
<P>
<B>Dr. Boldirev</B> as Chairman summed up the discussion by noting
that data gathered often create a need for more studies, observations
and research. It is important that responding to this need be
done in common by all concerned.<HR>

<H1>REPORT OF THE COLLOQUIUM ON NEUTRALITY AND NON-ALIGNMENT</H1>

<P>
<B>NOVEMBER 4-8, 1991</B>
<H2>INTRODUCTION</H2>

<P>
This Colloquium was convened by the Mediterranean Academy of Diplomatic
Studies and the Graduate Institute of International Studies in
Geneva to consider the impact of recent events and forseeable
future developments on the concepts on neutrality and non-alignment
and their implementation in State practice. Although over a year
has passed since the Colloquium took place, its debates and conclusions
have in no way been contradicted by what happened since. Indeed
much of the neutrality discussions currently under way in relation
with accession negotiations to the European Community with Austria,
Finland and Sweden closely reflect what was found in a more academic
context during the Colloquium.

</CENTER>
<P>
<IMG SRC="phi1.gif" align=left hspace=10>t was Donna Margherita's grand-daughter, Anna Muscati,
who on 13 October 1760 married the penniless Cavalier Don Domenico
Parisio of Reggio, Calabria.
<P>
The noble house of Parisio, seeing itself beset by enormous debts
and having studied how best to save itself from final ruin by
contracting a wealthy marriage, had cast an eye on Anna Muscati,
an heiress to a large fortune and one of the leading ladies of
Valletta.  Cavalier Don Domenico Parisio came over to Malta, to
woo her and often spoke of the large property which his family
was supposed to possess, but no mention was ever made of the huge
debts. In 1760, after a courtship of over two years Donna Anna
consented to marry Cavalier Domenico bringing with her a dowry
of over <B>80,000 Maltese Scudi.</B>
<!-- (Equivalent to approximately Lm ..0,000 nowadays)-->
<P>
<IMG SRC="betty2.gif" align=right></A>Donna Anna was persuaded
by her husband that, for a short while, it was expedient for them
to live with his father at Reggio until the Messina residence
was got ready.  On arriving at Reggio, however, the newly wedded
bride saw for herself the true state of her husband's family fortune.
The newly married couple suffered continuous importunities from
the family creditors and at one time the bride had to pawn her
own jewellery; one day Cavalier Parisio even asked his wife to
return the few pieces of jewellery which he had given her as a
wedding present as these had been borrowed and were being reclaimed
by their rightful owners.

<P>
The damage was beyond repair as the marriage could not be dissolved,
and when Donna Anna complained to her husband he excused himself
by saying that even he had been unaware of the deplorable state

<FONT SIZE=6><B>T</B></FONT>he climate of Reggio seriously affected Donna Anna's health
and on three occasions she was forced to return to Malta - on
her third visit in 1774 she was prohibited by her physicians from
returning to her husband's native land.
<P>
In February 1783 Calabria, including the city of Reggio, was scourged
by a terrible earthquake. Donna Anna had then been living in Malta
for eleven years and although five children were born of the marriage
she had only one of them under her care, the youngest, Paolo,
who had been ,born in Malta, and of whom. more will be heard anon;
the other four were living with their father at Reggio. One can
therefore well imagine Donna Anna's anxiety for the safety of<B>
</B>her family.
<P>
As the galleys of the Order were being sent to succour Messina
and Reggio, Donna Anna took the opportunity of sending by Chevalier
Sanpris, Captain of one of the galleys, a sum of money sufficient
to meet any needs. Parisio accepted the money and sent the four
childen living with him to their mother who welcomed them warmly.
The children, however, had no other end in view than to return
to Reggio laden with money and presents.  They behaved so badly
to their mother and to their grandfather, the old Don Paolo Muscati,
that Donna Anna made no opposition when three of them expressed
the desire of returning to their father in Reggio.
<P>
On the morning of Monday, 27 October 1783, Comm. Don Giacinto
Parisio, brother of Don Domenico, called at the house in Merchants
Street and wanted his nephews and nieces, Giovanni, Maria, Gaetana
and Francesco to return; with him to Reggio. Immediately Donna
Anna informed him that Gaetana was ill and in no fit state to
travel, but, in spite of this, Don Giacinto violently seized Gaetana
and dragged her to a waiting coach. This commotion took place
in the street outside the house, a crowd composed of all sorts
of people having gathered surprised at such goings on.
<P>
Donna Anna rushed to <A HREF="rohan2.jpg"><B>Grand Master de Rohan</B></A>
 to implore his protection.
 The Grand Master sent for the Castellan, Commander de Neveu,
and ordered him to issue a warrant of impediment of departure
on two sailing vessels which were about to set sail.  This warrant
was to remain in force until the young Parisios decided whether
they wished to remain In Malta or return to Reggio.  Gaetana elected
to remain in Malta and live with her mother; the sailing, vessels
were then allowed to proceed with the remaining three Parisios
on board.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=6><B>I</B></FONT>n 1798 we find Palazzo Parisio the property of Chev. Paolo
Parisio Muscati, the youngest son of Donna Anna, who had been,
created a Knight of Devotion by Grand Master Ferdinand Von Hompesch.

<h1>DCRS general</h1>
<B>Remote sensing and Earth science.</B> The Earth constitutes
a very complex system with atmosphere, ocean, ice, and land constantly
interacting, exchanging energy and water. A new concept "Earth
System Science" has evolved to advance the understanding
of our planet, its elements, and especially their interaction.
In addition to understanding the natural behaviour and changes
of our planet, a major benefit from such research is an improvement
in our ability to predict the environmental impact of human activity.
A key to understanding our planet is accurate observations and
modelling of the crucial interacting processes.
<P>
<B>Centre objective.</B> The objective of DCRS is to integrate
technological R&amp;D in the areas of remote sensing sensors,
data processing, interpretation, and visualisation, with Earth
science studies. DCRS is continuing the sensor R&amp;D activities
at EMI, however, with focus on advancing observational techniques
of importance for Earth observations and science. DCRS is conducting
science experiments and data collection campaigns to provide original
experimental data for the research of DCRS scientists and DCRS
partners. The research at DCRS includes electromagnetics and geophysics
modelling.

SAR repeat-track-interferometry applied to Storstrmmen Glacier,
Northeast Greenland; The ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica
act as long-term reservoirs in the hydrological cycle, and changes
in their size are therefore an indicator of global climate change.
Although glaciers are a much smaller part of the cryosphere, they
are considered an important diagnostics tool as they respond more
rapidly to changing environmental conditions. This is a study
of the capability of SAR repeat track interferometry (RTI) using
multiple baseline techniques to provide spatial measurements of
instantaneous ice velocity and also micro topography of importance
for future measurements of changes of surface elevations and velocities
of glaciers. DCRS is the PI on an ERS-1/-2 investigation
on applying interferometric SAR satellite techniques to glacier
dynamics studies.

Sea ice affects the climate as sea ice extent and type are important
parameters in determining the transport of heat and humidity from
the ocean to the atmosphere. Data from active and passive microwave
sensors contain information about sea ice that is not available
from other sources. In order to make better use of microwave remote
sensing techniques for monitoring sea ice conditions, it is necessary
to have detailed information about microwave signatures of major
types of sea ice.


<center><h2>Sea Ice observations</h2></center>

DCRS takes part in a number of national and International projects where remote sensing
in general and microwave remote sensing in particular is used as a tool for monitoring
sea ice.

<b>Figure caption</b>
<p>
C-band polarimetric image of 'S&oslash;dalen' at Kangerdlugssuaq (68 N, 32 W) . The intensities of the HV, HH, and VV channels are coded in red, green and blue, respectively. From the glacier in the lower left corner the melt water passes a small lake (Danish: s&oslash;) in the valley (Danish: dalen) before it falls into the Mikis fjord, at the head of which a moraine forms a crescent. To the left of the lake is one of the many faults seen in the area. To the right of the moraine is a 880 m high mountain with concentric contours reflecting the lava bedding. The terrain elevation impacts both the geometry (foreshortening) and the radiometry (bright mountain sides facing the SAR and shadows on the opposite sides). It is believed that the artifact seen as strong yellow and magenta colors behind the sharp mountain rims is due to multiple reflections in the mountain sides.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<b>Objective</b>
<p>
DLC is studying the
relations between terrain morphology, geologic structures, and
the physical properties of mountain complexes in West Greenland.
DCRS will investigate if interferometric SAR techniques can be
applied to generate topographic maps in the 200 by 200 km
western study area. DCRS will utilise satellite systems (ERS-1/2)
to generate regional size topographical maps at moderate resolution
and the airborne SAR will acquire data to generate local, high
resolution topographic maps. Experiments in East Greenland will
study the application of multi-frequency synthetic aperture radar
techniques including polarimetry to geologic mapping, classification
of the regolith, and mapping of the surface topography in a 400 km
long and relatively narrow area in East Greenland. This study
is the subject of an ERS-1/-2 investigation with DCRS
as PI.
<p>
<b>1994 experiment</b>
<p>
25 by 25 km test site at Kangerdlugssuaq  (68 N, 32 W) was mapped with DCRS's
airborne SAR, EMISAR. Kangerdlugssuaq is located 500 km south west
of Scoresbysund, East Greenland. Fully polarimetric C-band data was
acquired and subsequently processed to 2 by 2 m resolution, one-look
imagery. In rough terrains the internal structures of lithologies
are masked by the topography, while in more gentle areas they are
weathered out and reflected in the SAR images. Here, major structural
elements of gneisses show up quite well, as do faults, dikes, and
bedding in lava successions. However, a lithological classification
cannot be based on the C-band data, because the SAR is sensitive to
the surface morphology, and gneiss and gabbro, for instance, have
similar morphologies due to the glacial smoothing.
<p>
<b>1995 experiment</b>
<p>
This year the polarimetric data was acquired at L-band. Since SARs are
sensitive to features with a size comparable to the wavelength used,
morphologic differences not reflected in the C-band data might show up
in the L-band data. The extreme topography in the Kangerdlugssuaq area
is a major obstacle for the geologic interpretation of the SAR imagery.
Therefore the 1995 test site was extended to a 100 km long strip from
Kangerdlugssuaq to Watkins Bjerge where areas with more gentle
topography are found. For the same reason, EMISAR collected cross-track
interferomety (XTI) data as well. The digital elevtion model to be
generated from these XTI data will allow the SAR imagery to be
geometrically and radiometrically corrected for the topography.

He was responsible for the development of a dedicated onboard full resolution real-time processor for EMISAR, and prior to that he implemented software processors for the SEASAT SAR and EMISAR systems. Other SAR activities have included development of a novel SAR autofocus algorithm, and studies of fast transform and convolution algorithms for SAR processing. He is now leading the SAR processing group at the Danish Center for Remote Sensing (DCRS).

An important property of the Earth's
surface is the friction it exerts on atmospheric circulation.
For a given wind it determines the extent of soil removal, loss
of nutrients and seeds from fields, sediment transport in dunes,
dust generation and subsequently desertification by drifting sand.
Aerodynamic roughness is known to be correlated with the textural
properties of the ground -surface roughness- that can
be measured by radar polarimetry. Sediment transport, i.e. the
flux of material per unit width per unit time, is practically
impossible to measure accurately by conventional techniques in
complex dune fields. This study concern the use of interferometric
SAR techniques to derive detailed topographical information for
the Rbjerg Mile dune field at the required vertical resolution.
An important attribute is that radar is weather-independent and
the data processing very efficient. DCRS is the PI on an ERS-1/-2
investigation on applying interferometric SAR satellite techniques
to both this area and a larger dune field in southern California.

The aerodynamic roughness is
an important parameter when modelling vertical transport of heat,
water vapour, and mass since areas with large aerodynamic roughness
will create more turbulence and thereby vertical transport. This
work aims at investigating the use of SAR techniques to determine
aerodynamic roughness from aircraft or satellites, particularly
in vegetated areas.

This research concerns
the application of radar remote sensing techniques to monitor
agricultural crops, biomass, and soil physics. The observational
techniques includes SAR polarimetry and interferometry, as well
as low frequency radiometry to measure soil moisture content.
The applicability of these observational techniques to research
on crop micro meteorology, hydrology, and forestry will also be
investigated. A key component of this study is multi temporal
data collection near RCF. RCF includes 700 ha of intensively monitored
farm land which is an ideal test site for the application of remote
sensing to agriculture. Even larger areas at the neighbouring
Tjele Estate, is also well mapped and closely monitored.

The DANMAC project is a collaboration between a number of Danish
institutions: Danish Institute of Plant and Soil Science (DIPSS),
National Environmental Research Institute (<a href="http://www.dmu.dk">NERI</a>),
Institute of Geography at University of Copenhagen (IGUC),
Danish Information Network in the Agricultural Sciences
(<a href="http://www.dina.kvl.dk">Dina</a>) at the Royal Veterinary
and Agricultural University,
Department of Meteorology and Wind Energy at 
Ris National Laboratory (<a href="http://www.risoe.dk/risoe.html">Ris</a>),
Danish Forest and Landscape Research Institute, and
Institute of Mathematical Modelling
(<a href="http://www.imm.dtu.dk/homepage.html">IMM</a>) 
at Technical University of Denmark (<a href="http://www.dtu.dk/dtu/dtu.html">DTU</a>).
<p>
The purpose of the project is to achieve a better understanding
of the physical conditions and processes at the surface influencing the signal
of both optical and radar sensors. The DANMAC project is a multisensor and
multidisciplinary remote sensing campaign, consisting of four test sites
covering one for agriculture/forestry, two for landscape-ecology/natural type
and one for inland waters (lakes). For each test site extensive ground data
collection takes place together with simultaneous data acquisition by airborne
and spaceborne SAR's and/or optical/infrared sensors. Following the data
collection, data processing, modelling and interpretation take place at the
collaborating institutes in a coordinated effort.

<p>
DCRS is collaborating with the DANMAC-group by undertaking acquisitions by the polarimetric
EMISAR, and by data processing and interpretation as well as microwave modelling.
DCRS also participates in the in-situ data collection. 
The work carried out in the DANMAC-group is closely related to other DCRS
projects: <a href="roughness.html">Aerodynamic Roughness</a>,
<a href="soilMapping.html">Plant and Soil Mapping</a>, and

<FONT SIZE=2>The European Multi-sensor Airborne Campaign (EMAC-94/95)
is a programme providing support for the preparation of future
satellite remote sensing programmes and their users.</FONT> 
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The EMAC-95 campaign concentrated on snow and ice
experiments in northern Europe. In addition, the EMAC-94 flights
associated with the NOrthern hemisphere climate Processes land-surface
Experiment (NOPEX) at Uppsala, Sweden, were continued.</FONT>
<P>
<B>EMISAR Deployment in the EMAC-95 Campaign</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Four airborne sensors were used in 1995, viz. the
<A HREF="http://www.dcrs.dtu.dk/DCRS/emisar.html">EMISAR</A> and
ESAR imaging radars, and the HUT and UKMO microwave radiometers.
On campaigns in March, May, and July EMISAR collected fully polarimetric
L- and C- band data from the three ice and snow sites as well
as the NOPEX site; a total of 46 polarimetric scenes. The data
collection was carried out as planned.</FONT> 
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The EMISAR calibration procedure relies on an internal
calibration system which greatly relieves the dependence on external
calibration targets. For the calibration verification and long
term stability the internal calibration is complemented by corrections
derived from external calibration experiments. Therefore, on each
of the three campaigns the Danish calibration site at Foulum was
mapped at both L-band and C-band. The corrections to the internal
calibration are small and very similar from mission to mission.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>An analysis of the internal calibration data has
proven that the EMISAR stability during mapping is fully satisfactory.
Also, an analysis of the focused and calibrated Foulum scenes
has confirmed that the map to map calibration stability is actually
sufficient for using just a single external calibration per mission.
As a matter of fact, the results indicate that external calibration
is barely necessary on every mission, however, it is still desired
as a means to confirm the expected calibration performance.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The raw data have been focused and a polarimetric
calibration has been applied. The deliverables include Exabyte
tapes with two data products: 1) the full resolution scattering
matrix data in the slant range projection and 2) the multi-looked
covariance matrix data in the pseudo ground range projection.
'Pseudo' refers to the fact that the projection has not taken
into account the terrain elevation.</FONT> 
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>All March and July data were delivered mid November,
1995, and the May data were delivered in the period February to
June 1996. To begin with the delivery was tentatively scheduled
for October 1, but the processing was delayed by 1) run-in of
the L-band system which had only been flown twice prior to the
EMAC-95 campaigns, 2) introduction of the covariance matrix format,
and 3) multiple HDDT recorder break downs. Additionally, the processing
of the May data was delayed by the fact that the HDDT tapes used
in May turned out to be bad, although certified by Ampex. Finally,
the processing of two scenes delivered in June was postponed because
it was not clear if they should be processed at all. The two scenes
are from the Finnish Ice site, but they did virtually not cover
any ice.</FONT>

The SAR research is based on the state-of-the-art C-band fully
polarimetric SAR developed at EMI with support from the EU's Joint
Research Centre, operated on a Danish Air Force Gulfstream G-3
aircraft. A longer wavelength L-band system was tested
early 1995. The technology program includes processing,
calibration, analysis and tools for analysing polarimetric SAR
data including polarisation signatures, calculating optimal polarimetric
classifiers, performing polarimetric decomposition, map transformations
etc. This activity also includes maintenance of the polarimetric
SAR system, tests, engineering and calibration flights, and verification
of the overall sensor system and data quality.

During 1995 the SAR has been upgraded to include interferometric
modes, which enables 3-dimensional data collection and measurement
on velocity fields. The polarimetric SAR installation on the G-3
has been augmented with additional C-band flush mounted antennas
displaced cross track. A state-of-the-art navigation and attitude
systems (tightly coupled INU/GPS) is integrated to provide
accurate measurements of aircraft motion and attitude. Also, a
unique capability has been developed that allows the radar to
steer the aircraft based on real-time GPS positions and velocities
thus providing the capability to accurately design the track geometry
for repeat track interferometry.

Today, imaging spaceborne radiometers feature a mechanical scanning
of the antenna. As demands to ground resolution become more severe
large apertures are needed and mechanical scan is impractical.
The Synthetic Aperture Interferometric Radiometer (SAIR) system
is a possible<I> </I>configuration to solve this problem. SAIR
is an instrument which, without scanning, is able to measure complete
images with high resolution. A compromise between high resolution
and side lobe level can be made in signal processing and is no
longer a parameter which is to be chosen while designing the antenna.
<P>
A laboratory instrument has been designed and built to investigate
the SAIR concept. X-band horns can be placed anywhere within a
certain aperture and the output signals from the associated radiometers
are crosscorrelated to yield points of the visibility function.
A multichannel radio camera is simulated by sequential measurements.
A test scene with good radiometric contrast consisting of metal
letters (EMI) with an absorbing background, has been measured,
and an image has been successfully reconstructed. Based on the
above a new Ku band radiometer has been built with emphasis on
stability and calibration precision. In the near future this will
be used in experiments related to the calibration of SAIR instruments.
<P>
Development of a proper L-band (1.4 GHz) radio camera MIRAS has
commenced under an ESA contract with MATRA as the prime contractor.
Eleven antenna elements (with a similar number of radiometers)
are placed on a Y-formed structure with an arm length of approximately
60 cm. The instrument is to be flown on a C-130 aircraft from
the Danish Air Force and can be used for measurement of soil moisture.
Under this project, work with optimal algorithms for signal processing
of data measured with the Ku-band SAIR demonstration model is
carried out. Signal processing comprises work with irregular sampled
spatial frequencies, interpolation, inverse Fourier transformation,
and coordinate transformation. Data from objects placed in the
 near field as well as in the far field of the synthetic aperture
can be processed with suitably chosen transformations.

 <h1>New Sensor Developments</h1>
</center>

<P>
<b>DCRS contact</b>: <a href="/DCRS/staff/snm.html">Sren Nrvang Madsen</a>, e-mail: <a href="mailto:snm@emi.dtu.dk">snm@emi.dtu.dk</a> and
<a href="/DCRS/staff/ns.html">Niels Skou</a>, e-mail: <a href="mailto:ns@emi.dtu.dk">ns@emi.dtu.dk</a><br>
<p>
In addition to these activities DCRS undertakes studies addressing
the measurement capabilities, scientific potential, and technical
feasibility of novel remote sensing concepts. These activities
will include active and passive sensors and frequency bands other
than microwaves. The centre plans to take part in the development
of at least two new sensors over the coming years. An interferometric
low frequency (L-band) radiometer MIRAS is presently being developed
in co-operation with Matra/France with funding from ESA. The DCRS
activities include test data collections with the system, development
of processing algorithms, and evaluation of the performance and
utility of the system.
<P>
A candidate for a second new sensor is The Scanning Microwave
Radar &amp; Radiometer (SMRR), which is a line scanner featuring
a combined radar and radiometer system operating around 19, 37,
and 90 GHz. The key word is synergism - in this case trying to
use both active and passive measurements to obtain information
not otherwise available using either one of these alone. This
has been done before using separate radars and radiometers, but
always hampered by lack of simultaneousness and lack of identical
footprints. The 2 offset antenna parabolas scan in syncronism,
the receiver antenna has the higest gain in order to ensure that
footprints are identical for the radar and the radiometer. The
instrument will be flown in a pod under a Gulfstream G3 able to
cruise at 45000 ft, and will thus be able to sense clouds and
precipitation from above. Also, it will be used for other geophysical
measurements like sea ice classification from suitable flight
altitudes.
<P>
Other candidates under consideration include polarimetric radiometers
and high resolution, high frequency SARs.

<p>
An important part of the technological program is the development
of efficient computer tools to process, evaluate, visualise, and
archive data from DCRS' own sensors but also from existing
and planned remote sensing satellites. This library of tools to
utilise data will include software to combine data acquired by
different sensors, to visualise data sets with many independent
channels, and to transform data between different map projections.
Processing and scientific analysis of the data collected by the
developed sensors will require significant expansions of computational
capabilities. The activities at DCRS includes studies on utilising
parallel computers. This activity will also support DCRS'
principal investigator (PI) studies on scientific applications
of data from the SAR on board the European Remote Sensing satellites,
ERS-1/-2.

<h2><center>European Subpolar Ocean Project under MAST-II</center></h2>

<h2>Overall project description</h2>

The European Subpolar Ocean Project (ESOP) has the overall objective of understanding the role played by sea ice in the energetics of the Greenland Sea system as a whole, and in the specific ice-ocean interactions involved in the process of deep convection in the winter in the Greenland Sea with its attendant sequestration of carbon dioxide. Work began in July 1993, and will continue for three years, with  <a href="/DCRS/esop.email.html">22 participating principal investigators </a>from 7 countries of or associated with the European Union (Denmark, France, Germany, Great Britain, Iceland, Norway, Sweden). The project is funded by the Commission of the European Union under the Marine Science and Technology Programme (MAST-II), contract no. MAS2-CT93-0057. 


<h2>Role and contribution of TUD (DCRS)</h2>

<h3>Ice formation and decay in the Odden area</h3>
High resolution (30-100 meters) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data will be used to study the small scale formation and decay of ice in the Odden area. The images will be classified into various types of ice based on the statistics (texture) of pixel values inside regions.
The ice motion field will primarily be derived from thermal infrared and near infrared images from the NOAA AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer, 1 kilometre resolution) during cloud-free periods. These observations will be supplemented by observations made with SAR data when the area is cloud covered and/or where the very high resolution is necessary in order to distinguish individual features.
A report on the Odden/Bay area of the 1993 winter is available on-line. It includes a large number of ERS-1 SAR and ssm/i passive microwave images of the Greenland Sea.

These data have a spatial resolution of 10-30 kilometres and thus allow only large-scale studies. However, the swath of the sensor is almost 1400 kilometres allowing observations of the Odden region 2-4 times every 24 hours. The data can be used to derive ice concentrations and potentially distinguish between a few ice types. However, absolute calibration is a problem and requires an independent set of observations. It is the intention to use the ice information derived from the SAR data and AVHRR (VALEUR) to perform this calibration. The passive microwave data will be used to provide operational ice maps in collaboration with VALEUR if the data becomes available in near real-time

<h3>Sea ice signatures</h3>

In order to further understand the microwave signatures from various ice types it is proposed to carry out a field experiment in conjunction with the winter 1993 cruise by Polarstern. A trained ice observer will be on board the ship to collect samples of ice and snow whenever the ship is stationary (collecting oceanographic data). Also, an aircraft equipped with instruments similar to the satellite instruments will be operated. The aircraft instruments will have a much better spatial resolution (50-200 meters) than the satellite instruments, allowing a more detailed comparison of passive microwave data, SAR data and surface observations. 

<h3>Historical perspective</h3>

A large historical record of satellite-based passive microwave observations exists, dating back to 1973. It is proposed to analyze this dataset in order to obtain a basis for evaluating the data collected during the one-year field experiment in 1993. The analysis will be performed using established methods (Pedersen, 1991) for calibrating the derived ice concentrations based on areas of stable ice conditions and additional visible and infrared high resolution imagery from cloud-free periods.<p>

<center><h1>Project for Estimation of Long-term variability in Ice CONcentration </h1></center>

<h3>Detailed description of the contribution of DCRS</h3>
<p>

The analysis of multispectral passive microwave observations in order to derive sea ice related parameters such as ice concentration and ice type requires both regional and seasonal calibration of the algorithms applied (Pedersen, 1991). The purpose of the proposed project is to establish methods for performing this calibration using visible and infrared images from NOAA, LANDSAT and SPOT satellites. In particular, the effect of variability in weather effects and surface conditions on PMI ice concentration estimates will be addressed.

<h1> Microwave radiometer signatures of sea ice</h1>

<h3>Purpose</h3> 
It is the purpose of this project to improve the accuracy of sea-ice concentrations derived from satellite microwave radiometer systems. This will be attempted by using data from similar and other passive and active microwave instruments. In particular, data from the synthetic aperture radar on ERS-1 will be exploited as well as ground measurements. Thus, the project will demonstrate the complementarity of microwave data from active high resolution sensors with small areal coverage and coarse resolution data from passive sensors with large areal coverage. 
In this context, it is also the aim to obtain an improved understanding of the passive microwave signatures of sea ice and their regional and seasonal variability.

<h3>Background</h3>
The surface of the Earth emits thermal microwave radiation. The amount of radiation and its spectral composition varies from one type of surface to another. In  particular, the emission from the open ocean and from sea ice are very different resulting in a large signature contrast between ice and water. Microwaves are only to a minor degree absorbed (attenuated) by the atmosphere and thus provides excellent means for observing variations in ice cover independent of clouds. Also, since the thermal radiation is emitted independently of daylight, observations may be carried out 24 hours per day.
<p>
The European Space Agency, ESA, is developing a microwave radiometer (MIMR, Multifrequency Imaging Microwave Radiometer) to be deployed with the Polar Platforms from 1998. One of the main objectives of the instrument is according to the MIMR-instrument panel report [ESA SP-1138, 1990] to provide observations of ice cover for climatological purposes.
<p>
Such types of observations have been carried out since the early 1970s from various American satellites (NIMBUS-5, NIMBUS-6, NIMBUS-7 and at present DMSP) and an almost complete record covering a 20-year period is available, in some parts with daily observations.
NIMBUS-5 and NIMBUS-6 only observed the radiation at one wavelength, but with the NIMBUS-7 SMMR instrument (1978-1987) and the present SSM/I instrument on the DMSP satellites (1987 and onwards) multispectral observations are recorded. This allows corrections for a number of error sources so that an accuracy of ice concentrations derived from these data sets is in the order of 5-8%.
<p>
Various studies, primarily at NASA, have demonstrated the usefulness of these data for large scale analyses, including the compilation of atlases showing the many years of ice cover [Parkinson & Cavalieri, 1989; Parkinson et al., 1987]. Based on these it was investigated whether a trend in the total ice cover in the two hemispheres during the last 20 years could be observed. However, it was concluded that no global change could be observed within the measurement accuracy, whereas regionally certain areas showed an increase in ice cover and other areas a decrease. 
<p>
It may be concluded that a number of important potential applications of the microwave radiometer data still awaits better accuracy of the ice concentrations derived from these data, and that this is essential if data from the future European MIMR instrument is going to be useful for for example climate studies of the total ice cover on the Earth and for studies of the exchange of heat between the atmosphere and the ocean in ice-frequented regions. Since the heat loss to the atmosphere from ice and from the open ocean differs by a factor of 100, it is important to know the ice concentrations with great accuracy for the purpose of numerical modelling, in particular at large concentrations. It is suggested that the accuracy should be better than 2-3%  on a yearly basis.
<p>
The algorithms being used to derive ice concentrations from multispectral observations require calibration in the form of reference observations from areas with "pure surface types", i.e. areas consisting of one surface type only. Such areas of 100% open (ice-free) ocean can easily be found for example in the Norwegian Sea. However, extensive areas of 100% first-year ice or 100% multi-year ice are difficult to find near the Greenland Sea. Instead, observations from a number of areas with different ice/water mixtures are used and the ice concentrations are determined from visible and infrared images or from in situ observations. However, visible and infrared observations can only be used under clear sky conditions (no clouds) so that these references are only available (useful) under certain atmospheric conditions.
<p>
The state-of-the art was reviewed by the Sea Ice Group of scientists attending the ESA Microwave Workshop at San Miniato, Italy, 19-21 September 1990 and recent investigations [Garrity, 1991, Pedersen, 1991, Steffen and Schweiger, 1991, Cavalieri et al. 1991, Burns, 1992] have documented that a very important source of error when deriving ice concentrations from microwave radiometer data is the variation of the emissivity of the ice/snow surface. The algorithms require knowledge of the emissivity of the ice/snow- and the ocean surface and  presently such knowledge originates only from in situ observations taken during occasional field campaigns. Such campaigns are expensive and the number of observations is therefore relatively small.
<p>
The properties of the sea surface are reasonably well known and models giving the emissivity at various wavelengths and polarizations as a function of temperature, wind speed (surface roughness) and salinity exist. However, the situation with respect to the ice is somewhat different. We distinguish between several different types of ice with different emissivities. Existing numerical models [Lee and Kong 1985a and b] are micro-scale models that need modifications in order to be related to the macro-scale applications in question taking into account parameters such as ice-type, temperature, snow cover, roughness, salinity etc. Considering the complexity of the situation only two ice types are normally considered, first-year ice and multiyear ice, with assigned emissivities supposedly valid during the entire year and with no regional variations. Neglecting seasonal and regional variations leads to errors. As an example, the signature of multiyear ice in the Canadian Basin of the Arctic Ocean is quite different from the emissivity of multiyear ice in the Fram Strait and the East Greenland Current. Also, these signatures vary along the Greenland eastcoast due to the varying temperature and precipitation conditions from 80N to 60N [Cavalieri et al., 1991, Pedersen, 1991].
<p>
In order to improve the accuracy of radiometer-based ice concentrations it is therefore necessary to map the seasonal and regional variations in the emissivity of all relevant ice types (including various types of new ice during ice formation) and to use site and season-specific signatures as reference values (tie-points) in the algorithms.
In a number of investigations [Garrity, 1991, Maetzler, Ramseier & Svendsen 1984] variability in surface snow layer(s) is found to be a major contributor to the emissivity variations, in particular at horizontal polarization. Thus, ways to obtain information about surface snow properties should be established. Such information could be obtained by analyzing time sequences of data and incorporating meteorological observations (through a data assimilation model) about temperature variations (melt-freeze cycles) and precipitation.

<h3>Methods</h3>
It is proposed to map the variations in ice conditions by means of simultaneous passive and active microwave data. The main instruments will be the SMM/I microwave radiometer on DMSP satellites and the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) on ERS-1.  The SAR allows a very detailed observation of the ice canopy in confined areas compared to that of the passive instrument, and thus provides an excellent complement to the coarse-resolution radiometer data that provides for large areal coverage. 
The SMM/I radiometer has a spatial resolution of 25 km and a swath of approximately 1400 km whereas the SAR scenes reveal 30 meter resolution (in some instances also 140-meter data may be obtained) but in a swath of only 100 km. Thus, a single SAR scene provides a maximum of 16 independent areas to be used for calibration of the radiometer-based ice concentrations and ice types.
<p>
SAR data from different seasons and regions in the Greenland and adjacent seas will be collected and analyzed in order to determine the concentrations of various ice types within the field of view of the microwave radiometer. The radiometer data will be analyzed with the aim of estimating emissivities for the areas covered by the SAR scenes. Data from a number of test cases throughout the year will be analyzed in order to map the seasonal variations. The regional variability will be addressed by using (at each time) a number of scenes reaching from the Fram Strait (81N) to Denmark Strait (65N). Also, it is important to repeat the analysis for more than one year in order to cover interannual variability.
<p>
It must be realized that the use of SAR data is not without problems. The derivation of sea ice concentrations from SAR data is far from trivial, and also requires validation. Thus, it is  important that simultaneous efforts be carried out in order to validate the SAR retrievals. It is the intention to perform this validation using in situ data during the field campaigns, and using visible and infrared satellite imagery under cloud-free conditions.
<p>
The two datasets will be compared in order to map the spectral passive microwave signatures of various ice types. The accuracy in ice concentrations resulting from the synergistic use of both datasets will be further improved using data from other instruments in the visible and infrared parts of the electromagnetic spectrum (AVHRR, ATSR, Landsat, SPOT).  The various data types complement each other, and a synergistic approach is necessary.
The interannual variations will be determined by performing the investigations for a period of three years but with a lower intensity during the last two years. 
<p>
Additional questions related to the signature variations will be investigated during a number of field campaigns in the Greenland Sea and eventually other areas of the Arctic. For these campaigns an airborne and/or ship-mounted microwave radiometer system will be used, preferably in a profiling mode with scaled antenna horns in order to obtain the same spatial resolution at all wavelengths. A system developed at the Electromagnetics Institute [Skou, 1978] will be used supplemented with equipment supplied by other participants. These radiometers may need some modification in order to fit into a smaller aircraft. It is expected that  a single field campaign will have a duration of several days, and that several campaigns will be needed every year in order to monitor both short-term and long-term variations. 
<p>
In order to understand the relationship between the physical ice parameters and the microwave data some of the airborne missions will be planned to coincide with field campaigns in connection with ship opportunities. During these the following parameters will be measured: snow depth, density stratification and humidity, ice salinity profiles, ice temperature profiles etc. [Cavalieri et al., 1991] along with microwave radiances measured from satellite and/or aircraft. Radiative transfer models published in the literature will be exploited to further substantiate the measurements. Observations of surface as well as uppper-air meteorological parameters will be carried out in order to correct  the observations for variations in the amount of atmospheric radiation and in order to relate variations in emissivities to past and present weather situations.

<h3>Data</h3>
Microwave radiometer data from the SSM/I instrument is distributed on CD-ROM by the World Data Centre to a number of interested institutions including the Electromagnetics Institute. The data are organized in a polar stereographic grid as the average value of 24 hours of observations. A single CD-ROM contains approximately 3 months of observations at 4 different wavelengths (0.3 to 1.5 cm). These averaged data will be supplemented by a number of CCT's containing the original orbits recorded at the time of the SAR-scene acquisitions. These data may be obtained through EARTHNET.
<p>
A number of scenes from the SAR on ERS-1 will have to be acquired in order to carry out the proposed activity. The Electromagnetics Institute is recognized by ESA as a Principal Investigator for ERS-1 with special emphasis on sea ice applications, and is a member of PIPOR (Programme for International Polar Oceans Research). Thus, the majority of the SAR-scenes necessary is expected to be available free of charge through this approved activity. 
<p>
As a supplement to the microwave data, Landsat and SPOT data in photographic form will be purchased. These data having a spatial resolution of the same order as the SAR data are intended for verification of the ice parameters. The verification will be qualitative rather than quantitative and thus photographic reproductions will probably suffice.

<h3>Experiences</h3>
This project was initially proposed as a Danish project and has already obtained funds for the initial phase of one year from the Danish Space Research Board. However, it was suggested from several sides that it would be useful as a basis for international cooperation, and that in fact it is already so, since it depends to a great extent on contributions in the form of field campaigns. Also, additional financial support will be required in order that a sufficient number of airborne campaigns may be carried out. The project has therefore been proposed to colleagues for possible participation in various ways.
<p>
The project initiated at the Electromagnetics Institute is based on the experience obtained during several years in analyzing passive microwave radiometer data acquired from satellites [Pedersen, 1991]. Also, experience in processing and analyzing SAR data for ice parameter retrieval is present at the Electromagnetics Institute [Skriver, 1989] and will be developed further in connection with the Greenland Sea Project (GSP) funded by the Danish Space Research Board for 1992 and 1993.

<h3>Schedule and work statements</h3>
The investigations proposed will be carried out from 1992 and onwards. A preliminary schedule is as follows:
<dl>
  <dt>	<strong>1992.</strong> Analysis of SSM/I and ERS-1 SAR data will be carried out. The former data will be treated on an annual basis. In particular, the analysis of SAR scenes will have to be developed to fit to the data and their specific application. In addition, preparation for airborne and field campaigns including modification of microwave radiometer equipment will be made.
	An introductory field campaign will be attempted in connection with the cruise of the American icebreaker "Polar Sea" to North East Water (at about 82N, 12W) and the Kanumas seismic investigations from a ship of the continental shelf of Greenland (70N to 80N) both planned for the period July-August. In this period an intensive acquisition of SAR data is needed in the area and in Fram Strait. Underflights with the Danish airborne SAR at the same frequency and polarizations as that of ERS-1will be included if at all possible. With its 2-meter spatial resolution it will supply very detailed data of the area investigated.
  <dt>		<strong>1993</strong>. The analysis of SSM/I and ERS-1 SAR data will be continued. The data will be related to the overall observation of the Greenland Sea with complementary satellite instruments, including AVHRR data. Also, algorithms will be developed that exploit available satellite data in a synergistic way including oceanographic and especially meteorological data. A pilot field campaign will be carried out in cooperation between the DMI and EMI/DCRS using TUD radiometers. The campaign will test the radiometer installation in a Twin-Otter aircraft ot the DMI/Greenlandair with profiling antennas. Tha campaign will be carried out off the West Greenland coast. 	
  <dt>		<strong>1994.</strong> The analysis of data will continue to the extent that ERS-1 SAR data become available. Airborne campaigns will be organized as in the previous year. Opportunities of field campaigns will be exploited. A field campaign in the Greenland Sea will be carried out with TUD radiometers and DMI aircraft. 
  <dt>		<strong>1995.</strong> The analysis of data will continue to the extent that ERS-1 SAR data become available. Airborne campaigns will be organized as in the previous year. Opportunities of field campaigns will be exploited. A field campaign in the Greenland Sea will be carried out with TUD radiometers and DMI aircraft as well as a Royal Danish Airforce Gulfstream G3 equipped with the DCRS polarimetric C-band SAR.

<h3>Additional information</h3>
Three factors play an important role in the accuracy and precision of quantitative sea ice observations using microwave radiometry:
<dl>
<dt>	-	Tie point variability
	<dt>	-	Geophysical noise
<dt>		-	Measurement noise
</dl>
Tie point variability is the most serious limitation to the success of microwave radiometer observations of sea ice. The signature of a given type of ice varies regionally and seasonally to an extent that may cause errors in retrieved ice concentration of at least 10% and make the distinction between old and new ice during major parts of the year impossible. The way to remedy this situation is to obtain knowledge about the variability. Today the variability is not well understood and thus laboratory and field experiments that expand our knowledge about the relation between the variability in ice conditions and the resulting microwave signatures should be carried out. However, prior to such undertakings, additional knowledge should be obtained by combining data from SAR, fine-resolution visible and infrared images (Landsat & SPOT) and passive microwave observations. Such a study, with the aim of mapping the regional and seasonal variability of the ice signatures, will provide a good basis for further field and laboratory experiments, i.e. for defining areas and seasons of specific interest.
Geophysical noise means errors in the retrieved ice parameters due to variations in other geophysical parameters not or insufficiently accounted for in the retrieval algorithm. Cloud liquid water, atmospheric columnar water vapour, ice temperature and wind roughening of the  open ocean are the prime contributors to the geophysical noise. Therefore,  priori knowledge about their variability or even better additional observations of their magnitude should be incorporated into future algorithms for ice parameter retrieval. Such knowledge is  to some extent available from meteorological analysis models that produce gridded fields of the above mentioned parameters every 6 hours. Algorithms to combine observations from a variety of sources should be developed and refined.
<p>
Measurement noise is with the present state of microwave radiometers no problem for ice parameter retrieval. However, the long-term stability of instruments and instrument malfunction or miscalibration are of great importance and it is desirable that programmes be carried out to establish absolute calibration of spaceborne microwave radiometers while in space. The contribution to noise in daily averaged data will be evaluated. Repeated measurements of brightness temperatures of the stable central ice of Greenland may serve as a control of instrument stability.

Standard deviation of (uncertainty in) ice concentration as a result of variability in ice/snow surface emissivity. The Full and the dashed curves correspond to a situation with approx. 90% ice cover, and the two other curves to approx. 10% ice cover. The upper curve in each case corresponds to using 37 GHz. data only (both polarizations) in the retrieval, whereas the lower curve corresponds to using the 18 and 37 GHz. vertically polarized channels. Results obtained from applying estimation theory to the ice parameter retrieval problem [Pedersen, 1991]. Typically the ice emissivities today are known to within 0.01-0.05.

<h3>Summary</h3>
The accuracy of sea ice concentration retrievals by means of multispectral observations of thermal microwave radiation is severely limited by the lack of knowledge about the spatial and temporal variability of the emissivity of the ice.
The variability of the signatures must be taken into account in order to make better use of such data in the future, for example in climate related studies.
<p>
As one venue, the development of methods for calibration of estimated ice concentrations by means of high-resolution data from synthetic aperture radar data from ERS-1 is proposed.
<p>
Also, it is proposed to carry out a number of field campaigns in order to study and understand the temporal and regional variability of the tie point emissivities including the relationship to past and present weather (precipitation, melt, freeze ...) at the location of the ice.
<p>
In addition, the work will be complemented by theoretical studies of sea ice properties.
Algorithms will be developed that allow a synergistic use of data from a number of sources such as microwave radiometry, SAR, visible and infrared instruments and meteorological analysis fields.
<p>
The project will be coordinated with the MAST II project of the EEC in the Greenland Sea if this materializes. A wider group of investigators will thereby be involved with additional opportunities.
<p>
The methods will be developed with particular emphasis on improving the exploitation of the European microwave radiometer MIMR, which is expected to fly on the Polar Platform in 1998. An interaction with the ESA MIMR Science Advisory Group will be established.

<h1>Sea ice scattering mechanisms </h1>
<p>
This study concerns the possibilities of using
polarimetric SAR observations to enhance our knowledge about scattering
mechanisms at the ice surface and within the ice. Development
of models of active and passive microwave signatures of sea ice
is an important activity, essential to the process of combining
data from different airborne and satellite sensors with different
resolution and mapping geometry. DCRS is the PI on an ERS-1/-2
investigation on this subject.

<p>
He has been with the Electromagnetics Institute, Technical University of Denmark since 1984, when he conducted an ESA study of microwave instruments for planetary missions. Among the recent activities are the development of algorithms for polarimetric calibration of the Danish airborne SAR (EMISAR), and technical management of a SAR processing facility for semi-operational processing of EMISAR data. He was responsible for the development of a dedicated onboard full resolution real-time processor for EMISAR, and prior to that he implemented software processors for the SEASAT SAR and EMISAR systems. Other SAR activities have included development of a novel SAR autofocus algorithm, and studies of fast transform and convolution algorithms for SAR processing. He is now leading the SAR processing group at the Danish Center for Remote Sensing (DCRS).

The objective of the project is to develop an integrated analysis system for
remote sensing data to be used on UNIX workstations. This
analysis system will be constructed of a list of modules, which takes care of
specific tasks in the system.
<p>
The tasks includes display of images, data visualization in windows, in
addition to image processing functions such as filtering, classification,
segmentation, and geometrical rectification. One module will contain a range
of algorithms to analyze data for specific purposes, such as sea ice,
oceanography, forestry, and agriculture.
<p>
The user will be able to without particular knowledge about the operations of
the sensor to extract information from the satellite data with the help of
advanced applications.
<p>
The project is funded by the <I>Danish Technical Research Council (STVF)</I>.

</H1>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Since the previous newsletter, issued September 95,
the most outstanding achievement within the DCRS framework is
the successful commissioning of the across track interferometer
(XTI) mode at C-band. We are now entering a phase where more operational
processing and calibration facilities are being developed, and
the absolute geometric error is being evaluated in collaboration
with institutions involved in map making.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>9 flights have been carried out covering primarily
sites in Denmark, but also areas in Greenland and the Faroe Islands
have been mapped. All flights were in support of the DCRS programme,
i. e. no external customers this time.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The polarimetric radiometer study has entered its
experimental stage and a quite spectacular flight campaign has
started in which the instrument views the sea from a position
on the open ramp of a C-130 Hercules transport aircraft.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Last but not least: on June 18 S&oslash;ren N&oslash;rvang
Madsen, head of DCRS received &quot;H&oslash;jgaard &amp; Schultz
Jubil&aelig;umsprisen&quot;. The danish Minister for Research
and Information Technology presented the prize during a splendid
ceremony, and the press have been busy writing about S&oslash;ren
and the radar program.<BR>
</FONT>
<H1>C&amp;L-band SAR<BR>
</H1>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>EMISAR, the airborne polarimetric SAR system used
by DCRS, has been operating at C-band since 1993 while the first
test flight with the L-band subsystem was carried out in the spring
1995. Both frequencies have been used for data acquisition since
then but, in addition, the L-band subsystem has been finalized
and the capability for simultaneous dual frequency operation has
been added. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The upgrade to polarimetry has been supported by
the Danish Technical Research Council (STVF) and the European
Union, represented by the Institute for Remote Sensing Applications
of the Joint Research Centre (JRC), Ispra. The work has been completed
and the final reports to both sponsors have been submitted.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The major application of the system is data acquisition
for the research of DCRS but EMISAR has also been used to acquire
polarimetric data for EMAC (European Multi-sensor Airborne Campaigns)
organized and sponsored by the European Space Agency, ESA. This
has involved the processing of a large quantity of SAR scenes
which have been completed and delivered to ESA.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Polarimetric and radiometric calibration is an important
issue for a SAR system intended for remote sensing and this objective
has been persued by acquiring calibration data from scenes with
reference corner reflectors at all flights. The SAR includes an
internal calibration system and the quality of the overall performance
is evaluated by the residual calibration error after internal
calibration. The conclusion is that a single external calibration
per mission suffices.  The results indicate that external calibration
is hardly a necessity on each mission; however, it is still desired
as a means to confirm and possibly improve the calibration performance.
The more important performance parameters and the results of the
calibration verification are summarized in the two attached tables.

<H1>Across-track Interferometry (XTI)<BR>
</H1>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In the last issue of the newletter, the recent addition
of an across-track interferometric capability was discussed, including
a discussion of the installation and the available modes.  It
was reported that a test conducted a few weeks before had supposedly
gone well and that processing and analysis of the data were imminent.
 We can now report that many data sets have been processed and
that the preliminary results looks very promissing.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Significant amounts of data were acquired during
1995 in both Denmark and Greenland.  The &igrave;raw&icirc; height
accuracy was in the range 5 to 10 m.  An analysis of the error
showed it to be a systematic error which is a function of the
angle of each observed target relative to the interferometric
baseline (the line from one antenna to the other).  A closer analysis
of the error has lead us to believe that the systematic error
is caused by a combination of channel cross-talk at the minus
40&nbsp;dB level and also some external multipath on the aircraft.
 A phase screen calibration scheme has been developed to correct
for these errors. This phase screen calibration technique drastically
reduces systematic errors, and analyses of data acquired in Denmark
where the topographic relief is moderate (heights vary from 0
to 137&nbsp;m in the data analyzed) indicates that the height
error after removing a tilted plane is from 1&nbsp;m in the near
range to 3 m in the far range (at 10&nbsp;m horizontal pixel spacing)
when operating from 41,000 ft.  Data acquired in the double baseline
mode on a 25,000&nbsp;ft. pass over the same area indicates stochastic
height errors of 0.6&nbsp;m rms. in the far range.  Studies are
presently on-going to evaluate the height error performance in
more detail, however, sufficiently accurate reference data are
not readily available.  A shaded relief image of a subsection
of a 25,000&nbsp;ft. pass is shown in Fig. 1.</FONT>

The interferometric processor simultaneously processes the two

a common reference line. The processor also includes automatic
determination of the absolute phase. The output products include

<FONT SIZE=2>In the period September 1995 to June 1996 nine flights
have been conducted in support of the DCRS technology and Earth
science research, see Table 4.<BR>

<IMG SRC="IMG00002.GIF">
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Three of the March flights were part of a campaign
to Greenland while the others covered areas in Denmark.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>On November 23, data sets from six different sites
were collected. At Vejle, Hvorslev and Fur the National Survey
and Cadastre (KMS) has generated accurate Digital Elevation Models
by photogrammetric techniques and they are conducting pilot projects
providing reference data that are valuable for DCRS.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>During the Greenland campaign sea ice was mapped
at Kap Farewell (KF) and in the Greenland Sea (GS). The data from
the Daug&aring;rd Jensen Glacier (DJ) are mainly intended for
RTI applications as are the R&aring;bjerg Mile data.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The flights in June were recorded by Danish Televison.
The recordings are to be used for a children's programme called
the Curious Camera.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Some of the flights have served a technological purpose
in addition to the Earth science purpose. In November XTI data
were acquired from both 41.000 ft. and 25.000 ft. altitude in
order to examine the performance of the system and to improve
the XTI calibration. On April 22 simultaneous L- and C-band data
acquisition was tested for the first time, and on April 23 and
June 18 several ILS experiments were conducted.<BR>
</FONT>
<H1>Soil and Plant Studies at Research Centre Foulum<BR>
</H1>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Soil moisture data collected during the 1995 field
experiments over Research Center Foulum showed that soil moisture
varied spatially within the field scale. The estimated standard
deviations of soil moisture contents using more than 60 independent
samples were up to 4% in a field. This relatively large variation
sets a lower bound for the estimation of the SAR retrieved soil
moisture in the field scale.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>SAR data acquired at C-band during 1994 and L- &amp;
C-band during 1995, as well as the field measured soil and plant
data have been integrated. Six algorithms, including the theoretical
Integral Equation Model, have been used to retrieve soil moisture
and surface roughness with the data set. Dubois's algorithm showed
a reasonable solution better than the others, but the discrepancy
is still large between the measured and retrieved values with
RMS-errors up to 8 %.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Simultaneous with the L- &amp; C-band EMISAR flight
during April 22-23 1996, an extensive field experiment at Foulum
has been performed based on the improvement of skills in moisture
and roughness measurements. Four bare fields and a wheat field
were involved. A quasi-flat surface within a bare field was rolled
in order to test the roughness influence on SAR backscatter. The
scanning laser altimeter developed at RCF was used to perform
eight 2-meter transect roughness measurements. Soil moisture data
along five transects in the fields were collected at every 10-20
meters with TDR and ring methods. Roughness data have been processed
and the results showed a large variation in autocorrelation lengths
like that investigated with the 94-95 data. Soil moisture data
have just arrived and a preliminary check showed that the spatial
variation is reduced by the precisely controlled measurement compared
to the 1995 experiments.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Multi-temporal and multi-frequency signatures for
agricultural crops have been studied. The signatures show a significant
variation during the growing-season, enabling the discrimination
between the crops. Also, some variation is observed between the
fields for the individual crops, especially in the early spring,
where the backscatter from the surface strongly depends on plowing
and sowing directions relative to the flight track. Furthermore,
the variation at L-band is seen to be significantly larger than
at C-band. The polarimetric parameters, phase difference and correlation
between HH and VV show good potential for discimination between
the crops. A Ph. D. study has been initiated as a collaboration
between DCRS and the Danish Institute of Plant and Soil Science.
The study is funded under the DANMAC project and aims at studying
discrimination methods for agricultural crops using polarimetric
and interferometric SAR data.<BR>

<H1>Glacier Dynamics Studies<BR>
</H1>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>A prototype repeat track interferometer processor
for airborne as well as satellite SAR data has been tested. The
airborne EMISAR data from 1995 have been processed and the data
look promising for extraction of velocities; not yet demonstrated
elsewhere with any airborne system.  Tandem mode interferometry
data from the ESA satellites ERS-1 and ERS-2 have also been processed.
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The ERS satellites are operated in a tandem mode
such that, seen from the Earth, ERS&#173;2 repeats the ERS&#173;1
trajectory with a one day delay.  The satellites are in a 35&nbsp;day
repeat cycle, thus allowing the generation of one interferogram
with a one day temporal baseline every 35&nbsp;day for any area.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The raw ERS data are processed with the new improved
processor, with an additional front-end correcting for missing
lines and sampling window changes. In Figure&nbsp;2 a raw interferogram
covering a 100&nbsp;km by 200&nbsp;km area around the Storstr&oslash;mmen
glacier is shown.  On the left the interferogram phase is shown,
on the right the amplitude. The phase is color coded and is repeated
for each <IMG SRC="IMG00003.GIF">, in this case corresponding
to either a change in the terrain height of 800&nbsp;m or a line
of sight motion of 2.8&nbsp;cm/day.  </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Manually counting the fringes on the mountains shows
that a minor tilt of 1-2 fringes is still present.  It is also
noted that the topography in this area can account for at most
2&nbsp;fringes.  Thus the fringe pattern on the upper part of
the glacier (with an eastward flow) must be due to a horizontal
surface velocity of approximately 300 m/y in the central part
decreasing to approximately zero at the sides.  This is in good
agreement with the velocities measured by the Danish Polar Center
by repeated GPS survey of stakes drilled into the glacier. The
almost vanishing fringe pattern on the lower part (with a southward
flow) can not easily be interpreted.  The interferometric techniques
relies on the measurement of small range shifts in the line of
sight direction from image acquisition to image acquisition. 
Thus only motion perpendicular to the orbit can be measured and
the sensitivity to a southward flow parallel to the orbit is zero.
 </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Two interferograms with a 35&nbsp;day separation
have presently been generated, in principle allowing the separation
of motion and topography induced phase.  However, one of the interferograms
is rather difficult to phase unwrap, likely due to temporal decorrelation
caused by surface melting, thus resulting in a low correlation
interferogram.  This is hoped to be eliminated in the three tandem
data set acquired later in 1995, just received from ESA.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=2>Figure 2.  Raw Interferogram from ESA ERS-1/2 tandem
data acquired late July, 1995.  From having an eastward flow (upper
left corner) at an altitude of 600 m a.s.l. the glacier splits
into a northern branch, Koefod-Hansen Br&aelig;, and a southern,
Storstr&oslash;mmen.  Just south of the white rectangle, the airborne
test-area, it merges with Bistrup Br&aelig;, turns to the east
and terminates in steep calving front.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>As opposed to the satellite data phase unwrapping
has until now proven very easy with the airborne EMISAR data.
 The major issue is a low frequency, drift in the Inertial Navigation
Unit measuring the airplane flight path.  If not compensated,
this drift will be misinterpreted as a movement of the glacier,
from the first day to the second.  The bulk part of this drift
has been identified as linear drift in the acceleration biases,
and has been estimated.  It is believed that the remaining uncertainty
of some centimeters, also originates from drift, but this still
has to be confirmed. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In Figure 3, two interferograms from the EMISAR August
mission to Storstr&oslash;mmen is shown.  The upper interferogram
mainly reflects the topography, the lower topography and flow.
 The remaining uncertainty on the spatial baselines inhibits an
extraction of the flow, but it is seen that the flow are significantly
slower than at higher elevations.  Also note the feature in the
lower right corner with a dense fringe pattern.  This might be
caused by a tidal uplift of the glacier.<BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>L-band polarimetric data and XTI data acquired over
an area from Kangerdlugssuaq to Watkins Bjerge (East Greenland)
in August 1995 are currently analysed. In all, a stripe of 120
km in length was covered, at a ground width of 12.6 km with the
polarimeter and 8.6 km with the interferometer. A visual inspection
of the polarimetric data in comparison to a detailed geologic
map of the Kangerdlugssuaq area indicates that the L-band radar
signatures of different geological lithologies are difficult to
distinguish as are, according to previous analyses, the C-band
signatures. In general, the radar signatures seem to be more variable
at L-band than at C-band. Outcrops of lava on the sides of the
mountains, on the other hand, show up more clearly in the C-band
images from 1994. It is planned to correct the L- and C-band polarimetric
data geometrically and radiometrically utilzing a topographic
map generated from the XTI data. On the basis of geologic maps,
the polarimetric responses of different geological units (as,
e.g. moraines, alluvial sediments, lavas and intrusions) will
be analysed as a function of the local radar incidence angle.
The results of these analyses will help to assess the possibility
of using SAR images in the geological research of Arctic areas.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>During the first days of June, Dr. Tom Farr from
the Jet Propulsion Laboratory visited the DCRS and gave a presentation
about SAR data applied to geology. Dr. Farr&iacute;s research
work focuses, among others, on analysing the microtopographic
evolution of lava flows and the structure of alluvial fans in
desert areas. In a number of discussions, Dr. Farr gave stimulations
for our geology project at DCRS. During one of these meetings,
Louise Hansen from the Geological Museum in Copenhagen presented
a summary of her work on Pleistocene depositional environments
on Jameson Land (East Greenland). The possibility of acquiring
polarimetric and XTI data over these environments was discussed,
since the deposits are characterized by different surface morphologies
which probably can be distinguished in the radar images, and a
lot of field data are already available which could be the basis
for analysing the radar signatures.<BR>
</FONT>
<H1>Sea Ice Studies<BR>
</H1>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>On January 1, DCRS and the Danish Meteorological
Institute (DMI) started a joint project concerning applications
of microwave remote sensing data in operational ice monitoring
in South Greenland waters. During the project we will investigate
the possibilities of using coarse resolution microwave radiometer
observations from satellite to extend traditional ice maps (based
on weather-dependent visual and infrared techniques) into cloud
covered regions. A pilot experiment to gain initial experience
was carried out in connection with a cruise by the German research
vessel Valdivia into the Greenland Sea in April-May 1996.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Another side of the project concerns the use of Synthetic
Aperture Radar (SAR) data in operational ice monitoring. Both
DMI and DCRS are Principle Investigators on the recently launched
Canadian RADARSAT satellite which carries a SAR with the ability
to map large (500 kilometer) areas on each satellite pass. In
March 1996 (12-15) DMI &amp; DCRS carried out a joint underflight
experiment with the aims of evaluating RADARSAT capabilities and
to study polarimetric SAR signatures in south Greenland Waters.
The experiment consisted of a flight around Kap Farvel with two
aircraft, the G3 Gulfstream of the RDAF equipped with DCRS's polarimetric
C-band SAR, and a Twin-Otter aircraft of the DMI equipped with
video recording and photographic equipment as well as trained
ice observers from DMI.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Also on January 1, DCRS participation in the European
Commissions European Sub-polar Ocean Project - phase 2, started.
DCRS obligations are production of microwave remote sensing based
ice maps of the Greenland Sea and sorrounding waters, and determination
of ice motion from satellite SAR images of The Greenland Sea.
These activities are in support of a large physical and chemical
oceanography experiment that takes place from the summer of 1996
and runs for at least two years.<BR>
</FONT>
<H1>Polarimetric Radiometry<BR>
</H1>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Until a few years ago it was assumed that a measurement
of the vertical and the horizontal brightness temperature exhausted
the radiometric possibilities for a given frequency and geometry.
Lately, it has been proven that in some cases independent, new
information is available by measuring the third Stokes parameter
(related to the correlation of the vertical and horizontal electrical
fields). This has first been noticed for the ocean surface where
it seems possible to measure wind speed and direction with a polarimetric
radiometer. The observations have led to resent activity in the
radiometer community, and for example JPL is carrying out aircraft
measurements and model work. The JPL aircraft program employs
a staring radiometer pointed towards the sea surface while the
aircraft makes full 360&#176; turns. Thus the radiometric signature
as a function of look angle relative to the wind direction is
investigated.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>However, one thing is to find the signature using
a staring radiometer with a long integration time hence good radiometric
sensitivity (and having the benefit of full circles), another
thing is to be able to directly determine the wind direction pixel
for pixel based on data from an imager with its inherent short
integration time hence inferior sensitivity. This is of course
the situation for a potential future satellite wind sensor, and
aircraft test experiments with a realistic radiometer configuration
are highly warranted.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The existing EMIRAD airborne, scanning antenna system
has been combined with the also existing correlation radiometer
(developed for synthetic aperture radiometry work) into an imaging,
polarimetric radiometer system. During May 1996, two  flights
over Danish waters were carried out with low to moderate winds,
while a third attempt had to be cancelled due to low winds. Passes
over a target area were carried out in the imaging mode but also
some circle flights were performed. Data has not yet been analysed
in depth, but an initial inspection of the circle flight data
confirms the JPL measurements and confirms that the radiometer
system performed well during the experiments.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Further experiments will be carried out during the
fall in the Atlantic off the coast of Brittany. It is hoped and
expected to encounter moderate to high wind conditions.<BR>

<H3>Editorial</H3>

<P>
The winter/spring of 95 has marked an important change concerning
the activities of quite a few DCRS personnel: from working primarily
with development of the EMISAR system to working more and more
on using the system for geophysical experiments and interpretation
of data.
<P>
The L-band system has been finalized and after a brief commissioning
phase entered regular service. The C-band across-track interferometer
option has been implemented and checked out. Thus EMISAR is now
a very powerful instrument with C and L-band fully polarimetric
capability as well as C-band across-track interferometry.
<P>
This instrument has been used extensively for the busy 1995 flight
campaign featuring 21 flights utilizing all possible modes of
the radar. The processing group of DCRS will not find themselves
out of work for some time, not to mention the science group and
external partners eager to work on the data.
<H3>C&amp;L-band SAR</H3>

<P>
An L-band polarimetric SAR system has been developed as part of
the dual frequency (L &amp; C-band), polarimetric, airborne EMISAR
system. During the past winter the L-band SAR was completed and
the first flights were carried out over Denmark. The SAR features
a unique combination of fine resolution (2 x 2 m) and wide swath
(9.3 km). The transmitter power is 6 kW. From a flight altitude
of 41000 ft the range of the radar is 64 km with a noise equivalent
sigma naught of - 20 dB.
<P>
Combining the relatively wide bandwidth of 100 MHz at L-band with
a flat array antenna concept is somewhat a challenge. A stacked
microstrip patch array concept has been used. The feed structure
is on the back side of the antenna panel to reduce unwanted radiation.
The cross polar level is below -35 dB.
<P>
The polarization switch is a relatively conventional PIN diode
switch matrix able to sustain the 6 kW peak power from the transmitter
still exhibiting low loss (0.3 dB) and high isolation (more than
50 dB). Thus system cross talk (between polarizations) is dominated
by antenna cross talk and is some -35 dB.
<P>
The L &amp; C-band polarimetric EMISAR instrument is one of the
key sensors in the JRC EARSEC initiative aiming at being able
to supply state-of-the-art remote sensing data to European scientists.
<H3>Across-track Interferometry (XTI)</H3>

<P>
For some time now, DCRS has planned to establish an across-track
interferometric capability operating at C-band. XTI has many potential
applications both as an instrument which provides scientific measurements
and as an operational sensor in the mapping business. An across-track
interferometer consists of two antennas, preferably at the same
along-track position on the radar platform (in this case an aircraft).
The two antennas will observe the radar scene from slightly different
elevation angles and this makes it possible to determine the 3-dimensional
location of all targets. However, whereas shifts in photographic
stereo image pairs are determined from the actual resolution of
the photos, the image to image displacement of an interferometric
radar pair is determined from the phase shift of the radio frequency
signals. This makes it feasible to measure displacements of targets
on the order of millimeters or less and that makes "radar
stereo" very powerful for height determination even if
the baseline is as small as a meter. And contrary to repeat track
interferometry (RTI) where the image pair is obtained on consecutive
flight passes the XTI images forming a pair are acquired simultaneously
thus even the 3-dimensional location of moving targets (e.g. a
sea surface or leaves on trees) can be determined. The radar measurement
of topography is a powerful complement to photogrammetric height
determination for many reasons such as: 1) All weather, day and
night capability; 2) efficient processing schemes; and 3) works
well in areas with little visual contrast (e.g. over inland ice,
sand dunes, and other homogeneous areas) where optical stereo
fails or performs poorly.
<P>
The antenna installation consists of two flush mounted fairings
designed and fabricated by the Air Materiel Command of the Danish
Air Force and two polarimetric microstrip antennas designed and
fabricated at DCRS by Johan Granholm and Kenn Christensen. The
antennas are looking to the left and the interferometric baseline
is 0.94 um horizontally and 0.64 um vertically for a
total baseline length of 1.14um and an orientation inclined
34 degrees with respect to horizontal. The antenna system incorporates
switches which will allow any one of the two antennas to be operated
as a fully polarimetric antenna sequentially transmitting a horizontally
and a vertically polarized signal and simultaneously receiving
both polarizations. The antenna system supports both signal transmission
and reception on both the upper and the lower antenna, at either
polarization.  The XTI modes initially implemented: 1) The
single-baseline mode, transmitting on one antenna (lower or upper)
receiving the echo on both (two channels); 2) The double-baseline
mode, transmitting and receiving on one antenna then transmitting
and receiving on the opposite (two channels); and 3) The
dual-baseline mode, transmitting on one antenna, receiving on
both, then transmitting on the opposite antenna and receiving
on both (four channels). The VV or the HH polarization can be
chosen as desired.  The single baseline mode is well suited for
mapping the topography in very rough terrain (such as many places
in Greenland), the double baseline mode will optimize the topographic
sensitivity in gentler terrain, where the maximum height accuracy
is required (e.g. in Denmark), and the dual-baseline mode will
allow for certain experiments with measuring the topography and
simultaneously estimating the penetration depth of the radar signal
which could potentially provide information of forest or canopy
depth.
<P>
The interferometry installation was first tested in April this
year. Unfortunately the installation is fairly close to the ports
used to measure the static air pressure on the aircraft. The test
flight revealed that the antenna installation changed the barometric
altitude measurement by up to a 1000 feet when flying at 41000
feet which is not acceptable for air safety reasons. This instigated
a cooperative effort between the Air Materiel Command and DCRS
to develop correction circuitry in the air data computer which
can be switched on when the interferometric antennas are installed.
Unfortunately this unforeseen problem prevented us from collecting
interferometric data over the summer as originally planned. The
additional circuitry for the air data computer was developed by
the end of July and a new test flight performed on August 15th
demonstrated that the correction worked as designed.  The installation
was then approved by the Air Force for data collection flights
and the XTI mode was used extensively in this years data collection
mission to Greenland, August 21-26. During this mission topographic
data were collected over both rough mountain ranges in eastern
Greenland and over glaciers in Northeast Greenland. This falls
activities will include processing and evaluation of the data.
<H3>Flight Campaigns Spring-95</H3>

<P>
The spring and summer '95 were very busy. Twenty-one flights covering
areas in Southern Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland, the Faeroe
Islands, and Greenland were carried out. Ten flights were used
for DCRS science data collection, seven flights were requested
by ESA, and four flights were used for testing new system features.
<P>
The first DCRS science flight took place on March 24 where C-band
polarimetric data were collected over the sea-ice in the Greenland
Sea. On April 27, C-band repeat track interferometry (RTI) data
were collected at the Raabjerg Mile area, and C-band polarimetric
data were collected at &Aringlborg, Foulum, and Kal&oslash;. On
April 28, L-band RTI data were collected at Raabjerg Mile, and
polarimetric L-band data were collected at Aggersborg, Foulum,
Kal&oslash;, and Gjern. On June 8, L-band polarimetric data were
collected at Foulum, Kal&oslash;, and Copenhagen. On July 4, C and
L-band polarimetric data were collected at Raabjerg Mile (RTI),
Foulum, Kal&oslash;, and Gjern (L-band only). 
<P>
The Greenland mission consisted of three flights used for data
collection over Greenland, and two transit flights used for data
collection over the Faeroe Islands and Southern Denmark. On August
21, cross track Interferometry (XTI) data were collected at Kal&oslash;
and at Thorshavn on the Faeroe Islands, and L-band polarimetric
data were collected at Copenhagen and Thorshavn. 
<P>
On August 22, L-band RTI data and C-band XTI data were collected
at the Storstr&oslash;mmen glacier in north-east Greenland. XTI
data were also collected at Zackenberg in east Greenland. On August
23, the August 22 flight was repeated. On August 24, C-band XTI
data and L-band polarimetric data were collected in an area 500
km south of Scoresbysund, and C-band XTI data were collected in
an area near Scoresbysund. On August 25, L-band polarimetric data
were collected at Raabjerg Mile, Foulum, and Thorshavn.
<P>
The flights requested by ESA are a part of the European Multi-sensor
Airborne Campaign (EMAC-95). Four areas were covered. The Nopex
area near Uppsala in Sweden was covered on May 1-2 and July 5-6.
One area near Okstindan in Norway was covered on March 22-23,
May 1-2, and July 5-6. Two areas near Oulu in Finland were covered
on March 22-23 and May 1-2. All areas were mapped by the C and
L-band polarimetric system. 
<P>
The purpose of the two first test flights was to test the new
L-band system. On March 2, data were collected at the test sites
at Foulum and Kal&oslash;, and on March 21, test data were collected
at Raabjerg Mile, Foulum, and Kal&oslash;. The third test flight
took place on April 26. The purpose of this flight was to test
the new two-antenna installation that makes it possible to acquire
cross track interferometry data. Data were collected at the sites
at Raabjerg Mile, Foulum, and Kal&oslash;. The final XTI test flight
took place on August 15, where data were collected at Raabjerg
Mile.
<P>
An additional flight is planned to take place in November. C-band
XTI data will be collected over four locations in Southern Denmark.
<H3>Soil and Plant Studies at Research Centre Foulum</H3>

<P>
The soil and plant measurement campaigns over Research Centre
Foulum (RCF) have been continued during 1995. In 1994 data were
collected at C-band (5 cm wavelength) at four different
times during the growth season (28/4, 23/6, 29/7, and 27/8). These
data showed the very significant variation over the growth season
in the radar backscatter and the polarimetric signatures. This
year the addition of the polarimetric L-band (24 cm wavelength)
channel has provided substantially different data as the longer
wavelength is characterised by a much larger penetration depth.
Data at both L- and C-band have been collected during the period
March through August. The data analyses is still in the preliminary
stage but as expected the 24 cm channel is much more reliable
in relation to measurements of soil properties. It now seems feasible
that spatial soil moisture measurements can be provided by airborne
radar with an accuracy on the order of 3-5% (volumetric water
contents), and indications are that the surface roughness can
also be measured quite accurately. Key elements in the measurements
are absolute backscatter calibration and polarimetric capability.
At RCF a scanning laser altimeter system has been developed and
tested which will for instance scan the surface roughness over
a 2 by 0.5 m area with a horizontal resolution better than
1 mm and a vertical resolution better than 0.2 mm.
This instrument in combination with dielectric measurement will
be instrumental to providing in-situ measurements needed for electromagnetic
modelling work which will commence this fall in a Ph.D. study.
This work will eventually lead to better models for relating geophysical
parameters to the radar backscatter signatures measured by a high
resolution polarimetric SAR system. Early results from the Foulum
studies were presented in two papers at the IGARSS'95 conference
and at the PIERS'95 conference.
<H3>Landscape and Ecology Studies at Kal&oslash;</H3>

<P>
The Kal&oslash; site is on the same flight line as the Foulum site,
thus data have been collected on the same acquisition dates. As
in the soil and plant studies the addition of a longer wavelength
has provided data which are substantially different from C-band
data. In particular it seems that the longer wavelength will be
of importance for the forest studies which are important in relation
to this project. The longer wavelength, for instance, means that
it takes much larger biomass densities to saturate the radar backscatter
which is generally an increasing function of the biomass per square
kilometer.
<H3>Applications of SAR Repeat-track Interferometry for Sand Dune
Dynamics and Glacier Dynamics Studies</H3>

<P>
Data collections in the repeat-track interferometry (RTI) mode
have included several missions to the Raabjerg Mile test area
and two missions to the Storstr&oslash;mmen Glacier in North East
Greenland. In the RTI mode the aircraft is flown by the radar
control computer based on real-time P-code GPS navigation data
via an interface to the aircraft ILS (instrument landing system).
Aircraft control algorithm improvements have brought the accuracy
with which the aircraft tracks the desired reference line from
the ten meter level achieved in 1994 to 1 to 2 meters this
year. A second significant achievement is that RTI data can now
be collected at L-band. The longer wavelength has many advantages
which includes: 1) Less temporal decorrelation from track
to track (as L-band tends to see the ground that is stationary
whereas C-band is more sensitive to for instance leaves that are
usually non-stationary on a wavelength scale); and 2) the longer
wavelength allows the use of larger baselines without making the
phase unwrapping process exceedingly difficult.
<P>
Presently, photogrammetric reference data from 1994 covering the
test area at Raabjerg Mile are being reduced to a reference Digital
Elevation Model (DEM) which will be used to evaluate the performance
of the radar generated DEM's. The first step of the Sand
Dune Dynamics study involves developing radar interferometric
techniques that will allow us to generate submeter level DEM's
over a dune field (which has little optical contrast) during all
times of the year. Selected L-band RTI data and C-band XTI data
acquired over Raabjerg Mile during 1995 will be processed to topographic
data during the fall.
<P>
The Storstr&oslash;mmen Glacier was mapped with L-band RTI as well
as with C-band XTI on two consecutive days in late August. The
purpose of the Glacier Dynamics Study is to investigate whether
SAR interferometry can be used to measure both glacier topography
and glacier velocities, parameters of importance to inland ice
mass balance calculations. This years data collection is considered
to be a major improvement over last years C-band RTI data for
several reasons. First of all the addition of the XTI mode provides
us with an independent measurement of the glacier topography whereas
the RTI measurement only provides a measurement which is both
influenced by topography and displacements in the scene. If only
RTI data are available then the two effects can only be separated
if multiple linearly independent baselines are available. Secondly,
the use of the longer L-band wavelength allowed the use of tracks
which are spaced further apart (e.g. 50 m) which in combination
with near repeat tracks provides for a better separation between
topography and velocity. Thirdly, by flying on consecutive days
the time baselines available are extended from the range of 20 minutes
to 2 hours available in 1994 up to 24 hours which further
improves the ability to separate topography and velocity effects,
and this also improves the velocity sensitivity by more than an
order of magnitude. Work on the interferometric processing algorithms
is continuing and significant progress has been made in the fields
of motion compensation both with respect to synchronization of
navigation and radar data, in relation to integrating GPS and
INS (inertial navigation system) data and with respect to extracting
information from the data itself. We presently believe that we
can estimation the instantaneous baseline variation over a 30 km
track with an accuracy on the order of 2 cm which is, however,
not quite satisfactory. Work is on-going to use the data themselves
to further improve on this crucial baseline estimate.
<H3>Geology</H3>

<P>
A polarimetric analysis has been applied to the C-band data acquired
from the Kangerdlugssuaq area in 1994. This analysis has confirmed
the preliminary conclusion made after a visual inspection of the
imagery: a geologic classification cannot be based on the polarimetric
C-band data. The morphology of weathered gneiss and gabbro, for
instance, are so similar that the backscatter coefficients, polarization
signatures, polarimetric decompositions etc. of these two lithologies
are indistinguishable.
<P>
The extreme topography in the Kangerdlugssuaq area has proved
a major obstacle for the geologic interpretation of the SAR imagery.
Therefore the 1995 test site was extended to a 100 km long strip
from Kangerdlugssuaq to Watkins Bjerge where areas with more gentle
topography are found. For the same reason XTI data were acquired.
The digital elevation model to be generated from these XTI data
will allow the SAR imagery to be geometrically and radiometrically
corrected for the topography.
<P>
The polarimetric data were acquired at L-band this year. Since
SARs are sensitive to features with a size comparable to the wavelength
used, morphologic differences not reflected in the C-band data
might show up in the L-band data.
<H3>Sea Ice Studies</H3>

<P>
Sea ice research has been concentrated within two areas: development
of methods to analyse data from airborne and satellite microwave
instruments, and application of these methods in process and/or
climate oriented studies.
<P>
Analysis methods:
<P>
In order to make full use of microwave remote sensing data of
sea ice and ocean surfaces a major part of our work has been in
studying and understanding microwave signatures of these surfaces.
The variability is large, and we are in the process of getting
an improved understanding of the physical properties of the ice
that gives rise to the variations. Satellite SAR data from the
Greenland Sea for a two year period has been studied in detail
in order to map the seasonal variability of the backscatter coefficient
at VV polarization.
<P>
First results from the August 1994 flight with the C-band polarimetric
SAR were presented at IGARSS-95. A field experiment with two aircraft
was carried out on March 25, 1995. The RDAF Gulfstream was equipped
with the Polarimetric C-band SAR, and a Twin Otter of the Greenland
Ice Branch of the Danish Meteorological Institute was equipped
with DCRS's 3-channel profiling microwave radiometer, video cameras,
and hand held cameras for aerial photography. The experiment coincided
with an ERS-1 SAR passage of the area. Data are now being analysed.
<P>
Application projects:
<P>
DCRS participate in a number of projects where satellite microwave
remote sensing data are applied in an attempt to solve climate
related problems. In ESOP (European Subpolar Ocean Project, EU
MAST-2) we use microwave radiometer data from the NIMBUS-7 and
DMSP satellites to map large scale sea ice conditions in the Greenland
Sea area for a 16 year period, and we use a combination of SSM/I
and ERS-1 SAR data to monitor the processes going on in the Greenland
Sea during the winters of 1993, 1994 and 1995. In PELICON (Project
for Estimation of Long term Ice CONcentration, EU ENV) we develop
methods for intercalibration of long time series of microwave
radiometer data from the Wedell and Bellingshausen seas around
Antarctica. In the NEW project (North East Water)  we apply visible
and infrared data from NOAA AVHRR, ERS-1 SAR and passive microwave
satellite data in order to map the development of the North East
Water polynya.

<H3>Editorial</H3>
<P>
This is the first issue of the DCRS newsletters that will provide
a bi-yearly overview over activities at the Danish Center for
Remote Sensing (DCRS). DCRS is established at the Electromagnetics
Institute, Technical University of Denmark, with a 5 year grant
from the Danish National Research Foundation (Danmarks Grundforskningsfond).
The purpose of the center is to conduct research relating to instruments
for remote sensing and their application to Earth observation
and Earth Science. DCRS commenced its operation on February 1,
1994, taking over a number of activities already on-going in EMI's
radar group. The inauguration of the center took place on November
23.
<P>
The center's current activities include enhancing EMI's
airborne polarimetric C-band SAR with an L-band channel and augmenting
this system with interferometric capabilities, which will allow
DCRS to generate 3-D and velocity images. One important achievement
in 1994 was the successful testing of a system which allows the
radar control computer to steer the aircraft very accurately using
GPS as the navigational reference. This capability is extremely
important for repeat-track-interferometry data acquisitions. Other
important achievements within sensor techniques have been the
development of interferometric (synthetic aperture) radiometer
systems and associated processing algorithms.
<P>
Besides the system development activities, 1994 has been a very
busy year for DCRS with several data collection campaigns. The
agricultural test area in Foulum, Jutland, was for instance mapped
on 4 occasions during the period April 28 to August 27. Other
sites in Denmark which were mapped include Kal, Gjern and
Rbjerg Mile. The drifting sand dunes at Rbjerg Mile
was mapped using both polarimetric and repeat-track-interferometric
techniques and a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) based on radar
data alone has been generated. In August a very successful data
collection campaign was also conducted in Greenland. The scientific
applications included mapping of glacier dynamics, geologic mapping,
and sea ice signature studies.
<P>
DCRS has also been very successful with its ERS-1/-2 proposals.
DCRS is the principal investigator on 4 studies and co-investigator
on one. In all studies the comparison of satellite data and airborne
high resolution polarimetric data is an important ingredient.
<P>
An important New Years event is the integration of DCRS and EMI's
Remote Sensing Unit which was headed by professor Gudmandsen until
his retirement in October. The integration will officially take
effect by January 1, 1995.
<P>
On behalf of all of us at DCRS we wish you a Merry X-mas and happy
and productive New Year!

<H3>DCRS Inauguration</H3>
<P>
The formal inauguration of the Danish Center for Remote Sensing
took place on November 23, eventhough the Center started its work
on February 1, 1994. After welcome addresses by the director of
EMI (Bent Knudsen) and the director of the University (Hans Peter
Jensen), the director of the Danish National Research Foundation
(Peder Olesen Larsen) gave a short keynote address about the background
for the center.
<P>
The head of DCRS (Sren Nrvang Madsen) gave a lecture
about the Center primarily based on its research plan.
<P>
After that, a reception took place at the premises of EMI, and
the invitees had a chance to see the facilities of DCRS like the
key sensor (the SAR) and hardware development laboratories as
well as the processing lab.
<P>
Some 60 persons attended the inauguration.
<P>
<H3>Flight Campaign 1994</H3>
<P>
During 1994 eight missions covering areas in Southern Denmark,
Sweden, Faroe Islands, and Greenland was carried out. The first
mission took place on April 28. The purpose was to acquire radar
data at the DCRS test sites in Southern Denmark. Repeat track
interferometry (RTI) data was collected at the Raabjerg Mile area,
and C-band polarimetric data was collected at the test sites at
Foulum and Kaloe.
<P>
The second mission took place on June 23. This mission was ordered
by the European Space Agency, and the purpose was to acquire data
at the Nopex test area near Uppsala in Sweden. C-band polarimetric
data was collected at three sites in the Nopex area and at the
DCRS test sites in Foulum, Gjern,and Kaloe.
<P>
The third mission took place on July 28. The purpose of this mission
was to acquire data at the DCRS sites in Southern Denmark. RTI
data was collected at the test area in Raabjerg Mile, and C-band
polarimetry was collected at the DCRS test areas at Foulum, Gjern,
and Kaloe. Polarimetric data covering Aalborg airfield was also
collected.
<P>
The Greenland campaign consisted of three missions covering the
DCRS test areas in Greenland, and two transit missions used for
data collection over Southern Denmark. 
<P>
On August 21 RTI data was collected at the Raabjerg Mile area,
and C-band polarimetric data covering Thorshavn on the Faroe Islands
was acquired. On August 22 RTI data was collected at the Storstroemmen
glacier in Northeast  Greenland. On August 23 C-band polarimetric
data was collected in a 25 by 25 km area at Kangerdlugssuaq 500
km south of Scoresbysund in East Greenland. On August 26 C-band
polarimetric data covering a 500 km strip of sea-ice was collected.
On August 27 C-band polarimetric data covering Thorshavn, Skagen,
Foulum, and Copenhagen was collected.
<P>
<H3>Repeat-Track Interferometry</H3>
<P>
Repeat track interferometry (RTI) was first demonstrated using
satellite data from the SEASAT SAR. Later studies have used ERS-1
and J-ERS-1 satellite data. Applications have included
topographic mapping, change detection, and studies of dynamic
phenomena, e.g. earthquakes and glaciers. Despite the fact that
airborne systems have several advantages compared to satellite
systems when it comes to studies and demonstration programs, similar
application have not been demonstrated using aircraft data. The
reason is that aircraft are very difficult to navigate on multiple
passes and the required small and parallel baselines are seldom
achieved. Typically baselines less than 100 m are required
and standard aircraft navigation accuracy is on the order of a
kilometre.
<P>
DCRS has designed, implemented, and tested a tight coupling of
navigation, radar control, and aircraft flight management system
to meet the requirements for an aircraft RTI system. This allows
the radar to control the aircraft through one of two redundant
Instrument Landing System (ILS) interfaces installed on the aircraft.
The polarimetric Cband system developed at EMI is operated on
a Danish Air Force Gulfstream G-3 aircraft at a nominal altitude
of 12.5 km. A slant range swath in excess of 9 km
is mapped in the high resolution mode (1.5 m pixel spacing).
<P>
The basic functionality of this aircraft control system is: 1)
A desired reference track is input into the radar control computer,
as well as cross-track and height off-sets -these are typically
in the range 0 to 100 m. 2) The radar control computer (RCP)
reads a real-time P-code Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver
and compares the actual positions with the desired track and calculates
horizontal and vertical off-sets. 3) The RCP generates emulated
ILS signals which are feed to one of the on-board flight management
systems. An important element of the implementation is the servo
loop that calculates the ILS control signal based on the above
mentioned position and velocity inputs and a model of the aircraft
dynamic behaviour.
<P>
The system was tested on a number of flights during the summer
of 1994, and data was collected over several test sites. One data
set has been reduces to a Digital Elevation Model. The achieved
baselines as estimated from the radar data have been compared
to the desired baselines and baselines predicted from the GPS
data and the preliminary analysis shows that it is possible to
bring the aircraft to within 1 m of the reference. Currently
the uncertainty on the reference is somewhat larger, on the order
of 15 m.
<P>
The RTI capability is particularly important for two of the Center's
scientific studies. One is the investigation: <B>The Dynamics
of Sand Dunes;</B> conducted in collaboration with Keld Rmer
Rasmussen, Department of Earth Sciences, University of Aarhus.
An important property of the Earth's surface is the friction
it exerts on atmospheric circulation. For a given wind it determines
the extent of soil removal, loss of nutrients and seeds from fields,
sediment transport in dunes, dust generation and subsequently
desertification by drifting sand. Aerodynamic roughness is known
to be correlated with the textural properties of the ground -surface
roughness- that can be measured by radar polarimetry. Sediment
transport, i.e. the flux of material per unit width per unit time,
is practically impossible to measure accurately by conventional
techniques in complex dune fields. This study concern the use
of interferometric SAR techniques to derive detailed topographic
information for the Rbjerg Mile dune field at the required
vertical resolution. With a time series of such data sets the
sediment transport can be estimated. An important attribute is
that radar is weather-independent and the data processing very
efficient. DCRS is the PI on an ERS-1/-2 investigation
on applying interferometric SAR satellite techniques to both this
area and a larger dune field in southern California.
<P>
The second study relying heavily on the RTI capability is <B>Glacier
Dynamics: SAR Repeat-track-interferometry Applied to Storstrmmen
Glacier, Northeast Greenland,</B> a collaboration with Niels Reeh,
Danish Polar Center. The ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctic
act as long-term reservoirs in the hydrological cycle, and changes
in their size are therefore an indicator of global climate change.
Although glaciers are a much smaller part of the cryosphere, they
are considered an important diagnostics tool as they respond more
rapidly to changing environmental conditions. In this study the
capability of SAR repeat track interferometry (RTI) using multiple
baseline techniques to provide spatial measurements of instantaneous
ice velocity and also microtopography is being studied. This is
of importance for future measurements of changes of surface elevations
and velocities of glaciers. Also this study is the subject of
an ERS-1/-2 investigation at DCRS.
<P>
<H3>Preliminary Results from Foulum</H3>
<P>
The intensively monitored fields of Research Centre Foulum (RCF)
and the neighbouring Tjele Estate constitute a suitable test site
for DCRS's research in plant and soil as well as aerodynamic
roughness.
<P>
In 1994 EMISAR acquired C-band polarimetric SAR data from the
Foulum area on April 28, June 23, July 29, and August 27. Simultaneous
ground truth observations of surface roughness, soil moisture
etc. were collected, and radar reflectors were deployed in order
to allow the polarimetric calibration of EMISAR to be verified.
<P>
The SAR data have been focused, calibrated and distributed to
the DCRS partners in a full resolution scattering matrix format
and a multi-look gamma nought format. These digital data were
accompanied by hardcopies showing the intensity of the three independent
polarimetric channels in a colour representation. The colour balance
changes radically during the season, and even the effect of irrigation
and fertilisation is visible in the SAR imagery thus proving the
great potential of polarimetric SAR for vegetation monitoring.
<P>
An automatic classification of the SAR imagery has been attempted
by DCRS. Using the concept of polarimetric contrast the pixels
in eight different training fields were classified with a confidence
of 95 to 99 per cent. The classification confidence is significantly
less for fields that are not members of the training set, one
reason being the incidence angle variation. Currently, DCRS is
studying techniques to remedy this effect. So far, the classification
has been based on the July 29 data, but a great improvement is
expected when the classification algorithm is extended to exploit
multi temporal data.
<P>
The aerodynamic roughness (AR) has been measured by anemometers
mounted on a mast deployed at RCF. Initial analyses show a high
seasonal correlation between the AR and the HH channel intensity
of the wheat field beneath the mast.
<P>
<H3>Geology in Greenland</H3>
<P>
The application of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) for Geologic
mapping in Greenland is investigated by the Danish Center for
Remote Sensing (DCRS) in co-operation with the Danish Lithosphere
Centre. A pilot project was conducted in August 1994, where the
Danish airborne polarimetric C-band SAR, EMISAR, acquired data
over a 25 by 25 km area at Kangerdlugssuaq 500 km south west of
Scoresbysund, East Greenland.
<P>
The area was covered by three partly overlapping swaths, and one
swath was mapped from the opposite side as well. Three trihedrals
distributed over the middle swath served as a supplement to EMISAR's
internal calibration facilities. Data was acquired in fully polarimetric
mode, and processed to 2 by 2 m resolution, one-look imagery.
<P>
Due to the extreme topography in the area, major areas are obscured
by shadowing. Other areas are obscured by lay-over and severe
foreshortening, which badly deteriorates the ground resolution
and affects the radiometric calibration  accordingly. However,
in terrains with more gentle topography the internal structures
of lithologies are weathered out and reflected in the SAR images
via the morphology. In the gentle areas dikes and faults in moderate
concentration show up quite well, and areas of gneisses, major
structural elements of gneiss areas, and bedding in lava successions
are readily identified.
<P>
The preliminary results do not indicate much polarimetric information.
The VV/HH intensity ratio is close to unity and fairly constant
over the entire scene. Also, the intensities of the cross-polarised
channels are quite low, typically 10-12 dB below the intensities
of the co-polarised channels. An artifact characterised by high
cross-polarisation is observed behind many of the sharp maintain
rims. Preliminary investigations suggest the phenomenon to be
caused by multi-path propagation.

<b>Erik Lintz Christensen, M.Sc.E.E. '66</b>
<p>
In 1968 he joined the Electromagnetics 
Institute, Technical University of Denmark, where he is now an associate 
professor. His work has covered many aspects of radar, radio communications, 
and high frequency and microwave electronics. This includes the design of 60 
MHz and 300 MHz radars for recording of the thickness of the inland ice of 
Greenland and Antarctica, equipment for measuring amplitude and phase of the 
transfer function of a 50 km line-of-sight radio path at 15 GHz, a system for 
measuring amplitude and phase of antenna near-field patterns.
From 1990 to 1994
he was the project manager of the Danish Airborne SAR program now integrated 
into the Danish Center for Remote Sensing. Since February 1994 he is a 
co-manager of the Danish Center for Remote Sensing.

<h2> Ice information </h2>

DCRS produces daily ice maps from the Greenland Sea region as well as from South- and West-Greenland
waters. The original SSM/I antenna temperature data are supplied by the The <a href="http://wwwdaac.msfc.nasa.gov/daac.html">NASA Earth Observing System, Hydrologic Cycle DAAC</A> at the Global Hydrology & Climate Center, Huntsville, Alabama.

<br>
<li><a href="ftp://www.dcrs.dtu.dk/pub/ssmi/icemaps/yesterday/"> <b>And yesterday's </b></a>images are available as well!

</ul>
Through the Archive you can also get access to our new JAVA image browser that allows you to
zoom into the images, draw related vector information (coastlines and ice concentration contours
of the image and images from previous days).

<h1><center>Ice animations</center></h1>

<center><a  href="/images/movie.mpg"> <IMG SRC="/images/movie.small.gif" border=2></a></center>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

Passive microwave observations of the Polar regions of the Earth provide daily information about the sea ice cover independently of cloud cover and even during the polar night. The development of the ice cover during a winter season may be illustrated by a sequence of images. MPEG animations allows us to view the images in motion, thus allowing the dynamics to be visualized in a new way.
<p>
The images are coded with the Berkeley MPEG encoder running under UNIX (AIX), and may be played back using readily available software. For information of free or shareware MPEG viewers for Machintosh, PC (Windows) and UNIX please refer to <a href="http://www.travelresource.com/help.html">Internet viewers</a>

<h2>Available MPEG animations</h2>

<h3> The central Greenland Sea </h3>

<h4> Note that the files are approximately 1 MByte large each, so they may take a while to download. If your MPEG viewer does not support saving the sequence, it may be a good idea to download the file to your hard disk first, and than view it later. With Netscape this is accomplished by pressing the shift key while clicking with the left mouse button on the selection. </h4>

<H3>Abstract:</H3>
<EM>Passive microwave radiometry has become a popular tool to derive cloud-independent
sea ice information from remote areas in the Arctic.
A number of different algorithms that derives total ice concentration and multi-year
ice fraction from the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) instrument
have been published in the open literature.
5 such algorithms have been implemented and carefully adjusted (tie-point adjustment)
in order to allow for direct intercomparison during a two-month winter period in 1993.
Where necessary, the tiepoints are transformed according to the algorithm atmosphere
correction.
Results of the intercomparison includes algorithm stability, and algorithm sensitivity
to various types of geophysical noise and to instrument noise.

<title>Daily ice edge positions at 75N in the Greenland Sea</title>
</head>

<body>
<h1><center>Ice edge positions</center></h1>
<p>

This page shows x-t plots of daily ice edge positions in the Greenland Sea during each of the winters 1992-1993, 1993-1994 & 1994-1995. The figures are derived by extracting ice concentrations from the daily SSM/I F11 maps of total ice concentration.
<p>Each line corresponds to a line from 25W to 5E, sampled every 0.1 deg. longitude.
<p> Larger versions of the images are available by clicking on the small ones on display
<p>

<h3><center> Daily ice edges, 1992-1993 </center></h3>
<p>
Note the Yellow-green area near the right edge during January to April. This is the last time the Odden ice feature in the Greenland Sea has been observed. (Written on December 16, 1995).
<p>
The upper line corresponds to August 1, and the bottom line to July 31. Gray lines are inserted every month to facilitate reading. Unfortunately, missing data lines are also gray. (Will be fixed later).

<title>Data Analysis System for Remote Sensing Data, abstract</title>
</head>

<body>
<b>Title</b>: Data Analysis System for Remote Sensing Data (abstract)<p>
<b>Authors</b>: Niels J. Bagger, Leif Toudal Pedersen, Henning Skriver, and Preben Gudmandsen<p>
<b>Place</b>: 1st International Symposium about Scientific Imagery and Image Processing, Cannes 1995<p>

  In July 1991 ESA launched the European remote sensing satellite
  ERS-1 which still delivers a large amount of data from its sensors. At
  Electromagnetics Institute (EMI) at the Technical University of Denmark, we
  have used this data along with data from other sources for our scientific
  research of eg.\ sea ice for many years. As a result of these studies, a lot
  of algorithms have been developed to extract information about ice
  concentration, classification, and ice movements.
<p>
  To simplify the analysis process, we are at EMI currently working on a
  project to develop an integrated analysis system, which will enable the user
  to extract information especially from satellite data together with other
  remote sensing data and data from other sources. The user will be able to
  without particular knowledge about the operations of the sensor to extract
  information from the satellite data with the help of advanced applications.
<p>
  The system is constructed of modules, each which handles specific
  tasks. Among the modules are the <i>display module</i> for viewing images,
  the <i>process module</i> for the collection of algorithms eg. filtering,
  segmentation and geometric rectification, and the <i>database module</i>
  for storing and searching for data.
<p>
  Today a prototype of the display module has been developed for the X Window
  System. The display system is especially developed to display images
  containing our own image header. This header contains together with other
  data, information about the projection, which the image has been fitted to,
  enabling the display system to show a wide range of geographical related
  data with the image.

<title>EMI Image Header and I/O System version 3.0</title>
</head>

<body>
<h1>EMI Image Header and I/O System version 3.0</h1>

<b>Sorry</b>, but the user and reference manual has not been ported to
HTML yet, since the report has not yet been finalized.
<p>
The purpose with the EMI Image Header and I/O System is to provide users with
a detailed image header and an easy and uniform programming interface to
remote sensing image files.
<p>
Some of the features of the EMI Header and I/O System are:
<ul>
  <li> Detailed image header containing information about the acqusition, map
       projection, calibration etc. of the image.
  <li> Support of <i>18</i> different image data types, including 8, 16, and
       32 bit integers; 16, 32, and 64 bit floating point; and complex data
       types.
  <li> Programming interface for C++ and FORTRAN that simplifies the file
       input/output.
  <li> Includes interface to other scientific image formats, such as HDF and
       CHIPS.
</ul>
<p>
Until the final version will be available, excerpts from the report is written
below. This gives an <a href="emiheader.html#overview">overview</a> of the system as well as a few <a href="emiheader.html#examples">programming
examples</a>.
<p>
Please feel free to download the <a href="ftp://ms/pub/emiheader/v3/emiheader.doc.tar.gz">draft version</a>, available in PostScript.

<h2><a NAME="overview">Overview of the system</a></h2>
(Excerpts from Chapter 2)
<p>
For the programmer, the header system can be regarded as a black box,
consisting of two units, a function interface unit and a EMI header and file
input/output unit.
<p>
<center>
<img src="fig1.gif">
<p>
<i>Fig 1. <b>Block diagram of the EMI Image Header system</b></i>
</center>
<p>
The third box shown in figure 1 labeled <i>Application code</i>
is the code written by the programmer, the rest is accesible through the
header system library.
<p>
The programmer asks the header system library to perform tasks through
interface functions. These tasks includes
<p>
<ul>
 <li> Open image files
 <li> Read header information
 <li> Read image data
 <li> Create new image files
 <li> Write image data
 <li> Add optional header information
 <li> Perform transformation between rectangular map coordinates and
       geographical coordinates
</ul>
<p>
For each image, the application wants to work with, a block of memory has to
be allocated by the library in order to control access to the image from the
application. The application receives a reference or <i>handle</i> to this
control block, which is used to access this memory space through the interface
functions. This handle is implemented differently when used in C++ and FORTRAN
respectively.
<p>
This implementation makes it possible to reference as many images as the
amount of memory on the computer permits.
<p>
<center>
<A HREF="fig2.eps"><img BORDER=1 src="fig2.gif"></A>
<p>
<i>Fig 2. <b>The image header system in use for reading an existing image A
          and writing a new image B.</b></i>
</center>
<p>
The usage of the image header system is shown in Figure 2. In the
figure, image A already exists on the mass storage, and the application 
wants to read it. The image related information is stored in the header. This
information is read into memory with the interface function <tt>iopen</tt>, which 
also prepares the file for reading and writing of data.
<p>
When the image has been opened, the application can access all the information
through set/get functions, that writes and reads respectively information
between application variables and the memory space controlled by the library.
<p>
There is <i>no</i> direct access to the header information stored in the
library, i.e. the application cannot manipulate the memory controlled by the
library. All access has to go through the interface functions.
<p>
A subset of the image data (or the whole image) can be transferred to an
appropriate data area in the application (data area 1 in
Figure 2). This is done using the reading interface function
<tt>iread</tt>. The read
function can read image data of all 18 supported types: 
<p>
<ul>
 <li> Signed or unsigned 1, 2 or 4 bytes integer,
 <li> 2, 4 or 8 bytes floating point,
 <li> Complex number versions of above mentioned data types.
</ul>
<p>
The data type of the data area are limited to a subset of these data types.
It must be one of the data types supported by the language. See
Table 1 for a reference.
<p>
<center>
<img src="table1.gif">
<p>
<i>Table 1. <b>Valid data types for data areas. Signature: <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="sup.gif"> Supported, <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="polsup.gif"> Supported by the <tt>pol_cmpx</tt> class, and <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="notsup.gif"> Not supported.</b></i>
</center>
<p>
The image B in Figure 2 is a new image that the application
is going to create. In data area 2 the image data that the application has
computed is stored. The application has also computed the image related
information, which is set in the library memory by the interface functions.
Using the interface routine <tt>icreate</tt> the image file B is now
opened and the library memory information is copied into an image header in the
image file.
<p>
A subset of the image data (or all image data) stored in data area 2 can now
be copied into the image file using the interface function <tt>iwrite</tt>. As
 for the reading function
this writing routine can write the image data in all 18 data types to the
image file.
<p>
<a name="examples"><h2>Two C++ examples</a></h2>
(Excerpts from Chapter 5)
<ol>
  <li> This is a very simple <a href="example1.html">example</a> that shows how to open an existing image, and,
depending on the error status, write out some header record values.
  <li> This <a href="example2.html">example</a> creates a new image if it does not exist already.
</ol>

<h1>Addendum to "EMI Image Header and I/O System version 3" report</h1>

This page contains items that has been changed or added to the
<a href="http:/manuals/emiio/emiheader.html">EMI Image Header and I/O System version
3</a> draft report of February 1995.
<p>
Please let <a href="mailto:bbt@emi.dtu.dk">me</a> know, if you find items that
should be changed or added to the report before the final copy
<p>
<hr>
<ol>
  <li> <b>Added a constructor to the <tt>Buffer</tt> template class.</b> (p. 98)<br>
       Two new constructors has been added to the class, which takes a
       <tt>IDim<uint32></tt> dimension value as the first argument.<br>
       <p>
       <dl>
	 <dt> <tt>Buffer(uintDim </tt><i>dim</i><tt>, T*</tt> <i>abuf</i><tt>=NULL);</tt>
	 <dd> The constructor initializes an instance of the class with a
	      buffer of the given dimension <i>dim</i>.
	      <p>
	      If <i>abuf</i> is non-NULL, the buffer data will point to this
	      array. The given array <i>must</i> be large enough to hold
	      <i>dim.l</i> x <i>sim.s</i> x <i>type-size</i> number of bytes,
	      where <i>type-size</i> is the size in bytes of one data element
	      (<tt>T<tt>).
	      <p>
	      If <i>abuf</i> is NULL, a buffer data area will be allocated by
	      the constructor.
	      <p>
	      The internal position pointer will be set to (l,s) = (0,0).
	      <p>
       <dt> <tt>Buffer(uintDim </tt><i>dim</i><tt>, T </tt><i>i_val</i>);
	    <dd> The constructor initializes an instance of the class by
		 allocating a buffer with the given dimensions.
		 <p>
		 The buffer is initialized with <i>i\_val</i> at each position.
		 <p>
		 The internal position pointer will be set to (l,s) = (0,0).
		 <p>
       </dl>
  <li> <b>Corrected the spelling error for the <tt>IDim</tt> type definition.</b> (p. 104)<br>
       The second line of the type definitions should read:
       <p>
         <tt>typedef uintDim IDim&lt;uint32&gt;</tt> Unsigned 32-bit integer
       <p>

When sea water is freezing, it initially forms ice crystals called frazil. 
Frazil develops into an oil-like mixture of ice crystals and sea water, 
which is called grease ice.
In calm conditions, further cooling will form an elastically solid ice cover up to
10 cm thick <A HREF="node61.html#carsey">[Carsey, 1992, p. 10]</A>. This ice cover is known as nilas. 
On the other hand, the presence of wind and waves will form masses of ice, 
which develops circular shapes, when they are bumping together. 
This is called pancake ice, and the individual pancakes normally grow in diameters 
of 30-300 cm <A HREF="node61.html#carsey">[Carsey, 1992, p. 10]</A>.
Slush is formed in the open water areas between the pancakes, and on further freezing, 
the slush consolidates, forming a solid field of pancake ice.<BR>Over time, a consolidated ice cover is referred to as first year ice.
It has a high brine content and generally a smooth surface.
In the subsequent summer melt period, brine drainage reduces the brine concentration,
and a low saline ice with air voids is produced. This is known as multi year ice.

<P>
In the Odden area of the Greenland Sea, a process called convection plays an important
role in ice conditions. 
The cold Polar Water (PW) and the warmer and saltier 
upper Arctic Intermediate Water (uAIW) are the principal water masses involved.
When sea ice is formed at the surface, brine is injected to the upper water layer, which
causes the density to increase. 
The increasing density will eventually convect the upper
water into the under laying water, causing warmer water to be brought up. 
This will decrease or even stop ice formation at the surface. 
If ice formation stops, the density of the upper layer is lowered again,
and the convection will stop. Therefore ice formation can restart.<BR>When convection takes place, current features are formed in the ocean.
The channels in which the upper water is convected down are called plumes, 
while eddies are the consequence of rotating clusters of plumes. 
Plumes are expected to have dimensions of 100-1000 m, 
while eddies are in the range of 5-60 km.<BR>For a further description of convection and related effects, 
see<A HREF="node61.html#johannessen">[Johannessen, 1994, p. 211-221]</A>.

In this section, the signature from active and passive microwave sensors of various
types of sea ice will be explained.
The sensors of primary interest are the passive microwave radiometer on board the 
Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (<A HREF="http://wwwdaac.msfc.nasa.gov:5721/sensor_documents/ssmi_sensor.html">SSM/I</A>) and the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) on 
board the <A HREF="http://gds.esrin.esa.it:80/A1F01400/CERS1.1">ERS-1</A> satellite.

<P>
Satellite based passive microwave radiometers have a coarse spatial resolution of 
approximately 30 to 70 km., and therefore small ice features will not be resolved by 
the antenna footprint.
The only established classification with passive microwave radiometry is into open water, 
first year ice and multi year ice.<BR>The radiometer data are useful for approximately estimating the ice edge position
or the ice concentration.
In the case of large areas with mixtures of pancake ice and open water, it is expected, 
that the passive microwave radiometry can give a coarse estimate of the ice 
concentration.<BR>The used passive microwave radiometer data are from the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager
(<A HREF="http://wwwdaac.msfc.nasa.gov:5721/sensor_documents/ssmi_sensor.html">SSM/I</A>) on the US-DMSP satellites, which gives a daily coverage in the Arctic area.
On every pass of the satellite, data are recorded and written to the corresponding
position in the output file.
Therefore there are no accurate time information on the individual parts of the file,
and the only knowledge is, that the data are recorded on the particular day.

The synthetic aperture radar (SAR) on board the <A HREF="http://gds.esrin.esa.it:80/A1F01400/CERS1.1">ERS-1</A> satellite has a 5.3 GHz
radar frequency and a spatial resolution of approximately 30 m. 
The angle of incidence ranges between <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_43430_tex2html_wrap252.gif"> and <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_43430_tex2html_wrap254.gif">. 
The satellite has been operating since July 1991. 
In the following the appearance of open water, grease ice, new ice and 
pancake ice in SAR images will be explained.

When wind is blowing, the open water areas appears bright in SAR images, 
whereas they are dark in calm weather.
An approximate of the backscatter as function of wind speed and angle of 
incidence can be found by using the CMOD-4 model <A HREF="node61.html#cmod4">[ESA, 1993]</A>.
This is shown in figure <A HREF="node9.html#figwater_backscatter"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/u/emilib/lib/perl/latex2html/icons/cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>.

Grease ice forms on the lee side of features if water and air temperatures are below
freezing. 
It appears dark in SAR images, and it has a texture known as wavy.
In the presence of ocean currents or local winds, grease ice is expected to form patterns 
similar to those of open water.

Nilas is a subsequent evolvement of grease ice.
It appears dark in SAR images, and it has little or no texture of significance. 
When the wind speed is low, it can be difficult to separate areas with open water

The development of new ice in uncalm conditions normally forms pancake ice.
Because the pancakes are smaller than the spatial resolution, the backscatter will
be given by the integrated contribution from the individual pancakes and the 
surroundings.
The appearance of pancake ice is therefore varying with the density of pancakes and
the conditions of the surroundings.<BR>Wind will often push the pancakes together in long bands, and an example of pancake
ice is shown in figure <A HREF="node13.html#figpancake"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/u/emilib/lib/perl/latex2html/icons/cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>.<BR><P><A NAME=65>&#160;</A><A NAME=figpancake>&#160;</A><A HREF="_43430_figure62-large.jpg"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_43430_figure62.gif"></A>

In February 1993 <A HREF="node61.html#wadhams">[Wadhams and Viehoff, 1993]</A> have observed, that the ice in the Odden area consists
of dense pancake ice.
They have further concluded, that pancake ice and frazil are the primary ice types in 
the Odden area during winter.

<P>
Convection makes the ocean form local currents, indicated by eddies and plumes.
When the ocean is covered with grease ice or pancake ice,
these patterns can sometimes be seen in SAR images.
An example of convection created ocean currents is shown in figure <A HREF="node14.html#figpattern"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/u/emilib/lib/perl/latex2html/icons/cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>.

<P>
Weather effects are important for ice formation.
Measurements from the island Jan Mayen, which is placed near the Odden area, is
used as an indicator for the weather in the Odden area.
This will only give an approximately knowledge of the weather conditions at the
Odden area.
In several occasions it has been observed, that the wind direction measured
at Jan Mayen is in bad agreement with the wind direction in the Odden area 
estimated from satellite images.
The measured data have been delivered by the Norwegian Meteorological Institute 
<A HREF="node61.html#NMI">[NMI, 1993]</A>.<BR>The temperature in January and February 1993 is shown in figure <A HREF="node15.html#figjan_temp"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/u/emilib/lib/perl/latex2html/icons/cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>

In the upper and lower parts of the SAR image, bright homogeneous areas are recognized 
as wind blown open water. 
In these areas, also dark features are present, which is probably open water
with less wind influence, new ice or grease ice. 
These areas appear as open water in the SSM/I image.<BR>In the central right hand side of the SAR image, a mixture of dark/bright circular
patterns are present.
These patterns are probably related to ocean currents, and perhaps caused by convection
phenomena.
This area is assumed to consist of open water or grease ice, together with a low 
concentration of pancake ice.
The pancakes form the bright lines while the water or grease ice forms the dark parts.<BR>In the central left hand side, a bright area with some darker features are seen.
The bright areas are probably wind blown open water, while the darker parts are either
grease ice or a low concentration of pancake ice.
The SSM/I image shows, that some ice can be present in this area.

Most of the SAR image is covered with bright areas, and only thin dark bands
are present between the bright parts.
The bright parts are wind blown open water, while the dark bands are collections
of pancake ice. 
This can also be confirmed in the SSM/I image, where all parts are
covered with a low ice concentration.
The pancake ice bands appear homogeneous in the SAR image, which indicates, that
they are caused by a big number of small ice floes; smaller than the spatial resolution.

The SAR image is very similar to the image from January 8. 
This one is also covered with open water and pancake ice, but here the ice 
concentration is bigger, and the ice bands are broader.

The SAR image has a dark feature in the image center and a bright appearance elsewhere.
The bright areas are wind blown open water, whereas the dark area is young smooth ice
or a dense concentration of pancake ice.
By comparing the SSM/I images from January 14 and January 15, it is seen, that the ice
is created during the 15'th.
The wind at the island Jan Mayen on January 15 is 8m/s <A HREF="node61.html#NMI">[NMI, 1993]</A>, which indicates,
that formation of pancake ice is likely.
In the SAR image, the ice has almost no texture except for a bright line along the 
northern ice edge, and a few very dark features in the ice.
At the ice edge some bands of new ice are seen, and the whole ice area is expected
to consist of pancake ice with slightly varying ice concentrations.

The SSM/I image shows, that open water areas are present in the upper part and in lower 
right corner of the image.<BR>In the SAR image, the upper open water area is easy recognized, but in the lower right 
corner, it is more difficult. 
A big very dark area is seen, and to the right of this, a few brighter strips are 
present. 
These strips are probably open water.
The water strips are brighter than the dark area, and therefore the dark area is 
interpreted to be either grease ice, very thin new ice or open water with very little
wind influence.
From the wind measurements at Jan Mayen it is known, that the average
wind speed on 18 January is 5m/s, and with this low wind, open water can have a dark
signature.<BR>In the central part of the image, a grey background with dark circular patterns is seen.
The grey background is probably a dense concentration of pancake ice, while the dark 
patterns probably are new ice. 
The circular shapes are probably created by ocean currents, which perhaps are caused
by convection.
By comparing the SSM/I images from January 18 and January 16 it is seen, that new ice
is formed in the area.

In the SAR image, the upper bright part is easyly recognized as open water. 
Also in the lower right corner, open water is present.
In the central part, a dark background with some bright spots is seen.
The dark background is probably a high concentration of pancake ice, while the bright 
spots are open water between the ice.
A few very dark features are seen in the left hand side, which are recognized as
being new ice.
By comparison with the SSM/I image, good agreement is found.

The SAR image shows open water in the upper right and in the lower right of the image.
This is in good agreement with the SSM/I image.
Along the northern ice edge is new dark ice formed in long bands.
In the central part of the SAR image, a grey background with some open
water areas is seen.
The grey background is probably pancake ice with different concentrations of open 
water in between.
The brighter lines in this part is found to be areas with a lower ice concentration.

The SAR image shows, that the upper part of the image is wind blown open water, while
the lower right corner contains a small amount of ice.
At the northern ice edge, new ice is formed in long narrow bands.
In the lower right part of the image, the ice consists of pancake ice in different 
concentrations.
Also open water areas are present in this part.
All along the left hand side of the image, small bands of ice features are seen, and
this is also pancake ice.

In the SAR image, open water is seen in the top part of the image, along the left hand
side and in the lower right hand side of the image.
This is in good agreement with the SSM/I image.<BR>The SAR image shows, that new ice is formed along the western and the northern ice edge.
These areas appears as black bands of new ice.
In all of the central parts of the image, the SSM/I data shows, that considerable 
amounts of ice is present.
This ice appears grey in the SAR image, and it consists basicly of pancake ice.
The water between the pancakes is perhaps frozen, so it forms a solid field of pancake 
ice.

In the SSM/I image it is seen, that the SAR frame is entirely placed into the ice.
This is also seen in the SAR image, where there are no obvious open water 
areas present.
The homogeneous area in the left hand side is a consolidated ice area.<BR>In the central part, some wavy dark patterns are seen, and this is probably new ice
or open water.
The wind at Jan Mayen is low (5m/s) <A HREF="node61.html#NMI">[NMI, 1993]</A>, and the open water can therefore
have a dark signature.
By comparing the SSM/I images in the last few days it is seen, that the ice in this
part of the image is formed during the last 2-3 days.
It is therefore difficult to determine if the dark areas are open water or new ice.<BR>In the right hand side of the image, the patterns appears more grey than in the 
central part.
This can be caused by a mixture of pancake ice and open water.

The SAR image shows, that open water is present in the upper left corner and in the
lower right corner.
In all of the central image, a grey background with some dark features are present.
The grey background can be formed by a mixture of pancake ice and open water.
The dark features are probably new ice or grease ice formed in calm conditions.
On January 27 the wind speed at Jan Mayen <A HREF="node61.html#NMI">[NMI, 1993]</A> is 5m/s, and at a weak wind like
this, new smooth ice can be formed.

The SAR image shows open water with some formed bands of new ice in the upper left 
corner.
Open water is also present in the lower right corner.
In the central part of the image, consolidated ice with some open water areas
are seen.
The open water appears bright, while the ice is mostly dark.
The dark ice indicates, that the ice concentrations is quite high, and if the area
is covered by pancake ice, the individual pancakes are close together.

In the SAR image, some very dark areas are seen in the upper left corner.
By comparing the SSM/I images on February 1 and January 31, new ice is seen to be 
formed in this area (the upper left corner in the SAR image is the left most corner 
in the SSM/I image).
To the right of this new ice, a dark gray homogeneous area is seen, and again by comparison
with the SSM/I image, this is recognized as open water.
Below and in between the new ice, are some brighter areas with patterns seen.
This is probably a mixture of pancake ice and open water.
These patterns are formed in circular shapes, which probably is related to ocean currents.

The SAR image shows clearly open water in the upper part of the image, while ice is 
present in the lower.
Along the northern and western ice edge, very dark thin lines are created,
which is probably due to development of new ice.
On the western side of the ice covered part, are some open water areas present.
The central part of the ice covered area contains some bright structures.
The ice is interpreted to consist of a dense concentrations of pancake ice, only with a
small amount of open water between the pancakes.
The bright structures are probably created by the small water content.

The SAR image is seen to be dominated by open water.
In the top part of the image, pancake ice with only a few open water regions are present.
In all the central part, open water and bands of pancake ice is dominating.
In the lower left corner, a bigger area of ice is seen.
This area is also assumed to be formed by pancake ice.
All of this is in good agreement with the SSM/I image (the upper 3 frames).

In the SAR image, the upper left and lower right corners are recognized as open water.
This is also seen in the SSM/I image.//
<P>
By comparing the SSM/I images from February 6 and February 5 it is seen, that the
ice is primarily formed during the 6'th.
The SAR image shows circular patterns in all the central parts of the image.
These patterns are probably formed by ocean currents, and perhaps as a consequence
of ocean convection.
In the upper part of this area, there is a very good contrast between the dark background
and the bright foreground.
The dark part is expected to consist of either open water or grease ice, while the
bright part is expected to be pancake ice.
The ocean current will form bands of pancakes, which creates the bright bands on the
dark background.<BR>In the lower part of the image, the contrast between the dark background and the bright
foreground is blured. 
This is perhaps caused by less current influence, which makes the pancakes spread,
and therefore forming a more homogeneous area.
Also, if the wind is stronger in this area, the open water between the pancakes will 
have a stronger backscatter.
In the lower part are ocean waves recognized in several positions.

In the lower single SAR frame from February 7, the image is divided in a bright and
a dark area. 
The upper part is bright, and it consists basicly of open water.
This can also be seen in the SSM/I image.
In the upper right corner a dark structure is seen, which is probably new ice.
Also a few grey circular patterns are seen in the open water, and this is perhaps grease
ice or pancake ice.
The lower part of the image appears dark.
The sharp division between the bright and dark parts are perhaps created by an oceanic
front.
The grey circular patterns from the bright part are seen to extend down in the dark part.
These patterns are probably formed by convection created ocean currents.
The dark background in the lower part of the image is perhaps open water with different
dielectric properties compared to the upper part.
Also some new ice can exist in this area.

The upper 3 SAR frames from February 7 shows a very dark area in the upper right corner,
which looks like new ice.
This appears as open water in the SSM/I image.
In the upper part of the SAR image, two different areas looks like open water, although 
they have a slightly different appearance.
A very thin line of new ice is seen in the junction between the two.
The lower area could be grease ice.
Further down in the image, circular patterns are seen, which is related to ocean 
currents and convection.
The patterns are dark on a grey background, and they are perhaps formed by new ice.
The background can consist of pancake ice in different concentrations.
In the lower part of the image, a grey homogeneous area is seen.
This is probably formed be a dense concentration of pancake ice.

In the upper frame of the SAR image, a big dark area of new formed ice is present.
The rest of this frame contains open water.<BR>The lower frame has a rough appearance, with a grey background and with some dark 
features.
The background is probably mixtures of open water and pancake ice, while the dark
features are new ice.

The SAR image shows, that open water is present in the upper left and in the lower
right corner.
In the central image, special rough-looking ice types are seen.
A few bright areas are also seen in this area, and this is open water.
Some grey contours are seen, which is probably mixtures of pancake ice and open 
water.
On the south side of these features, dark new formed ice is seen.
The almost homogeneous grey background is probably formed by mixtures of pancake ice 
and open water.

The top 3 frames in the SAR image has open water in the upper part of the image.
At the ice edge bands of new ice are formed.
Below the ice edge is a small area with a high ice concentration of pancake ice.
This area is basicly dark.
Further down the image, the left hand side has a bright background, which is open water.
The foreground is dark features of pancake ice.
In the right hand side, the background is dark, and it consists of pancake ice and open
water.
The foreground in the right hand side is bright features with open water.
On the east side of these open water areas, new ice is seen to be formed.

The lower 3 frames in the SAR image shows open water in the lower right corner.
Next to this open water is a dark area, which is expected to be dominated by new
ice.
The rest of the image is the same as in part (1) from February 10.

The upper 3 frames on February 13 contains open water in the upper part.
Also some dark bands of new formed ice is seen in this part of the image.
At the lower right hand side, the grey background is probably containing open water
and/or pancake ice. 
This part appears almost as bright as the open water.
At the junction to the open water, new ice is formed.

The lower 3 frames on February 13 has open water in the lower left corner.
In the right hand side of the lower part, the dark features are expected to be new ice,
while the grey area is a low concentration of pancake ice.
The rest of the image is as the upper 3 frames on February 13.

The SSM/I image shows that open water is present in the upper left of the image.
In the SAR image, open water is only recognized in the very upper part.
Beneath the open water is a very dark area, which is probably new ice.
The wind at Jan Mayen on February 14 is 9m/s, which would give open water a brighter
appearance compared to the very dark area.
Also in the rest of the image are some very dark features, which are also new ice.
Outside the very dark parts are mixtures of pancake ice and open water seen to 
exist.

The SAR image shows open water in the upper and right parts of the image.
The rest is ice covered.
The ice is expected to consist of a dense concentration of pancake ice, with only
a few open water areas in between.
Some brighter features are seen in the central image, and they are areas with less
ice concentration.
At the south side of these areas, new ice is developed.
Also along the northern ice edge are new ice seen to be formed.

In the upper 3 SAR frames, open water is clearly present in the upper left hand side.
Also in the lower left corner is open water seen.
This is in good agreement with the SSM/I image.
Along the ice edge long bands of very dark new ice are formed.
In the central part and right hand side of the image the ice concentration is quite high.
There is a dark background of almost consolidated pancake ice, and only with a 
few brighter areas with a significant water content.
There are also some very dark features of new ice.

In the lower 3 SAR frames, open water is seen in the upper left hand side and in the
lower right corner.
At the western ice edge, new ice is formed in bands.
The background in the ice covered part is grey with some bright bands, which indicates,
that the background is formed by pancake ice with a significant water content.
In the lower part of the ice covered area, some dark features are seen.
This is probably new ice, which also can be confirmed by comparing the SSM/I images from 
February 16 and February 15.

The SAR image shows open water in the upper right corner.
New ice is seen to be formed along the ice edge.
In the rest of the image, a grey background with some dark features is seen.
The grey background is pancake ice and water, while the dark
features are new ice.
The formation of new ice can also be seen in the SSM/I images, where there is a 
development from February 16 to February 18.

In the upper 3 SAR frames, open water is clearly seen in the top of the image.
Also in the central part are almost homogeneous areas interpreted as open
water.
Around the open water areas are some very dark parts, which is seen to be new ice.
This can be confirmed by comparing the SSM/I images from February 19 and February 17.
In the right hand side and in the lower part of the image, is a grey background with
some dark features seen.
The grey background is expected to be pancake ice with some water content.
The dark features are probably new developed ice.

In the lower 3 SAR frames on February 19, an area of open water is seen in the central
left hand side, and extending out to the right.
Dark areas with new ice are especially seen in the upper part of the image, but also
a few in the lower part are seen.
The grey background in all of the image is a mixture of pancake ice and open water.

In the 3 SAR frames to the east, open water is seen in the upper right corner and in
the lower right hand side of the image.
At the northern ice edge are some new ice created.
In the central part is the ice covered area very homogeneous, and it exists 
of a high concentration of pancake ice.
In the upper part of the image are some dark features seen, which is new ice in between 
the pancake ice.

In the lower left corner are some small dark bands of new formed ice.
The background in all the ice covered parts are grey, and it is expected to consist
of a dense pancake ice cover.

In the upper part of the image dark areas are classified as new ice.
A small area in the upper left corner appears as open water.
In all parts of the image dark features are seen, which are expected to be new ice.
In the upper part the background is brighter than in the lower part, and
the ice cover is assumed to consist of pancake ice with a decreasing water content 
further down the image.

In most parts of the SAR image bright open water is dominating.
Only in the central right hand side is a significant ice covered area present.
The ice is quite dark, and it is expected to be a dense concentration of pancake ice.
Between the ice are greater open water areas present.

In the SAR image is open water clearly present in the upper part.
The rest contains a dark background with bright open water areas in 
the foreground.
The temperature is above zero at Jan Mayen, and the ice can have a wet surface.
The background is therefore assumed to contain a high concentration of melting 
pancake ice.

The SAR image shows only a few bands of pancake ice within the open water.
Even though the temperature on February 24 is very low, the SSM/I image shows,
that the ice is melting away.

The SSM/I image shows, that ice is only present in the upper left corner,
while the rest contains open water.
Some dark patterns are seen in the open water areas, and this is expected to be 
bands of pancake ice.

<P>
In this report the ice conditions in the Odden area have been discussed, primarily on
the basis of <A HREF="http://gds.esrin.esa.it:80/A1F01400/CERS1.1">ERS-1</A> Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images.
Meteorological data and passive microwave radiometer measurements from the Special Sensor
Microwave/Imager (<A HREF="http://wwwdaac.msfc.nasa.gov:5721/sensor_documents/ssmi_sensor.html">SSM/I</A>) satellites have been used for comparizon.<BR>It has been shown, that the ice conditions in the Odden area in a period of January and
February 1993 is very complex. The principal ice types are new ice, formed as either nilas or
grease ice, and pancake ice in various concentrations.<BR>Convection created ocean currents have been observed, and they appear most clearly in the case
of a pancake ice and water mixture.<BR>

<h2><center>European Subpolar Ocean Project phase 2 under MAST-III</center></h2>
<center>ESOP-2 is an EEC project under the MAST III programme, contract MAS3-CT95-0015</center>
<h2>Overall project description </h2>

The goal of <a href="http://www.smr.uib.no/">ESOP-2 </a>is to understand the thermohaline circulation in the
Greenland Sea, its sensitivity, and impact on global ocean circulation,
building on a unique combination of novel experimental
techniques, modelling and experience gained under ESOP-1.
<br>

<h3>Role and contribution of DTU (DCRS)</h3>
The Danish Center for Remote Sensing contributes with large scale ice mapping in the Greenland Sea
based on passive microwave information, and with detailed studies of the ice formation and decay in
the Odden area based on Active and Passive microwave observations.

Sea ice affects the climate as sea ice extent and type are important
parameters in determining the transport of heat and humidity from
the ocean to the atmosphere. Data from active and passive microwave
sensors contain information about sea ice that is not available
from other sources. In order to make better use of microwave remote
sensing techniques for monitoring sea ice conditions, it is necessary
to have detailed information about microwave signatures of major
types of sea ice.


<center><h2>Sea Ice observations</h2></center>
<P>
DCRS takes part in a number of national and International projects where remote sensing
in general and microwave remote sensing in particular is used as a tool for monitoring
sea ice.

Different algorithms for retrieving ice concentration from multichannel microwave
radiometer measurements have evolved since the early eighties.
These algorithms often differ in the channel selection and the way to handle geophysical
influence, which represents effects like temperature, wind, water vapor etc.<BR>Here, a total of 5 radiometer algorithms are compared on real microwave radiometer data.
The algorithms cover the most widely used algorithms in literature, which includes AES 
<A HREF="node17.html#swift">[Swift et al., 1985]</A>, NORSEX <A HREF="node17.html#svendsen">[Svendsen et al., 1983]</A>, COMISO <A HREF="node17.html#comiso">[Comiso, 1986]</A> and NASA <A HREF="node17.html#gloersen">[Gloersen and Cavalieri, 1986]</A>.
They differ in the selection of channels, and the way they account for the 
atmosphere.
The individual channels will be identified by the frequency in GHz and the 
polarization as V or H for vertical or horizontal, e.g., 37H identifies the channel
with horizontal polarization and a frequency of 37GHz.<BR>The COMISO algorithm is used with the 37V and 37H channels, in which case it is 
called the COMPOL algorithm, whereas it is called COMFREQ, when the channels are 37V 
and 19V.
The data are recorded on the US-DMSP Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I)
program, processed into brightness temperature grids and delivered on CD-roms by 
<A HREF="node17.html#NSIDC">[NSIDC]</A>.
The algorithms are tested for the total ice concentration (C) and the multi-year ice
fraction given by
<P><A NAME=equationF>&#160;</A><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_35212_equation16.gif"><P>
where <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_35212_tex2html_wrap822.gif"> is the multi-year ice fraction and <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_35212_tex2html_wrap824.gif"> is the amount of multi-year ice.
Mean values and standard deviations of the ice concentration and multi-year ice
fraction are used in this comparison.

This is a two channel algorithm proposed by <A HREF="node17.html#swift">[Swift et al., 1985]</A>.
The algorithm models the atmosphere through a linear transformation from satellite 
measured antenna temperatures to ground estimated emissivities:
<P><A NAME=equationAES>&#160;</A><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_35212_equation48.gif"><P>
where <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_35212_tex2html_wrap844.gif"> is the emissivity, <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_35212_tex2html_wrap858.gif"> is the antenna temperature, <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_35212_tex2html_wrap848.gif"> is the

the total atmospheric opacity and <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_35212_tex2html_wrap854.gif"> is the temperature at the surface.
<P>
In order to make the algorithm work properly, the satellite measured tie-points 
(brightness temperatures) have to be transformed to ground emissivities, using
this linear transformation.
The algorithm uses the channels 37V and 19H.

<P>
<A NAME=algorithmNORSEX>&#160;</A>
The NORSEX algorithm is proposed by <A HREF="node17.html#svendsen">[Svendsen et al., 1983]</A>.
The algorithm estimates an effective emissivity at the surface through a linear 
transformation:
<P><A NAME=equationNORSEX>&#160;</A><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_35212_equation57.gif"><P>
where <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_35212_tex2html_wrap856.gif"> is the effective brightness temperature at the surface, <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_35212_tex2html_wrap858.gif"> is the 
antenna temperature, <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_35212_tex2html_wrap860.gif"> is the weighted average atmospheric temperature,
<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_35212_tex2html_wrap868.gif"> is the total atmospheric opacity, <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_35212_tex2html_wrap848.gif"> is the temperature from free space
and <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_35212_tex2html_wrap866.gif"> is a constant close to unity.
<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_35212_tex2html_wrap868.gif"> is a function of frequency, but not of polarization.
<P>
By measuring the antenna temperature in two different channels (37V and 19V), 
equations <A HREF="node4.html#equationunity">2</A> and <A HREF="node4.html#equationbrightness">3</A> can be used to calculate
<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_35212_tex2html_wrap826.gif">, <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_35212_tex2html_wrap824.gif"> and <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_35212_tex2html_wrap874.gif">.
The calculated results are:
<P><A NAME=equationNORSEXfw>&#160;</A><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_35212_equation77.gif"><P>
<P><A NAME=equationNORSEXfmy>&#160;</A><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_35212_equation99.gif"><P>
where
<P><A NAME=equationNORSEXd>&#160;</A><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_35212_equation120.gif"><P>
and where <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_35212_tex2html_wrap876.gif"> is the physical temperature of ice, <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_35212_tex2html_wrap878.gif"> is the physical
temperature of water and <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_35212_tex2html_wrap880.gif"> is the emissivity of surface type x in channel y.
<P>
When the satellite measured tie-points are transformed through the atmosphere model
given by <A HREF="node6.html#equationNORSEX">equation 5</A>, some observations apply.
By looking careful at equations <A HREF="node6.html#equationNORSEXfw">6</A> through <A HREF="node6.html#equationNORSEXd">8</A> it is seen, that all products are formed by a difference between the 2 terms.
Each term includes the atmosphere correction at the same frequency, and therefore the
constant added to <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_35212_tex2html_wrap858.gif"> in the nominator of <A HREF="node6.html#equationNORSEX">equation 5</A>  will have no effect.
Further, since all products are formed by factors at 37GHz and 19GHz,
the denominator in <A HREF="node6.html#equationNORSEX">equation 5</A>  appears in both the
nominator and denominator in equations <A HREF="node6.html#equationNORSEXfw">6</A>  and <A HREF="node6.html#equationNORSEXfmy">7</A>. Therefore it can be reduced, and equations <A HREF="node6.html#equationNORSEXfw">6</A>  and <A HREF="node6.html#equationNORSEXfmy">7</A>  will produce the same results weather all or none of the 
measured brightness temperatures are transformed through the atmosphere.<BR>The approach taken is to transform all brightness temperatures.

The Comiso algorithm is explained by <A HREF="node17.html#comiso">[Comiso, 1986]</A>.
The algorithm is working directly on satellite measured brightness temperatures, 
and it uses two channels.
The ice concentration is given by <A HREF="node17.html#comiso">[Comiso, 1986]</A>
<P><A NAME=equationcomisoC>&#160;</A><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_35212_equation182.gif"><P>

<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_35212_tex2html_wrap888.gif"> is the water tie-point and <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_35212_tex2html_wrap890.gif"> is a calculated brightness temperature
of ice.
<A HREF="node7.html#equationcomisoC">Formula 9</A>  can be extended to calculate the multi-year ice fraction:

ice and first-year ice tie-points, respectively.<BR>The algorithm can use either the (37V,37H) or the (37V,19V) channels, and in the
former case, the algorithm is called polarization based Comiso algorithm (COMPOL).

This algorithm is equal to the polarization based Comiso algorithm from the
<A HREF="node7.html">previous section</A>, except that it is using the (37V,19V) channels, and it is 
therefore called the frequency based Comiso algorithm (COMFREQ).
It is using the same channels as the  
<A HREF="node6.html">NORSEX algorithm </A>, and in the case, where the linear transformation is applied 
to the tie-points in the NORSEX algorithm, the COMFREQ and NORSEX algorithms produces
the same results, since they both solves the same three equations with the same three
unknowns.

of the same algorithm <A HREF="node17.html#cavalieri">[Cavalieri and Gloersen, 1984]</A>.
It uses the satellite data to calculate two ratios: the polarization ratio (PR) and 
the spectral gradient ratio (GR):

By going through daily processed ice maps it has been observed, that the 
ice conditions in the three areas hardly change in a period of January and 
February 1993.
This suggests, that the ice conditions are fairly constant, and the tie-points
can be chosen to the mean antenna temperature in the two-month period.
Hereby it is assumed, that only one ice type is present in each area, which can't
be verified by the SSM/I data.
<P>
In the period of January and February 1993, the mean brightness temperature
in the three areas have have been calculated in each of the four used channels.
The obtained results are shown in <A HREF="node10.html#tabletiepoints">Table 1</A>. <P><A NAME=271>&#160;</A><A NAME=tabletiepoints>&#160;</A><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_35212_table258.gif">

The areas are chosen so all combinations of open water (W) multi-year ice (MY)
and first-year ice (FY) are present.
The area selection is based on knowledge by the author, in which areas the different

The method of using real radiometer data from different areas does not guarantee, 
that only the expected ice types are present in the areas, but it gives the

The total mean ice concentration has been calculated for the 7 areas and the 5
algorithms. 
The period is January and February 1993, and the results are shown in 
<A HREF="node12.html#tabletotaliceconcentration">Table 2</A>. <P><A NAME=757>&#160;</A><A NAME=tabletotaliceconcentration>&#160;</A><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_35212_table311.gif">

It is seen, that all the algorithms are unbiased, i.e. the ice concentration in the W,
MY and FY areas are calculated close to the expected values of 0%, 
100% and 100%.
Deviations on the first decimal are caused by the finite precision (1 decimal) of 
the used SSM/I brightness temperatures.
In all other areas, the exact ice concentration is unknown, but it is seen, that all
algorithms give results within 2% of each other.<BR>The daily ice concentrations in the tie-point areas are plotted in Figure

<P>
<P>
In <A HREF="node12.html#figwjanfeb93">Figure 5</A>,  the ice concentration in the open
water area is shown.
From the figure it is clear, that the COMPOL algorithm has much more variance than
the other algorithms.
This is also evident in <A HREF="node12.html#tablestandarddeviationoniceconcentration">Table 3</A>. All curves are having the same shape, with the only difference being the variance from
the 0% ice line.
If it is assumed, that the open water area is actually ice free in the period, the
standard deviation on the ice concentration shows, which influence the geophysical 
parameters have.
In <A HREF="node17.html#pedersen">[Pedersen., 1991, p. 90]</A> it is concluded, that the most important geophysical 
parameters in open water areas are cloud liquid water, water vapor and wind speed.
The higher frequency channels are more sensitive to these geophysical changes, and
this is probably the reason for the bad performance of the COMPOL algorithm in this 
case.<BR><A HREF="node12.html#figmyjanfeb93">Figure 6</A> shows the ice concentration in the
multi-year ice area.
All curves are well correlated, and no algorithm produces results outside a 
<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_35212_tex2html_wrap904.gif"> 8% wide range around the expected 100% ice cover.
In the figures it can be seen, that the NORSEX/COMFREQ algorithms, in several occasions
responds opposite to changing geophysical influence than the other algorithms,
i.e. that the ice concentration is decreasing in the NORSEX/COMFREQ algorithms
while it is increasing in the others.
This is not observed in the open water case.
Again the COMPOL algorithm has the biggest standard deviation 
(<A HREF="node12.html#tablestandarddeviationoniceconcentration">Table 3</A> ), but it is not as bad as in
the open water case.
<A HREF="node17.html#pedersen">[Pedersen., 1991, p. 92]</A> concludes, that
the important geophysical parameters in a 
multi-year ice area are cloud liquid water and ice temperature.<BR>The first-year ice curves are shown in <A HREF="node12.html#figfyjanfeb93">Figure 7</A>. Again all curves are well correlated, but the variance through the period is almost
<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_35212_tex2html_wrap904.gif"> 15%.
The NORSEX/COMFREQ algorithms have an opposite response in the beginning of
the period.
In <A HREF="node17.html#pedersen">[Pedersen., 1991, p. 91]</A> it is given, that the most important geophysical parameters in
first-year ice areas are cloud liquid water and ice/air temperature.
This is the same parameters as in the multi-year ice case, and the bigger variation 
in the ice concentration is probably caused by changing ice conditions in the period or
changing cloud liquid water near the ice edge.
<P>
<A HREF="node12.html#tablestandarddeviationoniceconcentration">Table 3</A>  shows the standard deviation
in the period, and overall, it ranges between 1.2% and 11.0%.
It is seen, that the COMPOL algorithm always has the greatest standard deviation.
This is probably caused by the channel selection in the COMPOL algorithm, which only 
uses channels at the 37GHz frequency, which is more sensitive to the geophysical
influence than the lower frequencies.
The other four algorithms have very similar standard deviations in the different areas.
It has to be stressed, that the standard deviations are influenced by changing
ice conditions in the two-month period, and the results are therefore only suitable
for comparison with other algorithms in the same area and period.
Furthermore, it can't be concluded, that the algorithm with the lowest standard 
deviation is the most precise.
Maybe it just can't follow rapid changes in ice conditions.<BR><BR> <HR><A NAME=tex2html197 HREF="node13.html"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="next" SRC="/u/emilib/lib/perl/latex2html/icons/next_motif.gif"></A> <A NAME=tex2html195 HREF="node11.html"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="up" SRC="/u/emilib/lib/perl/latex2html/icons/up_motif.gif"></A> <A NAME=tex2html189 HREF="node11.html"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="previous" SRC="/u/emilib/lib/perl/latex2html/icons/previous_motif.gif"></A> <A NAME=tex2html199 HREF="node1.html"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="contents" SRC="/u/emilib/lib/perl/latex2html/icons/contents_motif.gif"></A>  <BR>

<A NAME=sectionF>&#160;</A>
The multi-year ice fraction is calculated for all algorithms given in the
<A HREF="node4.html">previous sections</A>.  From <A HREF="node2.html#equationF">equation 1</A> it is seen, that the multi-year ice fraction is undefined,
when the ice concentration is zero.
Most areas shown in <A HREF="node11.html#figareas">Figure 4</A>  contains some open water parts, in which the
multi-year ice fraction is undefined.
Because the multi-year ice fraction is non-linear, the mean value has to be calculated
as the average over the individual pixels, so the approach taken here, is to only use 
pixels with ice concentrations larger than 30% in the calculation of the multi-year
ice fraction.
Therefore the open water area has been completely left out.
The mean multi-year ice fraction in January and February 1993 is shown in 
<A HREF="node13.html#tablemultiyearicefraction">Table 4</A> <P><A NAME=772>&#160;</A><A NAME=tablemultiyearicefraction>&#160;</A><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_35212_table440.gif">

Also the daily multi-year ice fractions in the tie-point areas are plotted in Figure 
<A HREF="node13.html#figFmyjanfeb93">8</A>  and <A HREF="node13.html#figFfyjanfeb93">9</A>.<BR>

<P>
In <A HREF="node13.html#tablemultiyearicefraction">Table 4</A>  it is seen, that in the MY and FY 
areas, the average multi-year ice fraction is very close to the expected values 
(100% and  0%) for all algorithms.
However, Figure <A HREF="node13.html#figFmyjanfeb93">8</A>  and <A HREF="node13.html#figFfyjanfeb93">9</A>  shows, that there are
big variations in both the MY and FY areas.
These variations, which are almost equal in all algorithms, are likely to be caused
by changing ice conditions in the period or geophysical influence with the same effect
in all algorithms.<BR>In the other areas, the exact multi-year ice fraction is unknown, but the two-month
average values are seen to differ less than 6% between the algorithms 
(<A HREF="node13.html#tablemultiyearicefraction">Table 4</A> ).
In the W/FY area, all algorithms gives negative values, which indicates, that the 
calculation of the multi-year ice fraction is in error.
Also in the W/MY area the values are less than the expected 100%, and it seems 
like all algorithms underestimate the multi-year ice fraction in these areas.<BR>In the W/MY case, some first-year ice at the junction between open water and
consolidated ice may cause the underestimation.
This is tried avoided by making the area narrow around the ice-water junction, but
perhaps this has not been successful.
In the W/FY case, variations in the first-year ice signature may give rice to an
overestimation of the first-year ice content, and hence an underestimation of the
multi-year ice fraction.
The change in signature can be caused by the small distance to the open water areas,
where the geophysical influence is bigger than over consolidated ice.
<P>
The standard deviation on the multi-year ice fraction is given in 
<A HREF="node13.html#tablestandarddeviationonmultiyearicefraction">Table 5</A>. <P><A NAME=780>&#160;</A><A NAME=tablestandarddeviationonmultiyearicefraction>&#160;</A><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_35212_table506.gif">
<BR><STRONG>Table 5</STRONG> Standard deviation on multi-year ice fraction in January and February 1993 
(in %)<BR>
<P>
It is seen, that the standard deviations on the multi-year ice fraction are similar
in all algorithms and areas, and that it overall ranges between 7.6%
and 17.5%.
The main contributor to these rather large standard deviations are again believed to 
be changing ice or geophysical conditions in the period.
The biggest standard deviation is again found in the COMPOL algorithm.

<P>
This section will investigate, how sensitive the algorithms are to changing physical 
temperature of the ice.
The simple linear equation between physical temperature and brightness temperature
is given by
<P><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_35212_equation529.gif"><P>
where <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_35212_tex2html_wrap908.gif"> is the brightness temperature, <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_35212_tex2html_wrap909.gif"> is the emissivity and <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_35212_tex2html_wrap910.gif">
is the physical temperature.
Assuming that the emissivity is independent on temperature, a change in physical ice 
temperature of <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_35212_tex2html_wrap911.gif"> corresponds to a change in
brightness temperature of
<P><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_35212_equation531.gif"><P>
where <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_35212_tex2html_wrap912.gif"> is the change in brightness temperature.
In real, the emissivity is dependent on temperature, and only for small temperature
variations is the assumption valid.
The chosen ice temperature variations, which is in good agreement with typical 
variations, are <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_35212_tex2html_wrap904.gif"> 5K.
Because the emissivity is dependent on ice type, the change in brightness 
temperatures can't be modeled before the ice type is determined.
The modeling has been performed in each of the 7 areas, where the mean brightness 
temperature in each channel has been calculated.
The brightness temperature of water is assumed constant because of the thermal 
equilibrium between ice and water.
By employing the calculated ice conditions from <A HREF="node12.html">ice concentration section</A> and
<A HREF="node13.html">multi-year ice fraction section</A>, the change in brightness temperature has been determined from:
<P><A NAME=equationdeltaTB>&#160;</A><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_35212_equation542.gif"><P>
where I is the channel identifier.
The physical ice temperature is modeled in a <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_35212_tex2html_wrap904.gif"> 5K interval.
<A HREF="node14.html#equationdeltaTB">Equation 15</A>  gives the change in brightness temperature in
each channel, and by adding this to the calculated mean brightness temperatures in the
respective areas, the impact of changing ice temperature can be found.
In the <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_35212_tex2html_wrap904.gif"> 5K interval, the change in total ice concentration has been 
observed perfectly linear with the temperature change.
Therefore a linear regression has been performed in order to find the proportionality 
constant.
The obtained results are shown in <A HREF="node14.html#tablelinearregression">Table 6</A>. <P><A NAME=785>&#160;</A><A NAME=tablelinearregression>&#160;</A><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_35212_table560.gif">
<BR><STRONG>Table 6</STRONG> Proportionality constant in the linear regression of the sensitivity to 
changing physical temperatures in the total ice concentration (in %/K)<BR>
<P>
It shows, that in all cases, except the for the NASA algorithm, the sensitivity
increases with ice concentration.
This is because of the constant brightness temperature of open water, where the bigger
the water content, the smaller the influence of the changing ice temperature.
It is seen, that the NASA algorithm is insensitive to changing physical 
temperatures in areas with a total ice cover.
It uses the GR and PR ratios, and this gives the insensitivity
to ice temperature over consolidated ice.
However, in partly ice covered areas, the algorithm is influenced by changing ice
temperatures (see also <A HREF="node17.html#pedersen">[Pedersen., 1991, p. 49]</A>).
The COMPOL algorithm is seen to be less sensitive than the remaining 
three algorithms.
The largest sensitivity is in the NORSEX/COMFREQ algorithms, where the sensitivity
in certain areas is about 1%/K.<BR>In the two-channel algorithms, a change in physical temperature can be visualized in
a retrieval triangle (see e.g. <A HREF="node10.html#figtriangle">Figure 3</A> ).
From a certain point in the diagram, a change in physical temperature corresponds to 
a change in brightness temperature along a straight line with a slope given by the 
emissivity in the two channels.
If this line is parallel to e.g. the lines of constant ice concentration, the 
algorithm is insensitive to physical temperature with respect to ice concentration.
From <A HREF="node10.html#figtriangle">Figure 3</A>  it can be seen, that the lines of constant ice
concentration and constant multi-year ice fraction are not parallel, and therefore
no two-channel algorithm can be insensitive with respect to both ice concentration and 
multi-year ice fraction.
According to <A HREF="node17.html#pedersen">[Pedersen., 1991, p. 99-101]</A>, the size of the retrieval triangle is related
to the sensitivity to measurement noise, but this also applies other noise factors.
Therefore, in a big retrieval triangle, the sensitivity to changes in physical 
temperature is less than in a smaller triangle.<BR>The NORSEX/COMFREQ algorithms uses the 37V and 19V channels, where the distances 
between the open water tie-point and the first-year/multi-year tiepoints are smaller
than in the 37H and 19H channels.
This can explain the rather large sensitivity in these algorithms compared to the AES
algorithm.
The AES algorithm uses the 19H channel, which has a low brightness temperature
from open water, so the distance between the tiepoints are bigger in the 19H channel
than e.g. in 37H channel that the COMPOL algorithm uses.
Anyway, the COMPOL algorithm gives less sensitivity to changing ice temperatures.
This can be explained by the slope of the 100% ice line, which is very
close to the slope of the straight line given by the emissivities.
This is not the case in the AES algorithm.
<P>
The linear regression has also been performed on the multi-year ice fraction, and 
the results are given in <A HREF="node14.html#tablemultiyearlinearregression">Table 7</A>. <P><A NAME=789>&#160;</A><A NAME=tablemultiyearlinearregression>&#160;</A><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_35212_table597.gif">
<BR><STRONG>Table 7</STRONG> Proportionality constant in the linear regression of the sensitivity of 
changing physical temperatures in the multi-year ice fraction (in %/K)<BR>
<P>
Here, the NASA algorithm is total insensitive to changing physical temperatures.
The COMPOL estimation of the multi-year ice fraction is just as sensitive to 
changing temperatures as the remaining three algorithms.
The largest sensitivity is almost 2%/K.
In this case, there is no general relation between ice concentration and the order of
sensitivity, but the amount of multi-year ice is seen to matter.
The AES and COMPOL algorithms are seen to perform best in areas with a high multi-year 
ice content, while the NORSEX and COMFREQ algorithms performs best with little
multi-year ice. 
The reason for this is probably caused by a complex connection between the slope
of the constant multi-year ice lines at different positions in the retrieval triangle
and the slope given by the emissivities.

<P>
The SSM/I radiometer has a sensitivity on the measured brightness temperatures of 
about 0.6K (see e.g. <A HREF="node17.html#hollinger">[Hollinger et al., 1990]</A>).
The effect of this finite sensitivity has been analyzed by adding a Gaussian 
distributed noise signal with a standard deviation of 0.6K to the input brightness 
temperatures.
<P>
The mean brightness temperatures in the two-month period have been calculated
for the 4 channels and the 7 areas.
These temperatures have been used as input to represent a noise-free
measurement.
The Gaussian noise has been added to the input signals, and the ice concentration
and the multi-year ice fraction have been calculated.
The standard deviation on the output after e.g. 10000 loops of each algorithm is then 
entirely caused by the added noise signal.<BR>For the total ice concentration, the standard deviation is shown in
<A HREF="node15.html#tableiceconcentrationmeasurementnoise">Table 8</A>. <P><A NAME=791>&#160;</A><A NAME=tableiceconcentrationmeasurementnoise>&#160;</A><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_35212_table624.gif">
<BR><STRONG>Table 8</STRONG> Standard deviation on total ice concentration caused by a Gaussian 
distributed noise signal with a 0.6K standard deviation (in %)<BR>
<P>
It shows, that all algorithms except NASA have the same standard deviation 
for all areas.
This is due to the linear relation between the brightness temperatures and the
ice concentration.
The random number generator in the programs generates the same sequence at each
program execution, and therefore all areas have the same standard deviation in these
algorithms.<BR>It is seen, that the COMPOL algorithm is the most sensitive to measurement noise,
with a standard deviation on the total ice concentration on 2.6% caused by the
SSM/I microwave radiometer sensitivity of 0.6K.
The least sensitive is the AES algorithm.
In <A HREF="node17.html#pedersen">[Pedersen., 1991, p. 99-101]</A> it is shown, that the distance between the tiepoints are 
related to the sensitivity to measurement noise.
This can also be seen in <A HREF="node15.html#tableiceconcentrationmeasurementnoise">Table 8</A>, where the least sensitive AES algorithm uses the 19H channel, which has a low radiance
from open water (<A HREF="node10.html#tabletiepoints">Table 1</A> ), and hence a large distance between the
tiepoints.
Also the NASA algorithm uses the 19H channel, and this is the second least
sensitive algorithm to measurement noise.
<P>
For the multi-year ice fraction, the standard deviation is shown in 
<A HREF="node15.html#tablemultiyearicefractionmeasurementnoise">Table 9</A>. <P><A NAME=795>&#160;</A><A NAME=tablemultiyearicefractionmeasurementnoise>&#160;</A><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_35212_table659.gif">
<BR><STRONG>Table 9</STRONG> Standard deviation on the multi-year ice fraction caused by a Gaussian 
distributed noise signal with a 0.6K standard deviation (in %)<BR>
<P>
It shows, that the standard deviation of the multi-year ice fraction now differs for
the different areas (because of the non-linear relation between brightness
temperature and multi-year ice fraction).
The NASA algorithm now gives the biggest standard deviation on the multi-year ice 
fraction when noise is added to the input, whereas the AES algorithm still is the
least sensitive.
The other three algorithms are about equally sensitive to the measurement noise on 
the multi-year ice fraction.
Generally, the standard deviation is smallest in areas with a complete ice coverage.
This is because the fluctuations in ice concentration will have less influence on the
multi-year ice fraction when the ice concentration is high.

<P>
A total of 5 multichannel microwave radiometer algorithms have been compared on 7
areas including combinations of open water (W), multi-year ice (MY) and first-year
ice (FY).<BR> In order to calibrate all algorithms, mean brightness temperatures from a 
two-month period have been calculated from W, MY and FY areas.
These brightness temperatures are properly transformed to tiepoints for each 
individual algorithm by employing e.g. a given atmosphere model to the satellite 
measured brightness temperatures.<BR> The COMFREQ and NORSEX algorithms have been shown theoreticly to produce the same
results when the tiepoints to the NORSEX algorithm are transformed according to
its atmosphere model.
This has been demonstrated by this comparison.<BR>
<P>
All algorithms have been used to calculate the total mean ice concentration in a 
two-month winter period, and thereby it has been shown, that the algorithms always
produces results with an absolute deviation of less than 2 %.
All algorithms are unbiased, i.e. in the tie-point areas of W, MY and FY, they all
produce ice concentrations of 0 %, 100 % and 100 %, 
respectively.
Plots of the ice concentration through the period shows, that all algorithms produces
similar results.
Within the tie-point areas, the curves are very similar, and the calculated 
changes in ice concentration is believed to be created by the same effects in all 
algorithms.
However, the COMPOL algorithm has a worse performance than the other algorithms in the
open water area.<BR>The standard deviation on the daily measurements through the period ranges from 
1.2 % to 11 %.
A significant contribution comes from changing ice conditions in the period, and the
figures are only suitable for this intercomparison.
The small difference between the algorithms shows, that the geophysical 
influence have almost the same effect on all algorithms.<BR>
<P>
The algorithms ability to divide the ice types in multi-year ice and first-year
ice have been investigated through the multi-year ice fraction.
Again in the tie-point areas, all algorithms produces average values very close to the 
expected figures.
In the tie-point areas, the curves from the different algorithms are very similar.
There are rather big variations through the period; almost equal in all algorithms.
This is probably caused by changing ice- or geophysical conditions in the period, and
these effects are having almost the same influence in all algorithms.
In the other areas, the average multi-year ice fractions differs less than 
6 %.
In a W/FY area, the multi-year ice fraction ranges between -8.4 % and 
-9.9 %, which indicates, that it is underestimated.
Also in a W/MY area, the multi-year ice fraction is underestimated.<BR>The standard deviation on the daily multi-year ice fractions ranges between 
7.6 % and 17.5 %, and again it is primarily caused by changing ice 
conditions in the period.<BR>
<P>
The sensitivity of the algorithms to changes in the physical ice temperature have 
been analyzed.
Hereby it has been shown, that the NORSEX/COMFREQ algorithms are most sensitive,
with changes in the total ice concentration up to 1 %/K.
The COMPOL algorithm is less sensitive than the AES, NORSEX and COMFREQ algorithms.
The NASA algorithm is insensitive over consolidated ice, which is caused by its use
of the polarization ratio and spectral gradient ratio.
The impact of changing temperatures on the multi-year ice fraction is investigated, 
and here the NASA algorithm is totally insensitive, while the other four algorithms 
shows a comparable sensitivity of up to 2 %/K.<BR>The sensitivity of the algorithms to measurement noise have been investigated by 
adding Gaussian distributed noise to the input signals.
This has shown, that the COMPOL algorithm is most sensitive to measurement noise,
and that the standard deviation of the ice concentration is more than 2.5 %
for a 0.6K standard deviation on the input signal.
The least sensitive to measurement noise is the AES algorithm, which produces a
standard deviation close to 1 % for a 0.6K standard deviation on the input.
The influence on the multi-year ice fraction is most severe in the NASA algorithm,
while the other four are about equal sensitive.<BR>
<P>
The only clear conclusion from this comparison is, that the COMPOL algorithm always 
has the biggest standard deviations on its ice estimates.
It only uses 37GHz channels, and it therefore gives the best spatial
resolution.
The 37GHz channels are more sensitive to geophysical influence, and the price to be 
paid for a better spatial resolution is a degradation in radiometric resolution.<BR>A major result is, that all algorithms on average produces very 
similar results.
This is caused by the careful tie-point selection, where tiepoints are transformed
according the the algorithm atmosphere model.
The important issues are therefore not to select a prober algorithm, but to adjust the
tiepoints to the selected algorithm. 
Further, plots of ice concentrations and multi-year ice fractions through a two 
month winter period have shown, the the variation between the algorithms normally are
of little significance compared to the total variations.
The total variations are dominated by geophysical variations, and an effort in 
incorporating these parameters in the algorithms might be the key to more precise
algorithms in future.<BR>For precise short term estimates, measurement- and geophysical noise can be of 
significance, and a prober algorithm for reducing the principal noise components has 
to be chosen.
The noise analysis has shown, that a big retrieval triangle reduces the sensitivity 
to measurement noise, and that a certain algorithm in a certain area can be 
insensitive to changing ice temperatures with respect to either the ice concentration
or the multi-year ice fraction.<BR>

<H1><A NAME=SECTION00200000000000000000> Introduction</A></H1>
<P>
 This is a reference manual of the projection functions available in
 C and FORTRAN. Some functions are additions to the EMI Image Header
 System <A HREF="node15.html#EMI">[1]</A> and cannot be used alone.
<P>
 These functions makes more than 70 map projections available through a 
 minimum set of interface functions. With these functions it is possible
 to make transformations between geographical, map, and image coordinates.
<P>
 To gain more information about the projections, please refer to the two
 projection reports produced by the United States Department of the Interior
 Geological Survey <A HREF="node15.html#usgs">[2]</A> and <A HREF="node15.html#proj4">[3]</A>. The reports are available on
 the USGS anonymous ftp-server:
 <tt>charon.er.usgs.gov</tt> (IP-address 128.128.40.24).
<P>
 <H2><A NAME=SECTION00201000000000000000> Overview</A></H2>
<P>
 The functions presented in this report has been build on the Cartographic
 Projection Procedures by Gerald I. Evenden at the United States Department
 of the Interior, Geological survey (USGS), <A HREF="node15.html#usgs">[2]</A> and <A HREF="node15.html#proj4">[3]</A>. The
 presented functions can be categorized in three groups:
<P>
 <OL>  <LI> Basic projection routines: <em>init_proj()</em>, and <em>proj()</em>.
  <LI> Geometric functions included in the EMI Image Header System <A HREF="node15.html#EMI">[1]</A>:
        <em>init_geom()</em>, <em>map()</em>, and <em>world()</em>.
  <LI> Information functions: <em>nprojparm()</em>, <em>projfix()</em>, 
        <em>projlbl()</em>, and <em>projparmlbl()</em>
 </OL>
<P>
 The functions in group 1 are used in applications not including the EMI
 Image Header System. Here the projection is initialized with a call to
 <em>init_proj()</em>, and the cartesian and geographical coordinates are
 calculated by calls to <em>proj()</em>.
<P>
 The functions in group 2 are used in applications that uses the EMI Image
 Header System. Here the projection is initialized with a call to
 <em>init_geom()</em>, and the image and geographical coordinates are calculated
 by calls to <em>map()</em> and <em>world()</em> respectively.
<P>
 The information functions in group 3 are used to retrieve textual information
 about the projections and their parameters. These functions can be used in
 conjunction with the group 1 functions as well as the group 2 functions.
<P>
 Chapter <A HREF="node3.html#chapfunc"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/u/emilib/lib/perl/latex2html/icons/cross_ref_motif.gif"></A> contains references to the functions, and
 Appendix <A HREF="node13.html#appproj"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/u/emilib/lib/perl/latex2html/icons/cross_ref_motif.gif"></A> contains lists of the available projections and their
 parameters. In Appendix <A HREF="node14.html#appellps"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/u/emilib/lib/perl/latex2html/icons/cross_ref_motif.gif"></A> a list of available ellipse names is
 given.
<P>
 <H2><A NAME=SECTION00202000000000000000> Usage</A></H2>
<P>
 When the functions are used in C, some include files are necessary, since
 they define some constants needed in addition to offer prototypes for
 the functions. There exists two include files:
<P>
 <P><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_24619_tabular35.gif"><P>
<P>
 The four information functions look up in the database file <tt>.projections</tt>
 which contains all available projections. This file should be placed in the
 same directory as the EMI libraries, and a environment variable, 
 <tt>$EMIDBDIR</tt> <em>must</em> be set to this directory, e.g.:
<P>
 <tt>export EMIDBDIR=/usr/local/lib/emilib
<P>
 </tt>
<P>
 In order to use the referenced functions, four libraries has to be linked
 with the executable program:
<P>
 <P><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_24619_tabular54.gif"><P>
<P>
 This is done by specifying the follow arguments to the linker:
<P>
   ... <tt>-lproj -lemi -lm</tt>
 ...Make sure the linker knows where to find the libraries (the <tt>-L</tt> option).
<P>
 If the executable is to be used with the EMI Image Header System, additional
 libraries are needed. Please refer to <A HREF="node15.html#EMI">[1]</A> for more information.

<pre>
     IMGID        The partition identifier
     SKIPL, SKIPS The skip factors used, resp. in line and sample.
     MAGL, MAGS   The pixel magnification used, resp. in line and sample.
     IRC          The function return code.
</pre>
<P>
<H2><A NAME=SECTION00313000000000000000> Description</A></H2>
<P>
 The <tt>init_geometric</tt> and it's related functions are used to convert
 between line/sample coordinates for a specific image (referenced by the
 <tt>imgID</tt> partition identifier) and latitude/longitude coordinates.
<P>
 The function is part of the EMI Image Header System <A HREF="node15.html#EMI">[1]</A>. In order for
 the function to work properly in C, the <tt>getcom_()</tt> function <em>must</em>
 be called prior to <tt>init_geometric</tt>.
<P>
 If the referenced image is accesed with line and/or sample skipping and
 possibly pixel magnification in line and/or sample direction, the 
 conversion functions can be instructed to adjust the coordinates. This is
 done by scaling the pixel spacing (<tt>PSPAX</tt> and <tt>PSPAY</tt>) parameters
 stored in the partition:
<P>
<P><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_24619_displaymath1504.gif"><P>
 where <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_24619_tex2html_wrap1506.gif"> is the original pixel spacing in the line respectively the 
 sample direction, <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_24619_tex2html_wrap1508.gif"> the number of lines resp. samples to skip <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_24619_tex2html_wrap1510.gif">,
 <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_24619_tex2html_wrap1512.gif"> the pixel magnification factor in line resp. sample direction, and
 <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="_24619_tex2html_wrap1514.gif"> the scaled spacing.
<P>
 The convertion functions are able to use an elliptical Earth for the
 projection. The elliptical parameters are those discussed
 in <A HREF="node15.html#ttwsparmwswsvaltt">[2]</A>[p. 9]usgs. The parameters has to be located in one or more
 optional header records labeled <tt>&amp;&amp;</tt>. Each record can contain
 one or more of the elliptical parameters, separated with a whitespace
 character, and they can be placed in any
 order. Each parameter definition must have the following syntax:
<P>
<pre>
                    [ws] parm [ws] = [ws] val
</pre>
 where <tt>[ws]</tt> is optional whitespace (ie. space or tab characters),
 <tt>parm</tt> is the parameter identifier (ie. 'A', 'B', ...), and <tt>val</tt>
 is the parameter value which is either a floating point number or a string of 
 characters.
<P>
 The possible values for <tt>parm</tt> are:
<P>
<table>
<td ALIGN=left><tt>A</tt><td ALIGN=left>Semimajor axis or equitorial radius. <tr>
<td ALIGN=left><tt>B</tt><td ALIGN=left>Semiminor axis or polar radius. <tr>

<td ALIGN=left><tt>NAME</tt><td ALIGN=left>Ellipse name. <tr>
</table><P>
 As stated in <A HREF="node15.html#usgs">[2]</A>, only the needed parameters should be defined, the
 rest should be left undefined. Does any parameter occur more than once, then
 the <em>last</em> definition is used. Refer to Appendix <A HREF="node14.html#appellps"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="/u/emilib/lib/perl/latex2html/icons/cross_ref_motif.gif"></A> for

<title>Example 1</title>
</head>

<body>
<h1>Example 1</h1>

In this example, the imageclass variable <tt>ic</tt> is created with default
values (i.e. no arguments in the definition). Using the first program argument
<tt>argv[1]</tt> as a filename, the image file is opened with <tt>iopen()</tt>.
<p>
If the file exists, and is a valid image file, the error flag is not set, and
<tt>ok()</tt> returns true. Two of the HEADFORM record values are retrieved with
the function <tt>Size()</tt> and written to standard output.
<p>
On the other hand, if <tt>ok()</tt> returns false, an error message is retrieved
with the help of <tt>errormsg()</tt>, and the text is sent to standard error.
<p>
<pre>
#include &lt;cimage.h&gt;
#include &lt;iostream.h&gt;

int main (int argv, const char* argv[])
{
  imageclass  ic;

  // Open the image
  ic.iopen(argv[1]);

  // Check the error status
  if (ic.ok()) {
    cout &lt;&lt; "# of lines: " &lt;&lt; ic.Size().l &lt;&lt; " ";
    cout &lt;&lt; "# of samples: " &lt;&lt; ic.Size().s &lt;&lt; endl;
  }
  else {
    // Error occured
    cerr &lt;&lt; "ERROR: " &lt;&lt; ic.errormsg(argv[1]) &lt;&lt; endl;
    return -1;
  }

  // Everything went ok
  return 0;
}
</pre>

<title>Example 2</title>
</head>

<body>
<h1>Example 2</h1>

This example creates a new image if it does not exist already. The title
is set <i>before</i> the image is created.
<p>
The values from 1 to 10 is written as image data.
<p>
The variables are initialized in the declarations. For the image
type and the image data type, two constants from the imageclass are used:
<tt>FMT_RASTER</tt> and <tt>IMG_DOUBLE</tt>. These constants must be preceded with
the class name, '<tt>imageclas::</tt>'.
<p>
An 8-bit signed integer 2 x 5 buffer is allocated, and <tt>data</tt> is used
as an initialization array.
<p>
The title is set with the set-function <tt>Title()</tt>.
<p>
As in example 1, the first program argument is used as the filename. If the
file can be created with <tt>icreate()</tt>, the header information is written to
the image file.
<p>
If no error occured during creation, the buffer is written to the file using
<tt>iwrite()</tt>. Note, that the data type of the buffer is 8-bit signed integer,
whereas the image data is of data type 64-bit floating point.
<p>
The file is automatically closed, when the program terminates.
<p>
On the other hand, if <tt>ok()</tt> returns false, an error message is retrieved
with the help of <tt>errormsg()</tt>, and the text is sent to standard error.

Colours are according to pseudo ice concentration derived by a special algorithm combining data at 19 and 37 GHz with the
spatial resolution of the 85 GHz channels.
They reveal details about the ice cover on an improved spatial resolution compared with the traditional low frequency
based algorithms.
<p>
The white curve is the coastline of Greenland.

Image is displayed and manipulated by the DCRS developed EMImage display
software.

<H1>NIRS CAMPAIGNS</H1>

<P>People often ask us, what exactly is NIRS' role, what do you do?</P>

<P>Besides serving as the national information and networking center for
grassroots anti-nuclear/environmental groups (which means about 200 phone
calls daily, dozens of faxes and e-mails, and a lot of mail to boot), NIRS
also initiates campaigns to address specific issues.</P>

<P>Current campaigns include:</P>

<UL>
<LI><B><A HREF="dtwsam.htm">Don't Waste America.</A></B> Our largest campaign:
this focuses on unnecessary and unsafe radioactive waste dumping and transportation.
Encompassed in it are our efforts against &quot;interim&quot; radioactive
waste storage and against new radioactive waste dumps such as Ward Valley,
CA and Sierra Blanca, TX. </LI>

<LI><B><A HREF="/moxtritium/moxtrit.htm">Military-Industrial-Utility Complex.</A></B>
This is a new campaign to stop the use of Mixed-Oxide (or plutonium-based)
fuel in commercial reactors as well as the production of tritium for nuclear
weapons in commercial reactors. </LI>

<LI><B><A HREF="/reactorproject/reacproj.htm">Reactor Watchdog Project.</A></B>
The recent emphasis of this campaign has been to close the dangerous Haddam
Neck and Oyster Creek reactors. This project is also responsible for our
work on Thermo-Lag, reactor aging, and more. Look for some more bombshells
on fire protection issues in coming months. </LI>

<LI><B><A HREF="/utilityrestructuring/nirsderg.htm">Utility Restructuring.</A></B>
This new campaign is our effort to bring nuclear sanity to the utility
deregulation process and to help ensure that restructuring does not reduce
safety margins. During 1997, look for a major report on these issues, and
how grassroots activists can effectively address &quot;stranded costs,&quot;
reduced maintenance, power production over safety, and more. </LI>

<LI><B><A HREF="/easternnis/eastnis.htm">Eastern Europe/Newly Independent
States.</A></B> This is another new campaign. Basically, we are bringing
the same level of services we provide to U.S. grassroots activists to the
East--specifically to local activists fighting the most dangerous and entrenched
nuclear community of all: that found in Eastern Europe and the Newly Independent
States. Not surprisingly, the enemies are often the same: Westinghouse,
GE, ABB, Siemens, and so on. </LI>

<LI><A HREF="../../pepcobge/pepbge.htm">Pepco/BG&amp;E merger.</A> For
local DC area activists, NIRS is working to stop the proposed merger of
Pepco and Baltimore Gas &amp; Electric. Rather than preparing to offer
lower electricity prices in response to competition, these utilities want
to merge to avoid competition. And Pepco ratepayers would get stuck with
all the costs associated with BG&amp;E's Calvert Cliffs reactors! It's
a bad deal all around. </LI>
</UL>

<P>Contributions to specific campaigns are always welcome, as are volunteer
help, community organizing and outreach, production of fact sheets and
other materials, occasional backrubs, and whatever other services and encouragement
you can donate or provide....</P>

<h1>Welcome to NIRSNET on the Web</h1>

<p><a href="nirsweb.gif"><img src="nirsweb.gif" border=2 height=60 width=300></a></p>

<p>Welcome to NIRSNET on the Web! This area is now completely indexed.
We are trying to add new files daily, and we are updating the indexes as
frequently as possible. NIRS' Webboard is also active and working; see
below.</p>

<p>NIRS has completed transfer of the files previously on the NIRSNET bbs.
Below is a list of several file areas. Each file area is indexed separately.
Because of the huge volume of files now on this web, we are no longer listing
each document individually. Rather, we will list new and particularly interesting
documents in each file category. For more information, contact NIRS at
<a href="mailto:nirsnet@igc.apc.org">nirsnet@igc.apc.org</a> or call 202-328-0002.
Thanks. We hope NIRSNET on the Web meets your needs. You may also send
your suggestions for improvement and comments to the above e-mail address
directly from this site. </p>

<p>

<h2><img src="new.gif" border=0 height=13 width=32 align=bottom><a href="http://www.nirs.org/webboard/$webb.exe">Check
out the new NIRS Webboard!</a></h2>

<p>Discuss issues and ideas with activists from around the world. Ask for
help, offer help. Dialogue with industry if you want, and vice-versa. Communicate.</p>

<p>You will be asked for a user name and a password. The username is used
solely to log into the NIRS Webboard and should not be your real name.
Make up a name and password that you'll remember easily. Once logged in
the first time, you will be asked to fill out a very brief questionnaire.
All messages within the NIRS Webboard will be signed with your real name.</p>

<H2>April 1996--A Month of Remembrance, Reflection, Assistance and Action</H2> 
<P>On April 26, 1986, the Chernobyl nuclear reactor exploded, spewing deadly
radiation across the Ukraine, Belarus, eastern and western Europe, and
ultimately the entire globe. The full dimensions of the Chernobyl nuclear
disaster--the worst single accident of the industrial age--are unknown to this
day. But nearly ten years later, the suffering continues. And the possibility of
another nuclear accident remains.
</P>
<P>Consider these facts (taken from a November 28, 1995 Reuters article):

<P>At least nine million people in the Ukraine, Belarus and Russia have been
affected by the Chernobyl disaster; several million still live in contaminated
zones.
</P>
<P>The contaminated area of Ukraine and Belarus is about 61,780 square
miles--the size of England, Wales and Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>Birth rates in Belarus have fallen 50 percent.
</P>
<P>Thyroid cancer, particularly among children, is up 285 percent in Belarus.
</P>
<P>About 7,000 people in Russia alone are believed to have died from the
accident (The Ukraine Ministry of Health estimates as many as 125,000 deaths in
the Ukraine).
</P>
<P>Belarus spends 20 percent of its annual budget coping with Chernobyl's
aftermath; Ukraine, four percent; Russia, one percent.
</P>
<P>The United Nations trust fund for Chernobyl victims is &quot;virtually
empty.&quot; The World Health Organization estimates it alone needs $200 million
over the next 20 years, but only a fraction of that is likely to be made
available.
</P>
<P>During April 1996, citizens across the world will remember the Chernobyl
accident, and will take action to expose its full impact, help relieve the
suffering, and hasten the end of the nuclear age.
</P>
<P>U.S. activities are being coordinated by Nuclear Information and Resource
Service (NIRS) and Greenpeace.  </P>

<P>January 14, 1997</P>
<P>Contact: Michael Mariotte or Mary Olson, 202-328-0002</P>
<H2>171 ORGANIZATIONS WORLDWIDE CONDEMN U.S. MOX DECISION; ASK PRESIDENT
CLINTON TO STOP PLUTONIUM FUEL APPROACH</H2>
<P>171 environmental, peace, and medical organizations today condemned
outgoing-Department of Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary's decision to pursue an
option that would use plutonium-based fuel (or mixed-oxide, MOX) in commercial
nuclear reactors as a means of attempting to make plutonium from nuclear weapons
into a non-weapons-ready form.</P>
<P>The 171 groups, from every corner of the globe, said that the MOX fuel
approach would increase international commerce in plutonium, would create even
hotter high-level radioactive waste, and would provide a disincentive for
anti-proliferation efforts across the world.</P>
<P>The letter to President Clinton was signed by organizations from Russia,
Japan, Turkey, Canada, the Netherlands, Ukraine, Slovokia, Lithuania and several
other countries. 100 of the signers were from U.S. organizations, which also
cited increased security, transportation, nuclear safety and other risks
involved with plutonium-based fuel.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;Hazel O'Leary has made a great contribution by publicizing past
radiation experiments on the American people,&quot; said Michael Mariotte,
executive director of Nuclear Information and Resource Service, which
coordinated the international letter to Clinton,&quot; but by supporting the use
of plutonium fuel in civilian nuclear reactors, her legacy could be her greatest
mistake. Use of MOX fuel would be the largest, and potentially most tragic,
radiation experiment ever unleashed on the American people.&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Said Harvey Wasserman of Greenpeace, USA, &quot;The international nature of
this letter's signers' indicates the global opposition to MOX fuel. Across the
world, people are saying no to plutonium, and no to creation of a
military-industrial-utility complex.&quot;</P>
<P>The DOE has said it must pursue MOX because Russia views its plutonium as an
asset rather than a waste, and thus also wants to use the controversial process.
But without western economic aid, Russia is unlikely to attain the resources to
use the MOX approach. Moreover, Russian groups signing the letter indicated that
the Russian people oppose use of MOX fuel as well. Vladimiar Sliviak of Russia's
Socio-Ecological Union said that Russian environmental organizations are working
to cut Russian funding and government support for MOX programs.</P>
<P>Secretary O'Leary has suggested that if U.S. opposition to MOX is too
strong, then the U.S. government would consider using Canadian reactors to &quot;burn&quot;
the plutonium fuel. But, said, Irene Kock of Canada's Nuclear Awareness Project,
&quot;Canadians refuse to be the world's dumping ground for high level nuclear
waste. If plutonium fuel is sent to Canada, we're supposed to keep the waste.
Canadians will not tolerate this deal--it's a very dangerous precedent. The U.S.
and Russia must secure their plutonum stocks safely within their own boundaries.&quot;</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;Ontario Hydro is simply using the plutonium fuel scheme to justify
rebuilding the aging Bruce reactors, which will otherwise be shut down early,
and to obtain operating subsidies,&quot; Kock continued. &quot;Is the U.S. DOE
prepared to subsidize Ontario's public utility?&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Said Michael Mariotte of NIRS, &quot;This is just the first step in our
anti-MOX campaign. We are now preparing to take our legitimate concerns to the
American people to make it impossible for any U.S. utility or government entity
to bring plutonium into our states and communities. We agree that weapons-ready
plutonium must be made inaccessible, but MOX fuel in commercial reactors simply
compounds the problem. We're seeking solutions, not short-cuts.&quot;</P>
<P>A copy of the letter to President Clinton, with a list of all signers, is
available upon request from NIRS.</P>
<P>Signers of the letter included 100 grassroots organizations and individuals
from the United States, 36 organizations from Turkey and the Eastern
Mediterranean; 9 Russian environmental organizations; five groups from Canada,
three from Japan and the Netherlands, two from Ukraine, Scotland, and Germany,
and one each from Austria, Czech Republic, England, India, Lithuania, New
Zealand, Slovokia, South Africa, and Sweden.</P>

<H1>Don't Waste America</H1>

<P>The nuclear power industry is pushing Congress to establish an &quot;interim&quot;
high-level radioactive waste storage dump near Yucca Mountain, Nevada.
This proposal, encapsulated in H.R. 1020 and S. 167, would set into motion
the unprecedented transportation of high-level nuclear waste through 43
states and hundreds of towns and cities--probably yours! This legislation
is unneeded and dangerous. Rather than try yet another doomed &quot;quick
fix,&quot; it would be far better to establish an Independent Commission
to fully re-examine and re-evaluate our nation's failed radioactive waste
policies. For more information, <A HREF="fctsht.htm">check out NIRS factsheets</A>.</P>

<H2>The Military-Industrial-Utility Complex</H2>
<P>The U.S. Department of Energy is preparing to approve the use of
plutonium-based (or MOX--mixed oxide) fuel in commercial nuclear reactors. In
addition, the DOE is preparing to encourage the production of tritium for
nuclear weapons in civilian reactors. These far-reaching steps violate every
non-proliferation principle advanced by the U.S. government for decades.</P>
<P>NIRS is unalterably opposed to the use of MOX fuel and the production of
tritium in commercial reactors. Use of MOX would contribute to the worldwide &quot;plutonium
economy,&quot; and would undercut our non-proliferation efforts worldwide. In
addition, it would produce more plutonium in so-called &quot;low-level&quot;
radioactive waste, exacerbate utility decommissioning efforts and increase
costs, expose more people to danger from plutonium through frequent shipments
across railways and highways, and would increase electricity costs.</P>
<P>Similarly, production of tritium in commercial reactors is little more than
a scheme to allow uneconomic reactors to operate with increased government
subsidies. Further, it would break down any remaining barrier between commercial
and military uses of nuclear energy--leaving us with a new, and frighteningly
powerful military-industrial-utility complex.</P>
<P>Yurika's plutonium updates, issued every 2-3 weeks, are excellent primers on
the MOX issue.</P>

<H2>NIRS and Utility Deregulation</H2>

<P>1997 and 1998 will see one of the messiest, knock-down, drag-out fights
ever experienced in the United States Congress. That battle will be played
out on a backdrop of similar struggles in dozens of state legislatures.
The issue is huge and the bedfellows are likely to be very strange indeed.
It's utility deregulation, and if you thought deregulating a few phone
companies was rough, wait til Congress and the States take on a couple
hundred electric utilities!</P>

<P>NIRS' primary interests in utility deregulation issues are to ensure
that deregulation does not increase nuclear risks, that uneconomic nuclear
reactors are closed rather than artificially allowed to continue operating,
and that ratepayers are not stuck paying for continuing nuclear mistakes.
We also believe that deregulation should help bring about a new reliance
on renewable sources of energy--although closing unsafe and uneconomic
nuclear reactors remains the best way to encourage utilities to go renewable.
</P>

<P>There already are many fully-indexed and searchable files available
on deregulation issues in the Economics section of <A HREF="/htdocs/nirsbbs.htm">NIRSNET
on the Web</A>. Here you'll find the highlights, as well as NIRS' positions
on these issues. And don't forget to use <A HREF="http://www.nirs.org/webboard/$webb.exe">NIRS'
WebBoard</A> if you have questions, comments, or want to give your own
opinion on deregulation.</P>

<H2>Eastern Europe/NIS Project</H2>

<P>During 1997, NIRS will be extending its basic services to grassroots
environmental activists working in Eastern Europe and the Newly Independent
States. Activists in this region are usually underfunded, subject to repression
and suppression, and yet face perhaps the most dangerous nuclear menace
of all--a legacy of poorly-built and poorly-maintained Soviet nuclear reactors
and little, if any, radioactive waste management.</P>

<P>The activists in this area of the world work--often very effectively--against
great odds, with very few resources. It is NIRS' goal to supplement those
resources as much as we can. In many cases, the villains are now the same
as we face in the West: Westinghouse, Siemens, General Electric, Framatome--the
same companies that have threatened us all with nuclear meltdowns, cost
overruns, and a disrespect for openness and democracy. They now are jumping
on the Eastern bandwagon to &quot;upgrade&quot; or complete building hopeless
nuclear reactors. </P>

<P>We welcome your help in this new endeavor. We need volunteers in our
Washington office and elsewhere: translators, researchers, interns, and
others who can help. </P>

<P>Here you'll find selected files, grassroots publications, campaign updates,
and other information related to Eastern and NIS activities. Also check
out the International section of <A HREF="/htdocs/nirsbbs.htm">NIRSNET
on the Web </A>for much more on international anti-nuclear activities,
and use the <A HREF="http://www.nirs.org/$webboard/webb.exe">NIRS WebBoard</A>
for conversation, questions, and to keep up with each other.</P>

<H2>NIRS Reactor Watchdog Project</H2>

<P>This project encompasses NIRS' work on nuclear reactor safety issues,
including reactor aging, use of ineffective Thermo-Lag fire barriers, containment
degradation and many more. Among this project's other current activities
are major campaigns to close the dangerous and uneconomical Haddam Neck
and Oyster Creek nuclear reactors. Here you'll find various NIRS and other
documents on these efforts. For more information about reactor-related
issues, check out our extensive files in the Reactor section of <A HREF="/htdocs/nirsbbs.htm">NIRSNET
on the Web.</A></P>

<P>On November 25, 1996, NIRS and the Citizens Awareness Network of Massachusetts
and Connecticut <A HREF="cypaper.htm">released a major report</A> detailing
the myriad of safety problems at Haddam Neck and called for the NRC to
revoke the reactor's operating license. </P>

<P>NIRS and CAN also released a <A HREF="cy2206.htm">formal petition</A>
to the NRC calling for revocation of Haddam Neck's license. 11/25/96.</P>

prepare for the upgrade. The site will be down for about a day at the end of
this period--we will try to provide advance notice here of that date. The new

worth the downtime.</P>

<H1>Radiation</H1>

<P>This area includes files on radiation, its health effects, and government
standards for &quot;acceptable risk&quot; from radiation. We hope this
area will grow rapidly, and will include not only government documents,
but also the work of scientists from around the world. We welcome your
submissions to this area (as we do for all areas of NIRSNET on the Web).
Please send in .txt or .html format to <A HREF="mailto:nirsnet@igc.apc.org">nirsnet@igc.apc.org</A>.</P>

<P>Many people are surprised to learn that federal standards regulating
radiation exposure are much laxer than those regulating other hazardous
materials. For example, the Environmental Protection Agency, Food and Drug
Administration and other regulatory bodies routinely require that public
exposure to hazardous materials lead to a 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 1,000,000
lifetime chance of death (levels themselves routinely criticized as too
weak). Federal radiation standards promulgated by the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission, however, are the equivalent of a 1 in 285 lifetime chance of
fatal cancer. This means that of people who receive the full legal maximum
dose allowed by the NRC, 1 in 285 are predicted to die as a direct result
of receiving this dose.</P>

<P>Because radiation is as the heart of the entire nuclear controversy,
every other file area on NIRSNET on the Web is related to this issue. Please
feel free to look around. This area is indexed, <A HREF="radindex.htm">click
here to access </A>the index.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+3>Recent Highlights</FONT></P>

<P>NRC releases <A HREF="Sy96172.txt">final air emissions standards for
non-power reactors</A>. NIRS had sued the agency over its similar standards
for reactors, but lost in federal court. Secy paper dated August 5, 1996,
but released to public November 1996.</P>

<H1>Decommissioning and Deregulation </H1>

<P>This area includes files on the decommissioning of nuclear reactors
and other atomic facilities, and on the deregulation of radioactive waste.
At first blush, these areas may seem unrelated. However, they are in fact
inextricably tied: the nuclear power industry and the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission see deregulation (declaring a certain level of radiation &quot;safe&quot;
or &quot;acceptable&quot; and thus not requiring regulatory oversight)
as the essential key to allowing cheap decommissioning of nuclear facilities.
Once a level of radiation is accepted as &quot;safe,&quot; the way is clear
for further deregulation of radioactive materials--for example, in consumer
products, as regular garbage, etc. The NRC has from time to time proposed
just such a deregulation policy (last time it was called &quot;below regulatory
concern&quot; and was revoked by Congress in 1992 following a national
grassroots citizens uprising). The NRC is now seeking new ways to implement
a deregulation policy, through decommissioning standards. Because deregulation
policies benefit only the nuclear industry--obviously the public receives
no benefit from increased exposure to radioactive materials--they remain
quite controversial.</P>

<P>Here you will find files on a variety of decommissioning and deregulation
issues. For related information, see <A HREF="../../llw/llwbbs.htm">&quot;low-level&quot;
radioactive waste</A>, <A HREF="../../hlw/hlwbbs.htm">high-level radioactive
waste</A>, <A HREF="/reactor/reacbbs.htm">reactor safety</A>, and <A HREF="/radiation/radbbs.htm">radiation</A>.

<h1>NRC Weekly Information Report</h1>

<p>These are copies of the NRC Commissioner's Weekly Information Report--a
publication prepared for the Commissioners to keep them up-to-date on a
wide variety of nuclear-related issues. Upcoming safety problems, new areas
of controversy--they often show up first here. This is a prime resource
for anyone interested in nuclear power and the workings of the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission. Note: all files are in .txt format, and are not

to how the NRC does things (i.e. inspects reactors, sets safety goals,
etc.), as well as to matters like personnel changes, general speeches by
NRC personnel, etc. If you didn't find what you were looking for elsewhere,
you may well find it here. These files are fully indexed. </P>

<P>Weinberg and Williams, Scientific American </P>

<P>Various forms of solar energy, including wind and biomass, offer environmentally
benign ways to generate electricity and make fuels. Some technologies will
be cost competitive before the year 2000. This article gives an excellent
introduction to solar power. (Solar power includes wind and biomass since
the energy originally comes from the sun.) </P>

<P><B>DEC-1000</B> $10.00 updated periodically </P>

<P>Decommissioning Packet </P>

<P>Literature includes an IAEA paper on decommissioning as well as a list
of decommissioned nukes and a Groundswell article. </P>

<P><B>DEC-2000</B> $1.80 18pp 1/88 </P>

<P>&quot;Decommissioning at Ground Level&quot; </P>

<P>Dr. M.J. Pasqualetti, Land Use Policy </P>

<P>This paper uses evidence from England's Sizewell Inquiry that associates
generic and geosocial uncertainties with decommissioning. Some conclusions
are that decommissioning costs are underestimated: further nuclear development
should await decommissioning experience; and decommissioning should be
included in all future nuclear policy decisions. </P>

<P><B>DEC-2001</B> $1.00 10pp 7/89-8/89 </P>

<P>&quot;Breaking Up is Hard to Do&quot; </P>

<P>Cynthia Pollock Shea, World Watch Magazine </P>

<P>&quot;Nuclear power may (be pricing) itself out of existence, but that
still leaves the question of what to do with the radioactive remains of
hundreds of worn-out power plants.&quot; This is a good overview of the
decommissioning problem </P>

<P><B>DEC-2002</B> $1.60 16pp 1989 </P>

<P>&quot;Introducing the Geosocial Context of Nuclear Decommissioning:
US. and Great Britain&quot; </P>

<P>Martin J. Pasqualetti, Geoforum </P>

<P>&quot;Public recognition and the potential for public impact on decommissioning
policy is increasing in both countries, although government agencies and
utilities are taking little account of it. This article uses experience
in the US and Great Britain to address the question of what the geosocial
context of nuclear decommissioning is...&quot; </P>

<P><B>DEC-2003</B> $1.50 15pp 1994 </P>

<P>&quot;Some Background on Decommissioning&quot; </P>

<P>Jonathan M. Block </P>

funds, TVA and decommissioning as an unresolved problem. Although decommissioning
costs have risen, not much else has changed. </P>

<P><B>DEC-3001</B> $.60 6pp 4/89 </P>

<P>&quot;The Decommissioning of Nuclear Plant&quot; </P>

<P>Gordon MacKerron, Energy Policy </P>

<P>Postponement of decommissioning is caused more by the inadequacy of
&quot;storage&quot; places rather than by design. A balance of environmental
considerations, policy and regulation, will ultimately decide decommissioning's
future course. </P>

<P><B>DEC-3002</B> $1.20 12pp 10/89 </P>

<P>&quot;When a Nuclear Reactor Dies, $98 million is a Cheap Funeral&quot;
</P>

<P>&quot;Nuclear Power Plant Decommissioning: Cost Estimation for Planning
and Rate Making&quot; </P>

<P>Bernow and Biewald, Public Utilities Fortnightly </P>

<P>&quot;The authors of this article analyze the differences between site-specific
and generic cost estimates [of decommissioning] and suggest the use of
process contingency factors as a means of providing more accurate projections
of decommissioning costs.&quot; </P>

<P><B>DEC-5000</B> $1.70 17pp not dated </P>

<P>&quot;State Regulation of Decommissioning Costs&quot; </P>

<P>Peter Strauss and James Kelsey, The Energy Journal </P>

<P>The states have the responsibility for setting rates for decommissioning
fund accumulation. This excerpt tells how factors such as plant size, number
of units, and the amount of funding for site restoration, influence state
utility commissions. </P>

<P><B>DEC-5001</B> $1.00 10pp not dated </P>

<P>&quot;Federal Regulation of Decommissioning Economics&quot; </P>

<P>Robert Wood, The Energy Journal </P>

<P>The author introduces us to the regulations and financial considerations
of NRC regarding decommissioning. Among topics discussed are funding methods
and funding assurance in the event of accident or bankruptcy. </P>

District in California. </P>

<P><B>EC-5000</B> $.50 5pp 7/7/90 </P>

<P>&quot;Do We Really Need Nuclear Generating Companies?&quot; </P>

<P>Bruce Biewald, Public Utilities Fortnightly </P>

<P>Biewald tackles two main industry arguments for continuation/creation
of nuclear generating companies. Are we in danger of electric service blackouts,
if so, would nuclear power be a wise alternative? This article explains
why the author says &quot;no.&quot; </P>

<P><B>EC-5001</B> $1.00 10pp 1983 </P>

<P>&quot;Nuclear Lemon&quot; </P>

<P>Alan Nogee, MASSPIRG </P>

<P>Nogee, using Boston Edison cost estimates, shows how ratepayers would
save as much as $1.5 billion over 25 years by permanently closing the Pilgrim
nuclear plant. This is a good example of a cost analysis report. </P>

<P>Ready or Not III: An Exercise in Futility </P>

<P>NYPIRG </P>

<P>An intervenor observation report which critiques an evacuation exercise
of March 9,1983. The report basically concludes that the evacuation plans
are inadequate and an accident at Indian Point could be disastrous. Even
though this critique was written in 1983, Indian Point has done little
to correct the evacuation plan flaws. </P>

<P>Implications of the Chernobyl-4 Accident for Nuclear Emergency Planning
for the State of New York, MHB Technical Associates </P>

<P>This paper voices concern about similarities between Chernobyl unit
4 and U S reactors, particularly Fitzpatrick, Nine Mile Point 1&amp; 2,
and Shoreham. The report contends that these similarities must be considered
in reassessing the safety systems of plants, the vulnerability of US plants
to serious accidents, and what can be learned about emergency planning
as a result of the Chernobyl accident. </P>

<P>&quot;Planning for Spontaneous Evacuation During a Radiological Emergency&quot;
</P>

<P>J. H. Johnson, Jr., Nuclear Safety: vol. 25, No. 2 </P>

<P>At the time this article was written, FEMA ignored the possibility of
&quot;spontaneous&quot; evacuation resulting from a nuclear power plant
accident. The article presents empirical evidence that, on average, 39%
of the population of Long Island is likely to evacuate spontaneously and
thus cast an evacuation &quot;shadow&quot; extending 25 miles. FEMA has
not currently addressed the &quot;shadow effect&quot; issue. </P>

<P>&quot;Information Planning and the Geographical Context of Radiological
Emergency Management&quot; </P>

<P>Donald Zeigler and James Johnson </P>

<P>Contrary to the contentions of the nuclear industry and official policy
of NRC, this paper contends that informational context of an accident will
not be the main determiner of human behavior with regard to evacuation.
The authors use studies on TMI and Chernobyl disasters as a basis for this
conclusion. </P>

<P>Testimony of Steven C. Sholly Before the Committee on Nuclear Power
Safety, New York State </P>

<P>Steve Sholly, UCS, testifies on behalf of NYPIRG as to why they feel
the emergency evacuation plans in response to a nuclear accident are inadequate.
Among the items discussed are the inadequacy of a 10-mile evacuation radius.
Don't let the date fool you, this piece is timely and wholly relevant.
</P>

<P>Testimony of Michael Mariotte Before the Subcommittee on Energy and
Environment, NIRS </P>

<P>This testimony criticizes the NRC's emergency planning regulations and
guidelines and uses the Chernobyl backdrop to question the safety of operating
plants in the States. NIRS takes to task the NRC proposed rule on local
government cooperation, and cost versus safety considerations. </P>

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Petition to close Haddam Neck</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY>
<H2>NIRS, CAN PETITION NRC TO REVOKE HADDAM NECK'S LICENSE;</H2>
<H2>CHARGE THAT NORTHEAST UTILITIES SHOULD NOT OPERATE ANY REACTORS</H2>
<P>At <I>Monitor </I>presstime, NIRS and the Citizens Awareness Network (CAN)
of Massachusetts and Connecticut were preparing to hold a November 25th press
conference to announce release of a new report and petition to the NRC to
permanently revoke the operating license for Connecticut Yankee's Haddam Neck
reactor.</P>
<P>As reported last issue, Haddam Neck is on the verge of permanent shutdown.
More recently, a Northeast Utilities (operator of and largest shareholder in
Connecticut Yankee) report confirmed that it would be cheaper for
ratepayers--and the utility itself--to close the reactor permanently rather than
to keep it operating.</P>
<P>But Northeast Utilities (NU) has balked at making a final decision on Haddam
Neck, and some of the reactor's owners--apparently worried about decommissioning
costs--reportedly are advocating continued operation of the reactor.</P>
<P>At the November 25 press conference, NIRS and CAN were scheduled to release
a comprehensive report documenting the myriad of safety problems associated with
Haddam Neck, as well as a new formal petition asking the NRC to revoke the
reactor's license.</P>
<P>NIRS and CAN already have submitted a formal allegation to the NRC charging
NU with lying about the design and installation of a key reactor safety
component--which has gone unchallenged for some 28 years.</P>
<P>NIRS and CAN have called for a full investigation of NU's truthfulness in
this matter. The component in question, a critical sump screen, was apparently
not discovered to be mis-installed and not of the &quot;standard&quot; design
claimed by NU until July 1996--although NU steadfastly had claimed it was a
standard set-up since reactor start-up in 1968.</P>
<P>In July, the NRC discovered tons of debris potentially clogging the
reactor's Emergency Core Cooling System as a result of holes in the screen and
other problems related to initial installation.</P>
<P>If NU is found to have deliberately lied to the NRC, then the utility's
qualifications to continue operating its Millstone and Seabrook reactors lie in
serious doubt.</P>
<P>NIRS' report on Haddam Neck detailed a litany of safety problems with the
reactor, ranging from the utility's 1986 admission that it could not afford to
replace its failing steam generators to more recent instances of operator and
mechanical failure to a decades-long failure of NU to maintain the critical
Updated Final Safety Analysis Report--the basic document which describes the
essential condition of the reactor and upon which all operator procedures and
responses are based.</P>
<P>The NIRS/CAN report concludes that Haddam Neck must be permanently shutdown,
and that it would not be economically feasible to even attempt to bring the
plant to NRC safety standards.</P>
<P>The report, and accompanying petition prepared by CAN, also argues that NU
has not shown that it can safely operate the Millstone reactors, which have been
closed since Spring for a variety of safety and management problems.</P>
<P>Particularly galling has been NU's continued pattern of harassment and
intimidation of whistleblower s who have attempted to set NU straight on basic
safety issues.</P>
<P>Northeast long has attempted to claim that it is too reliant on nuclear
power to close its reactors. But this summer, with all four of its Connecticut
reactors closed, the lights stayed on....</P>
<P>A copy of the NIRS report is available <A HREF="cypaper.htm">here</A>, or
on paper for $10 from NIRS.</P>

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>U.S. Ecology threatens to sue U.S. Scientists</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY>
<H2>U.S. ECOLOGY THREATENS TO SUE U.S. SCIENTISTS OVER WARD VALLEY TESTS</H2>
<P>In an unprecedented move, U.S. Ecology, the state-chosen contractor for the
proposed Ward Valley radioactive waste dump, has threatened to sue scientists
working under contract for the U.S. government for conducting their
government-sponsored research.</P>
<P>The dispute has stopped all scientific research on the proposed Ward Valley
site.</P>
<P>The U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) is attempting to carry out tests
on Ward Valley safety issues, especially the possible migration of radionuclides
into the Colorado River--the major drinking water source for southern
California.</P>
<P>The Department had hired two scientists under contract, and the Lawrence
Livermore Laboratory, to conduct the tests.</P>
<P>But U.S. Ecology wrote to the scientists, according to the Los Angeles Times
stating, &quot;should you continue your participation in Interior's ill-advised
project, please do so based on the knowledge that US Ecology intends to seek
compensation from any persons or entities whose conduct wrongfully injures its
interests in this manner.&quot;</P>
<P>That was enough to stop the scientists from working. Martin Mifflin, one of
the National Academy of Science members working on the project, told the <I>Los
Angeles Times</I>, &quot;In my experience, it is unprecedented to get that kind
of letter for considering a contract to do applied science. It's my profession.
But even if a legal action is entered into just for harassment purposes, the
court costs could be more than the entire contract is going to pay me.&quot;</P>
<P>The U.S. government is not allowed to indemnify private contractors--which
these scientists are--from lawsuits from private firms.</P>
<P>U.S. Ecology, which already has received a license from the State of
California to build the shallow landfill dump, apparently wants Congress to pass
legislation to transfer the federal land where the dump would be built to
California--which would hire US Ecology--without further tests.</P>
<P>But the Department of Interior, which has control of the land, has, under
pressure from grassroots activists, Sen. Barbara Boxer, and others, insisted the
tests are necessary before any land transfer can be made.</P>
<P>In this case, U.S. Ecology may have overreached. The proposed Ward Valley
dump is unpopular among California voters--it obtains support primarily from
Governor Wilson's administration and a few pharmaceutical companies and nuclear
utilities.</P>
<P>And the suit may harden Clinton administration opposition to Ward Valley.
Deputy DOI Secretary John Garamendi called the US Ecology letters &quot;raw
intimidation,&quot; and said, &quot;It's a disgusting effort to deny the people
of California scientific assurance that the Ward Valley site won't put their
health and safety at risk.&quot;</P>
<P>Considering that Congress has not been able to pass legislation turning the
site over to California, US Ecology's latest move smacks of desperation--it is
unlikely to convince Congressmembers who might prefer objective scientific
evidence about the suitability of the site to contractor scare tactics. And it
may cause some Members to ask if U.S. Ecology is trying to hide something.</P>
<P>As reported earlier in the <I>Monitor</I>, US Ecology is said to be in
serious financial trouble. This seems to have sparked a new emphasis on
confronting opponents to its plans. Recently, the firm went so far as to sue a
local Texas environmental group, Mothers Organized to Stop Environmental Sins
(MOSES), which has complained about a deep-well injection site for hazardous
waste operated by the firm.</P>
<P><B>WHAT YOU CAN DO</B></P>
<P>Write to President Clinton and demand that he stand firm against U.S.
Ecology and its scare tactics. Address: The White House, 1600 Pennsylvania
Avenue, NW, Washington DC 20500</P>

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>DOE prepared to use MOX</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY>
<H2>DOE PREPARED TO APPROVE USE OF MOX FUEL</H2>
<P>At <I>Monitor</I> presstime, the Department of Energy was preparing to
issue a document clearing the way for use of plutonium-based, or MOX
(mixed-oxide) fuel in commercial nuclear reactors.</P>
<P>A Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) on plutonium &quot;disposition&quot;
options was expected to recommend that at least a portion, and perhaps as much
as 2/3 of the plutonium reclaimed from the U.S. nuclear weapons arsenal be
converted to fuel for nuclear reactors.</P>
<P>Because conversion of reactors and preparation of the MOX fuel would be more
expensive that conventional uranium-based fuel, DOE seemed prepared to pay the
utilities to use the hybrid fuel--a potential boon for utilities already facing
increased competition and aging nuclear reactors.</P>
<P>At least 17 utilities have expressed some interest in converting their
reactors to use MOX fuel, although only about 4 or 5 are expected to receive
final DOE approval for the concept.</P>
<P>Outgoing DOE secretary Hazel O'Leary will have 30 days to announce a final
decision on MOX use once the FEIS is released. She is expected to endorse the
MOX option.</P>
<P>Said NIRS executive director Michael Mariotte, &quot;We will join with
grassroots groups and citizens across the country to defeat the MOX proposal.
Use of MOX fuel would increase nuclear proliferation risks, undercut U.S.
efforts to stop a worldwide plutonium economy, allow operation of uneconomical
and unsafe nuclear reactors, put more plutonium and other highly-radioactive
elements into the so-called &quot;low-level&quot; radioactive waste stream, and
cause a nightmare of nuclear materials transportation.</P>
<P>This option must be stopped, and it will be stopped,&quot; Mariotte said.</P>
<P>Instead, the DOE must continue to research methods to contain the plutonium
found in nuclear warheads, Mariotte said. &quot;Spreading plutonium around the
United States, on railroad cars, on trucks, and out reactor emission pipes just
isn't acceptable,&quot; he added.</P>
<P>The U.S. government has for decades opposed the use of plutonium as a
nuclear fuel in an effort to convince other countries not to embark on a
plutonium-based method of generating electricity. Instead, the U.S. consistently
has called for plutonium to be carefully regulated and stored in a manner that
would preclude terrorist or other illegal seizures of the material.</P>
<P>By even considering the MOX option, the DOE is breaking that decades-long
commitment to nuclear non-proliferation, in favor of subsidizing a few nuclear
utilities whose reactors could not afford to meet competitive pressures.</P>
<P>To make matters worse, the DOE also is considering the a two-pronged
strategy for tritium production. One side would be construction of an
accelerator at Savannah River, the other side would be to allow commercial
reactors to produce tritium for nuclear weapons.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>&quot;This  DOE plan would completely break down every argument
that there is a difference between commercial nuclear power and the nuclear
weapons complex,&quot; said Mariotte. &quot;In fact, once 'commercial' reactors
start producing materials for nuclear warheads, they are part of the same
military-industrial-utility complex that President Eisenhower warned us against.&quot;</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>&quot;Again, it will be the grassroots groups and concerned
citizens who will stop this nutty idea. People know what's best for their
communities and their lives, even when they have a hard time convincing DOE of
that.&quot;</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>WHAT YOU CAN DO</B></P>
<P>During December, call and fax Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary and urge her to
reject the MOX and tritium-production options. Let the White House know as well.
Contact NIRS for more information.</P>

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Nuclear Notes, November 1996</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY>
<H2>NUCLEAR NOTES</H2>
<H2>FROM THE CAPITOL CITY...</H2>
<P>*Embarrassed by the March 1996 <I>Time Magazine</I> story about the NRC's
lack of regulatory zeal, NRC Chair Shirley Jackson has taken several steps
recently that make NRC look like, gasp, an actual regulator:</P>
<P>.The NRC has told all utilities still using <B>Thermo-Lag</B> to complete
removal and replacement of the substance by the end of 1997. A number of
utilities had been holding out for a year 2000-date. The agency also rejected
the Nuclear Energy Institute's proposed fire protection rule rewrite, and
directed the staff to come up with a new version by the end of February 1997.</P>
<UL>
<LI>The NRC has told utilities to document, by early Spring, whether their
reactors are in compliance with their <B>Updated Final Safety Analysis Reports</B>
(a major problem at Haddam Neck and Millstone). Reactors not in compliance
apparently will have a very short time to get into compliance.
</LI>
<LI>Following up on the discovery of the use of porous concrete for the basemat
at Millstone-3, the NRC examined records and wrote to five utilities demanding
information about their use of <B>porous concrete</B>. The plants were: Beaver
Valley-1 &amp; 2; Fitzpatrick; Haddam Neck; North Anna- &amp; 2; Surry-1 &amp;
2; and Perry.
</LI>
</UL>
<P>On the other hand, at a recent Commissioners' meetings on containment
degradation, Chairwoman Jackson heard the following from NRC staff:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>&quot;The key point is that the number of incidents of
degradation is increasing. That is an important point to note.&quot;</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>&quot;Corrosion has been found in the sand cushion area [of GE
Mark I reactors] which transitions from the embedded concrete just below the
vent pipes. That is on the outside surface of the steel shell....Also, inside
the wet well, near the free surface of the water, that is where the waster is in
contact with the steel shell. That is where corrosion has been found.&quot;</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>&quot;This is a picture looking at the dry well shell from the
outside, putting a camera inside the sand cushion area. It is a very small
opening, and it does show two extensive areas of rust...This picture shows the
steel shell area which is in contact with the sand cushion. The lower portion of
the picture, you see the sand cushion, and in the upper right-hand corner, the
interface goes right through the middle of the picture. You can see the steel
shell.&quot;</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>&quot;Now this is instructive. People think that structures are
built forever, especially those made out of concrete. One is built to last
forever, but this one clearly didn't. It is on the top of a dome somewhere on
the containment structure, and that is the extent of spalling of concrete that
was observed.&quot;</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>&quot;This rule [containment inspection] became effective...on
September 9, 1996. With an expedited implementation period, the inspections are
to be completed by all utilities by September of 2001...&quot;</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Chairman Jackson: &quot;Given the general and accelerated rates that you
talked about, how long would it take for there to be corrosion below some
acceptable wall thickness level or strength level?&quot;</P>
<P>Mr. Bagchi [NRC staff]: &quot;We can discover one tomorrow.&quot;</P>
<P>Jackson's [and staff's] conclusion: don't worry, it can all be repaired....</P>
<P>* The German corporation <B>Siemens Power</B> met with NRC officials in
late October to discuss the company's plans to get a Department of Energy
contract to produce MOX (mixed-oxide, or plutonium-based) fuel for commercial
reactors (see related story, this issue). Siemens already has a uranium fuel
production license for its Richland, Washington facility. The NRC says it told
Siemens it would need a new license to produce plutonium fuel, under 10 CFR 70.</P>
<P>In other Siemens news, an international boycott has been launched against
the company during December 1996 for its role in the construction of the
controversial Mochovce reactor in Slovakia. More than 400 organizations
worldwide have joined the effort. In the U.S., Siemens' primary consumer
products are Osram, Sylvania and Bosch lightbulbs and other lighting goods.</P>
<P>*The NRC has launched a new &quot;on-line discussion&quot; of the <B>Licensing
Support System</B> for a high-level waste repository (read: Yucca Mountain).</P>
<P>Anyone interested in high-level waste and/or Yucca Mountain should try to
get involved and get your views known as clearly as possible. The discussion is
taking place on the Internet, at http://lssnet.llnl.gov The discussion continues
through May 20.</P>
<P>*Whistleblower David Lochbaum has joined the <B>Union of Concerned
Scientists</B> in the position previously held by Robert Pollard. Lochbaum has
worked as a contractor at numerous nuclear plants, most recently Haddam Neck. In
1992, he and fellow engineer Donald Prevatte disclosed a generic problem with
Susquehanna's irradiated fuel pool with which the NRC still is grappling. NIRS
has worked with Lochbaum for several years, and we look forward to working with
him for many years--we knew there remained a reason for our offices to be next
door to those of UCS....</P>
<H2>...AND IN THE STATES</H2>
<P><B>District of Columbia: </B>The Office of the People's Counsel will hold a
meeting December 4, 1996 to discuss the proposed merger of <B>Pepco and
Baltimore Gas &amp; Electric Co</B>. A number of merger opponents will attend.
Among the key issues are how the proposed merger would affect utility
competition and how to protect Pepco ratepayers from costs associated with BG&amp;E's
Calvert Cliffs reactors. The meeting will be held at the Martin Luther King
Library, 901 G Street NW, Wednesday, December 4, from noon-2:30 pm.</P>
<P><B>Illinois:</B> An October inspection of LaSalle-2's pressure suppression
pool uncovered &quot;a significant inventory of foreign material&quot; including
a 3-foot by 3-foot rubber mat, a 3-foot by 3-foot gasket and a six-foot by
four-foot nylon bag. <B>Commonwealth Edison</B> believes the material has been
there since the reactor went online twelve years ago. The amount of material
would have clogged the Emergency Core Cooling System strainers by more than 50%,
according to the NRC, leading to doubt that the system would have worked if
needed. A similar level of material was recently found at New York's Nine Mile
Point-2 reactor.</P>
<P><B>Louisiana:</B> Fourteen prominent civil and human rights activists,
including nine members of Congress, sent a letter November 19 asking NRC Chair
Shirley Jackson to deny a license to the proposed <B>Louisiana Energy Services</B>
uranium enrichment plant.</P>
<P>Signers included Rev. Dr. Joseph Lowery, president of the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference; Rev. Dr. Joan Brown Campbell, General Secretary of the
National Council of Churches; Bishop Thomas L. Hoyt of the Christian Methodist
Episcopal Church; Marc Morail, Mayor of New Orleans; Actress Jane Fonda; and
Representatives John Conyers, Ronald Dellums, Cleo Fields, Jesse L. Jackson,
Jr., John Lewis, Cynthia McKinney, Eleanor Holmes Norton, Donald Payne, and
Maxine Waters--the newly-elected chair of the Congressional Black Caucus.</P>
<P>The letter said that President Clinton's executive order on environmental
justice has &quot;been largely ignored LES and the NRC,&quot; and that LES &quot;seems
doomed to become another example of an expensive, pollution emitting nuclear
facility that will never be profitable--all at the expense of two poor African
American communities.&quot;</P>
<P><B>Massachusetts:</B> The NRC waived a potential $100,000 fine on <B>Boston
Edison</B> for potential containment degradation at the Pilgrim reactor. The
reason for the waiver: the NRC said that the utility identified the problem
(which involved faulty circuit breakers) and fixed it within four hours.</P>
<P>Fair enough, except that the utility first identified the problem in 1991,
and again in 1993, and didn't even report it, much less fix it. And the problem
existed, according to the NRC, since at least 1988 and perhaps since reactor
start-up in 1972.</P>
<P>It appears the agency may not be learning anything from the
Millstone/Northeast Utilities travesty, after all....</P>
<P><B>Minnesota:</B> The Prairie Island Coalition has sued the State of
Minnesota over private meetings held by state agencies with <B>Northern States
Power</B> (NSP).</P>
<P>At issue are discussions several state agencies held with NSP on the
utility's settlement with Westinghouse on its lawsuit over faulty steam
generators. The Coalition was an interested party to that suit and has been to
court to obtain secret Westinghouse documents about steam generator problems.</P>
<P>NSP and Westinghouse would prefer that the terms of the suit, and especially
relevant documents, be kept out of the public eye. The Coalition suit charges
the state agencies did not keep records of their meetings with NSP, contrary to
state law.</P>
<P><B>New York:</B> The deal was announced with much fanfare and publicity:
the <B>Entergy Corporation</B>, which operates reactors in Mississippi,
Louisiana, and Arkansas, was moving to New York to take over the operations of
the <B>New York Power Authority's</B> troubled Indian Point and Fitzpatrick
reactors.</P>
<P>The reality proved a little different, however, and in early November, very
quietly, NYPA announced that the deal wasn't happening after all. Apparently,
the two sides just couldn't agree on terms of the contract, though no details
were released. NYPA will continue to operate its reactors and Entergy will stay
in the South.</P>
<P><B>Ohio:</B> Centerior Energy was hit with two major fines in October. The
first, for $160,000 was for employment discrimination at the <B>Perry </B>reactor.
Five workers, who were involved in litigation against Centerior as a result of
their exposure to radioactive material at the utility's Davis-Besse reactor,
were refused access to Perry, and thus could not be hired by a contractor. A
sixth worker, who already had been hired, was fired. The six took their case to
the Department of Labor, where their case is still pending. But the NRC decided
the employees' grievance was valid and issued the fine.</P>
<P>The second fine against Centerior was for $50,000 and stemmed for
uncorrected fire protection violations at the <B>Davis-Besse</B> reactor.</P>
<P><B>Pennsylvania:</B> University of North Carolina scientists have released
a new study that suggests higher levels of radiation were released during the
1979 <B>Three Mile Island-2</B> accident than so far have been revealed.</P>
<P>The researchers, led by Dr. Steven Wing of the UNC School of Public Health,
re-examined data from a 1990 Columbia University study which concluded the
accident was not responsible for increased cancer rates in the area, because the
radiation exposures were too low.</P>
<P>Rather than start with the utility's stated radiation releases, however,
Wing and his co-workers started with the health effects in the area. They found
that leukemia and lung cancer rates downwind of TMI were five to ten times
higher than upwind.</P>
<P>Said Wing, &quot;I would be the first to say that our study doesn't prove by
itself that there were high-level radiation exposures, but it part of a body of
evidenced that is consistent with high exposures. If you say that there was no
high radiation, then you are left with higher cancer rates downwind of the plume
that are otherwise unexplainable.&quot;</P>
<P>The researchers considered smoking and other factors, but did not find them
responsible for the increased cancers downwind.</P>
<P>Wing noted that some plant radiation monitors went off scale during the
accident.</P>
<P>Concluded Wing, &quot;This cancer increase would not be expected to occur
over a short time in the general population unless doses were far higher than
estimated by industry and government authorities. Rather, our findings support
the allegation that the people who reported rashes, hair loss, vomiting and pet
deaths after the accident were exposed to high level radiation and were not only
suffering from emotional stress.&quot;</P>

<H2>PETER BRADFORD ON &quot;STRANDED COSTS&quot;</H2>
<P><I>&quot;There never was such a regulatory compact&quot; [to ensure
recovery of prudent, though &quot;stranded&quot; costs]</I></P>
<P><I>This statement may surprise anyone</I><I> whose involvement in utility
regulation postdates 1985. Since that time, the breaching of the regulatory
compact has been described</I><I> and decried so often and so vociferously that
a causal</I><I> observer might easily believe that this compact</I><I> was a
lesser known outcome of the original Constitutional Convention.&quot;</I></P>
<P><I>&quot;The utility</I><I> claim seems to be that they have an
entitlement [for 'stranded costs'] despite this history because</I><I> the
particular traumas</I><I> of retail</I><I> competition could not</I><I> have
been foreseen. As a factual matter, this claim is dubious. Furthermore, it mocks
the</I><I> notion of risk, which is by is nature not entirely foreseeable.&quot;</I></P>
<P><I>&quot;Utilities assert that their right to recovery extends to every
dollar not disallowed as imprudent. However, regulators know how small a
percentage</I><I> of the total utility</I><I> revenue stream is ever actually
reviewed for prudence. In many states, utilities actively harass regulatory
budgets and appointments</I><I> in a manner hardly consistent with a
statesmanlike compact. Even where such conduct is absent, the probability</I><I>
that regulators have actually</I><I> disallowed every imprudent dollar is zero.&quot;</I></P>
<P><I>&quot;Strandable investment is the public's</I><I> best leverage to an
effectively competitive and an environmentally acceptable future. Regulators,
legislators and others</I><I> in the public sector must not give it away until
that future is well secured.&quot;</I></P>
<P><I>Peter Bradford is a former NRC Commissioner and former Chairman of the
New York Public Service Commission. He currently is a member of the Vermont
Department of Public Service.</I> <I>This is based on a July 16, 1996
presentation to the Vermont Public Service</I><I> Board, reprinted in </I>PUR
Utility Quarterly<I>.</I></P>

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Congress leaves nuclear waste bills behind</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY>
<H2>Victory for Environmentalists!</H2>
<H1>CONGRESS GOES HOME;</H1>
<H1>LEAVES WASTE BILLS BEHIND, SHIFTS $ FROM NUKES TO SUSTAINABLE ENERGY</H1> 
<P>It was described as the &quot;most anti-environmental Congress in history.&quot;</P>
<P>The Republican &quot;revolution&quot; began in January 1995 with a
full-scale attempt to roll back environmental regulations and cut environmental
programs.  Industry lobbyists crowded Capitol Hill hallways and offices, not
just offering their views but actually writing the legislation.</P>
<P>The Nuclear Energy Institute confidently asserted that a bill to create an &quot;interim&quot;
storage site for high-level radioactive waste would be passed and signed by
Christmas 1995.  Proposed &quot;low-level&quot; waste dumps at Ward Valley,
California and Sierra Blanca, Texas would clear their last hurdles.</P>
<P>It didn't turn out quite that way.</P>
<P>Instead, as Congress limped toward adjournment in late September, a
startling realization occurred: a combination of circumstance, conservative
over-reaching, and firm veto threats from President Clinton resulted in the
worst Congressional session for the nuclear power industry ever.</P>
<P>When the dust had cleared and the last Member had left town,
environmentalists' jeers had turned to cheers.</P>
<P><B>Mobile Chernobyl Act</B></P> 
<P>The centerpiece of the nuclear industry's legislative initiatives: interim
storage of waste at Yucca Mountain, Nevada--popularly known as the &quot;Mobile
Chernobyl Act&quot;--never even reached the House floor for a vote.</P>
<P>After the Senate passed Mobile Chernobyl July 31 without enough votes to
override a presidential veto, the Nuclear Energy Institute engaged in an
estimated $1.5 million campaign to try to force Clinton to change his mind. The
effort was concentrated in key election battlegrounds like Michigan, Illinois
and Iowa, and at the Democratic National Convention.</P>
<P>But the campaign, which generated thousands of phone calls to the White
House, had no effect. At the end, without the votes to override a Presidential
veto, the House leadership meekly wrote to President Clinton and asked if he
still planned to veto the bill. For the fifth time, Clinton reaffirmed his
intention to veto Mobile Chernobyl. </P>
<P>And that was it. The House leadership called bill opponent Rep. John Ensign
(R-Nev.) and told him they were pulling the bill (HR 1020, Upton, R-Mich.) from
the floor.</P>
<P>It hadn't been easy: defeating Mobile Chernobyl had required heroic efforts
from Nevada Senators Richard Bryan and Harry Reid, President Clinton's
unwavering resolve to veto the bill, and, most importantly, the work of
thousands of grassroots activists across the country who realized what many
Congressmembers at first did not: that moving high-level radioactive waste
across the country, to a &quot;temporary&quot; site, was dangerous to all
Americans, and benefited only the nuclear industry.</P>
<P>Far from consolidating waste at one spot, as the industry claimed, citizens
quickly realized that implementation of &quot;interim&quot; storage would merely
add one more waste dump to the 110 nuclear reactors still generating waste. And
with 50 million Americans living within one-half mile of likely transport
routes, the stakes for public safety were much higher than Congress had
considered at the beginning of the session.</P>
<P><B>Ward Valley &amp; Sierra Blanca</B></P>
<P>The end of the session sparked a new effort by Senate Energy Committee
Chairman Frank Murkowski (R-Alaska) to force the transfer of federal land to
California for the proposed Wad Valley &quot;low-level&quot; radioactive waste
dump.  Murkowski tried twice to put such legislation on other bills, but both
times a threatened filibuster by Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) and a threatened
veto from President Clinton stopped the measure. </P>
<P>Meanwhile, establishment of a Texas/Maine/Vermont compact, which requires
Congressional approval, also stalled. The House overwhelmingly defeated an
effort to approve the compact in 1995. Since then, compact supporters had been
attempting to marshal enough votes to try again. Apparently, they failed, as the
matter was also left hanging at the end of the session.</P>
<P><B>Changing Priorities</B></P>
<P>Nuclear research and development funding took a big hit this Congress, as
coalitions of environmentalists and budget-cutters took aim at nuclear
pork-barrel projects.</P>
<P>In 1995, Congress eliminated the wasteful gas-cooled reactor program (now
General Atomics, which relied virtually entirely on government spending for its
gas-cooled reactor program as no U.S. utilities expressed meaningful interest in
the project, is trying to sell the idea to Russia for use as a plutonium-burning
reactor).</P>
<P>This year, in the industry's only victory of the Congress, the Advanced
Light Water Reactor (ALWR) narrowly survived extinction. But DOE officials
reportedly have said that the administration will seek to end that program
entirely next year.</P>
<P>Ken Bossong of the Sustainable Energy Coalition reported October 3 that
nuclear programs took $18.6 million in cuts from FY 96 to FY 97 (and FY 96 was
cut from the previous year). $11.6 million was cut from nuclear fusion programs,
$5 million from pyroprocessing and $2 million from the ALWR.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, energy efficiency and renewables programs were increased by $11.4
million from last year, for a total shift away from nuclear and toward
sustainable energy programs of $30 million--a welcome trend.</P>
<P><B>The Next Congress</B></P>
<P>It's probably too early to make any solid predictions about what
nuclear-related legislation the next Congress may consider.</P>
<P>But at least a few things are clear: first, the nuclear industry will be
back, pushing some form of radioactive waste legislation. Rep. Upton already has
promised the industry that he will re-introduce an &quot;interim&quot; storage
bill at the beginning of the next Congress.</P>
<P>Second, whether Democrats or Republicans control the House seems irrelevant:
support for &quot;interim&quot; storage and opposition to Nevada seems likely to
continue. If Republicans win, Rep. Thomas Bliley (R-Va.) seems likely to return
as the House Commerce Committee chair; if the Democrats win, Rep. John Dingell
(D-Mich.), who has clashed with Nevada's Democratic Senators in the past, likely
will return as Chair.</P>
<P>A key question will be whether, if &quot;interim&quot; storage legislation
is passed, President Clinton will maintain his veto posture in a non-election
year. The Nuclear Energy Institute industry already has accused the President of
issuing his veto threat solely to win Nevada's five electoral votes, and
predicts that he will sign a bill next session.</P>
<P>Still, the industry's defeat this Congress, and the growing public
opposition to &quot;interim&quot; storage and unnecessary radioactive waste
transportation, may lead Congress to consider different alternatives. And
environmentalists are likely to be in a stronger position to influence the
debate than they were at the beginning of this Congress.</P>
<P>&quot;Low-level&quot; waste legislation may also receive Congressional
attention next session, but by far the biggest subject Congress will tackle is
utility deregulation. This will take a lot of Congressional time and energy, and
its impact on the future of the nuclear power industry and the drive for
sustainable energy could be substantial.</P>

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Thermal Science fined $900,000</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1>THERMAL SCIENCE FINED $900,000 FOR &quot;DELIBERATE MISCONDUCT&quot; ON
THERMO-LAG STATEMENTS</H1>
<P>The Nuclear Regulatory Commission October 1 fined Thermal Science, Inc.
(TSI) $900,000 for &quot;deliberately providing inaccurate or incomplete
information to the NRC concerning TSI's fire endurance and ampacity testing
programs.&quot; TSI manufacturers the controversial Thermo-Lag fire barrier,
declared &quot;inoperable&quot; by the NRC in 1992.</P>
<P>It was the second-largest fine in agency history, and by far the largest for
a contractor. The NRC issued nine rarely-invoked Severity Level I violations to
TSI. The standard fine for a contractor for such a violation is $10,000 per
violation. But the NRC instead levied its statutory maximum of $100,000 for each
violation &quot;in order for TSI to understand the magnitude of NRC concern that
TSI's actions are unacceptable for a licensee contractor and to provide TSI an
appropriate incentive to ensure that it provides the NRC complete and accurate
information in the future...&quot;</P>
<P>According to a October 1 letter from James Lieberman, Director of NRC's
Office of Enforcement, TSI in writing and in oral statements made by its
president, Rubin Feldman, submitted &quot;inaccurate and/or incomplete
information&quot; about tests conducted on its Thermo-Lag fire barrier. The
inaccurate statements began in October 1991 and continued through August 1992,
according to the letter.</P>
<P>Wrote Lieberman, &quot;These misrepresentations include statements by TSI
that 1) Thermo-Lag products had been subjected to independent testing; 2) TSI
had no knowledge of deviations from its installation procedures; and 3)
Underwriter's Laboratories (UL) had total control of ampacity testing performed
at UL facilities and that these test results were the 'most conservative data'
available to TSI. Contrary to TSI's representations, the NRC's review has
determined that: (1) Thermo-Lag product test was actually performed by TSI with
only minimal involvement of ITL [Independent Testing Laboratories]; (2) TSI had
knowledge of installation deviations occurring at licensee facilities; and (3)
the ampacity derating tests performed at UL were not under the total control of
UL and the data presented by TSI concerning these tests was not 'the most
conservative data' available to TSI.&quot;</P>
<P>The charges are similar, though at least in some cases not identical, to
those prosecuted by the Justice Department in a criminal trial of TSI and Rubin
Feldman last year. Both were acquitted of those charges.</P>
<P>Trial observers believed that a key reason for the acquittal was the NRC's
failure to order the material removed and replaced from the nation's reactors.
After all, if the NRC thought the barrier was so bad why didn't they remove it.
If it was good enough to still be used, then why prosecute the company, seemed
to be the jury's reasoning.</P>
<P>In a written statement, TSI said it will contest the fine, and noted that &quot;since
the trial, the NRC has continued to approve the use of Thermo-Lag in nuclear
plants.&quot;</P>
<P>TSI will first appeal the fine to the NRC staff, then the Commissioners, and
then likely in court.</P>
<P>At one point, Thermo-Lag was used as a primary fire barrier in some 79
reactors. However, a number of utilities have either removed the material or
taken other measures, so that 46 reactors are now still relying on Thermo-Lag
for their fire barriers.</P>
<P>NIRS, which first filed a petition calling for the removal of Thermo-Lag in
mid-1992, repeated its demand that the material be removed and replaced from all
the nation's reactors immediately.</P>
<P>Said Paul Gunter, Director of NIRS' Reactor Watchdog Project, &quot;The NRC
has now fined the company for lying about its product's quality but all that has
been done by the industry and the regulator is to paper over the problem. As
long as the NRC and the utilities have been aware of this problem, they have
only been able to generate stacks of paper that would really be more effective
as a fire barrier than Thermo-Lag itself.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>&quot;The NRC should have ordered this combustible material
removed and replaced years ago,&quot; continued Gunter. &quot;Because of a
multimillion-dollar price tag to remove Thermo-Lag and replace it with a fire
barrier that works, the nuclear utilities have successfully stalled any
effective action to protect the public in the event of fire.&quot;</P>

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Haddam Neck on verge of shutdown</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1>HADDAM NECK ON VERGE OF PERMANENT SHUTDOWN</H1>
<P>Northeast Utilities' (NU) Haddam Neck reactor, also known as Connecticut
Yankee, may be on the verge of a permanent shutdown following a series of
mechanical problems, new discoveries of inadequate construction, and safety
lapses compounded by a bleak economic outlook.</P>
<P>The utility is now conducting an internal review of the economics of the
reactor, as a prelude to making a decision about its future. Its report is due
to be completed by the end of October.</P>
<P>The rumor among plant workers is that the economic review will conclude that
Haddam Neck should remain open, because Northeast would be too embarrassed to
close its only Connecticut reactor not currently on the NRC's problem plants
list (all three of NU's Millstone reactors are on the list).</P>
<P>But recent revelations about deficiencies at Haddam Neck, as well as a
serious safety incident on September 1, 1996, raise serious doubts about the
reactor's continued viability.</P>
<P>A September 12, 1996 NRC inspection report, for example,  found that some of
the plant's emergency core cooling system piping is too small to provide enough
water to prevent a meltdown under worst-case scenarios. The NRC said this &quot;significantly
compromised plant safety.&quot; </P>
<P>Moreover, the piping is original to the plant, meaning this condition has
existed for the past 28 years. Northeast did not report the condition to the NRC
until July of this year.</P>
<P>The importance of this was underscored by the September 1 incident, which
the NRC has described as a &quot;significant precursor event.&quot; In fact,
according to the NRC, the Haddam Neck came within 52 minutes of boiling off the
water covering the reactor vessel.</P>
<P>The incident began on August 28, when through operator error a nitrogen
bubble began to form in the reactor vessel, displacing the water. According to
an NRC account of the incident, &quot;Operators were unaware of actual reactor
vessel level during this event,&quot; and &quot;Reactor vessel level decreased
to approximately 2 1/2 feet about the point of RHR [residual heat removal] pump
cavitation.&quot;</P>
<P>To make matters worse, the &quot;A&quot; residual heat removal heat
exchanger was removed from service on August 31 due to a leak, and the &quot;B&quot;
RHR pump was found to be inoperable.</P>
<P>Said the NRC, &quot;The loss of RHR procedure requires the charging pumps be
operable to refill the RCS (reactor coolant system). These pumps were not
available during this event...If the RHR system was lost, timely restoration of
forced circulation using a reactor coolant pump would have been
difficult...Nitrogen gas could have adversely impacted the ability of the steam
generators to remove decay heat by natural circulation.&quot; A low pressure
injection system would have been the only system available to attempt to cool
the reactor.</P>
<P>However, the nitrogen gas bubble stabilized on its own, and the emergency
systems were not needed.</P>
<P>The NRC harshly criticized NU for the event, citing numerous instances of
poor procedure quality, failure to implement procedures, &quot;lack of a
questioning attitude,&quot; inappropriate decision-making, lack of
instrumentation, inadequate training, poor equipment condition, and untimely
technical response, among other citations. A sizable fine and numerous
violations are likely.</P>
<P>Other problems at Haddam Neck include a number of errors in the plant's
Updated Final Safety Analysis Report. These are critical, since emergency
procedures are based on this report--errors can mean adoption of unsound
procedures to follow in an emergency. It seems likely that the NRC would require
NU to examine and correct the document before restart--a labor-intensive and
lengthy process.</P>
<P>In addition, an August 1, 1996 NRC inspection report found that &quot;engineering
calculations and analyses relied on to assure the adequacy of the design of key
safety systems, such as station batteries, emergency diesel generators,
containment air recirculation system and service waster system, were incomplete
or incorrect.&quot;</P>
<P>Replacing the emergency core cooling piping would be another expensive
proposition--the ten-inch piping throughout the plant would have be replaced
with twelve-inch pipes.</P>
<P>The reactor's steam generators are in poor shape, and as far back as 1993 NU
(and the NRC as well) concluded that it would not be economical to replace them.</P>
<P>There are also cracks in the containment, and as reported in the July 1996
<I>Nuclear Monitor,</I> numerous  or inadequate bolts and welds in the
structure supporting the main feedwater piping.</P>
<P>Further, among at least six criteria the NRC has listed for restart, one
involves NU obtaining a license amendment--which may give activists  an
opportunity to raise issues before an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board.
Already, activists are gearing up to challenge NU on a wide variety of safety
issues.</P>
<P>It seems apparent that NU cannot successfully operate five nuclear reactors
(Haddam Neck, Millstone &amp; Seabrook). At this point, despite the rumors, it
appears Haddam Neck will be the first to go. The bigger question is whether NU
can successfully operate any reactors.</P>

<BODY>
<H1>Democrats and Republicans on Energy Policy</H1>
<P><B>Here is the complete text of the Democratic Party's platform on energy:</B></P>
<P>&quot;We reject the Republican myth that energy efficiency and environmental
protection are enemies of economic growth. We will make our economy more
efficient, by using less energy, reducing our dependence on foreign oil, and
producing less solid and toxic waste. We will adopt a coordinated transportation
policy, with a strong commitment to mass transit; encourage efficient
alternative-fueled vehicles; increase our reliance on clean natural gas; promote
clean coal technology; invest in R&amp;D on renewable energy sources; strengthen
efforts to prevent air and water pollution; support incentives for domestic oil
and gas operations; and push for revenue-neutral incentives that reward
conservation, prevent pollution and encourage recycling.&quot;</P>
<P><B>Following are excerpts from the Republican Party platform on energy:</B></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>&quot;Nowhere has the failure of presidential leadership been
more apparent than in Clinton's position on finding a reasonable long-term
solution to our Nation's nuclear waste disposal problem. We support the federal
government's obligation under contract to take possession of nuclear waste and
remove it from temporary storage in over 30 states across the country. At the
same time, we believe that the siting and licensing of both permanent and
interim storage facilities should be based on sound science and not solely upon
political expediency.&quot;</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>And: &quot;Because no single source of energy can reliably supply the needs
of the American people, we believe in fostering alternative &amp; renewable
energy sources to assist in reducing dependence on unreliable foreign oil
supplies. We anticipate the continuing development of energy from coal, oil,
natural gas, agricultural products such as ethanol and biodiesel, nuclear &amp;
hydro sources, &amp; where economically competitive from wind, solar &amp;
geothermal power.&quot;</P>

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Nuclear Notes October 1996</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1>Nuclear Notes</H1>
<H2>From the Capitol City...</H2>
<P>The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has its full five members for the first
time since 1992. President Clinton named Dr. Nils Diaz and Edward McGaffigan,
Jr. to the Commission in July; they began work in August.</P>
<P>Dr. Diaz was a professor of nuclear engineering at the University of Florida
and Director of the Innovative Nuclear Space Power and Propulsion Institute for
the Ballistic Missile Defense Initiative. He also has been a consultant to
Spain's nuclear regulatory commission.</P>
<P>Edward McGaffigan was a senior policy advisor to Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.)
and a former science attache to the U.S. Embassy in Moscow.</P>
<H2>...AND IN THE STATES</H2>
<P><B>California: </B>Utility deregulation and restructuring are on the way.
Utilities already are preparing--slashing costs and, in many cases, nuclear
safety--for the new era of electricity competition. Anti-nuclear and
environmental activists had better get ready too, lest the experience of
California is repeated nationwide.</P>
<P>Governor Pete Wilson September 23 signed a bill, passed unanimously by the
state legislature, to restructure the state's utility industry and promote
competition.</P>
<P>Despite its widespread support, the new law appears to be a disaster for
ratepayers and the environment.</P>
<P>For example, it allows the state's utilities to collect all of their &quot;stranded
costs,&quot; or, as the California Public Utilities Commission calls them &quot;utility-related
uneconomic costs.&quot; Uneconomic is right, these costs are actually nearly $30
billion in nuclear plant construction costs for Diablo Canyon, San Onofre and
Palo Verde. California ratepayers will have to pay these costs in full under an
accelerated schedule--in the next five years. Some analysts estimate these
charges alone will make up a third of the average residential electric bill,
even for those who choose to purchase electricity from non-nuclear sources.</P>
<P>After 2001, when their reactors are paid off, the nuclear utilities will
have to compete on a more even playing scale. This will, of course, encourage
the utilities to cut costs just about the time these reactors reach the ranks of
the prematurely aging and need greater maintenance and spending. It's a nuclear
safety nightmare that could be repeated across the country.</P>
<P>Had California chosen not to allow these uneconomical &quot;stranded costs&quot;
to be passed on to consumers, the utilities probably would have had to close
their reactors next year--a far better outcome for all concerned.</P>
<P>This scenario will play out in state after state over the next several
years, and possibly in Congress next session as well. Activists need to bone up
on their utility economics and on how to influence their state public utility
commissions and legislatures.</P>
<P>NIRS is now beginning work on new materials to help activists in this
process.</P>
<P><B>New Jersey:</B> 133,000 gallons of contaminated water September 19
spilled into Oyster Creek, which runs next to the reactor of the same name. The
incident occurred when reactor water accidentally was fed into a water system
that discharges into the creek, and caused elevated radiation levels in the
water. It took plant workers almost 24 hours to realize what had occurred. </P>
<P><B>Texas: </B>Formation of a Texas/Maine/Vermont &quot;low-level&quot;
waste compact may be stalled in Congress, but efforts to turn West Texas into a
national dumping ground for radioactive and hazardous waste are well underway.</P>
<P>Not only is Texas moving ahead with licensing proceedings for the proposed
Sierra Blanca commercial &quot;low-level&quot; radioactive waste dump, but up
the road a piece--not far by Texas standards--two companies are attempting to
build separate radioactive and mixed radioactive/hazardous waste dumps.</P>
<P>A little-known company called Waste Control Specialists (WCS) is now
building the Disneyland of hazardous waste sites in Andrews County along the New
Mexico state line. Already, WCS has secured permits from the EPA for landfill &quot;disposal&quot;
of all types of hazardous wastes at a 10,000,000 cubic-yard &quot;common hole&quot;
or landfill; two 637,000 cubic-yard &quot;condo repositories&quot; for those
who'd like to segregate their waste; and warehouse storage facilities for up to
5,000 drums of dioxin materials or other hazardous waste.</P>
<P>Not only that, but WCS envisions kind of a toxic waste theme park,  with the
landfill, &quot;condos,&quot; and warehouses literally surrounded by university,
private, and government waste technology research centers. Already, Battelle
Memorial Institute and Texas A&amp;M University have signed up.</P>
<P>But potentially exposing the people of Andrews County to dioxins and other
toxics apparently isn't enough. Though the hazardous site is still under
construction, WCS is already moving to its next step. It is seeking permission
to also store &quot;low-level&quot; radioactive waste and by-product materials
including mine and mill tailings, as well as NARM and NORM waste and other
by-product materials (perhaps depleted uranium?).</P>
<P>Apparently WCS is attempting to become a national dumping ground for &quot;low-level&quot;
radioactive waste from the Department of Energy nuclear weapons  complex as well
as other non-utility generated radioactive materials.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, Envirocare, which runs a dump for NARM/NORM and some other &quot;low-level&quot;
radioactive waste in Utah, September 26 announced that it plans to apply to the
State of Texas to build a new &quot;low-level&quot; and mixed
radioactive/hazardous waste dump--also in Andrews County.</P>
<P>There appears to be some bad blood between the two companies, and
Envirocare's press release takes great pains to point out that it &quot;historically
has been committed to ensuring that all applicable legal and regulatory
requirement have been met, and will not seek through technical legal means to
escape any such requirements.&quot; </P>
<P>WSC apparently is trying to argue that it only needs a permit from the
federal Department of Energy to store radioactive waste, not a permit from the
state of Texas. </P>
<P>Obtaining a permit from Texas would require open public hearings--something
Envirocare apparently welcomes but WSC would rather avoid.</P>
<P>In any event, the environmental future of Andrews County--and eastern New
Mexico--appears rather dim at this point.</P>

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Clinton pledges to veto S.1271</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1>CLINTON PLEDGES TO VETO &quot;INTERIM&quot; STORAGE BILL; VOTE POSSIBLE IN
JUNE BRYAN AND REID WILL MOUNT FILIBUSTER</H1> 
<P>President Bill Clinton has promised to veto S. 1271 and similar legislation &quot;in
its current form&quot; if it passes the Congress.</P>
<P>In a strongly-worded message, Clinton said he will refuse to sign any
legislation that would establish an &quot;interim&quot; radioactive waste dump
in Nevada before the Department of Energy determines whether Yucca Mountain is
suitable for more-permanent storage.</P>
<P>Clinton's veto message expressed sharp concern that S. 1271 and its House
counterpart, HR 1020, would be exempted from major environmental laws, including
the National Environmental Policy Act, the Clean Air Act and the Safe Drinking
Water Act. Clinton also objected to the bill's overriding of EPA's authority to
set radiation standards for Yucca Mountain and an interim dump.</P>
<P>In a separate statement, the EPA itself took vigorous exception to S. 1271,
stating that its radiation standards of 100 millirems/year are too high, do not
&quot;protect public health,&quot; and are &quot;inconsistent with scientific
findings.&quot;</P>
<P>Clinton's statement came shortly before a Senate vote on S. 1271, scheduled,
perhaps inadvertently, to coincide with the 10th anniversary of the Chernobyl
disaster. Perhaps because of that, or because of fear of a planned filibuster by
Nevada Senators Bryan and Reid, or perhaps because of a letter NIRS put
together, signed by 83 different organizations and accompanied by 30,000
petition signatures, Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole pulled the bill from the
floor.</P>
<P>At <I>Monitor </I>presstime, rumors were circulating that a vote might be
held shortly after Memorial Day. However, Dole's surprise announcement that he
is leaving the Senate by mid-June places the Senate's floor schedule in turmoil.</P>
<P>With Dole gone, for example, it makes it far more likely that a vote on the
bill will actually occur: Dole need not worry about repercussions from
Nevada--which Clinton won in 1992--if the vote occurs after he leaves.</P>
<P>On the other hand, it seems likely--though certainly not definite--that the
Republican leadership would wait for Dole to leave before bringing the bill to a
vote. That way, Dole could say he had nothing to do with it, and would not have
to vote on it.</P>
<P>Although Nevada has only three electoral votes, it is considered a
hotly-contested state in an election many observers believe will be quite
close--despite what public opinion polls say now. And there is no doubt that the
high-level waste issue is a central issue in the state.</P>
<P>Filibuster planned</P>
<P>But another reason Dole has been reluctant to bring S. 1271 to the Senate
floor is that he knows how to count votes.</P>
<P>Senators Richard Bryan and Harry Reid plan to filibuster the bill,  and have
attained the active support of at least a few other Democratic Senators.</P>
<P>To break a filibuster requires 60 votes, and, so far, Dole has not been
convinced that those in favor of S. 1271 have the necessary 60 votes to &quot;invoke
cloture,&quot; or stop the filibuster.</P>
<P>It is fair to say that  counts on both sides show that a &quot;cloture&quot;
vote--to end a filibuster--would be very close.</P>
<P>Moreover, it would take 2/3 of the Senate, or 67 votes, to override a
Presidential veto, and it may be that Dole has not wanted to bring up the bill
unless it were at least possible for an override vote to be successful.</P>
<P>On the House side, House Speaker Newt Gingrich, in a recent speech at a
Nevada fundraiser, said HR 1020 will not come to the House floor until and
unless the Senate passes the measure.</P>
<P>Amendments</P>
<P>A number of possible amendments are expected if the bill does reach the
Senate floor.</P>
<P>For example, Sen. Bennett Johnston (D-La.) is expected to offer amendments
to address Clinton's concerns about the bill--particularly about establishing an
&quot;interim&quot; dump before a permanent one is in place.  Johnston did this
in Senate Energy Committee consideration of the bill, but was overridden by
another amendment by Committee Chairman Frank Murkowski (R-Alaska). In the end,
Johnston could not even bring himself to vote for the bill, and abstained.</P>
<P>Amendments are also expected to delete a section of the bill which allows
for reprocessing of nuclear waste, and Senator Paul Wellstone (D-Minn.)
apparently plans to introduce an amendment which would keep liability for the
waste with the nuclear utilities, rather than taxpayers. </P>
<P>Other amendment are likely as well. Because environmental groups are
uniformly insistent that the entire bill is flawed and must be rejected, they
have not focused, and do not plan to work on, individual amendments. Rather,
environmental groups are gearing up to support the Bryan-Reid filibuster.
Although it's just a procedural issue, the vote on the filibuster will be <I>the</I>
key vote on the bill.</P>
<P>Radioactive Chlorine at Yucca Mountain</P>
<P>Meanwhile, in another blow to dump proponents, radioactive chlorine-36 has
been found by Los Alamos scientists deep below Yucca Mountain.</P>
<P>The element was found some 600 feet below the surface, in an area which is
supposed to be unreachable by outside elements for 1,000 years. Yet the chlorine
could only have come from above-ground nuclear weapons tests conducted less than
50 years ago.</P>
<P>According to Department of Energy guidelines, the Yucca Mountain site will
have to be disqualified if it is found that  groundwater will travel through the
repository within 1,000 years.</P>
<P>WHAT YOU CAN DO</P>
<P>So what does all this mean for environmental activists?</P>
<P>First, let's not sit on our laurels, the battle is far from over.</P>
<P>S. 1271 could still come up for a vote, as soon as early June. Failing that,
it could come up as an amendment to another biill--a budget bill, for example,
which President Clinton might feel he has to sign.</P>
<P>It is vital to keep up the pressure. The Senate is certainly hearing from
the nuclear industry. Apart from spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on
newspaper ads, the nuclear industry is also attempting to mount its own &quot;grassroots&quot;
campaign in favor of S. 1271. They are getting utility employees, nuclear
engineering professors, and others to write letters in support of the bill. In
many cases, Senators are hearing as much or more from nuclear advocates as from
environmental activists.</P>
<P>So, if you haven't yet written to your Senators (Washington DC, 20510), sit
down and do so now. If you haven't yet convinced a friend to write or call, this
is the time. While you're at it, call President Clinton (202-456-1111) and thank
him for his veto message on S. 1271 and urge him to veto it no matter what
amendments might be passed, especially if the bill still overrides basic
environmental laws such as NEPA and the Clean Air Act.. It is bad legislation,
pure and simple.</P>
<P>If you haven't yet sent in your Don't Waste America petitions, we're still
collecting them, and there's still a little time or collect more signatures.</P>
<P>If you haven't written a letter to the editor, why wait? Or call your
favorite (or most hated) radio talk show.</P>
<P>In short, the object is to organize, organize, organize, and to help bring
this issue the attention it deserves. This is one bill that cannot withstand the
light of day, so the more public scrutiny it receives, the less likely it is to
be enacted.</P>

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>State Court Rejects LES Permits</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY>
<P></P>
<H1>STATE COURT REJECTS ALL LES PERMITS; FIRST NRC LICENSING DECISION SAYS LES
MUST MEET EMERGENCY GUIDELINES</H1>
<P>A Louisiana state court has thrown out all of the state environmental
permits granted to Louisiana Energy Services, and told the company to try again.</P>
<P>The state's First Circuit Court of Appeals tossed out the permits based on a
suit brought by Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund (SCLDF) and Citizens Against
Nuclear Trash (CANT), which argued that LES had not complied with state
environmental guidelines.</P>
<P>Louisiana Energy Services (LES) is a consortium of companies, dominated by
the European firm Urenco, which since 1989 has been wanting to build a private
uranium enrichment plant near Homer, Louisiana.</P>
<P>The court ruled that the state's Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ)
had not complied with state law in evaluating the potential environmental
impacts of the proposed LES plant.</P>
<P>The DEQ must now go back and attempt to justify its granting of state
permits. Although the case was brought by SCLDF and CANT on procedural
grounds--that DEQ had not done the work--the two groups now will be able to
challenge DEQ's findings on substantive grounds--including whether the site for
the plant was chosen for environmentally racist reasons.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, which since 1991 has been
hearing contentions on the LES license application, issued its first initial
decision on April 26--the tenth anniversary of Chernobyl.</P>
<P>The decision covered a variety of issues raised by CANT during hearings on
the license, but reflected mostly concerns about emergency planning.</P>
<P>Although the decision essentially approves the license--pending further ASLB
decisions--it also requires LES to meet NRC emergency response standards, as
defined in an agency regulatory guide. LES and NRC had argued that the guide was
not the equivalent of a regulation, therefore it did not need to be precisely
met. But the ASLB disagreed, and said that LES must institute a variety of
emergency measures, and must meet the regulatory guide's criteria, before a
license can be granted.</P>
<P>In doing so, the ASLB ruled that LES had not made a showing that radioactive
and chemical releases possible from the plant &quot;would not exceed certain
protective action guides.&quot;</P>
<P>Although the ASLB decision is hardly a &quot;deal-breaker;&quot; LES had
agreed to meet the guidelines--two more ASLB decisions, on much more
controversial issues including environmental racism and funding and mechanisms
for radioactive waste disposal, remain to be issued.</P>
<P>DOE MUST TAKE LES' WASTE</P>
<P>LES and its parent consortium Urenco received another bit of good news on
April 26. That day, President Clinton signed a mammoth piece of legislation
known as the &quot;Balanced Budget Downpayment Act.&quot;</P>
<P>Virtually hidden in the middle of the bill was a provision to completely
privatize the U.S. Enrichment Corporation. And stuck in this provision was one
which requires the Department of Energy to take the 300 14-ton canisters worth
of radioactive and hazardous depleted uranium the LES plant would produce every
year. LES would have to reimburse DOE for its costs. That DOE has no place to
store its own depleted uranium, much less that from LES, was apparently of
little concern to the bill's drafters.</P>
<P>Democracy seemed of little concern as well. While, the provisions mirrored a
bill (S.755) which had been passed by the Senate Energy Committee (a similar
bill had passed the House Commerce Committee), neither bill had ever been
considered on the Floor of either body. Instead, it seems as if a member of the
conference committee on the budget bill--most likely Sen. J. Bennett Johnston
(D-La.)--added the provision in conference committee, assuring that there could
be no floor debate on the controversial LES provision (41 national and regional
organizations had opposed the provision in a letter to the Senate Energy
Committee last summer).</P>
<P>URENCO &amp; SPY INVESTIGATION</P>
<P>In other news, in January Urenco acknowledged that it is conducting an
internal investigation into how blueprints for its  top-secret uranium
enrichment technology ended up in the hands of Iraq.</P>
<P>West German officials reportedly have called the breach of security &quot;the
worst case of German nuclear export violations ever.&quot;</P>
<P>Apparently, former Urenco employees had stolen the blueprints for the
company's advanced gas centrifuges, and sold them to the Iraqis.</P>
<P>It was well-known, and reported extensively in the <I>Monitor</I>, that
Urenco technology had wound up in Iraq--what has been unclear is how it got
there.</P>
<P>The Urenco investigation, as it was certainly meant to do, seems to clear
the company itself from wrongdoing, but makes equally clear that Urenco has
little handle on its staff and is nearly powerless to prevent unauthorized use
of its technology--yet another issue the U.S. Department of Energy and NRC
should examine closely before allowing this company to operate in the U.S.</P>
<P>Ironically, the ASLB threw out all of CANT's contentions related to nuclear
security for the proposed LES plant.</P>

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>American Ecology said to be in financial straits</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1>AMERICAN ECOLOGY SAID TO BE IN FINANCIAL STRAITS</H1>
<P>A memorandum written by Nebraska Compact Commissioner F. Gregory Hayden
suggests that American Ecology, parent corporation of &quot;low-level&quot;
waste dump contractor U.S. Ecology, is essentially broke and &quot;has been
suffering a combination of increasing debt and falling profits.&quot;</P>
<P>Moreover, the memo states that &quot;the profitability of American Ecology
has fallen to a level that its net income per ;year for all its operations is
less that what is receives each year from the Central Interstate Compact.&quot;</P>
<P>Given that U.S. Ecology also receives money from the Southwestern Compact
for the proposed Ward Valley &quot;low-level&quot; radioactive waste dump, it
seems that the company is relying on contracts with radioactive waste dump
states, where the dumps themselves do not exist, just to survive.</P>
<P>According to the memo, which was sent by Hayden to the other Commissioners
of the Central Interstate Compact, &quot;American Ecology and US Ecology are
expected to be responsible for assurances, fees, and as guarantors for finance
to build the Boyd County [Nebraska] facility. If the contractor is not in a
financial position to build the disposal site, the Central Interstate Compact
will be expected to provide the financing to build it. Ultimately, this means
the citizens of the five states....&quot;</P>
<P>The memo also notes that all interest charges for the company have been
charged solely to the proposed Nebraska and California dumps, despite the
company's other interests. In addition, the memo states that a full 78% of the
purchase price American Ecology paid for the Quadrex Corporation last year was
for &quot;goodwill,&quot; meaning that &quot;the purchase price was 78% above
the value of the tangible assets.&quot;</P>

<P>The Committee to Bridge the Gap has published an important new report that
concludes that &quot;unless concerted steps are taken now to help the former
Soviet Union and Eastern Europe move from reliance on inadequately designed and
operated atomic plants, the chances of another Chernobyl are unacceptably high.&quot;</P>
<P>The report, which examines nuclear power and alternative energy in Eastern
Europe and the former Soviet Union, was written by nuclear and foreign affairs
expert Bennett Ramberg.</P>
<P>The report criticizes the U.S. for failing to provide enough aid to prevent
another serious nuclear accident, but also notes that former Eastern economies
are tremendously energy inefficient, and huge gains (and reactor shutdowns)
could be achieved by implementation of standard Western energy efficiency
measures.</P>

Angeles, CA 90025; 310-478-0829 for more information.</P>
<P>The Institute for Energy and Environmental Research (IEER) has released a
new study which states that nuclear safety in the U.S. &quot;was compromised in
the quest for a Cold War propaganda advantage over the Soviet Union.&quot;</P>
<P>The book-length study, &quot;Nuclear Power Deception: U.S. Nuclear Mythology
from Electricity 'Too Cheap to Meter' to 'Inherently Safe' Reactors&quot; is a
major indictment of the commercial nuclear power industry, and a bit of a
departure for IEER, which has focused primarily on nuclear waste and weapons
production issues.</P>

<P>Dr. Jay Gould's latest book, <I>The Enemy Within: The High Cost of Living
Near Nuclear Reactors</I>, has just been published by Four Walls Eight Windows
Press.</P>
<P>In it, Gould, who wrote <I>Deadly Deceit</I>, examined National Cancer
Institute, Center for Disease Control, and state health data for 60 nuclear
sites in existence in 1981. He found statistically significant increases in
breast cancer in counties near 55 of the 60 sites<B>.</B> Other health issues
are also covered in the book.</P>
<P>Of particular use to activists are maps and charts for each of the 60 sites,

<BODY>
<H1>CHERNOBYL DIARY 1996</H1>
<H1>THIS IS HOW THE WORLD ENDS...</H1>
<P>I have seen the beginning of the end of the world. The end of the world
begins in Pripyat, Ukraine, a once-thriving city of 45,000. Now it sits
crumbling, abandoned, a mute but overwhelming testimony to man's technological
arrogance gone amok.</P>
<P>Pripyat could be the end of the beginning of the world--perhaps it will be
yet. It could offer hope that it will be the last of its kind, that our human
race could learn from the greatest of our mistakes. It seems that, from the
ruins of Pripyat, we should be able to learn our lessons. As schoolchildren we
learned from our textbooks, and at this point, Pripyat serves best as a
full-color, multimedia textbook.</P>
<P>More likely though, it is the beginning of the end. </P>
<P>Perhaps no one expected the end of the world to begin in Ukraine, but then
who expected a little-known electrical generating plant called Chernobyl to be
the harbinger of a new, terrifying nuclear age.</P>
<P>At this moment, with the failure of the G-7 conference, with the failure of
the world's environmental and safe energy organizations to convince the powers
that hold the purse strings and the keys that turn the technology off and on, it
appears absolutely inevitable that Chernobyl will happen again. Perhaps next
time it won't be in a remote area of a rather remote region in a country few in
the West know or understand. Perhaps next time it will be New York, or
Washington, or Bonn, or Paris; it really doesn't matter. Because at this point,
it appears that there will be a next time, and then a next time again...</P>
<P>Once we feared that the cataclysmic force of massive nuclear weapons
detonation would end the world in a matter of seconds. Now, it is far more
likely that a much slower, more pernicious nuclear war--that waged against the
people of the world by the globe's nuclear power industry (and it is only one
industry)---will inadvertently succeed where the weapons, in essence, failed.</P>
<P>Three Mile Island was the warning shot fired across the brow of our globe's
mutual ship. We didn't learn. Chernobyl was the first real shot fired. But the
disruption of the lives of two nations wasn't enough. The nuclear industry
stands strong.</P>
<P>So we will have another Chernobyl, and another, and eventually, we will all
live and die in Pripyat, where the end of the world began, on April 26, 1986.</P>
<P>Historians, if there are any left, will mark this day not only as the day
that marked the end of the Soviet Union and Stalinist communism, but, with
reflection, will mark this day as the beginning of the end of the world.</P>
<P>There isn't much time left to change this prognosis. That there is any time
at all is testament to the forces wielded by millions of ordinary citizens, who
have risen up and stymied an industry whose unintentional but ultimate end is
all of our end.</P>
<P>I have seen Pripyat, and the twisted, gnarled forests surrounding it. And
this is how the world ends....</P>
<P><STRONG>Washington DC, October 1995</STRONG></P>
<P>A foundation approaches NIRS and Greenpeace: would we be interested in
helping with international activities around the 10th anniversary of Chernobyl
next April?</P>
<P>You bet! A couple of weeks of tossing around ideas leads to the concept of
collecting relief supplies for Chernobyl victims, as visibly as possible, tying
in the anniversary to U.S. nuclear issues.</P>
<P>The foundation mentions an international conference in Kiev the weekend
before the anniversary. Fat chance.</P>
<P>NIRS and Greenpeace eventually each receive $15,000 to conduct
Chernobyl-related activities. We look for additional funding; but none is
forthcoming. By the end of April 1996, we've each spent more than double our
grants. </P>
<P><STRONG>Washington DC, February 1996</STRONG></P>
<P>I receive an invitation to attend the international conference in Kiev. To
be honest, I haven't yet paid much attention to the conference.</P>
<P>I look over the speaker list and the plans, including a possible visit to
Chernobyl, and decide I should go. A letter to a generous benefactor results in
just enough money to go without interfering with NIRS' already feeble budget.</P>
<P><STRONG>Washington DC, April 1996</STRONG></P>
<P>The NIRS staff is unanimous: it's marginally ok for me to go to Kiev; I
shouldn't go to Chernobyl. I search for reasons to explain why I feel I have to
go; I write a column in the <I>Nuclear Monitor</I> attempting to explain
myself. I'm not sure I convince anyone.</P>
<P>It isn't until I'm on the bus to the dead zone, not until I've spent time
with the people who have been directly affected, that I can articulate why I'm
going: it's to bear witness; to share in the tragedy with the good people of
Ukraine and Belarus; to support them in their continuous hours of need, to be
able to say, I've been there, I understand, and I can help. I hadn't counted on
the fires....</P>
<P><STRONG>Kiev, April 1996</STRONG></P>
<P>Nearly everyone attending the Lessons of Chernobyl conference stays on a
boat docked on the Dnieper River, near the old and very beautiful city of Kiev.</P>
<P>I meet people I've known only by e-mail and periodic correspondence over the
years: Joop Boer of WISE-Amsterdam, whose 10-page, handwritten letter six years
ago gave us the original ammunition to go after the proposed Louisiana Energy
Services uranium enrichment plant; Miles Goldstick of Sweden (via Canada), whose
doctoral thesis on uranium hexaflouride has proved invaluable to all fighting
nuclear fuel cycle facilities; Paxus Calta, an American who has spent the last
eight years of his life relentlessly fighting against the entrenched Eastern
European nuclear industry; and many more.</P>
<P>I'm  proud that the U.S. contingent is visible and strong: Ed Smeloff, who
led the successful fight to close the Rancho Seco reactor and who turned the
Sacramento Municipal Utility District from one of the most backward to
unquestionably the most progressive utility in the world in less than 10 years;
Bennett Ramberg of the Committee to Bridge the Gap, who has just completed a
major paper on the failure of Eastern Europe to learn the basic lessons of
Chernobyl; David Ellison, Daryl Davis and Michael McMurray of Cleveland,
representing the U.S. Green Party and grassroots anti-nuclear activists
everywhere; Amory Lovins, Harvey Wasserman, Gene Stilp of Three Mile Island
Alert, whose disarming style not only made the Eastern Europeans understand that
WE understand, but who played perhaps the most invaluable role of all: a clown
whose antics deliberately brought us all closer together and to a greater
understanding.</P>
<P>The conference itself suffers from the same problems that plague all
conferences: long-winded speakers, monopolization of limited time by a few, all
intensified by the difficulty of translating every word said into either English
or Russian.</P>
<P>But still, much is learned; especially about the tremendous obstacles faced
by Eastern European activists. When it comes to nuclear power, Stalin lives. I
quickly agree to smuggle letters into the U.S. written by a young Eastern
activist, who is afraid if mailed from his own country, they will never arrive.</P>
<P>I learn from Marianna about the fight against nuclear power in Bulgaria;
from Patricia about going up against international banks financing new nuclear
development schemes along Austria's border; from the Ukrainians about our own
Duke Engineering seeking to profit by building new waste storage facilities at
the world's largest nuclear complex.</P>
<P>From the Belarussians come the saddest stories of all: a government with no
money, saddled with huge Chernobyl-related debts, but still repressing
activists.</P>
<P>For me, in the space of just a few days, the understanding of the
international dimensions of our struggle increases a thousand-fold. Our enemies
are common: they are, in fact, the same companies--General Electric,
Westinghouse, Duke, and other recognizable names.</P>
<P>But where in the U.S. these companies sometimes play by the rules, and skirt
them only when no one is looking, in Eastern Europe they flout the rules. In
Eastern Europe, these companies show no pretense about democracy or doing what
is best.  Their greed is eclipsed only by ubiquitous presence. Everywhere,
activists ask for our help, seek access to the documents we take for granted,
grab for our ideas.</P>
<P>We all stay up late into the night, exchanging ideas, e-mail addresses,
promises. I think a lot of them will be fulfilled.</P>
<P><STRONG>Kiev, April 22, 1996</STRONG></P>
<P>On Monday, after two days of conference, action begins to transcend
discussion.</P>
<P>With military precision, more than 70 Greenpeace Ukraine activists stage a
sit-in at the offices of Ukraine's President, demanding an immediate shutdown of
the two operating units at Chernobyl.</P>
<P>Dressed in white and black, they bring a coffin and a letter accepted by a
representative from the President's office.  A debate ensues; disheartingly, the
debate is translated for me: the President's emissary is telling Greenpeace that
they are not experts, that Chernobyl is safe.</P>
<P>This is the same government that seeks billions of dollars of aid to close
Chernobyl, that says the death toll may be 125,000, that the health and clean-up
costs run 5% or more of their annual budget and cannot even come close to
addressing the real needs. And everyone in Ukraine acknowledges that the
situation in Belarus is worse, far worse. Earlier, at a reception in Washington,
the consul to the Belarus embassy says it would take 32 full annual budgets of
his country just to meet  the already-identified costs of Chernobyl.</P>
<P>On an unseen cue, the Greenpeace activists surround the President's emissary
with white crosses, each bearing the name of a  permanently-evacuated village.
There are more than 70 of them. Soon, he is surrounded  by crosses and TV
cameraman, and he looks as desperate and silly as the policies he is espousing.</P>
<P><I>If you smile at me I will understand, because that is something
everybody everywhere does in the same language. I can see by your coat my friend
you're from the other side, there's just one thing I have to know, can you tell
me please who won?</I></P>
<P><STRONG>The Dead Zone, April 23, 1996</STRONG></P>
<P>Radiation levels in Kiev are at background, comparable to Washington. But
the nation of Ukraine is clearly ill: a broken treatment plant somewhere
upstream has spewed raw sewage down the Dnieper River past our boat for two days
now. The fisherman on the opposite bank are, unfortunately, undeterred. The
weather is warm, but the sky never gets quite blue, a seemingly permanent haze
permeates the air, Ukraine is a nightmare of pollution; the people recognize
this and fight and fight and fight, but there is only so much power and even
less money....</P>
<P>On the roadside, chickens, roosters and goats straddle by ancient villages;
some houses sport TV antennas, others look like they haven't changed in 200
years.</P>
<P>On our bus as we travel into the Dead Zone, we check our radiation monitors;
background levels rise very slowly. By the time we reach the first checkpoint
into the Dead Zone, they are less than twice Kiev background levels.</P>
<P>But while the Berlin Wall came down in 1989, the Chernobyl Wall still
exists: a barbed wire fence meant not to keep people in, but to keep them
out....</P>
<P>Past the first checkpoint, we drive further, past endless fields of dry
grass and forest; life is gone here: no people, no animals, no birds. We pass by
a small area covered with rusting school buses and helicopters--only one of 800
radioactive waste dumps in the dead zone--no one knows where they all are, some
were bulldozed before their location could be identified.</P>
<P>Once this was among the most productive farmland of all Europe, now it is
useless, even deadly.</P>
<P>The official Dead Zone is an approximate circle with a radius of about 30
kilometers (18 miles). The real Dead Zone, which stretches far into Belarus, is
the size of Switzerland.</P>
<P>We stop in the town of Chernobyl, about 12 miles from the reactor complex
and the official headquarters of the Dead Zone. We receive a briefing from the
person in charge of the contaminated area. He tells us that 11,000 people work
in the Dead Zone, half at a time. They work 15 days, then have 15 days off. Most
seem to live in Chernobyl, given the rather bustling nature of the place. </P>
<P>He also mentions that we might have heard there is a fire there today (we
haven't). He assures us it is under control (as we learn later, it isn't).</P>
<P>We climb back on our buses and proceed to the &quot;Contamination Control
Center.&quot; We had originally been told that we were not welcome, and that we
would not be allowed to get near the reactor, nor do anything but tour a few
contaminated villages by bus. Those orders now appear to have been
countermanded, although we can't be sure.</P>
<P>At the control center, we strip, and don new clothes, boots, masks, and head
protection. Our clothes are placed in lockers awaiting our return.</P>
<P>The Center was built in 1988 for clean-up workers. Now it is used mostly for
the occasional tourists, such as ourselves, given access to the Zone. We're told
the clothes they give us will be disposed of as radioactive waste when we
return. But I learn the boots are cleaned and re-used; I suspect the clothes are
too....</P>
<P>Radiation counts at the Center range from double to triple background levels
at Kiev--still fairly low.</P>
<P>Properly outfitted, we climb on new buses--the ones that brought us here
aren't allowed to go any further, the ones that take us now aren't allowed to
leave the Zone.</P>
<P>A few minutes driving time later, we see a series of large buildings on the
horizon, in the middle of a large flat field. We argue whether this is indeed
Chernobyl or yet another abandoned industrial plant. It is Chernobyl.</P>
<P>We still don't know how close they will take us to the reactor, but we soon
find out: within 500 yards of the sarcophagus the bus suddenly stops and our
guide says you may get out and take pictures, but please stay on the concrete,
don't walk on the dirt.</P>
<P>The sarcophagus looms above us, huge, but somehow less impressive than the
photos. In real life, Chernobyl is a series of banal industrial buildings, whose
importance in changing the world is belied by its commonplace appearance.</P>
<P>Most of our radiation monitors go off-scale when we dismount from the bus. I
have one monitor which allows me to adjust to higher levels. The count is nearly
2,000 counts per minute; according to my monitor this is about 2 millirems/hour.
To those of us wrapped up in protective gear, listening to our radiation
monitors click incessantly, this seems terrifyingly high---in just two days one
would receive the U.S. annual maximum permissible dose.</P>
<P>Then we realize the truth of the matter: a friend from Kiev points out that
this is the exact level citizens of that 3-million population capital city
received every day for about two weeks after the accident---and no one ever told
them, until well afterwards, that there was a problem.</P>
<P>Kiev is 80 miles south of Chernobyl and was spared the worst of the
reactor's spewing of radiation and heavy metals. To the North and West,
radiation levels were far higher for the May Day parades of 1986. But who knew?</P>
<P>If anyone doubts that Chernobyl brought down the Soviet system, talk to a
few people who were parents of young children in 1986. Their rage, upon learning
the true dimensions of Chernobyl, was unstoppable. The world's leaders should
take note that no system could survive the wrath of mothers who have been lied
to when their children were so endangered. In this event, the White House itself
would fall....</P>
<P><STRONG>Pripyat, April 23, 1996</STRONG></P>
<P>Before it became a symbol of the nuclear age, Pripyat was a Stalinist
nightmare. Row after row of identical apartment buildings, broken up only by
occasional, identically placed shops covered with Soviet-realist murals.</P>
<P>At the center of the city was a huge square, built not for people but for
the grandiosity of the State. An energy building, stores, all designed to
intimidate rather than welcome the people who lived and worked less than two
miles from the Chernobyl reactors. </P>
<P>Behind the grand square lies the one concession to real people. At the end
of a path lined by dilapidated kiosks featuring silkscreens of Lenin urging
Socialism to move ever forward lies a permanently-abandoned amusement park.</P>
<P>I walk through Pripyat, in my protective clothing and mask. The radiation
readings range from 20-40 times above background--far too high for anyone to
live there. I peek in one window which shows overturned furniture, a couple of
mattresses stacked against a wall, unidentifiable things. Perhaps this is where
the relatively well-paid residents of Pripyat outfitted their apartments?</P>
<P>I walk back across the square, across crumbling steps, dry grass growing
everywhere through the concrete--a single yellow flower rises through the grass
in this still city of death.</P>
<P>In the distance, I can see huge plumes of brown smoke heading in our
direction.</P>
<P>I walk toward the amusement park, feeling like an alien from a science
fiction movie: two radiation detectors in hand counting furiously, crossing an
abandoned city. </P>
<P>The smoke, driven by fires ten miles away, comes closer.</P>
<P>As the smoke reaches us, the smell of burning wood permeating our protective
masks, we begin to make our way back to the relative safety of our buses.</P>
<P>But we pause for a moment, Gene Stilp and I, and look around. For this truly
is how the world ends, not with a cataclysmic bang, but with a radioactive
whimper.</P>
<P>Not from a sudden blast from an enemy power, but from the steady
contamination of a friendly industrial infrastructure.</P>
<P>Pripyat is the end of the world, it is the apocalypse.</P>
<P>The question is whether Pripyat will be merely the end of the Soviet Union
and an economic and health burden on Ukraine, Belarus, and even Russia for
generations to come, or whether it must be repeated, again and again, until our
Earth's powers recognize that there is no escape from a Chernobyl.</P>
<P>Chernobyl remains a powerful image, because it <I>is</I> a powerful image.
And the radiation from Chernobyl still kills. The fires in the Dead Zone
continue to spread lethal radiation across the countryside. The costs of
Chernobyl continue to outstrip the budgets of all relevant governments.</P>
<P>So this is how the world ends...</P>
<P>A few people in radiation suits come to monitor and witness. Pripyat could
be New York City. Or Washington DC, or Chicago or Philadelphia.</P>
<P>And indeed, those cities will become Pripyat, unless we close nuclear
reactors now.</P>
<P>That's a talent we'd better become a lot better at. We're pretty good at
blocking the nuclear power industry's initiatives; we're not nearly as skilled
at advancing our own agenda.</P>
<P>But the quiet radioactive breeze of Pripyat tells me we'd better learn
quickly.</P>
<P>I have to believe that Pripyat is only one possible future; there are
others. </P>
<P><STRONG>Washington DC, April 26, 1996</STRONG></P>
<P>The Safe Energy Communication Council sponsors a morning Chernobyl
commemoration in Lafayette Park in front of the White House. Still suffering
from jet lag and emotional disruption, I say a few words, trying to speak from
the heart and tell the audience what I saw and what it means.</P>
<P>Afterwards, Valery Kurdyukov, the young Counsel for the Belarus embassy
walks up, shakes my hand, thanks me for my work, and praises my courage for
going to Chernobyl.  I'm dumbfounded. The courage isn't mine, I reply,  I could
leave anytime. The people of Ukraine and Belarus cannot.</P>
<P>They are the ones already living at the end of the world. It is up to the
rest of us to determine whether we have the courage to ensure that Chernobyl is
the last gasp of a dying nuclear age, or whether Chernobyl is the future of a
damaged, dying Earth.</P>

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Chernobyl consequences</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1>THE CONSEQUENCES OF CHERNOBYL</H1>
<P>Ask ten scientists to describe the consequences of Chernobyl, and you'll
likely get twelve different opinions.</P>
<P>That there is little agreement over Chernobyl's consequences so far isn't
terribly surprising, given the paucity of pre-accident data to work with and the
controversial nature of the issue itself. What is more stunning are the vast
differences in estimates of health effects.</P>
<P>The U.N.'s World Health Organization (WHO) estimates, for example, that so
far only about 50 people have died as a direct result of Chernobyl, and a few
hundred cases of cancer--mostly thyroid--likely will lead to additional deaths.</P>
<P>But the WHO's estimates are so much lower than every other estimate that it
is difficult to take them seriously. It appears that the WHO has only accepted
deaths which can provably be laid to Chernobyl radiation.</P>
<P>But radiation doesn't carry a silver bullet: when someone dies of cancer or,
as they call it in Ukraine, Chernobyl AIDS--a weakness and general suppression
of the immune system--there is no banner which rises up and says &quot;Chernobyl
killed me.&quot;</P>
<P>On the high end, a Ukrainian victims group claims 150,000 already dead, the
Ukrainian Ministry of Public Health in April 1995 said 125,000 already dead.
Both estimates seem high, and indeed, include deaths of elderly persons who
might reasonably have been expected to die over the past ten years in any event.
[However, contrary to nuclear industry propaganda, these numbers do not include
everyone who died in Ukraine from 1986-95 from any cause, including car
accidents. If so, Ukraine would probably have the lowest death rate in the
industrialized world. Instead, it has one of the highest. Indeed, Belarus and
Ukraine may be the only two nations on the planet whose death rate exceeds the
birth rate].</P>
<P>Other estimates range from several thousand, mostly &quot;liquidators&quot;
who have died, to an estimate by Greenpeace Ukraine of 32,000 now dead.
Greenpeace derived their figure by examining death rates from illnesses before
and after the accident. Their research was solid enough that Yuri Shcherbak, the
Ukraine Ambassador to the United States, accepts that estimate in the April 1996
issue of Scientific American.</P>
<P>The economic cost to Belarus, Ukraine and Russia has been even greater--more
on that in a moment. But often overlooked as a Chernobyl consequence is the
effect diversion of huge portions of these countries' budgets has had on public
health and mortality. Ukraine, for example, has been spending 5-7% of its annual
budget on Chernobyl-related activities; Belarus has been spending 20% and more.
Had that funding been available instead for public health and welfare
improvements, it is unquestionable that both countries would be much better off,
and very likely that the mortality rates would be far lower. </P>
<P>Economically, the consequences have been staggering. Even conservative
estimates, counting direct costs, interdicted land, health costs, and related
losses, are at $300 Billion and more.</P>
<P>First, consider that Chernobyl was in a very remote area, 80 miles from Kiev
to the south and 80 miles from Gomel to the north. Then consider that Indian
Point is only 35 miles from Manhattan; Limerick a similar distance from
Philadelphia; Zion even closer to Chicago; Wolf Creek and Callaway in the center
of our nation's agricultural heartland. According to the 1982 Sandia National
Laboratories CRAC-II report (Calculation of Reactor Accident Consequences), we
could expect as much as $300 billion from a meltdown at Indian Point, and far
less at most other locations. Fat chance. A meltdown at nearly any U.S. reactor,
and at most European ones as well, clearly would reach the Trillion-Dollar range</P>
<P>Much has been written this tenth anniversary about the &quot;psychic damage&quot;
attributed to Chernobyl. Many articles have implied that this is the major,
perhaps only real damage from the accident.</P>
<P>Make no mistake, the psychic damage is real. People in Ukraine, Belarus and
Russia <I>are</I> scared. They are afraid to have children, afraid of dying
young, afraid of another Chernobyl. Western scientists, especially those
affiliated with the nuclear industry, dismiss this as &quot;radiophobia.&quot;
In fact, it is an entirely rational response to the enormous consequences that
do exist and to a government that lied unforgivably to them once and may do so
again.</P>
<P>The people of Eastern Europe do not like living in polluted environments any
more than we do. But to call them &quot;phobic&quot; because they react humanly
to those environments is the ultimate insult. The stakes are very real and high
and, as usual, the people know best. </P>

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>C+10 in the USA</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1>CHERNOBYL+10 IN THE USA</H1>
<P>In more than 30 states, environmental activists are working to make a real
difference in the lives of the children of Chernobyl.</P>
<P>In Arcata, California; Detroit, Michigan; South Bend, Indiana; Washington,
DC and many more, activists are collecting goods to send to Chernobyl victims.</P>
<P>In addition, scores of rallies, demonstrations, lectures, and commemoration
ceremonies were held across the country from April 25-27, 1996.</P>
<P>The media may not have picked up on these activities where you are--they
sure didn't do much in the Washington area--but thousands of people
participated, learned, and became involved.</P>
<P>It's not too late to get involved. NIRS, Greenpeace and the Greens/Green
Party USA have extended relief collection efforts until May 31. That doesn't
mean, if you already have been collecting goods, that you must collect through
that date. Rather, it means that NIRS and Children of Chernobyl will be
accepting relief supplies until late June, so you can continue collecting
through May.</P>
<P>In fact, because of a great U.S. response to needed goods, Children of
Chernobyl cannot even accept any goods at its warehouse until after May
15--since the warehouse is currently full. On May 15, a plane loaded with needed
supplies will fly to Kiev; it is our hope we'll fill another plane by late June.</P>
<P>If you haven't been involved in collecting Chernobyl relief supplies, it's
not too late to help.</P>
<P>Financial contributions are desperately needed as well. There are three
categories of such contributions.</P>
<OL>
<LI> For Chernobyl relief. These contributions will be pooled and 95% will be
used to purchase additional goods, at wholesale or below, for Chernobyl victims.
5% goes to cover NIRS' accounting and other overhead costs to collect this
money. We've already received $1,000 from Kansas Physicians for Social
Responsibility and other checks from numerous concerned individuals. But the
best we can do is make a small dent in the problem; Billions are needed to fully
address the problems caused by Chernobyl.
</LI>
<LI> You can help Eastern European anti-nuclear groups. Even small
contributions make a big difference in these poor, still sometimes totalitarian
states. You may choose which country's groups you would like to support, or NIRS
will bundle all other contributions to a particularly dedicated organization in
Bulgaria fighting two nuclear plants.
</LI>
<LI> You can give a donation to NIRS to help us pay for the Chernobyl+10
campaign. NIRS received $15,000 to mount this national effort; we've spent at
least $40,000. As usual, we tried to do what was needed, and not just what was
funded.
</LI>
</OL>
<P>Contributions to any of the above are fully tax-deductible. Be sure to mark
on your check to which effort you want your money to go.</P>
<P>As always, we thank you for your support , your confidence in our efforts
and your concern.</P>

<H2>THE EAGLE ALLIANCE: A NEW PRO-NUCLEAR GROUP ARRIVES ON THE SCENE--AND THIS
ONE IS CONNECTED AND MILITANT</H2> 
<H2>BUT QUESTIONS ARE RAISED ABOUT THE INVOLVEMENT OF DOE LABS AND
CONTRACTORS....</H2> 
<P>
It is not unusual, especially in an election year, to see new special-interest
groups form in Washington DC and across the country.
</P>
<P>
But it is somewhat unusual to see a new, avidly pro-nuclear alliance form,
particularly one with the imprimatur of the usually staid professional
organization, American Nuclear Society.
</P>
<P>
And it is still rarer to find one that has among its explicit goals influence
over upcoming elections and party platforms, but which also numbers top
officials from five major Department of Energy laboratories among its founding
members.
</P>
<P>
Welcome to the Eagle Alliance--the nuclear industry's latest shot at promoting a
nuclear power revival.
</P>
<P>
Not that the Eagle Alliance would settle for just a few new nuclear plants.
Sure, they want some new reactors, but this group wants it all: massive food
irradiation; a <I>nuclear </I>cure for cancer (apparently they're not
interested in a cure if it's non-nuclear); establishment of a scientific basis
that proves low doses of radiation aren't harmful (forget the scientific method,
which requires that experiments precede conclusions); and making environmental
and anti-nuclear groups &quot;responsible&quot; for their actions--whatever that
might mean.
</P>
<P>
The Eagle Alliance seemed to have come out of nowhere (a copy of its brochure
arrived on NIRS' fax machine one night), but obviously has been some time in the
making.
</P>
<P>
Its founding members are dominated, unsurprisingly, by executives from nuclear
utilities and nuclear industry suppliers. But they also include the President of
the National Treasury Employees Union, high-ranking officials in the American
Medical Association and American Cancer Society, and, of all people, the
executive director of the Institute of Packaging Professionals. Most
controversially, the Alliance founders also include the chiefs of the major
Department of Energy nuclear laboratories at Brookhaven, Los Alamos, Argonne,
Oak Ridge, and the Department of Energy manager at Idaho Operations.
</P>
<P>
What is even more remarkable is that the Eagle Alliance apparently was
established by the relatively stodgy American Nuclear Society (ANS). Like most
professional organizations, the ANS has primarily devoted its efforts to
ensuring standards within its field, holding annual conferences for society
members, and publishing a monthly magazine (Nuclear News) which serves as a news
source and cheerleader for subscribers.
</P>
<P>
But the type of lobbying and militant pro-nuclear rhetoric espoused by the Eagle
Alliance might make even the Nuclear Energy Institute blush.
</P>
<P>
For example, the Eagle Alliance is not content to merely battle environmental
groups for public opinion. In rather threatening language, it seeks to &quot;institute
methods to make special interest and activist organizations responsible for the
results of their actions.&quot;
</P>
<P>
Similarly, when the Eagle Alliance talks about food irradiation, it wants it on
a &quot;major&quot; scale. As one of its five key goals, the Alliance says it
wants to &quot;stimulate major use of food irradiation.&quot; Its strategies
include &quot;support legislative to designate food irradiation as a process,
rather than an additive...develop strong media coverage showing the health
benefits of food irradiation...establish strong support for at least one major
retailer selling irradiated food.&quot;
</P>
<P>
Eschewing the scientific process (a rather odd position for an allegedly
scientific society). another goal is to &quot;achieve risk-based regulations for
nuclear industry.&quot; The strategies are &quot;establish a strong scientific
basis for negligible health effects of low-level radiation...encourage a
political mandate for risk-based approach at NRC, EPA, and FDA.&quot;
</P>
<P>
Nuclear medicine? If you believe the Alliance, that's all there is. They're not
searching for a cure for cancer, they're searching for &quot;a nuclear cure for
cancer.&quot;
</P>
<P>
Don't forget politics. The Alliance's number one goal is to &quot;achieve
pro-nuclear planks in major political parties for 1996 elections.&quot;
Strategies include &quot;make persuasive contact, via senior nuclear personnel,
to every incumbent and candidate for 1996 congressional and gubernatorial
offices in the nation...convene at least one significant session with every
president candidate in the 1996 election with a top-level cross-section of the
Alliance.&quot;
</P>
<P>
Pretty soon, we expect the Eagle Alliance to be leading demonstrations in the
streets, conducting sit-ins in front of NIRS' offices, and conducting relief
efforts for those who have lost money on nuclear utility stocks. That may not be
so far-fetched: the Alliance says it wants to &quot;orchestrate a 'Nuclear
Freeze' day with wide public coverage to dramatize everyday services provided by
nuclear technology.&quot;
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, however, their presence among the founding members of the Eagle
Alliance raises serious conflict-of interest charges for the directors of the
DOE-sponsored national laboratories, as well as the members from medical
societies--who, after all, aren't charged with promoting nuclear cures for
disease (at least by the public) but who are entrusted with curing disease,
period.
</P>
<P>
The founding of the Eagle Alliance brings the hypocrisy of the nuclear
establishment front and center. It smacks of nothing more than a last-ditch
effort by a flailing industry which must know the game is already over even as
its members run out onto the field.
</P>
<P><STRONG>
WHAT YOU CAN DO
</STRONG></P>
<P>
Write Department of Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary (DOE, Washington, DC 20585),
and include a copy of your letter to your senators, representatives and
President Clinton. Demand the immediate dismissal of the five officials from of
the DOE national labs on conflict of interest grounds, and an assurance that
future directors will not be allowed to mix their personal politics and
vendettas with their business.

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Chernboyl Diary, 1996</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1>CHERNOBYL DIARY 1996</H1>
<H1>THIS IS HOW THE WORLD ENDS...</H1>
<P>I have seen the beginning of the end of the world. The end of the world
begins in Pripyat, Ukraine, a once-thriving city of 45,000. Now it sits
crumbling, abandoned, a mute but overwhelming testimony to man's technological
arrogance gone amok.</P>
<P>Pripyat could be the end of the beginning of the world--perhaps it will be
yet. It could offer hope that it will be the last of its kind, that our human
race could learn from the greatest of our mistakes. It seems that, from the
ruins of Pripyat, we should be able to learn our lessons. As schoolchildren we
learned from our textbooks, and at this point, Pripyat serves best as a
full-color, multimedia textbook.</P>
<P>More likely though, it is the beginning of the end. </P>
<P>Perhaps no one expected the end of the world to begin in Ukraine, but then
who expected a little-known electrical generating plant called Chernobyl to be
the harbinger of a new, terrifying nuclear age.</P>
<P>At this moment, with the failure of the G-7 conference, with the failure of
the world's environmental and safe energy organizations to convince the powers
that hold the purse strings and the keys that turn the technology off and on, it
appears absolutely inevitable that Chernobyl will happen again. Perhaps next
time it won't be in a remote area of a rather remote region in a country few in
the West know or understand. Perhaps next time it will be New York, or
Washington, or Bonn, or Paris; it really doesn't matter. Because at this point,
it appears that there will be a next time, and then a next time again...</P>
<P>Once we feared that the cataclysmic force of massive nuclear weapons
detonation would end the world in a matter of seconds. Now, it is far more
likely that a much slower, more pernicious nuclear war--that waged against the
people of the world by the globe's nuclear power industry (and it is only one
industry)---will inadvertently succeed where the weapons, in essence, failed.</P>
<P>Three Mile Island was the warning shot fired across the brow of our globe's
mutual ship. We didn't learn. Chernobyl was the first real shot fired. But the
disruption of the lives of two nations wasn't enough. The nuclear industry
stands strong.</P>
<P>So we will have another Chernobyl, and another, and eventually, we will all
live and die in Pripyat, where the end of the world began, on April 26, 1986.</P>
<P>Historians, if there are any left, will mark this day not only as the day
that marked the end of the Soviet Union and Stalinist communism, but, with
reflection, will mark this day as the beginning of the end of the world.</P>
<P>There isn't much time left to change this prognosis. That there is any time
at all is testament to the forces wielded by millions of ordinary citizens, who
have risen up and stymied an industry whose unintentional but ultimate end is
all of our end.</P>
<P>I have seen Pripyat, and the twisted, gnarled forests surrounding it. And
this is how the world ends....</P>
<P><STRONG>Washington DC, October 1995</STRONG></P>
<P>A foundation approaches NIRS and Greenpeace: would we be interested in
helping with international activities around the 10th anniversary of Chernobyl
next April?</P>
<P>You bet! A couple of weeks of tossing around ideas leads to the concept of
collecting relief supplies for Chernobyl victims, as visibly as possible, tying
in the anniversary to U.S. nuclear issues.</P>
<P>The foundation mentions an international conference in Kiev the weekend
before the anniversary. Fat chance.</P>
<P>NIRS and Greenpeace eventually each receive $15,000 to conduct
Chernobyl-related activities. We look for additional funding; but none is
forthcoming. By the end of April 1996, we've each spent more than double our
grants. </P>
<P><STRONG>Washington DC, February 1996</STRONG></P>
<P>I receive an invitation to attend the international conference in Kiev. To
be honest, I haven't yet paid much attention to the conference.</P>
<P>I look over the speaker list and the plans, including a possible visit to
Chernobyl, and decide I should go. A letter to a generous benefactor results in
just enough money to go without interfering with NIRS' already feeble budget.</P>
<P><STRONG>Washington DC, April 1996</STRONG></P>
<P>The NIRS staff is unanimous: it's marginally ok for me to go to Kiev; I
shouldn't go to Chernobyl. I search for reasons to explain why I feel I have to
go; I write a column in the <I>Nuclear Monitor</I> attempting to explain
myself. I'm not sure I convince anyone.</P>
<P>It isn't until I'm on the bus to the dead zone, not until I've spent time
with the people who have been directly affected, that I can articulate why I'm
going: it's to bear witness; to share in the tragedy with the good people of
Ukraine and Belarus; to support them in their continuous hours of need, to be
able to say, I've been there, I understand, and I can help. I hadn't counted on
the fires....</P>
<P><STRONG>Kiev, April 1996</STRONG></P>
<P>Nearly everyone attending the Lessons of Chernobyl conference stays on a
boat docked on the Dnieper River, near the old and very beautiful city of Kiev.</P>
<P>I meet people I've known only by e-mail and periodic correspondence over the
years: Joop Boer of WISE-Amsterdam, whose 10-page, handwritten letter six years
ago gave us the original ammunition to go after the proposed Louisiana Energy
Services uranium enrichment plant; Miles Goldstick of Sweden (via Canada), whose
doctoral thesis on uranium hexaflouride has proved invaluable to all fighting
nuclear fuel cycle facilities; Paxus Calta, an American who has spent the last
eight years of his life relentlessly fighting against the entrenched Eastern
European nuclear industry; and many more.</P>
<P>I'm  proud that the U.S. contingent is visible and strong: Ed Smeloff, who
led the successful fight to close the Rancho Seco reactor and who turned the
Sacramento Municipal Utility District from one of the most backward to
unquestionably the most progressive utility in the world in less than 10 years;
Bennett Ramberg of the Committee to Bridge the Gap, who has just completed a
major paper on the failure of Eastern Europe to learn the basic lessons of
Chernobyl; David Ellison, Daryl Davis and Michael McMurray of Cleveland,
representing the U.S. Green Party and grassroots anti-nuclear activists
everywhere; Amory Lovins, Harvey Wasserman, Gene Stilp of Three Mile Island
Alert, whose disarming style not only made the Eastern Europeans understand that
WE understand, but who played perhaps the most invaluable role of all: a clown
whose antics deliberately brought us all closer together and to a greater
understanding.</P>
<P>The conference itself suffers from the same problems that plague all
conferences: long-winded speakers, monopolization of limited time by a few, all
intensified by the difficulty of translating every word said into either English
or Russian.</P>
<P>But still, much is learned; especially about the tremendous obstacles faced
by Eastern European activists. When it comes to nuclear power, Stalin lives. I
quickly agree to smuggle letters into the U.S. written by a young Eastern
activist, who is afraid if mailed from his own country, they will never arrive.</P>
<P>I learn from Marianna about the fight against nuclear power in Bulgaria;
from Patricia about going up against international banks financing new nuclear
development schemes along Austria's border; from the Ukrainians about our own
Duke Engineering seeking to profit by building new waste storage facilities at
the world's largest nuclear complex.</P>
<P>From the Belarussians come the saddest stories of all: a government with no
money, saddled with huge Chernobyl-related debts, but still repressing
activists.</P>
<P>For me, in the space of just a few days, the understanding of the
international dimensions of our struggle increases a thousand-fold. Our enemies
are common: they are, in fact, the same companies--General Electric,
Westinghouse, Duke, and other recognizable names.</P>
<P>But where in the U.S. these companies sometimes play by the rules, and skirt
them only when no one is looking, in Eastern Europe they flout the rules. In
Eastern Europe, these companies show no pretense about democracy or doing what
is best.  Their greed is eclipsed only by ubiquitous presence. Everywhere,
activists ask for our help, seek access to the documents we take for granted,
grab for our ideas.</P>
<P>We all stay up late into the night, exchanging ideas, e-mail addresses,
promises. I think a lot of them will be fulfilled.</P>
<P><STRONG>Kiev, April 22, 1996</STRONG></P>
<P>On Monday, after two days of conference, action begins to transcend
discussion.</P>
<P>With military precision, more than 70 Greenpeace Ukraine activists stage a
sit-in at the offices of Ukraine's President, demanding an immediate shutdown of
the two operating units at Chernobyl.</P>
<P>Dressed in white and black, they bring a coffin and a letter accepted by a
representative from the President's office.  A debate ensues; disheartingly, the
debate is translated for me: the President's emissary is telling Greenpeace that
they are not experts, that Chernobyl is safe.</P>
<P>This is the same government that seeks billions of dollars of aid to close
Chernobyl, that says the death toll may be 125,000, that the health and clean-up
costs run 5% or more of their annual budget and cannot even come close to
addressing the real needs. And everyone in Ukraine acknowledges that the
situation in Belarus is worse, far worse. Earlier, at a reception in Washington,
the consul to the Belarus embassy says it would take 32 full annual budgets of
his country just to meet  the already-identified costs of Chernobyl.</P>
<P>On an unseen cue, the Greenpeace activists surround the President's emissary
with white crosses, each bearing the name of a  permanently-evacuated village.
There are more than 70 of them. Soon, he is surrounded  by crosses and TV
cameraman, and he looks as desperate and silly as the policies he is espousing.</P>
<P><I>If you smile at me I will understand, because that is something
everybody everywhere does in the same language. I can see by your coat my friend
you're from the other side, there's just one thing I have to know, can you tell
me please who won?</I></P>
<P><STRONG>The Dead Zone, April 23, 1996</STRONG></P>
<P>Radiation levels in Kiev are at background, comparable to Washington. But
the nation of Ukraine is clearly ill: a broken treatment plant somewhere
upstream has spewed raw sewage down the Dnieper River past our boat for two days
now. The fisherman on the opposite bank are, unfortunately, undeterred. The
weather is warm, but the sky never gets quite blue, a seemingly permanent haze
permeates the air, Ukraine is a nightmare of pollution; the people recognize
this and fight and fight and fight, but there is only so much power and even
less money....</P>
<P>On the roadside, chickens, roosters and goats straddle by ancient villages;
some houses sport TV antennas, others look like they haven't changed in 200
years.</P>
<P>On our bus as we travel into the Dead Zone, we check our radiation monitors;
background levels rise very slowly. By the time we reach the first checkpoint
into the Dead Zone, they are less than twice Kiev background levels.</P>
<P>But while the Berlin Wall came down in 1989, the Chernobyl Wall still
exists: a barbed wire fence meant not to keep people in, but to keep them
out....</P>
<P>Past the first checkpoint, we drive further, past endless fields of dry
grass and forest; life is gone here: no people, no animals, no birds. We pass by
a small area covered with rusting school buses and helicopters--only one of 800
radioactive waste dumps in the dead zone--no one knows where they all are, some
were bulldozed before their location could be identified.</P>
<P>Once this was among the most productive farmland of all Europe, now it is
useless, even deadly.</P>
<P>The official Dead Zone is an approximate circle with a radius of about 30
kilometers (18 miles). The real Dead Zone, which stretches far into Belarus, is
the size of Switzerland.</P>
<P>We stop in the town of Chernobyl, about 12 miles from the reactor complex
and the official headquarters of the Dead Zone. We receive a briefing from the
person in charge of the contaminated area. He tells us that 11,000 people work
in the Dead Zone, half at a time. They work 15 days, then have 15 days off. Most
seem to live in Chernobyl, given the rather bustling nature of the place. </P>
<P>He also mentions that we might have heard there is a fire there today (we
haven't). He assures us it is under control (as we learn later, it isn't).</P>
<P>We climb back on our buses and proceed to the &quot;Contamination Control
Center.&quot; We had originally been told that we were not welcome, and that we
would not be allowed to get near the reactor, nor do anything but tour a few
contaminated villages by bus. Those orders now appear to have been
countermanded, although we can't be sure.</P>
<P>At the control center, we strip, and don new clothes, boots, masks, and head
protection. Our clothes are placed in lockers awaiting our return.</P>
<P>The Center was built in 1988 for clean-up workers. Now it is used mostly for
the occasional tourists, such as ourselves, given access to the Zone. We're told
the clothes they give us will be disposed of as radioactive waste when we
return. But I learn the boots are cleaned and re-used; I suspect the clothes are
too....</P>
<P>Radiation counts at the Center range from double to triple background levels
at Kiev--still fairly low.</P>
<P>Properly outfitted, we climb on new buses--the ones that brought us here
aren't allowed to go any further, the ones that take us now aren't allowed to
leave the Zone.</P>
<P>A few minutes driving time later, we see a series of large buildings on the
horizon, in the middle of a large flat field. We argue whether this is indeed
Chernobyl or yet another abandoned industrial plant. It is Chernobyl.</P>
<P>We still don't know how close they will take us to the reactor, but we soon
find out: within 500 yards of the sarcophagus the bus suddenly stops and our
guide says you may get out and take pictures, but please stay on the concrete,
don't walk on the dirt.</P>
<P>The sarcophagus looms above us, huge, but somehow less impressive than the
photos. In real life, Chernobyl is a series of banal industrial buildings, whose
importance in changing the world is belied by its commonplace appearance.</P>
<P>Most of our radiation monitors go off-scale when we dismount from the bus. I
have one monitor which allows me to adjust to higher levels. The count is nearly
2,000 counts per minute; according to my monitor this is about 2 millirems/hour.
To those of us wrapped up in protective gear, listening to our radiation
monitors click incessantly, this seems terrifyingly high---in just two days one
would receive the U.S. annual maximum permissible dose.</P>
<P>Then we realize the truth of the matter: a friend from Kiev points out that
this is the exact level citizens of that 3-million population capital city
received every day for about two weeks after the accident---and no one ever told
them, until well afterwards, that there was a problem.</P>
<P>Kiev is 80 miles south of Chernobyl and was spared the worst of the
reactor's spewing of radiation and heavy metals. To the North and West,
radiation levels were far higher for the May Day parades of 1986. But who knew?</P>
<P>If anyone doubts that Chernobyl brought down the Soviet system, talk to a
few people who were parents of young children in 1986. Their rage, upon learning
the true dimensions of Chernobyl, was unstoppable. The world's leaders should
take note that no system could survive the wrath of mothers who have been lied
to when their children were so endangered. In this event, the White House itself
would fall....</P>
<P><STRONG>Pripyat, April 23, 1996</STRONG></P>
<P>Before it became a symbol of the nuclear age, Pripyat was a Stalinist
nightmare. Row after row of identical apartment buildings, broken up only by
occasional, identically placed shops covered with Soviet-realist murals.</P>
<P>At the center of the city was a huge square, built not for people but for
the grandiosity of the State. An energy building, stores, all designed to
intimidate rather than welcome the people who lived and worked less than two
miles from the Chernobyl reactors. </P>
<P>Behind the grand square lies the one concession to real people. At the end
of a path lined by dilapidated kiosks featuring silkscreens of Lenin urging
Socialism to move ever forward lies a permanently-abandoned amusement park.</P>
<P>I walk through Pripyat, in my protective clothing and mask. The radiation
readings range from 20-40 times above background--far too high for anyone to
live there. I peek in one window which shows overturned furniture, a couple of
mattresses stacked against a wall, unidentifiable things. Perhaps this is where
the relatively well-paid residents of Pripyat outfitted their apartments?</P>
<P>I walk back across the square, across crumbling steps, dry grass growing
everywhere through the concrete--a single yellow flower rises through the grass
in this still city of death.</P>
<P>In the distance, I can see huge plumes of brown smoke heading in our
direction.</P>
<P>I walk toward the amusement park, feeling like an alien from a science
fiction movie: two radiation detectors in hand counting furiously, crossing an
abandoned city. </P>
<P>The smoke, driven by fires ten miles away, comes closer.</P>
<P>As the smoke reaches us, the smell of burning wood permeating our protective
masks, we begin to make our way back to the relative safety of our buses.</P>
<P>But we pause for a moment, Gene Stilp and I, and look around. For this truly
is how the world ends, not with a cataclysmic bang, but with a radioactive
whimper.</P>
<P>Not from a sudden blast from an enemy power, but from the steady
contamination of a friendly industrial infrastructure.</P>
<P>Pripyat is the end of the world, it is the apocalypse.</P>
<P>The question is whether Pripyat will be merely the end of the Soviet Union
and an economic and health burden on Ukraine, Belarus, and even Russia for
generations to come, or whether it must be repeated, again and again, until our
Earth's powers recognize that there is no escape from a Chernobyl.</P>
<P>Chernobyl remains a powerful image, because it <I>is</I> a powerful image.
And the radiation from Chernobyl still kills. The fires in the Dead Zone
continue to spread lethal radiation across the countryside. The costs of
Chernobyl continue to outstrip the budgets of all relevant governments.</P>
<P>So this is how the world ends...</P>
<P>A few people in radiation suits come to monitor and witness. Pripyat could
be New York City. Or Washington DC, or Chicago or Philadelphia.</P>
<P>And indeed, those cities will become Pripyat, unless we close nuclear
reactors now.</P>
<P>That's a talent we'd better become a lot better at. We're pretty good at
blocking the nuclear power industry's initiatives; we're not nearly as skilled
at advancing our own agenda.</P>
<P>But the quiet radioactive breeze of Pripyat tells me we'd better learn
quickly.</P>
<P>I have to believe that Pripyat is only one possible future; there are
others. </P>
<P><STRONG>Washington DC, April 26, 1996</STRONG></P>
<P>The Safe Energy Communication Council sponsors a morning Chernobyl
commemoration in Lafayette Park in front of the White House. Still suffering
from jet lag and emotional disruption, I say a few words, trying to speak from
the heart and tell the audience what I saw and what it means.</P>
<P>Afterwards, Valery Kurdyukov, the young Counsel for the Belarus embassy
walks up, shakes my hand, thanks me for my work, and praises my courage for
going to Chernobyl.  I'm dumbfounded. The courage isn't mine, I reply,  I could
leave anytime. The people of Ukraine and Belarus cannot.</P>
<P>They are the ones already living at the end of the world. It is up to the
rest of us to determine whether we have the courage to ensure that Chernobyl is
the last gasp of a dying nuclear age, or whether Chernobyl is the future of a
damaged, dying Earth.</P>

<P>This is the final version of the Memorandum as adopted by the praticipants
of the &quot;Lessons of Chernobyl&quot; Conference in Kiev in April 22. </P>
<P>MEMORANDUM</P>
<P>Ten Lessons from Chernobyl</P>
<P>Kiev, 22 April 1996</P>
<P>On 26 April,1986, Unit Four of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant exploded.
The radioactivity released was several hundred times the combined releases from
the atomic bombs at Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. Vast areas throughout Europe
were contaminated. Chernobyl is etched forever into the memory of humanity as a
place of shame,sorrow and fear.</P>
<P>Ten years later, the warning signal of Chernobyl has gone unheeded. While in
the West (except in France) nuclear production plans have been abandoned because
of runaway costs, cheaper competing technologies and mounting public opposition,
the East has now become the arena for uneconomic investments in new plants or in
upgrading old ones. More than half of the reactors still under construction
today are located in centrally planned electric systems in Eastern Europe and
Asia.</P>
<P>On 20 to 22 April, 1996, two hundred and fifty activists and scientists from
East and West met in Kiev at the invitation of the Heinrich Boell Foundation to
commemorate the catastrophe. What brought us together was a shared awareness of
the urgent necessity to honor those killed and afflicted;</P>
<P>to acknowledge the full human and environmental consequences;</P>
<P>to understand the real costs of nuclear energy;</P>
<P>to explore practical ways to implement safer and cheaper alternatives;</P>
<P>to initiate cooperative action to achieve these goals.</P>
<P>The theme of the conference was the overriding question: What are the
lessons of Chernobyl, and what should we do about them? Our deliberations led to
the following ten lessons:</P>
<P>1. Government agencies have consistently covered up and underestimated the
full consequences.</P>
<P>The health, economic, environmental and psychological effects of the
disaster are more far-reaching and enduring than is officially acknowledged.
Russian, Belarussian and Ukrainian official information about the health status
in the polluted regions show a significant increase of many illness. The
International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA) continues cynically to downplay the
severity of the tragedy and recently argued that no discernible cancer effects
(other than thyroid) have been found, demanding a ten year latency period before
recognizing a cancer as radiation induced. The reality is that 9 million people
were directly affected by the disaster through dislocation, high risk, health
damage or death. One quarter of Belarus' government budget is currently
swallowed up in responding to this disaster.</P>
<P>2. The region's current nuclear policy is unacceptable: it must be
abandoned.The operating reactors at Chernobyl are among the most dangerous in
the world. The continued operation of these reactors as blackmail for foreign
aid is deplorable. We demand that they be shut down immediately rather than &quot;upgraded,&quot;
since safety flaws of this design are too fundamental to repair, and
alternatives cost less. We reject the G7 &quot;Memorandum of Understanding&quot;
which would finish reactors at Khmelnitski and Rovno as replacement power.
Instead we advocate western support for a basic reform of the Ukranian energy
sector, which uses seven times more energy per unit GNP than does Western
Europe.</P>
<P></P>
<P>3. Nuclear Power is inherently unsafe. Chernobyl is not a singular case, but
is symptomatic of the nuclear industry worldwide. Although East European nuclear
facilities are notoriously unsafe, reactor performance in the West has been
unacceptableas well. There are no effective safeguards against theft and
proliferation of fissile materials usable for terrorism or in warfare. After 50
yearsof research and billions of dollars spent, no method has been discovered of
safely isolating radioactive waste from living things. The whole nuclear fuel
chain from uranium mining to waste storage, in which reactors are but one link,
causes unacceptable health and environmental hazards.</P>
<P></P>
<P>4. Nuclear technology is ethically questionable and socially detrimental.
Centralized electricity generating systems based on nuclear power have proven
wasteful, inflexible and expensive. In fostering a &quot;priesthood&quot; of
experts, they are incompatible with emerging civil societies. They are
inherently anti-democratic in the methods required to implement and to safeguard
them. They entail incalculable risks and liabilities across borders and for
unborn future generations, beyond the legal authority of any national
government.</P>
<P></P>
<P>5. The real costs of nuclear power are hidden.Western nuclear industries are
exporting technologies to Eastern Europe and to Asia which cannot be sold at
home. Nuclear power is one of the most expensive sources of energy in large
scale use and in addition it has huge hidden social costs. It survives only
where it is subsidized by our taxes, our health and our future, and is shielded
from fair competition. It also diverts investment away from more desirable
energy options.</P>
<P></P>
<P>6. The 'Aid' from the West, particularly nuclear lending, needs to be
redirected. The European Union/G7's policy of &quot;safety upgrade aid for early
phase-out&quot; has failed. Instead this money is extending the life of
reactors.  Loans from international banks, government credit agencies and
financial institutions support the western nuclear incursion into the East
instead of advancing safer and cheaper options. To date, over two-thirds of
European Investment Bank (EIB) and European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (EBRD) funding has been for energy supply-side options, with less
than 3% directed to end-use efficiency projects and virtually nothing towards
renewables. We call for a fundamental reform of both the Bank and bilateral aid
agency lending policies, based on least-cost options, including energy pricing
that reflects the external costs of nuclear energy along with decommissioning.</P>
<P></P>
<P>7. Alternatives in Eastern Europe are available.The technical and economic
potential for energy efficiency throughout the region is enormous. Even if only
a small proportion were realized, we could close all dangerous reactors in the
region without major economic disruption. For example, in the Ukraine, realistic
savings from energy efficiency gains would be greater than the output of the
Chernobyl complex. A very rapid closure of all reactors might require the
introduction of efficient gas turbines as the efficiency of all resources used
is built up. The longer-term potential for renewable energy based on biomass,
hydro, solar heating, solar electric, and wind power is very large and often
cost-effective today. It should be tapped with an aggressive programme of
research, development and incentives; this would also reduce greenhouse gas
emissions.What is missing is the political will by Eastern European and OECD
governments to invest in the most cost-effective technologies and to redirect
utility incentives towards their implementation.</P>
<P>8. The obstacles to reform are primarily political and institutional, not
technical and economic.The nuclear energy lobby includes a formidable national
and international network of banks, research institutes, regulatory authorities
and even governments. The intricate tie between the military use of nuclear
weapons and the civilian nuclear industry is a major factor. The shifting of
revenues and control away from these powerful groups, due to restructuring the
energy sector, often leads them to oppose the institutional changes needed for a
rational energy policy. Yet the reform would be supported by adopting a
least-cost path first and by making the cheapest option the most profitable
choice for utilities rather than today's perverse system of rewarding utilities
for selling more energy.</P>
<P>9. Public engagement is crucial. An informed and active citizen campaign in
the West helped to stop the nuclear industry. A similar movement, adapted to
local and national conditions, must now gain force in the East, although the
circumstances are far moredifficult. Unless nonprofit NGOs become more
effective, the change in the formulation of energy policy needed to secure a
sustainable energy future is unlikely. The requirement of all civil societies
for democratic control of energy policymaking includes free access to
information, transparency in decision-making and accountability, public
participation and perseverance.</P>
<P>10. Everybody's effort matters. Individuals and groups who oppose nuclear
power and foster sustainable energy options need to be able to count on
international solidarity and cooperation. Participants at the Kiev Conference,
representing some 120 organizations from 30 countries, agree to strengthen
transnational cooperation in their joint search for a sustainable energy future
and demand:</P>
<P>the EIB and Euratom should not be permitted to fund nuclear plants outside
the European Union;</P>
<P>the French and German governments through their export guarantee
organizations - Coface and Hermes -should not fund the completion of the
Mochovce nuclear power plant in Slovakia;</P>
<P>the IAEA should have all nuclear promotional responsibilities converted to
expertise on decommissioning, and a new UN agency promoting energy efficiency
and renewables be established;</P>
<P>the Vienna Convention on nuclear liability should require unlimited
liability for nuclear accidents, in line with all other industries;</P>
<P>exporters of nuclear facilities should be required to ensure the same safety
standards abroad which are required at home;</P>
<P>both international financing and national energy policy should favor and
reward the energy options with lowest social cost;</P>
<P>Slovenian citizens should  have a binding referendum on the early closure of
the Krsko nuclear plant;</P>
<P>Alexander Nikitin, currently imprisoned by the Russian state for compiling
open-source information on nuclear health and safety problems, should be
immediately released; and</P>
<P>Chernobyl victims should get sufficient compensation and relief payments.</P>
<P>These lessons, taken together, lead us to one inescapable conclusion: No
more Chernobyls, anywhere, ever. Let us change track. Let us end dependence on
nuclear power in the East and speed up the shift already underway in the West.
Let us start the widespread implemention of sustainable energy systems which
treat the earth more kindly and cost less. Let us honor the victims of Chernobyl
by making another catastrophe impossible.</P>

<H2>What You Can Do</H2> 
<P>During April 1996, we are encouraging grassroots citizens groups, student
groups, churches, unions and all others to join us in Chernobyl commemoration
activities.
</P>
<H3>Groups</H3>
<P>Local groups will be collecting relief supplies for Chernobyl victims,
including vitamins, over-the-counter medicines (aspirin, etc), food supplements
and baby food. These supplies will be sent to a central warehouse in the U.S.
and shipped to the Ukraine and Bellarus. </P>
<P>In order to further educate the public about the continuing nature of the
Chernobyl disaster, and about nuclear power generally, collection points for
these supplies will be as public as possible. These include outside the offices
of nuclear utilities, waste dump companies and other nuclear fuel cycle
corporations; at reactors and other nuclear sites, at churches, student unions,
and anywhere people gather. Groups may, for example, choose to collect outside a
nuclear utility office one day per week during April 1996, at a student union on
a different day, etc., and hold a press conference/rally on the final day to
announce the results and distribute educational materials. Such materials are
now being prepared. Contact NIRS at 202-328-0002 or
<A HREF="mailto:nirsnet@igc.apc.org">nirsnet@igc.apc.org </A>for more
information.</P>
<H3>Individuals</H3>
<P>Individuals wishing to help in this 10th anniversary Chernobyl relief effort
should check the list of local group activities to see if there is a group near
you already helping.</P>
<P>If there are no other groups near you, or if you are unable to join in with
a particular local group's effort, you may make a contribution directly to NIRS.</P>
<P>There are three types of contributions NIRS is accepting:</P>
<P>1. Contributions to NIRS to defray the costs of the Chernobyl + 10 campaign.</P>
<P>2. Contributions to NIRS which will be pooled together to purchase needed
supplies directly from the manufacturers. NIRS keeps 5% of such contributions
for our accounting and other overhead. The rest goes entirely to relief
supplies.</P>
<P>3. Contributions to NIRS which will be forwarded to Eastern European
environmental groups working to close reactors throughout Eastern Europe and the
former Soviet Union. Even very small contributions can make a big difference to
these groups.</P>
<P>In each case, contributions should be mailed to NIRS, 1424 16th Street NW,
Suite 404, Washington, DC 20036; 202-328-0002. NIRS is a 501(c)(3) organization;
all contributions are fully tax-deductible. Please be sure to indicate on your
check which of these efforts you want your contribution to be directed toward.
Thank you for your help.</P>

<H1><STRONG>Chernobyl Relief: What is Needed</STRONG>...</H1>
<HR>

<P>
The Chernobyl nuclear accident of April 26, 1986 has had devastating
consequences on the people of Ukraine and Belarus in particular.
31 people, mostly firefighters, died almost immediately after
the accident. But the disaster's real toll is only now beginning
to come clear. Much of the radiation released by Chernobyl is
still in the area, soaked up in the ground, brought back to surface
by plant roots and livestock. Unlike other industrial catastrophes,
Chernobyl is truly an accident without end. 
<P>
Thousands of people were evacuated from a 30 kilometer (18 mile)
area around the stricken reactor shortly after the accident. Many
of these were simply resettled in other contaminated areas. Since
the accident, hundreds of thousands more were moved to other areas
because of high contamination levels. Even so, millions of Ukrainians,
Belarussians and Russians still live in contaminated areas, and
eat contaminated food.
<P>
Radiation not only causes cancers, it attacks the immune system,
making people more vulnerable to other diseases. Children are
particularly susceptible to radiation's effects. Today, Belarus
is spending 20% of the its annual budget on Chernobyl-related
costs; the larger Ukraine spends 4% of its budget. By comparison,
the U.S. Medicare program accounts for 13% of our annual budget;
our foreign aid program for less than 2%.
<P>
In the United States, we will be collecting needed supplies for
Chernobyl victims. With United Nations aid nearly non-existent,
it is time for the people of the world to respond to this tragedy
as generously as we respond to earthquakes, floods and other natural
disasters. The supplies we are collecting are needed to bolster
the immune system, protect the children, and alleviate the suffering.
<HR>

<P>
Specifically, we seek the following items. All goods must be in
the original, unopened packaging with a minimum remaining shelf
life of six months:
<P>
<STRONG>Vitamins:</STRONG> especially multivitamins (e.g. One-A-Day).
Brand names are not important. Also needed are specific vitamins,
such as Vitamin C (chewable for children and adult dosages, Vitamin
B complexes, Vitamin A and Vitamin E.
<P>
<STRONG>Over-the Counter Medicines:</STRONG> these include non-prescription
drugs such as aspirin (both children's and adult); ibuprofen (Advil,
etc.); acetaminopin (Tylenol, etc.); anti-bacterial ointments;
anti-fungal ointments; anti-diarrheal medicine; cold tablets and
formulas; cough syrups (children's and adults); and antacids (Rolaid,
Maalox, etc.). Either generics or brand-names are welcome.
<P>
<STRONG>Baby Food:</STRONG> this includes typical baby food such
as jars from Gerbers, Heinz, Earth's Best, etc; as well as boxed
baby cereals and other packaged foods.
<P>
<STRONG>Food Supplements:</STRONG> These include basic minerals
and other products designed to enhance vitamin intake and retention,
and detoxify and fortify immune systems. Suggested supplements
include zinc, calcium, selenium, garlic tablets or liquid (Kyolic,
etc.), and acidophilous capsules.
<P>
We will <STRONG>not</STRONG> collect normal canned food, any fresh
items, clothes or other bulky items, or anything not on the above,
targeted list. Let's collect what the people need.
<P>
Local organizations will be responsible for shipping collected
items to a warehouse in Dover, New Jersey, run by Children of
Chornobyl. We will provide full shipping instructions before April
1996. Because you will bear the costs of shipping, you may wish
to collect some funds to pay for this. If there are large donors
who wish to purchase significant amounts of supplies you may either
buy these directly, or send them to NIRS where we will work to
obtain goods from at warehouse prices. Note, contributions for
supplies made through NIRS are fully tax-deductible. NIRS keeps
5% of all such contributions to cover our administrative costs.

<CENTER><H1>STOP A</H1></CENTER>
<CENTER><H1>MOBILE CHERNOBYL</H1></CENTER>
<P>The Chernobyl nuclear accident of April 1986 was the world's worst
industrial and environmental disaster. According to the Public Health Service of
Ukraine, more than 125,000 people already have died as a direct result of
Chernobyl. Other estimates are lower, but still highly significant: for example,
writing in the April 1996 <I>Scientific American</I>, Yuri Shcherbak, Ukraine's
Ambassador to the United States and an expert in epidemiology, estimates more
than 30,000 have died. The Belarus government says thousands of people,
especially children, are suffering from various forms of cancer and other
disease, as a direct result of the Chernobyl calamity.</P>
<P>The Chernobyl accident resulted in the release to the environment of a
significant portion of the reactor's radioactive nuclear core. According to
various governmental sources, some 100 million curies of radiation may have been
released during the accident and afterwards. This radiation settled primarily on
a large area of Ukraine and Belarus, and, because it has been impossible to
fully evacuate people from hazardous zones, the radiation continues to
contaminate food and water supplies--making the accident a diaster without end.</P>
<P>Some argue that the Chernobyl reactor was an inferior design, and such an
accident could not happen in the U.S. While the Chernobyl design does have
shortcomings, the radiation containment system for the Chernobyl reactors was
modeled after that used in 24 U.S. nuclear plants--called General Electric Mark
I reactors. The system failed dramatically at Chernobyl; shortly afterwards, a
top Nuclear Regulatory Commission official estimated the 24 U.S. reactors using
similar containment systems had a 90% chance of failure during a severe
accident.</P>
<P>Nuclear reactors, whether in the Ukraine or in the U.S. are built to attempt
to withstand major nuclear accidents. Their goal is to keep highly radioactive
nuclear fuel from reaching the environment. Obviously, this didn't work at
Chernobyl and it might not in the U.S. either.</P>
<H1>A Mobile Chernobyl in the United States?</H1>
<P>Now, the United States Congress wants to begin moving that same highly
radioactive nuclear fuel from nuclear power plant sites to Nevada. The fuel,
once removed from the reactor core (where it becomes lethally radioactive), is
considered radioactive waste. To ease the financial problems of a few nuclear
utilities, which have run out of room to store their own radioactive waste, some
Congressmembers want to move this lethal material to an &quot;interim&quot;
storage site in Nevada, near Yucca Mountain, where Congress hopes a permanent
waste dump will be built.</P>
<P>This movement of deadly nuclear fuel would travel through 43 states, many of
our largest cities (New York, Chicago, Washington, Philadelphia, Los Angeles,
and more), our agricultural heartland, and ultimately could affect the 150
million or so Americans which live within 50 miles of one of these
transportation routes.</P>
<P>And to what end? Solely to move this high-level radioactive waste away from
the utilities which generated it, and to a state which has never had a nuclear
power plant. It is the ultimate in the &quot;not-in-my-backyard&quot; syndrome.
Rather than maintain this waste, guard it, ensure that it doesn't enter the
environment, the nuclear utilities want to move it across your backyard, down
your interstate, across your railroad tracks and through your food supply--all
so they can claim the nuclear waste problem is &quot;solved.&quot; Of course,
the problem wouldn't be solved; nuclear waste would continue to pile up at
reactors, it would just pile up on train tracks and highways as well.</P>
<P>Each large nuclear waste cask would carry the long-lived radiological
equivalent of some 200 Hiroshima-sized nuclear bombs. Can you imagine your local
emergency personnel being able to handle such a catastrophe if a cask like this
derailed in your neighhborhood?</P>
<P>What's more, once the waste is moved away from reactor sites, the title to
the waste--and the liability if an accident occurs--transfers from the utilities
to the taxpayers.</P>
<P>Fortunately, there is a better way, and that's to leave the deadly waste
where it is--where it was generated by nuclear utilities--until our nation has
had the opportunity to completely re-evaluate its radioactive waste policies.
</P>
<H1>What's your idea?</H1>
<P>But, so far, Congress has a different idea. Many Congressmembers are
supporting HR 1020 in the House, or S 1271 in the Senate, which would mandate
large-scale radioactive waste transportation, as early as 1998.</P>
<P>You can help stop this potential mobile Chernobyl. Call (202-224-2131) or
write (US House, Washington DC 20515 and/or US Senate, Washington DC 20510) and
urge your federal elected officials to <B>oppose</B> HR 1020 and S 1271. Call
(202-456-1100) or write (White House, Washington DC, 20500) President Clinton
and demand that he <B>veto</B> any bill which would put into effect large-scale
radioactive waste transportation to an &quot;interim&quot; nuclear dump.</P>
<P>Ask your friends and neighbors to sign the Don't Waste America petition,
which calls for an end to generation of deadly nuclear waste, and for an
independent commission to re-examine our nation's failed nuclear waste policies.
Call radio talk shows, write letters to the editor, and ask your friends to
become active as well. Ask your city and county councils to pass resolutions
against unnecessary and dangerous nuclear waste transportation. Together, we can
stop a mobile Chernobyl, and work to implement a sound radioactive waste policy.
On the 10th anniversary of the world's worst industrial/environmental disaster,
we must do no less.</P>

<H1>Chernobyl--Basic Facts</H1> 
<H3>The RBMK-1000 Reactor </H3> 
<P>The Chernobyl reactor complex just 80 miles north of Kiev, Ukraine is made
up of four Russian made RBMK-1000 water-cooled graphite moderated reactor
designed to make plutonium for nuclear weapons and modified to also produce
electricity. There are 27 RBMK's in the former Soviet Union. One distinguishing
feature of the RBMK design is its use of graphite to slow the neutrons produced
by the fissioning of uranium-235 atoms. Besides the RBMK reactors, the U.S.
Department of Energy operated a graphite-moderated reactor at Hanford,
Washington for the dual purpose of producing military plutonium and electricity
up until the aftermath of the Chernobyl accident. Within the reactor core of a
RBMK, nuclear fuel is placed in long separate vertical channels surrounded by
graphite, which is expected to absorb large amounts of heat as a safety feature
to give reactor operators ample time to take corrective action in the event of
an accident.
</P>
<P>While significant differences in both design and construction exist between
the Chernobyl-style reactor and U.S. commercial power reactors, the nuclear
accident stands as an indictment of nuclear power technology and the
catastrophic consequences inherent in the fissioning of the uranium atom to
generate steam for electricity.
</P>
<HR>
<H3>The Ongoing Consequences of the Nuclear Accident </H3> 
<P>At 1:23 a.m. on April 26, 1986, a catastrophic nuclear accident demolished
Chernobyl Unit 4. Power plant operators lost control of the reactor while
conducting experiments at low power. In an enormous explosion of the reactor
core, a mammoth amount of heat and disintegrated radioactive fuel violently
erupted into the atmosphere. An atomic fire burned for days before Swedish
authorities alerted the world to the return of nuclear fallout spewed high into
the atmosphere. Only months early, <I>Soviet Life</I> had propagandized that
operating the Chernobyl nuclear power plants was &quot;safer than driving a car.&quot;
</P>
<P>The facts are still coming forward:
</P>
<P>There is roughly a 36 mile diameter &quot;dead zone&quot; surrounding the
reactors from which over 160,000 people were evacuated, permanently abandoning
over 600 years of continuous habitation and culture around the towns of
Chernobyl and Pripyat. Numerous &quot;hot spots&quot; of radioactive
contamination persist far beyond a &quot;zone of alienation;&quot; many areas
continue to emit radioactivity at levels ranging from 40 to 100
curies/kilometer2. As many as 150,000 people were dislocated in Belarus and
75,000 in the Russian Federation.</P>
<P>It is estimated that nearly 80% of Belarus was hit by iodine-131 fallout at
1000 curies/kilometer2, but because this isotope is short-lived (80 day
hazardous-life) it was omitted from the long-term forecasts and analysis despite
its extremely significant health consequences.
</P>
<P>Vast tracks of agricultural land and bodies of water have been poisoned in
Ukraine, Belarus, western Russia, with significant radioactive contamination
persisting as far away as Poland, Norway and Sweden .
</P>
<P>In an effort to avert a second nuclear catastrophe at the site, the
international atomic industry puzzles over its next move to prevent or contain
the eventual collapse of the colossal concrete tomb hastily erected at great
human sacrifice as a biological barrier. The concrete pillars supporting the &quot;sarcophagus&quot;
are crumbling and ready to burst over the highly radioactive remains of the
damaged reactor, which would result in another catastrophic airborne release of
radioactive particulate to the environment.
</P>
<P>Wind and water continue to spread Chernobyl's deadly radioactive
contamination over even wider areas. Ground water flowing under the damaged
Chernobyl reactor is spreading an underground radioactive plume into the Pripyat
and Dnieper Rivers, threatening the city of Kiev's water supply.
</P>
<P>Now, nearly ten years later, the Ukrainian government estimates 8000 people
have died in their country from the nuclear accident as a result of
radiation-related illness. The Ukrainian Ministry of Health places that figure
at 125,000 with disease rates, miscarriages and birth defects steadily rising.
Officials in Belarus estimate that roughly 2 million have suffered in some way
as a result of the nuclear meltdown. Birth rates have fallen 50% in Belarus.
Over 3 million Russians were exposed to the radioactive fallout in 1986. An
estimated 370,000 Russians are believed at significant risk for radiation
illness according to a recent Moscow medical conference. The relocation of
hundreds of thousands of people from additional contaminated zones has ground to
a halt for economic reasons, as has radiation monitoring of farming produce in
the zones.
</P>
<P>According to United Nation sources, Belarus currently spends 20% of its
national budget dealing with the Chernobyl aftermath while Ukraine devotes 4% of
its budget. In a report prepared by the Minister for Extraordinary Situations
and Protection of the Population from the Consequences of the Chernobyl
Catastrophe, the estimated total cost to Belarus from 1986 to 2016 is the
equivalent of 32 annual budgets from the republic's pre-accident period.
</P>
<HR>
<H3>Chernobyl's Implications For U.S. Nuclear Reactors </H3> 
<P>The U.S. nuclear power industry is quick to point out that the Chernobyl
accident was a unique event that could never be repeated at a Westinghouse,
General Electric, Babcock and Wilcox or Combustion Engineering design. The
industry claims that Chernobyl was the product of a severely flawed reactor
design that could never be licensed to operate in the United States. Industry
proponents continue to claim that all U.S. nuclear reactors are designed to
ensure that radioactive materials would be contained in the event of a serious
accident. However, Chernobyl also had a containment building. The accident was
so severe that the containment design failed. Considerable evidence indicates
that U.S. containment designs can also fail. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory
Commission (NRC) in a 1990 study of the risks associated with severe accidents
at U.S. nuclear power plants concluded that none of the five different designs
it analyzed were capable of remaining intact during a severe accident. In
another NRC study of 24 U.S. reactors using General Electric's Mark 1
containment design, NRC concluded that &quot;failure within the first few hours
following core melt would appear rather likely.&quot;
</P>
<P>All aging U.S. nuclear reactors are vulnerable to component failure and
human error in design, construction and operation. Any U.S. nuclear reactor
could have an accident resulting in a catastrophic release of radiation to the
American public with similar or worse consequences as evidenced by Chernobyl.

<H2>PUBLIC COMMENT NEEDED BY FEBRUARY 9, 1997</H2>
<H2>NRC DRAFT POLICY NUCLEAR UTILITY RESTRUCTURING</H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;We're concerned about the 'other guy' selling kilowatts more cheaply
than we do, so we have to restructure to reduce our bottom-line costs to become
more competitive.&quot; South Texas Project Electric Generating Station
information systems</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission issued a Draft Policy Statement On
Restructuring and Economic Deregulation of the Electric Utility Industry in the
Federal Register on September 23, 1996. [Fed. Reg. Volume 61, Number 185, Page
49711-49714].</P>
<P>The NRC has extended the opportunity for public comment to February 9, 1996 
on the regulator's draft policy concerning safety impacts on nuclear industry
resulting from the deregulation and restructuring of the electric utility
industry.</P>
<P>The NRC draft policy statement and a complete copy of NIRS' comments will be
made available upon request to NIRS and on our web site, (www.nirs.org).</P>
<P>The U.S. electric utility industry has entered a period of economic
deregulation and restructuring which will lead to increased competition in the
electricity industry. Utility deregulation could cause some nuclear utilities to
break up by divesting their reactors from their transmission and distribution
assets. Utility mergers, corporate spin-offs, and other other forms of
restructuring can ultimately change the corporate entity which legally owns,
operates, and carries the liability for nuclear reactors. Of major concern,
current owners could legally cease to be the &quot;electric utility&quot;
originally licensed by NRC to operate the nuclear reactor.  NRC currently
believes that the federal agency's primary concerns with utility deregulation
should focus on the adequacy of the licensees' decommissioning funds.
Principally, NRC is concerned with the degree and pace at which utility
deregulation and restructuring occur and how those changes could affect previous
NRC conclusions about the licensees' ability to provide adequate funds for safe
operation and decommissioning through direct access to the rate base.</P>
<P>By the authority of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 and through a final
version of this policy paper, NRC intends to &quot;increase cooperation with
State and Federal rate and financial regulators to &quot;promote dialogue&quot;
and &quot;minimize the possibility of rate deregulation or other actions that
would have an adverse safety impact.&quot;</P>
<P>Electric utility deregulation poses an increase in nuclear hazards.  NIRS
strongly encourages the consumer advocacy and public safety communities to
participate in this &quot;dialogue&quot; by filing comments on the NRC draft
policy statement by February 9, 1997.</P>
<P>The public and its representatives need to be aware of theunique hazards and
complexities associated with nuclear powerand electric utility restructuring. As
the nuclear power industry is rapidly aging with mounting evidence of 
significant degradation to safety systems, nuclear utilities are in the least
favorable position to reduce their &quot;bottom-line costs&quot; for this
inherently dangerous technology. As a result of competitive pressure, nuclear
utility efforts to control costs are more likely to result in the steady erosion
of worker and publicsafety margins. In one recent example of the direct result
of economic pressure, Northeast Utilities was exposed for knowingly violating
their NRC license. During the refueling operation of Connecticut's Millstone
Unit 1 reactor, the company routinely ignored a mandated 250-hour cool down in
order to speed the procedure to 60 hours without fully analyzing the procedure's
safety. Similarly, Northeast Utilities' Millstone Units 2 , 3 and the now
permanently closed Haddam Neck reactor in Connecticut were discovered to have
operated out of regulatory compliance and outside of the bounds of the utility's
documented safety analysis as a result of management decisions designed to cut
costs. In an increasingly deregulated market, more utilities face pressure to &quot;re-evaluate&quot;
or outright ignore safety regulations in order to compete with safer and more
economical generators of electricity.</P>
<P>The NRC draft policy statement does not adequately address nuclear hazards
brought on by the economic pressures of utility deregulation and restructuring.
The NRC must put public safety over the economic interests of the nuclear
utilities. The following examples point to the need for a more thorough NRC
analysis of the adverse impact of utility deregulation on nuclear power
generating stations.</P>
<P>1.)  As a direct result of increased competition, aging nuclear power
reactors are extending their operational cycles to longer and longer
periods--from 12 months to 18 months to 24 months. Such extensions seek to
reduce the utilities' operation and maintenance costs but undermine public
safety by lengthening the periods between surveillance, testing, inspection, and
maintenance of safety-related systems. This cost-saving trend occurs at
precisely the wrong time for the nuclear industry. Nuclear reactors already are
experiencing signs of accelerating deterioration due to &quot;premature&quot;
aging of susceptible materials that make up safety-related systems such as steam
generators, reactor pressure vessels, and reactor core internal components.</P>
<P><STRONG>NIRS contends that the NRC should curtail operating cycles longer
than 18 months. NRC should then require the utility to significantly increase
the degree of  inspections of safety-related systems following an 18 month
operating cycle with the reactor shutdown.</STRONG></P>
<P>2.)  Utility deregulation further impacts reactor safety by encouraging
utilities to shorten their outage time for refueling and conduct more &quot;on-line
maintenance&quot; to a wider range of systems, structures and components. This
procedure intentionally disables safety-related equipment to perform
inspections, tests and maintenance with the reactor at full power. While NRC
states that it is seeking to minimize the adverse safety impact from utility
deregulation, the agency currently allows more on-line maintenance despite staff
warnings &quot;that some licensees are performing more maintenance on-line
without assessing the risk consequences.&quot;</P>
<P><STRONG>NIRS contends that this trend represents a dangerous erosion to the
public safety margin by subordinating the &quot;defense-in-depth&quot;
philosophy in the licensee's design basis and technical specifications to
mounting competitive pressure.</STRONG></P>
<P>3.)  Utility deregulation will likely compound the already apparent
underaccrualment for nuclear decommissioning and waste costs through the &quot;fund
as you go&quot; approach. Nuclear power stands in dramatic contrast to its
competitors because of the decommissioning and nuclear waste issue. The rapid
inflation of decommissioning and nuclear waste costs will continue to out-pace
the amount of the utilities' collected funds. This economic reality warns that
increased energy competition and consumers choosing alternate electricity
sources will likely result in utility defaults on decommissioning and nuclear
waste funding.</P>
<P><STRONG>NIRS supports a call for nuclear utilities be required to set-aside
adequate funds for decommissioning and nuclear waste management in upfront
external accounts.</STRONG></P>

<h1>URGENT ALERT! MOBILE CHERNOBYL ACT HAS REACHED SENATE FLOOR! IT HAS
A NEW NUMBER--S. 1936 (IT WAS S. 1271). CALLS, FAXES, E-MAIL, LETTERS NEEDED
TO THE SENATE!!</h1>

<p>The &quot;Mobile Chernobyl Act&quot; is now being debated and filibustered
on the Senate floor. A final vote could occur as early as Monday, July
15, though it is more likely later in the week. </p>

<p>As you probably know, S. 1271 (now rennumbered as S. 1936) is best known
as the &quot;Mobile Chernobyl Act.&quot; It would set up an &quot;interim&quot;
storage dump for high-level radioactive waste near Yucca Mountain, Nevada.
It would begin the unprecedented transportation of some 15,000 or more
large canisters of high-level radioactive waste on our nation's highways
and railways. More than 50 million people, in 43 states and the District
of Columbia, live within just two miles of these waste thruways. The bill
also would remove nearly every major environmental law from the radioactive
waste issue, and would trample on the authority of states to protect their
residents from hazardous projects. S. 1936 masquerades as a &quot;solution&quot;
for the radioactive waste issue; in reality, it just adds to the problem.</p>

<p>For all these reasons, President Clinton has promised to veto this bill.</p>

<p>There are a few changes in S. 1936, most seem to have been made to make
the bill more &quot;reasonable,&quot; and perhaps avoid a presidential
veto. But the bill can't be made reasonable and Senators need to know a
few cosmetic changes won't reduce the public's opposition. The nuclear
industry has been waging its own &quot;grassroots&quot; campaign in favor
of the bill. This is it! We must step up our activities.</p>

<p>Senate Majority Leader Lott and Energy Committee Chairman Murkowski
wanted Nevada Senators Bryan and Reid to limit their filibuster efforts.
Fortunately, the two said no, so a filibuster fight will be on. The key
vote will be a &quot;cloture&quot; vote, which is used to cut off a filibuster.
To win (to keep the filibuster going), Bryan and Reid need 40 votes. Please
call your Senators, and ask them to 1) oppose S. 1936; 2) support the Bryan/Reid
filibuster and oppose the &quot;cloture&quot; vote; 3) actively support
the filibuster by speaking on the Senate floor. 4) Then, when you hang
up the phone, please call a friend and ask him/her to take steps 1 through
4 as well. </p>

<p>If your Senator is already opposed to the bill, emphasize support for
the filibuster. Even if your Senator is completely committed to S 1936
(or is a co-sponsor), it is important for Senate offices to know that the
opposition is out there and nationwide. Some people may think it is impolite
to call their Senator's office more than once. But Senate staffers just
as often think you don't care any more if you don't stay in regular touch--they
need to know they can count on you to provide political cover if their
boss actually decides to represent YOU. And the change in bill number offers
a perfect opportunity to call again, even if you're written and called
before. PLEASE CALL TODAY, let your Senator know that you can't dress up
a turkey and expect to get a swan. S. 1936 is still the Mobile Chernobyl
Act and must be defeated. </p>

<p>ALWR VOTE LIKELY JULY 17</p>

<p>The U.S. House of Representatives is likely to vote on the future of
the Advanced Light Water Reactor (ALWR) Program around July 17. Reps. Obey
and Foley intend to offer an amendment (to the Energy and Water Appropriations
bill) to delete all funding for this program, which offers a direct subsidy
to the world's largest corporations to work on reactor designs that probably
will never be used.</p>

<p>Most of the money this year would go to the Westinghouse AP-600 reactor
(General Electric and ABB/Combustion Engineering are also program beneficiaries),
for which no U.S. utility has expressed interest. (GE recently even stopped
work on one of its new &quot;advanced&quot; designs, also a 600 MW model,
because of lack of utility interest).</p>

<p>Under the 1992 Energy Policy Act, funding is to be provided only for
those reactor designs with a potential for domestic sales--clearly not
the case here. Further, the funding was set to expire after five years,
yet the program is now entering its sixth year. And the funding was intended
only for designs which could achieve design certification by FY 1996--the
AP 600 isn't scheduled for review until at least FY 1997, and probably
later.</p>

<p>The Clinton administration had asked for $40 million for this program
in FY 1997. An Appropriations subcommittee July 10 cut that number to $17
million. But there likely will be efforts to increase that amount later.</p>

<p>The Obey/Foley amendment, however, would end the program completely--and
that's the message we want to send to the House. Contact your representatives
and ask them to vote FOR the Obey/Foley amendment to the Energy and Water
Appropriations bill, and to end this waste of taxpayer money once and for
all.</p>

<p>For more information on the amendment, contact Jim Adams at Safe Energy
Communication Council, 202-483-8491.</p>

<H1>S. 1936, Update Number 2</H1>
<P>July 16, 1996, 3 pm</P>
<P>This morning, in its first vote related to S. 1936, the Senate voted 65-34
in favor of &quot;cloture&quot; on the motion to proceed on S. 1936. This means
that the Senate voted to end the filibuster of Nevada Senators Reid and Bryan on
the issue of whether S. 1936 can come to the floor. Tomorrow, Wednesday, at 1
pm, there will be a vote on the issue of whether the bill can come to the floor.
Then, it is our understanding that Reid and Bryan still intend to filibuster the
bill itself, which will result in at least one more cloture vote; it appears
that vote probably cannot occur before Friday. If cloture is approved at that
time, then the bill itself can be voted on, but almost certainly not before next
week.</P>
<P>In addition, there is a possibility Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott will
try to bring up other legislation in the meantime. Two possibilities are the
defense appropriations bill and welfare reform. Bryan and Reid still have a
filibuster going against defense appropriations, and conceivably could
filibuster welfare reform as well.</P>
<P>If all this sounds confusing--well, it is. That's the nature of the Senate
rules. The most important vote will be the cloture vote on the filibuster of the
bill itself--that's the vote that may take place Friday--we will keep you
posted.</P>
<H3>THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT THIS FIRST VOTE GARNERED 34 VOTES--THAT IS THE EXACT
NUMBER NEEDED TO SUSTAIN A PRESIDENTIAL VETO!</H3>
<P>Our numbers are likely to only go up from here, making it more likely that
Lott will eventually have to withdraw the bill. And momentum seems to be
swinging our way. Yesterday, the White House sent a letter to the Senate
restating its intention to veto S. 1936. This morning, the Washington Post
published a strong lead editorial against S. 1936 (text enclosed).</P>
<P><STRONG>HERE IS WHAT TO DO NOW:</STRONG> Enclosed is the list of 34
Senators who voted with Bryan and Reid (against cloture). If your senator(s) are
on this list, please call, fax or e-mail them and thank them for their vote and
urge them to continuing supporting the filibuster. If your senator(s) are not on
the list, please call, fax or e-mail them, point out that S. 1936 now has enough
opposition to sustain a promised presidential veto, and that it is a pointless
waste of time to proceed any further with this bill. Doing so will only prevent
the Senate from addressing other needed legislation.</P>
<H2><STRONG>CAPITOL SWITCHBOARD: 202-224-3121</STRONG></H2>
<P>If you have not yet called your Senators about this issue, it's time to do
so. If you have not yet asked your parents, your kids, your grandparents, your
next-door neighbor, your friend down the street, to call the Senate--please do
so today.</P>
<P>The message is simple: Support the Bryan/Reid filibuster. Oppose S. 1936.</P>
<P>To Senator Lott's office: Withdraw S. 1936, it will be vetoed and the veto
will be sustained. Work on needed legislation.</P>
<P>Here is the list of Senators who voted in favor of Bryan/Reid (against
cloture)</P>
<P>Ford, Ken. Bryan, Nev. Reid, Nev. Conrad, N. Dak. Daschle, S. Dak.
Lieberman, Conn. Dodd, Conn. Moynihan, N.Y., Rockefeller, W.Va. Byrd, W.Va.,
Biden, Delaware Pell, R.I. Campbell, Colo. Kennedy, Mass. Kerry, Mass. Feingold,
Wisc. Wyden, Ore., Pryor, Ark. Bumpers, Ark. Akaka, Hawaii Inouye, Hawaii
Mikulski, Md. Sarbanes, Md. Bingaman, N.M. Harkin, Iowa, Exon, Neb., Kerrey,
Neb. Baucus, Mont. Feinstein, Calif. Boxer, Calif. Glenn, Ohio Dorgan, N. Dak.
Graham, Fla. Coats, Indiana.</P>
<P>All but Campbell and Coats are Democrats.</P>
<P>E-mail addresses of Senators are available on NIRS' web site. For technical
reasons, you cannot currently mail to Senators from our web site, but you can
get the address.</P>
<P>Another thing that needs to be done this week is to bring up the topic of
Senate gridlock on radio and tv talk shows, and point out that it is not
Bryan/Reid who are causing the Senate's inability to pass legislation, it is
Majority Leader Lott. Lott is the one insisting on continuing with this bill,
despite the fact that it will be vetoed and the veto likely will be sustained.
By not withdrawing this bill, Lott is ensuring that filibusters will continue
and legislation will continue to be held up. All for a bill which almost
certainly cannot be enacted.</P>
<P>Here are some phone numbers of popular national talk shows. But listen to
and call talk shows in your area too. Note: times of talk shows often vary from
location to location, so check your local station.</P>

<P>Here is the text of the Washington Post editorial of July 16, 1996:</P>
<P>The Washington Post</P>
<P>AN INDEPENDENT NEWSPAPER TUESDAY,  JULY 16, 1996</P>
<P>Waste Makes Haste</P>
<P>NUCLEAR POWER has not turned out to be the blessing the advance men said it
would. Among much else, they presented it as clean_no more burning of gritty
coal_but in the matter of cleanliness, it has a ghastly problem of its own. The
nuclear issue is waste disposal_what to do with the enormously toxic spent fuel
rods for which there currently is no long-term home.</P>
<P>The idea was that the utilities would store the spent fuel in the short run,
while the government created a permanent storage facility. To put it charitably,
the government has been slow to fulfill its part of the bargain. Technology has
been one reason; it's hard to determine how best to deal, over what will likely
be many generations, with a product as nasty as this. Politics also have been a
problem; for obvious reasons, no one wants the stuff.</P>
<P>In the 1980s Congress fastened on Yucca Mountain in Nevada as a likely
permanent repository. Nevadans resisted the idea, but Texas and Washington, the
other candidates, were more powerfully represented in the House and able to
duck. The necessary work to settle definitely on Yucca Mountain has gone slowly,
however. The judgments are hard, and the Energy Department over the years bas
been less than a model of efficiency. So now the industry is trying to force the
issue. Anxious to rid itself of the accumulating waste and the liability that it
represents, and fearful that the federal studies could bog down, the nuclear
lobby is pushing a bill to designate an &quot;interim&quot; storage site in
Nevada that would not have to meet all the standards of a permanent facility.
Nevadans see the proposal as a stalking horse to create what would amount to a
permanent facility by another name. The state's two senators have been holding
up other legislation to keep the storage measure from coming to a vote. A
cloture vote will be held today to cut off their filibuster; they expect to
lose. But the president also has threatened a veto, and that the Nevadans think
they could sustain.</P>
<P>We hope they do, if necessary. The interim bill is the wrong way to solve
what is not yet a fully urgent problem. It may well be that there is no
alternative to permanent storage_some people think a timely way may yet be found
to detoxify the waste instead. It also may be that Yucca Mountain is the best
available site. But this is too important a decision to be jammed through the
latter part of a Congress on the strength of the industry's fabricated claim
that it faces an emergency. On this one, members should imagine the worst--that
bunching and storing the waste will produce the eventual environmental disaster
that some of the critics predict. Then ask themselves, which among them want to
sign their names to that?</P> 
<P>As always, thanks for your help, keep it up! We CAN WIN this one!</P>

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>White House Letter, 7/15/96</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY>
<P>THE WHITE HOUSE</P>
<P>WASHINGTON</P>
<P>July 15, 1996</P>
<P>The Honorable Thomas A. Daschle</P>
<P>United States Senate</P>
<P>Washington, DC  20510</P>
<P>Dear Senator Daschle:</P>
<P>I would like to express the Administration's position on S. 1936, a bill to
create a centralized interim high-level nuclear waste storage facility in
Nevada.  The Administration cannot support this bill, and the President would
veto it if the bill were presented to him in its present form.</P>
<P>The Administration believes it is important to continue work on a permanent
geologic repository.  According to the National Academy of Science, there is a
world-wide scientific consensus that permanent geologic disposal is the best
option for disposing of commercial and other high-level nuclear waste.  This is
why the Administration has emphasized cutting costs and improving the management
and performance of the permanent site characterization efforts underway at Yucca
Mountain, Nevada.  The Department of Energy has been making significant progress
in recent years and is on schedule to determine the viability of the site in
1998.</P>
<P>Designating the Nevada Test Site as the interim waste site, as S. 1936
effectively does, will undermine the ongoing Yucca Mountain evaluation work by
siphoning away resources.  Perhaps more importantly, the enactment of this bill
will destroy the credibility of the Nation's nuclear waste disposal program by
prejudicing the Yucca Mountain permanent repository decision.  Choosing a site
for an interim storage facility should be based upon objective science-based
criteria and should not be made before the viability of the Yucca site is
determined in the next two years.  This viability assessment, undertaken by the
Department of Energy, will be completed by 1998.</P>
<P>Some have alleged that we need to move spent commercial fuel rods to a
central interim site now.   According to a recent report from the Nuclear Waste
Technical Review Board (NWTRB), an independent board established by Congress,
there is no technical or safety reason to move spent fuel to an interim central
storage facility for the next several years.  The Nuclear Regulatory Commission
(NRC) has determined that current technology and methods of storing spent fuel
at reactors are safe.  If they were not safe, the NRC would not license these
storage facilities.  Also, the NWTRB assures us that adequate at-reactor storage
space is, and will remain, available for many years.</P>
<P>In S. 1936, the Nevada Test Site is the default site, even if it proves to
be unsuitable for the permanent repository.  This is bad policy.  This bill has
many other problems, including those that present serious environmental
concerns.  The bill weakens existing environmental standards by preempting all
Federal, state and local laws and applying only the environmental requirements
of this bill and the Atomic Energy Act.  The results of this preemption include:
 replacing the Environmental Protection Agency's authority to set acceptable
radiation release standards with a statutory standard considerably in excess of
the exposure permitted by current regulations; creating loopholes in the
National Environmental Policy Act;  and eliminating current licensing
requirements for a permanent repository.</P>
<P>I hope that you will not support S. 1936.  It is an unfair, unneeded, and
unworkable bill.  We have the time to develop legislation and plan for an
interim storage facility in a fairer and scientifically valid way while being
sensitive to the concerns of all affected parties.  This includes those in
Nevada, those along the rail and roadways over which the nuclear waste will
travel, and those who depend on and live near the current operating commercial
nuclear power plants.</P>
<P>Thank you for your consideration of these views.</P>
<P>Sincerely,</P>
<P>Leon Panetta</P>
<P>Chief of Staff</P>

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>NIRS letter to Sen. Lott, 7/17/97</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY>
<P>July 17, 1996</P>
<P>Hon. Trent Lott</P>
<P>Senate Majority Leader</P>
<P>U.S. Senate</P>
<P>Washington, DC 20510</P>
<P>Dear Majority Leader Lott:</P>
<P>We call on you to withdraw S. 1936, the &quot;Mobile Chernobyl Act,&quot;
from the Senate floor, and to not bring up this issue again this term.</P>
<P>The developments of the past two days underscore what bill opponents have
maintained all along: President Clinton has reiterated that he will veto this
bill, and yesterday's procedural vote indicates that bill opponents have the 34
votes necessary to sustain a veto.</P>
<P>Indeed,  several Members who voted for cloture yesterday will not oppose the
President on a veto override vote just a few short weeks before a national
election. The margin voting to sustain a veto may be quite a bit larger than
yesterday's vote indicates.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, continuing with this unnecessary and dangerous legislation will
continue to delay Senate consideration of other important policy matters and
appropriations bills. The gridlock you criticized last week likely will
continue. Now, however, it is clear that it is the supporters of S. 1936 who are
causing the gridlock, by continuing to pursue a bill which surely cannot be
enacted.</P>
<P>S. 1936 was bad legislation to begin with. Now it is bad legislation which
is holding up the entire U.S. Senate. Again, we ask you to withdraw this bill
for the rest of the session. We are willing to work with you, with bill sponsors
and others to fashion meaningful, scientifically-defensible, and
politically-acceptable radioactive waste policy next term.</P>
<P>Sincerely,</P>

<P>NEWS FROM NIRS</P>
<P>Nuclear Information and Resource Service</P>
<P>1424 16th Street NW, #404, Washington DC 20036</P>

<P>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE </P>
<P>July 17, 1996 </P>
<H1>NIRS CALLS ON LOTT TO WITHDRAW NUCLEAR WASTE BILL;</H1>
<H1>WARNS ANY FURTHER &quot;GRIDLOCK&quot; WILL BE DUE TO DUMP PROPONENTS</H1>
<P>The Nuclear Information and Resource Service today called on Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott to withdraw further consideration of S. 1936, a bill that
would put an &quot;interim&quot; storage dump for high-level radioactive waste
in Nevada.</P>
<P>Citing a July 15, 1996 letter in which the Administration reaffirmed
President Clinton's intent to veto S. 1936, and a July 16 procedural Senate
floor vote in which opponents of the measure received the necessary 34 votes to
sustain a veto, NIRS said it is time for Lott &quot;to withdraw this bill for
the rest of the session.&quot;</P>
<P>Senators Reid and Bryan of Nevada have been leading a filibuster against S.
1936. The Senate voted July 16 65-34 in favor of invoking &quot;cloture&quot; on
a motion to proceed with S. 1936. Another &quot;cloture&quot; vote to end a
filibuster is expected next week. NIRS pointed out that several Senators who
voted for cloture, which merely allows consideration of the bill to proceed, are
likely to support a Presidential veto. &quot;The margin voting to sustain a veto
may be quite a bit larger than yesterday's vote indicates,&quot; Michael
Mariotte, NIRS' Executive Director, wrote in a July 17, 1996 letter to Lott.</P>
<P>The letter continued, &quot;Meanwhile, continuing with this unnecessary and
dangerous legislation will continue to delay Senate consideration of other
important policy matters and appropriations bills. The gridlock you criticized
last week likely will continue. Now, however, it is clear that it is the
supporters of S. 1936 who are causing the gridlock, by continuing to pursue a
bill which surely cannot be enacted.&quot;</P>
<P>In releasing the letter, Mariotte said, &quot;Senator Lott and the nuclear
power industry will be at fault for any further Senate gridlock, for bringing up
a bill which President Clinton has said, in writing, that he will veto. This is
not a partisan issue, it's a common sense issue. Common sense says you don't
move high-level radioactive waste across dangerous railways and highways unless
you have to. Common sense says you certainly don't move it unless you know where
it's going to end up permanently, and unless the utilities which generated it
are liable for any accidents. This bill defies common sense in order to give
nuclear utilities an election-year financial break.&quot;</P>
<P>Added Mary Olson of NIRS' Radioactive Waste Project, &quot;We commend
Senators Reid and Bryan, and President Clinton, for their efforts to ensure that
this bill is never enacted. They are protecting the American people from
dangerous nuclear waste transport, pure and simple. 50 million Americans live
within two miles of transport routes, in 43 states, on which lethal high-level
radioactive waste would be shipped under S. 1936. Without the Reid/Bryan
filibuster and the Presidential veto promise, Americans would soon see huge
radioactive waste transport casks--each carrying as much as 200 Hiroshima bombs
worth of long-lived radiation--traveling through their neighborhoods. This is
absolutely unacceptable and unconscionable, especially when the waste would be
moved to an uncertain future: to an &quot;interim&quot; dump on a geological
fault line.&quot;</P>
<P>The text of NIRS' July 17 letter to Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and
the Administration's July 15 veto promise are available on request, and from

<H2>S. 1936 (Mobile Chernobyl Act), Update #3</H2>
<P>July 17, 1996, 3 pm</P>
<P>Today, Wednesday, the Senate has temporarily shelved S. 1936 and is moving
on to other business. Now that Senators Reid and Bryan have proven they can get
34 votes, they have agreed to drop their filibuster efforts for the time being
and will let the Senate debate other bills.</P>
<P>Our best estimate now is that the key &quot;cloture&quot; vote (the vote to
cut off the Reid/Bryan filibuster on S. 1936) will take place next Wednesday or
Thursday (July 24 or 25). We will again need at least 34 votes on this effort to
remain credible. Indeed, it is possible we can get the full 40 votes needed to
win the cloture vote! This would almost certainly end any further consideration
of S. 1936 this year. All we need to do is hold on to those who voted with
Reid/Bryan the first time, and switch six more votes.</P>
<P>Given that President Clinton has reaffirmed in writing his intention to veto
this bill, switching six votes is certainly possible, if Senators perceive that
continuing with the bill is a waste of time. We need to keep building momentum,
and keep those calls, faxes, e-mails and letters coming in.</P>
<H2>TODAY'S ACTIONS:</H2>
<P><STRONG>Short-term:</STRONG> If you haven't called your Senators yet,
please do so. If your Senator voted with Reid/Bryan yesterday, please thank
him/her and encourage him/her to continue voting against S. 1936 and against any
cloture vote. If your Senator voted for cloture yesterday, point out that
Reid/Bryan got enough votes to sustain a veto, and that Clinton has promised a
veto. Any further consideration of this bill is a waste of the Senate's time,
and takes away from the Senate's duty to pass appropriations bills and consider
bills that might benefit the American people.</P>
<P>Continue reaching out to friends, contacting phone trees, other groups that
might be interested, local officials, etc. A lot of calls are reaching the
Senate--we must keep it up!</P>
<P>Note: please do not be afraid of calling your Senator more than once. While
it's a good idea not to be a pest, as circumstances change, Senators need to
hear your views. For example, now that the first vote has taken place, it is
perfectly appropriate to call Senators so far in support of S. 1936 and point
out that circumstances have changed, and not only should they not support the
bill, but neither should they further waste the Senate's time by encouraging
consideration of a bill that will be vetoed, and the veto sustained. </P>
<P>If your Senator(s) voted with Reid/Bryan, write a letter to the editor of a
local paper praising that vote. You might also consider praising Clinton for the
July 15 reaffirmation of his veto promise. He, Reid/Bryan, and all the Senators
who voted against cloture need to be commended for their efforts to protect
Americans from unsound radioactive waste dumping practices and for working to
block unnecessary and dangerous radioactive waste transportation through
hundreds of cities, towns, and America's agricultural heartland.</P>
<P><STRONG>Long-term:</STRONG> Go to your city and county councils and get
resolutions passed against S. 1936. There is still time to gain more political
support for our position, especially if the Senate goes ahead and votes for the
bill, and Clinton vetoes it. That process could take weeks. Resolutions passed
by other cities and counties (ranging in size from Los Angeles, Denver, &amp;
St. Louis to Mt. Rainier, MD, and Decatur, GA) are available from NIRS or from
our website (www.nirs.org). Gathering more political support is essential in
this election year.</P>
<P>In addition, there is still time to get new organizations to sign on to
letters to the Senate and White House against S. 1936. Unless we win the cloture
vote next Thursday, this could go on into September. Letters to the White House
are important so that Clinton realizes his position is supported.</P>
<P>Think about organizations which you might not yet have contacted. Has the
local chapter of Audobon sent a letter yet? How about the local chapter of
American Association of Retired People? Local Young Democrats Group? or
Americans for Democratic Action? How about the local Chamber of Commerce (esp.
in areas where resolutions have already passed?). Church congregations can often
be helpful. How about some of the contacts you made doing Chernobyl relief work?</P>
<P>We realize it's summer, and hot, and vacation time and everything else. But
this is crunch time--this period has been 2 years in the making; we either win
or lose now. The nuclear industry is running large ads in the Washington Post
almost every day. And you can bet they're getting in touch with their own &quot;grassroots&quot;
constituency: utility executive and nuclear plant workers. The nuclear industry
is not going to let up, and we can't either. BUT WE CAN WIN, and with your help
and work right now, WE WILL WIN!</P>

<H1>KEY VOTE, THURSDAY, JULY 25! CALL, FAX, E-MAIL YOUR SENATORS!</H1>
<P>S. 1936 (formerly S. 1271), the &quot;Mobile Chernobyl Act,&quot; is still
on the Senate floor. A key &quot;cloture&quot; vote is scheduled for Thursday,
July 25. A &quot;cloture&quot; vote is used to try to end a filibuster. Although
Nevada Senators Reid and Bryan have allowed the Senate to conduct other business
over the past week, they have maintained their filibuster over S. 1936,
preventing it from coming to a vote.</P>
<P>It takes 60 votes to reach &quot;cloture,&quot; i.e. to break the
filibuster. We lost the first cloture vote last week 65-34. Thus, we only need
to swing a few votes to win this one! Please call, fax &amp; e-mail your
Senators today. If they voted against cloture last week, thank them and ask them
to do so again. If they voted for cloture last week, ask them to change their
votes this time. You might point out that the 34 votes Reid/Bryan received last
week are enough to sustain a presidential veto, and President Clinton last week
reaffirmed his intention to veto S. 1936. Thus, continuing consideration of this
bill will result in more wasted time for the Senate (indeed, it is possible that
if we just gain 3 or 4 Senators, the bill will be withdrawn, unless its sponsors
actually want a presidential veto). All no-shows are counted in our favor.</P>
<P>If you don't know how your Senators voted last week, please check the NIRS
web site (www.nirs.org) and read S. 1936, update #1, or call NIRS at
202-328-0002.</P>
<P>Grassroots activity is essential now! The nuclear industry has spent at
least $100,000 on ads in Washington papers over the past 10 days. You can bet
they're sending a bevy of lobbyists up to Senate offices too. We don't have ad
money and we don't have a bunch of lobbyists either. What we have is you--and
your action can make the difference. WE CAN WIN THIS BATTLE!</P>
<P>CAPITOL SWITCHBOARD: 202-224-3121</P>
<P>Here is some background material on the Price-Anderson Act and nuclear waste
transport. Perhaps the most significant issue is that TAXPAYERS will pay for any
accident damages, not the nuclear industry which generated the waste, nor the
carrier transporting the waste. You may want to bring up this issue with your
Senator, few realize the extent of taxpayer liability.</P>
<P>If S 1936 passes, more than 50 million people in the U.S. will be at risk of
a high-level nuclear waste transport accident. The Department of Energy intends
to privatize the transport, while also indemnifying the carriers. In the event
of a significant accident, the tax payers will have to foot the bill.
Involuntary risk coupled with financial liability for the hazard is a bad deal
for the people of the U.S.</P>
<P>The Department of Energy projects that more than 50 million people live
within 2 miles of the rail routes that would carry high-level nuclear waste to a
waste site in Nevada. This does not include those who live along the projected
truck corridors.</P>
<P>The rates of accidents for the transport industry indicate that one can
expect 15 accidents a year at a minimum. Department of Energy staff acknowledge
that they project 2--5 accidents with significant release of radioactivity
during the span of the program.</P>
<P>S. 1936 states that the Department of Energy takes title and ownership of
the irradiated fuel when the fuel is accepted at the reactor sites, thus the
shipments will be DOE shipments.</P>
<P>July 9, 1996, the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management met with
prospective bidders for contracts to operate the OCRWM's transport system
(either to a congressionally mandated interim storage site, or to a repository).
Attendees were informed that the contractors would be indemnified for all
transportation accidents involving the release of radioactive materials and
liability associated with some emergency evacuations.</P>
<P>Indemnification would be pursuant to the Price-Anderson Act, which provides
up to $ 8.96 billion. Since the liability would pertain to a DOE shipment, the
fund which would pay these costs resulting from this indemnification would be
the U.S. Treasury General Fund--in other words, taxpayer dollars.</P>
<P>This differs from the Price Anderson coverage available in the case of a
reactor commercial reactor accident, where the payments come from the utility's
insurance, to the limit of coverage, and then from a pool that all the nuclear
utilities pay into.</P>
<P>OCRWM also informed prospective bidders that they must be self insured or
provide suitable liability insurance for all operating situations not covered by
the Price-Anderson Act.</P>
<P>The user-funded Nuclear Waste Fund, is intended to pay the cost of the
government operated commercial nuclear fuel management and disposal program.
However, under the Price-Anderson Act, since the transportation contractor will
accept title on behalf of the Department of Energy,  at the commercial reactor
sites, financial liability for incidents involving radiation release and Nuclear
Regulatory Commission approved evacuations will then shift to the federal
government's General Fund, rather than being underwritten by the Nuclear Waste
Fund.</P>
<P>Given the magnitude and expected 30 to 40 year duration of the planned
shipping campaign, even OCRWM predicts that there could be a few accidents where
radiation would be released. The potentially enormous liability for each such
incident would fall on the taxpayers of the nation rather than the ratepayers
originally benefited from the nuclear power. Nuclear ratepayers were intended to
bear all the costs of the waste generated and the management and disposal
system.</P>
<P>Privatizing the nuclear waste transport system, while at the same time
removing any liability for accidents places the incentives in the wrong place.
The U.S. population should not have to pay for disastrous consequences from a
risky activity that affects them without their consent. If title remains with
the generator during transport to the point of destination, then there is more
incentive to insure that the transport will be done as carefully as possible.
This is the ultimate in privatization of nuclear waste handling.</P>
<P>Mary Olson</P>
<P>Nuclear Information &amp; Resource Service (202)328-0002</P>
<P>7/11/96</P>
<P>Note: OCRWM has removed any expectation that there will be any preference
for rail shipments. Previous projections of the distribution of truck vs. rail
transport of high-level waste assumed that rail would be used wherever possible.
(Some reactors do not have the physical capacity to lead a larger rail cask, so
truck cask would have to be used.)</P>
<P>A rail cask holds about 5 times more fuel assemblies than a truck cask. If
OCRWM transportation service contractors instead selected truck for any reason,
this will increase the number of shipments and also impact the projections on
which areas will be most heavily affected by shipments. For instance, in
Indiana, there could be an even greater impact on Indianapolis, over and above
the 1080 casks already projected to pass through the I-70 corridor.</P>

<P>S. 1936 Update #5</P>
<P>July 24, 1996</P>
<H1>Vote on S. 1936 postponed again.</H1>
<P>The cloture vote on the filibuster against S. 1936, scheduled for Thursday,
July 25, has been cancelled. Senators Reid and Bryan of Nevada have agreed to
stop their filibuster against S. 1936, in return for another delay on the final
vote. The final vote on S. 1936 will occur next Wednesday, July 31. THIS WILL BE
A VOTE ON THE BILL ITSELF!</P>
<P>We will not win this vote, but it is essential that we receive at least 34
votes against the bill, more if possible. This will indicate enough votes to
sustain the veto President Clinton has promised.</P>
<P>WHAT YOU CAN DO: We've said it before, we'll say it again: call, fax &amp;
e-mail your Senators (note, you can again e-mail Senators directly from NIRS web
site). If you haven't yet asked your friends, colleagues, neighbors, etc. to
call, there is time, please do so now.</P>
<P>Capitol Switchboard: 202-224-3121</P>
<P>In addition, it is time to call, fax &amp; e-mail the White House, thank
President Clinton for his veto promise and encourage him to follow through with
it.</P>
<P>White House: 202-456-1111; fax: 202-456-2461; e-mail:
president@whitehouse.gov</P>
<P>Finally, we do not expect the House of Representatives to act on this issue
before the August recess, although IT IS POSSIBLE. The nuclear industry lobby is
pushing the House to act as quickly as possible. The House can do one of two
things: they can either take up their own Mobile Chernobyl Act, HR 1020, or if
the House sponsors want to avoid a conference committee, they can take up the
Senate bill as passed. We do not at this point know which route they will take.</P>
<P>Please call your House member this week as well (also at the Capitol
Switchboard number above), and urge a vote against HR 1020 and any other &quot;interim&quot;
storage legislation.</P>
<P>Don't forget that Congress will recess August 3 and will not return until
after Labor Day. Your Congressmembers will be home in your areas campaigning.
Try to meet with them and express your opposition to HR 1020 in person. Also,
you may want to contact your Member's opponent and find out his/her stand on
this issue, and whether it could become an issue in the election campaign.</P>
<P>In a related matter, a DC Circuit Court of Appeals yesterday issued a
decision in a case brought by several utilities and state agencies. This
decision says that the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 and contracts signed by
DOE require DOE to take utility radioactive waste by January 31, 1998 or face
unspecified penalties.</P>
<P>The nuclear industry will be sure to use this decision as another reason
Congressmembers should vote for S. 1936 or HR 1020. HOWEVER, there are several
points you can make: 1) the decision does NOT say that an &quot;interim&quot;
dump must be built by 1998, nor even that an &quot;interim&quot; dump must be
built at all; 2) it does not say that an interim dump must be built in Nevada
(which actually would be against the law under the 1982 Act and Amendments); 3)
it does not say that legislation allowing an &quot;interim&quot; dump must
trample on nearly every major environmental law in the country, including NEPA,
Clean Air Act, Safe Drinking Water Act, etc.; 4) it does not say that the EPA
should be forbidden from establishing radiation standards from an &quot;interim&quot;
dump, nor from a permanent dump, for that matter, 5) it does not say legislation
should pre-empt state authority; and so forth..</P>
<P>Further, the decision exacerbates what has been a central problem in U.S.
radioactive waste policy decades: rather than understanding the difficult
science of radioactive waste storage, it relies on an arbitrary factor--the
January 31, 1998 date, that Congressmembers in 1982 thought would be a
reasonable time to expect construction of a permanent waste dump to be
completed. As we all know now, 1998 wasn't even close to reasonable.
Constructing radioactive waste policy by date, rather than by science, is simply
illogical and can only lead to bad policy.</P>
<P>We will have more on this decision in the next Nuclear Monitor.</P>

<BODY>
<H1>DON'T WASTE AMERICA! </H1> 
<P>The United States Congress is preparing to change the nation's
radioactive waste laws. Unfortunately, Congress seems ready to reduce
public safety and environmental protection, and instead--at the behest
of the nuclear power industry--wants to speed construction of new
radioactive waste dumps. But radioactive waste cannot be
&quot;disposed&quot;: of, and new, unscientific dumping could lead to
severe radiation leaks, or worse. Indeed, instituting unsound
radioactive waste practices could lead to a new generation of nuclear
reactors and an even greater problem.
</P><P>Help stop the waste dumpers and the nuclear power industry.
There are several basic principles for sound radioactive waste
management. Any legislation should incorporate these principles. <B>Congress:
Don't let the nuclear industry waste America!</B> 
</P><P>We demand: 1. An end to generation of long-lasting radioactive
waste. It is impossible to consider establishing new radioactive waste
dumps while generation continues--which would require even more
radioactive waste dumps.
</P><P>2. No utility should have access to a radioactive waste dump
unless it has stopped generating radioactive waste.
</P><P>3. Radioactive waste transportation should be avoided where
possible.
</P><P>4. All radioactive waste must be isolated from the environment
in an accessible, retrievable manner, be constantly monitored for leaks,
and be recontainerized to prevent leaks. Our policy must be zero release
of radiation.
</P><P>5. Liability must remain with waste generators, not taxpayers.

<P>April 16, 1996</P>
<P>Hon. Robert Dole Majority Leader United States Senate Washington, DC 20510</P>
<P>Dear Majority Leader Dole:</P>
<P>We are dismayed and outraged to learn that a Senate floor vote on S. 1271
(Craig, R-Idaho) tentatively has been scheduled for April 25 or 26, 1996.</P>
<P>As you know, April 26, 1996 is the tenth anniversary of the Chernobyl
nuclear accident--a disaster whose consequences have grown larger with time. It
is an anniversary that merits sober reflection on the terrible consequences of
the nuclear age, and respect for the tens of thousands of people who have lost
their homes, their land, and their lives.</P>
<P>Instead, we apparently will be treated to the spectacle of a Senate vote on
the U.S. nuclear power industry's latest &quot;not-in-my-back-yard&quot;
scheme--a bill which has been quite aptly dubbed the &quot;Mobile Chernobyl Act.&quot;</P>
<P>S. 1271 addresses the ongoing and enormous problem of radioactive waste by
moving the problem from the nuclear utilities to taxpayers. The bill would
establish an &quot;interim&quot; radioactive waste storage site near Yucca
Mountain, Nevada, and begin the unprecedented transport of high-level
radioactive waste through 43 states and the District of Columbia; through</P>
<P>dozens of cities and across our nation's agricultural heartland. Once the
waste left the utility sites, where it is now, title to and liability for that
waste would transfer from the utilities to the taxpayers. All this because
nuclear utilities don't want to pay for storage of their own waste, and, like
everyone else, don't want it in their own backyards.</P>
<P>S. 1271 would be an insult to the American people at any time. Holding this
vote on the 10th anniversary of Chernobyl is contemptuous and demonstrates a
serious lack of understanding of the lessons of Chernobyl.</P>
<P>Writing in the April 1996 issue of Scientific American, Yuri Shcherbak,
Ukraine's Ambassador to the United States, said, &quot;Chornobyl [Ukrainian
spelling] was not simply another disaster of the sort that humankind has
experienced throughout history, like a fire or an earthquake or a flood. It is a
global environmental event of a new kind. It is characterized by the presence of
thousands of environmental refugees; long-term contamination of land, water and
air; and possibly irreparable damage to ecosystems. Chornobyl demonstrates the
ever growing threat of technology run amok.&quot;</P>
<P>S. 1271 ignores the lessons of Chernobyl. The high-level nuclear waste that
would be transported across our nation's railways and highways contains 95% of
the radioactivity ever created in the U.S. Before we begin such a risky
endeavor, we had better be sure that the first transport of this deadly material
is the last. Moving the waste to an &quot;interim&quot; site, even as evidence
is growing that Yucca Mountain is not suitable for permanent disposal, could be
a catastrophic mistake.</P>
<P>We must avoid a Mobile Chernobyl in the United States. The best way to do
that is to not rush into nuclear industry schemes to avoid liability for their
own waste products.</P>
<P>A fitting commemoration of Chernobyl's 10th anniversary would be for you to
announce that S. 1271 will never reach the Senate floor.</P>

<P>EIGHTY-THREE ORGANIZATIONS BLAST DOLE FOR SCHEDULING VOTE ON &quot;MOBILE
CHERNOBYL ACT&quot; ON 10TH ANNIVERSARY OF CHERNOBYL DISASTER</P>
<P>Eighty-three national, regional and local organizations today expressed &quot;dismay
and outrage&quot; that Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole has scheduled a vote on
S. 1271, dubbed the &quot;Mobile Chernobyl Act,&quot; to coincide with the tenth
anniversary of the world's worst environmental disaster. A letter from the
groups, which represent millions of Americans, was hand-delivered to Dole today,
along with about 30,000 petition signatures to Dole saying &quot;Don't Waste
America.&quot;</P>
<P>According to the Senate calendar, Dole, who schedules Senate floor votes,
has slated S. 1271 for a vote on April 25 or 26. The Chernobyl nuclear accident
occurred April 26, 1986.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>&quot;On April 26, people across the world will be mourning the
Chernobyl accident, the tens of thousands who already have died, and the
millions who still live on contaminated land and eat contaminated food,&quot;
said Michael Mariotte, executive director of the Nuclear Information and
Resource Service (NIRS), which is coordinating a national relief effort for
Chernobyl victims. &quot;We cannot imagine a more inappropriate time for a vote
on a bill which brings the threat of a Chernobyl-style accident to 43 states,
countless cities and towns, and our nation's agricultural heartland. More than
50 million Americans live within one mile of the likely transport routes.
Surely, if Bob Dole has any compassion, he will reschedule this vote; better
yet, he will ensure this unconscionable bill never reaches the Senate floor.&quot;</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>S. 1271 would establish an &quot;interim&quot; storage site for high-level
radioactive waste near Yucca Mountain, Nevada, which is currently undergoing
characterization to determine its suitability as a permanent radioactive waste
dump. According to Department of Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary, the site has
only a 50-50 chance of ever receiving a license to become a nuclear waste
repository.</P>
<P>If S. 1271 is enacted, transportation of this high-level nuclear
waste--which contains 95% of all the radioactivity ever created in the United
States--would begin as early as 1998. The bill is supported by nuclear utilities
because, once the waste leaves their property, title to and liability for the
waste would revert to taxpayers instead of the utilities which generated it.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>&quot;Nuclear utilities are the biggest NIMBYs (not in my back
yard) of all,&quot; said Mary Olson of NIRS' Radioactive Waste Project. &quot;Rather
than address the problem they created, or find acceptable storage methods for
their lethal garbage, they want to make all Americans liable for their mistakes.&quot;</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Under the bill, radioactive waste would be transported in huge casks, called
&quot;multi-purpose canisters.&quot; These casks would travel predominately by
rail, but also on highways, to Nevada, where they would be placed in a parking
lot setting awaiting further disposition, perhaps for decades. The largest of
the casks, which would travel by rail, would contain some 200 Hiroshima bombs
worth of long-lived radiation. In the past two months, there have been several
notable train accidents--five of which have occurred on likely rail
transportation routes. An accident in Silver Spring, Maryland, for example, just
outside the nation's capitol, reflected a scenario for a major radiation
release: a head-on collision involving substantial fire. That track is a likely
radioactive waste transport route.</P>
<P>The bill would also open the door for reprocessing of nuclear waste, which
poses severe environmental and proliferation threats.</P>
<P>Senator Richard Bryan (D-Nev.) intends to lead a filibuster against the bill
should it reach the Senate floor. President Clinton has said he will veto the
bill in its current form.</P>
<P>A public opinion poll conducted in December 1995 found that 70% of the
American people prefer the major alternative: establishing an independent
commission to re-evaluate our nation's radioactive waste policies before moving
any nuclear waste. Only 26% favored the immediate transport of waste required by
S. 1271.</P>
<P>Though he has scheduled a vote, Senator Dole has not publicly expressed an
opinion on merits of the bill. Similar legislation in the House, HR 1020, has
some 200 co-sponsors, but has stalled due to concerns by some House members over
that bill's deficit-increasing provisions. Negotiations are reportedly underway
behind-the-scenes to address the bill's budgetary problems.</P>
<P>The Senate Energy Committee approved S. 1271 March 13 by a 12-6 vote, with
two abstentions. All committee Democrats, except Howell Heflin (Ala.), either
voted against the bill or abstained. The House Commerce Committee approved HR
1020 last summer by a 30-4 vote. The bills are the nuclear power industry's
major legislative goal this Congress and, the industry believes, are a
prerequisite to the construction of new nuclear reactors in the U.S.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>&quot;The &quot;Mobile Chernobyl Act&quot; is a last-ditch
effort by a desperate, failed industry to transfer its financial burden from
nuclear utilities to taxpaying citizens,&quot; said Mariotte. &quot;The bill is
an insult to the American people and, by scheduling its vote on Chernobyl day,
Senator Dole has managed to offend all the world's citizens who are taking this
time to remember their loved ones and to reflect upon the dangers of a nuclear
technology gone amok.&quot;</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>According to an article by Yuri Scherhbak, an epidemiologist and Ukraine's
Ambassador to the United States, in the April 1996 Scientific American, some
30,000 people already have died as a result of Chernobyl, and millions of lives
have been disrupted permanently .</P>

<H4><STRONG>SUPPORT AN INDEPENDENT REVIEW OF RADIOACTIVE WASTE
POLICY</STRONG></H4>

<P>
November 8, 1995
<P>
Dear Representative:
<P>
We are writing to urge your opposition to H.R. 1020, the Nuclear
Waste
<P>
Policy Act of 1995. This ill-conceived piece of legislation cleared
<P>
the Commerce Committee in August and is likely to come before
the full
<P>
House shortly. Instead, please support legislation to create an
<P>
independent commission to conduct a comprehensive review of the
<P>
nation's nuclear waste policy.
<P>
As a diverse collection of groups with a variety of constituencies
and
<P>
interests, we have differing views on the wisdom of nuclear power
and
<P>
the best means to cope with the highly toxic, long-lived wastes
<P>
generated by commercial and defense-related nuclear activities.
H.R.
<P>
1020, however, contains provisions that offend a common principle.
We
<P>
believe that the nation's nuclear waste policy should have a
<P>
fundamental focus on the protection of public health and safety.
The
<P>
bill discards this simple priority in favor of the desires of
nuclear
<P>
utilities. H.R. 1020 would ignore the need for strong health and
<P>
environmental protections, full public participation, and sensitivity
<P>
to issues of environmental justice to create a program that slashes
<P>
standards and uses unreasonable timetables to force an unwilling
host
<P>
to accept an unnecessary nuclear waste facility and an entire
nation
<P>
to bear the risks of the largest nuclear waste transportation
<P>
enterprise in history.
<P>
The Department of Energy (DOE) is currently conducting tests at
Yucca
<P>
Mountain in Nevada to determine whether the site is suitable to
host a
<P>
repository for the nation's high-level nuclear waste. These activities
<P>
are directed by the 1982 Nuclear Waste Policy Act (NWPA) and its
1987
<P>
amendments, which named, over vigorous Nevada objections, Yucca
<P>
Mountain as the only candidate for a permanent repository. While
the
<P>
NWPA allows the construction of an interim storage facility for
<P>
nuclear waste, the state of Nevada may not be the host. This
<P>
prohibition is essential to ensuring the credibility of site
<P>
suitability studies at Yucca Mountain.
<P>
The NWPA envisioned a repository by 1998. Because the earliest
<P>
possible opening date has slipped to 2010, the nuclear industry,
faced
<P>
with a public relations problem as waste accumulates at reactors,
is
<P>
pressing the government to create an &quot;interim&quot; storage
facility to
<P>
accept waste in 1998. H.R. 1020 would override current restrictions
<P>
and force placement of the facility near Yucca Mountain in 1998.
<P>
Regardless of one's opinion of the wisdom of either a repository
or an
<P>
interim storage facility, any policy to implement either idea
must be
<P>
characterized by honest scientific studies and high standards
for
<P>
public health and safety. H.R. 1020 is woefully lacking in both
<P>
respects.
<P>
The DOE will decide whether Yucca Mountain is a technically suitable
<P>
repository site in 1998. Several outstanding scientific and technical
<P>
issues remain to be addressed before this determination is made,
yet
<P>
H.R. 1020 would mandate that an interim facility be operational
near
<P>
Yucca Mountain in 1998. There is no technical reason to place
such a
<P>
facility in Nevada. Indeed, with most reactors east of the Mississippi
<P>
River, Nevada is an odd location for &quot;temporary&quot; storage.
Placing an
<P>
interim facility there only makes sense if a repository is to
be
<P>
located at Yucca Mountain. Doing so before a determination is
made on
<P>
Yucca Mountain's suitability as a repository would cast serious
doubt
<P>
on the study's integrity.
<P>
H.R. 1020 would also gut environmental and public safety standards.
<P>
For example, the legislation would prohibit the Environmental
<P>
Protection Agency from issuing radiation release standards for
the
<P>
repository, as current law directs, and would instead set a lax
<P>
exposure standard associated with one excess cancer death for
every
<P>
285 individuals exposed over a lifetime. Other provisions attempt
to
<P>
ignore potential problems that could arise over a repository's
<P>
10,000-year regulatory life. In issuing a repository license,
for
<P>
example, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is directed to
assume
<P>
that no human intrusion shall ever occur upon the repository.
<P>
Considering the vast changes seen in the last century, let alone
the
<P>
last 10,000 years, evading consideration of such a potentially
<P>
dangerous problem is dubious policy. In fact the 10,000-year standard
<P>
is already weak since much of the radioactive waste will remain
toxic
<P>
for hundreds of thousands of years.
<P>
Licensing the interim facility would be even easier. H.R. 1020
would
<P>
allow the DOE to commence interim storage construction simply
by
<P>
submitting a license application. To further ease construction,
the
<P>
legislation exempts site selection, license application, and
<P>
construction from the Environmental Impact Statement that would
be
<P>
required by the National Environmental Policy Act. While the NRC
can
<P>
halt construction, it need not approve it.
<P>
Another serious shortcoming of H.R. 1020 is its use of deadlines,
<P>
which places decisions that should be subject to debate, planning,
and
<P>
study on arbitrary timetables. While beneficial for the nuclear
<P>
industry, reliance on unforgiving deadlines is not rational policy
in
<P>
service of public health or safety.
<P>
The deadline-driven policymaking of H.R. 1020 would also imperil
<P>
citizen participation in nuclear waste decisions. The NRC has
<P>
testified that it would be unable to license an interim storage
<P>
facility in the 16 months demanded by the legislation and still
allow
<P>
a public hearing for the process.
<P>
H.R. 1020's deadlines would exacerbate the risks of the bill's
most
<P>
far-reaching short-term impact -- the largest nuclear waste
<P>
transportation enterprise in history. Nuclear utilities have already
<P>
discharged approximately 30,000 metric tons of irradiated fuel,
<P>
containing over 95 percent of the nation's waste radioactivity.
By the
<P>
year 2030, the tonnage will rise to over 80,000. Serious safety
issues
<P>
require consideration before embarking on a plan to transport
so much
<P>
of so deadly a material to a remote location.
<P>
First of all, current safety standards fail to incorporate the
full
<P>
range of trauma to which a cask of radioactive fuel may be exposed
in
<P>
an accident. Heat standards, for example, are below the temperature
at
<P>
which diesel fuel burns. Worst of all, regulations do not even
require
<P>
testing of full-scale models to ensure compliance. In combination
with
<P>
an increased number of accidents, resulting from the high number
of
<P>
shipments and the long journeys to Nevada from eastern reactors,
these
<P>
regulatory shortcomings will create significant risks for millions
of
<P>
Americans. Few communities are currently equipped to respond to
the
<P>
challenges presented by a nuclear waste transport accident.
<P>
We are also concerned that the risks of transportation are not
<P>
equitably distributed. Nevada, for example, has no nuclear plants
and
<P>
derives no benefit from nuclear power. Furthermore, as host of
<P>
numerous atomic tests during the Cold War era that contaminated
the
<P>
air with fallout and left a considerable amount of waste in need
of
<P>
cleanup, the state has certainly borne more than its fair share
of the
<P>
atomic age's burdens already.
<P>
Nevada, while being asked to make the greatest sacrifice, would
hardly
<P>
be alone in feeling the effects of H.R. 1020. Forty-two other
states,
<P>
several of which are also without commercial nuclear reactors,
are
<P>
likely to bear the impact of transportation of high-level waste
to
<P>
Nevada.
<P>
Many of the expected transportation routes run through or near
urban
<P>
and impoverished areas that are already disproportionately subject
to
<P>
environmental risk from various polluting activities. Those along
the
<P>
routes will bear more than the risk of accidents. Even routine
<P>
transportation of high-level waste causes radiation exposure to
those
<P>
close to the casks. While the actual levels may be considered
low,
<P>
large populations will bear the attendant risk, magnifying the
impact.
<P>
H.R. 1020 would jeopardize public health and safety for no reason
<P>
other than to appear to &quot;solve&quot; a vexing public relations
problem for
<P>
nuclear utilities. Meanwhile, American taxpayers will assume a
large
<P>
financial liability for the nuclear waste. The interim facility
<P>
envisioned by H.R. 1020 will do nothing to curtail risks for residents
<P>
of areas surrounding operating nuclear power plants, as every
reactor
<P>
will necessarily remain a high-level waste site so long as it
<P>
continues to split atoms.
<P>
Instead of the quick-fix mentality predominant in this bill, we
need a
<P>
scientifically sound approach to the problem of radioactive waste.
The
<P>
nation's waste dilemma extends beyond the uncertainties surrounding
<P>
the Yucca Mountain program. Irrational classifications, unrealistic
<P>
deadlines, and insensitivity to public concerns have also complicated
<P>
efforts to address the accumulation of low-level and defense-related
<P>
radioactive wastes. For this reason, we urge you to support a
<P>
comprehensive independent review of the nation's radioactive waste
<P>
policy. The nation has never engaged in such a review. Since the
<P>
passage of the original Nuclear Waste Policy Act, much has been
<P>
learned about the challenges posed by all aspects of radioactive
waste
<P>
disposal. Conducting a review now offers the best opportunity
to apply
<P>
the lessons of the past decade to the question of which disposal
or
<P>
storage options to pursue in coming years. Fortunately, there
is time
<P>
to conduct a thorough review. NRC policy states that irradiated
<P>
nuclear fuel may remain safely at reactor sites for up to 100
years.
<P>
In opposing H.R. 1020, we are not expressing a consensus opinion
<P>
against ever centralizing storage of nuclear waste. Our concern
is
<P>
rather with the timing, motives, and potential consequences of
the
<P>
effort embodied by the bill. Rushing to pass H.R. 1020 would subject
<P>
millions of Americans to needless risk. In contrast, an independent
<P>
review offers the best chance to develop a coherent radioactive
waste
<P>
policy that unites sound science and public participation to protect
<P>
the health and safety of all Americans.

Statement of Michael Mariotte
<P>
Executive Director
<P>
January 18, 1996
<P>
We agree with one precept of the sponsors of HR 1020: our
<P>
nation's radioactive waste policies are not working.
<P>
But HR 1020 does not provide answers; indeed it does not even
<P>
address the right questions. More than 150 organizations,
<P>
numerous legislators, and the American public have called for
a
<P>
fresh look at our nation's radioactive waste policy. Rather than
<P>
embark on costly and dangerous band-aid fixes, we need to
<P>
implement a blue-ribbon, truly independent commission to
<P>
re-examine all of our nuclear waste programs from the ground up.
<P>
Such a commission could and should address issues such as the
<P>
classification of radioactive wastes, issues of cost and
<P>
liability, how to develop coherent programs to cover both
<P>
commercial and defense-related waste, and much more.
<P>
Meanwhile, grassroots America is continuing to display its
<P>
opposition to HR 1020 and to the unnecessary transportation of
<P>
radioactive waste. NIRS already has collected more than 25,000
<P>
Don't Waste America petitions against nuclear waste
<P>
transportation, and nuclear waste generation. Some 15,000 Don't
<P>
Waste America postcards have been mailed to members of Congress
<P>
by local citizens.
<P>
And a small, but growing number of local governments have
<P>
adopted resolutions or taken other action against HR 1020 and
<P>
waste transportation. These include Philadelphia, Bucks and
<P>
Bedford Counties, PA, as well as Bensalem, Bristol and Falls
<P>
Townships; Mt. Rainier, Greenbelt, and Takoma Park, MD; Decatur,
<P>
GA; Marshall and Anson Counties, NC, and several nearby towns;
<P>
Amherst, MA, and other nearby towns; Santa Barbara and Ventura
<P>
County, CA.
<P>
One year ago yesterday, at 102 press conferences across the
<P>
country, we released a study showing likely radioactive waste
<P>
transportation routes if a parking lot in Nevada was designated
<P>
as a storage site. At the time, predictions were that &quot;interim&quot;
<P>
storage legislation would pass rapidly through Congress. Now,
it
<P>
appears increasingly unlikely that HR 1020 and its companion
<P>
legislation can be enacted, nor that it would be signed by the
<P>
President.
<P>
We therefore ask the sponsors and co-sponsors of HR 1020, and
S
<P>
1271, to seek the right answers and to join with us in a united
<P>
call for formation of an independent blue-ribbon commission to
<P>
fully review our nation's nuclear waste policies.

</P><P></P><P><B>Statement of Mary Olson, Radioactive Waste Project</B>

</P><P>National Press Club, October 17, 1995
</P><P></P><P>When you ask people in Oklahoma why they are fighting
the bills in Congress that would send hundreds of high-level nuclear
waste shipments through their communities, they respond: &quot;Because
we are not crazy.&quot; If these bills become law, it will launch the
most intensely radioactive, deadly wastes of the nuclear age into motion
for the next 30 years. Three decades, minimum, with continuous shipping,
to move the irradiated fuel away from the nuclear power reactors that
make it, all the way to Yucca Mountain, NV. In the first year as much
high-level waste will be moved as the total that has ever been shipped
to date, in the U.S.
</P><P>I have spent the last few days finding &quot;handles&quot; --
ways to talk about this unfathomable material and the scope of this
project. Here are a few comparisons:
</P><P>The total amount of radioactivity that the nuclear industry
wants to put on our highways and rails is in excess of 30 billion
curies. Of this, the intensely radioactive cesium alone is 2 million
times more than the amount of cesium released by the bomb that destroyed
Hiroshima. Each large rail cask will hold the cesium equivalent of 200
Hiroshima bombs.
</P><P>The average rail cask will carry 174 lbs of plutonium. The total
waste payload of 85,000 metric tonnes, will include 1,800,000 pounds of
plutonium...Just the plutonium 239-- a fraction of the total plutonium--
will be more than 120 times the total amount of plutonium 239 released
by ALL the below-ground nuclear weapons tests, worldwide. These numbers
do not include the DOE wastes, nuclear navy wastes or foreign fuel
wastes that will also be moved if an &quot;interim&quot; storage site is
approved.
</P><P>The cancer potential of plutonium is well known. A single pound,
if distributed across the world's population, to the lung, could cause
global cancer. Probably equally unlikely is the environmental release of
all the plutonium 239 in these shipments. However, if it did find its
way into the pathways of the environment, a conservative estimate would
be 1.5 million cancers from this one element. ALL the elements making up
the 85,000 metric tonne total are carcinogenic. The cancer load from the
<B>total</B> is probably sufficient to give cancer to as many people as
have lived on Earth in the last 6000 years. These are &quot;handles&quot;
to think about, not assertions of what will happen.
</P><P>So the folks from Oklahoma say, &quot;We're not crazy.&quot;
They are not unique. S 1271, HR 1020, and the back room deals on
Appropriations Bills are opposed by reactor communities and targeted
dump communities alike. Over time those concerned with nuclear waste
have come to realize that we share the same &quot;backyard.&quot; August
27, 1994, proclaimed as National Radioactive Waste Day marked a clear
determination of affected communities to work together. We dropped all
misleading distinctions of the classification or source of radioactive
waste. We recognized that this is one big problem, and we reached out to
become one big community.
</P><P>Those concerned about the Northern States Power nuclear waste
piling up on the Dakota community on Prairie Island in Minnesota realize
that it is no solution to ship the waste to Yucca Mountain on Western
Shoshone Nation lands within Nevada. Yucca Mountain is known to have
geologic flaws and will not isolate the waste from the environment. It
should be disqualified as a site. We must recommit ourselves to science
as the basis of our waste program, not politics. Further, shipping will
only accommodate continued nuclear waste production on Prairie Island,
resulting in similar amounts of irradiated fuel on the reactor site in a
decade. Only about 1/3 of the projected total of 85,000 metric tonnes of
irradiated fuel exist today.
</P><P>It is also clear that the proposed legislation would just spread
the problem around. Instead of reducing the number of waste sites, it
would simply add one more, and all of the communities on the route will
be affected. This deadly waste would travel through the &quot;front yard&quot;
of thousands of communities in 43 states, including 3/4 of the U.S.
population! Communities are organizing to oppose the proposed
legislation. City Councils have taken action including: Mount Rainier
and Takoma Park, MD, Philadelphia and Bucks County, PA, Santa Barbara,
CA and Decatur, GA. Resolutions are springing up in many small towns as
well
</P><P>Citizens want what the nuclear industry promised all along: our
health, our safety and containment and isolation of radioactivity from
the environment and all life, for as long as it is hazardous. Moving the
waste, in haste, to a temporary facility at a site which should be
rejected from consideration as a permanent site, will not accomplish any
of these goals.
</P><P>Just as affected communities are determined to work together on
all types of radioactive waste -- so called &quot;low-level,&quot;
military, (from both DOE and DOD) and irradiated fuel, any effective
approach to a &quot;solution&quot; must also assess all types of
radioactive waste. This effort must be within the context of one single
affected community, and responsible to that community. It is no longer
acceptable to create false factions to serve nuclear industry interests
over public welfare.
</P><P>Thus we are calling for something that has not been done before.
An independent assessment by a panel that is controlled by those who are
not vested (financial or otherwise) in radioactive waste production.
This review needs to look at ALL radioactive waste programs, policies,
and the waste classification structure itself. It will not be possible
to grapple with the problems facing us in a rational manner until we
have fully defined what the problem is, the scope of it and bounded the
equation. A huge coalition of environmental and public interest
organizations, the U.S. General Accounting Office, the Nuclear Waste
Technical Review Board, local, state and federal elected officials, have
called for such an independent review. Senator Bryan's bill S. 544,
would establish a Commission to do this job. We support it fully.

</P><P></P><H1>Questions and Answers: High-Level Nuclear Waste
Shipments
</H1> 
<H3>What is in a high-level nuclear waste cask?</H3> 
<H5>Irradiated fuel from commercial nuclear utility operation of
nuclear power reactors. Three years inside the reactor core makes the
fuel over a million times more radioactive than unused fuel. The
total--the Department of Energy projects 85,000 metric tonnes by the
time the existing reactors close--contains 95% of all of the
radioactivity of the Nuclear Age. The shipping program and the Bills in
Congress that would authorize it, will transfer the liability for this
waste from the nuclear utilities to the US taxpayer. It will take thirty
years, or more, of continuous shipping to move the fuel from reactor
sites to Nevada. The first year and each year after, more irradiated
fuel will move than all the shipments of this material to date. Today,
only about 35% of the projected 85,000 metric tonnes has been generated.
</H5> 
<H3>How dangerous is this stuff?</H3> 
<H5>Unshielded, irradiated reactor fuel that has been stored for 10
years will deliver a lethal dose to anyone within a meter in less than
three minutes. Radiation, even lethal levels, cannot be detected by
human senses. Splitting uranium atoms releases heat that is used to make
electricity, it also increases radioactivity. The broken pieces of
uranium atoms are lighter elements called fission products. These
include strontium-90, cobalt-60 and cesium-137, all sources of intensely
penetrating radiation. Cesium is chemically similar to potassium. If
released to the environment, it concentrates in the muscle and gonads in
the body, as well as in cow's and mother's milk. Cesium can be
concentrated by the food chain. Humans, being at the top of the food
chain, may receive an ingested dose of cesium thousands of times higher
than the concentration in the immediate environment. The intense gamma
radiation of fission products is an immediate danger to those exposed in
an accident. A large rail cask holds as much cesium as would be released
by 200 Hiroshima bombs. The total shipping program will move almost 2
million times more cesium than was released at Hiroshima.<B></B>Cesium
is just a fraction of the radioactivity in the shipping casks and in the
bomb that destroyed Hiroshima August 6, 1945.
</H5> 
<H3>What about long term impacts?</H3> 
<H5>Each cask contains radioactive elements like plutonium that will
persist if released to the environment for hundreds of thousands of
years. An average rail cask will carry about 174 pounds of plutonium. A
total of almost 2 million pounds of plutonium will be mobilized on the
roads and rails nationally. Plutonium is well-known as a carcinogen. For
reference, a single pound of plutonium could cause cancer in every
person alive today, if it were divided and deposited in the lung tissue.
If instead, all 2 million pounds of plutonium were released to the
environment, (lowering the dose), there would be at least 1,500,000
fatal cancers from plutonium 239 alone. There would also be many
non-fatal cancers as well as a host of non-cancer effects, genetic
effects, sterility and other human suffering. Other species would also
be affected. The total plutonium 239 in the shipping campaign is 128
times more than the total released to the environment by below-ground
weapons tests, worldwide. </H5> 
<H3>Is there radiation risk, even if there is no accident in my
community?</H3> 
<H5>Yes. Federal regulation allows radiation to penetrate the shielding
of the transport cask at a rate up to 10 millirems an hour measured 2
meters from the cask. This would be comparable to a chest x-ray for each
hour that a worker or a member of the public was close to the cask.
Traffic jams or stops for fueling are situations that could lead to
repeated or ongoing radiation exposures for individuals living and
working along transport routes. Cumulative low-dose radiation exposure
impose a measurable impact in a population. Health studies have shown
that this type of exposure causes <I>more</I> cancer per unit of dose
than acute exposures in the higher dose range. If a person is exposed to
10 millirems, once a year, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission assigns a 1
in 2850 chance of fatal cancer from that lifetime exposure. </H5> 
<H3>What is &quot;Multi-Purpose Canister Base Case?&quot;</H3> 
<H5>A scenario defined by the Department of Energy for projections
about the shipping campaign. It assumes the use of the largest
containers that are possible at each site (rail preferred over truck).
The Multi-Purpose Canister (MPC) would seal huge amounts of waste--the
large one holds 21,000 pounds--in a container at the reactor site. This
canister is then to be put in a transport overpack for shipping. The
large rail MPC holds over 20 times the radioactive waste as the old
truck casks. The MPC has not yet been built, tested or licensed. To
date, no transport cask has had full-scale physical testing. The
Department of Energy has instead relied on computer simulations. The
scenario also assumes no new reactors. Current reactor operations are
projected to end in 2030.</H5> 
<H3>What about the Bottom Line--the Economic Factors?</H3> 
<H5>Part of routine transport for this dangerous material is local
preparedness. Local emergency responders will in nearly all cases be the
first to assess an accident scene. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission
(NRC) estimated in 1981<B> </B>(NUREG/CR-2225) that the price tag for a
fully prepared state emergency response system would cost $5.6 million
<I>annually</I> (1981 dollars). This does not include infrastructure
improvements and maintenance that are likely associated with state
efforts to designate alternate routes. Congress is making no direct
effort to ensure any level of funding will be available. Other economic
impacts include cost of unrecovered health impacts, negative effects on
business, tourism, property value and property marketability, and
unclear liability for these effects.</H5> 
<H5>NRC also made a 1980 estimate of the costs associated with an
accident. Even a small fraction of the radioactivity in a single
shipping cask were released in an urban area, the clean up costs would
be on the order of $2 billion dollars. &quot;Clean up&quot; means
transferring the radioactivity somewhere else. Though it started as
high-level waste, clean-up from contamination would currently be
designated &quot;low-level&quot; waste. It is not clear who would pay
for the clean-up or disposal from a high-level civilian waste transport
accident. In most cases &quot;clean-up&quot; would scar the site or
alternately, quite a bit of radioactivity may be left behind as a
'sacrifice zone.<B>'</B> </H5> 
<H3>Factoids:</H3> 
<H5>Total &quot;Base Case&quot; projected rail casks: 9,421; total
truck casks: 6,217. 15,638 casks total.</H5> 
<H5>If Congress lifts the cap on how much waste could go to an
&quot;interim storage site&quot; and if instead of the &quot;MPC
Base-Case&quot; scenario, only trucks are used, there would be over
60,000 shipments nationwide.</H5> 
<H5>An average rail car carries 174 pounds of plutonium. A truck cask
carries 38 pounds of plutonium.</H5> 
<H5>The shipment of 85,000 MTU of high-level waste will also move
1,800,000 pounds of plutonium.</H5> 
<H5>The plutonium 239 alone in these shipments could generate over
1,500,000 cancers if released. This amount of plutonium 239 is more than
120 times greater than the total released to date by below-ground
nuclear weapons testing, worldwide.</H5> 
<H5>The total of 85,000 metric tonnes that is to be shipped contains
nearly 2 million times more cesium than the Hiroshima bomb. </H5>

<H2>171 ORGANIZATIONS WORLDWIDE CONDEMN U.S. MOX DECISION; ASK PRESIDENT
CLINTON TO STOP PLUTONIUM FUEL APPROACH</H2>
<P>171 environmental, peace, and medical organizations today condemned
outgoing-Department of Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary's decision to pursue an
option that would use plutonium-based fuel (or mixed-oxide, MOX) in commercial
nuclear reactors as a means of attempting to make plutonium from nuclear weapons
into a non-weapons-ready form.</P>
<P>The 171 groups, from every corner of the globe, said that the MOX fuel
approach would increase international commerce in plutonium, would create even
hotter high-level radioactive waste, and would provide a disincentive for
anti-proliferation efforts across the world.</P>
<P>The letter to President Clinton was signed by organizations from Russia,
Japan, Turkey, Canada, the Netherlands, Ukraine, Slovokia, Lithuania and several
other countries. 100 of the signers were from U.S. organizations, which also
cited increased security, transportation, nuclear safety and other risks
involved with plutonium-based fuel.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;Hazel O'Leary has made a great contribution by publicizing past
radiation experiments on the American people,&quot; said Michael Mariotte,
executive director of Nuclear Information and Resource Service, which
coordinated the international letter to Clinton,&quot; but by supporting the use
of plutonium fuel in civilian nuclear reactors, her legacy could be her greatest
mistake. Use of MOX fuel would be the largest, and potentially most tragic,
radiation experiment ever unleashed on the American people.&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Said Harvey Wasserman of Greenpeace, USA, &quot;The international nature of
this letter's signers' indicates the global opposition to MOX fuel. Across the
world, people are saying no to plutonium, and no to creation of a
military-industrial-utility complex.&quot;</P>
<P>The DOE has said it must pursue MOX because Russia views its plutonium as an
asset rather than a waste, and thus also wants to use the controversial process.
But without western economic aid, Russia is unlikely to attain the resources to
use the MOX approach. Moreover, Russian groups signing the letter indicated that
the Russian people oppose use of MOX fuel as well. Vladimiar Sliviak of Russia's
Socio-Ecological Union said that Russian environmental organizations are working
to cut Russian funding and government support for MOX programs.</P>
<P>Secretary O'Leary has suggested that if U.S. opposition to MOX is too
strong, then the U.S. government would consider using Canadian reactors to &quot;burn&quot;
the plutonium fuel. But, said, Irene Kock of Canada's Nuclear Awareness Project,
&quot;Canadians refuse to be the world's dumping ground for high level nuclear
waste. If plutonium fuel is sent to Canada, we're supposed to keep the waste.
Canadians will not tolerate this deal--it's a very dangerous precedent. The U.S.
and Russia must secure their plutonum stocks safely within their own boundaries.&quot;</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;Ontario Hydro is simply using the plutonium fuel scheme to justify
rebuilding the aging Bruce reactors, which will otherwise be shut down early,
and to obtain operating subsidies,&quot; Kock continued. &quot;Is the U.S. DOE
prepared to subsidize Ontario's public utility?&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Said Michael Mariotte of NIRS, &quot;This is just the first step in our
anti-MOX campaign. We are now preparing to take our legitimate concerns to the
American people to make it impossible for any U.S. utility or government entity
to bring plutonium into our states and communities. We agree that weapons-ready
plutonium must be made inaccessible, but MOX fuel in commercial reactors simply
compounds the problem. We're seeking solutions, not short-cuts.&quot;</P>
<P>A copy of the letter to President Clinton, with a list of all signers, is
available upon request from NIRS.</P>
<P>Signers of the letter included 100 grassroots organizations and individuals
from the United States, 36 organizations from Turkey and the Eastern
Mediterranean; 9 Russian environmental organizations; five groups from Canada,
three from Japan and the Netherlands, two from Ukraine, Scotland, and Germany,
and one each from Austria, Czech Republic, England, India, Lithuania, New
Zealand, Slovokia, South Africa, and Sweden.</P>

<P>December 20, 1996</P>

<P>The Honorable Hazel R. O'Leary</P>

<P>Secretary of Energy</P>

<P>U.S. Department of Energy</P>

<P>Washington, D.C.</P>

<P>Dear Madam Secretary:</P>

<P>The conversion of surplus military plutonium into a non-weapons-usable
form is an extremely important disarmament goal that all of us share with
you. We believe this work must be accomplished in a manner that does not
introduce new security dangers and also serves to protect the health and
the environment of the communities where it is to be carried out, now and
for future generations.</P>

<P>For these reasons, we want you to know, as you proceed to your Record
of Decision on disposal of excess U.S. military plutonium, we are troubled
that the Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement articulates a &quot;dual
track&quot; strategy giving equal weight over the next two years to examining
both the mixed-oxide (MOX) fuel and the direct immobilization options.
Given the proliferation risks associated with fabrication and use of MOX
fuel, as well as the additional delays, costs, and safety and environmental
risks associated with this option, we ask that you make explicit in your
Record of Decision that the direct immobilization option, once successfully
demonstrated, will be used exclusively to dispose of all excess U.S. plutonium.</P>

<P>Some of our organizations are unalterably opposed to the Department
of Energy introducing <I>any</I> plutonium as MOX fuel in nuclear power
plants under any circumstances, while others are willing to consider MOX
as an insurance policy to be implemented only if the direct immobilization
option proves infeasible or incapable of meeting an agreed timetable for
reducing U.S. and Russian plutonium to roughly equal levels. </P>

<P>We are all confident, however, that with an appropriate combination
of resolve, resources and independent peer review, your Department can
demonstrate that <I>all</I> of the excess U.S. military plutonium, including
pits, can be directly immobilized in waste, safely and securely and at
a rate that will meet an agreed timetable for reductions. We stand united
in our resolve to prevent use of MOX fuel in nuclear power plants once
it is demonstrated that MOX use can be avoided altogether by using direct
immobilization instead. </P>

<P>We are also united in support of the goal of rapid disposal of excess
military plutonium in the United States and Russia in a manner that maintains
parity with Russia as both sides work toward the global disarmament objective
of eliminating all weapons plutonium. MOX can be shown to be avoidable,
and it is imprudent for the United States---after pursuing a two-decade
policy of avoiding introduction of MOX fuel at home and not encouraging
its use abroad---to open up the United States to this technology and to
facilitate its deployment in Russia, particularly when Russia continues
to separate plutonium for commercial use. Such a course will only exacerbate
the problems of nuclear proliferation and radioactive contamination of
the environment. U.S. dollars are now best spent on validating the direct
immobilization approach so that it can be available for both the United
States and Russia. </P>

<P>Regarding Russian plutonium, the problem at this point is that the United
States has no counter to Europeans and Japanese who, with plutonium-fuel
technology to sell, are pushing the MOX option in Russia and asking the
United States to help pay for it. We, therefore, support the proposal made
in a recent <I>New York Times</I> editorial that &quot;America should encourage,
and perhaps help to finance, a demonstration plant for vitrification in
Russia...&quot;</P>

<P>From the standpoint of sound engineering and fiscal integrity, DOE should
put its priorities in the most promising and least costly technology. One
immobilization alternative, &quot;can-in-a-canister,&quot; is projected
by DOE to begin in the United States six years sooner and be completed
13 years before the alternative method of turning the plutonium into fuel
and using it in five existing nuclear powerplants. The existing-reactor
MOX option is also estimated to cost $1.5 billion more3 than the &quot;can-in-canister&quot;
approach, although this estimate is highly optimistic because it assumes
only a half-billion dollars in incentive payments for electrical utility
companies when billions could be required. </P>

<P>Once can-in-a-canister, or an alternative direct immobilization approach,
is validated, the United States then will be in a far stronger position
than it is today to make a generous offer of this technology in the form
of a joint venture with Russia that could serve as an attractive alternative
to the MOX option that is now being proposed for Russia by commercial plutonium
interests in Europe and Japan. </P>

<P>On the other hand, moving toward rapid implementation of the MOX option
by giving it equal priority with immobilization raises a number of clearly
avoidable cost, safety and proliferation risks.</P>

<P>We urge in the strongest terms, therefore, that your Record of Decision
take the following form:</P>

<P>1. Place top program and budget priority on proving the immobilization
option, with particular emphasis on the can-in-a-canister approach that
presently appears to be the most promising, but also exploring other immobilization
options, including ceramic as well as glass.</P>

<P>2. Make clear that when direct immobilization is validated, it will
be used to its full potential---with the goal of disposing of all excess
military plutonium, including pits, and not simply reserved to dispose
of impure scraps and residues. If you are not prepared to rule out consideration
of the MOX approach at this time, you can make clear that the United States
is examining the MOX option for insurance purposes only and is not committed
to a combination of the MOX and direct immobilization options. Failure
to make such a clarification and commitment in your Record of Decision
invites active opposition to planned research and development by DOE involving
irradiation and post-irradiation experiments on MOX fuel pellets and assemblies
in the United States and Canada.</P>

<P>3. Make clear that the United States regards plutonium as a dangerous
liability, not as a valuable energy resource. We also ask you to make clear
the United States is &quot;strongly opposed&quot; to commercial use of
plutonium, and thereby deny European, Japanese and Russian plutonium interests
any opportunity to exploit the dual-track approach to their advantage---as
they already have begun doing to win public support for their MOX, reprocessing
and breeder programs. </P>

<P>Madam Secretary, we hope that in your Record of Decision, you will exercise
the leadership that is urgently needed at this critical stage of plutonium
disposition by stating a clear preference for direct immobilization as
the primary disposal strategy. </P>

<P>Thank you for your consideration of our views on this urgent matter.
We would appreciate the opportunity to meet to discuss them with you.</P>

<H2>Broad Opposition To DOE Proposal To Use  Weapons Plutonium For Commercial
Nuclear Power Reactor Fuel</H2>
<P>Washington, D.C.  A growing coalition of national, international and
grassroots groups today announced vigorous opposition to a plan by the U.S.
Department of Energy (DOE) that could lead to the use of approximately 50 tons
of plutonium from nuclear bombs as fuel in U.S. commercial nuclear reactors. 
The DOE today released a Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS) on
plutonium disposition that advocates investigating two options: use as fuel or
immobilize in glass for permanent storage of excess military plutonium.</P>
<P>One of the options involves combining plutonium and uranium into mixed-oxide
(MOX) fuel pellets for use in nuclear power reactors.  The other is to vitrify
(encapsulate in glass) plutonium into a waste form.  The pursuit of the MOX
option would undermine a 20-year United States policy to avoid the civilian use
of plutonium.  In addition, if a MOX fabrication plant were in operation, there
would be renewed pressure for the DOE to increase the reprocessing of irradiated
(spent) fuel to isolate plutonium which could then be used as MOX.</P>
<P>&quot;This is a stunning reversal of the prudent foundation of U.S.
nonproliferation policy designed to keep nuclear weapons out of the hands of
terrorists and rogue states,&quot; said Jim Adams, Senior Analyst for the Safe
Energy Communication Council.  &quot;Opposed by many scientists, experts and the
public, developing the MOX option would open a dangerous Pandora's box,&quot; he
concluded.</P>
<P>The PEIS failed to formally consider the economic and nonproliferation
factors weighing against the use of MOX.  These issues were discussed in other
documents that were not subjectto the strict standards required by the National
Environmental Policy Act.  &quot;It is important that Secretary of Energy Hazel
O'Leary weigh the cost and nonproliferation factors that were kept out of the
PEIS before arriving at a final decision,&quot; noted Paul Leventhal, President
of the Nuclear Control Institute.  &quot;Plutonium fuel in commercial reactors
makes no sense from a cost standpoint and is downright dangerous from a
proliferation standpoint.  Vitrification makes sense from both perspectives and
should be her first choice,&quot; concluded Mr. Leventhal.</P>
<P>The pursuit of the MOX option will send the wrong signal to other countries
about a change in the U.S. position on nuclear fuel policy.  &quot;Using the MOX
fuel option for plutonium disposition will take longer, be more expensive, and
encourage world-wide use of plutonium, a key component of nuclear weapons,&quot;
stated Maureen Eldredge, Program Director for the Military Production Network, a
coalition of grassroots organizations.  &quot;There is no good rationale for
continuing down this dangerous path.  If this is an example of how the U.S.
shows strong leadership on international security issues, we are in big trouble.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Greenpeace opposes any recommendation by the DOE to use plutonium as
nuclear fuel.The decision to use MOX is a wrong-headed and risky reversal of
U.S. nonproliferation policy and is being made to the satisfaction of the
plutonium industry in Russia, France, Britain, and Japan,&quot; said Tom
Clements, a spokesman for Greenpeace International.  &quot;We will vigorously
work to oppose the use of plutonium fuel and promote its treatment as nuclear
waste,&quot;  he concluded.  Bill Magavern, the Director of Public Citizen's
Critical Mass Energy Project, declared, &quot;Citizens groups across the country
have stopped previous attempts to use plutonium as a reactor fuel and we will
fight this proposal as long as a better alternative exists-- and immobilization
is a better alternative.&quot;</P>
<P>Furthermore, the U.S. is worried about the intention of Russian leaders who
are leaning towards the development of a MOX industry to deal with surplus
plutonium from thedismantlement of nuclear weapons.  &quot;The most important
result of a decision to pursue a MOX option will be to encourage Russia to
produce more weapons-usable plutonium from used nuclear reactor fuel.  It will
help create a surreal cycle by which Russia will make spent fuel out of weapons
plutonium only to extract more plutonium out of the reactor spent fuel, thereby
perpetuating the threat of theft and diversion,&quot; said Dr. Arjun Makhijani,
President of the Institute for Energy and Environmental Research in Takoma Park,
Maryland.</P>
<P>Another major concern for coalition members is the impact of the DOE
providing significant subsidies to the nuclear power industry to facilitate the
use of MOX in commercial reactors.  &quot;This smells like polluter pork to me,&quot;
said Anna Aurilio, a staff scientist with the U.S. Public Interest Research
Group.  &quot;It is scary that utility executives would be bribed to keep
operating their aging, uneconomic reactors,&quot; she added</P>
<P>&quot;We have major problems in the U.S. with nuclear power wastes, and now
DOE is going to spend hundreds of millions of tax-payer dollars to subsidize
failing, uneconomic reactors, which will generate wastes more dangerous and
complicated than what we have today,&quot; declared Mary Olson, a spokesperson
for the Nuclear Information and Resource Service.  &quot;The concerns of
citizens in reactor communities, who will be directly affected by the use of MOX
fuel, did not influence the development of this policy, but they will have a lot
to say about whether it will be implemented,&quot; she concluded.</P>
<P>&quot;Commercial use of plutonium poses significant radiological hazards to
facility workers and highly radioactive waste streams which imperil the
surrounding environment and for which there are no viable waste management
solution.  The better approach would be to convert the plutonium into glassified
waste for permanent underground disposal,&quot;  concluded Timothy Takaro, a
board member of Physicians for Social Responsibility.</P>

<H3>     INTRODUCTION</H3>
<P>The nuclear industry has an expression &quot;Luck makes a lousy safeguard.&quot;
</P>
<P>To a large measure as now revealed, the public's health and safety has
increasingly relied upon &quot;luck&quot; or chance at the Connecticut Yankee
atomic power station.  Recent revelations document crucial safety equipment
inoperable for the 28 years of the nuclear station's operation, design
miscalculations involving equipment vital to controlling the reactor core in the
event of a nuclear accident, gross mismanagement and a persistent neglect of the
station's safety standards,  misinstallation of components and failure to
maintain the station's safety features in conformance with its design, for
economic reasons hedging on the repair of  deteriorating safety-related
components and finally a near-miss accident.  These unresolved  issues and more
point to a public safety net that was never there for the New England
communities surrounding Connecticut Yankee. </P>
<P>The Connecticut Yankee atomic power plant on the Connecticut River in Haddam
Neck, CT is a 616-megawatt  pressurized water reactor commissioned into
commercial power generation in January, 1968. It is owned by a consortium of New
England electric utilities with the largest holding by Northeast Utilities. </P>
<P>Northeast Utilities (NU), based in Berlin, CT,  is the largest nuclear
utility in New England and through the employment of its wholly-owned
subsidiaries is the operator of  Connecticut Yankee (Connecticut Yankee Atomic
Power Co.) as well as the Millstone Units 1, 2, and 3 (Northeast Energy Service
Co.)  in Waterford, CT and  Seabrook Station (North Atlantic Energy Service
Corp.) in New Hampshire.  As a co-owner in Maine Yankee at Wiscasset, Maine, and
Vermont Yankee near Brattleboro, Vermont, NU arguably maintains a degree of
influence at these atomic power stations through each respective board of
directors.  </P>
<P>Historically, Northeast Utilities has been the subject of  long standing
community activist and health professional concerns because of the electric
utility's disregard of public health and safety;  most notoriously for periodic
large airborne releases of radiation from its Millstone Unit 1 station which
totaled 3 million curies in 1975 alone.&lt;1&gt;  More recently however, NU's
practices at  its Connecticut reactors provided a shock therapy to a
lackadaisical federal regulator, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC),  after
persistent company whistle-blower concerns publicly spotlighted safety issues at
the reactors and a U.S. Department of Justice criminal investigation was
initiated into the utility's operations at Millstone.</P>
<P>Before revelations of numerous safety violations, Connecticut Yankee was
rated as one of the nuclear industry's better-than-average performers, with a
life-time generating capacity of  75 %. These problems bring to light that plant
performance was achieved only at an increased risk to a public unaware of
numerous hazards literally built into the plant and shortcuts taken by a utility
determined to maintain its profit margin.</P>
<P>Connecticut Yankee was taken off-line on July 22, 1996 to address safety
issues involving the reactor's service water system to the emergency core
cooling system. Additional problems began surfacing at the reactor and NU
decided to further delay the restart.   In August, Connecticut Yankee commenced
an early refueling outage originally scheduled for September, 1996.   With its
three Millstone units already shutdown in unplanned outages and reactor restart
pending clearance from the NRC troubled reactor watch list, NU was spending $30
million a month to provide replacement power costs to its New England service
area.  </P>
<P>Northeast Utilities seeks to minimize the public safety impact of these
problems by framing their reactor troubles as issues of paper flow management
and whether the reactor remains an &quot;economic producer&quot; of electricity.
 During the summer of 1996, faced with increased NRC scrutiny, Connecticut
Yankee's joint owners requested that a company analysis be conducted to
determine the reactor's economic viability. The report's finding, released on
October 9, announced that  immediate closure was significantly cheaper than
operation till the end of the reactor's current license in 2007.    Connecticut
Yankee may now be permanently closed because its owners are unwilling to take
the financial risk of addressing the multitude of issues that pose a health and
safety risks to the public.</P>
<P>Even with the results of the company's economic analysis favoring immediate
shutdown, however, Connecticut Yankee spokespeople have stated that it is not a
foregone conclusion that the joint owners will ultimately decide to permanently
close the reactor.&lt;2&gt;  A number of  uncertainties provide disincentives to
early closure, including the underaccrulment of the reactor's projected
decommissioning costs and fear of the public and political perceptions of
permanently closing the only Connecticut reactor that is not on the NRC Problem
Plant Watch List.  </P>
<P>Indeed, Connecticut Yankee's deep-seated problems are not unique to this
reactor but symptomatic of a larger and more systemic problem running throughout
Northeast Utilities' management of all its reactors.   Under growing pressure,
the NRC is coming around to recognize this more profound concern not only for
the utility's proposed reopening and operation of the remaining Connecticut
reactors but also with the on-going operation of New Hampshire's Seabrook
nuclear generating station.&lt;3&gt;  </P>
<P>While the NRC's recent activities arising out of NU problems at its
Connecticut reactors have been aggressive, these actions have largely been
reactive to chronic safety-significant problems that have persisted through
decades of disregard to fundamental regulatory standards.  It is of great
concern that problems involving lack of documentation, inaccuracies in existing
documents, and the repeated violation of regulations governing documentation of
modifications to safety-significant features at the reactors could only have
occurred through the absence of any meaningful NRC regulatory oversight.  </P>
<P>The goal of this report is to advocate for the immediate and permanent
closure of Connecticut Yankee.  The report lays out a series of outstanding
public safety concerns that pertain to any Connecticut Yankee proposal to
return-to-service under a management re-organization plan to operate the plant 
more &quot;economically-efficient&quot; and to &quot;better document&quot;
reactor safety modifications.   This report outlines these significant reactor
problems to point to an underlying and more safety-significant managerial
attitude that would continue to jeopardize public health and safety if
Connecticut Yankee were allowed to come back on-line.  Of significant concern
regarding Connecticut Yankee and public health and safety, this report addresses
how undocumented conditions involving Connecticut Yankee design bases vs. the
reactor's as-built condition potentially affect Connecticut Yankee
decommissioning under current NRC regulatory policy.  </P>
<P>While the report focuses on Connecticut Yankee, the generic nature of NU
managerial approach to safety problems also extends to NU's other reactors. 
Similarly, the authors advocate the permanent closure of NU's Millstone 1, 2,
and 3 units already on the NRC problem plants list due a long history of
negligence, persistent mismanagement and chronic disregard for public health and
safety.   </P>
<H3>I. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH DESIGN ISSUES AND PLANT SAFETY ANALYSIS</H3>
<P>All nuclear reactors licensed by the NRC must conform with safety  standards
governing operation under normal and emergency conditions. The  plant design
features that satisfy the NRC's safety regulations, along with the analyses
performed to demonstrate this compliance, are embodied in the  voluminous
Updated Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR) for each plant. </P>
<P>The operators are allowed to make changes to the plant under Code of 
Federal Regulation (10 CFR 50.59) so long as the changes do not constitute an &quot;unreviewed
safety issue.&quot; An ureviewed safety issue is defined as any activity which
increases the likelihood or consequences of a previously evaluated accident,
introduces a new type of accident or reduces safety margins at the reactor.  All
changes to the plant and revisions to the supporting analyses are required to be
periodically documented  in the UFSAR.  Information contained in the UFSARs is
used by the operator for emergency procedures, training, and as a baseline for
any future modifications of reactor systems and procedures.  </P>
<P>Revelations of long standing violations of the 10 CFR 50.59 process at
Northeast Utilities Millstone nuclear units not only brought increased
regulatory scrutiny to the three units at Waterford, CT but also disclosured NU
mismanagement and negligent practices at its Connecticut Yankee reactor.  </P>
<P>Early in 1996,  NU workers made public disclosures of practices at the
Millstone units documenting that the utility had failed to maintain complete and
accurate information in the reactor's UFSAR. At the risk of their careers within
the nuclear industry,  the NU employees  revealed that the Millstone units along
with a number of other utility operators were misusing the 10 CFR 50.59 process
to make changes to the UFSAR without adequately evaluating the potential safety
consequences related the performed activities at the reactors.  </P>
<P>Over the years, Northeast Utilities has acquired a sordid history of
harassing and intimidating conscientious workers who have brought forward safety
concerns at each of its nuclear units.  Over the past four years, NU has been
fined on three occasions at $100,000 for each violation as a result for
harassing employees who raised safety concerns. NU has been cited for creating &quot;an
unhealthy work environment, which did not tolerate dissenting views.''   In this
environment, NU management aggressively fostered a climate where engineering
problems dealing with safety issues were often approached by first waiting to
find an economical solution before officially reporting the problem. 
Consequently over the years, an indeterminate number of  safety problems at the
NU reactors have been left unaddressed and undocumented by the company.    As
such,  NU provides a clear example of an electric utility that has prioritized a
competition-first and safety-second approach to managing its nuclear power
plants. </P>
<P>A last straw fell in August of 1995, when NU employees filed an emergency
enforcement action petition with the NRC bringing forward allegations of
repeated safety violations during refueling operations at Millstone 1.  The
allegations charged that NU &quot;knowingly, willingly, and flagrantly&quot;
violated their license with the NRC through a 20 year old practice of offloading
the entire reactor fuel core into the plant's storage pond without fully
analyzing the operation's safety implications and ignoring a mandated  250-hour
cooldown period for burned atomic fuel  in order to expedite the procedure to
60-hours and cut company cost.  Workers complained that the expedited procedure
endangered their crews-- in one case the work environment was so hot that NU
employees working on the refueling floor of  the reactor pressure vessel had
their rubber shoes melt.</P>
<P>As a result of increased public exposure and federal scrutiny, an internal
NU Event Response Team was chartered to determine the causes for &quot;inaccuracies&quot;
contained in the Millstone Unit I UFSAR.  The company's own internal report
revealed that Millstone's safety evaluation &quot;<I>did not fully address
regulatory requirements</I>&quot; and that &quot;<I>NU did not see the UFSAR as
a document that was required to be accurate.</I>&quot; &lt;4&gt; (emphasis
added).  The report further indicated that  &quot;The long term pattern of
decisions and actions has generic implications for Connecticut Yankee and
Millstone Units 2 and 3.&quot;&lt;5&gt;   </P>
<P>After persistent company stonewalling of the employees' safety concerns at
Millstone, simultaneously evidenced that the NRC had long since turned a blind
eye to the procedure, the whistleblowers' went  to TIME magazine which published
a cover story (March 4, 1996) exposing this precariously dangerous practice at
Millstone and the failure of the federal agency to oversee operations at the
reactor. </P>
<P>The TIME magazine article flared into a significant public relations
embarrassment for the NRC.  The article exposed the NRC at best  as a federal
watchdog found sleeping in a nuclear junkyard, and at worst operating in
collusion with the nuclear industry to prioritize company profits over worker
and  public safety.</P>
<P>In response, NRC Chairwoman Dr. Shirley Jackson initiated an industry-wide
assessment  of licensee maintenance of their UFSARs and determined that an
additional 18 facilities were conducting similar refueling outages out of
compliance with their final safety evaluations.  </P>
<P>Other chronic structural problems and adverse-to-safety practices began to
surface at the Millstone units raising increased concerns about NU's ability to
competently operate any of its nuclear reactors.  In May, 1996 NU discovered a
32 inch by 9 inch hole in the Millstone unit 2 auxiliary building wall near
irradiate fuel pool reported to be roughly the size of a &quot;doggie door&quot;
in the radiologically controlled and supposedly pressure-tested  area of the
station.  The deficiency apparently existed for an extended time demonstrating
an inadequate surveillance testing program.   In July, 1996, it was disclosed
that during the construction of Millstone unit 3, NU in an effort to speed up a
lagging construction schedule, opted to use a fast-drying concrete rather than
the standard portland cement with its longer cure timemduring the pouring of the
reactor's foundation. The quick dry concrete is now eroding out of the reactor
building, raising issues of uncertainty as to the extent of the damage and
effect on reactor containment integrity. All three Millstone units have
repeatedly reported events involving operation outside of the design bases,
including an October 1996 report of the improper setting of the steam generator
safety relief valves at Millstone Unit 2. The deficiency, existing since the
reactor's initial startup in 1975, represented the potential for
overpressurizing the steam generators and invalidating assumptions regarding
steam tube ruptures. The fact that the problem went undetected during
Millstone's replacement of the steam generators demonstrates that NU's design
modification process has been deficient.    </P>
<P>The deficiencies displayed at NU's troubled Millstone units fingerprinted
the utility's systemic mismanagement practices that implicated operations at
Connecticut Yankee.</P> 
<H3>II.UTILITY MISUSE OF REGULATIONS GOVERNING MODIFICATIONS OF DESIGN</H3>
<P>During March  and April 1996, a special NRC inspection team assessed the
engineering and licensing activities at Connecticut Yankee with a focus on the
utility's processes used to identify, evaluate, and resolve technical issues.
</P>
<P>The NRC special  inspection stated,</P>
<P>&quot;The team identified a number of significant deficiencies in the
engineering calculations and analyses which were relied upon to ensure the
adequacy of the design of key safety systems at Haddam Neck.  In some cases,
design-bases calculations and analyses were incorrect and did not confirm that
the safety system functional requirements would be met.  Some of these errors
were long-standing, while others were recently introduced during modifications
to the facility... <I>These deficiencies revealed significant weaknesses in the
defense-in-depth principles that the NRC relies upon to ensure nuclear power
plant operation does not jeopardize the health and safety of the public. </I>&quot;&lt;6&gt;
(emphasis added)   Systems at Haddam Neck affected by these deficiencies
included the emergency diesel generators (EDG) and the emergency core cooling
system (ECCS).  Additionally, emergency operating procedures lacked guidance for
recovering the reactor from various accident conditions involving the manual
transfer from the immediate ECCS safety injection system to the necessary
long-term cooling function of the sump recirculation system for the ECCS to
maintain reactor core stability following an accident.     </P>
<P>NRC noted in the special inspection of Connecticut Yankee that NU had made
changes to the UFSAR without performing evaluations to determine whether the
modification introduced an increase in the likelihood or consequences of a
previously evaluated accident, introduced a new type of accident or reduced
safety margins at the reactor. This is required under the NRC's regulations
(10CFR50.59).  Several errors were discovered in  a number of drawings which &quot;create
the potential for the introduction of more significant errors in future plant
design changes and operating practices.&quot;&lt;7&gt;   The issue of faulty
evaluations and incorrect diagrams is of particular concern to the interests of
public health and safety during any future Connecticut Yankee decommissioning
operations which relyed upon them.  These diagrams and evaluations constitute
the blueprints and safety analysis to protect both worker and public during
decommissioning activities.</P>
<H3>A.  FEEDWATER REGULATING VALVES</H3>
<P>On July 9, 1996, NRC completed another inspection at Connecticut Yankee
Atomic Power Company as the result of identified design and licensing basis
discrepancies. The NRC's stated intent for this series of inspections was that
the licensee &quot;implement compensatory measures as needed to assure the
continued operability of components important to safe plant operation.&quot;&lt;8&gt;
  </P>
<P>The July inspection noted that on June 11, 1996, a design engineer at
Connecticut Yankee identified a component design deficiency that existed in the
feedwater regulating valves (FRV) with significant adverse safety implications. 
The feedwater regulating valves control the rate at which water from the
condenser is supplied to the steam generators.  The position of the FRVs is
controlled automatically to maintain the desired water level on the secondary
side of the steam generators.  Basically, the control logic balances feedwater
flow with main steam flow in order to maintain a constant level. An automatic
control is required since the main steam flow (and feedwater flow) varies with
the power level.</P>
<P>The FRVs must automatically close in event of a main steam line break. With
the FRVs closed, the containment pressurization terminates once the steam
generator boils dry (i.e., all the water in the steam generator is boiled off
through the broken steam line into the containment space).  If the FRVs do not
close, water will continue to be supplied to the steam generator and will
continue to escape as steam to the containment.  The ultimate consequence would
be containment failure due to overpressurization and the release of radiation to
the environment. </P>
<P>The engineer identified that the valve had not been evaluated for a
worst-case main steam line break condition and could not fully close against a
main steam line break for the affected steam generator. The NRC inspection team
subsequently identified  numerous opportunities, starting as earlier as 1981,
where the component's design safety function should  have been properly
validated or verified by Northeast Utilities as part of a required safety
evaluation for making modifications to the reactor's technical specifications,
as required by 10 CFR 50.59.  </P>
<P>NU had concluded in its safety evaluations that modifications did not
represent an &quot;unreviewed safety question.&quot;  Numerous modifications to
the reactor's technical specifications contained in the Updated Final Safety
Analysis Report had been approved by NRC  for the feedwater regulation valve. 
Despite these opportunities to detect this safety deficiency, the licensee made
no calculations or tests to justify that the feedwater regulation valves would
operate as intended to mitigate a main steam line break accident. </P>
<P>According to the NRC, in the event of a main steam line break accident,
failure of these safety significant components could  cause a condition that
exceeds the analyzed containment pressure and temperature design limits
cascading into a breach of containment and release of radiation to the
environment.  The NRC inspection further concluded, &quot;The failure to operate
the facility in accordance with the UFSAR is considered an apparent violation. A
lack of thorough reviews in past safety evaluations occurred because the
licensee failed to compare the FRVs design to that response necessary to
mitigate the consequences of an accident.&quot;&lt;9&gt;</P>
<H3>B.  PIPE PROBLEMS UNDERMINE LOSS-OF-COOLANT-ACCIDENT RECOVERY</H3>
<P>On August 10, 1996, the NRC completed an additional  four week inspection
into various aspects of Connecticut Yankee operations, maintenance, engineering,
and plant support. This inspection, released in September 1996, revealed that
for 28 years, a piping system that supports Connecticut Yankee's &quot;emergency
core cooling system has been too small the ensure that enough water would be
available to prevent a meltdown during a worse-case accident&quot; as reported
to the public in a Connecticut newspaper.&lt;10&gt;  </P>
<P>The NRC Inspection Report 50-213/96-08 noted concerns with the adequacy of
the analytical evaluations, plant design features and as-built conditions vital
to assuring an operable emergency core cooling system at Connecticut Yankee. 
</P>
<P>As a background, several systems are used at the Connecticut Yankee reactor
for  recirculation cooling to the reactor core following a potential
Loss-Of-Coolant-Accident exampled by a main steam line break, steam generator
tube ruptures or other reactor coolant piping system.  These recirculation
systems include the Residual Heat Removal (RHR) system, the High Pressure Safety
Injection system and the charging portion of the Chemical and Volume Control
system.   Immediately following an accident, the High Pressure Safety Injection
begins the refill of  the reactor vessel with coolant water drawn off of the
Refueling Water Storage Tank.  After the storage tank has been emptied to a
specified low water level during the injection phase, the RHR pumps and heat
exchangers are activated to recirculate spilled water collected in the
containment sump, a large concrete pit at the lowest elevation in the reactor
building.  The spilled coolant water is then recirculated back to the reactor
cooling system via the charging system consisting of three parallel pumps and
the high pressure injection system.  </P>
<P>The problem was identified by NRC as  inadequate &quot;Net Positive Suction
Head&quot;  (NPSH) involving  the potential introduction of steam vapor into the
RHR pump system causing a break in the vacuum and the pumps to &quot;cavitate&quot;.
 &quot;Cavitation&quot; of a pump occurs when air or low pressure vapor (the
combination of steam and water) is introduced or generated within the pump
system resulting in variable pump speeds and intense vibration causing the pump
to destroy itself along with the loss of its long term reactor cooling function.
 Under postulated accident conditions, the maximum containment sump temperatures
could reach as high as 252 degrees F.  Warmer water circulating up from the
containment sump system during the recirculation recovery phase from a LOCA
would have a tendency to flash to steam between the sump and the RHR pumps
causing the pumps to cavitate. </P>
<P>Since the reactor first started up 28 years ago, Connecticut Yankee has
relied on predicted containment back pressures and temperatures under accident
conditions to support RHR flow through the system's 8 and 10 inch piping.
However, the licensee's calculations for predicted temperatures and pressures
have been changing over time due to the discovery of errors.  When NRC
inspectors requested Connecticut Yankee to provide evidence to support its
reliance on containment back pressure, NU was unable to provide a clear
reference in the reactor's UFSAR or any other licensing documentation.  NRC
reported that &quot;A primary concern of the staff was the fact that the
containment overpressure relied upon was significantly greater than any
previously approved calculation.&quot;&lt;11&gt;    </P>
<P>Consequently, it was determined that Connecticut Yankee had operated for 28
years with its principle safety barriers seriously degraded and in an unanalyzed
condition that significantly compromised safety.  NRC inspection report 96-08
concluded &quot;for past operation of Haddam Neck in modes 1, 2, and 3 prior to
July 22, 1996 the long-term recirculation phase flowpath needed to mitigate
various LOCA's was inoperable&quot; and &quot;past analytical assumptions for
the RHR NPSH was not supportable by detailed evaluations prior to 1996, and once
completed there was inadequate assurance that NPSH requirements would continue
to be satisfied for the range of possible conditions as the containment
depressurized and the sump cooled down during the long term recovery period.&quot;&lt;12&gt;</P>
<H3>C.  MORE PIPING PROBLEMS AND UNANALYZED CONDITIONS:  THE CAR FANS</H3>
<P>Another piping issue involves the service water lines to the containment air
recirculation (CAR) fans.  The failure of these containment coolers would cause
emergency equipment to overheat and fail,  leading to core damage with
containment failure.  The CAR fans are the only credited source for the
Connecticut Yankee's heat removal system following a postulated core accident
which would generate very high temperatures inside the containment building. 
Four such fans are required by Connecticut Yankee technical specifications to be
operational. Vital safety-related components and systems, including the ECCS,
and their electrical power, instrumentation and control cables depend on the CAR
fans, as these components are qualified to operate within required optimal
temperature ranges.  The CAR fans are designed to cool the containment building
so that this equipment can operate to recover and maintain reactor stability
following an accident.  The CAR fans cooling coils are cooled by the station's
service water (SW) pipe system.</P>
<P>Up until its shutdown on July 22, 1996, Connecticut Yankee had performed 359
days of continuous operation when concerns arose over the structural  integrity
of  the service water cooling lines if they were ever challenged under accident
conditions. Connecticut Yankee had been reviewing the performance of the CAR fan
system and the SW lines under postulated accident conditions. As a result, all
four CAR fans were declared inoperable and the reactor was shutdown. </P>
<P>It was determined that the during a Loss of Coolant Accident (LOCA), with an
assumed loss of normal power, that cooling water flow through the SW lines would
be interrupted.  Past evaluations predicted that under accident conditions 
water in the SW line would immediately flash to steam but the force and pressure
generated was concluded to be acceptable.   It had been concluded earlier that
the CAR fans would likewise remain operational.  However, the re-analysis 
determined that a number of thermal-hydraulic phenomena occurring within the 6
inch diameter SW piping, including a steam driven water hammer involving 10,000
cubic feet of steam and a sizable water slug moving at a predicted 250 feet per
second,  were as much as ten times greater than earlier estimates. This was
recognized as a &quot;two-phase flow&quot; (both steam and liquid) through the
service water lines to the CAR fans. Connecticut Yankee had only analyzed a
single-flow condition only (liquid only).  It was determined that &quot;the
two-phase flow in cooling water systems associated with the containment air
coolers can significantly interfere with the ability of the containment air
coolers to remove heat under design-basis accident conditions, and can interfere
with the cooling of other safety-related components.&quot;&lt;13&gt; 
Consequently, the structural integrity of the SW lines to CAR fans came into
serious doubt.</P>
<P>&quot;The existence of excessive hydrodynamic loads in the CAR fan service
water cooling lines under postulated design basis accident conditions
constituted a condition in which the plant operated outside its design basis
since initial plant startup, and resulted in plant operation contrary to the
requirements of Technical Specifications&quot; concluded the NRC inspection.&lt;14&gt;
  The inspection report further stated that the cause for the functional
deficiencies of the CAR-SW system was &quot;a failure of the licensee to
maintain adequate control over the design-basis of the service water system.&quot;&lt;15&gt;
  According to NRC, Connecticut Yankee's violation to maintain CAR fan
performance &quot;had high significance relative to plant safety. With the
assumed failure of the CAR fan service water under postulated accident
conditions, a potential existed for the post accident loss of containment
cooling and longer term containment heat removal.  The postulated rupture of
service water piping downstream of the CAR fans would create the potential for a
leakage path that bypassed the containment, and result in the a release of the
post accident source term [radioactivity directly from the reactor core] through
the open service water system to the discharge canal and the atmosphere.&quot;&lt;16&gt;
</P>
<P>NRC concluded that &quot;service water piping supplying cooling water to the
CAR fans would not remain functional under accident conditions was an example of
an issue for which the design basis for the plant had not been thoroughly
reviewed or understood.&quot;&lt;17&gt;</P>
<P>The same NRC inspection report went on to identify additional deficiencies
at Connecticut Yankee which further jeopardized the successful performance of
the ECCS systems were it ever called upon in the event of an accident.</P>
<H3>D.  CONTAINMENT SUMP SCREEN DESIGN PROBLEMS</H3>
<P>Inspection Report 50-213/96-08 also documents NRC inspections of the
containment sump system to confirm design  information and operability
determinations. The purpose of the containment sump, the large concrete holding
tank at the lowest elevation of the reactor building,  is to collect water
spilling out of the reactor vessel through a broken pipe after a postulated
Loss- Of-Coolant-Accident. The Residual Heat Removal (RHR) pumps draw water from
the containment sump and recirculate this water back to the reactor vessel as
part of the Emergency Core Cooling System during the long term recirculation
phase following an accident.  The sump is divided into two sections; the normal
drainage sump and the RHR suction portion.  Each section is divided by a  low
wall and a vertical wire mesh screen.   The screen's purpose is to limit debris
transport that could potentially clog the ECCS system thereby inhibiting or
preventing reactor core cooling.</P>
<P>Since the early 1980's, NRC and the Connecticut Yankee have exchanged
generic communications pertaining to the questionable reliability of the
containment sump design due to the fact that significant volumes of various
types and sizes of debris (insulating material, rags, cardboard, etc.)  have
tended to collect in the sump area. The problem of debris collecting in the sump
area of nuclear power plants was originally addressed industrywide by the NRC as
an Unresolved Safety Issue number 43 (USI-43). In July, 1975, Connecticut Yankee
had to remove 6 fifty-five gallon drums of sludge and various types of debris,
including welding rods, baling wire, cardboard, and mop heads, from the
containment sump.  On November 18, 1980, NRC  requested that Connecticut Yankee
provide information on containment sump drawings showing important design
features and dimensions as part of the resolution of USI-43.  NRC again
requested Connecticut Yankee to respond under oath through the issuance of a
Request for Additional Information letter [10 CFR 50.54(f)] to address generic
safety issues which included the containment sump reliability issue. </P>
<P>Connecticut Yankee responded to NRC by stating that the containment
emergency sump is a standard design and continued operation applied. 
Connecticut Yankee reiterated its position that the containment sump was of
standard design in 1986.  </P>
<P>Between 1988 and 1993, the NRC issued two information notices (88-28, &quot;Potential
for Loss of Post-LOCA Recirculation Capability Due to Insulation Debris
Blockage,&quot; and 89-77, &quot;Debris In Containment Emergency Sumps and
Incorrect Screen Configuration,&quot; and one NRC bulletin (93-02, &quot;Debris
Plugging of the Emergency Core Cooling Suction Strainer&quot;).  Clearly, NRC
had identified to the industry that the potential blockage of the ECCS was a
significant safety hazard. However, the federal regulator did very little to
ensure that the industry heeded these warnings.</P>
<P>By 1989, the licensee had determined that that emergency sump drawings used
to identify screen sizes were hand drawings, not actual design prints. The hand
drawings were based on discussions with individuals involved with the root cause
analysis at the time, who eventually decided that the actual size of the screen
could not be determined.  A walkdown of the sump area in 1990 concluded that the
mesh screen size was 3/8 inches.  Connecticut Yankee then installed a chain-link
fence around containment sump area to eliminate large pieces of debris from
being thrown into the sump area.  Combined with regular inspections during each
outage, Connecticut Yankee felt that existing policies and practices were
adequate to ensure that materials that could enter through the containment sump
and clog ECCS strainers did not remain in containment. </P>
<P>In February, 1996, Connecticut Yankee completed a containment sump
operability determination on potential loss of coolant due to debris transport. 
It is apparent that Connecticut Yankee used generic utility information to
conclude operability based on the 3/8 inch mesh size.</P>
<P>In July, 1996, the NRC inspection determined that mesh screen size was
actually 1/2 inch and had a gap opening in the screen measuring 3 inches by 3
feet.  This condition alone could have prevented the effective operation of the
ECCS following a nuclear accident at the reactor. That same month, Connecticut
Yankee removed 5 fifty-five gallon drums of sludge and debris including plastic,
tie wraps, bolts and nuts, and a pencil. </P>
<P>The NRC determined that &quot;the licensee's design basis documentation book
did not have any specific design information related to the containment sump.  
In conclusion, neither the UFSAR or the licensee's design basis documentation
contained sufficient design information regarding the containment sump.&quot;&lt;18&gt;
  NRC concluded that Connecticut Yankee displayed various performance weaknesses
consisting of &quot;inadequate configuration management&quot;, &quot;less that 
aggressive actions in response to generic information&quot;, &quot;inadequate
operability determinations&quot;, and a &quot;lack of design basis information.&quot;</P>
<H3>E.  NIRS  FILES AN ALLEGATION WITH NRC </H3>
<P>In reviewing NRC Integrated Inspection Report 50-213/96-08 pertaining to
Connecticut Yankee  Containment  Sump Pump Screen Design, Nuclear Information
and Resource Service noted that the report indicated that in 1966 the licensee's
architect and engineer, Stone &amp; Webster,  proposed specific changes to the
reactor containment sump.  The report indicates that the proposed changes were
implemented by Connecticut Yankee &quot;but not reflected in design drawing
16103-59018 sheets 10 and 11.&quot;&lt;19&gt; </P>
<P>The NRC inspection report additional notes a Connecticut Yankee walkdown in
July, 1996 where a number of discrepancies identified  the misinstallation of
important features to the sump containment design including improper orientation
of the grating, missing tack welds, wrong screen mesh size, and a gap in the
mesh measuring 0.75 feet square.     </P>
<P>The concern arises with the repeated Connecticut Yankee's claims to the NRC
that  the reactor's sump was a standard design.  As previously presented, the
NRC inspection report  documents the October 13, 1982, Connecticut Yankee reply
under oath to a NRC Request for Additional Information issued under 10 CFR
50.54(f) on July 9, 1982.  The same conclusion was reached by the utility again
in 1986 after Connecticut Yankee had initiated Integrated Safety Assessment
Program (ISAP) topic 1.53, &quot;Containment Emergency Sump Performance&quot; to
resolve issues associated with Unresolved Safety Issue A-43 pertaining to
containment emergency sumps. In the completed ISAP report dated in December,
1986, Connecticut Yankee concluded that USI A-43  could be closed because it was
determined that the emergency sump utilized a standard design.</P>
<P>How could Connecticut Yankee justify closing out the unresolved safety issue
when in fact the Stone &amp; Webster design modifications had not only been
implemented, but misinstalled?  More importantly, a sworn correspondence by the
licensee constitutes a misrepresentation of material fact adversely affecting
the Emergency Core Cooling System, a vital piece of safety-related equipment. 
</P>
<P>As a result of this finding, NIRS has filed a formal allegation with the NRC
to initiate an investigation into Connecticut Yankee's treatment of this long
standing and unresolved public safety issue.</P>
<H3>III.  A NEAR MISS ACCIDENT</H3>
<P>Late in August, 1996, with the reactor in a shutdown mode, a sequence of 
events unnoticed by reactor operators occurred over a three day period brought
the Connecticut Yankee atomic power plant precariously close to a
Loss-Of-Coolant-Accident.  As the result of operator errors and inoperable
equipment, this near miss accident is of particular concern to public health and
safety, given the documented and undocumented conditions that were already
adversely affecting crucial safety systems of the reactor.  </P>
<P>While adequate core cooling was maintained throughout the event, an NRC
inspection team reviewing the accident determined that this was a significant
precursor event potentially affecting public safety by involving:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the inadvertent introduction of non-condensible nitrogen gas to the reactor
vessel which   displaced cooling water in the reactor 
</LI>
<LI> operators were unaware of the actual cooling water level in the reactor
vessel because   instrumentation (the reactor vessel level indication system and
core exit temperature   indicators) had been disconnected in preparation for a
refueling operation which was   subsequently rescheduled
</LI>
<LI> the reactor cooling system came within 52 minutes of the boiling off
temperature which   would have commenced the loss of coolant accident 
</LI>
<LI> the water level in the reactor vessel decreased to approximately 2 1/2
feet above the   point of Residual Heat Removal (RHR) pump cavitation with
possible failure
</LI>
<LI> if the nitrogen bubble had continued to grow, it would have caused
cavitation of the   RHR pump
</LI>
<LI> two important  pieces of emergency core cooling system equipment were
already   inoperable with a through-wall leak in the body of RHR heat exchanger
and a seized RHR   pump
</LI>
<LI> two inadvertent drain downs of the reactor cooling system occurred
potentially causing    RHR pump failure
</LI>
<LI> if the RHR system were lost, timely restoration of cooling water to the
reactor would   have been difficult and potentially unavailable 
</LI>
</UL>
<P>A chronology of events leading up to this dangerous condition was documented
by the NRC inspection team as follows;&lt;20&gt;  </P>
<P>August 22-   A non-licensed operator at Connecticut Yankee failed to
properly align valves while working on the Residual Heat Removal purification
system in service.  This mistake resulted in diverting approximately 500 gallons
of reactor coolant water to the refueling storage tank. </P>
<P>August 28-   Connecticut Yankee had been in the process of correcting
excessive nitrogen gas usage to the volume control tank and had isolated a path
to the Reactor Cooling System.  The licensee believed that a continuous vent had
been established and that the non-condensible gases in the upper reactor vessel
head were being vented.  A  non-licensed operator failed to follow procedure and
incorrectly opened a valve that injected both water and nitrogen gas into the
Reactor Cooling System.  When the valve was closed it did not properly seat,
allowing non-condensible nitrogen gas to continue to leak into the reactor
cooling system through a volume control tank. The nitrogen gas began to
accumulate in the reactor vessel and displace cooling water, forcing it into the
reactor pressurizer. </P>
<P>August 29-  Operators drained approximately 5000 gallons of reactor coolant
water  from the reactor cooling system to prepare for refuel activities. In
preparation to remove the reactor vessel head, operators disconnected the
reactor vessel level indicator system (RVLIS). Later in the day, the operators
implemented  a schedule change and 1000 gallons of cooling water was restored to
the reactor vessel when the decision was made to suspend refueling operation
upon notification of a joint owners' requested economic analysis of the reactor.</P>
<P>August 31-  The nitrogen bubble reached a point of equilibrium. </P>
<P>September 1-  The nitrogen  gas leakage was isolated.  RHR pump failed to
start and was determined to be seized. </P>
<P>September 4-  During a preventive maintenance activity,  operators
inappropriately diverted an additional 300 gallons of cooling water from the
Reactor Cooling System inventory to the containment sump. </P>
<P>Over the course of this extended event before the gas bubble was detected,
the water level in the reactor vessel  eventually dropped 4 1/2 feet coming to
within 2 1/2 feet of exposing the intakes for the two RHR pumps responsible for
preventing the fuel core from overheating during shutdown.    </P>
<P>The followup NRC inspection team critical of Connecticut Yankee's handling
of the accident identified many of the procedural inadequacies and failures to
follow procedures among the root causes for the event.  These operator
deficiencies and failures included  poor procedural quality, failure to
implement procedure, lack of a questioning attitude, inappropriate decisions,
lack of  instrumentation, inadequate training, poor implementation of generic
information, weak use of technical information, and inappropriate planning and
scheduling of activities without a thorough review of safety implications.
Additionally, NRC determined that essential equipment was in poor condition.
</P>
<P>Surprisingly enough, the NRC did not identify that a contributing factor to
this event was Connecticut Yankee's failure to follow the federal regulations as
specified under 10 CFR 50.59.  As stated earlier in this report, Connecticut
Yankee is required by 10 CFR 50.59 to evaluate all changes to the station's
physical configuration and condition or any changes to procedures described in
the UFSAR that govern how the plant is operated. Specifically, the licensee is
required to identify any &quot;unreviewed safety issues.&quot;  The refueling
process is described in detail in the licensee's UFSAR. Had Connecticut Yankee
fulfilled its obligation under 10 CFR 50.59, it would have identified that the
operators cannot take away reactor vessel level system instrumentation
indefinitely.  When NU postponed refueling after taking several steps including
draining the vessel and disconnecting instrumentation, they altered the
refueling protocol.   Leaving the reactor sitting in such a condition without
reactor vessel instrumentation is a graphic and disturbing example of an &quot;unreviewed
safety issue&quot; and in violation of the reactor's licensing basis.  This
event clearly demonstrated that the risk to the public does not go away just
because the reactor is shutdown, and that NU failed to properly manage that
risk. </P>
<H3>IV.  WESTINGHOUSE STEAM GENERATORS AT CONNECTICUT YANKEE</H3>
<P>Of the 5 reactors Northeast Utilities operates  four are pressurized water
reactors (Connecticut Yankee, Millstone 2 &amp; 3, and Seabrook).  The utility
also operates Millstone Unit 1 which is a General Electric Boiling Water
Reactor.  </P>
<P>Connecticut Yankee is a Westinghouse-designed pressurized water reactor
(PWR).  The fundamental characteristic of the PWR is that the reactor's primary
coolant raises steam in a heat exchanger called a &quot;steam generator.&quot;  
Each of Connecticut Yankee's four steam generators consist of a primary coolant
loop comprised of thousands of steam generator tubes directly circulating water
from the reactor under high pressure (approx. 2250 psi) and high temperature
(6000 F). The high pressure does not allow the water to boil in the primary
coolant loop thus enabling a more efficient heat transfer.  In order to be
effective heat exchangers, the tubes are 3/4 inch in diameter with the tube's
wall being as thin as a dime.  The heat is exchanged in the steam generator
where water is allowed to turn to steam though a secondary loop that exits the
reactor containment building to power the turbogenerator.  One of Connecticut
Yankee's first indications of advanced aging and serious erosion of safety
standards was the deterioration of the unit's steam generators, first indicated
by the company in January, 1986. </P>
<P>Virtually all the nuclear industry's PWRs,  including the NU units, are
experiencing this accelerating deterioration of steam generator tubes because of
susceptibility of the metal alloy used to fabricate this large component to a
routine operational environment of radiation and fatigue.  The NRC has reported
that cracking of steam generator tubes is surging in US reactors.  Cracking and
other forms of degradation have been identified by NRC as having serious safety
implications because these tubes constitute a major reactor coolant pressure
boundary. NRC continues to evaluate operational and repair criteria for damaged
steam generator tubes. However, NRC most recently documented that if as few as
15 of these tubes were to simultaneously rupture, a rapid
loss-of-coolant-accident in the reactor would outpace the Emergency Core Cooling
System (ECCS). This would result in a meltdown of the reactor core. Because the
steam generators are equipped with pressure relief valves from the secondary
loop directly to the environment, a rupture of the primary coolant loop also
results in a radioactivity release from the reactor core which bypasses the
large containment structure with significant risk of a rapidly ensuing
catastrophic accident.&lt;21&gt;  </P>
<P>The NRC has issued numerous warnings about steam generator deterioration. In
describing the situation, Commissioner Kenneth Rogers stated that &quot;Degradation
would decrease the safety margins so that in essence, we have a loaded gun, an
accident waiting to happen.&quot;&lt;22&gt;   However, current NRC requirements
and industry standards for inspecting steam generator tubes are inadequate to
detect unsafe conditions developing in nuclear power plants. The NRC admits that
neither itself nor the industry are currently able to predict how fast cracks in
tubes can grow, noting that in the duration of one 18-month operational cycle a
reactor can experience a hundred-fold increase in cracked tubes&lt;23&gt;.</P>
<P>However, the extensive repair or replacement of steam generators is a costly
burden to the PWR operator; for the larger units upwards of $300 million.  In a
competitive electricity market such a price tag can significantly affect a
utility's operation of deteriorating units.  On May 10, 1993, Connecticut Yankee
management and engineering met with the NRC and informed the regulator,</P>
<P>&quot;Current preliminary economic evaluations of the Haddam Neck plant
effectively preclude steam generator replacement.  As such, avoiding unnecessary
tube plugging (in existing steam generators) is imperative to ensure continued
operation of the Haddam Neck plant until the end of licensed life.&quot;&lt;24&gt;
 Connecticut Yankee's piecemeal actions to save money on deteriorating equipment
is viewed as part of the overall industry and regulator's &quot;cost beneficial
licensing action.&quot;  The NRC argued there was nothing to be done until the
federal agency settled the generic issues dealing with steam generator tube
repair. Consequently, after plugging a number of the deteriorated tubes, 
Connecticut Yankee went back into full power operation with its eroding steam
generators.  By early 1995, Connecticut Yankee discovered during the next
refueling outage that one of the plugged tubes in steam generator number 4 had
ruptured, apparently due to steam pressure leaking around the installed plug
repair&lt;25&gt;.  </P>
<P>Both NU and the NRC have gambled that the &quot;loaded gun&quot; would not
go off in the remaining 15 years of Connecticut Yankee' operating license.  
However, ongoing deterioration at  Connecticut Yankee and the other Northeast
Utilities PWR stations places the public health and safety at increased risk.
The problem of steam generator aging strikes at the very basis of reactor safety
at all of NU's units where a &quot;margin of safety&quot; at operating reactors
continues to erode. </P>
<H3>V. TRITIUM RELEASES INTO THE ENVIRONMENT</H3>
<P>Tritium is a radionuclide produced as a by-product of fissioning of fuel
elements in nuclear power reactors.  Tritium, the third radioactive isotope of
hydrogen, has a hazardous life of 12.5 years.  Although tritium occurs in nature
formed as a result of cosmic rays through the Earth's atmosphere, nuclear
installations are by far the largest source of radioactive hydrogen.  Tritium is
carcinogenic (causing cancer), mutagenic (causing genetic mutation), and
teratogenic (causing birth defects).  The environment and communities living
downwind or downstream of nuclear power plants can be considered to be in a &quot;tritium
effluent pathway&quot;.  Humans can be exposed to tritium through organically
bound tritium (OBT) by way of ingestion of contaminated plants and animals in a
tritium effluent pathway, in addition to direct uptake by inhalation of
tritiated water (HTO) vapor, absorption, or drinking of contaminated water or
the inhalation of tritiated gas (HT).  HTO is considered by the International
Commission On Radiological Protection (ICRP) to be 25,000 times more hazardous
in air than HT because of its mobility and uptake.   Because it is a low energy
beta emitter, tritium is very difficult to detect in air without expensive
equipment.  However while it is a &quot;weak&quot; radiocnuclide, unable to
penetrate human skin, once inside the body following the path for normal
hydrogen molecules through ingestion, inhalation, or absorbed, it can intimately
incorporate with the DNA structure of its host, causing considerable damage at
the most critical site for radiation exposure.  </P>
<P>Since no economically feasible process exists to separate and remove tritium
for regular hydrogen in the cooling water effluent at nuclear power plants, the
nuclear industry is not required to remove it.  Therefore, whatever tritium
accumulates in the cooling water is ultimately released into the environment,
either with the gaseous emissions to the atmosphere, or with liquid released to
the plant's cooling water source.  In Connecticut Yankee's case, this cooling
water source and discharge tributary is the Connecticut River.  </P>
<P>According to NRC records, Connecticut Yankee has released a total of 75,075
curies of tritium into the Connecticut River between 1974 and 1993. The Haddam
Neck reactor has the dubious distinction of releasing on the order of a
magnitude (ten times) more tritium in liquid discharges than any other nuclear
reactor in the United States including reactors twice its size.&lt;26&gt;</P>
<H3>VI. THE DECOMMISSIONING  OF CONNECTICUT YANKEE</H3>
<P>Once a decision is made to permanently close Connecticut Yankee, the issue
of what to do with the intensely radioactive facility must be addressed. This is
referred to as the decommissioning stage.  During decommissioning, the nuclear
fission reaction is stopped and the fuel is permanently removed and placed in
the fuel pool storage area, allowing that storage space has not already been
filled to capacity.  The remainder of the facility is highly radioactively
contaminated in the area of the reactor vessel. Contaminated areas must be
controlled to reduce worker exposure to radioactivity.  Under new NRC
regulations, NU has a number of options ranging from placing the defueled
reactor in storage to allow for radioactive decay or to begin the prompt
dismantlement of the nuclear station.  </P>
<P>The NRC issued its amended regulations as a final rule &quot;Decommissioning
of Nuclear Power Reactors&quot; in the Federal Register on July 29, 1996.&lt;27&gt;
  In a major change,  the amended rule now provides that nuclear power licensees
are no longer required to have an approved decommissioning plan before being
permitted to perform major decommissioning activities.  Under the new rule,
licensees are allowed to perform major decommissioning activities such as
segmentation, removal, transport, and burial of large radioactive components
(i.e. steam generators, large and small diameter piping, etc.) through the
application of 10 CFR 50.59.  The NRC has amended the 10 CFR 50.59 process to
provide the licensee with the option to include major decommissioning activities
under the same requirements as routine activities performed while the reactor
was operational.  As stated earlier in this report, the provision allows
operators to make modifications to physical features at the reactor and analysis
of safety issues, so long as the modifications do not constitute an &quot;unreviewed
safety issue.&quot;    As defined by 10 CFR 50.59, an ureviewed safety issue is
defined as any activity which increases the likelihood or consequences of a
previously evaluated accident, introduces a new type of accident or reduces
safety margins at the reactor. </P>
<P>However, in order to safely conduct any proposed activities under 10 CFR
50.59 and demonstrate that there are &quot;no unreviewed safety issues,&quot; a
licensee must have its design and licensing bases in order and updated with
regard to all previous changes to systems, structures, and components along with
any modifications made to their safety analysis. These previous modifications
are documented at a minimum through the reactor's Updated Final Safety Analysis
Report (UFSAR) and Technical Specifications. </P>
<P>As has been amply documented by this report, NU did not regard the UFSAR for
any of its Connecticut reactors as a document that was required to be accurate. 
The NRC identified in its special inspection report of July 31, 1996 that NU had
not been updating its Connecticut Yankee UFSAR. In some cases, changes were made
to the UFSAR without a 10 CFR 50.59 evaluation for &quot;unreviewed safety
issues.&quot; In other cases, changes were made to the station without even
documenting modifications in the UFSAR.  As a result, Connecticut Yankee's
design and licensing basis is in such disarray and so defective, that it can not
be solely relied upon to perform any current safety evaluations under 10 CFR
50.59 for either the purpose of restart or decommissioning.   </P>
<P>In preparation for restart, Connecticut Yankee initiated a comprehensive
Configuration Management Program (CMP) during 1996.  The CMP tasks included
reviewing all correspondence to and from the NRC to identify commitments and
then determining if these commitments were satisfied by the plant design and
operation. Safety systems were being evaluated under the CMP to determine if
these systems could adequately perform their required functions. Another CMP
task involved a major update to the UFSAR to incorporate literally hundreds of
physical changes made to the facility over the years that had not been reflected
in the plant's safety analyses.  When the recommendation to permanently close
Haddam Neck was announced in early October 1996, the CMP effort was essentially
disbanded without having completed any of its tasks.  The objective of the CMP
was to provide the necessary assurance that Haddam Neck complied with all safety
regulations prior to restarting the plant -- equal assurance is required to
ensure safety during decommissioning activities.</P>
<P>The NRC has stated in its amended decommissioning rule that the &quot;systems
required for maintaining the spent fuel in the spent fuel pool as well as the
operations required to contain the remaining residual contamination in the
facility and spent fuel pool are relatively simple.  Consequently, the
activities performed by the licensee during decommissioning do not have a
significant potential to impact public health and safety and these require
considerably less oversight by the NRC than during power operations.&quot;&lt;28&gt;
 </P>
<P>To the contrary, the authors of this report contend that NU, through its
common course of business over the operational life of the Connecticut Yankee
atomic power station and  other Connecticut reactors, has demonstrated the need
for intensified regulatory oversight of any subsequent decommissioning process
with an open and full public hearing process up front of any dismantlement or
decommissioning project. Absent an accurate updated UFSAR,  the licensee does
not have a reliable blueprint for disassembling the reactor.</P>
<H3>VII.  NRC HAS DEFERRED ITS RESPONSIBILITY TO ENFORCE REGULATIONS</H3>
<P>The fact that Connecticut Yankee is not on the NRC's Problem Plants list
despite the untimely disclosure of long-term non-conformance with safety
regulations is more evidence of the historical absence of NRC regulatory
oversight and enforcement over decades of reactor operation.   While the NRC has
conducted five evaluations of its reactor inspection program since 1989,  there
remains evidence of a serious lack of NRC regulatory oversight to prioritize
public health and safety interests over the commercial interests of the nuclear
utilities the agency is mandated to regulate.&lt;29&gt;   </P>
<P>An NRC Inspector General (OIG) report issued on May 31, 1996 revealed that
despite increased regulatory scrutiny in the form of stepped up inspections and
evaluations, the NRC staff determined that serious deficiencies persisted at
NU's Millstone units that had been identified in 1991.  The OIG reported that
the staff continued to document a general decline in the level of performance at
NU's Millstone site including failure to follow design procedures, failure to 
implement corrective actions, and failure to have operability determinations
completely incorporated into procedures.   A number of recommendations made by
managers at the NRC Division of Reactor Projects  to place Millstone on the NRC
Problem Plant Watch List are documented in the OIG inquiry.  In each instance,
the NRC Region I office failed to take action.  Eventually,  the units were
placed on the NRC Problem Plants Watch List in January, 1996.  As a result of
the OIG questioning, the NRC Executive Director of Operations, the Director of
Nuclear Reactor Regulation, and Region I Regional  Administrator admitted that
given the steady decline and poor performance indicators at the NU reactor site
, the NRC should have taken more aggressive action including placing the
reactors on the watchlist as early as 1993.  OIG additionally identified a
senior resident safety inspector at Millstone who stated in his opinion, NRC had
sufficient basis to place Millstone on the watchlist following a
safety-significant event in August, 1993 that demonstrated NU's disregard for
safety. </P>
<P>According to the OIG report, however, in 1991 NU hired corporate consultant
firm, LRS Incorporated, to develop a NU &quot;game plan&quot; to defuse negative
perceptions of the utility's poor performance being generated by the regulatory
agency with the suggestion of &quot;a full court press at all levels of NRC to
prevent the Millstone site from being placed on the troubled plant list.&quot;&lt;30&gt;
   According to the OIG interview of the NRC Region I Administrator, the plan
was made available to the NRC Regional I office, however, the Administrator
could not specifically recall from whom, when or how he had received the LRS
document or whether he subsequently discussed it with NRC staff.  The NU delay
strategy was apparently successfully until January 1996, when the units were
placed on the NRC watchlist.  </P>
<P>NU's tactics &quot;to defuse&quot; the federal regulator effectively
postponed NRC actions to uncover pervasive non-compliance with regulations
pertaining to the design and licensing bases of the reactors and take some
measure of appropriate enforcement action.  This effort was achieved at the
expense of the public's health and safety.   It is of tremendous concern that
delays in enforcement action by NRC either to bring the licensees into
compliance or permanently close the reactors constitute a serious deferral of
NRC authority to protect the public health and safety to the commercial interest
of the utility.  The public is rightfully concerned that this deferral of
enforcement action constitutes continued accommodation by the NRC of unsafe
industry practices in the economic interests of the nuclear licensees.</P>
<H3>VIII.  CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS</H3>
<P>The public health and safety is significantly jeopardized by NU's negligent
practices, harassment and intimidation of  workers who seek to reveal and
resolve safety issues,  misrepresentation of filings and incomplete
documentation to safety records at its nuclear power plants.  Evidence uncovered
by the Office of the Inspector General pointing to utility efforts orchestrated
to deliberately confound and evade effective regulation by NRC raises further
questions and concerns that the utility is unfit to operate nuclear power
plants.</P>
<P>Therefore, the following recommendations are presented:</P>
<P>1)  NU's Connecticut Yankee Atomic Power Plant must be promptly and
permanently shutdown.  </P>
<P>The NRC should immediately revoke the operating licenses for the Connecticut
Yankee.  It is not economically feasible to bring the reactor to any kind of &quot;acceptable&quot;
safety standard.   The design and licensing bases for this aging atomic power
plant is in such disarray and so defective due to poorly documented and
undocumented conditions that current safety evaluations cannot be relied upon
for restart.   During NU's common course of business at its Connecticut
reactors, the utility has demonstrated gross mismanagement, negligence to
observe safety regulations and a concerted effort to obfuscate regulatory
efforts designated to protect the public health and safety.  These repeated and
serious violations represent a  breach of conditions for  the company's
operating license. </P>
<P>2)  Similarly, the operating license for Millstone units 1, 2 and 3 should
be permanently revoked by NRC.</P>
<P>3)  Criminal investigations of NU now underway by the Department of Justice
involving allegations of deliberate withholding of information and
misrepresentation of material fact should be expanded to include potential
wrongdoing at Connecticut Yankee Atomic Power Station. </P>
<P>NRC findings revealing NU mismanagement and negligence in identifying
serious deficiencies in the CY design and licensing basis dating back to the
initial startup of the reactor raise significant questions into the accuracy and
intent of NU operability assessments. The fact that repeated opportunities were
missed by the utility to catch mistakes adversely affecting reactor safety and
the public health  raises further questions with regard to the utility's intent
comply with regulations promulgated to protect the public health and safety. 
</P>
<P>4)  With the immediate closure of the Connecticut Yankee and Millstone
units,  the NRC should intensify its regulatory oversight of any subsequent
decommissioning process which would include an open and full public hearing
process up front of any dismantlement or decommissioning activities.</P>
<P>As stated earlier, Connecticut Yankee's design and licensing bases are in
such disarray and so defective, they can not be relied upon to perform any
further safety evaluations under 10 CFR 50.59 for the purpose of 
decommissioning. Effectively, NU does not have a workable blueprint to conduct
decommissioning activities that fully regard the safety of workers,  the public
and the environment.</P>
<P>5)  Northeast Utilities must be retasked to update Connecticut Yankee's
UFSAR, discontinued with the suspension of its comprehensive Configuration
Management Program (CMP) during 1996, and incorporate all physical changes that
have been made to the facility over the years not reflected in the plant's
safety analyses. </P>
<P>6) There should be a thorough and  independent review of  the accuracy of
UFSARs for NU's Connecticut Yankee and Millstone units before any subsequent
major activity such as decommissioning. </P>
<P>7)   A comprehensive review should be completed of  the NRC inspection
process under the auspices of the Office of the Inspector General to determine
how the NRC's  regulatory oversight missed the long-standing  problems at
Connecticut Yankee. The review should address inspection and oversight issues at
the levels of on-site inspectors, NRC Regional I Administration Office and the
Project Manager Office at NRC Headquarters in Rockville, Maryland.</P>

<P>Mr. James Taylor,</P>
<P>Executive Director of Operations</P>
<P>U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission</P>
<P>Washington, DC 20555</P>
<P><B>PETITION FOR ENFORCEMENT, PURSUANT TO 10 CFR 2.206, TO REVOKE NORTHEAST
UTILITIES/ OPERATING LICENSES FOR THE CONNECTICUT NUCLEAR POWER STATIONS DUE TO
CHRONIC, SYSTEMIC MISMANAGEMENT RESULTING IN SIGNIFICANT VIOLATIONS OF NRC
SAFETY REGULATIONS, AND TO INVESTIGATE THE NRC STAFF'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR NOT
DEALING WITH THIS PROBLEM FOR OVER A DECADE</B></P> 
<P><B>I. SUMMARY  RATIONALE  FOR  REQUESTED  ACTIONS</B></P>
<P>In the interest of public health and safety,  Citizens Awareness Network
(CAN) and Nuclear Information and Resource Service (NIRS), petition the United
States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC),  pursuant to 10 CFR  2.206,  to
suspend or revoke Northeast Utilities' (NU) licenses to operate the Millstone
Units 1, 2, 3, and Connecticut Yankee nuclear power stations due to over a
decade of chronic, systemic mismanagement and violations of NRC regulations that
have jeopardized occupational and public health and safety.</P>
<P><B>II. REQUESTED  ENFORCEMENT  ACTIONS</B></P>
<P>A.Petitioners request that the NRC take the following actions to enforce its
regulations against Northeast Utilities:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Petitioners request that the NRC immediately suspend or revoke Northeast
Utilities' license to operate the Connecticut Yankee and Millstone nuclear
reactors due to chronic, negligent management of the reactors which, for over a
decade, has endangered and continues to endanger occupational and public health
and safety and the environment due to resultant and cumulative major safety
problems and violations of NRC regulations.
</LI>
<LI>Petitioners request that the NRC investigate the possibility that NU made
material misrepresentations to the NRC concerning engineering calculations and
other information or actions relied upon to assure the adequacy of safety
systems at Connecticut Yankee and Millstone reactors, said possible material
misstatements due to a lack of rigor and thoroughness, or as a result of
providing intentionally  misleading information.
</LI>
<LI>In the event that an investigation determines that Northeast Utilities
deliberately provided insufficient and/or false or misleading information to the
NRC, petitioners request that the NRC revoke Northeast Utilities' operating
licenses for the Connecticut Yankee and Millstone Unit 1, 2 and 3 reactors.  If
the NRC chooses not to revoke the Northeast Utilities' licenses, the 
Petitioners specifically request that the reactors remain off-line until a
United States Department of Justice independent investigation is complete and
the NRC reviews conclusions and recommendations contained therein for  potential
consequences to the licensee and its agents under NRC regulations.</LI>
</OL>
<P>4.In the event that the NRC chooses not to revoke Northeast Utilities'
license to operate Connecticut Yankee and the Millstone Unit 1, 2, and 3
reactors and allows the reactors to return to operation,  petitioners request
that the reactors remain on the NRC 'watch list' to oversee reactor operations
until such time as NU management demonstrates to the NRC?s satisfaction that:</P>
<P>a. NU is able to fulfill NRC regulatory requirements;</P>
<P>b. NU has met all prior commitments concerning the repair, modification,
maintenance, and documentation of the nuclear power stations;</P>
<P>c. NU has retrained all staff in the application and interpretation of NRC's
regulations; and</P>
<P>d. NU has removed from any positions of responsibility for operation and/or
management of the reactors any and all persons whom the Department of Justice,
NRC, or other government investigators and/or civil or criminal prosecutions
find to have made material misrepresentations to the NRC during the past decade
of mismanagement.</P>
<P>5. The Petitioners request that, at a minimum, the NRC keep Connecticut
Yankee and the Millstone Units 1, 2, and 3 nuclear reactors off-line until the
NU's chronic mismanagement has been analyzed, remedial management programs put
into effect, and the NRC has evaluated and approved the effectiveness of the
licensee's actions.  At a minimum, this should entail:</P>
<P>a. A thorough analysis of root causes for deficiencies in NU?s FSARs,
documentation for licensing and design basis, safety analyses, engineering,
quality assurance, ALARA programs, and other necessary or required
documentation;</P>
<P>b. Creation of a complete, accurate, updated FSAR--mere 'reform' is
impossible when the basic document is inadequate and inaccurate;</P>
<P>c. Re-evaluation of any of NU's activities initiated under (or which NU
should have initiated under) l0 CFR 50.59 in order to confirm the validity of
such activities, particularly to determine the extent to which the  updated FSAR
does not match 'as built' reactor configurations.  This requires more than a
mere paper audit, and necessitates a component-by-component and system-by-system
check of the actual physical plant against the existing documentation, and the
creation of correct documentation where it is lacking and/or inadequate;</P>
<P>d. Institution and documentation of an effective ALARA review for all
operational and non-operational activities which expose or potentially expose
workers and/or the public to radiation;</P>
<P>e. Thorough documentation of the root causes of NU's chronic and systemic
mismanagement--including documentation of the NRC Region I inspection program?s
staff and management failures over the past decade to detect and deal with this
problem; f. That NU demonstrates, over a substantial period of time to the
satisfaction of the NRC,  NU's commitment to respect NRC regulatory requirements
and consistently put them into practice;</P>
<P>g. NU retrains all personnel involved in day-to-day operations so that they
are thoroughly conversant with NRC regulations;</P>
<P>h. Updating and documentation of Plant Design Changes Requests to include
all changes to the reactor's design, and that these design changes are verified
by the NRC staff, with close-outs of PDCRs receiving the highest priority;</P>
<P>B. Petitioners request that, in the event that NU decides to shut-down any
or all of the nuclear power reactors at issue herein with the intent to commence
the decommissioning process, the NRC does not permit any decommissioning or
pre-decommissioning activity to take place until such time as:</P>
<OL>
<LI>All of the documentation mentioned above is available to the NRC and
on-site at the reactors;
</LI>
<LI>All personnel involved in the decommissioning process have been retrained
(or trained) in the use and interpretation of the applicable NRC regulations
contained in Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations;
</LI>
<LI>The NRC appropriately evaluates, replaces personnel, and restructures the
NRC Region I inspection program, its management and the supervising NRC
directorate to eliminate the regulatory anarchy that plagued the Connecticut
nuclear reactors during the past ten years;
</LI>
<LI>The NRC makes certain that NU does not employ any persons in management or
operations who made material misrepresentations to the NRC about the status of
operations, repairs, modifications, or maintenance of NU's Connecticut reactors.
</LI>
</OL>
<P>C. Petitioners request that the NRC commences an investigation into how it
allowed the illegal situation at NUs Connecticut reactors to exist and continue
for over a decade. Particularly, petitioners request that the Commission orders
its staff (directors of the responsible directorates, managers, Region I
management and staff) to answer the following questions, and hold these persons
accountable for their answers and actions regarding the past 10 years at NU's
Connecticut nuclear power reactors:</P>
<OL>
<LI>What documents did Region I inspectors, their supervisors, and NRC
directorate oversight review during ten years of NU's out-of-compliance
operation?
</LI>
<LI>If NU provided documents that somehow deceived the Region I inspectors, how
does the information in these documents relate to the actual everyday workings
and activities conducted during the otherwise undocumented decade of operations
at the Millstones and Connecticut Yankee?
</LI>
<LI>How did Region I inspectors, their supervisors, and NRC directorate
oversight find that NU was conducting operations in a way that keeps worker and
public exposures to radiation As Low As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA) when NU
was not adequately documenting either its licensing bases or the basis of
reactor operations?
</LI>
<LI>Knowing, as Region I inspectors must have known, of excessive worker
exposures--for example, due to a long standing problem with leaking pipes as
documented by an NU worker in the video tape provided with this petition Exhibit
A--how did the Region I inspectors certify that operations at the Millstones and
Connecticut Yankee were being conducted ALARA?  How did their supervisors, and
those in the NRC directorate, make the same certifications?
</LI>
<LI>During the undocumented decade, how did Region I inspectors, their
supervisors, and NRC directorate oversight manage to track NU?s activities at
the Millstones and Connecticut Yankee under 10 CFR 50.59?
</LI>
<LI>To what extents have NRC Region I inspectors, their supervisors, and NRC
directorate oversight allowed the same type of problems to develop at other
nuclear power reactors in New England (i.e., Maine Yankee, Pilgrim, Seabrook,
Vermont Yankee, and Yankee Rowe)?
</LI>
<LI>Is there any connection between licensees employing Yankee Atomic Electric
Company's consulting and engineering services and the existence of serious
problems with documentation and lack of compliance with licensing and design
bases at any New England area nuclear power stations or those in other parts of
the country?
</LI>
</OL>
<P><B>III. RATIONALES  FOR  REQUESTED ACTIONS</B></P>
<P>For the past decade, NU mismanagement of the Millstone and Connecticut
Yankee nuclear power stations has compromised the health and safety of workers
and the public by subjecting them to increased risks of radiation exposure and
the uncertainties of actual exposures on a daily basis, as well as subjecting
them to an increased risk of death and illness during and following a major
nuclear accident.  During that period of time, NU has operated the Connecticut
nuclear power stations in flagrant disregard of fundamental NRC regulations
designed to assure that workers and the public are adequately protected from
such risks.  NU violated NRC regulations, despite a continuing responsibility to
assure the safety of the most vulnerable members of the public (i.e., citizens
living near the reactors, within the effluent pathways, and all those within a
fifty mile radius of the reactors), protect NU workers, and safeguard its own
assets (as a fiduciary obligation to its shareholders).</P>
<P>Over and over, during the decade of mismanagement, NU promised NRC Region I
inspectors, their supervisors, and NRC directorate oversight that it would
fulfill its obligations under NRC's regulations.  NU's unfulfilled
commitments--in writing, orally, and even under oath--include, but are not
limited to, promises that NU would: (1) correct mistakes in reports and
procedures, (2) correct mechanical and engineering deficiencies, (3) repair or
replace equipment, (4) maintain and/or upgrade safety systems, (5) conduct
engineering and documentation evaluations under 10 CFR 50.59 to justify tests,
modifications, experiments, or changes made to any portion of the Connecticut
reactors, and (6) maintain complete and proper documentation on the required
safety systems of the reactor, its general operation, and technical
specifications.  These acts and omissions are, at a minimum, violations of 10
CFR 50.4, 50.5, 50.59 and 50.71.</P>
<P>Safe operation of a reactor necessitates that a licensee (such as NU)
maintain a properly documented and completely updated Final Safety Analysis
Report (FSAR), and routinely conduct full engineering and documentation reviews,
pursuant to 10 CFR 50.59 on proposed changes, tests, or experiments conducted in
the course of any and all operations. See, e.g., 10 CFR 50.4, 50.59, 50.71.  The
implications of failing to meet such basic requirements are staggering.</P>
<P>The effectiveness of multiple back-up safety systems which the NRC requires
of licensees under the 'defense in depth' program approach, and basic
assumptions relied upon in every probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) utilized to
predict the degree of assurance provided by such safety systems, are swept away
like a house of cards when a licensee (such as NU) operates without adequate
documentation.  This is more than mere paper shuffling.  If it were just a
matter of giving NU a bit more time to gather papers, the Commission could let
NRC Region I take the usual casual approach.</P>
<P>However, the Region I casual approach to auditing operations at NU
facilities permitted NU over a decade of operating and profiting from its
Connecticut nuclear power stations without adequate evidence that operations met
NRC regulations.  A lack of documentation directly translates into a continuous
elevated risk of radiation exposure to NU workers and the public, an unknown and
yet to be determined amount of increased radiation exposure to workers, and a
continuing risk that a combination of operator error and safety system failure
will result in a major nuclear accident.</P>
<P>NU's Event Response team told NU, as the NRC now knows, that during the past
decade NU did not maintain the required documentation at the Millstone Unit 1
nuclear station.  The NRC has since learned of the same shoddy practices at the
other Millstone reactors and Connecticut Yankee (Haddam Neck).  This is a large
part of the reason why petitioners have requested the NRC to take immediate
action to halt all operations at the Millstone facilities until the required
documentation is on file.  NU's Event Response team told NU that:</P>
<P>&quot;Most of the engineers and managers contacted during [the Event
Response Team analysis] (individuals who should be well-versed in design control
requirements) have not read Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations [NRC
Regulations], Regulatory Guides, or ANSI Standard pertinent to design control. 
There is a general lack of understanding and appreciation of the relationship
and implications between 10 CFR 50, design basis (50.2), licensing basis,
industry codes, and NU's administrative programs controlling configuration and
design [of reactor operations].&quot;</P>
<P>Event Response Team, Executive Summary at 11. The Event Response team report
also states that:</P>
<P>&quot;Internal correspondence and events involving the design basis [e.g.
NOVs, DERs, LERs] from 1985 through 1996 show a pattern of information
communicated to NU management.  This information consistently identified
weaknesses and risks associated with the UFSAR [updated FSAR] and design basis.&quot;</P>
<P>Id. at 2  This means that NU management had concrete particularized
knowledge of serious on-going violations of NRC regulations.  The Event Response
Team Report further states that:</P>
<P>&quot;NU management made commitments on the docket to correct these
deficiencies.  The actions [of NU management] were ineffective, partially
implemented, or not done.&quot;</P>
<P>Id. This means that although NU management had concrete, particularized
knowledge of serious on-going safety violations of NRC regulations, it  either
acted ineffectively or did nothing at all.  Therefore, it is axiomatic that when
NU management knowingly led the NRC to believe that NU was taking effective
action to come into compliance, or was in compliance with NRC safety
regulations, NU was making material misrepresentations to the NRC, 
misrepresentations directly related to the safe management, maintenance,
inspection, repair and operation of the Connecticut Yankee and Millstone
facilities under the terms and conditions of NRC's license to NU to operate
these nuclear power stations. Over and above all the underlying violations of
other portions of 10 CFR part 50 leading up to them, in and of themselves, such
material misrepresentations violate NRC regulation 10 CFR 50.5 (deliberate
misconduct), 50.54 (conditions of license), 50.55a(a)(1) (requirement to meet
codes and standards), and 50.71(e) (requirement to update FSAR and maintain
50.59 documentation).  Although NU merely intended that the Event Response Team
Report would  identify problems at Millstone Unit 1, the Report stated that:</P>
<P>The long term pattern of decisions and actions [at Millstone Unit 1] has
generic implications for Connecticut Yankee and Millstone Units 2 and 3.  A
sample of internal and external assessments and design events (e.g., LERs) for
Units 2 and 3 and Connecticut Yankee, supports the potential for generic
implications.</P>
<P>Id. at 8 (emphasis added).  The Report goes on to state that the Team needed
more data from each of the NU licensed facilities mentioned in order to
determine the &quot;full extent of the implications.&quot; Id.   Thus, NU?s own
investigative team, without even having a complete picture of the extent to
which the problems at Millstone Unit 1 apply to other NU operated nuclear
reactors, recommended that NU should &quot;conduct a verification effort similar
to the Millstone Unit 1 effort for Millstone Units 2 and 3 and Connecticut
Yankee.&quot; Id. at 9.</P>
<P>Beyond the efforts that the NRC has already taken to try to deal with the
problems described in NU's in-house report, the Commission needs to direct its
independent panel to examine each of the NOVs, DERs, and LERs over the past
decade to determine the actual physical status and documentation for all of the
problems (and any of the changes, modifications, tests) at all of the Millstones
and Connecticut Yankee, as well as the rest of the New England
reactors--certainly any in which NU has an interest, as well as those serviced
by NU's primary engineering contractors and consultants--and probably all of the
nuclear power stations inspected by Region I.</P>
<P>This petition calls upon the Commission to face reactor licensee violations
more pervasive and serious than any previously confronting the NRC.  Not only do
the decade-long, serious, chronic, systemic mismanagement problems at the
Millstone and Connecticut Yankee nuclear power stations require action against
NU, but the Commission must confront its own chronic, systemic failure to
enforce its regulations.  Specifically, the blatant, abject failure of
regulatory oversight by the NRC NRR directorate management and staff, NRC Region
I management, staff, inspectors, and other NRC administrators, management, and
staff in failing to assure NU's compliance with NRC regulations.</P>
<P>In the event that the NRC determines that the root causes of Northeast
Utilities' chronic, systemic mismanagement of its Connecticut nuclear reactors
has jeopardized public health and safety, petitioners have requested the
revocation or suspension of Northeast Utilities' licenses to operate these
facilities until such time as the NRC Commissioners have reviewed and approved
the recommendation of an independent panel appointed by the Commission that
unequivocally recommends re-licensing or lifting the suspension.</P>
<P>In the event that the NRC determines that its staff (NRR, Region I, and any
other NRC personnel involved) has systematically failed to enforce regulations,
not carried out inspections which assured the completion of documentation,
repairs, upgrades, maintenance, ALARA reviews and procedures, and any activities
which licensees promised to accomplish pursuant to regulation or best practices,
petitioners have requested that all such personnel be permanently removed from
any positions involving oversight authority in reviewing, directing, supervising
or carrying-out the NRC's regulatory requirements.</P>
<P>The bottom line on the failures of NU and NRC inspections described in this
petition and the video Exhibit attached hereto is that these failures culminate
in NU's Connecticut nuclear power stations having inconsistent and inaccurate
Final Safety Analysis Reports.</P>
<P>The updated FSAR is the essential document for safe reactor operations. The
FSAR demonstrates licensee compliance with NRC regulatory requirements by
documenting all changes to a reactor from construction through operations and
for the duration of the license.  Along with the Technical Specifications, the
FSAR provides a working blueprint against which a licensee may compare the
day-to-day condition of the facility.  This allows the licensee to be relatively
certain that the reactor is operating safely, and efficiently plan for continued
safe operation.  By documenting modifications and repairs to a reactor, the FSAR
allows a licensee to determine the need for additional design modifications and
plan for necessary repairs and maintenance.  In this way, the FSAR provides
managers and engineers with a guide to determine how to retrain the work force. 
By encapsulating the history of physical modifications, repairs, and
maintenance, the FSAR also protects workers from unnecessary exposure to
radiation.  It does this by providing a guide for licensees during the planning
and reviewing process necessary to implement the NRC?s mandatory ALARA standards
in 10 CFR part 50 and Appendix I.</P>
<P>Because the FSAR is the blueprint which documents the history of changes to
a reactor and its operation, consistent, timely updating is absolutely
essential.</P>
<P>The updated FSAR allows the licensee to maintain knowledge of the current
condition of reactor operations, make information accessible to reactor staff,
and allows staff to effectively handle both routine operations and abnormal
events.</P>
<P>In the absence of an updated and accurate FSAR, nuclear power station
managers, engineers, staff, employees and contractors lack information on how
the reactor systems and components operate together.  Changes occurring in the
reactor design become difficult, if not impossible, to determine, and require
case-specific investigation based upon inherently unreliable sources:
individual, anecdotal memory.  Likewise, absent an adequate, updated FSAR,
discovering the impacts of design changes upon other systems requires such
time-consuming, case-specific investigation.  Under emergency conditions, it
would be impossible for operators, engineers, and staff to immediately access
the exact cause of a problem or understand the conditions they would find when
attempting to make emergency repairs.  A time-consuming, case-specific
investigative process confronts staff precisely at the moment of crisis, when
time is of the essence to avoid catastrophe.</P>
<P>A deficient FSAR prevents a licensee from adequately training and retraining
workers.  By having different and conflicting updates of the FSAR, workers may
respond to the wrong condition or at a wrong location, leading to confusion and
conflict in addressing both standard operation and abnormal occurrences.  To the
extent that the deficient FSAR forces workers to rely on inherently unreliable
anecdotal knowledge, such conflicts multiply as different managers, engineers,
and operators recall different versions of what was done, where, how, and by
whom.  In an emergency situation, under these conditions, coordinated efforts by
personnel are exceedingly difficult if not impossible.</P>
<P>Clearly, the anecdotal, case-by-case scenario for problem solving increases
the likelihood of unnecessary worker exposure to radiation.  Personnel cannot
practice a &quot;lessons learned&quot; approach to problems under such
conditions. The possibility of personnel conducting ALARA analyses is completely
compromised under such conditions.  Absence of an updated FSAR forces workers to
constantly reinvent the wheel whenever problem situations confront them in areas
of radioactive contamination.  This directly translates into workers routinely
exposed to higher doses of radiation than they would incur under proper ALARA
practices.</P>
<P>Finally, and most significantly, absence of a properly updated FSAR forces
the nuclear power station operators and other staff to function in a constant
reactive or &quot;crisis&quot; mode.  The result is personnel exercising poor
judgment, suffering from excess stress, and making inferior decisions.  This
translates into higher employee absenteeism, higher turn-over, and lost
experience.  In this way, the demands placed upon operators and staff by the
necessity of maintaining a high level of scrutiny of worn and out-dated
components and systems in an aging reactor are compound by the problems created
when attempting to conduct operations with a deficient FSAR.  Ultimately, under
such conditions, engineers will find it more and more difficult to effectively
calculate and set conservative limits on already deteriorating systems.  This
way, the process of deterioration will accelerate, eventually spiraling out of
control.</P>
<P>Workers' and the public's health and safety are in constant jeopardy when
the NRC allows licensees to operate nuclear reactors without an updated FSAR.</P>
<P>Absent an updated, accurate FSAR, NRC inspectors have no way to determine
that a reactor is in compliance with regulations and technical specifications.</P>
<P>For these reasons, and in order to avoid the anarchic situations described
above, the NRC makes a licensee's commitments to maintain an accurate and
updated FSAR (and other necessary documentation) binding, legal requirements
under NRC regulations:</P>
<P>Each person licensed to operate a nuclear power reactor pursuant to the
provisions of Sec. 50.21 or Sec. 50.22 of this part shall update periodically,
as provided in paragraphs (e) (3) and (4) of this section, the final safety
analysis report (FSAR) originally submitted as part of the application for the
operating license, to assure that the information included in the FSAR  contains
the latest material developed.  This submittal shall contain all the changes
necessary to reflect information and analyses submitted to the Commission by the
licensee or prepared by the licensee pursuant to Commission requirement since
the submission of the original FSAR or, as appropriate, the last updated FSAR.
The updated FSAR shall be revised to include the effects of: all changes made in
the facility or procedures as described in the FSAR; all safety evaluations
performed by the licensee either in support of requested license amendments or
in support of conclusions that changes did not involve an unreviewed safety
question; and all analyses of new safety issues performed by or on behalf of the
licensee at Commission request.  The updated information shall be appropriately
located within the FSAR.</P>
<P>(1) The licensee shall submit revisions containing updated information to
the Commission, as specified in Sec. 50.4, on a replacement-page basis that is
accompanied by a list which identifies the current pages of the FSAR following
page replacement.</P>
<P>(2) The submittal shall include (i) a certification by a duly authorized
officer of the licensee that either the information accurately presents changes
made since the previous submittal, necessary to reflect information and analyses
submitted to the Commission or prepared pursuant to Commission requirement, or
that no such changes were made; and (ii) an identification of changes made under
the provisions of Sec. 50.59 but not previously submitted to the Commission.</P>
<P>(3)(i) A revision of the original FSAR containing those original pages that
are still applicable plus new replacement pages shall be filed within 24 months
of either July 22, 1980, or the date of issuance of the operating license,
whichever is later, and shall bring the FSAR up to date as of a maximum of 6
months prior to the date of filing the revision.</P>
<P>. . . .</P>
<P>(4) Subsequent revisions shall be filed no less frequently than annually and
shall reflect all changes up to a maximum of 6 months prior to the date of
filing.</P>
<P>. . . .</P>
<P>10 CFR 50.71(e) (emphasis added).  The rule makes patently clear the NRC's
concern (and requirement!) that licensees have both updated FSAR and 50.59
analyses on hand.</P>
<P>Without an updated FSAR in place, NRC staff had (and have) no basis for
determining whether NU was in compliance with its technical specifications and
NRC safety regulations.</P>
<P>Thus, to the extent that NU failed to provide, and NRC staff failed to
demand, an up-to-date and accurate FSAR for the Millstones and Connecticut
Yankee,  the NRC staff permitted NU to operate the reactors out of compliance
with technical specifications and in violation of crucial NRC safety
regulations.</P>
<P>Recent NRC action has taken some initiative in attempting to isolate NRC
Region I from a continuing role overseeing inspections of NU's nuclear
facilities in Connecticut.  While this is a beginning, it is hardly comforting
to members of  CAN and NIRS living throughout New England, where NRC Region I
has supposedly been inspecting other nuclear power stations.  What assurance, if
any, is there that NRC Region I has been vigilant outside Connecticut when it
has so totally failed to do its job there?</P>
<P>The Commission needs to conduct an audit of all NRC Region I inspections and
NRC headquarters oversight of these inspections during the past decade to see if
there are the same type of negligent inspection practices throughout NRC Region
I as those documented in Connecticut and Maine.  Moreover, to date, the
licensee's responses have been insufficient.  DERs, inspection reports, and
other documents---as petitioners illustrate below---show an increasing number of
serious problems emerging at an alarming rate.  This means that NU has failed to
address the root causes of the problems at the Millstones and Connecticut
Yankee, and is merely attempting a cosmetic fix.  To do the job right, the NRC
must initiate a full-scale independent analysis of all reactor systems at NU's
Connecticut facilities.</P>
<P>Even if NU decides to permanently close one of these nuclear reactors--as
likely it will do with Connecticut Yankee--without such a massive audit and
re-documentation, it would be unsafe to attempt to disassemble any portion of a
nuclear power station. This is because an updated FSAR provides a blueprint for
safe decommissioning.  The same applies to the licensee having complete,
accurate, and up-to-date 10 CFR 50.59 documentation.  Absent these documents,
there are no &quot;specs&quot; for a nuclear power station.  No meaningful ALARA
analysis and review can take place.  Thus, decommissioning workers could easily
receive extremely serious radiation exposures by entering highly contaminated
areas of the plant, attempting to remove the wrong component, or attempting to
undertake decontamination activities in a highly contaminated section of the
facility.  Furthermore, and fundamentally, without the proper documentation,
workers have no way of knowing how the nuclear power station was put together,
so they cannot possibly take it apart safely.</P>
<P>The NRC must determine the root causes of such chronic, systemic
mismanagement, because the recognized deficiencies presage potential widespread
mismanagement compromising safe reactor operation.  This applies with no less
force to the same deficiencies in NRC regulatory oversight.  The lack of
documentation, inaccuracies in existing documents, and other serious lapses have
occurred over decades, making it difficult to verify system compliance--whether
one looks at the individual nuclear reactors at issue here, or the NRC Region I
inspection program as a whole.</P>
<P>The NRC ordered a Connecticut Yankee shutdown because NU was operating the
reactor outside technical specifications.  The NRC's shutdown decision followed
a series of NRC inspections and reportable event occurrences [documented in
DERs] at the reactor. Among other safety problems, the inspections uncovered
serious weaknesses and inaccuracies in NU?s documentation for operating
Connecticut Yankee, particularly NU's failure to maintain an accurate and
completely updated Final Safety Analysis Report [FSAR].  The same problem
existed at Millstone Unit 1,  where NU's own in-house evaluation team found that
management and engineering personnel were not familiar with the NRC safety
regulations contained in Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations.</P>
<P>The NU evaluation team also reported that Millstone Unit 1 management
carelessly or knowingly neglected to follow-through on mandatory commitments to
the NRC staff to assure that particular repairs, modifications, and
documentation of changes to the reactor were actually taking place.  The same NU
evaluation team raised serious questions about mismanagement of Millstone Units
2, 3, and Connecticut Yankee.</P>
<P><B>IV. CHRONIC, SYSTEMIC PROBLEMS AT NU'S CONNECTICUT REACTORS</B></P>
<P>Petitioners contend that NU's Connecticut nuclear power reactors do not
exhibit substantial improvement, despite NU's recent efforts to get them back on
line. Management and operation at NU's Connecticut reactors continue to be
dangerous, substandard, and generally outside NRC's regulations, as the examples
cited herein illustrate.  Petitioners believe that NU's admitted decade-long
failure to maintain an updated FSAR for each reactor facility epitomizes the
seriousness of the current state of affairs at the Connecticut reactors.</P>
<P>Petitioners have assembled but a few of the incredibly numerous inspection
reports, internal review documents, and licensee event reports  for each of NU's
Connecticut reactors. These documents raise serious concerns about the
management and operation of Connecticut Yankee and the Millstone Units I, II, &amp;
III nuclear power stations. In a letter to T. Feigenbaum, Chief Nuclear Officer
for NU, William Russell, then NRC Director of Nuclear Reactor Regulation stated:</P>
<P>&quot;The team identified a number of significant deficiencies in the
engineering calculations and analysis relied upon to ensure the adequacy of the
design of key systems at Haddam Neck [Connecticut Yankee]. In some cases,
design-basis calculations and analyses were not sufficient to confirm that the
safety system functional requirements would be met.  Some of these errors were
long-standing, while others were recently introduced....  Deficiencies were
identified in the calculations and analyses supporting the station batteries,
the emergency diesel generators..., containment air recirculation ... system,
service water ... system, and in the combination of systems and components
needed to support the emergency cooling system ... transfer from the injection
phase to sump recirculation.</P>
<P>. . . .</P>
<P>These deficiencies revealed significant weaknesses in the defense-in-depth
principles that the NRC relies on to ensure nuclear power plant operation does
not jeopardize the health and safety of the public. The team concluded that
weaknesses in your configuration management processes and a lack of technical
rigor, thoroughness, and attention to detail in the design process, either
contributed to or directly caused the identified errors.  In addition, design
control measures such as supervisory reviews, independent design reviews, and
reviews by oversight committees did not identify these deficiencies.</P>
<P>Inspection Report 50-213/96-201.&quot;  The team identified several errors
in the updated Final Safety Analyses Report (UFSAR) which reflected programmatic
weakness in the process for maintaining the accuracy and consistency of the
information in the UFSAR.  The team also found instances where NU's managers did
not meet commitments to the NRC:</P>
<P>&quot;The team found several instances involving the failure to identify,
evaluate, and correct conditions adverse to quality and some instances in which
planned corrective actions were not promptly initiated. In some instances the
delays in initiating planned corrective actions were significant because the
actions included the evaluation of the potential generic implications of these
issues for other plant systems and equipment.&quot;</P>
<P>Id.  The inspection report goes on to note that the February 22, 1996, Event
Response Team Report found process issues at Connecticut Yankee similar to those
identified at Millstone 1:</P>
<P>&quot;[T]he team found that calculations did not exist to support some of
the design-bases and the administrative control programs at Haddam Neck
[Connecticut Yankee] had not maintained an accurate UFSAR....</P>
<P>[L]icensee management oversight did not identify and address the patterns of
corrective action program implementation problems.... &quot;a general lack of
understanding and appreciation for the relationship between 10 CFR 50,
design-bases, licensing bases, industry codes, and NU's administrative programs
existed.&quot;</P>
<P>Id. Discussing Connecticut Yankee, NRC's Director of Division of Reactor
Projects told NU that:</P>
<P>&quot;The discovery by design engineering that the service water piping
supplying cooling water to the CAR fans would not remain functional under
accident conditions was an example of an issue for which the design basis for
the plant had not been thoroughly reviewed or understood.&quot;</P>
<P>R. Cooper II, NRC, letter to T. Feigenbaum, NU (September 12, 1996)
(emphasis added).  Other design basis issues discussed in the report included
the reliance on high containment back pressure to assure reliable performance of
the residual heat removal (RHR) system under postulated accident conditions and
the adequacy of the containment sump screens to limit debris from entering the
safety systems. These issues adversely impact the operability of emergency core
cooling systems, thus undermining &quot;defense in depth&quot; against a core
melt-down and the ensuing catastrophic release of radioactivity into the
environment.  The report identified these ultimate safety concerns as but two &quot;apparent&quot;
violations of technical specifications.</P>
<P><B>A. Inadequate Surveillance Testing</B></P>
<P>MP1 DER 30821 (08/01/96) involving inadequate NPSH for the RHR pump during
the long term cooling phase of an accident.  The intent of the surveillance
testing program for safety related equipment is to assure that these components
will fulfill their required functions in an emergency.  This DER demonstrates
that the MP1 surveillance testing program was deficient.</P>
<P>MP2 DER 31196 (10/22/96) involving non-conservative reactor trip setpoints. 
The purpose of the surveillance testing program for safety related instruments
is to assure that these components will perform as assumed in accident analyses.
This DER demonstrates that the MP2 surveillance testing program was deficient
and the plant safety analyses were invalid.</P>
<P>MP2 DER 30393 (05/01/96) involving a 32' x 9' hole (roughly the size of a
large doggie door) in the auxiliary building wall near the spent fuel pool. 
This deficiency, reported as having existed for some time, demonstrates a
significant deficiency in the surveillance testing program.  Ignoring the fact
that one might reasonably be expected to notice a gaping 32' x 9' hole, the
auxiliary building is intended to be a radiologically controlled area and as
such is subject to periodic testing.  The auxiliary building is, or should have
been, pressure tested to confirm that all releases are controlled and filtered
as necessary.  Such testing, had NU conducted it properly, should have detected
problems reflective of a gaping hole.</P>
<P>MP3 31052 (09/24/96) involving nuclear instrumentation high power reactor
trip testing not conforming to design and licensing bases assumptions.  The
intent of the surveillance testing program for safety related instruments is to
assure that these components will perform as assumed in accident analyses.  This
DER demonstrates that the MP3 surveillance testing program was deficient and the
plant safety analyses were invalid.</P>
<P><B>B. Operating Outside Design Bases</B></P>
<P>MP1 DER 30821 (08/01/96) involving inadequate NPSH for the RHR pump during
the long term cooling phase of an accident.  This deficiency, apparently
existing for years, meant that the reactor core would not have maintained
adequate cooling following an accident.  Since the RHR pumps also provide
suppression pool cooling (containment cooling), this deficiency could also cause
containment failure following an accident.</P>
<P>MP2 DER 31167 (10/16/96) involving flooding of the emergency diesel
generator rooms through a common, connected floor drain line.   This deficiency,
apparently existing since the plant initially started up, represents a potential
failure mechanism for all of the emergency diesel generators.  Many other
licensees, during the course of their Appendix R fire protection evaluations or
in response to the Surry pipe rupture event in 1984, identified common floor
drain line vulnerabilities such as reported in this DER.  This DER demonstrates
that the operational experience review program, mandated by the NRC following
the TMI accident, is inadequate at Millstone.</P>
<P>MP2 DER 31085 (10/03/96) involving improper setting of the steam generator
safety relief valves.  This deficiency, apparently existing since the plant
initially started up and made worse by the steam generator replacements,
represents the potential for over pressurizing the steam generators, thereby
invalidating the assumptions that a single tube rupture would not propagate. 
This DER demonstrates, among other things, that Millstone's design modification
process is deficient because NU replaced the steam generators without detecting
the existing problem or recognizing that the new steam generators would make the
problem worse.</P>
<P>MP2 DER 30350 (04/23/96) involving a single failure that could render the
enclosure building ventilation system inoperable.  Plant safety analyses assume
that one of the two redundant ventilation paths functions to filter containment
releases. This deficiency, apparently existing for considerable time, challenges
that assumption.</P>
<P>MP3 DER 31081 (10/02/96) involving a spent fuel pool design problem that
could cause loss of spent fuel pool cooling after a seismic event.  The NRC
issued NRC Information Notice No. 93-81 in October 1993 alerting licensees to
potential loss of spent fuel pool cooling following design bases events.  This
DER demonstrates that Millstone's operational experience review program,
mandated by the NRC following the TMI accident, is inadequate.</P>
<P>MP3 DER 31062 (09/26/96) involving potential failure of 21 safety related
air operated valves on loss of power causing diversion of safety injection flow
and possible pump run-out.  NRC Bulletin 88-xx specifically requires licensees
to review the performance of safety related components for loss of instrument
air.  This DER demonstrates that Millstone's response to this NRC bulletin is
less than adequate.</P>
<P>MP3 DER 31008 (09/16/96) involving failure of the safety related charging
system if instrument air is lost. The charging system performs the essential
function of core cooling following an accident.  NRC Bulletin 88-xx specifically
requires licensees to review the performance of safety related components for
loss of instrument air.  This DER demonstrates that Millstone's response to this
NRC bulletin is less than adequate.</P>
<P>MP3 DER 30976 (09/06/96) involving failure of 37 solenoid valves upon
failure of non-safety related air pressure regulators.  The DER states that the
solenoid valves effect many safety systems including the charging system and
both the high and low pressure safety injection systems.  NRC Bulletin 88-xx
specifically requires licensees to review the performance of safety related
components for loss of instrument air.  This DER demonstrates that Millstone?s
response to this NRC bulletin is less than adequate.</P>
<P><B>C. Degraded Material Condition</B></P>
<P>CY DER 30945 (08/31/96)  involving a pin hole leak in the RHR heat exchanger
inlet isolation valve.  Following a design basis loss of coolant accident, the
RHR piping containing this isolation valve  extends the reactor coolant pressure
boundary outside primary containment.  This identified integrity loss provides a
pathway for radioactive material to bypass primary containment in the event of
an accident.</P>
<P>MP3 DER 30897 (08/20/96) involving fouling of the containment re-circulation
system heat exchangers by debris.  The DER states that the fouling was thought
to have occurred the previous month when system flow was increased to maximum. 
This DER demonstrates the potential failure of all components cooled by service
water if the strainers and other protective measures have not been adequately
designed to withstand maximum service water flow, as this DER apparently
indicates. This potential may also apply to MP1 and MP2.</P>
<P><B>D. Problems Continuing at Connecticut Yankee After Shutdown</B></P>
<P>CY DER 31126 (10/09/96, 10/21/96) involving a 30-inch longitudinal crack on
the water supply line to the spent fuel pool heat exchanger and a bad weld on a
6-inch service water return line from the spent fuel pool heat exchanger. The
purpose of the supply line is described in this way:</P>
<P>&quot;The spent fuel pit cooling system removes residual heat from the spent
fuel stored in the pit. The spent fuel pit pumps draw water from the pit,
circulate it through a heat exchanger and return it to the pit. There are two
spent fuel pool heat exchangers, a shell and tube type and a plate type.  The
plate heat exchanger has a greater heat removal capacity than the shell and tube
heat exchanger.&quot;</P>
<P>Section 9.1.3.2 of the Connecticut Yankee Updated Final Safety Analysis. 
This DER raises the concern that the material condition of the system used to
cool the irradiated fuel in the Connecticut Yankee (Haddam Neck) spent fuel pool
may have degraded to the point that it is less likely to withstand the loadings
imposed by a seismic event.  In fact, the identified problems indicate that the
material condition of the piping may have degraded to the point where it may be
vulnerable to rupture under normal thermal and dead-weight loadings.</P>
<P>NRC Inspection Report 50-213/96-201 stated that the NRC's special
investigation team into problems at  Connecticut Yankee (Haddam Neck) found
deficiencies which &quot;revealed weaknesses [in systems] that the NRC relies on
to ensure nuclear power plant operation does not jeopardize the health and
safety of the public.&quot;Id.  The team concluded that &quot;weaknesses in your
configuration management processes and a lack of technical rigor, thoroughness,
and attention to detail in the design process, either contributed to or directly
caused the identified errors.&quot; Id.</P>
<P>This inspection report in conjunction with recent de-staffing activities at
Connecticut Yankee (Haddam Neck) raises the concern that appropriate safety
margins may not exist or be maintained at the facility. NU's managers did not
correct the weaknesses in the configuration management processes and the
inattention to detail during the design process prior to the Configuration
Management Project team disbanding. Consequently, there may not be a solid
technical foundation to support prudent decisionmaking at this facility,
particularly as both the NRC and NU continue to reallocate resources to the
Millstone and Seabrook reactors.</P>
<P><B>E. Inadequate Quality Assurance Programs</B></P>
<P>Collectively, the documents summarized above provide persuasive evidence
that the Quality Assurance programs at NU's Connecticut reactors are
significantly flawed.  NRC regulations at 10 CFR part 50, Appendix B, require NU
to have Quality Assurance programs that assure maintenance of the original
design bases and safety margins.  These QA requirements include provisions for
testing, auditing, configuration management, and design control.  NU must
develop an &quot;effective&quot; QA program. &quot;Effective&quot; means meeting
the NRC's Appendix B requirements.</P>
<P><B>F. Material False Statements</B></P>
<P>The NRC issued 50.54(f) letters to NU in the spring of 1996, concerning all
three Millstone nuclear power stations.  NU maintained that the Millstone
nuclear power stations met all applicable design and licensing bases
requirements.  The DERs cited above demonstrate that such statements were false
at the time NU made them, and in some cases, have been false since the initial
start-ups of the Millstone reactors.  The same concerns apply to Connecticut
Yankee.</P>
<P><B>G. Decommissioning And Design/Licensing Basis Deficiencies</B></P>
<P>The new NRC decommissioning rules will allow Connecticut Yankee (Haddam
Neck) to conduct all of its major decommissioning activity under 10 CFR 50.59. 
To safely conduct activities under 50.59,  the licensee must have its design and
licensing bases in order.  At a minimum, this means having an updated FSAR, and
updated, accurate Technical Specification for any of the nuclear power stations
which NU may decide to decommission.</P>
<P>The problem is that Connecticut Yankee's design and licensing bases are so
defective that no one can really perform a valid 50.59 safety analysis.  During
the better part of 1996, staff and management at Connecticut Yankee were in the
process of rebaselining the design and licensing bases in order to provide
reasonable assurance to the NRC that it was safe to permit the reactor to
restart.  Despite the licensee's feverish activity, the NRC's special Inspection
Report of July 31, 1996, documented extremely serious deficiencies in the areas
of design and licensing bases.  Thus, NU had not even come close to resolving
these problems when it announced the shutdown of Connecticut Yankee and began
drastic reductions in staffing levels at the reactor. The point is that if the
NRC decided that NU lacked sufficient knowledge of the licensing and design
bases for staff and management at Connecticut Yankee to be able to safely
restart the reactor, NU plainly does not have sufficient information to conduct
decommissioning under 10 CFR 50.59 as the new rules allow. The same problem
would, of course, apply were NU to attempt to shutdown and begin decommissioning
at any of the other Connecticut reactors.  Wherever deficiencies in the
licensing and design basis exist, safe decommissioning under 50.59 is not
possible without adequate licensing and design bases.</P>
<P><B>V. ABOUT THE PETITIONERS</B></P>
<P>Citizens Awareness Network (CAN) is a non-profit, public interest group with
members located near the Yankee Rowe reactor in Massachusetts, the Vermont
Yankee reactor in Vernon, Vermont, the Connecticut Yankee and Millstone reactors
in Connecticut, and the Seabrook reactor in New Hampshire. CAN is concerned with
the entire nuclear fuel cycle from mining uranium, through operating nuclear
power reactors, to establishing sites for disposal or radioactive waste. CAN
represents citizens in many communities that experience the economic,
environmental, and health impacts of the uranium fuel cycle.  Since 1991, CAN
has participated in a variety of NRC proceedings, including NRC hearings on
reactor embrittlement and decommissioning, rulemakings, workshops, and
adjudicatory hearings.</P>
<P>Nuclear Information and Resource Service (NIRS) is a nonprofit membership
organization dedicated to providing information and assistance to people
concerned about the effects of nuclear power, radioactive waste, and renewable
energy alternatives to nuclear power. NIRS membership is world-wide, including
Connecticut residents whose health and safety are a priority of this petition. 
Since 1978, from its headquarters in Washington, DC, NIRS has, among other
activities, participated in nuclear regulatory affairs, including rulemakings,
enforcement actions, and administrative and judicial adjudications on the
regulation and licensing of particular nuclear power stations.</P>
<P><B>VI. CONCLUSION</B></P>
<P>For the forgoing reasons, petitioners ask the United States Nuclear
Regulatory Commission to grant this petition by immediately commencing: (1)
enforcement action, as detailed above, against Northeast Utilities, and (2) an
investigation, as detailed above, of the role of the NRC directorate management
and staff (NRR), and Region I management and staff in permitting NU to operate
its Connecticut nuclear power stations out of regulatory compliance for over a
decade.</P>
